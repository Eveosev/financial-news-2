LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , owner of the world’s
biggest professional-networking website, said 6.5 million user
passwords were posted on a hacker site, and the company is
working with the FBI on the security breach.  A day after confirming that some accounts were compromised,
the  Mountain View , California-based company disclosed the number
of users affected and said in a  blog post  today that a small
subset of them had their passwords decoded and published.
LinkedIn said it hasn’t received any verified reports of
unauthorized access to member accounts.  “Our first priority was to lock down and protect the
accounts associated with the decoded passwords that we believed
were at the greatest risk,” LinkedIn said. “We’ve invalidated
those passwords and contacted those members with a message that
lets them know how to reset their passwords.”  LinkedIn’s hacking was followed today by revelations that
some customers of  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s Last.fm music site and EHarmony
Inc.’s dating site had passwords stolen. Both companies
suggested that users immediately change their passwords.
LinkedIn, with more than 160 million members, said it has been
investigating the matter “nonstop” since yesterday morning and
is collaborating with  law enforcement  as the probe proceeds.  Erin O’Harra, a spokeswoman at LinkedIn, confirmed that the
company is in contact with the U.S.  Federal Bureau  of
Investigation. Peter Lee, an FBI spokesman in San Francisco,
said the agency has been in contact with LinkedIn since the
incident and is working with the company. He declined to provide
details about the investigation.  LinkedIn  rose  1.1 percent to $94.13 at the close in New
York today. The stock has more than doubled since the company’s
initial public offering in May 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
