Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank would use the discount window or
its emergency lending powers to expand liquidity if dollar
funding is needed in a potential European financial crisis.  The Fed would “use our authority through the discount
window or through our 13.3 authority to lend to financial
institutions against collateral to make sure that lack of
liquidity was not a reason that they would collapse or at least
stop lending,” Bernanke said, citing a section of the Federal
Reserve Act permitting emergency credit.  “That’s the main tool we obviously have in reserve that we
could use and we will use if financial conditions called for
it,” he said. Given the Fed’s experience combating financial
stress in 2008, the central bank is “certainly going to try to
do what is necessary,” the Bernanke said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
