BP Plc (BP/)  and its partners at the Azeri-
Chirag-Guneshli oilfield pumped 15 million metric tons of crude
from the deposit in the first five months of the year,  State Oil
Co. of Azerbaijan ’s first vice president, Xosbaxt Yusifzada,
told a conference in Baku today.  The Caspian-Sea field produced 19 million tons in the first
six months of last year, according to data on BP’s website.
Five-month figures weren’t available. First-quarter output fell
8.3 percent from a year earlier, BP said last month.  Output from the deposit, known as ACG, has been declining
after safety measures were stepped up at oilfields following the
Gulf of Mexico spill in 2010. State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan , or
Socar, is a partner in the project.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, pumped 45.6 million
tons of oil and 25.8 billion cubic meters of gas last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
