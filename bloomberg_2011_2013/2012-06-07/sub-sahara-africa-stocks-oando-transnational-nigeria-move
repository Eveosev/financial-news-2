has interests in hotels, agriculture and oil, gained for a
fourth day as investors bet the company’s expansion plans would
improve earnings.  The stock rose 4.5 percent to 1.16 naira. Transnational
shares, which have  doubled  this year, may increase gains to 1.20
naira this month before investors take profit, said Jimi Ogbobine, an analyst at Lagos-based BGL Group Plc.  “The company now has some fundamentals to back up investor
sentiment,” Ogbobine said by phone today. “People are just
looking for speculative bets to push the price up and book
profit and then move on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
