Crude-oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures fell for the first time this week after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  gave no indication to
lawmakers today that the Fed would soon act to boost growth.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 34.7 percent at 4:15 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up from 33.79 yesterday. Volatility reached
40.56 on June 1, the highest level since Oct. 20.  Crude oil for July delivery declined 20 cents to settle at
$84.82 a barrel on the Nymex.  Bernanke told the congressional Joint Economic Committee
that further rounds of stimulus could boost the economy, yet may
have “diminishing returns.” He also said the economy is at
risk from the Europe debt crisis and the prospect of fiscal
tightening.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were July $90 calls, which fell 10 cents to 12 cents a barrel
with 2,263 lots trading. July $80 puts were the second-most
active options with 1,974 lots changing hands as they rose 10
cents to 55 cents.  Calls accounted for 52 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 52 percent of the 185,185 trades
in the previous session. July $93 calls were the most actively
traded, with 11,966 lots changing hands. They were unchanged at
6 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, July $92 calls,
rose 1 cent to 9 cents on volume of 6,471.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 52,065
contracts. Next were December $70 puts with 37,665 lots and
December $150 calls with 36,023.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
