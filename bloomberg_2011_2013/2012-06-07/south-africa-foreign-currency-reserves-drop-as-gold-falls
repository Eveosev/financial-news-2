South African gross gold and foreign
currency reserves fell for a third month in May as the price of
bullion dropped and the dollar strengthened, reducing the value
of reserves held in euros and pounds.  Gross  reserves  declined 2.1 percent from a month earlier to
$48.9 billion, the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  said on its
website today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of six
economists was $48.8 billion. Net reserves declined to $47.7
billion from $48.8 billion.  “The decrease in the gross reserves was primarily due to
significant valuation adjustments associated with the decline in
the market price of gold and the substantial appreciation of the
 U.S. dollar  against other major currencies,” the central bank
said in the  statement .  The central bank has been buying reserves to help moderate
swings in the value of the rand. The South African currency has
declined 2.7 percent against the dollar this year, adding to an
18 percent drop in 2011. The rand gained 12 percent against the
dollar in 2010 and 29 percent in 2009.  The volatility of the rand creates problems for setting
monetary policy and isn’t “helpful for the real economy,”  Gill Marcus , the bank’s governor, said in a May 8 speech in Zurich.
While the central bank has been active in the foreign-exchange
market to build its reserves, it doesn’t try to set a level for
the currency, she said.  Gold Reserves  Gold reserves, which account for about 13 percent of gross
holdings at the central bank, dropped $390 million to $6.3
billion. The price of gold slumped 6.3 percent in May, reaching
as low as $1,526.97 an ounce.  The rand traded at 8.3120 per dollar at 11:55 a.m. in
Johannesburg, compared with 8.3096 before the data was released.
The yield on the 13.5 percent bond due 2015 fell 2 basis points,
or 0.02 percentage points, to 6.25 percent.  “Uncertainty in financial markets and weaker growth
prospects are likely to persist in the short term,”  Nedbank
Group Ltd. (NED) ,  South Africa ’s fourth largest bank, said in e-mailed
comments. “This will keep the rand volatile, with downside
risks. In this environment the Reserve Bank’s ability to
accumulate foreign exchange reserves will be limited.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
