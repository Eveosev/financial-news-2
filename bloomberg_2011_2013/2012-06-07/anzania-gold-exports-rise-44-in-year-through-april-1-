Gold exports from  Tanzania , which
vies with  Mali  to be  Africa ’s third-biggest producer of the
precious metal, grew 44 percent in the 12 months through April
to $2.3 billion, the Bank of Tanzania said.  The deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of
trade in good and services, more than doubled to $5.5 billion
from $2.5 billion a year earlier, the Dar es Salaam-based
central bank said in a report posted on its  website  today.  “This was partly due to an increase in import of goods,
particularly oil,” the central bank said. The widening current
account was partly responsible for the balance of payments
swinging to a deficit of $163.1 million in the 12 months through
April from a surplus of $45.9 in the same period a year earlier,
the central bank said.  Exports in the year ending April were $7 billion compared
to $6 billion a year earlier. Imports increased 36 percent to
$12.8 billion, according to the report.  Commodity shipments from  East Africa ’s second-biggest
economy declined 3.6 percent to $678 million, mainly due to a
decline in coffee and cashew nut exports and a lower price for
tobacco.  At the end of April, foreign-exchange reserves stood at
$3.5 billion, enough to cover 3.7 months of projected imports,
while external debt was $10 billion, the central bank said.  Following are agricultural exports in the 12 months through
April over the past two years:
