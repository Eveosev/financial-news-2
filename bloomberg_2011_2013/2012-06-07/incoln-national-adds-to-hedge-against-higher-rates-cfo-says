Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) , the insurer
that repaid a $950 million U.S. bailout, has increased
protection to guard against higher interest rates.  “We’ve taken advantage over the last couple of years to
add to our portfolio of hedges against rising interest rates,”
Randal Freitag, chief financial officer of the Radnor,
Pennsylvania-based insurer, said today at a conference sponsored
by Standard & Poor’s in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
