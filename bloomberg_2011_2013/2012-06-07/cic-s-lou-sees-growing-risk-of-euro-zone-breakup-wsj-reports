China  Investment Corp. sees growing
risks of a breakup of the euro area, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing  Lou Jiwei , chairman of the Chinese sovereign
wealth fund.  CIC reduced its exposure to European peripheral countries a
long time ago without incurring any losses and has cut its
holdings of stocks and bonds across the continent, the newspaper
reported today, citing an interview with Lou. He didn’t identify
the peripheral nations, according to the report.  “There is a risk that the euro zone may fall apart and
that risk is rising,” the Wall Street Journal reported Lou as
saying. “Right now we find there is too much risk in  Europe ’s
public markets.”  Europe isn’t ready to issue any common euro-zone bonds and
any such debt won’t be a suitable investment for CIC because the
risk is too big and the return too low, the report said, citing
Lou. The fund will continue to invest in Europe by focusing on
private equity and direct investment including infrastructure,
Lou was cited as saying.  China should open up its capital account and make the  yuan 
a fully convertible currency, which would lead to a natural
diversification of its foreign-exchange reserves and it may be
time to do so after the  European debt crisis  ebbs, the report
said, citing Lou’s comments.  The European Union is made up of 27 member states.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Tomoko Yamazaki, Andreea Papuc  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
