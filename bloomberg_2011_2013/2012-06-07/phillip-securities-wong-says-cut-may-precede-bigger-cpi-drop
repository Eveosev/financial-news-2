Louis Wong, director at Phillip
Securities HK Ltd., comments by phone on  China ’s decision to cut
 interest rates  for the first time since 2008.  “I think it is part of the stimulus package to prop up the
economy but the market is a bit caught by surprise of the
timing, that it comes ahead of the release of the CPI economic
data. It may indicate that there is a bigger drop in the CPI.”  “It goes to show that cutting the reserve requirement
ratio may not be sufficient to stimulate the economy, so now
they have resorted to cutting interest rates.”  “The Australian central bank has cut interest rates so
China wants to keep up with other central banks in terms of
monetary easing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
