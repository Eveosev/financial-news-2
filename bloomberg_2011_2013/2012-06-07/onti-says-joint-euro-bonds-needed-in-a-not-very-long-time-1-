The 17 members of Europe’s single
currency should start jointly selling debt and find ways for the
region’s banks to boost capital without burdening their national
governments, Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said.  Speaking by video link to a conference in Palermo, Monti
said that euro bonds should be adopted in “a not very long
time.”  The debate over debt sharing has exposed differences among
the leaders of Europe’s biggest countries as they try to devise
a common strategy to reduce borrowing costs.  Chancellor Angela
Merkel  said on June 3 that “under no circumstances” would she
agree to have Germany back euro bonds, while French President
 Francois Hollande  and Monti have embraced the possibility of
common debt.  It’s important that the proposal “remain on the table”
and that it doesn’t become “an instrument of division between
countries that must find a consensus rapidly and demonstrate
their cohesion,” Monti said.  Monti is seeking to help broker a common strategy by
hosting a meeting in  Rome  with Merkel, Hollande and Spanish
Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on June 22.  The euro area needs a deeper fiscal and financial union
that would include regional oversight of lenders and collective
bank deposit guarantees, the Italian premier also said.  “ We need to quickly act to put an end to the vicious
circle between the vulnerability of the banking sector and the
sovereign debt crisis,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
