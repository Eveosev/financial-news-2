Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V) ,  Finland ’s only oil
refiner, rose to its highest in a week as Pohjola Bank raised
its recommendation on the shares and said next year’s profit 
from renewable fuels will drive the stock price.  Neste climbed as high as 7.84 euros in Helsinki trading,
adding 2.5 percent to 7.82 euros at 11:52 a.m., extending gains
for a third consecutive day. The company was the day’s second-
biggest gainer on the OMX Helsinki 25 Index.  Pohjola raised its  recommendation  from accumulate, setting
its sights on Neste’s 2013 earnings, the bank said in a note 
today. Renewable fuels produced by the Espoo-based company are 
attractively valued in the share price, Pohjola said, predicting 
a profit of 74 million euros ($92.9 million) for the unit next 
year. The unit had a 170 million-euro operating loss in 2011.  Demand for renewable fuels is increasing as tightening
regulation and rising prices reduce the use of fossil fuels. The
price of crude oil has tripled in 10 years, propelling a search
for alternative raw materials for energy production.  Neste Oil is making diesel for cars and trucks using fat
from gutting pangasius, an Asian catfish. Deutsche Lufthansa AG
tested its renewable  aviation fuel , saying it's “ready for use 
in daily aircraft operation,” according to a March 15 statement.  Neste Oil also benefits from the euro’s weakening versus
the dollar as it incurs most costs in euros and its sales are
dollar-denominated. Pohjola kept its 12-month target price for
Neste Oil at 10.50 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
