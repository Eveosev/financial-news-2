Song Yu, an economist at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., comments on China’s decision to lower  interest
rates  for the first time since 2008. Song gave the comments in a
note today.  “We believe the cut is a clear and strong signal to the
market of the loosening policy stance. It reflects the concerns
of the top leadership on slowing economic growth and the
relatively benign view on inflation.  ‘‘By now, the May data is already compiled, though not
publicly announced. It is likely this data was still be on the
weak side. We still believe May activity data would be
incrementally better than it was in April, but probably is still
deemed to be too weak by senior policymakers. We think the rate
cut could help to alleviate the financial burdens of firms and
boost demand for loans.  ‘‘We believe interest rates will be cut again later in the
year, likely in the third quarter in 2012. We expect multiple
required reserve-ratio cuts, which can happen at any time. We
reiterate the quantity of liquidity holds the key, and we expect
the monetary authorities to be on the relatively loose side of
policymaking.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
