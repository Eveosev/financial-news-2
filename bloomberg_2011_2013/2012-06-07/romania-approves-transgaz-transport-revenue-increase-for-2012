Romania ’s energy-market regulator
approved a 2012 transport-revenue increase of almost 5 percent
for natural-gas grid operator  Transgaz SA (TGN) , before a planned sale
of a minority stake in the company.  The utility’s transport revenue for this year was set at
1.146 billion lei ($323 million) by the regulator, from 1.09
billion lei posted last year, according to a June 1 decision
posted on the National Energy Regulatory Authority’s  website .  Transgaz’s transport revenue and tariffs are set by the
authority over regulatory periods. The next regulatory period is
from 2012 through 2017.  Romania’s government plans to sell a 15 percent of Transgaz
through the Bucharest Stock Exchange by the end of June to meet
the terms of precautionary loans from the International Monetary
Fund and the European Union. It will try to sell state energy
assets this year, as  Europe ’s debt crisis roils global stock
markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
