India  may export 5 million metric
tons of wheat in the 2012-13 marketing year after a record-high
national harvest, said N. Sharan, a director in the country’s
Department of Food and Public Distribution.  India, the world’s second-biggest wheat producer, began
allowing exports of the grain in September, Sharan said in an
interview today after a speech at the International Grains
Council’s annual conference in  London . India banned private
companies from shipping wheat in early 2007 and non-basmati rice
in April 2008 to bolster domestic supplies amid a global food
crisis. Since September, the country has shipped about 4 million
tons of rice, Sharan said.  “Tenders have been floated and we’re doing pricing” for
wheat, he said. “Once we get a suitable price, it will be
exported.”  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates that India’s
wheat harvest will total 91 million tons in the 2012-13 year, a
fifth consecutive record. The country’s crop is second only to
China’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
