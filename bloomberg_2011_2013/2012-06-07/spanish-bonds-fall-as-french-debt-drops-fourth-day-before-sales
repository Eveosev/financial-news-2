Spanish bonds surged, driving 10-year
yields down by the most in more than two weeks, after the
government beat its maximum target at a debt sale, easing
concern the nation may be forced to seek international aid.  Yields on  Spain ’s two- and five-year securities tumbled by
at least 30 basis points and 10-year bonds extended its longest
rally since February after  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said  Germany 
is ready to back the use of existing euro-area instruments to
help stabilize the 17-nation currency bloc. French bonds slid
after an auction of 7.8 billion euros ($9.8 billion) of debt.
German, Austrian, Belgian and Dutch bonds fell as a Chinese
interest-rate cut damped demand for the region’s safest assets.  “There was a big move downward in Spanish yields going
into the auction, which seemed to have been driven by the hope
that there is shortly to be joint action by several of the major
central banks,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income
strategist at Rabobank International in  London . “Spain can
clearly still borrow in the markets but it must pay high yields
for the privilege.”  Spain’s 10-year yield tumbled 19 basis points, or 0.19
percentage point, to 6.09 percent at 5:02 p.m. London time. The
5.85 percent securities due January 2022 climbed 1.360, or 13.60
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 98.265. The decline was the
most since May 22, when the rate slid 20 basis points. The six-
day rally is the longest since the period ended Feb. 27.  Spanish Auction  The two-year yield sank 31 basis points to 4.23 percent,
with the five-year rate 30 basis points lower at 5.35 percent.
Yields on 10-year German bunds, the euro area’s benchmark
government securities, rose five basis points to 1.38 percent.  Spain sold 2.07 billion euros of securities, the central
bank said, surpassing the maximum target of 2 billion euros.
Investors bought 611 million euros of benchmark 10-year bonds at
an average yield of 6.044 percent, up from 5.743 percent at the
previous auction on April 19.  The results were “pretty decent overall and the market
appears eminently comfortable with the outcome,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in London. “A
tad above the top end of the target volume range obviously looks
good, but I think the more encouraging factor was that the 2022
bond came at 6.04 percent, so safely below levels prevailing in
the secondary market.”  Spain’s 30-year bond yield declined 16 basis points to 6.27
percent, falling for the sixth consecutive day.  Investors are “sensing” a resolution for Spain as that
nation tries to shore up its lenders, said  Andrew Bosomworth , a
 money manager  at Pacific Investment Management Co., manager of
the world’s biggest bond fund.  French Bonds  Market participants “think a solution is on the horizon
for Spain,” Bosomworth said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
- The First Word” with Ken Prewitt.  France ’s 10-year bonds dropped for a fourth day as the
nation auctioned 3.48 billion euros of the securities at an
average yield of 2.46 percent, lower than the 2.96 percent in
the prior sale on May 3.  The country also sold 685 million euros in 50-year bonds
for the first time since 2010.  The French 10-year yield advanced 16 basis points to 2.57
percent after falling to a record 2.071 percent on June 1. The
two-year yield increased seven basis points to 0.52 percent,
while the rate on the April 2060 bond jumped 17 basis points to
3.37 percent.  German bunds declined for a second day after  China  cut
 interest rates  for the first time since 2008, stepping up
efforts to combat a deepening economic slowdown.  China Cuts  The People’s Bank of China said the one-year deposit rate
will drop to 3.25 percent from 3.5 percent effective tomorrow.  “There’s speculation that there may be some coordinated
policy response from central banks, and that’s benefiting Spain
and weighing on bunds and other semi-core markets,” Rabobank’s
Graham-Taylor said.  The German 10-year yield earlier climbed to 1.42 percent,
the highest since May 25. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  of shares
gained 1.1 percent.  Austrian 10-year yields climbed 15 basis points to 2.24
percent. Similar-maturity Belgian rates jumped 15 basis points
to 3.02 percent, while the yield on 10-year Dutch bonds rose
eight basis points to 1.84 percent.  Sweden’s bonds slumped after the financial regulator
removed a key incentive for life insurers and pension funds to
buy the securities as yields tumbled to a record low. The 10-
year yield surged 32 basis points to 1.46 percent. Norway’s
similar-maturity yield rose 14 basis points to 1.90 percent.  Swedish Volatility  Volatility on Swedish  government bonds  was the highest in
developed markets today, followed by Austria and  Belgium ,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield
spreads and credit-default swaps.  U.K. gilts fell after the  Bank of England  kept its asset-
purchase  program  on hold at 325 billion pounds. Policy makers
also kept the  benchmark  interest rate at a record-low 0.5
percent. The 10-year gilt yield climbed six basis points to 1.72
percent.  Spanish securities have lost 3.5 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. French debt returned
5.9 percent, with German bonds gaining 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
