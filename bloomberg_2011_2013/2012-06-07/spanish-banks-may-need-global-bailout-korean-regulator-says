South Korea ’s Financial Services
Commission Chairman Kim Seok Dong comments on  Spain ’s banking
industry and the European debt crisis. Kim spoke to reporters
today in Seoul.  On Spanish banking crisis:  “If it becomes hard for Spain to rescue its banks with its
own budget, then the international community may need to get
involved.  ‘‘There’re views that the crisis in Spain’s banking
industry may be more severe than the country’s government can
handle. Should things go that way, Europe and the IMF may need
to provide bailout funds. If that happens it will squeeze the
overall European banking industry and bring much economic
difficulty.”  On South Korea’s crisis preparedness:  “We’ve taken preemptive steps since last year such as
restructuring the savings bank industry, checking the growth of
 household debt  and boosting banks’ foreign-currency liquidity.
It’ll take a while until the crisis in Europe is resolved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
