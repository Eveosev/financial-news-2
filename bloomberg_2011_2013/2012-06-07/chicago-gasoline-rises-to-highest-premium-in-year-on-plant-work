Chicago gasoline strengthened to its
largest premium over futures in a year as several refineries ran
below planned rates because of maintenance.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago rose 5.5 cents
to 28 cents a barrel above futures on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange at 2:34 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the largest gap since June 2, 2011.  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting, Indiana, refinery, the largest plant
servicing the Chicago market, will try this weekend to restart a
section of a crude unit that was shut May 31 for unplanned
repairs, a person with knowledge of the operations said.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  began maintenance at its Robinson,
Illinois, refinery, Shane Pochard, a spokesman at the company’s
headquarters in Findlay, Ohio, said in an e-mailed statement.  Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s refinery in Lemont, Illinois, shut
most of its main production units for maintenance May 1, a
person familiar with plant operations said.  Conventional gasoline in the Midwest strengthened 0.75 cent
to a premium of 7.5 cents.  The discount for conventional gasoline in the  Gulf Coast 
narrowed 1.5 cents to 8.63 cents a gallon.  Chicago ultra low-sulfur diesel gained 1.5 cents to 20
cents over Nymex heating oil futures, the highest level since
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
