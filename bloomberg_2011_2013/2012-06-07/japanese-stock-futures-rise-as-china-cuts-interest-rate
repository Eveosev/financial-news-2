Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
rose, with the Nikkei 225 Average poised for its first weekly
gain in 10 weeks, after China cut its benchmark interest for the
first time since 2008.  American Depositary Receipts  of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s largest mining company, climbed 3.1 percent from the
closing price in Sydney. ADRs of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a Japanese
mining-equipment maker, gained 0.8 percent.  Terumo Corp. (4543)  may be
active in Tokyo after Barclays Plc recommended buying shares of
Asia’s largest medical devices company.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 8,620 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,610 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,650 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index advanced 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “It does show Beijing is willing to do whatever it takes
to support growth and to boost confidence,” said  Qu Hongbin ,
Hong Kong-based co-head of economic research at HSBC Holdings
Plc. “Get ready for more decisive easing.”  China  cut borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 and
loosened controls on banks’ lending and deposit rates, stepping
up efforts to combat a deepening slowdown as Europe’s debt
crisis threatens global growth.  The benchmark one-year lending rate  will drop  to 6.31
percent from 6.56 percent effective today, the People’s Bank of
China said on its website yesterday. The one-year deposit rate
will fall to 3.25 percent from 3.5 percent.  Buy Chinese  Billionaire  Kenneth Fisher , who bought  Chinese shares  as
they rallied from a 2-1/2 year low in the fourth quarter, said
the stocks will beat global equities as the government takes
further steps to boost growth.  China will loosen monetary policy for another 12 to 18
months after yesterday’s announcement, Fisher, chief executive
officer of Fisher Investments, said in a telephone interview
yesterday. China represents about 6 percent of the Woodside,
California-based firm’s holdings, a bigger proportion than in
benchmark indexes, Fisher said.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. rose 0.5 percent to 90.62 in New
York for a three-day advance of 4.5 percent, the biggest since
March 9.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The gauge closed little changed yesterday, paring
earlier gains as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the central bank will assess the U.S. economy before deciding if
more stimulus is needed and after a report that Greece’s
upcoming election could be derailed.  Spain Rating  In Spain, Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said he’s talking to
his European peers about how to shore up the country’s banks as
 Fitch Ratings  cut Spain’s credit grade to within two steps of
junk. Spain is trying to overcome German opposition to allowing
the euro region’s bailout funds to sidestep governments and
recapitalize lenders directly.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific (MXAP)  posted its biggest three-day gain
since Dec. 5 through yesterday amid speculation global policy
makers will move to stimulate economic growth. The Asian
benchmark gauge has still dropped 12 percent from its peak this
year on Feb. 29. amid concern growth is slowing in China and the
U.S. as Europe’s debt crisis deepens.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific fell 0.7 percent  this year  through
yesterday, compared with a 0.8 percent drop on the Stoxx Europe
600 Index and a 4.6 percent gain on the S&P 500. Declines in
regional equity markets cut the average price of stocks on the
Asian benchmark to 11.5 times estimated earnings. That compares
with 12.6 times for the  S&P 500  and a multiple of 10.1 for the
Stoxx 600.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum gained 1.2
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
