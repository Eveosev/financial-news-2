Bank of Nova Scotia  has issued $60.8
million of structured notes in the U.S. this year, already
surpassing its total for all of 2011.  The bank has completed eight deals, compared with two
offerings for $7 million last year, the lowest total of any
issuer in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The bank has increased sales even as the market drops.
Total issuance in the U.S. fell 16 percent to $18.3 billion in
the first five months of 2012, compared with the year-earlier
period, Bloomberg data show.  Andrew Chornenky, a spokesman for the Toronto-based lender,
declined to comment.  The bank is  rated  Aa1 by Moody’s Investors Service, the
second-highest investment grade, and AA- by Standard & Poor’s
and Fitch Ratings, the fourth-highest. Only the Royal Bank of
Canada, which has the highest credit rating of structured note
issuers in the U.S., has a higher grade from Fitch.  On April 10, Scotiabank sold $27.3 million in 13-month
notes tied to the Tokyo Stock  Price Index , or Topix. The
securities, issued April 10, yield the returns of the index,
according to a  prospectus  filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The bank distributed the notes for a 0.25 percent
fee.  Suntrust Banks Inc. (STI) , which had the second-lowest sales last
year, has issued $23.5 million of structured notes in 2012, more
than the total for all of 2011, Bloomberg data show. The
Atlanta-based bank sold $14.9 million of fixed-to-floating rate
notes on March 13, its largest deal since at least the beginning
of 2010, Bloomberg data show.  Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are
contracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities.
