Spanish  house prices  may decline as
much as 52 percent in a period of economic stress, according to
Moody’s Investors Service.  The forecast decline is based on a model combining factors
such as homes price increases in the last 10 years and
unemployment rates, analysts including London-based Nitesh Shah
said in a June 6 note. U.K. home prices are the second most at
risk in Europe, facing the prospect of a 42 percent drop.  The house-price stress rate is among elements the New York-
based rating company used to update its methodology assessing
residential mortgage-backed securities transactions in Europe. A
total 27 transactions face negative rating actions as a result
of the changes, the company said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
