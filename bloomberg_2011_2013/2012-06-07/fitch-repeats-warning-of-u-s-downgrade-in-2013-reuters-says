The U.S. may lose its AAA rating next
year unless politicians reach an agreement to significantly cut
the  budget deficit , an analyst at  Fitch Ratings  said.  The U.S. lacks a credible plan to reduce spending and stop
the growth of the national debt,  Edward Parker , a sovereign
analyst, said at the firm’s Global Banking Conference in New
York, according to Reuters. The comments were consistent with
the third-biggest ratings firm’s statements in November, when it
assigned a negative outlook to the U.S. and said the probability
of a downgrade is greater than 50 percent over two years.  Standard & Poor’s , the world’s largest ratings company,
downgraded the U.S. to AA+ in August, saying lawmakers had
failed to agree on enough budget cuts. Moody’s Investors Service,
the second-largest, has had a negative outlook on the country’s
Aaa rating since August.  Fitch’s analysts didn’t announce any changes to their views
at the conference, Brian Bertsch, a spokesman in  New York , said
in an e-mail.  Fitch forecasts federal public debt will exceed 90 percent
of gross domestic product by the end of the decade unless the
government addresses rising health and social security spending
through tax increases or reductions in expenditures.  The “high and rising federal and general government debt
burden is not consistent with the U.S. retaining its AAA status
even with its other fundamental sovereign credit strengths,”
Fitch said Dec. 21 in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
