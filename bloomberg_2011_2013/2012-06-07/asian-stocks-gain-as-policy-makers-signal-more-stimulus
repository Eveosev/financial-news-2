Asian stocks climbed, with the
benchmark regional gauge heading for its biggest three-day gain
this year, as global policy makers signaled they may take steps
to stimulate economic growth. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index ticked
higher as China cut interest rates after most markets closed.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company,
advanced 1.5 percent in Sydney as Australian employment
unexpectedly rose in May, driven by hiring amid the nation’s
minerals boom. Mitsubishi Corp., the No. 1 Japanese trading
house, rose 1.2 percent and Komatsu Ltd., a mining-equipment
maker, gained 2.1 percent in Tokyo as investors bought shares of
companies with profits closely tied to economic growth.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific (MXAP)  rose 1.5 percent to 113.33 as of 8:11
p.m. in Tokyo, poised for its biggest three-day gain since Dec.
5, with more than three shares advancing for every one that
fell. The gauge is priced in U.S. dollars, which  fell  after
China’s interest rate cut, boosting the relative value of stocks
in the index.  The Asian benchmark gauge has dropped 12 percent from its
peak this year on Feb. 29. amid concern growth is slowing in
 China  and the U.S. as Europe’s debt crisis deepens.  “Any time central bankers give us a promise that they’re
going to inject some more liquidity into the markets, risk
assets start to rally, and that’s precisely what’s happened,”
 Arjuna Mahendran , Singapore-based head of Asia investment
strategy at HSBC Private Bank, which manages about $556 billion,
said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “We could have a risk rally
going on for a while.”  Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 1.2 percent, South Korea’s Kospi
Index advanced 2.6 percent as it resumed after a holiday
yesterday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.9 percent. China’s
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.7 percent.  Australian Boom  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  jumped 1.3 percent after a
government report showed employers added 38,900 workers last
month. Economists had forecast no change. The employment report
came a day after data showed  Australia ’s economy expanded twice
as fast as economists had forecast in the first quarter as
resource investment surged.  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said slowing job
growth and deteriorating financial-market conditions show the
U.S. economy “remains vulnerable to setbacks” and may warrant
additional monetary stimulus. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
President  Dennis Lockhart  said extending Operation Twist, the
central bank’s stimulus program that lengthens maturities of
debt on its balance sheet, is an “option on the table.”  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao vowed last month to focus more
on increasing growth after trade and domestic demand were below
forecasts in April.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy
makers discussed cutting  interest rates  yesterday and officials
stand ready to act as the euro region’s growth outlook worsens.  “The Chinese will take action to stimulate the economy and
the Americans will similarly respond with an extension of
Operation Twist or more quantitative easing,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1 billion at Platypus Asset
Management Ltd. in Sydney. “For a sustained rally, we need a
period of stability where we’re not in a fire-fighting-crisis
mode.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6
percent today. The gauge soared 2.3 percent yesterday, its
biggest gain of the year.  Annual Drop  The MSCI Asia-Pacific fell 2 percent  this year  through
yesterday, compared with a 1.9 percent drop on the Stoxx Europe
600 Index and a 4.6 percent gain on the  S&P 500 . Declines in
regional equity markets cut the average price of stocks on the
Asian benchmark to 11.3 times estimated earnings. That compares
with 12.6 times for the S&P 500 and a multiple of 10 for the
Stoxx 600.  Export-related companies in Japan rose after the yen
weakened, boosting overseas earnings prospects.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) 
gained 1.2 percent to 1,552 yen and Komatsu advanced 2.1 percent
to 1,884 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer
electronics, jumped 2 percent to 1,072 yen. Canon Inc., a
Japanese camera maker that gets about 80 percent of revenue
outside Japan, gained 3.4 percent to 3,185 yen.  Inpex Corp., Japan’s top energy explorer, advanced 3.3
percent to 454,000 yen as oil climbed for a fourth day.  Cnooc
Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore oil producer, gained 1.9 percent
to HK$14.04.  Oil Rises  Oil for July delivery increased 8 cents to $85.10 a barrel
in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
4:04 p.m. Sydney time.  BHP Billiton  advanced 1.5 percent to A$31.58.  Rio Tinto
Group (RIO) , the world’s third-largest mining company, gained 2.2
percent to A$55.42. Posco, the world’s third-biggest steelmaker
by output, rose 2.1 percent to 365,000 won in Seoul.  The S&P GSCI gauge of commodities gained 1.3 percent
yesterday.  Ricoh Co. gained 4.1 percent to 591 yen in Tokyo after
Deutsche Bank AG advised buying shares of the imaging company.  Brambles Ltd. (BXB) , the world’s largest supplier of warehouse
pallets, fell 5 percent to A$6.42 in Sydney after scrapping the
sale of a unit and selling new stock at a discount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
