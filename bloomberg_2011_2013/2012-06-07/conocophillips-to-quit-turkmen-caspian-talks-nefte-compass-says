ConocoPhillips (COP)  has decided to close
its Turkmenistan office and stop negotiations for access to
Block 19 in the  Caspian Sea ,  Nefte Compass  said, citing
unidentified company officials speaking in Baku, Azerbaijan.  Difficulties with the Central Asian “geopolitical
environment” and over exports of potential natural-gas output
led ConocoPhillips to pull out of the Turkmen talks, which it
was conducting with partner Mubadala Oil & Gas of Abu Dhabi,
Nefte Compass said, citing the same people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
