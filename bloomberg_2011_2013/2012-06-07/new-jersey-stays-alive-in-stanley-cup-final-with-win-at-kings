Adam Henrique scored with 4 1/2
minutes left and the  New Jersey Devils  avoided elimination with
a 3-1 win against the Los Angeles Kings in the Stanley Cup
Final.  The Kings still lead three games to one in the best-of-
seven series to determine the  National Hockey League â€™s champion.  Game 5 is set for June 9 at the Prudential Center in
Newark, New Jersey.  After the teams played two scoreless periods, Patrik Elias
gave New Jersey a 1-0 lead 7:56 into the third period when he
backhanded a rebound past Los Angeles goalie Jonathan Quick.  The Kings tied the game 62 seconds later on a power-play
goal by Drew Doughty on a slapshot from just inside the blue
line.  Henrique got his fourth goal of the playoffs with 4:31 left
in the third period on a wristshot.  Ilya Kovalchuk  added an
empty-net goal in the final minute.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
