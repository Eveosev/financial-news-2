The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development plans to lend 50 million euros ($63 million) to
the state-run rail transport company in the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, pending board approval Sept. 4.  The sovereign-guaranteed loan to  Makedonski Zeleznici
Transport AD  would support the renewal of rolling stock with an
average age of 30 to 45 years, the London-based lender said on
its  website .  The funds will finance the purchase of passenger and
freight cars, the overhaul of locomotives, and consulting
services, the EBRD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
