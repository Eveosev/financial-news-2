Helen Qiao, chief economist for
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  Asia Ltd., comments on China’s decision to cut
interest rates for the first time since 2008.  “I think that’s in line with our expectation. As we
argued, interest rate cuts in both lending and deposit rates
will help boost both investment and consumption. Lowering the
funding cost in the economy to help support investment projects
is the right thing to do.”  “We now have one more interest rate cut in our forecast
left and possible RRR cuts.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
