Spanish soccer coach Manuel Preciado
died of a heart attack, a day after agreeing to become coach of
the  Villarreal  team. He was 54.  Preciado died last night, Villarreal said on its website.
He had been scheduled to hold his first news conference as its
coach tomorrow.  He was Sporting coach from 2006 to January this year,
leading it into  Spain ’s top-tier La Liga in 2008 after a decade
in the second division. He oversaw 232 games for Sporting, more
than any other of its coaches apart from Jose Manuel Diaz.
Preciado had shorter coaching stints at Levante, Murcia and
 Racing Santander .  Preciado was fired by Sporting in mid-season with the team
second-last in La Liga. Both Sporting and Villarreal, a
Champions League semfinalist in 2006 and La Liga runner-up in
2008, were eventually relegated.  In 2010, Preciado called  Jose Mourinho  a “scumbag” after
the Real Madrid coach questioned Sporting’s effort in losing 1-0
to Barcelona. They later made up, became friends and Preciado
visited Mourinho at Real Madrid’s training ground while out of
work in March of this year.  Preciado’s Sporting beat Real 1-0 at Santiago Bernabeu
stadium in April last year, handing Mourinho his first home loss
as a coach in nine years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
