The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
jumped 1.3 percent to 892.90 at the close in Prague, a fourth
day of gains and the longest winning streak in four months.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , a unit of Societe Generale SA,
added 4 percent to 3,350 koruna, a fifth day of gains and the
steepest one-day rally in four months.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   of Austria rose 0.9 percent to 369 koruna.  Financial stocks were among the biggest gainers in Europe
on speculation more policy makers around the world will take
steps to revive slowing growth after China, the world’s second-
biggest economy, cut  interest rates .  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, climbed 4.6 percent to 101.5 koruna, its fourth
day of gains, as commodities including oil and copper rallied.  China’s rate cut “supported commodity prices and hence
also mining and energy stocks,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at
Komercni Banka AS in Prague, wrote in an e-mail to clients
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
