Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , which began selling
K-Cups at grocery stores last year, will offer the single-
serving portion packs for  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) ’s
Keurig brewers in its U.S. cafes to bolster sales.  Starbucks, which also offers Tazo tea K-Cups, will begin
selling the portion packs at its more than 10,800 U.S. stores on
June 12, according to Lisa Passe, a spokeswoman for the Seattle-
based company.  Last month, Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said
that Starbucks brand K-Cups “continue to see robust gains.”
Schultz has also said that the company’s relationship with Green
Mountain Coffee Roasters is “strong.”  Starbucks was little changed at $53.44 at the close in New
York. Waterbury, Vermont-based Green Mountain dropped 0.9
percent to $24.30.  Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. (DNKN)  and  Caribou Coffee Co. (CBOU)  also offer
K-Cups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
