The Obama administration today said
it supports passage of the farm bill being considered by the
Senate, legislation that would overhaul U.S. agriculture policy
by ending direct payments to growers.  “With authorization for farm- and food-related programs
set to expire this year, it is critical that the Congress pass
legislation that provides certainty for rural America and
includes needed reforms and savings,” President  Barack Obama ’s
Office of Management and Budget said in a policy  statement .  Under the bill approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee
in April, direct payments -- made regardless of crop prices --
would be replaced with an expanded insurance initiative called
the “shallow-loss” program. The change would provide the bulk
of savings in the bill, which the  Congressional Budget Office 
estimates at $23.6 billion over 10 years.  The Senate cleared a procedural hurdle on the measure this
morning, advancing the bill on a 90-8 vote. Dozens of amendments
have already been filed to the measure.  The measure is S. 3240.  To contact the reporter on this story:
