The ruble strengthened for a fourth
day against the dollar and yields on Russia’s local debt
declined on speculation policy makers will take steps to revive
slowing economic growth, boosting riskier assets.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 32.25 per
dollar by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the strongest level since
May 29. Russia’s 140 billion rubles ($4.3 billion) of domestic
OFZ bonds due August 2016 gained, cutting the yield by 30 basis
points, or 0.3 percentage point, to 7.91 percent.  China  cut borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 and
loosened controls on banks’ lending and deposit rates, stepping
up efforts to combat a deepening economic slowdown. European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said officials stand ready
to act as the euro region’s growth outlook worsens.  “The ruble continues to win back the losses suffered in
May,” Moscow-based Broker Credit Service wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients. “The situation on the international markets is
what’s contributing to these dynamics in Russian foreign
exchange.”  The ruble was little changed at 40.55 per euro and
appreciated 0.3 percent to 35.985 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket. Investors increased bets on the
currency weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing the
ruble at 32.7555 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 32.8202 per dollar yesterday.  The yield on  Russia ’s Eurobonds due 2015 dropped five basis
points to 2.311 percent. Dollar-denominated debt due the same
year from OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, yielded five
basis points less than yesterday at 3.842 percent, while the
yield on state gas monopoly OAO Gazprom’s 2015 Eurobonds slipped
15 basis points to 3.735 percent.  The cost of insuring Russian bonds against nonpayment over
five years with credit default swaps dropped 15 basis points to
246 basis points, the lowest on a closing basis since May 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
