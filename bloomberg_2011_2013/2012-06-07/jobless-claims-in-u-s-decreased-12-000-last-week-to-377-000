Fewer Americans applied for
 unemployment  insurance payments last week, indicating limited
progress in the labor market after a two-month slowdown in
hiring.  First-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 12,000 to
377,000 in the week ended June 2 from a revised 389,000 the
prior week that was higher than initially estimated, the  Labor
Department  said today. The median estimate of 49 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for 378,000 claims. The number
of people receiving extended payments plunged.  The claims figures may ease concern of further labor market
weakness after a report last week showed employers in May added
the fewest workers in a year. While sustained demand is
encouraging companies to maintain headcounts, stronger sales may
be required to prompt a pickup in hiring.  “It’s pretty clear claims are stabilizing,” said  Michael Englund , chief economist at Action Economics LLC in Boulder,
 Colorado , who forecast 375,000 claims. “It’s hard to make the
case that there’s any upward tilt to growth,” so companies are
being cautious, he said.  Estimates ranged from 367,000 to 390,000 after an initially
reported 383,000 in the previous week, according to the
Bloomberg survey.  Stock-index futures maintained gains after the figure and
following an interest-rate cut by  China . The contract on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring this month climbed 0.7
percent to 1,324.3 at 8:41 a.m. in  New York .  Four-Week Average  The  four-week  moving average of claims, a less-volatile
measure, climbed to 377,750, the highest in a month, from
376,000.  The number of people  continuing to collect  jobless benefits
increased 34,000 in the week ended May 26 to 3.29 million. The
continuing claims figure does not include the number of workers
receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments slumped by almost
105,000 in the week ended May 19 to 2.83 million.  California , Florida,  Illinois  and Texas were among eight
states that no longer qualified for emergency benefits as of May
12, according to a National Employment Law Project study. From
April 7 through May 12, about 370,000 Americans in 23 states
stopped getting the assistance, which provide payments for as
long as 99 weeks, the study said.  States and Territories  The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 2.6 percent in
the week ended May 26, today’s report showed. Thirty-seven
states and territories reported an increase in claims, while one
reported a decrease.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth accelerates. The  unemployment rate  rose to
8.2 percent in May, while employers added 69,000 jobs, the
fewest in a year, after 77,000 in April. The  unemployment rate 
has been above 8 percent since February 2009, the longest such
stretch since monthly records began in 1948.  Supervalu Inc. (SVU) , the third-largest U.S. grocery store chain,
plans to eliminate as many as 2,500 positions at its Albertsons
unit. The reductions, which will occur across all 247 Albertsons
stores in California and Nevada, will begin the week of June 17
and should be completed near July 1, according to a statement
yesterday. Albertsons is the biggest retail chain in Supervalu’s
family of grocery stores. As of February, the company had about
130,000 employees, according to regulatory filings.  Fed Policy  The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday in its Beige Book
assessment of the economy that hiring was “steady or showed a
modest increase” from early April to late May. The report gives
central bankers anecdotal evidence on the health of the economy
two weeks before they meet in Washington.  The Fed is debating whether to step up accommodation after
May’s payroll report. Chicago Fed President  Charles Evans  said
in a June 4 speech that “soft” U.S. economic data call for
“extremely strong accommodation,” while  Richard Fisher  of
Dallas said more Fed bond purchases would be “pushing on a
string.” Chairman  Ben Bernanke  is scheduled to testify to
Congress later today.  So far,  consumer spending  is holding up, said Lawrence Peiros, chief operating officer of  Clorox Co. (CLX)  in Oakland,
California, which markets consumer products under brands
including Burts Bees, Kingsford charcoal, Liquid-Plumr.  “The economy is starting to recover and we’re actually
seeing the first signs of some positive growth,” Peiros said in
a May 31 analyst meeting. “Our categories are starting to get a
bit healthier as we get out of the recession, as the economy
recovers and consumers get back to buying products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
