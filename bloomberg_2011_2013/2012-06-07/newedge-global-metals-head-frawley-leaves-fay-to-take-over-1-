Michael Frawley, global head of
metals at Newedge USA LLC in  New York , left the company and John Fay will take over his duties.  Fay is the broker’s global head of fixed income, currency
and commodities, Nicole Wesch, a Newedge spokeswoman in  London ,
said by phone today. As a Category 1 member of the London Metal

on the LME floor along with the likes of Barclays Plc and
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Frawley worked for more than 20 years at Newedge, formerly
known as Calyon Financial and Carr Futures. He served on the
LME’s board until 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
