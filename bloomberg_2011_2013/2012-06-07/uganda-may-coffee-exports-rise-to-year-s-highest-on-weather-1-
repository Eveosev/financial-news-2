Uganda ’s coffee exports in May
climbed to the highest level this season because of good yields
in the nation’s southern region of Masaka and in the southwest,
the country’s Coffee Development Authority said.  Shipments from Africa’s biggest exporter of the crop rose 2
percent to 252,458 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags, from 247,460
bags a year earlier, an official at the authority said today by
e-mail from Kampala, the capital.  The shipments compare with 141,220 bags in April and were
40 percent above a forecast of 180,000 bags, the official said.  Good weather boosted crops in Masaka and the southwest, the
official said.  The European Union,  Sudan , U.S., India,  Morocco ,
 Switzerland  and  South Africa  are some of the major importers of
Uganda’s coffee, according to the authority.  Uganda may export 3.1 million to 3.2 million bags in the
2011-12 season, which started on Oct. 1 and runs through
September, according to the authority. This compares with the
forecast of 2.8 million to 2.9 million given by National Union
of Coffee Agribusinesses and Farm Enterprises on May 8.  Shipments from October through May, the eighth month of the
season, dropped to 1.74 million bags from 1.75 million bags a
year earlier, according to a tally of authority figures by
Bloomberg.  The nation exported 3.15 million bags worth $448.9 million
in 2010-11, according to the authority. The Eastern  Africa  Fine
Coffee Association says Uganda consumes about 3 percent of its
annual crop.  Uganda was Africa’s biggest coffee exporter and the world’s
ninth-largest in the 12 months through last September, according
to the London-based International Coffee Organization. Robusta
beans, used in espressos and instant drinks, account for about
85 percent of Ugandan production, according to the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
