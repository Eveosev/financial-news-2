The European Union will import 45,180
metric tons of sugar at a reduced duty in the last planned
tender this season to ease shortages in the market.  The 27-nation bloc accepted bids to import 40,000 tons of
raw sugar at a minimum duty of 312.60 euros a ton ($393.72) and
5,180 tons of white, or refined, sugar at a minimum duty of 345
euros a ton at the tender today, the European Commission, the
blocâ€™s executive arm, said in an e-mailed statement. The levy on
raw sugar imports is usually 339 euros a ton, while imports of
the white variety incur a duty of 419 euros a ton.  The EU took measures to ease shortages after consumers
complained. Food manufacturing in the region has been disrupted
by a lack of sweetener, according to the Committee of European
Sugar Users, a Brussels-based industry group which represents
companies including  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)   The bloc accepted bids to import 399,014 tons of sugar in
the seven tenders planned for the 2011-12 season, said  Roger Waite , a spokesman for the commission. The bids were for 384,000
tons of raw sugar and 15,014 for the white variety, he said.  White sugar prices in the EU averaged 711 euros a ton in
March, the highest level since at least July 2006, the
commission said in a report published on its website on May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
