A five-month low reached last week by
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  produced a pattern similar to
one at last year’s low, indicating equities may be poised to
rebound.  While the benchmark measure sank June 1 to the lowest level
since January, its 14-day  relative strength index , which
measures the degree to which gains and losses outpace each
other, reached 28.5, staying above a low of 23.2 reached on May
18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last year, the S&P
500 dipped on Oct. 3 to a level not seen since September 2010,
with the RSI holding above its August low. The index then surged
by 29 percent over the next six months.  “This divergence highlights that sellers are losing
momentum and control,” Joshua Dollinger, chief quantitative and
technical strategist at BTIG LLC in  New York , wrote in an e-
mail. The “signals certainly make a compelling case to be
long” over the next six weeks, he said.  The S&P 500 tumbled 9.9 percent from this year’s peak on
April 2 through June 1 amid concern global economic growth is
slowing and  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening. In last week’s
final session, the index fell the most since November, sending
the benchmark gauge below its average price in the past 200 days
for the first time since December, as a Labor Department report
showed the economy added the fewest jobs in a year.  Central Banks  The index has since added 2.9 percent, lifting it back
above the 200-day average, amid speculation global policy makers
will act to stimulate the economy. China cut  interest rates  for
the first time since 2008 today, a day after European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  said officials in the region stand
ready to act and Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President
 Dennis Lockhart  said extending the stimulus program known as
Operation Twist is an option.  Richard Ross , global technical strategist at Auerbach
Grayson & Co., said the retreat may have run its course.  “The false breakdown beneath the 200-day moving average
provided a fitting capstone to the textbook 10 percent
correction, which has set the stage for a sustainable summer
surge,” Ross, based in New York, wrote in a note yesterday.
“The bullish RSI divergence reinforces our belief that prices
should push out through 1,340 and retest 1,400. A fresh new high
above 1,420 must now be considered.”  On Oct. 3, 2011, when the  S&P 500  reached the year’s low of
1,099.23, the RSI fell to 36.2, holding above a low of 16.5
reached on Aug. 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
index then rallied for the next two quarters before the advance
stalled at 1,419.04 on April 2 this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
