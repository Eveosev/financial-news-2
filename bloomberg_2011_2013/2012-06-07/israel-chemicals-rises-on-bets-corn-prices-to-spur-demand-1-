Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)  advanced to the
highest level in three weeks as higher corn prices spurred bets
demand for fertilizers will increase.  Shares of the company that extracts minerals from the Dead
Sea to make fertilizers and potash gained 3.8 percent to 41.30
shekels, the highest since May 16, at the close in Tel Aviv. The
benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  climbed 1.9 percent.  Corn for July delivery advanced as much as 1.2 percent to
$5.935 after surging 3.3 percent yesterday. Chinaâ€™s corn
consumption may increase about 3.4 percent in the 2012-2013
