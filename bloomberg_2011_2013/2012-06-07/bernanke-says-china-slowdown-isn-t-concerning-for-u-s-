Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that “some slowing” in  China’s economy  isn’t
enough to derail the U.S. recovery because oil prices would
decline as Chinese demand ebbs.  “We watch that very carefully,” Bernanke told U.S.
lawmakers on the Joint Economic Committee in Washington today.
“So far, I don’t think the change in Chinese prospects on net
are enough to be concerning for the U.S.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
