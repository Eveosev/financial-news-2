TRUenergy Holdings Pty. hired  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  UBS AG (UBSN)  to manage an initial
public offering that may raise about A$3 billion ($3 billion),
said two people with knowledge of the matter.  The sale of a minority stake in the electricity company may
take place as early as November depending on equity market
valuations, said the people, who declined to be identified as
the details are private.  An IPO of the company, owned by  CLP Holdings Ltd. (2) , would be
Australia’s biggest since 2010. TRUenergy owns the  Yallourn 
coal-fired power station in Victoria state and the Tallawarra
gas-fired plant in New South Wales. In December 2010, it  agreed
to buy  electricity assets from New South Wales, including
distributor EnergyAustralia, for A$2.04 billion to double its
retail customers in  Australia .  Carl Kitchen, a spokesman for TRUenergy in Melbourne,
declined to comment on the selection of banks.  State-owned rail operator  QR National Ltd. (QRN)  raised A$4.63
billion in a share sale in November 2010. U.S. insurer and
mortgage guarantor Genworth Financial Inc. postponed the planned
IPO of its Australian unit in April after “elevated” losses at
the division.  Zurich-based UBS has held the top spot among equity
underwriters in Australia and New Zealand for the past five
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America
was one of the banks involved in the QR National listing in
2010, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
