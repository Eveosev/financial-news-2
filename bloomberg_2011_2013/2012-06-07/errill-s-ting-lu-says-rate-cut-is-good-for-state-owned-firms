Ting Lu, head of Greater  China 
Economics at Merrill Lynch Asia Pacific Ltd., comments in an e-
mail on China’s decision to cut  interest rates  for the first
time since 2008.  “The government is more worried about growth. May and 2Q
data might be below consensus (markets expect 2Q GDP at 7.9% vs
ours at 7.6%). Deposit rates actually up, while minimum lending
rate actually down about 90bp. Good for big SOEs, but impact on
SMEs might be small (depending on liquidity). Negative to banks,
but their profits are too high anyway.”  “Active government reactions support our view of moderate
rebound in 2H.”  “Though the PBOC seemingly give banks more flexibility,
deposit rares will quickly reach the upper limit.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
