Enerkem Inc., the Canadian biofuels
maker that withdrew its initial public offering in April, began
production at a trash-to-ethanol demonstration plant in  Quebec 
and is considering licensing its technology.  The plant in Westbury is expected to validate the company’s
manufacturing process, which will be used at three commercial-
scale facilities under construction in Canada and the U.S.,
Montreal-based Enerkem said today in a statement.  Enerkem converts garbage into gases that are processed into
ethanol and chemicals. The company, which is backed by the trash
hauler  Waste Management Inc. (WM)  and the oil refiner  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) , is seeking other ways to commercialize its technology,
Marie-Helene Labrie, vice president of government affairs and
communications, said today in an interview.  “Our first projects focused on the build, own and operate
model,” Labrie said. Licensing the trash-to-fuel technology may
be “another growth strategy in the future.”  Enerkem’s first commercial plant in  Edmonton , Canada, will
be completed next year. It’s also building facilities in
Pontotoc, Mississippi and Varennes, Quebec, and  each  will be
able to make 38 million liters (10 million gallons) of ethanol a
year.  The company withdrew its registration to raise as much as
$137.8 million on April 26, citing market conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
