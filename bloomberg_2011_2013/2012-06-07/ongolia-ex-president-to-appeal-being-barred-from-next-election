Mongolia’s ex-president Nambaryn Enkhbayar plans to appeal after the government barred him and
his son from contesting this month’s parliamentary election.  Enkhbayar, who heads the Mongolian People’s Revolutionary
Party, and his son Batshugar this week will lodge an appeal with
the country’s election committee and the constitutional court,
Batshugar said today by phone in the capital of  Ulan Bator .
Three calls to the  election committee  offices and an e-mail
seeking comments weren’t answered.  The refusal of Enkhbayar’s candidacy was based on article
27.5.2 of the elections law, which states contenders must show
they have sufficient knowledge, education, and experience to
represent citizens, Batshugar said. Enkhbayar, who attended the
Moscow Institute of Literature and Leeds University in the U.K.,
was Mongolian president from 2005 until 2009 and before that
served as a prime minister.  Enkhbayar remains in the hospital as he recovers from a 10-
day hunger strike he initiated last month to protest his
detention on corruption allegations. The anti-corruption
authority of Mongolia made the arrest after Enkhbayar failed to
show up for questioning over a period of about a year, according
to a May 15 e-mailed statement by the authority.  “They’re doing everything to keep us away from the
elections,” Batshugar said. His own candidacy was refused by
the election committee because he failed to register for
military duty during specified days, Batshugar said, adding that
he couldn’t legally carry out the registration on those days
because he was a suspect in a court case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
