Khaleeji Commercial Bank BSC (KHCB)  said it
would sell its 4 percent stake in Qatari investment bank QInvest
LLC if the Bahraini lender is offered an “appropriate price.”  “It is an asset we would be willing to sell,” Silvan Varghese, acting chief executive officer, said by phone from
Manama, Bahrain today. “We don’t have a management role in
QInvest and like any other investor if we get a good price, we
would sell.”  Khaleeji Commercial shareholder  Gulf Finance House BSC (GFH)  is
seeking buyers for a 4 percent stake in QInvest, The National
newspaper reported today, citing an unidentified person familiar
with the matter.  “So far we don’t have any interest from a buyer,” said
Varghese, who is also the bank’s chief operating officer. “We
are not in a hurry to sell” and any decision would be taken by
the bank’s board, he said.  QInvest said last month it plans to set up a joint
 investment company  with  EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO) , Egypt’s biggest
publicly traded investment bank, in which it will hold a 60
percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
