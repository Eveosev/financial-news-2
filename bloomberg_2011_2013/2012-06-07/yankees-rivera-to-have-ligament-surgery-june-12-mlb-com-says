Mariano Rivera  will have knee surgery
on June 12,  MLB.com reported , citing the  New York  Yankees relief
pitcher.  Rivera, 42, tore the anterior cruciate ligament and
meniscus in his right knee during a pregame warm-up May 3,
ruling him out of the remainder of the Major League Baseball
season.  Surgery was scheduled after doctors decided a blood clot in
his right calf was no longer an issue, the report said.  Rivera, a 12-time All-Star who has a major league record
608 saves, said he’ll be ready to return for the start of next
season, his 19th with the Yankees, MLB.com said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
