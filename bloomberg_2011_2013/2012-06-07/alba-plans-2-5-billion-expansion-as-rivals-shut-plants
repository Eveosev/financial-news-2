Aluminium Bahrain BSC (ALBH)  will spend $2.5
billion by 2015 to increase output, betting prices of the metal
will rebound from a 30 percent slump in the past year that’s
forcing U.S. and European rivals to shutter plants.  “Prices reflect the balance of supply and demand in the
short-term but they will come back to normal,” Chief Executive
Officer Laurent Schmitt said in an interview on June 5.  Alba, as the company is known, plans to invest the money on
adding a potline to produce 400,000 metric tons a year, boosting
total capacity by about 30 percent to 1.3 million tons, Schmitt
said. It will also include power generation for the development.  The producer is seeking to begin a feasibility study before
the end of the year and is in discussions with the Bahraini
government over allocating energy to the development, he said.  Alba is among Middle East producers able to rely on cheap
energy to buck a global trend of shrinking output of the metal.
Emirates Aluminium Co., or Emal, plans to invest $4.6 billion to
expand its capacity to 1.4 million tons a year by 2014, while
Saudi Arabian Mining Co.’s $10.8 billion venture with Alcoa Inc.
includes building a 740,000 ton-a-year smelter by 2013.  Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY) ,  Europe ’s third-largest aluminum producer,
said this week it would close a smelter in  Australia , Alcoa
plans to shut older sites, and United Co. Rusal, the biggest
producer, is studying curbs on smelting in the second half.  “The Gulf isn’t losing its advantage in terms of low-cost
energy” even as U.S. gas prices fall, said Schmitt, who worked
for 15 years at Pechiney SA, a French aluminum producer.  Prices Decline  Aluminum prices have declined 30 percent from a high of
$2,803 a ton on May 3, 2011, to as low as $1,973.75 today in
London trading as world economic growth weakens.  “Prices in the second-quarter will be low,” Schmitt said
in Manama, Bahrain. “$2,500 a ton would reflect the long-term
supply-demand balance and the value of this material.”  Falling U.S. gas prices after the development of shale gas
technology that boosts output have cut energy costs for some
smelters. Natural-gas futures are down 20 percent this year,
even after rising 26 percent from a 10-year low on April 19.  Futures for July declined by 1.1 percent to $2.394 a
million British thermal units by 1:22 p.m. in Dubai.  Schmitt, who says Alba’s production costs put it among the
lowest quartile of aluminum companies, sees U.S. gas prices
rising to $5.5 in 2015. In comparison, Bahrain increased
natural-gas prices to $2.25 this year from $1.50 a unit.  Alba’s funding plan is similar to prior expansions, mostly
using bank loans and export credit agencies, Schmitt said. Half
of its output is used by Bahrain’s downstream industry, he said.  It plans “some sort of upstream integration” in the long-
term by investing in bauxite mines or alumina refining, he said.  Alba contributes 65 percent of non-oil related exports and
10,000 jobs, with  Asia  and Europe each taking 15 percent,  Saudi
Arabia  10 percent and the rest of the  Middle East  the same.  To contact the reporter on this story:
