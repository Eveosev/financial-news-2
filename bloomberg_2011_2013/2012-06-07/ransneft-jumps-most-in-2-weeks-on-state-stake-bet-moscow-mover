OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil-pipeline
operator, surged the most in two weeks after the Economy
Minister said the state will retain its majority stake in the
company.  Transneft’s preferred shares jumped 4.2 percent to 44,341
rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the strongest advance
since May 24. Russia’s 30-stock Micex Index rose 1.8 percent to
1,336.33.  The government plans to reduce its stake in the oil-
pipeline monopoly to 75 percent plus one share by 2016, Economy
Minister Andrei Belousov said at a government meeting in Moscow
today. Former President  Dmitry Medvedev  pledged in June last
year to relinquish government control of some of the biggest
state companies.  “Selling a larger amount of shares would have pressured
the stock price,” Alexander Ivanischev, an analyst at Infina
Investment Co., said by phone. “Now we know that nothing will
change in the ownership structure.”  Transneft’s $1.1 billion of Eurobonds due 2018 rose,
cutting the yield 25 basis points to 4.369 percent. The yield
headed for the biggest daily fall since Feb. 28.  The government will reduce its stake in high-voltage
transmission monopoly Federal Grid Co. by the same date,
Belousov said.  Russia will sell its entire stakes in OAO Rosneft, the
country’s biggest oil company, OAO RusHydro, its biggest
renewable energy producer, power utility OAO Inter RAO UES and
overseas crude producer OAO Zarubezhneft, according to Belousov.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
