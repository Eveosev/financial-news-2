Russia is ready to step up economic
assistance to Afghanistan, President  Vladimir Putin  said during
talks with his Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai in Beijing.  “We are talking about reconstructing what was built during
the time of the  Soviet Union  and new projects,” Putin said
today at the meeting, according to a pool report from the Itar-
Tass news service.  Putin also promised to continue providing military
assistance. Russia is training Afghan technicians to service 21
Russian-made Mi-17 transport helicopters that the U.S. has
ordered for Afghanistan’s armed forces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
