A lawmaker for Argentina’s ruling
party said he will present a bill today to require new contracts
to be denominated in pesos as the government attempts to deter
the use of dollars.  “All those accords or contracts aimed to change the
ownership of goods will only be valid if they are done in the
legal national currency,” Edgardo Depetri said in an e-mailed
statement.  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  has tightened
controls on the foreign exchange market since being re-elected
in October in a bid to stem a record capital outflow that was
draining  central bank reserves . Fernandez yesterday said
Argentines should trust in the local currency and pledged to
convert her dollar-denominated savings into pesos, and asked
officials to follow her example.  Real estate and some rental contracts are often denominated
in dollars in Argentina.  “What we want is to recover the culture of our own
currency as a unit of value and exchange tool to pay obligations
within our country,” Depetri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
