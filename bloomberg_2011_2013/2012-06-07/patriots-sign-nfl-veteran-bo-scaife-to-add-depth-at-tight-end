The  New England Patriots  signed Bo Scaife, adding depth at tight end behind Rob Gronkowski and
 Aaron Hernandez .  The team doesn’t disclose financial terms. A call left for
Scaife’s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, wasn’t immediately returned.  Scaife , 31, a sixth-round draft pick out of the University
of Texas in 2005, spent six National Football League seasons
with the Tennessee Titans. His most productive year was 2008,
when he caught 58 passes for 561 yards and two touchdowns. The
Titans placed the franchise tag on him the following season.  Scaife caught 36 passes for 318 yards and four touchdowns
in 2010 and was allowed to enter free agency. The 6-foot-3, 249-
pound tight signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the
 Cincinnati Bengals  in 2011, but injured his neck during
preseason and was placed on injured reserve.  He will compete with Daniel Fells for the Patriots’ No. 3
tight end spot, according to NFL.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
