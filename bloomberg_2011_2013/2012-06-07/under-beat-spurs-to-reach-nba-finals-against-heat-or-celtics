The Oklahoma City Thunder rallied
from an 18-point second-quarter deficit to beat the  San Antonio 
Spurs 107-99 and advance to the National Basketball Association
Finals, where theyâ€™ll play the Miami Heat or the  Boston Celtics .  The Thunder, who lost the first two games of the series in
San Antonio, won the best-of-seven Western Conference finals by
four games to two.  The Celtics can become the Eastern Conference champion with
a home win tomorrow. Should the Heat win, a decisive seventh
game will be played June 9 in Miami.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
