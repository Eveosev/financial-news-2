Rains in the past month in Ukraine
were “gold” for farmers after dry weather in April left crops
at risk for reduced yields, said Sergey Feofilov, general
director at researcher UkrAgroConsult  Ukraine’s corn production may total 22 million to 23
million metric tons in the 2012-13 marketing year, Feofilov said
today in an interview at the International Grains Council’s
annual conference in  London . Wheat output may be about 14
million tons. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates
Ukraine’s corn production at 24 million tons and its wheat
harvest at 13 million.  “The weather for corn and sunflowers has been almost ideal
recently,” Feofilov said. “We had two waves of rain all over
Ukraine. That was gold for farmers last month. In late April,
the situation was almost critical.”  About 2 million hectares (4.9 million acres) of winter
wheat and rapeseed suffered from winter kill after a cold snap
in February, Feofilov said. Much of that land was replanted with
corn and sunflowers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
