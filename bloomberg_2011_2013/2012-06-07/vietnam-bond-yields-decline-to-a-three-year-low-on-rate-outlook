Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose for a
sixth day, pushing yields to a three-year low, on speculation
the central bank will cut borrowing costs further as inflation
slows. The dong was steady.  The State Bank of Vietnam will “steer  interest rates  on a
declining path,” Deputy Governor Le Minh Hung said in a
statement distributed at a conference in the central Vietnamese
town of Dong Ha on June 4. The monetary authority lowered
benchmark rates by a total 300 basis points in the last three
months. Annual  inflation  was 8.34 percent in May, the least
since August 2010, according to government data.  “Banks have surplus cash and think interest rates will
fall, so they’ve started buying bonds,” said Nguyen Duy Phong,
a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital Securities Co.  Five-year bond yields dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 9.47 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level
since June 30, 2009. The yield fell 14 basis points this week.  The dong traded at 21,001 per dollar as of 4:28 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, unchanged from
yesterday. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
