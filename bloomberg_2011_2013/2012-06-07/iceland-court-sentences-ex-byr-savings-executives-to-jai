Byr Savings Bank  former Chairman Jon
Thorsteinn Jonsson and the lender’s ex-Chief Executive Officer
Ragnar Zophonias Gudjonsson were today found guilty of fraud and
sentenced to four and half years in prison by Iceland’s  Supreme
Court .  The  court  found that the two former executives had used
their positions at Byr to grant an 800-million kronur ($6.2
million) loan to Exeter Holdings ehf in 2008 as Iceland’s
financial system was on the brink of collapse.  Proceeds of the loan were used by Exeter to buy Jonsson’s
and Gudjonsson’s shares in Byr. Exeter guaranteed the loan by
putting the Byr shares up as collateral.  “In deciding the punishment” the Supreme Court took
account of the fact that the “magnitude of the offences was
significant,” according to the  ruling  posted on the Reykjavik-
based court’s website. Jonsson’s action “relieved him from
personal guarantees on loans” and Gudjonsson’s “infraction was
committed under the auspices of his mandate” as Byr’s chief
executive officer, according to the ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
