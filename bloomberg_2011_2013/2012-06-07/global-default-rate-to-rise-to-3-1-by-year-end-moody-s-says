The global speculative-grade
corporate default rate will rise to 3.1 percent by the end of
2012 before easing back to 3 percent a year from now, according
to Moody’s Investors Service.  These rates are relatively low compared with the historical
average of 4.8 percent since 1983, Moody’s said in a report.  The global rate rose to 2.7 percent in May, from 2.6
percent the month before, according to the report. A total of 31
Moody’s-rated corporate debt issuers defaulted this year, five
of them last month.  In the U.S., the default rate rose to 3.1 percent from 3
percent at the end of the previous month, while in  Europe  the
rate fell to 2.7 percent from 2.8 percent. A year ago, the U.S.
rate was 2.7 percent and in Europe it was 2.1 percent, Moody’s
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
