The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.3 percent to 591.2 at 5:02 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials fell 0.2
percent to 1,435.778.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the highest price in four days in New York
as policy makers in the U.S. and  Europe  indicated they may take
steps to boost their economies and  Iran  signaled it will take a
hard line in nuclear talks.  Futures were little changed after rising as much as 0.9
percent. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said the
U.S. remains vulnerable to setbacks that may warrant additional
monetary stimulus, while European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said officials are ready to act as the euro area’s
outlook worsens. Oil may rebound on policy measures, according
to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Iran pulled back from an agreement
on nuclear inspections before talks this month.  Oil for July delivery was at $84.80 a barrel, down 24
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 8:50 a.m. London time. The contract yesterday rose 73 cents
to $85.02, the highest close since May 31. Prices are 14 percent
lower this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures rose after yesterday’s decline on
speculation hot weather forecast for the eastern U.S. next week
would be followed by below-normal temperatures, crimping fuel
demand from electricity generators to run air conditioners.  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore gasoil swaps for July rose $1.33, or 1.2 percent,
to $113.60 a barrel. The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude fell
10 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $15.82 a barrel. Jet fuel traded at
a premium of 75 cents a barrel to gasoil. This spread, also
known as the regrade, has narrowed 38 percent from May 31,
signaling it is less profitable to make  aviation fuel  compared
with a week earlier.  Naphtha swaps for July rose $11, or 1.4 percent, to $801.25
a ton, PVM data showed. Prices are at the highest since May 31.
Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
jumped $9.72 to $41.75 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Singapore fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, a measure of
refining losses from the fuel, shrank 42 cents to $1.56 a barrel
at 11:10 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a broker.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold gained on speculation Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  will signal that more stimulus is needed, weakening the
dollar and increasing demand for alternative investments.  Immediate-delivery gold rose as much as 0.4 percent to
$1,626.25 an ounce before trading at $1,621.73 by 2:18 p.m. in
Singapore. August-delivery bullion fell for the first day in
three on the Comex in  New York , dropping as much as 0.9 percent
to $1,618.80 an ounce.  It was last at $1,623, after reaching a one-month high of
$1,642.40 yesterday. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the
biggest exchange-traded product backed by bullion, increased to
1,274.79 metric tons yesterday, the largest amount since May 21,
the company’s website showed.  BASE METALS  Copper gained for a second day as industrial metals
advanced on speculation policy makers will take steps to revive
the slowing global economy.  Three-month copper climbed as much as 0.9 percent to
$7,473.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, before
trading at $7,442.25 at 1:01 p.m. Shanghai time. The contract
gained as much as 1.6 percent yesterday, the most since May 21.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn for July delivery was little changed at $5.865 a
bushel, after climbing as much as 0.7 percent. Futures jumped
3.3 percent yesterday. Wheat for July fell 0.4 percent to $6.215
a bushel after gaining 1.8 percent yesterday.  U.S. corn, soybean and wheat inventories before this year’s
harvests may be less than the government forecast last month as
smaller world crops boost demand for American supplies,
according to a Bloomberg survey. The USDA is scheduled to update
its estimates on June 12 at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Soybeans advanced for a fourth-day, the longest winning
streak since April, as U.S. exporters sold more oilseeds to
 China  and on signs policy makers around the world may take steps
to revive the slowing economy.  November-delivery soybeans gained as much as 0.8 percent to
$13.095 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at
$13.0525 at 3:53 p.m. Singapore time. The most-active contract
is heading for a 3.8 percent gain this week.  Rubber rebounded from the lowest level since November 2009
on optimism that demand may increase as global policy makers
take steps to boost economic growth.  The November-delivery contract gained as much as 4.2
percent, the biggest climb since Jan. 17, to 251 yen a kilogram
($3,165 a metric ton) before settling at 243.4 yen on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. Futures have tumbled 7.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
