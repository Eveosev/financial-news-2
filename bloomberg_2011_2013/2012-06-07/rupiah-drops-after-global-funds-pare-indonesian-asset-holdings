Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened after
international investors cut holdings of the nation’s assets,
boosting demand for dollars to repatriate money.  Global funds  reduced  ownership of local government debt by
6.87 trillion rupiah ($728 million) in the past month, according
to data from the Ministry of Finance. The rupiah has slumped 2.9
percent this quarter, prompting the central bank to say this
week it may unveil further measures to ease volatility after
pledging last month that it will start offering term deposits in
the U.S. currency.  “Investors are selling Indonesia’s assets and repatriating
funds, weighing on the rupiah,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief
trader on the Asian and emerging-markets team at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo . “On top of that, there has been
strong corporate demand for the dollar. There is a possibility
the  Bank Indonesia  will introduce some regulations to help halt
declines in the rupiah.”  The rupiah slumped 1.5 percent to 9,438 per dollar as of
3:04 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency reached 9,643 on May 31, the
weakest level since October 2009. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped
125 basis points, or 1.25 percentage point, to 12.75 percent.  Global investors sold $157 million more of Indonesia’s
equities than they bought this month through yesterday, exchange
data show.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.48
percent, according to the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
