Vitro SAB (VITROA)  is set to learn next week
whether it can enforce its Mexican bankruptcy plan in the U.S.
after the glassmaker clashed with bondholders in court over the
plan.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin DeWayne Hale in Dallas said in
court yesterday that he plans to rule on Vitro’s enforcement
motion next week, probably by June 13.  Vitro, which has won approval for the bankruptcy plan in
Mexico, is seeking an order from Hale enforcing the
restructuring and stopping litigation by bondholders who have
been fighting the plan in the U.S. and Mexico in an effort to
collect on $1.2 billion in defaulted bonds.  Andrew Leblanc, an attorney for Vitro, said in his closing
argument yesterday that the Mexican approval is “worthy of
respect” in the U.S. and should be enforced.  “Vitro hangs in the balance,” he said.  The case is in re Vitro SAB, 11-33335, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
