The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars rose, reversing two days of declines, according to a
money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 52 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 12:40 p.m. in
London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s from
minus 50 basis points yesterday and compares with minus 59 on
June 4, which was the most expensive in three months.  The one-year basis swap declined to 58 basis points below
Euribor, from minus 60 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- climbed to 35 basis points from 32.5.  The Euribor/OIS spread held at 38 basis points. The measure
has been little changed for the past two months. The three-month
Euribor benchmark rate was unchanged at 0.663 percent today,
according to the European Banking Federation.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 785 billion euros ($988
billion) from 787 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
