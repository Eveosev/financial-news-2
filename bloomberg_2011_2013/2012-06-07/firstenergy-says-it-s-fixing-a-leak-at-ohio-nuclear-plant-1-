(Corrects comment from NRC in last paragraph of story
published June 7 on whether the leak must be reported.)  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  is repairing a leak
discovered June 6 as it restarted Davis-Besse nuclear station in
 Ohio  following a refueling outage, a company spokeswoman said.  FirstEnergy can’t say for competitive reasons when it
expects to complete the repair to the reactor’s coolant system
or when the 913-megawatt unit will come online, Jennifer Young,
a spokeswoman for the Akron, Ohio-based company said in a
telephone phone interview today.  The amount of radioactive water that sprayed through the
pinhole-sized leak was “relatively small” and no radiation was
discharged from the plant, Young said.  Because the leak was from a pressure boundary in a system
that contains the reactor and radioactive coolant, the company
was required to report the incident to the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.  “When the leak was identified as coming from a pressure
boundary, the plant was required to report it to the NRC, shut
the plant down and fix it,” Viktoria Mitlyng, a spokeswoman for
the agency in Lisle,  Illinois , said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
