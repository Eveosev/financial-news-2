(Corrects spelling of company name in headline.)  China ’s imports of corn, soybeans and
other feed grain won’t be significantly slowed as expansion in
the world’s second-biggest economy moderates, Cargill Inc. Chief
Risk Officer Emery Koenig said.  “The outlook remains positive for soybeans and feed
grain” imports including corn, Koenig said in an interview in
Beijing today where he’s attending a conference. Growing wealth
in China is fueling increased consumption of meat, driving
demand for  animal feed  and establishing a “very positive trend
of growth,” he said.  Chinese economic  growth slowed  in the first quarter to the
weakest since 2009 as the government’s campaign to rein in
inflation and  home prices  eroded domestic consumption and the
 European debt crisis  curbed exports. Demand for grains hasn’t
slowed because of increased industrial use and livestock
consumption, with China National Grain & Oils Information Center
estimating corn imports may more than triple this year.  “China will be an increasing corn importer,” Koenig said.
Demand for China and government mandates for biofuels are
supporting global agricultural commodity prices, he said.  Increased industrial and livestock consumption of corn in
China has lifted prices in the past two years even as output
gained, diminishing the nation’s self-sufficiency, Agriculture
Minister Han Changfu said last month. Production growth is
limited by low yields, lack of water and technology, which can
be improved with policy and technological support, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
