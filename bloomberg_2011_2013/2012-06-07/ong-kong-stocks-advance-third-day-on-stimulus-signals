Hong Kong   stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index capping its biggest three-day gain since
February, amid optimism policy makers from the U.S., China and
Europe will take steps to stem a global economic slowdown.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that counts Europe as its
biggest market, climbed 1.3 percent.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier
to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., increased 2.1 percent. China
Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s second-largest lender,
climbed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government signaled it
will delay tighter bank capital rules.  The Hang Seng Index advanced 0.9 percent to 18,678.29 at
the close, with almost twice as many stocks rising as falling in
the 49-member gauge. The index gained 2.7 percent in three days,
the steepest such advance since Feb. 17. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland stocks gained 0.4 percent to
9,473.46.  “There may be fatigue in being bearish,” said  Yoji
Takeda , who oversees $1.1 billion at RBC Investment Management
(Asia) Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Stocks look very cheap because
they’ve been sold down. There are signs that recent bad news is
already priced into the market” and increasing hope for more
measures from the European governments and easing from China.  Hong Kong’s  benchmark index  tumbled 15 percent through
yesterday from this year’s high on Feb. 29 amid slowing growth
in the U.S. and China and a deepening crisis in Europe. Shares
on the Hang Seng Index traded at 9.5 times estimated earnings on
average yesterday, compared with 12.6 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 10 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Standing Ready  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said officials
stand ready to act as the euro region’s growth outlook worsens.
Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said the  U.S. economy 
“remains vulnerable to setbacks” and may warrant additional
monetary stimulus.  Dennis Lockhart , president of the Fed’s
Atlanta bank, said extending Operation Twist, a policy of buying
longer-term bonds, is an “option on the table.”  Esprit gained 1.3 percent to HK$12.68.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) ,
which operates a port in Greece, advanced 3.6 percent to
HK$9.32. Li & Fung climbed 2.1 percent to HK$14.74 and Yue Yuen
Industrial Holdings Ltd., which makes shoes for Nike Inc., rose
5.5 percent to HK$24.  Chinese lenders advanced on speculation the government will
delay tighter lending controls. New draft rules seek to set
“reasonable” schedules for banks to meet capital targets to
help “maintain appropriate credit growth,” the government said
on its website yesterday, without giving a deadline for
compliance. The China Banking Regulatory Commission in August
said the standards would start Jan. 1, 2012.  Banks Rise  China Construction Bank rose 0.7 percent to HK$5.50.
Agricultural Bank rose as much as 2.6 percent to HK$3.22.  Wharf Holdings Ltd., a property developer, rose 4.9 percent
to HK$43.05 after saying the floor area of the Ocean Terminal
site that it leases from the Hong Kong government has increased.  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  futures expiring this month climbed 0.1
percent to 18,520. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  sank 1.3 percent to
26.96, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.7 percent in
the benchmark index during the next 30 days.  “The Chinese will take action to stimulate the economy and
the Americans will similarly respond with an extension of
Operation Twist or more quantitative easing,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1 billion at Platypus Asset
Management Ltd. in Sydney. “For a sustained rally, we need a
period of stability where we’re not in a firefighting crisis
mode.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
