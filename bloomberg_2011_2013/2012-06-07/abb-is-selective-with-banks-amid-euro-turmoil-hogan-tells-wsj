ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  is avoiding some European
banks to make sure it does not get “caught” by euro turmoil,
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer Joe Hogan.  “There are hot-spots and it is fair to say we are
selective where we are putting our money,” the newspaper quoted
Hogan as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
