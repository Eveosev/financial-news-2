Interest rate and credit index swaps
will be the first derivatives to face clearing requirements this
year under the Dodd-Frank Act, said U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission chairman  Gary Gensler .  The agency’s staff is preparing recommendations to require
clearing of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as well as
indexes of North American investment grade and high-yield credit
swaps, Gensler said in a speech prepared for the Sandler O’Neill
Global Exchange and Brokerage  Conference  in  New York .  Dodd-Frank, the 2010 financial-regulation overhaul, intends
for most swaps to be guaranteed by clearinghouses that seek to
reduce risk in trades by standing between buyers and sellers.
Largely unregulated swaps helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis.  “Swaps market reform also benefits markets by increasing
the use of central clearing, which promotes the financial
integrity of markets and lowers the risks of the highly
interconnected financial system,” he said in the speech.  The CFTC’s clearing determinations will probably also
include basis swaps and forward rate agreements. Overnight index
swaps in U.S. dollars, Euros, British pounds and Japanese yen
will probably also face the clearing determination, Gensler
said.  Some European iTraxx, high volatility and crossover
iTraxx indexes will probably also face the clearing requirement,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
