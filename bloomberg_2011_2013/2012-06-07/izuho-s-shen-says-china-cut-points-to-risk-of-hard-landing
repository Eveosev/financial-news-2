Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist
for Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. comments on China’s decision to
cut  interest rates  for the first time since 2008.  “The interest rate cut, which is the first time since 2008
and does not fall in a weekend or holiday as usual, was a
surprise to us as well as the market.”  “In my view, it likely reflects that the May macroeconomic
indicators, to be released on 9 and 10 May, will be very weak,
and point to increasing risk for hard-landing. Top policy makers
should have already seen the data, and appeared to be very
concerned.”  “The interest rate cut was not asymmetric as market
expected, reflecting that underlying inflationary pressure has
been significantly reduced amid sub-potential growth. In May,
inflation rate will likely drop to below 3.25%YoY, reducing the
concern for negative real interest rate, which drive potential
depositors away from the banking system to invest in the asset
markets.”  “The interest rate cut today stands for the beginning for
more decisive easing from the government, in order to support
the economy at the brink of  hard-landing  in Q2. We expect that
more easing will be announced in the coming weeks, especially
policies supportive of infrastructure investment and housing
policy easing.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
