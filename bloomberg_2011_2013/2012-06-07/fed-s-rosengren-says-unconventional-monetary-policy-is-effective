Unconventional monetary policy tools
are helpful in restoring growth to the economy, said  Eric Rosengren , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  Though there are signs the U.S. housing market continues to

Finance in Copenhagen today. Monetary policy should look to the
housing market, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
