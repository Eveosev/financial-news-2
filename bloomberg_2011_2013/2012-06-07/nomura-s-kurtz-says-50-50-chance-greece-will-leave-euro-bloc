Michael Kurtz , Hong Kong-based head
of global equity strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s
largest brokerage, comments on Europe’s debt crisis. He spoke in
an interview at an equity forum in Singapore.  On likelihood of Greece leaving the euro:  “We think that there is a very large chance that the Greek
elections will produce a government that is committed to
rejecting Greece’s obligations to its international creditors
and if that happens, it will probably be forced out” of the
euro bloc.  “We accept that possibility” that Greece will exit.
“Let’s call it a 50/50 chance.”  On the  European Central Bank :  “The issue really is: ‘Will the ECB act decisively if it
does happen?’”  “European leadership has had a long time now since the
initial elections on May 6 to contemplate this outcome and to
prepare for the possibility of that outcome.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
