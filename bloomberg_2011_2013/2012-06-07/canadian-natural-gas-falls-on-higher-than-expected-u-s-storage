Canadian natural gas fell to the
lowest price in more than a month after a U.S. government report
showed storage levels increased more than expected last week.  July gas in  Alberta  declined 8.9 percent following the
Energy Department report that  U.S. stockpiles  expanded by 62
billion cubic feet to 2.877 trillion.  Analyst estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg forecast an increase of 58 billion and a survey of
Bloomberg users predicted a gain of 56 billion. The five-year
average stockpile rise for the week is 99 billion cubic feet.  “We put a little bit more into storage than people
anticipated,”  Gordon Elliott , a risk management specialist at
Intl FC Stone LLC in St. Louis Park,  Minnesota , said in a
telephone interview. “That’s a killer in itself, but when you
have so much stocks to begin with, and the short-covering rally
we’ve had has passed and the trend has turned.”  Alberta gas for July delivery declined 16.75 cents to
C$1.72 a gigajoule ($1.59 per million British thermal units),
the lowest level since May 2, as of 3:10 p.m. New York time. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system. NGX gas
is down 35 percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 14.7 cents to settle at $2.274 per million Btu.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
dropped 8.05 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $2.3688 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line
that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas declined 10.74 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.0615 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices fell 11.62 cents, or 5.1 percent, to
$2.173.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.8 billion cubic
feet at 3 p.m.  New York  time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.04 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.97 billion cubic feet.  There was a shortage of available capacity on TransCanada’s
British Columbia system at  Kingsgate  of 43 million cubic feet.
The system was forecast to carry 2.03 billion cubic feet today,
or 2.2 percent more than its normal capacity of 1.98 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.77
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
