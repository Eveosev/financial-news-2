China ’s housing market will “gain
the most” from the government’s decision to cut  interest rates 
for the first time since 2008, Centaline Property Agency Ltd.
said in a report today.  “The rate cut does not mean the government is trying to
save the housing market, but the housing market will definitely
gain the most from the move,” the property broker said. “The
hardest time for property developers is over.”  More buyers may also enter the market as a result of the
central bank’s announcement that benchmark lending and deposit
rates will be reduced by 0.25 percentage points from tomorrow,
Centaline said. The rate cut may be seen by potential buyers as
a “turn around in policy and the wait-and-see attitude will
fizzle away,” the agency said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
