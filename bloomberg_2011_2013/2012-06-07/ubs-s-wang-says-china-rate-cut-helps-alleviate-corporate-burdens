Wang Tao, chief China economist for
 UBS AG (UBSN) , comments on China’s decision to cut interest rates for
the first time since 2008.  “May data are likely to be pretty bad, particularly
industrial production may be still below 10 percent year-on-
year.”  The interest rate cut “should help alleviate the interest
burdens of corporate and government sectors.  Mortgage rates  will
be adjusted lower accordingly, which should help home buyers.”  “The symmetric rate cut leaves room for asymmetric moves.
In an unprecedented move, the PBOC allowed banks to pay
depositors a higher rate than the official benchmark rate. Given
that banks have been fighting to attract deposits, the move is
likely going to result in a higher not lower deposit rate.
Keeping the deposit rate at a higher level would help banks to
retain deposits. This is also a milestone for interest rate
liberalization.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
