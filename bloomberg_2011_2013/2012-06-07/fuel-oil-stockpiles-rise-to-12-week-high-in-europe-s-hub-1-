Fuel oil  stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, increased to a 12-week high after a supertanker leaving for
Singapore was delayed, according to PJK International BV.  Fuel oil  inventories climbed 43 percent to 1.011 million
metric tons in the week to today, according to data by PJK, a
researcher in the Netherlands. That’s the most since March 15.
Two very large crude carriers will depart on June 8 and June 13
for Singapore, PJK said. Supplies arrived from France,  Russia 
and the U.S.  The delayed departure of one of the tankers led to the
higher stockpiles, Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said by phone
today from Breda where the company is based. The level should
drop next week, he said.  Gasoil inventories increased 2 percent to 2.33 million
tons, the highest since May 10, on supplies from  Norway , Russia
and the U.S., PJK data shows. Some cargoes of the fuel, which
includes heating oil and diesel, left for  Argentina , it shows.  Gasoline stockpiles rose 5.4 percent to 724,000 tons on
cargoes from Finland, France, Russia and the U.K.  Naphtha inventories gained 6.9 percent to 140,000 tons on
supplies from Russia and  Spain , PJK data shows. That’s the
highest since Dec. 31, 2008.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha, fuel oil and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
