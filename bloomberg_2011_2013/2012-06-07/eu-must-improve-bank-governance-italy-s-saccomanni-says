The European Union must step up
efforts to improve banking governance as it seeks closer
economic union to tackle the sovereign-debt crisis, Bank of
Italy Director General Fabrizio Saccomanni said.  With European lenders and sovereigns caught up in a
“vicious circle,” policy makers must make a “total
commitment” to introduce bank-deposit guarantees, a centralized
system of bank supervision and a crisis-resolution mechanism for
distressed lenders, Saccomanni said in a speech today in
Palermo, Sicily.  Italian banks also need to take steps to boost
profitability by cutting costs and increasing efficiency,
Saccomanni said.  Banks need to “rationalize” their branches
and units to avoid overlap, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
