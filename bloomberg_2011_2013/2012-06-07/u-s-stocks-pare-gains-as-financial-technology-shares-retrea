U.S. stocks pared gains as financial
and technology shares erased an earlier rally, snuffing out most
of a morning advance triggered by  China ’s first interest rate
cut since 2008.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,315.8 as of 3:43 p.m. in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
