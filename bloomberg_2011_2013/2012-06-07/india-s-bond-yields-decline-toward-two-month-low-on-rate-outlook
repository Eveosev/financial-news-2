India ’s benchmark bonds rose, pushing
yields toward a more than two-month low, on speculation the
central bank will reduce borrowing  costs  for a second time this
year to arrest an economic slowdown.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has more room to cut  interest
rates  after economic growth slowed and  oil prices  dropped,
Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said this week. Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh yesterday pledged measures to revive economic
 growth , echoing similar statements from global policy makers.
China cut rates today for the first time since 2008.  “Monetary easing is definitely on the cards,” said
Pradeep Madhav, managing director at Mumbai-based STCI Primary
Dealer Ltd. “Yields may soften, given the weak growth
outlook.”  The yield on the government’s 8.79 percent bonds due
November 2021 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 8.35 percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The rate touched 8.34 percent on June 5, the
lowest level since March 14.  STCI’s Madhav predicted the central bank will cut the
repurchase rate and banks’ cash reserve ratio by 25 basis points
each at its next policy review on June 18.  The monetary authority last cut the repo rate by 50 basis
points to 8 percent in April after raising it 13 times between
March 2010 and October 2011. The reserve  ratio  has been cut by
125 basis points this year to 4.75 percent.  India’s economy  expanded 5.3 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, the least in nine years, according to
official data published last week. Brent crude oil has dropped
19 percent to $101.56 per barrel since March. India imports
about 80 percent of its oil.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell four basis
points to 7.65 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
