Metalloinvest (METIN) , the Russian iron-ore
producer controlled by billionaire  Alisher Usmanov , may shortly
buy the 20 percent of its stock held by VTB Group, according to
Moody’s Investors Service.  Metalloinvest could acquire the stake from VTB,  Russia ’s
second-biggest lender, for about $2.5 billion in cash, Moody’s
analysts Denis Perevezentsev and Steven Oman said in a report.  “The pace of Metalloinvest’s cash accumulation thus far in
2012 would appear to point to such a pending transaction,”
Moody’s said.  The iron-ore producer, which had $1.2 billion in cash at
the end of 2011, drew down $916 million of revolving bank debt
in January and issued $850 million of ruble bonds in March,
Moody’s said. Metalloinvest got $540 million from the sale of
its railroad transportation unit to  Globaltrans Investment Plc. (GLTR)   Usmanov, Russia’s richest man, said April 27 that the
company may study buying back VTB’s stake and is in preliminary
talks with the bank.  Metalloinvest and VTB declined to comment when contacted by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
