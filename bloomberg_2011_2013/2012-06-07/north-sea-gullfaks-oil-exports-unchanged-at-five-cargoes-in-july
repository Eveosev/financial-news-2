Exports of North Sea Gullfaks crude
for July will be unchanged from this month at five cargoes of
800,000 barrels each, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Loadings of Statfjord will decline to three cargoes of
855,000 barrels each, according to a separate schedule. Exports
for June were revised to five consignments, after one lot was
added to the program.  Aasgard exports for July will comprise eight 855,000-barrel
cargoes, unchanged from June, a plan showed.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil and gas producer,
operates the three fields. Loading programs are monthly
schedules of crude shipments compiled by field operators to
allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply and trading
activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
