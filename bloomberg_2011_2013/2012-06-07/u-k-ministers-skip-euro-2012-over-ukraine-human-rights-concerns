U.K. ministers will not attend the
opening stages of the Euro 2012 soccer championship due to
concerns about human rights in Ukraine.  The European Union has called for opposition leader  Yulia Tymoshenko  to be freed from prison, after she was jailed for
seven years over a gas accord she signed with Russia in 2009,
when she was premier. EU commissioners and Swedish and Dutch
officials have also said they’ll boycott the tournament, which
is being co-hosted with  Poland .  “The government fully supports England’s participation in
Euro 2012,” the British Foreign Office said in an e-mailed
statement today. “No ministers will be attending group games at
Euro 2012. We are keeping attendance at later stages of the
tournament under review in the light of ministers’ busy
schedules ahead of the Olympics and widespread concerns about
selective justice and the rule of law in Ukraine.”  England  plays all its three group matches in the
tournament, which starts tomorrow, in Ukraine. The first game is
against France in Donetsk on June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
