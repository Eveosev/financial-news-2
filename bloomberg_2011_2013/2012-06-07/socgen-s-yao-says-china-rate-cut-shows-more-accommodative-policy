Yao Wei, an economist at  Societe
Generale SA (GLE) , comments on  China ’s decision to cut interest rates
for the first time since 2008.  “This move comes before the weekend release of China’s May
data, which might imply negative data surprises.”  “The further liberalization is more significant than the
cut itself. Given the new floating band, deposit rates may
actually rise to 3.575 percent. The lending rate can move to as
low as 5 percent.”  “It is a very strong policy signal in two-fold. One,
monetary policy definitely turning more accommodative to restore
market confidence. Two, Beijing is not forgetting structural
reforms.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
