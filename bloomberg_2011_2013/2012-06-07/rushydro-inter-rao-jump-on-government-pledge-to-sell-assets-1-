OAO RusHydro and OAO Inter RAO UES
rose after  Russia ’s Economy Minister Andrei Belousov said the
state will sell its entire stake in the power utilities by 2016.  RusHydro added 4.7 percent to 85.03 kopeks, the highest
since May 16, in Moscow. Its American depositary receipts rose
3.7 percent to $2.55 in  New York , the fourth-biggest gainer on
the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies traded
in the U.S. The gauge rose 2 percent to 85.18. Inter RAO climbed
1 percent to 2.8 kopeks.  “Private ownership frequently proves itself more
effective, this can be traced to the Russian power sector as a
whole,” Dmitry Bulgakov, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in
Moscow, said by phone. “It creates more incentives for value
creation and cost-cutting.”  The government also plans to reduce its stake in Federal
Grid Co., Russia’s monopoly for high-voltage power transmission
lines, to 75 percent and one share by 2016. Federal Grid
advanced 2 percent to 19.33 kopeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
