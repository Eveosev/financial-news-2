German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
she supports a two-speed European Union, with the faster group
seeking deeper integration such as a fiscal union to complement
monetary union.  “We need more  Europe , we need not only a monetary union,
but we also need a so-called fiscal union, in other words more
joint budget policy,” Merkel said in an interview on ARD German
public television broadcast today. “And we need most of all a
political union, that means we need to gradually give
competencies to Europe and give Europe control.”  Europe is already moving at different speeds, Merkel said,
citing the Schengen agreement that abolished border controls
between some European countries and the monetary union that
excludes the U.K. and  Denmark .  “This will be intensified,” she said. “Those in a
monetary union will have to move closer together. We have to be
open. We always have to make it possible for everyone” to join,
“but we mustn’t stop because one or the other don’t want to
come along just yet.”  Merkel said EU leaders at a meeting later this month will
discuss a plan to transform the EU into a political union.
Still, a breakthrough can’t be achieved at just one summit, she
said.  Deficit reductions and steps to boost economic growth are
“two sides of the same coin,” Merkel also said. While there
can’t be growth without sound public finances, EU countries must
also improve their competitiveness to such an extent that they
can sell their products in global markets, Merkel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
