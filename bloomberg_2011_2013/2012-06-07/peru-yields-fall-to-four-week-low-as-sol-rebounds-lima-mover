Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields to a four-week low, as gains in the best-performing
currency in  emerging markets  in the past year spur demand for
local securities.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.11 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest yield since May 9. The price
rose 0.38 centimo to 117.96 centimos per sol.  “The currency is fundamental for investors making
decisions about local bonds,” said Manuel Aldave, the head of
investments at Banco Internacional del Peru in Lima. “If you’re
going to have a stable currency, it makes local paper much more
attractive. If it’s going to appreciate, that’s even better.”  Peru’s central bank sold $676 million in the spot currency
market last month to limit declines in the sol as  Europe ’s
financial turmoil threatened to engulf Spain. The currency
strengthened today as China, Peru’s top trading partner, cut
interest rates to revive its slowing economy and as yields on
Spanish bonds gained after a debt sale.  The sol rose 0.3 percent to 2.678 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.685 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. Its
4 percent appreciation in the past year is the strongest among
25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The central bank will probably keep its benchmark  interest
rate  unchanged at 4.25 percent for a 13th month today, according
to all 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank will
announce its decision at about 6 p.m. in  Lima .  To contact the reporter on this story:
