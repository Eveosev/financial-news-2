Callum Henderson, global head of
currency research at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore,
comments on  China ’s decision to cut  interest rate  for the first
time since 2008.  “This is a major move and in line with the message from
the State Council that a more pro-growth strategy will be the
focus.  ‘‘Coming at such a key time ahead of Bernanke’s testimony,
the G20 and the FOMC, this is an important message that China is
supporting domestic growth and doing its part on a global stage.  ‘‘However, it also suggests May data will be very weak,
confirming the extent of the slowdown and the concern of the
authorities. The knee-jerk market reaction is risk positive, but
reassessment may keep investors cautious and selective.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
