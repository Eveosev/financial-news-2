Mexico’s peso fell, reversing initial
gains, as inflation quickened and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  said the U.S. economy is at risk from fiscal
spending cuts and Europe’s debt crisis.  The peso depreciated 0.3 percent to 14.0678 per  U.S. dollar 
at 4 p.m. in Mexico City. Earlier, the currency gained as much
as 1.4 percent after China cut  interest rates  for the first time
since 2008, a move that bolstered the outlook for global
economic growth.  Mexico’s inflation rate rose for the first time in four
months in May, climbing to 3.85 percent from 3.41 percent the
month before, the national statistics institute reported.
Bernanke warned lawmakers that “a severe tightening of fiscal
policy at the beginning of next year that is built into current
law -- the so-called fiscal cliff -- would, if allowed to occur,
pose a significant threat to the recovery.” Oil futures slipped
after his comments.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.12 percent, the
lowest level on a closing basis since August, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.19 centavo to 133.83
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
