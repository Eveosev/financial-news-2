Blackstone Group LP (BX)  reached an
agreement to take control of industrial properties valued at
about $2.1 billion from Walton Street Capital LLC, a day before
$2.45 billion of debt on the assets is due.  Walton Street, based in Chicago, agreed to transfer the 95
assets formerly known as the CalWest portfolio, said  Peter Rose ,
a spokesman for New York-based private-equity firm Blackstone.
The properties are located mostly in  California .  Blackstone acquired about $1 billion of debt on the
portfolio during the past two years, positioning it to take
control as a maturity default approached. Walton Street bought
the properties for about $2.8 billion five years ago as
commercial real estate prices peaked.  Eric Mogentale, managing principal at Walton Street, didnâ€™t
immediately respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
