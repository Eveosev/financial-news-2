Kevin Lai, an economist at Daiwa
Capital Markets, comments on  China ’s decision to cut  interest
rates  for the first time since 2008.  “This was a response to what’s going on in Europe and the
slowdown in China. There should be more cuts to the required
reserve ratio and relaxation on credit policy. We expect them to
do more in terms of monetary easing, credit policy and not so
much about fiscal stimulus.”  “The macroeconomic environment is not exactly the same as
it was in 2008, 2009. Jobs are still doing well, so there is no
rush for the government to come up with more stimulus at this
point.”  “The risk is still  on growth  being on the downside, so
they will try to minimize that risk. I don’t think there is a
huge concern about inflating the property bubble at this
stage.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
