HealthLease Properties Real Estate
Investment Trust (0355514D)  raised C$110 million ($107.3 million) in an
initial public offering, the largest Canadian IPO in more than
10 months.  The Toronto-based REIT sold 11 million units at C$10 each
in the IPO, according to sale documents. The units yield 8.5
percent, the high end of the expected range. HealthLease will
use the proceeds to buy seniors housing and care properties in
Western  Canada  and the U.S. Midwest.  HealthLease joins Chartwell Seniors Housing REIT,
 Extendicare REIT (EXE-U)  and  Leisureworld Senior Care Corp. (LW)  among
Canadian firms anticipating rising demand for seniors housing
and long-term care facilities as  North America ’s population ages
and life expectancy increases. The senior population in Canada
and the U.S. is forecast to rise at about three times the rate
of the general population, HealthLease said.  “In the U.S., more than $400 billion in new construction
is needed over the next 35 years to meet anticipated demand,
while in Canada the required stock of long-term care and
assisted living facilities is expected to nearly double over the
next 20 years,” HealthLease said in an April 30 filing.  HealthLease plans to initially buy 15 seniors properties in
British Columbia,  Alberta  and the U.S., representing 1,931 beds
or suites.  HealthLease will buy nine facilities in Indiana and
Illinois from Mainstreet Property Group LLC, and six Canadian
properties from  Northern Property Real Estate Investment Trust (NPR-U) ,
according to the filing. Mainstreet will have an 18 percent
interest in HealthLease after the close of the sale, expected
June 15. Paul Ezekiel Turner, chief executive officer of
HealthLease, declined to comment.  Largest IPO  HealthLease is the largest Canadian-listed IPO since Dundee
International Real Estate Investment Trust raised C$410 million
in July. HealthLease is Canada’s second REIT IPO this year,
after the C$82.5 million sale of Morguard North American
Residential REIT. Morguard North American has  risen  9.2 percent
since its April 18 debut on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  Canadian real estate investment trusts have outpaced
Canada’s benchmark index in the past year. The 13-company
 S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index (SPRTRE)  has risen 13 percent in the past 12
months, compared with the 12 percent decline of Canada’s
benchmark  S&P/TSX Composite Index. (SPTSX)   HealthLease’s 8.5 percent dividend yield is higher than the
5.1 percent average dividend yield of the REIT index and nearly
triple the 3 percent dividend yield of the Canadian benchmark
index. HealthLease will trade under the ticker symbol HLP-U.  Indicated Yield  HealthLease’s indicated yield compares to the 5.78 percent
indicated yield of  Chartwell Seniors (CSH-U)  Housing REIT and the 10.4
percent yield of Extendicare REIT, according to Bloomberg data.  HealthLease forecast C$20.8 million of annual revenue and
C$9.43 million profit for the 12-month period ending June 30,
2013, according to filings.  Canaccord Genuity and National Bank Financial are leading a
group of banks on the sale and have the option to buy an
additional 10 percent after the deal closes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
