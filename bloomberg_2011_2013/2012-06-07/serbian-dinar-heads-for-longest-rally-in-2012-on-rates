The Serbian dinar strengthened
against the euro for a fifth consecutive day, heading for its
longest stretch of gains in six months, as investors expect the
Balkan nationâ€™s central bank to increase its benchmark  interest
rate .  The currency was trading 0.6 percent higher at 114.4304
versus the European single currency at 10.28 a.m. in Belgrade,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Narodna Banka Srbije will probably increase the two-week
repurchase rate at its meeting today, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 22 economists. The central bank is seeking to curb
inflation after the currency declined to its lowest level on
record on May 31 when it was trading at 117.41 versus the euro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
