JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon “inflamed” public debate over a trade in
London that has so far cost at least $2 billion,  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) 
CEO Larry Fink said.  Dimon has represented the bank “fantastically” in the
past, “but I think in this case I think he enlarged the
issue,” Fink, whose company is the world’s biggest money
manager, said in an interview today on CNBC.  Dimon dismissed press reports in early April that the
bank’s chief investment office had built up an illiquid position
in  credit derivatives , calling them a “tempest in a teapot.”
He recanted after the bank on May 10 disclosed the loss, which
he said could grow by $1 billion or more. Dimon later said his
previous comments were “dead wrong.”  “It became inflamed somewhat by the reaction by
JPMorgan,” Fink said. “I don’t think it’s a big issue. I think
it may be more costly than $2 billion as they unwind it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
