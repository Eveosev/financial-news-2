Peruvian police are searching for a
helicopter and 12 foreign passengers that went missing in the
southern Andes yesterday.  The helicopter left the jungle town of Mazuco in the
evening carrying South Koreans and Austrian passengers and
disappeared as it crossed the Andes to reach the highland city
of Cuzco, police general Hector Dulanto told state television
channel TV  Peru .  The helicopter may have made an emergency landing in the
area of Hualla Hualla, located at more than 5,000 meters (16,400
feet) above  sea level , Dulanto said. It isnâ€™t known whether the
passengers are tourists or businessmen, he said. The pilot and a
second crewmember were Peruvian, TV Peru said on its  website 
without saying where it obtained the information.  The helicopter belonged to Helicopteros del Cusco SA, which
flies tourists to the Inca citadel of  Machu Picchu  and
transports personnel and cargo for the mining and oil and gas
industry, according to its website.  Police are heading to the area by land as bad weather
prevents a search by air, according to Lima-based  Radio
Programas .  To contact the reporters on this story:
