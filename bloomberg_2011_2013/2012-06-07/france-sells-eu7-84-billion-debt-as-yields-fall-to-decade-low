France  sold as much as 7.84 billion
euros ($9.9 billion) in debt, at the top end of its target,
taking advantage of investors’ flight to safety that pushed the
country’s borrowing costs to the lowest since 1999.  The country issued 3.48 billion euros in benchmark 10-year
bonds at an average yield of 2.46 percent, lower than the 2.96
percent in the last auction on May 3, Agence France-Tresor, the
debt-management body, said today. France also sold 685 million
euros in 50-year bonds for the first time since 2010.  Investor appetite for French debt has risen as President
 Francois Hollande  sticks to his pledge to shrink France’s budget
gap. That has put France -- which was stripped of its AAA rating
by Standard & Poor’s in January -- in the league of  Europe ’s
creditworthy north rather than its struggling south.  The yield on France’s benchmark 10-year bond slid last week
to an all-time low of 2.07 percent. The yield stood at 2.47
percent after the bond auction today. The spread with equivalent
German securities narrowed to 109 basis points from 142 when
Hollande took office on May 15.   While the European Commission said May 30 that France may
need to take “significant” steps to meet its target of reducing
its  budget deficit  to 3 percent of gross domestic product next
year, Hollande has reiterated that he expects to meet that goal
and plans to introduce fresh budget measures after the
parliamentary elections.  His Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said yesterday that
“it’s a promise that will be kept.”  French bonds, Europe’s second-best performers in May after
Dutch debt according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, may extend
the rally as investors seek shelter from the region’s crisis.  Spain  today sold 2.07 billion euros in debt, more than its 2
billion-euro target, with the amount demanded at 3.29 times the
securities offered. That was stronger than the 2.42 times in
April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
