U.S. state and city debt issuance may
total $330 billion this year, about $60 billion higher than in
2011, said John Hallacy, head of municipal research at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch.  While the lowest  interest rates  in a generation have
spurred local governments to refinance debt, more municipalities
are starting to issue bonds for new projects, Hallacy said. He
spoke today at the State & Municipal Finance Conference hosted
by  Bloomberg Link  in  Chicago .  “In the last few weeks there have been more new money
transactions,” Hallacy said. The share of such sales has risen
to almost 40 percent of 2012 issuance, from about 35 percent
earlier in the year, he said.  The increased borrowing to undertake fresh projects comes
as tax collections extend a rebound from the 18-month recession
that ended in 2009.  States’ tax revenue rose 4.1 percent in the first three
months of 2012, compared with a pace of 3.6 percent in the
previous quarter, the Nelson A.  Rockefeller Institute  of
Government in  Albany , New York, said today. It was the ninth
straight quarterly gain, the preliminary data show.  “We tend to think there will be more new money
transactions later in the year,” Hallacy said.  Municipalities have sold about $146 billion of long-term,
fixed-rate bonds in 2012, compared with $80 billion in the same
period of 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. tax-exempt securities have earned about 4 percent this
year, compared with 1.7 percent for Treasuries and 3.9 percent
for corporate debt, Bank of America index data show.  A fixed-income rally amid Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
helped drive a Bond Buyer  index  of 20-year general-obligation
yields down to 3.77 percent last week. It touched 3.6 percent in
January, the lowest since the 1960s.  To contact the reporters on this story:
