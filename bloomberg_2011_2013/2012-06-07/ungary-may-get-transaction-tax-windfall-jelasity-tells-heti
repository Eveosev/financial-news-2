Hungary may collect “several times”
more than the planned 130 billion forint ($436 million) of
financial transactions tax, Radovan Jelasity, the chief
executive officer of  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ’s local unit, told  Heti
Valasz .  Bank deposits of Hungarian households won’t
“substantially” increase after a law allowing early repayment
of foreign-currency loans at below-market rates depleted their
savings, Jelasity told the weekly newspaper in an interview.  The government’s new six-month Treasury bill aimed at
households is also making it harder for banks to increase
deposits, Heti Valasz cited Jelasity as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
