The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 6.5 basis points to
195.5 basis points as of 11:01 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank AG. The gauge is set for its biggest daily drop
since Feb. 1 and lowest close since May 29, CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  slid 3 basis points to 194 basis points
as of 8:01 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Deutsche Bank prices show. The
measure is also poised to close at its lowest level since May
29, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index tumbled 7 basis points to 189
as of 9:03 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark is headed for the biggest drop and lowest close since
May 28, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
