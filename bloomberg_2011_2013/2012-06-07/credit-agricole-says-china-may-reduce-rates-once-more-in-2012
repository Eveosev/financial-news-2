Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based
strategist at  Credit Agricole  CIB, comments on China’s decision
to cut  interest rates  for the first time since 2008. The
comments were published in an e-mailed note to clients.  The one-year deposit  rate  will drop to 3.25 percent from
3.5 percent effective tomorrow, the People’s Bank of China said
on its website today. The one-year lending  rate  will fall to
6.31 percent from 6.56 percent. Banks can offer a 20 percent
discount to the benchmark lending rate, the PBOC said, widening
from a previous 10 percent.  “The changes indicate mounting concern in Beijing over the
slowdown of growth, and come ahead of Saturday’s data that is
likely to show deceleration of output and lower inflation. They
amount to an official start of a rate-cutting cycle that we
believe will be short and modest - we expect only one more
reduction this year, in Q3.  ‘‘We expect a boost to demand for lending as a result of
the cuts, although the actual impact will be limited given the
low demand for credit, and the government will need to do more
to support aggregate demand, primarily on the fiscal side.
Still, the easing will help stimulate the economy, and makes
achieving this year’s growth target more likely. We continue to
expect 8 percent gross domestic product growth this year.  ‘‘We expect a rise in Chinese equities, in the  yuan ,
especially in offshore markets, and in risk assets in  Asia  and
around the world. Yuan interest-rate swap rates and Chinese
government bond yields are likely to fall.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
