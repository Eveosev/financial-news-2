State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or
Socar, plans to build two fertilizer plants at home and in
neighboring Georgia for $500 million each, Vice President for
Economic Affairs Suleyman Qasimov told reporters in Baku today.  Azerbaijan has agreed with Georgia on building a plant with
capacity to produce 700,000 metric tons of fertilizer a year,
Qasimov said. Socar will borrow money to build the plant in
Georgia, while the Azeri facility will be funded by the state,
he said.  So far, Socar has invested almost $700 million in Georgia,
including $400 million in an  oil terminal  in Kulevi on the  Black
Sea , the Socar executive said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
