Greek economic sentiment worsened in
May as the country’s political leaders failed to form a
government after elections that gave no party a majority.  An index measuring short-term economic trends slipped to 76
from 77.3 in April, the Athens-based  Foundation for Economic &
Industrial Research  said in an e-mailed report today. Sentiment
in the industrial sector dropped to 77.1 from 81.6, while in the
 construction industry  it fell to 36.5 from 40.8.  Consumer confidence  improved to minus 75.8 from minus 78.7,
and in the retail industry it improved to 58.2 from 52.4, the
foundation said.  Greece is preparing for its second national election in six
weeks on June 17. The inconclusive May 6 ballot showed gains for
parties, led by Syriza, that oppose terms of the country’s
bailouts from the European Union and the  International Monetary
Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
