European Union Employment
Commissioner Laszlo Andor said that  Italy ’s budget constraints
may lead to a reduction in the number of civil servants.  “We are all aware of the budget constraints for Italy and
Italy needs to focus on public consolidation,” Andor told
reporters in Rome at a press conference with Italy’s Labor
Minister Elsa Fornero. Italy’s shrinking budget “consequences
for employment in the public sector.”  After the economic crisis eases, “there won’t be the same
number of jobs in the  public sector and the same number of jobs
in the private sector,” the  commissioner also said.
Andor expressed his “strong support” for Italy’s overhaul of
the labor market, saying it’s important that the “reform is
passed soon by parliament without lowering its ambition.”  He said that the new firing rules included in the overhaul
may initially lead to more dismissals.  “In some situations, easing firing rules may worsen the
employment situation,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
