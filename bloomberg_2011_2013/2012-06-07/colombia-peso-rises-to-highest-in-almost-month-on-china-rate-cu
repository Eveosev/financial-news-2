Colombia ’s peso advanced to the
highest level in almost a month as China cut  interest rates  for
the first time since 2008, buoying prospects for global growth
and higher-yielding assets.  The peso appreciated 0.7 percent to 1,769.82 per dollar,
the strongest closing level since May 11. It has rallied 9.5
percent this year, the best performance among all currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  “China is what’s driving the market,” said William Florez, an analyst at Helm Bank SA’s brokerage unit in Bogota.
“The news from international markets helps calm investors, and
that benefits capital inflows to Colombia.”  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 7.07 percent, according to the central bank. The price
rose 0.402 centavo to 123.324 centavos per peso.  China ’s benchmark one-year lending rate will drop to 6.31
percent from 6.56 percent effective tomorrow, the People’s Bank
of China said on its website today. Policy makers also loosened
controls on banks’ lending and deposit rates, stepping up
efforts to combat a deepening slowdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
