U.S. stocks closed little changed as
a late-day slump in financial and technology shares wiped out an
early rally triggered by China’s first interest-rate cut since
2008.  Oracle Corp. and Bank of America Corp. lost at least 1.3
percent to pace the retreat in technology companies and banks,
while United Technologies Corp.,  Procter & Gamble Co . and Home
Depot Inc. rose more than 1 percent to lead the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  higher.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost less than 0.1 percent
to 1,315.00 at 4 p.m. in New York after rallying as much as 1.1
percent in early trading. The Dow ended the session up 46.17
points, or 0.4 percent, at 12,460.96 after rallying as much as
140 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
