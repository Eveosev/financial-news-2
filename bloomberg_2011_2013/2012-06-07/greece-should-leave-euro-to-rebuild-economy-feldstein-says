Greece should exit the euro area to
rebuild its economy with its own currency, Harvard University
economist  Martin Feldstein  said.  “Greece is in terrible shape -- I don’t think it can be
fixed,” Feldstein told Bloomberg Television today from
Copenhagen. “There is no solution,” barring indefinite
financial aid from stronger countries in the monetary union such
as Germany.  While a departure would generate “chaos” in the short
term, a newly traded drachma would be able to devalue against
other currencies and return Greece to growth and more robust
employment, Feldstein said.  In contrast, Italy is in “pretty good shape” as Prime
Minister  Mario Monti  enacts an agenda of budget consolidation,
Feldstein said. In  Spain , the government must prevent regional
authorities from driving up budget deficits, which pose a
“bigger problem” than the banking crisis.  European leaders have grasped that the two-year-old debt
crisis is “serious,” though they lack a “longer-term
strategy” on how to deal with indebted member states as they
approach their next summit meeting at the end of June, Feldstein
said.  Feldstein, a former president of the  National Bureau of
Economic Research  in the U.S. and a chief economic adviser to
President  Ronald Reagan , predicted that the euro was unworkable
before its inception. Last September he said in an interview
that the single currency had proved to be a “failure.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
