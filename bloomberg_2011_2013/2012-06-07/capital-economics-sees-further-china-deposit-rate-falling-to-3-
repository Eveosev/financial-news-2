Mark Williams , chief Asia economist
at Capital Economics Ltd. in  London , comments on China’s first
interest-rate cut since 2008, in an e-mailed note to clients.  The one-year deposit  rate  will drop to 3.25 percent from
3.5 percent effective tomorrow, the People’s Bank of China said
on its website today. The one-year lending  rate  will fall to
6.31 percent from 6.56 percent. Banks can offer a 20 percent
discount to the benchmark lending rate, the PBOC said, widening
from a previous 10 percent.  “The move is clearly a response to a string of
disappointing economic data and, in particular, the weakness of
credit growth in the wake of government stimulus calls. Many
harbor doubts about the wisdom of another credit-fueled
stimulus, but the government’s overriding objective is to ensure
that the economy is not too fragile in the final months before
the leadership transition.  ‘‘We believe that the rate cut will be effective in meeting
the short-term objective of getting credit and the economy
moving. Banks’ failure to extend more than a trickle of new
loans has spooked policy makers and they have apparently
concluded that the level of  interest rates  has become a
constraint on loan demand.  ‘‘We expect the benchmark 12-month lending rate to finish
2012 at 6.06 percent and the deposit rate at 3.00 percent, both
down by a further 25 basis points down from today.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
