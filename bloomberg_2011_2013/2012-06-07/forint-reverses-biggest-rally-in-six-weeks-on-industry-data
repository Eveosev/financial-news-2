The forint weakened after the biggest
rally in six weeks yesterday as data showed that  Hungary ’s
industrial output unexpectedly plunged in April.  Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 299.01 per
euro by 9:23 a.m. in Budapest after strengthening 1.5 percent
yesterday.  Output dropped a workday-adjusted 3.1 percent from a year
ago after a 0.6 percent increase in March, the Budapest-based
statistics office said today based on preliminary data. The
median estimate of 14 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for
0.5 percent growth. Production fell 2.4 percent from March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
