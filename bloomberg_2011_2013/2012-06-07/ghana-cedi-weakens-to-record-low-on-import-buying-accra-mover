Ghana ’s cedi weakened to the lowest
in at least 19 years against the dollar as importers demanded
U.S. currency to import raw material and goods for resale in
West  Africa ’s second-biggest economy.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.4 percent to 1.9175 per dollar as of 1:30 p.m. in
Accra, the lowest since June 1993 when Bloomberg began compiling
the data.  “Demand for dollars is high on the market, today we saw
demand from telecommunication companies, manufacturing companies
as well as the general commerce industry,” Jacob Brobbey, a
currency trader at the local unit of Barclays Bank Plc, said by
phone. “The supply side is weak.”  Ghana’s currency has dropped 14.5 percent this year, making
it the second-worst in Africa after Malawi’s kwacha and pushing
up prices in the import-dependent country. Inflation accelerated
to the highest in 14 months at 9.1 percent in April.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
