State Oil Co. (ATPG)  of  Azerbaijan  is in
talks with European banks including  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  and Citigroup Inc. to borrow $500 million this year,
said Suleyman Qasimov, vice president for economic affairs.  Socar, as the oil and gas producer is known, is also
talking with Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, Natixis,  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,
Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS, and VTB Group, Qasimov told reporters
today in the capital, Baku.  The funds will be used for projects both in Azerbaijan and
abroad, including the Star refinery under construction in
Turkey’s Izmir region, Qasimov said.  Socar has about $1.6 billion of foreign debt, which is
“quite manageable,” Qasimov said. The Baku-based company sold
$500 million of debut Eurobonds last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
