The amount of sugar waiting to be
loaded at the main ports in  Brazil , the world’s largest
producer, climbed 37 percent over the past week after rain
disrupted deliveries.  The total waiting to be loaded was almost 2.2 million
metric tons of sugar yesterday, according to shipping agency
Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda. That compares with 1.6 million
tons a week earlier.  Wet weather will increase waiting times as ports are unable
to load sugar when it’s raining, according to consultancy SA
Commodities in Santos. Rains in sugar producing areas this week
will also disrupt harvesting at least until tomorrow, according
to weather forecaster Somar Meteorologia.  About 20 percent, or 430,250 tons, of all the sugar
waiting at ports in Brazil will be sent to  China , data from
Williams Brasil show. China is set to import 3.1 million tons of
sugar in the 2011-12 season that started in October, up 1
million tons from a year earlier, the  International Sugar
Organization  in London estimated last month.  Brazil is starting to supply more sugar to the  Far East 
than  Thailand , according to Swiss Sugar Brokers. That’s helping
support a premium of raw sugar from Brazil, it said
The two nations are the largest global exporters of the
sweetener, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Raw sugar for June loading at Santos was 0.15 cent to 0.2
cent above the ICE Futures U.S. July contract on June 3, Swiss
Sugar said. That compares with a premium of 0.12 cent on May
27. In Thailand, raw sugar for June loading was at a premium of
1.8 cents to 2.5 cents on June 3, according to the broker.  Raw sugar for July delivery climbed 2.1 percent to 20.32
cents a pound by 10:24 a.m. in  London  on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
