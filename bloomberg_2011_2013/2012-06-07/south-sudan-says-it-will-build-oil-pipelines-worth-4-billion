South Sudan  is planning to spend as
much as $4 billion to build pipelines to ship its oil through
Kenya and  Djibouti  to reduce its reliance on neighboring  Sudan ,
a deputy minister said.  “Within three years oil will start flowing” through the
pipelines, Deputy Minister for Telecommunications and Postal
Services Khamisa Wani-Ndah said today in an interview in Cape
Town. South Sudan is in talks with international lenders and
companies about the projects, she said, declining to name them.  South Sudan shut down its 350,000 barrels a day in oil
production in January after accusing Sudan of stealing $850
million worth of its oil. Sudan said it confiscated the crude to
make up for unpaid fees for shipping it through a pipeline to
 Port Sudan .  The government signed a memorandum with Ethiopia in
February to build a pipeline via Djibouti, and said that it’s in
talks with a Texas-based construction company to build another
line to the Kenyan coastal town of Lamu.  South Sudan’s government, which relies on oil earnings for
98 percent of its revenue, has cut its annual budget by a
quarter as a result of the crude shutdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
