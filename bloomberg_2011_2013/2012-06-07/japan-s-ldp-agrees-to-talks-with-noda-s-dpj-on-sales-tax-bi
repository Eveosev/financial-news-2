Japan ’s main opposition Liberal
 Democratic Party  agreed to talks with the ruling Democratic
Party on Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda’s bill to double the
 consumption tax  in order to pay for soaring welfare costs.  LDP Secretary-General Nobuteru Ishihara announced the
decision at a press conference today in Tokyo. His party has
called for the DPJ to withdraw legislation to revise the social
security system in return for support on the tax bill.  Noda this week acceded to opposition calls to replace two
of his Cabinet ministers in order to win support for the
legislation, which he says is necessary to address a declining
birthrate and aging society. Failure to raise the five percent
tax threatens to worsen the world’s largest debt, an issue  Fitch
Ratings  cited last month in cutting Japan’s credit rating.  The public is increasingly at odds with Noda’s push to pass
the legislation before parliament is scheduled to end on June
21. The number of voters opposed to the tax rose 5 percentage
points to 56 percent this month from May, while those in favor
fell 7 points to 32 percent, an Asahi newspaper poll yesterday
showed. Almost three-fourths said there is no need to pass the
bill during the current session.  To contact the reporters on this story:
