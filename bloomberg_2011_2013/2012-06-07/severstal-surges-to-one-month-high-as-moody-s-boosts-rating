OAO Severstal,  Russia ’s second-
largest steel producer, jumped to a one-month high as Moody’s
Investors Service raised the company’s rating to one step below
investment grade, citing profitability and “healthy” cash
flow.  The stock surged 3 percent to 386.20 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the highest price since May 3. Severstal’s $500 million
of Eurobonds due 2016 extended gains, cutting the yield by 51
basis points, or 0.51 percentage point, to 6.593 percent. A
close at this level is the lowest since May 11, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Today’s rating action reflects continued improvement in
Severstal’s operating performance and financial profile,
including solid profitability aided by a favorable cost profile
and healthy  cash flow  generation,” Moody’s analysts led by
Steven Oman said in an e-mailed note.  Moody’s lifted Severstal to Ba1 from Ba2, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
