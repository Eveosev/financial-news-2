Tom Johnson  and Joe Marler will make
their England rugby team debuts in this weekend’s tour-opening
Test against  South Africa .  Exeter’s Johnson will replace the injured  Tom Croft  at
flanker for the June 9 match in Durban and Harlequins prop
Marler takes over for Alex Corbisiero. Northampton’s  Ben Foden 
will also start at left wing for injured David Strettle and
Harlequins’ Mike Brown comes in at fullback.  “Tom and Joe have had great seasons at their clubs and
have worked really hard to get this chance, both are in great
form and have really impressed in training,” coach Stuart
Lancaster said in a statement.  England will play the two-time world champion Springboks in
two more Tests, in Johannesburg on June 16 and  Port Elizabeth 
seven days later. It also faces the Barbarians, an invitational
line-up, twice as part of its five-game tour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
