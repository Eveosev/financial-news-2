President Richard Fisher said U.S. lawmakers must bring federal
spending more in line with revenue as the Chinese  yuan  one day
may rival the dollar’s dominant role.  “We face a very real risk of having formidable competitors
to the dollar in the sweepstakes for sovereign investment,”
Fisher said today in remarks prepared for a speech in La Jolla,
California. “As Chinese policy makers lay the groundwork for
the continued internationalization of the  renminbi , our nation’s
fiscal authorities must bear in mind that there may one day be
viable alternatives to the dollar and U.S. Treasury debt.”  China announced loosened control on banks’ lending and
deposit rates starting tomorrow in a move UBS AG called a
“milestone.” The decision coincided with the country’s first
interest-rate cut since 2008 to counter the global economic
slowdown.  “The most pressing challenge confronting China is
reforming its domestic financial sector by permitting
competition from the private sector and allowing the market to
determine asset prices such as  interest rates ,” Fisher said at
a forum held by the University of California, San Diego today.  Fisher didn’t discuss the U.S. economy or monetary policy
in his speech today. He is not a voting member of the policy-
setting Federal Open Market Committee this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
