Folli-Follie Group (FFGRP) , a Greek
manufacturer and retailer of handbags and other accessories, has
a contingency plan in case the country has to leave the euro
area, Chief Executive Officer George Koutsolioutsos said.  “A big company, for its shareholders as well, should have
a plan,” Koutsolioutsos said in a telephone interview from his
Athens office today. “We don’t expect to have to implement it
but we definitely can’t just completely ignore it.” He declined
to give further details of the plan.  Concern that  Greece  may exit the euro increased after
elections on May 6 failed to produce a government, leading the
country to a second vote on June 17. Recent polls show Syriza,
Greece’s biggest anti-bailout party, level with  New Democracy .  A Greek euro exit wouldn’t affect Folli-Follie “that
much” because a significant part of its operations are outside
Greece, Kousolioutsos said. It would be “catastrophic” for the
country, especially after the added pressures on Greeks of five
years of recession, he said.  Koutsolioutsos said gross sales in the second quarter of
the year are rising in line with the 4.6 percent increase in the
previous quarter. International sales increased 11 percent in
that period, he said. The company has a presence in 28
countries.  Shares of Folli-Follie gained 4.7 percent to 4.4 euros at
1:13 p.m. in Athens trading, on course for a second day of
gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
