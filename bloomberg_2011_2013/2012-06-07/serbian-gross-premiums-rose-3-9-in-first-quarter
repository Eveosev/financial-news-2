Gross written insurance premiums in
 Serbia  rose 3.9 percent in the first quarter, led by growth in
 life insurance  policies.  The premiums totaled 14.9 billion dinars ($162 million) in
the first three months, with life insurance growing 11.2 percent
to 2.56 billion dinars, and non-life insurance expanding 2.5
percent to 12.33 billion dinars, according to a central bank
report.  Three top insurers in the country,  Dunav Osiguranje AD (DNOS) ,
 DDOR Novi Sad AD (DDNS)  and  Delta Osiguranje AD (DEOS) , a unit of
 Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) , control about two-thirds of the
market, even as their combined share shrank to 66.1 percent from
67.4 percent a year ago, as more companies entered the market,
the Belgrade-based Narodna banka Srbije said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
