Cooking oil  imports  by  India , the
world’s second-biggest consumer, may climb 15 percent this year
as a drop in local oilseeds harvest reduces supplies, according
to GG Patel & Nikhil Research Co.  Purchases may increase to 9.7 million metric tons in the
year that began Nov. 1 from 8.4 million tons a year earlier,
Managing Partner Govindlal G. Patel, who’s traded cooking oils
for more than three decades, said in an interview in Mumbai.  Palm oil, used in everything from candy bars to biofuels,
plunged 17 percent from a 13-month high in April as growth
slowed in  China , the biggest cooking oil user, and the debt
crisis worsened in  Europe . Increased imports by India, the
largest  palm oil  buyer, may support prices and help a recovery
in futures in  Malaysia .  Palm-oil products shipped from Malaysia to India this year
will exceed last year’s 1.82 million tons, Minister of
Plantation Industries & Commodities Bernard Dompok said in
Mumbai. The South Asian nation may buy 7 million tons of the
tropical oil this season, Patel said.  The August-delivery contract on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange climbed as much as 1.2 percent to 3,039 ringgit ($959)
a ton and ended the morning session at 3,020 ringgit.  Oilseed production in India may drop to 30.1 million tons
in 2011-2012 from 32.5 million tons a year earlier, according to
the farm ministry. That spurred an increase in cooking-oil
imports for a third straight month in April. Purchases almost
doubled to 925,334 tons in April from a year earlier, the
Solvent Extractors’ Association of India said May 11.  Palm oil comprises almost 80 percent of India’s annual
cooking-oil imports. The South Asian nation buys palm oil from
Indonesia and Malaysia, and  soybean oil  from Brazil and
Argentina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
