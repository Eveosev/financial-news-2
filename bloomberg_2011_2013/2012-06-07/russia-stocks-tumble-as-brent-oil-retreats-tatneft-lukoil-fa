Russian stocks rose to the highest
level in three weeks as oil surged after  China  cut rates. OAO
Novatek,  Russia ’s second-biggest natural-gas producer, rallied
after announcing a $600 million buyback.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  jumped 1.8 percent to 1,336.33 by the close
in Moscow, the highest level since May 15 after falling as much
as 1.2 percent earlier. Novatek rose 5.9 percent, the most in
almost a year. OAO Transneft, Russia’s oil-pipeline operator,
surged the most in two weeks after the Economy Minister said the
state will retain a majority stake in the company.  Crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, added 0.5 percent
to $85.48 a barrel after falling as much as 0.6 percent earlier.
China cut its benchmark rates for the first time since 2008 in a
bid to bolster growth, stoking appetite for riskier emerging-
market assets as investors bet policy makers around the world
will follow suit.  “The hope is that this would stoke Chinese demand,”
 Kingsmill Bond , chief strategist at Citigroup Inc. in Moscow,
said by phone. “It’s helpful short-term as a part of a package
of monetary easing policies but it’s not a panacea.”  Transneft rallied 4.2 percent to 44,341 rubles after
Economy Minister Andrei Belousov said the government plans to
reduce its stake in the company to 75 percent plus one share by
2016.  Asset-Sale Plan  The state asset-sale plan approved today also calls for the
government by 2016 to sell its entire stakes in OAO Rosneft, the
country’s biggest oil company, OAO RusHydro, its biggest
renewable energy producer, power utility OAO Inter RAO UES and
overseas crude producer OAO Zarubezhneft. The government will
reduce its stake in high-voltage transmission monopoly Federal
Grid Co. by the same date, Belousov said.  RusHydro gained 4.7 percent to 85.03 kopeks, the highest
level in three weeks. Federal Grid climbed 2 percent to 19.33
kopeks. Inter RAO added 1 percent to 2.7 kopeks.  Novatek will buy back as much as $600 million of shares and
global depositary receipts within a year from today, the company
said today in a statement. The stock purchased under the program
may be used for financing operations or in employee compensation
and incentive programs, Novatek said.  OAO Severstal gained 3 percent to 386.20 rubles. Russia’s
second-largest steel producer jumped to a one-month high as
Moody’s Investors Service raised the company’s rating to one
step below investment grade, citing profitability and
“healthy”  cash flow .  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index increased 1.3 percent to
914.09 today, the highest intraday level since May 30, while the
 MSCI BRIC (MXBRIC)  Index of shares traded in  India ,  Brazil , Russia and
China, added 0.3 percent.  Russian stocks trade at 4.9 times  estimated earnings ,
having lost 6.2 percent this year. That compares with a 0.3
percent drop for the  MSCI Emerging-Market Index (MXEF)  which trades at
9.4 times projected earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
