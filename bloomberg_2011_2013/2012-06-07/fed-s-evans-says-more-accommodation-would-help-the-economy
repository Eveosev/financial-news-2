President  Charles Evans  said that “more accommodation would be
good” for the world’s largest economy as the recovery stalls.  “We benefit from more accommodation anyway, even when the
economy is growing at 2.5 percent,” Evans said today in a CNBC
interview. “We can do better than that.”  The Chicago Fed chief’s comments echoed those from his  June
5 speech  at New York University, where he said “soft” U.S.
economic data call for “extremely strong accommodation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
