Song Seng Wun, an economist with CIMB
Research Pte. in  Singapore , comments on China’s decision to
cut  interest rates  for the first time since 2008.  “This is not a huge surprise as such a move has been
flagged in advance. The only question was will the PBOC cut
before or after the latest batch of macro data release. Perhaps
the central bank had a preview of the May macro data and felt
that the underlying growth momentum is slowing faster than it is
comfortable with. Rather than a more aggressive 50 pt, the 25 bp
cut is an indication that the central bank is taking a more
measured response than be panicked into a more aggressive
response.”  On further RRR cuts:  “Yes. There should be a couple more going by the profile
of maturing papers.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
