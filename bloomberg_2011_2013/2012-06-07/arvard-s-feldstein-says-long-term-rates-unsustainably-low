Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein said long-term interest rates are unsustainably low
and warned more quantitative easing from the  Federal Reserve 
would do little to aid a recovery of the U.S. economy.  QE to date has done little to support the labor market or
businesses, Feldtsein said at a meeting of the Institute of
International Finance in Copenhagen today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
