Ferrara Pan Candy Company Inc.
increased the  interest rate  it will pay on a $425 million term
loan B it’s seeking to finance its merger with Farley & Sathers
Candy Company Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The six-year debt will now pay interest at 6.25 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, compared
with a range of 5.25 percentage points to 5.5 percentage points,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. The minimum on the benchmark will remain at 1.25
percent.  Ferrara is now proposing to sell the loan at 96 cents to 97
cents on the dollar compared with 98 cents to 99 cents initially
offered, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  Lenders will now receive call protection of 102 cents and
101 cents, according to the person. That means the Forest Park,
Illinois-based company would have to pay 2 cents more than face
value to replace the loan during the first year and 1 cent more
than par to refinance the debt during the second year.  Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are arranging
the financing and investors must let the banks know by 10 a.m.
tomorrow in  New York  whether they will participate in the deal,
according to the person.  Catterton Partners currently owns Farley’s & Sathers and
will remain a majority investor in the combined company,
according to a May 23 statement.  Andrea Rose, a spokeswoman for Catterton Partners, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
