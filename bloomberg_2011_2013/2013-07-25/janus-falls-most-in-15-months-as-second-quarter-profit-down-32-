Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) , owner of
the Janus, Intech and Perkins funds, fell by the most in more
than a month after second-quarter profit declined 32 percent.  The shares dropped 3.8 percent to $9.34 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York, the most since June 20. Janus has climbed 9.6 percent this
year, compared with a 29 percent gain by the  Standard & Poor’s 
index of asset managers and custody banks.  Net income decreased to $15.8 million, or 8 cents a share,
from $23.4 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier, the Denver-based firm said today in a statement. Earnings were reduced by 6
cents a share because of costs associated with the early
retirement of debt and the decline in value of  seed capital .  Investors withdrew a net $5.4 billion in the three months
ended June 30, marking the company’s 16th consecutive quarter of
client redemptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
