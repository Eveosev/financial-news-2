Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , the Ontario-based company with manufacturing operations in  China , completed
30 megawatts of rooftop solar systems on 129 buildings in China.  The systems will be connected this month and next to the
power grid in the city of Suzhou, about 100 kilometers (63
miles) west of Shanghai, the Guelph, Canada-based company said
today in a statement.  The project was developed as part of China’s Golden Sun
program, which offers subsidies to installers. Canadian Solar
will receive about 116 million  yuan  ($18.9 million) from the
national government, or about 70 percent of the total cost,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The country is expected
to unseat Germany as the world’s largest solar market this year,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Ownership of a majority of the projects may be transferred
to the rooftop owners or other investors, Canadian Solar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
