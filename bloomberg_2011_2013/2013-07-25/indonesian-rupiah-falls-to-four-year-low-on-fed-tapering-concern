Indonesia ’s rupiah fell to a four-year low on concern rising U.S. home sales will prompt the
 Federal Reserve  to start reducing stimulus that has spurred
demand for emerging-market assets.  June sales of new houses in the world’s largest economy
climbed to a five-year high, official figures showed yesterday.
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week the central bank
will respond to data in determining whether to taper or increase
its monthly bond purchases.  Global funds  added 3.31 trillion
rupiah ($323 million) to holdings of local-currency government
debt this month, after pulling 19.98 trillion rupiah in June,
finance ministry data show.  The rupiah declined 0.1 percent to 10,268 as of 3:33 p.m.
in Jakarta, after reaching 10,286 earlier, the weakest level
since July 2009, prices from local banks show. The spot rate
traded at a 2.4 percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable
forwards, which fell 0.4 percent to 10,519 after touching a
four-year low of 10,548, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A
 fixing  by the Association of Banks in  Singapore  that is used to
settle the forwards was set at 10,299.  “The market is data-dependent and the focus is still very
much on the tighter Fed funding and what that means for the
rupiah,” said Sim Moh Siong, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Bank of Singapore Ltd. “The fact that  Bank Indonesia  allowed
the rupiah to depreciate has relieved some capital outflow
pressure, but we would like to see a more hawkish tone.”  New Equilibrium  The exchange rate is in line with economic fundamentals and
is moving toward a new equilibrium, Bank Indonesia said in a
statement this week. The central bank has allowed the currency
to gradually weaken this month, Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo
said on July 12, adding that the 75 basis point increase in the
 reference rate  to 6.5 percent over the past two meetings is
enough to manage inflation.  The monetary authority granted $1.22 billion of currency
swaps at an auction today, compared with a $600 million target
and the $1.49 billion of bids received, Peter Jacobs, director
of communications, said by phone today. Bank Indonesia is
considering offering the swaps more often than the current
weekly schedule to meet foreign-currency demand, Governor Agus
Martowardojo said in Jakarta today.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 12.47 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 rose 22
basis points to 7.99 percent, according to prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association. The rate will fall to 6.8 percent to
7.3 percent by year-end, PT Mandiri Sekuritas analysts led by
Jakarta-based Handy Yunianto wrote in a research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
