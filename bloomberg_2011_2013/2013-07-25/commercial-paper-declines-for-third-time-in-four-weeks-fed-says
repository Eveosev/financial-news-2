The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  contracted for the third time in four
weeks as issuance by domestic financial institutions declined.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
dropped $3.1 billion to $996.1 billion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
That’s the least since the $990.5 billion in the period ended
July 10, an eight-month low.  Commercial paper issued by U.S.-based banks  fell $4 billion
to $262.4 billion outstanding, the lowest level in two weeks,
according to the Fed. Corporations sell commercial paper,
typically maturing in 270 days or less, to fund everyday
activities such as rent and salaries.  “The decline in commercial paper issuance by financial
companies probably reflects more than anything else a continuing
effort to reduce dependency upon short-term debt obligations,”
Tony Crescenzi, executive vice president at Newport Beach,
California-based Pacific Investment Management Co., wrote in an
e-mail.  “This is apparent in not only the commercial paper market
but the repo market, which has also shrunk since the onset of
the financial crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
