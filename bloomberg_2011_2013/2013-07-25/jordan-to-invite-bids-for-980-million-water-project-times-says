Jordan, one of the world’s driest
countries, will seek bids by the end of the year for a $980
million project to desalinate water from the  Red Sea  and
replenish the shrinking Dead Sea, the  Jordan Times  reported.  The project would transfer water from the Red Sea to a
desalination plant with capacity of 200 million cubic meters a
year in Wadi Araba, the Amman-based newspaper said, citing
Minister of Water and Irrigation Hazem al-Nasser. A pipeline
would run from the plant to the Dead Sea to discharge the brine.  Jordan plans to get $300 million to $400 million in grants
for the venture, Nasser said, according to the report. The
project replaces the $10 billion Jordan Red Sea Development plan
adopted in 2009, which was dropped after costs rose, he said.  The country ranks fourth among the world’s most water-poor
nations, according to the New York-based International Crisis
Group. About a third of the  Dead Sea ’s surface area has
disappeared and sinkholes are common as the waters shrink amid
drought, agricultural diversion and pumping to extract minerals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
