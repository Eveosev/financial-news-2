Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings
Ltd. (YZJ) , China’s second-biggest private yard, will become the first
Singapore-listed company to trade in Chinese  yuan .  The Chinese shipbuilder, which debuted on the Singapore
exchange in April 2007, will start trading in yuan under the
bourse’s dual-currency trading platform on Aug. 5, Singapore
Exchange Ltd. said in a statement today.  “This is an exciting and positive development for
Singapore as an offshore yuan centre,”  Magnus Bocker , Chief
Executive Officer of Southeast Asia’s biggest bourse, said in
the statement. “It also demonstrates how SGX is contributing to
the infrastructure and capabilities required for issuers and
investors to tap on opportunities offered by China.”  More companies may want to offer dual currency trading on
the Singapore bourse, especially those with China-based
operations, said Low Pei Han, an analyst at Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. There are already 142 Chinese companies listed in
Singapore with a total market capitalization of S$26.3 billion
($20.7 billion) as of June 30, according to stock exchange  data .  “We deem this move positive for Yangzijiang as it broadens
the group’s investor base,” OCBC’s Low said. “This does not
change the underlying fundamentals of the company.”  Yangzijiang fell 2.1 percent to 93  Singapore  cents as of
11:09 a.m. in Singapore. The benchmark Straits Times Index
dropped 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
