STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. (067250)  led
gains among STX Group units in  Seoul  trading on speculation that
creditors will provide more loans to help revive the companies.  STX Offshore shares jumped by their 15 percent limit, the
most since September 2008, to 3,990 won as of 1:36 p.m.  STX Pan
Ocean Co. (028670) ,  South Korea ’s biggest commodities shipping company
under court receivership, also rose 15 percent, to 1,690 won.  Korea Development Bank, STX Group’s main creditor, may
consider acquiring STX Pan Ocean and providing more loans to STX
Offshore, Yonhap News reported yesterday after the market’s
close. Debt at STX Group has mounted since it set up a $1
billion shipbuilding and offshore complex in Dalian,
northeastern  China , before the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2008.  “There are expectations that the STX Group units will get
help from the creditors,” said Park Moo Hyun, an analyst at
E*Trade Securities Korea in Seoul. “But it will take some time
for the companies to get out of their current problems.”  Korea Development Bank  may consider buying STX Pan Ocean if
the company’s value improves, Yonhap News said, citing the
lender’s Chairman Hong Ky Ttack. The bank will sign a contract
with STX Offshore next week to normalize the company, which
could include providing more loans, according to the report.  Four STX Group units, including STX Offshore, are seeking
voluntary debt rescheduling from creditors.  The group, whose businesses range from shipbuilding to
components that go into vessels, has been trying to raise 2.5
trillion won ($2.2 billion) by selling stakes in units as bulk
shipping rates fell and ship orders tumbled.  The Baltic Dry Index, a global measure of commodity-shipping rates, fell 0.9 percent to 1,117 yesterday and has
dropped 91 percent from its peak in May 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
