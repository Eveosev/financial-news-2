Shire Plc (SHPG) , the world’s biggest maker
of drugs for attention deficit disorder, said second-quarter
profit rose 7.6 percent, helped by a widening market for its
top-selling product, Vyvanse.  Earnings excluding some items climbed to $452 million, or
$1.79 per American depositary share, from $420 million, or
$1.68, a year earlier, Shire, which has management offices in
Basingstoke,  England , said today in a statement. Analysts
predicted $1.64 per ADS, the average of 12  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Shire reiterated a forecast for percentage growth in
product sales this year to be in the mid-to-high single digits.
Earnings will increase by double digits, the company said.  Since taking over in May, Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov has been boosting the company’s sales force in
anticipation of a growing market for its best-selling drug,
Vyvanse for ADHD. The CEO has said he plans to restore a
“significant” portion of the 150 U.S. sales jobs cut last year
to cope with demand for Vyvanse as generic copies threaten sales
of Shire’s Adderall XR and Intuniv drugs for ADHD.  Shire rose 2 percent to 2,261 pence as of 12:10 p.m. in
 London . Before today, the stock had gained 25 percent including
reinvested dividends since Oct. 25, the day Shire said Ornskov
would succeed Angus Russell as CEO.  Revenue, which includes royalties and product sales,
climbed 6 percent to $1.28 billion, beating the average estimate
of $1.21 billion.  Vyvanse sales climbed 13 percent to $300 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
