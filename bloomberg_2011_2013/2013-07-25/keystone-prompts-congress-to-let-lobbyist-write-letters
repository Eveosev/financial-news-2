The letters commend the State
Department for its “thorough and transparent” analysis of the
Keystone XL pipeline and urge U.S. officials to approve the
project as soon as possible.  At least a dozen state and federal Republican lawmakers
wrote in support of the $5.3 billion project that would cross
six U.S. states. In doing so, they often pointed to the same
facts and the used the same language.  “Keystone XL will be critical to improving American  energy
security  and boosting our economy,” Representative Steve Stivers of  Ohio  wrote. So did Representative Jackie Walorski of
 Indiana . And Steve Daines of Montana. And  John Carter  of  Texas .
And Phil Gingrey of  Georgia .  The wording similarities aren’t coincidental. The letters
are all based on correspondence written by the Consumer Energy
Alliance, a Washington-based coalition of energy producers and
users, including  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  in Irving, Texas, and  Dow
Chemical Co. (DOW)  in Midland,  Michigan .  According to the letters, which quote the State
Department’s own draft environmental analysis, the project will
generate more than $5 billion in economic activity. Most note
the “additional 57 mitigation measures” project sponsor
 TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  agreed to take to reduce risks of a rupture.  Common Practice  The State Department also received thousands of comments in
opposition from environment groups, including a form letter
prepared by an organization that says it supports progressive
activism.  The letters based on the industry group’s model reveal a
practice common in Washington that often occurs out of public
view,  Meredith McGehee , policy director at the Campaign Legal
Center, which promotes campaign finance reform and ethics in
government, said in an interview.  Legislative correspondence and even legislation often are
at least partly the work of advocates for the interested
parties, she said.  “This is what lobbyists in town get paid for every day,”
McGehee said.  Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the  Sunlight Foundation , a
Washington group that promotes openness in government, said
congressional offices are stretched thin and have to rely on
outside research to support public policy positions.  “It’s much more common than most members of Congress would
admit,” Drutman said in an interview.  Lobbyist Link  The letters themselves don’t indicate any connection with
the Consumer Energy Alliance. Some vary from the format more
than others. Walorski’s letter notes the economic impact of
Keystone and skips thanking the State Department for its review.  Gingrey’s letter tracks the CEA’s draft letter more
closely.  Gingrey considers Keystone an “issue of national security
as well as economic development,” said spokesman Jen Talaber.
The pipeline would create as many as 7,700 jobs for Georgians,
she said, citing a statistic from the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers, which backs the pipeline.  R.C. Hammond, a Consumer Energy Alliance spokesman, said
the group sent the letters to dozens of lawmakers to show
support for Keystone as the State Department seeks reaction to
its draft analysis. That review released in March found little
environmental reason for the project not to be approved.  “The letter signatory is behind the letter, our job is to
provide the facts and a clear argument why a policy is good or
bad for the energy consumer,” Hammond said in an e-mail.  300,000 Signatures  He said he didn’t know how many members of Congress used
its letter to submit comments. The group sent a second letter
backing the project that  garnered  about 300,000 signatures from
citizens. Local chambers of commerce also signed on in support.  The State Department is releasing public comments -- more
than 1 million in total -- as it writes a final version of its
environmental report and weighs whether to approve the project
from Alberta across Montana and  South Dakota  en route to  Steele
City ,  Nebraska . The project would then connect to a southern leg
to Gulf Coast refineries already under construction.  The State Department has jurisdiction because Keystone
would cross an international border.  President  Barack Obama  rejected an original route after
officials in Nebraska said it threatened the Sand Hills, a
network of dunes and wetlands in the center of the state that
rest above an aquifer.  The Calgary-based  company  then proposed a route that
travels further east that avoids the Sand Hills, according to
the state. Nebraska’s legislature and governor backed the new
path.  Climate Test  The project has since become a yardstick critics say
they’ll use to measure of Obama’s seriousness in mitigating the
risks of  climate change .  Groups such as the  Sierra Club  argue that Keystone should
be rejected because it would promote development of Alberta’s
 oil sands , which they said would lead to more greenhouse gas
emissions that are tied to global warming. The State Department
review found that the oil sands would be developed with or
without Keystone. The Environmental Protection Agency asked for
a fuller review in the final version of the environmental impact
statement.  Each week the State Department releases a batch of  public
comments . When they are all released, the department says it
will complete its environmental review. That starts a 90-day
analysis to determine whether the project is in the U.S.
national interest, when issues including economic impact and
foreign relations will be considered.  ‘Least Intrusive’  The letters from the congressmen urge “swift action” in
approving Keystone, noting its “promising economic impacts.”
Some say Keystone is the “most efficient, safest and least
intrusive” option of transporting Canadian oil, and crude from
the U.S.’s Bakken Shale.  “It’s no secret that he’s been a very vocal supporter of
the pipeline,” Alee Lockman, a spokeswoman for Daines of
Montana, said in an interview.  Stivers “has always supported American energy
production,” said spokeswoman Kara Hauck in an e-mail. “He
received a draft letter supporting the Keystone XL pipeline,
reviewed it and signed it because he agreed with it.”  Indiana’s Walorski said in an e-mail that her constituents
“overwhelmingly support” Keystone because it benefits supplier
companies in the state.  The comments released publicly include dozens of local
officials and businesses that urge approval and point to the  tax
revenue , jobs and economic impact of the pipeline.  Opponents of the pipeline have employed a similar
technique.  Credo Cause  A letter written by Credo, which describes itself as a
social-change organization that backs progressive non-profits
and owns a mobile telephone company that generates revenue for
causes, has 900 pages attached with names of people endorsing
the group’s contention that Keystone is a “cynical sham.”  Some appeals are more personal. One handwritten note
includes a picture of family members holding up bottles of clean
well water they contend would be at risk if the pipeline is
approved.  Stan Karp -- the State Department withholds addresses, so
his is unknown -- sent a two-line, typed note: “I know I am a
nobody, but I still ask: please do not approve the Keystone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
