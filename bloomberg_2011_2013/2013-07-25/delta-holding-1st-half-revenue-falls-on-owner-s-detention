Delta Holding DOO’s revenue fell in
the first six months of the year, after  Serbia ’s richest man and
the company’s owner, Miroslav Miskovic, remained in detention on
corruption allegations.  First-half revenue fell 5.6 percent from a year before to
33.15 billion dinars ($384 million), 10 percent weaker than the
the company’s plan, Delta Executive Vice President Dejan Jeremic, said in Belgrade today. Earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization totaled 2.7 billion dinars.  The detention of Miskovic, who has maintained his
innocence, “of course influenced” Delta’s business, which may
recover in the second half when business typically improves by
10 percent to 20 percent, Jeremic said. Miskovic was released
from custody on July 23 after Delta posted bail. The trial has
not been scheduled yet.  “I still expect us to meet our full-year revenue target”
of about 700 million euros ($925 million), Jeremic said.  The company is turning the former Continental hotel into a
 Crowne Plaza  facility, due to open in December. It also runs
shopping malls and apple orchards, co-owns Delta Generali AD
insurer and controls imports of international fashion, food and
car brands including  Nike Inc. (NKE) , Ferrero SpA, Monsoon Plc,
Sergent Major, BMW and Honda.  Its plans for a new shopping mall, Delta Planet, in
Belgrade will be postponed to 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
