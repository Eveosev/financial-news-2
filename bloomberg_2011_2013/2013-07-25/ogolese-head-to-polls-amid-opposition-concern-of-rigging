Voters in Togo began casting their
ballots in a parliamentary election that’s been delayed for
eight months amid concerns by opposition parties that the poll
may be rigged.  The 7,500 polling stations opened at 7 a.m. and will close
at 4 p.m., Date Yao, a member of the Independent National
Electoral Commission, said in a phone interview today. About 3.1
million are registered to vote.  President Faure Gnassingbe’s ruling Union for the Republic
will seek to protect its majority in the 91-seat Parliament. The
main opposition Union of Forces for Change has threatened
protests if it believes the results are rigged. The group
challenged the outcome of a presidential vote in 2010 and says
the West African nation’s electoral commission is dominated by
supporters of Gnassingbe. The RPT denies the claim, saying the
ballot will be transparent and fair.  Togo borders Benin,  Ghana  and  Burkina Faso  on  Africa ’s west
coast. The $3.7 billion economy, which earns foreign currency
from exports of cotton, coffee and cocoa, is forecast to expand
5.1 percent this year from 5 percent in 2012, according to the
 International Monetary Fund .  Gnassingbe in 2005 succeeded his father, who had ruled the
nation of 6.1 million people since 1967, and was reelected in
2010 amid claims by the opposition of irregularities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
