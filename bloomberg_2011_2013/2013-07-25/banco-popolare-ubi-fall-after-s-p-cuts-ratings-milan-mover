Banco Popolare SC (BP)  and  Unione di
Banche Italiane SCPA  led decliners in Milan trading after
 Standard & Poor’s  lowered its ratings on 18 Italian banks,
citing higher economic risks.  Banco Popolare, Italy’s fourth-biggest bank, fell as much
as 2 percent, and was down 1.8 percent to 1 euro at 10 a.m.,
giving the company a market value of 1.77 billion euros ($2.3
billion).  Unione di Banche Italiane Scpa (UBI) , the country’s fifth-largest lender, declined 2.6 percent to 3.19 euros, while  Banca
Popolare dell’Emilia Romagna Scrl (BPE)  fell 2.5 percent to 4.89
euros.  “Because of the increased economic risks we see for
Italian banks, we believe they are now more exposed to a deeper
and longer recession than we had previously anticipated,” the
New York-based ratings company said in a statement late
yesterday. S&P didn’t cut  UniCredit (UCG)  SpA and  Intesa (ISP)  Sanpaolo SpA,
the country’s two biggest lenders, which had their ratings
confirmed.  UniCredit was unchanged at 4.05 euros, while Intesa
declined 0.9 percent to 1.4 euros.  “We agree that credit quality is the main risk for Italian
banks and could worsen further if the gross domestic product
bottom does not happen in the fourth quarter of 2013 and/or the
recovery is too low/too slow,” Anna Maria Benassi, an analyst
at Kepler Cheuvreux in Milan, wrote in a note today.  -- Editors: Dan Liefgreen, Mark Bentley  To contact the reporters on this story:
