Spot wholesale electricity in the
Eastern U.S. dropped as consumers in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states used less power than grid operators projected.  Temperatures will be below normal from Maine to Virginia
going into the weekend, according to WSI Corp. in Andover,
Massachusetts. The high temperature in Manhattan today will be
74 degrees Fahrenheit (23 Celsius), 10 below normal, while
Washington will be 9 lower than average at 79, said AccuWeather
Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania.  Spot power for  New York City  dropped $24.33, or 51 percent,
to average $27.78 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 10
a.m., grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Boston  slid
$20.59, or 55 percent, to $17.06.  PJM Interconnection LLCâ€™s benchmark Western hub, which
includes deliveries to Washington, fell $4.18, or 13 percent, to
average $27.88 a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
