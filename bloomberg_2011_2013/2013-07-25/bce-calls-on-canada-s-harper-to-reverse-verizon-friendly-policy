BCE Inc. (BCE) , Canada’s largest
telecommunications provider, is ramping up pressure on Prime
Minister  Stephen Harper  to reverse policies that the company
said would unfairly subsidize the entry of U.S. carriers such as
 Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  into Canada’s phone market.  BCE said the government’s decision to prevent Canada’s
largest phone companies from buying smaller rivals will allow
New York-based Verizon to acquire those businesses at “cut-rate
prices.” Other policies that will unfairly benefit Verizon
include the decision to reserve airwaves for new entrants and
rules that force incumbents to offer up their networks for use
by competitors, Montreal-based BCE said.  “Our federal government is unintentionally underwriting
the success of U.S. companies in Canada,” BCE Chief Executive
Officer George Cope said in a statement. The company also had a
two-page advertisement in the Globe and Mail newspaper today.
“We ask that Ottawa allow Canadian wireless companies a fair
chance to compete by closing these loopholes.”  BCE has fallen 12 percent since touching a 2013 high on May
22 in part due to concern that Verizon may acquire Toronto-based
Wind Mobile and buy wireless spectrum to build a fourth national
carrier in  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
