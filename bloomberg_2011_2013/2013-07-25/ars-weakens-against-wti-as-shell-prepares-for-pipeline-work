Mars Blend, an oil produced on the
Gulf Coast, fell against domestic benchmark West  Texas 
Intermediate as  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  prepared to shut a section
of its Houston-to-Houma pipeline.  The line, nicknamed Ho-Ho, is being reversed and expanded
to carry up to 250,000 barrels a day to Houma, Louisiana, from
Texas by early 2014. Shell will begin the project’s second phase
in August, closing a segment from Port Neches, Texas, to Houma,
Destin Singleton, a Houston-based spokeswoman for Shell, said
today. The work will be done by the end of 2013.  “Mars, which comes onshore in Louisiana, will no longer be
able to access Lake Charles and Port Arthur refineries through
the Ho-Ho line, and it may be seeking some alternative
markets,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston.  Mars Blend fell $1.50 a barrel against WTI to a 50-cent
discount at 2:26 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Light Louisiana Sweet sank 70 cents to a $5.40-a-barrel
premium over WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet weakened by 60 cents to
$5.20 above WTI.  Poseidon slipped $1.65 to a discount of 75 cents a barrel.
Bonito Sour and Eugene Island both dropped $1.25 a barrel to a
$2-a-barrel premium to WTI.  Crude from the Southern Green Canyon strengthened by 25
cents to a 75-cent premium to WTI. Thunder Horse was unchanged
at a $4 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
