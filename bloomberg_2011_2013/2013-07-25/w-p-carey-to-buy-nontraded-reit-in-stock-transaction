W.P. Carey Inc. (WPC) , an owner of single-tenant buildings and sponsor of nonlisted real estate investment
trusts, agreed to buy one of the companies it manages to expand
its property holdings.  The stock purchase of Corporate Property Associates
16–Global Inc. values the nontraded REIT at $11.25 a share, New
York-based W.P. Carey said today in a statement. CPA 16 had
about 217 million shares outstanding at the end of the first
quarter, according to a regulatory filing, putting the value of
the deal at about $2.4 billion.  The planned purchase will expand W.P. Carey’s ownership of
real estate leased to single tenants. At the end of March, CPA
16 owned or had an interest in 494 properties leased to 140
tenants, with an occupancy rate of 97.4 percent, according to a
quarterly filing.  “In addition to providing liquidity to CPA 16–Global
investors, it will significantly increase W.P. Carey’s asset
base, with a portfolio that will further enhance our already
broad diversification by tenant, property type and geography,”
W.P. Carey Chief Executive Officer Trevor Bond said in the
statement.  W.P. Carey will assume about $1.7 billion of the REIT’s
debt, according to a presentation on its website.  CPA 16, formed in 2003, had a net asset value of $8.70 a
share at the end of December, down from $9.10 at the end of
2011, according to a regulatory filing.  Shares of W.P. Carey have climbed 48 percent in the past
year to $67.81.  To contact the reporter on this story:
