South African white corn futures
gained on concern that the Crop Estimates Committee will lower
the country’s production estimate today due to bad weather.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, gained 0.4 percent to 2,330 rand ($238) a metric ton
by the midday close on the South African Futures Exchange. The
yellow variety for delivery in September, lost 0.4 percent to
2,154 rand a ton.  Total corn output for the 2013-14 season may be cut to 11.2
million tons, according to a median estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. That compares with last month’s forecast
of 11.38 million tons made by the government’s committee, which
is scheduled to release its latest forecast at 3:30 p.m. today
in Johannesburg.  “Concerns are that the Crop Estimates Committee will lower
their estimates, especially with the white corn,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes
Ltd., said by phone.  Some of South Africa’s main growing regions, including the
Free State province, which produces 40 percent of the country’s
corn, haven’t received sufficient rain for crops to grow, which
analysts and traders from BVG (Pty) Ltd., Senwes and Farmwise
Grains (Pty) Ltd. said will lead to lower-than-average yields.  The country produced 11.5 million tons of corn in 2012-13,
according to the South African Grain Information Service. Meal
made from white corn is one of the country’s staple foods and
yellow corn is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in December fell 0.2 percent to 3,295
rand a ton in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
