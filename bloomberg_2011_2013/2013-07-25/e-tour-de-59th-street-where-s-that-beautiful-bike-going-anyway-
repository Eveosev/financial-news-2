Swing by Central Park on a weekend and you'll see men in brightly colored Spandex whizzing along on their $6,000 bikes. It's fun to watch, but your heart goes out to them, astride machines built for the  Tour de France  but somehow on the Tour de Jackie Onassis Reservoir instead. If they're using their bikes only for the gentler inclines of mid-Manhattan, does it matter whether they're cruising on a Colnago or schlepping on a Schwinn?  "It's the difference between driving a Honda and a Porsche," says Jim Cooper, a custom bike fitter at  Signature Cycles  in New York. "Will they both do the same thing? Yes. Will you feel different when you're done? Yes." What about the finer distinctions among fine bikes, some far more expensive than others -- don't they amount to the difference between a Porsche and a Maserati for a trip to the supermarket? "The guy who can afford it and wants another trophy piece doesn't really know the difference," says Pablo D. Castro, co-owner of New York's  Echelon bike shop . "It's the guys who don't have a lot of money that still buy the most expensive bikes -- those are the people who understand the quality behind it, and understand the technical aspect and the aerodynamics." Castro, who races, explained where the money goes.  "The most expensive thing about a bicycle is its frame and fork. The second is the wheels. And the third is the component package" -- brakes, chains, pedals and so forth. When everything is top of the line, he says, "the ride quality is enormous. The handling is crisp, it absorbs vibration, and because it maximizes the energy you put into it, it doesn't fatigue you on long rides."  As an example, Castro cites his five-hour ride from New York to Bear Mountain, in the Hudson Valley, and back. "If I'm on a lower-end bike," he says, "it would take me six hours, not five." Those thousand-dollar bikes circling the park like sharks start to make a bit more sense (than  this , say). The riders aren't heading to the Alps, or even Bear Mountain, but they've got other things to contend with: Rollerbladers, plodding tourists, Citibikes. Godspeed, Spandex cyclists, and may you steer clear of New York's Mont Ventoux, the pothole.
