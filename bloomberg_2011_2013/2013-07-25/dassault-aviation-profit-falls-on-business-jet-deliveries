Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  said first-half
profit fell 26 percent as the maker of the Rafale fighter and
Falcon corporate jet delivered fewer business aircraft.  Adjusted net income dropped to 165 million euros ($217
million) from 164 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based
company said today in a statement. Revenue from Falcon planes
fell 8 percent to 1.3 billion euros as the company delivered 29
of the model compared with 34 jets a year earlier.  Corporate aircraft contributed 73 percent of total sales,
reflecting the company’s increasing reliance on civil rather
than military jets. Dassault’s only customer for the Rafale so
far has been the French government.  India  has pledged to buy 60,
though negotiations have stretched out past the original March
2013 deadline.  The net figure was adjusted to exclude amortization of the
purchase price allocation for raising its stake in defense-electronics maker  Thales SA (HO) , and as well as the effects of
currency-hedging derivatives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
