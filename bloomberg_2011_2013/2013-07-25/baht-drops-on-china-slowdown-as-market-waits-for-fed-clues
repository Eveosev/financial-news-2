Thailand ’s baht dropped by the most
in two weeks and bonds fell as a slowdown in  China  dimmed
regional growth prospects and investors waited for U.S. jobs
data for clues on whether the  Federal Reserve  will cut stimulus.  Manufacturing declined by more than estimated in China,
Thailand’s biggest export market, and home sales in the U.S.
rose to a five-year high, according to reports yesterday. The
number of people in the world’s largest economy continuing to
claim jobless benefits decreased by 89,000 in the week to July
13, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
before data due today, which may bolster the case for the Fed to
reduce bond buying that’s boosted fund flows to  Asia .  “Weakening growth prospects in Asia on the weak China PMI
yesterday” weighed on regional currencies, said Wee-Khoon Chong,
a Hong Kong-based strategist at Societe Generale SA. “All eyes
will be on claims data later today.”  The baht declined 0.4 percent, the most since July 8, to
31.07 per dollar as of 8:37 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 31.10 earlier, the weakest
level since July 19. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.16 percent.  A Purchasing Managers Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics yesterday showed a preliminary reading for
Chinese factory output of 47.7 in July, compared with a forecast
of 48.2. China took 12 percent of Thai exports in the first five
months of 2013, official data show.  Thai overseas sales rose 1.5 percent in June from a year
earlier after a 5.3 percent drop the previous month, according
to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey
before customs data due tomorrow.  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023
increased one basis point to 3.86 percent, the highest level
since June 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
