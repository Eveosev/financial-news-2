U.S. stock futures maintained losses
after jobless claims and orders for durable goods increased as
investors searched the data for clues on when the Federal
Reserve may reduce its bond-buying program.  Futures on the S&P 500 expiring in September lost 0.4
percent to 1,677.5 at 8:37 a.m. in New York. The equity
benchmark completed its first two-day drop in a month yesterday.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
increased 4.2 percent after a revised 5.2 percent gain in May
that was bigger than initially reported, the Commerce Department
said today in  Washington . The median forecast of 79 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1.4 percent advance. Unfilled
orders for big-ticket goods rose the most since December 2007.  Jobless claims rose by 7,000 to 343,000 in the week ended
July 20 from a revised 336,000 the prior period, Labor
Department figures showed today in Washington. The median
forecast of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected
340,000. The retooling at carmakers and school closings typical
during this time of year continued to influence the figures last
week, a spokesman said as the data were released.  The S&P 500 declined the most in a month yesterday as
investors weighed global manufacturing reports and corporate
earnings for signs on when the Fed may scale back its asset
purchases. Support from central banks and better-than-estimated
corporate earnings have driven the S&P 500 up as much as 151
percent from its March 2009 low.  The Fed has said economic data will determine the timing
and pace of any reduction in its $85 billion in monthly bond-buying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
