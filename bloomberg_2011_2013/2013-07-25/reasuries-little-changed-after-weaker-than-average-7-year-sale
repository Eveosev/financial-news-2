Treasury 10-year notes rose for the
first time in three days on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
maintain stimulus and reassure investors that policy makers
won’t be quick to raise  interest rates  at next week’s meeting.  Yields on benchmark security had reached the highest in
more than a week before an article from the Wall Street Journal
said the Fed, which buys bonds through its quantitative easing
program, is likely to revise guidance on rates when policy
makers meet July 30-31. The U.S. sold $29 billion of seven-year
notes at 2.026 percent, the highest level since July 2011.  “The story about the Fed keeping their QE asset purchase
program in place is giving the market a bid,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in  New York  of government-debt
trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co.  “It’s clear at this point we
are looking at a data dependent QE now and we are going to see
the Fed really reacting to what the economic data presents
them.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  note  fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.57 percent at 4:59 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. It
touched 2.63 percent, the highest since July 15. The 1.75
percent note due May 2023 rose 1/8, or $1.25 cents per $1,000
face amount, to 92 29/32.  The Fed, which has been buying  $85 billion  of bonds each
month to put downward pressure on borrowing costs, will start
trimming purchases in September, according to a Bloomberg survey
of economists.  Auction Stats  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , was $348.8 billion, the
highest level since July 17 and above the average of $282
billion in July.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was 82.6, falling from
this month’s high of 117.89 on July 5. The one-year average is
64.9.  “The market was trading heavy all afternoon after that
great auction, where dealers got the least amount of paper in 2
1/2 years,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist in
New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of 21 primary dealers that
trade with the central bank. “Once this article hit the tape,
it’s just been a one-way trade -- the market was already trading
very thin so it feels like it’s the article that’s driving us
right here.”  At today’s auction of notes, primary dealers bought 34.9
percent, the lowest since December 2010.  Demand Metrics  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 48.6 percent of the notes, the highest
since August 2011, compared with 46.4 percent in June and an
average of 38.6 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the  Treasury (USGG10YR) , purchased 16.6 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with 15.7 percent last month,
the least since July 2012, and an average of 19.1 percent for
the past 10 auctions.  The  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was below
average at 2.54, the lowest since May 2009, compared with an
average of 2.65 for the past 10 sales.  ‘General Apathy’  Seven-year notes have lost 3.8 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 2.8 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The seven-year
securities returned 3.9 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the third of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion. The government sold $35 billion in
two-year debt July 23 and another $35 billion in five-year debt
yesterday.  “There’s general apathy in the marketplace -- the levels
in fives and sevens were where there was reasonable interest in
the marketplace,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of
Treasury trading in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “Until
you see a stronger string of economic activity in either
direction, it will be difficult for the market to trade away
from here appreciably. The market will be more defensive going
into next week.”  The sales, plus an auction of $15 billion of 10-year
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities last week, will raise
$54.6 billion of new cash, as maturing securities held by the
public total $59.4 billion, according to the  U.S. Treasury .  To contact the reporters on this story:
