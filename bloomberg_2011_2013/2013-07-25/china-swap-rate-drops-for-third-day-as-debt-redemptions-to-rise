China ’s  interest-rate swaps  dropped
for a third day on speculation the supply of cash will improve
as central bank bill redemptions rise.  A total of 85 billion yuan ($14 billion) of notes will
mature next week, compared with zero this week, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The seven-day repurchase rate
touched an all-time high last month as regulators reined in the
money supply in an effort to curb lending that doesn’t involve
local banks, known as shadow banking.  “Pockets of funding stress are evident in the system but
more broadly, expectations have been much better anchored than
the episode we saw in late June,” said Pin Ru Tan, an interest-rate strategist at HSBC Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.
“Looking into next week, the 85 billion  yuan  of three-year
central bank bill redemptions should help to alleviate the
situation.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.06 percent as of
10:40 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The seven-day  repo rate , which measures interbank funding
availability, gained five basis points to 4.1 percent, according
to a weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank
Funding Center.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
