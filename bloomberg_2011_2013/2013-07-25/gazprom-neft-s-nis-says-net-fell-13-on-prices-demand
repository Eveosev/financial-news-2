Naftna Industrija Srbije AD, the
Serbian oil and gas company controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , said
its six-month profit dropped because of cheaper crude and waning
demand in  Serbia .  Net income fell to 19.1 billion dinars ($221 million) from
22 billion dinars a year earlier, even as NIS increased gas and
oil output 4 percent to 817,800 tons of oil equivalent, Chief
Executive Officer Kirill Kravchenko told reporters in Belgrade
today. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell 24 percent to 27.9 billion dinars, he said.  “The main risk to our further investments is not the size
of sales or global oil prices, but the debt of our consumers,”
which more than doubled to 69.4 billion dinars, he said. NIS’s
top three claims are from monopoly Srbijagas JP, flag carrier
Jat Airways and chemical company Petrohemija AD, he said.  The Novi Sad, Serbia-based company plans annual investment
of 500 million euros through 2015, including in power
generation, oil exploration and expansion of its fuel retail in
the Balkans.  NIS may not meet its original investment target of 59
billion dinars for 2013, which is now seen between 55 billion
dinars and 57 billion dinars, Kravchenko said. Investments rose
40 percent from a year ago to 24 billion dinars in the first
half of 2013.  NIS plans to sign up a contractor in September to develop a
200 megawatt gas-fired power plant, worth at least 170 million
euros, in Pancevo next to its main refinery.  The company also plans to upgrade a smaller refinery in
Novi Sad by early 2016 to produce base oils and lubricants, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
