The ruble headed for its longest
losing streak since May and Russian bond yields rose on concern
falling oil prices will dent earnings for the world’s biggest
energy exporter.  The currency slid for a fourth day, dropping 0.4 percent to
37.2626 against the dollar-euro basket by 11:18 a.m. in Moscow.
The ruble depreciated 0.3 percent versus the dollar to 32.55 and
by 0.5 percent to the euro to 43.0225. The yield on the
government’s ruble bonds maturing February 2027 rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.68 percent after climbing
by the same yesterday.  Oil fell as much as 0.6 percent to $104.72 per barrel in
 New York  today, the second day of declines. The oil and natural-gas industries contribute about 50 percent of  Russia ’s budget
revenue. Russia’s central bank sold 6.47 billion rubles ($199
million) on July 23 to slow the currency’s drop, according to
its website.  “The ruble continues its slide because oil is trading
weaker,” Andrew Mishko, a foreign-exchange trader at OAO MDM
Bank in Moscow, said by phone.  Russia yesterday sold all 10 billion rubles offered of
government ruble bonds due in 2016 at a 6.21 percent average
yield and 7.49 billion rubles of a planned 10 billion rubles of
2023 notes at a 7.19 percent yield.  The ruble rallied last week as investors speculated that
the  Federal Reserve  will keep stimulus measures in place,
boosting appetite for riskier, emerging-market assets. Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told lawmakers last week that the
central bank’s $85 billion of monthly bond purchases “could be
reduced more quickly or expanded” depending on the pace of
recovery in the U.S.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Emerging Currencies Index was little
changed at 91.194.  To contact the reporter on this story:
