Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) ,
the nationâ€™s top copper producer, posted a worse-than-expected
22 percent decline in first-quarter profit after its only
smelter was ordered shut for polluting the atmosphere.  Group  net income  fell to 9.34 billion rupees ($158 million),
or 2.78 rupees a share, in the three months ended June 30 from
12 billion rupees, or 3.57 rupees, a year earlier, Sterlite said
today in a statement. The median profit of 23 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was 10.1 billion rupees. Sales at the
 Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  unit, based in the southern city of
Tuticorin, fell 23 percent to 81.9 billion rupees, against an
estimate of 68.8 billion rupees.  Sterlite, controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal, lost
revenue from its copper business after the pollution control
authority of the southern state of  Tamil Nadu  on March 30
ordered the closing of the smelter for emitting high quantities
of sulfur dioxide. Sterlite restarted the unit on June 23
following an order by the National Green Tribunal, the company
said in the statement.  Total expenses fell by a quarter to 68.3 billion rupees,
while fuel costs surged 9.5 percent to 12.2 billion rupees,
according to the statement. The company today won approval from
the  High Court  of Madras for a merger with Sesa Goa Ltd.,
another Vedanta group company, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
