U.S. employers added jobs in July
at about the same pace as in June, when they took on another
195,000 workers, data in the coming week are likely to show.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and fellow policy
makers probably will vote to continue the central bankâ€™s record
level of bond buying, and may wait until September to trim the
monthly amount from $85 billion. The European Central Bank is
likely to leave its benchmark rate at a record low of 0.5
percent. ECB President  Mario Draghi  will give a news conference.  Exxon Mobil Corp.,  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , Deutsche Bank
AG,  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and  Procter
& Gamble Co. (PG)  will be among companies releasing results.  Zimbabweans will elect a new government, with Robert Mugabe
seeking to extend his 33-year leadership of the country.  MONDAY, JULY 29  To contact the reporters on this story:
