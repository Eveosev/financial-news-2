Consumer confidence  rose last week
as an improving job market helped make Americans the least
pessimistic about the economy in more than five years.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort  Index (COMFCOMF)  improved to minus 27.3
in the seven days ended July 21, matching its highest level
since January 2008, from minus 28.4 the prior period. The
measure tracking perceptions about the world’s biggest economy
posted its biggest advance since September 2008.  Rising home and equity values this year have brightened
consumers’ moods, which may help propel spending following a
lull last quarter. The increase in confidence last week was
broad-based with six of seven income brackets showing gains,
indicating gains in employment are making households more
convinced the economic expansion will be sustained.  “What we’re seeing here is consumer sentiment continuing
to move in a tight range likely based on Americans’ perceptions
of growing job security,” said  Joseph Brusuelas , a senior
economist at Bloomberg LP in  New York .  Stocks fell, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  index declining
for a third day, as investors weighed corporate earnings. The
 S&P 500  declined 0.3 percent to 1,681.53 at 9:33 a.m. in New
York.  A report today showed the number of Americans who filed for
 unemployment benefits  rose last week as annual auto-plant
shutdowns continued to affect the data. Initial  jobless claims 
climbed by 7,000 to 343,000 in the period ended July 20, the
Labor Department said.  Durable Goods  Orders for  durable goods  climbed more than forecast in
June, another report from the Commerce Department showed.
Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years increased
4.2 percent, led by transportation equipment, after a revised
5.2 percent gain in May that was bigger than initially reported.
The median forecast of 79 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a 1.4 percent advance. Unfilled orders for big-ticket
goods rose the most since December 2007.  Americans showed increased confidence in the state of the
economy, with the  measure  reaching minus 50.5, the strongest
reading since January 2008, from minus 55.3 the period before.  Improved views on the economy “are key for further
advances in consumer sentiment, given that they’re so much
bleaker than ratings of personal finances or the buying
climate,”  Gary Langer , president of Langer Research Associates
LLC in New York, which produces the comfort data for Bloomberg,
said in a statement.  Personal Finances  A measure of  personal finances  increased to 4.3 from 3.6
the week before, leaving the gauge 6.5 points below its long-term average since 1985. An index of  buying conditions  eased to
minus 35.8 last week from minus 33.5.  An improving employment picture and historically low
borrowing costs are supporting U.S. home sales, boosting
consumers’ perception of their wealth as home values rise.  Purchases of new houses climbed 8.3 percent to an
annualized pace of 497,000 homes, the highest level since May
2008, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The median selling
price of a new home appreciated 7.4 percent to $249,700 last
month from $232,600 in June 2012.  Positive trends in the housing market are translating into
gains for companies such as  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) , the world’s largest
appliance maker, which raised its earnings forecast for the year
amid expectations for better growth in the industry.  Demand Improving  “We see demand for replacement purchases as well as
improving consumer confidence,” Marc Bitzer, president of
Whirlpool  North America , said in a July 19 conference call to
discuss second quarter earnings. “Therefore, we expect
continued growth as we progress throughout the year.”  Rising mortgage rates and increasing gas prices may temper
future gains in consumer sentiment. Mortgage applications in the
U.S. fell for a sixth straight week in the period ended July 19,
the Mortgage Bankers Association index showed yesterday, while
the cost of a gallon of  regular gasoline  averaged $3.67 on July
21, near the highest level in four months, according to figures
from AAA, the largest U.S. motoring group.  Confidence among men rose to minus 16.6 last week, its
highest since January 2008, from minus 20.7, according to
today’s report. Sentiment among  women  declined to minus 37.3,
the worst reading since April, from minus 35.6 in the prior
period.  The  disparity  between the sexes matched its widest since
the last week of 2011, and may reflect what has been a widening
income gap in the comfort index as median incomes for women tend
to be lower than for men, Langer said.  Income Groups  For households earning more the $100,000, the index was
positive for a 25th straight week, rising to 18.8 from 14.9 in
the prior week. The measure for households earning less than
$15,000 improved to minus 66.2 from minus 69.2 a week earlier,
its worst reading since January. Those making from $75,000 to
$99,900 were the only ones to lose confidence last week.  Comfort among married adults last week was the strongest
since January 2008, with the reading rising to minus 17.6 from
minus 20.4. The index for  renters  improved to minus 36 from
minus 40.2 the week before.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index conducts telephone
surveys with a random sample of 1,000 consumers ages 18 and
older. Each week, 250 respondents are asked for their views on
the  U.S. economy , personal finances and buying climate. The
percentage of negative responses is subtracted from the share of
positive views and divided by three. The most recent reading is
based on the average of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
