Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , Dubai’s
biggest developer, is seeking to change the terms of a 3.6
billion-dirham ($980 million) loan secured by its Dubai Mall
after the company’s credit ratings improved.  Emaar “requested our banking partners to review the
terms” of the loan, the builder of the world’s tallest tower
said in an e-mailed statement today without being specific.
“This follows our improved credit profile.”  The company is seeking to cut the  interest rate  on the loan
to 175 basis points over the London interbank offered rate from
350 bps, MEED reported on July 24. Emaar didn’t confirm those
figures or say it seeks a lower rate.  Standard & Poor’s  raised Emaar one level to BB+, its
highest non-investment, or junk, grade on April 25, saying
recurring revenue and new projects will lift income. Emaar’s
2019 Islamic bond yield is poised for the biggest drop in six
months, compared with an average rise among its regional peers.  When Emaar obtained the loan in December 2011, using the
world’s biggest shopping mall by area as collateral, the company
said it would use it to  repay  a $300 million facility taken in
2010 and draw down the rest in 2012. Half of the Islamic and
conventional facility will be repaid in five years, while the
rest will be amortized over eight years, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
