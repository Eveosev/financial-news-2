ING U.S. Inc. (VOYA) , the insurer that had
an initial public offering in May, will stop sponsoring the  New
York  City Marathon after 2013 as it moves away from Dutch owner
 ING Groep NV. (INGA)   The firm reviewed its sponsorship strategy as it will start
re-branding to Voya Financial Inc. in 2014, Raymond Vermeulen, a
spokesman for Amsterdam-based ING Groep, said by telephone
today. New York-based ING U.S. will focus on supporting
financial literacy and has decided to end distance-running
sponsorships, including races in Miami and Hartford, he said.  ING has sponsored the  New York City Marathon  since 2003.
About 48,000 people will run in New York on Nov. 3, the race
organizer  New York Road Runners  said in a statement on May 29,
making it the year’s biggest marathon. Last year’s event was
canceled after  Hurricane Sandy  amid concern it would drain
recovery resources and offend those affected by the storm.
Vermeulen declined to comment on the cost of the sponsorship.  The company sold a 25 percent stake in its U.S. insurer in
May, raising about $1.27 billion as it  divests assets  to meet
with European Union conditions imposed after the firm received
state aid in 2008 and 2009. ING Groep’s stake in the U.S.
insurer dropped to 71 percent after it sold additional shares to
the underwriters of the IPO. The stock, sold at $19.50 a piece,
closed at $30.40 in New York trading yesterday.  ING’s marathon plans were reported on Tuesday by the
SportsBusiness Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
