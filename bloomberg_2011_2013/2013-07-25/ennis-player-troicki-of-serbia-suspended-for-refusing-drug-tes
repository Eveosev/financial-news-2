Tennis player  Viktor Troicki  of
Serbia, who rose to as high as No. 12 in the men’s world
rankings in 2011 and reached the fourth round of this year’s
French Open, was suspended for 18 months for refusing to provide
a blood sample for a drug test.  Troicki, 27, currently is ranked 53rd in the world. He lost
yesterday in the second round of a tournament in Umag, Croatia.  The  International Tennis Federation  announced the sanction
yesterday in an e-mailed release and said Troicki will not be
eligible to return to competition until Jan. 24, 2015.  The ITF said Troicki was selected to provide urine and
blood samples on April 15 during a tournament in  Monte Carlo . He
provided the urine sample and refused to give blood because he
did not feel well that day, the ITF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
