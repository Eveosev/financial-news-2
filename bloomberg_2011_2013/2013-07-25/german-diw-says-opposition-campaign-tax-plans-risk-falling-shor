German chancellor candidate  Peer Steinbrueck ’s plans to raise taxes for the wealthy risk
backfiring, the DIW economic institute  said .  The Social Democratic former finance minister’s campaign
pledge to increase the  tax rate  on incomes above 64,000 euros
($84,600) would reap 6.5 billion euros if taxpayers accept the
measure, the Berlin-based DIW said in a report today. That could
shrink to as little as 2 billion euros if taxpayers make full
use of legal loopholes to circumvent the increase, it said.  “It is expected that taxpayers will change their behavior
as a result of tariff reforms and will try for example to avoid
an increase in the marginal tax rate,” the DIW said. Efforts to
dodge additional levies “are likely due to tax structuring, for
which high earners have many options,” it said.  Tax policy  is emerging is a key campaign battleground for
Sept. 22 federal elections that will determine whether
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  secures a third term. While the main
opposition SPD and their Green party allies both plan to raise
the top tax rate in a bid to bolster social justice, Merkel and
her Free Democratic coalition partner rule out tax increases.  Steinbrueck’s SPD aims to raise the top tax rate to 49
percent from 42 percent progressively from 64,000 euros to
100,000 euros, whereby those earning 100,000 euros or more per
year would pay 49 percent income tax. The Greens want a 49
percent top tax rate from 80,000 euros a year, with a 45 percent
rate kicking in from 60,000 euros. The current top rate of 42
percent applies at about 53,000 euros.  Reduced ‘Noticeably’  Still, the proposal by the Greens, Steinbrueck’s favored
coalition partner, may reap as little as 1.6 billion euros
instead of the 7.5 billion euros the party aims to generate,
according to the DIW, since “adjustments by taxpayers could
reduce the volume noticeably.”  Merkel’s coalition promise to reduce the effects of
“bracket creep” that occurs when workers move into higher tax
codes would lead to a revenue loss of as much as 3.7 billion
euros, the institute said. Plans by the anti-capitalist Left
Party for “broad” tax relief coupled with a “large increase”
to 53 percent from 65,000 euros would cause a loss of as much 30
billion euros, it said.  The  Social Democrats  trail Merkel’s CDU/CSU bloc by as many
as 19 percentage points in opinion polls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
