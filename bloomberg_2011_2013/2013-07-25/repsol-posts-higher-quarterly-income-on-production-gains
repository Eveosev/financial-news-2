Repsol SA (REP) , Spain’s largest oil
producer, reported an increase in second-quarter earnings on
production gains as new projects started up.  CCS  net income  rose to 423 million euros ($559 million)
from 406 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based company
said today in a  statement . That fell short of the 431 million-euro average estimate of  17 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.  Repsol, which has ramped up exploration efforts in  Latin
America  and  North America  to offset the loss of its Argentine
YPF SA unit, said production rose 12 percent from a year
earlier. It cited project startups and reduced maintenance
shutdowns in  Trinidad and Tobago  for the increase.  “Repsol’s volume growth was driven by the startup of five
of the company’s 10 key upstream projects,” said Oswald Clint,
a London-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  Refining profit slipped 32 percent to 138 million euros
because of lower margins and a deterioration in differentials
between light and heavy crudes. The refining margin fell to $2.6
a barrel from $4.7 a barrel a year earlier.  “The miss was due to a higher than expected tax rate of 45
percent as well as lower than expected income from associates,”
said  Peter Hutton , an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in London.  The shares were 0.2 percent lower at 17.31 euros as of
10:12 a.m. in Madrid trading. The stock is up 13 percent so far
this year.  Repsol’s liquefied natural gas division, most of which it
sold to Royal Dutch Shell Plc in February for $4.4 billion,
reported profit more than doubled to 170 million euros on
improved volumes and margins. The transaction is due to be
completed in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
