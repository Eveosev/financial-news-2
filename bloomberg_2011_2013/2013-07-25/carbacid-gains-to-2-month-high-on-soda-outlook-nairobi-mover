Carbacid Investments Ltd., a Kenyan
carbon-dioxide maker, gained for the first time in six days as
rising output and consumption of soft drinks in  East Africa ’s
drives expectations for higher earnings.  The shares climbed 5 shillings, or 3.6 percent, to 145
shillings by the close in Nairobi, the highest since May 20.
More than 24 times the three-month daily average volume of
shares were traded.  In the first quarter of 2013,  Kenya ’s soft-drink production
rose 6.6 percent to 109.7 million liters,  according to  the
country’s statistics agency. The economy is forecast to expand 6
percent this year, the fastest pace in six years, compared with
4.6 percent in 2012.  “Investors are anticipating strong full year earnings
because the soft drinks sector is growing strongly,”  Aly-Khan Satchu , chief executive officer of Rich Management Ltd., a
Nairobi-based adviser to companies and high net-worth
individuals, said by phone. “Soft drinks are highly correlated
to the economy so as the economy grows faster and the middle
class expands we have more people consuming soft drinks,”
Satchu said.  The company is “already trading at a discount to the
market,” he said. Carbacid has a price-to-earnings ratio of
12.7, compared with 14.3 for the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All
Share Index. (NSEASI)  Net income in the first half through January rose
51 percent to 264.2 million shillings ($3 million) , it said in
March. Sales jumped 15 percent to 546.7 million shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
