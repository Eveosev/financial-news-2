Copper declined for the first time
in six days after manufacturing in  China , the biggest user,
weakened and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said a global surplus may
almost double in two years. Aluminum, lead and nickel dropped.  Metal for delivery in three months fell as much as 1
percent, the most since July 17, to $6,984.25 a metric ton on
the London Metal Exchange and was at $7,018.50 by 11:17 a.m. in
 Shanghai . Nickel dropped 1 percent to $14,230 a ton and aluminum
declined 0.5 percent to $1,841 a ton.  Goldman said the copper surplus may rise to 500,000 tons in
2015 from 257,000 tons this year in a report yesterday. China’s
manufacturing weakened further in July, according to a
preliminary index released yesterday by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics.  “Copper may continue to be trapped in a narrow range,
while any further dip may attract buying,” said Zhang Tianfeng,
an analyst at Dongxing Futures Co. in Shanghai. “There’s no
support from actual demand.”  Metal for delivery in November on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.4 percent to 50,310  yuan  ($8,196) a ton. Copper
for delivery in September on the Comex was little changed at
$3.1750 a pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
