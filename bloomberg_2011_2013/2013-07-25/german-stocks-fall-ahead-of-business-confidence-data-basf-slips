German stocks  declined the most in
almost three weeks as  Siemens AG (SIE)  said it will miss its margin
target and  BASF SE (BAS)  posted profit that missed estimates.  Siemens tumbled the most in almost two years after  Europe ’s
largest engineering company said it will miss a profit-margin
forecast. BASF slid 4.5 percent as the world’s largest chemical
company also said meeting annual targets looks more difficult
than at the start of the year.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  lost 1.6 percent
after a report that Germany’s second-biggest bank lent the
bankrupt city of  Detroit  more than $400 million.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  retreated 1 percent to 8,298.98 at the close
in  Frankfurt , the biggest decline since July 5. The broader HDAX
Index dropped 0.7 percent today.  “We had some bad outlooks from companies causing the
market to trade lower,” Christian Schmidt, a market analyst at
Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in Frankfurt, said by phone.
“Most of the positive news is priced in. Companies have to
bring out further improvements and economic data needs to show
further improvements to underline the prices we have now.”  The DAX has rallied 9 percent this year amid speculation
global central banks will maintain stimulus measures. The
benchmark gauge for German equities climbed 0.8 percent
yesterday, halting a three-day decline, after reports indicated
German manufacturing rebounded and service industries expanded
at a faster-than-expected pace.  Confidence Climbs  Equities fell even as  Germany ’s  business confidence  rose
for a third month in July. The Ifo institute’s business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 106.2
from 105.9 in June and was in line with the 106.1 median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the DAX today was 3.8 percent higher than the average of the
past 30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Siemens sank 6 percent to 78.62 euros, the largest drop
since August 2011. The company said it no longer expects to
achieve the profit margin of at least 12 percent for fiscal 2014
due to “lower market expectations.” Siemens is due to report
third-quarter earnings on Aug. 1.  BASF sank 4.5 percent to 66.74 euros for the biggest drop
in five months. Second-quarter  earnings  before interest, taxes
and one-time items fell 5.4 percent to 1.83 billion euros ($2.42
billion), trailing the 1.99 billion-euro average estimate of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Smaller rival  Lanxess AG (LXS)  declined 2.8 percent to 46.73
euros, the biggest drop in three weeks.  Commerzbank Drops  Commerzbank fell 1.6 percent to 6.74 euros, snapping a
five-day rally. The lender has more exposure to Detroit than
Hypo Real Estate Bank or Dexia Bank,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported, without saying where it got the information.  Commerzbank wrote down the value of a portfolio of credit
extended to the city, Armin Guhl, a spokesman for the lender,
said by phone. He declined to comment on the composition of the
portfolio or the timing and size of writedowns.  Software AG (SOW)  plunged 8.1 percent to 23.66 euros, the biggest
drop in almost six months. The second-largest software maker in
Germany posted second-quarter revenue of 237.7 million euros,
falling short of the 245.8 million euros forecast by analysts.  Axel Springer AG (SPR)  jumped 17 percent to 40.34 euros after
agreeing to sell publications to Funke Mediengruppe GmbH for 920
million euros. That was the biggest advance for Europe’s biggest
newspaper publisher since January 1999.  Wincor Nixdorf AG added 4.3 percent to 46.14 euros, the
highest since July 2011. Europe’s biggest maker of automated
teller machines posted third-quarter revenue of 575 million
euros, surpassing sales of 567.2 million estimated by analysts
on average, and raised its full-year forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
