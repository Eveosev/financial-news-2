Technip SA (TEC) , Europe’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, reported a 19 percent increase in
second-quarter profit and said oil and natural gas companies
continue to start new projects.  Net income  rose to 162.4 million euros ($214 million) in
the period from 136 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said in a statement. Technip, which maintained its
full-year financial targets, plans to complete about 4 billion
euros of projects by the end of the year.  “We have not seen any meaningful change in our clients’
drive to sanction projects in the last few months,” Chief
Executive Officer Thierry Pilenko said today in a statement.  Technip, which supplies pipes, platforms and equipment to
the oil and gas industry, has said spending plans by  oil
companies  remain “robust” even as some projects in the  Gulf of
Mexico  and  Australia  have been delayed on costs. The company is
seeking to develop petrochemical factories in the U.S. to profit
from the shale boom.  Technip’s contract backlog reached a record at 15.2 billion
euros at the end of the latest quarter, according to today’s
statement. It kept a target to increase revenue as much as 16
percent to 9.5 billion euros this year.  The company said it expects the operating margin in its
subsea division to hold steady at about 15 percent this year,
while the onshore-offshore margin will be 6 percent to 7 percent,
compared with 7 percent in 2012.
