3M Co. (MMM) , the maker of car fuel-system
cleaners to dental braces, posted second-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates on lower taxes and higher demand for
health-care and auto products.  Net income  rose 2.6 percent to $1.2 billion, or $1.71 a
share, from $1.17 billion, or $1.66, a year earlier, the  St.
Paul , Minnesota-based company said today in a statement. The
average estimate was $1.70, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. 3M said a lower  tax rate  added 6 cents a share to
earnings, and its operating profit margin fell.  The company, which generated only 35 percent of its  revenue 
in the U.S. last year, has found growth in  Latin America  for
health-care products and in its home market for auto goods. 3M
has struggled to boost sales and profit amid a recession in
Europe and a slowdown in China’s economic expansion.  “This second-quarter report should bolster the perception
of 3M as a company that can execute consistently in the current
highly variable global economic environment,”  Nick Heymann , a
New York-based analyst at William Blair & Co., wrote in a note.
He has a market perform rating on 3M.  Sales rose 2.9 percent to $7.75 billion, trailing the
$7.77 billion average analyst estimate. Revenue fell 3.2 percent
in the Electronics and Energy unit, rose 4.6 percent for Health
Care and climbed 6.6 percent for Industrial, 3M said.  “We continue to grow our sales, profits and free  cash flow 
in the face of a continued slow-growth economy and a strong  U.S.
dollar ,” Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin told analysts and
investors on a conference call.  Narrower Margin  3M reported a second-quarter operating margin, a measure of
income to sales, of 22 percent, down from 22.9 percent a year
earlier. That was lower than estimates, Steve Tusa, a JPMorgan &
Chase Co. analyst in  New York , wrote in a note today. Margins
were hurt by exchange rates, especially a weaker yen against the
dollar, acquisitions and lower factory utilization, 3M said.  “Sales were in line, with the miss coming from margins,”
said Tusa, who rates the stock underweight. The company said
currency rates trimmed sales by 1.3 percent from a year earlier.  The  shares  rose 0.2 percent to $116.55 at the close in
New York. 3M has gained 26 percent this year, outpacing the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s 19 percent gain.  3M reiterated its 2013 earnings forecast of $6.60 to $6.85
a share, which it reduced in April from $6.70 to $6.95. The
company also kept its forecast for organic local-currency sales
growth at 2 percent to 5 percent this year. 3M doesn’t provide
quarterly outlooks.  ‘Moderate Growth’  “By and large, I would call it an in-line quarter,”  Matt Arnold , an Edward Jones & Co. analyst in  St. Louis  who  has a
buy rating on the stock, said in a telephone interview. “It
looks an awful lot like the first quarter with pretty moderate
growth across the portfolio.”  The company raised its planned 2013 stock buybacks to a
range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, a $1.5 billion increase
to both ends of its earlier forecast. Buybacks during the second
quarter totaled $1.2 billion, 3M said. The company had reported
repurchases of $805 million in the year’s first three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
