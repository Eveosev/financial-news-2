Visa Inc. (V)  gained the most since May
after reporting fiscal third-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates as consumers stepped up use of credit and debit cards.  Visa rose 4.6 percent to $195.33 at 10 a.m. in  New York ,
the second-best performer on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Information Technology Index. The shares gained 29 percent this
year, outpacing the 9.4 percent advance of the 70-company index.  Net income  for the three months ended June 30 was $1.23
billion, or $1.88 a share, compared with a loss of $1.84
billion, or $2.74, a year earlier that included a litigation
expense, the  Foster City , California-based firm said yesterday
in a statement. The average  estimate  of 33 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.80 a share. Profit excluding
special items from the third quarter of 2012 climbed 16 percent.  Chief Executive Officer  Charlie Scharf  is seeking to
bolster Visa’s business outside the U.S., where it gets more
than half its revenue, as consumers worldwide continue to
migrate from cash and checks to electronic payments. The company
has returned more than $15 billion to shareholders since 2008.  “The opportunity to move transactions from cash to
electronic means is still huge,” Scharf, 48, said yesterday in
a conference call with analysts. “This is true in both the
developed and the developing parts of the world.”  Share Repurchases  The company repurchased $981 million of its stock during
the quarter at an average of $176.75 a share and may buy back an
additional $1.5 billion through next July, according to the
statement.  Third-quarter operating revenue climbed 17 percent to $3
billion, beating the $2.89 billion average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue will increase about 13 percent
this fiscal year, according to the statement. Earnings per share
will rise by more than 20 percent, the company said, after an
earlier forecast of “around” 20 percent.  Worldwide spending on Visa cards climbed 13 percent to
$1.09 trillion, adjusted for currency fluctuations, according to
the statement. Processed transactions rose 14 percent to 15
billion. Cross-border purchases, or spending by cardholders
outside their home countries, advanced 11 percent.  In the U.S., debit-card purchases advanced 12 percent to
$300 billion, and credit-card spending increased 10 percent to
$270 billion, according to the statement.  Legal Settlement  Visa and No. 2 network  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  agreed last year to
a $7.25 billion settlement over the fees charged to merchants
when consumers pay with credit cards. Visa sued Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. last month to stop the biggest U.S. retailer from filing a
lawsuit that would prolong the eight-year legal battle the
settlement seeks to end.  American Express Co. (AXP) , the New York-based card issuer that
also runs the third-largest U.S. bank-card network, said July 18
that second-quarter profit rose 4.9 percent to $1.41 billion as
customer purchases increased. Riverwoods, Illinois-based
 Discover Financial Services (DFS) , the No. 4 network, said yesterday
that quarterly net income climbed 15 percent to $602 million.
MasterCard is set to report results July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
