Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  traded near a three-month high after Chinese Premier  Li Keqiang  said the nation will accelerate railway construction in
central and western regions to spur growth.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 3,692  yuan  ($602) a metric ton at
10:56 a.m. local time. The contract rose 4.4 percent this month,
touching 3,712 yuan on July 19, the highest since April 22.  China  is planning a railway development fund, according to
a statement from the State Council yesterday after a meeting led
by Li. The country had planned to invest 520 billion yuan in
railway construction this year, according to a rail-bond
 prospectus  published July 19. The government also approved tax
breaks for small companies and reduced fees for exporters,
according to the State Council.  “Demand for steel, both from infrastructure building and
real estate development, is pretty good,” Wu Zhili, an analyst
at Shenhua Futures Co., said from Shenzhen. The development fund
is expected to spur large-scale rail projects, which consume
steel, he said.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port rose 0.2
percent to $132.10 a ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index
Ltd. The average  spot price  for rebar gained 0.2 percent to
3,463 yuan yesterday, the highest since May, according to data
from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
