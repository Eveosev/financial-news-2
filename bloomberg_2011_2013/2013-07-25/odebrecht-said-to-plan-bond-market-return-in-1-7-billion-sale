Odebrecht SA, the Brazilian
construction and engineering firm, set the expected yield on its
$1.7 billion of bonds at 6.75 percent.  The company, which postponed an offering last month,
intends to sell debt maturing October 2022 through its Odebrecht
Offshore Drilling Finance unit, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction who asked not to be identified
because terms aren’t set. The bonds may be rated Baa3 at Moody’s
Investors Service, the person said.  Odebrecht is returning to the  bond market  after the earlier
transaction was delayed by market conditions. The unit had
proposed $1.9 billion of similar-maturity secured bonds that
were preliminarily rated BBB by  Standard & Poor’s , according to
a June 11 report.  Average yields on similarly rated corporate securities in
the U.S., which had surged more than a percentage point from a
record-low 3.18 percent in May to 4.2 percent on July 5, have
since retreated to 3.94 percent, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
