All-Star second baseman  Dustin Pedroia  went 0-for-4 hours after he signed an eight-year
contract extension with the  Boston Red Sox  that will take him
through the 2021 season.  The team declined to disclose financial arrangements. The
deal is worth $110 million to Pedroia, who was drafted by the
Red Sox, according to MLB.com.  “I just want to make sure I’m playing my last game here.
That’s important,” he said yesterday during a press conference.
“It’s the only thing I know. I love putting on the Red Sox
uniform every day. Every game is important to me and my
teammates. It’s pretty special.”  The American League East-leading Red Sox (61-42) lost 5-1
last night to the second-place Tampa Bay Rays (60-42), who have
crept up to within one-half game of Boston.  Pedroia, 29, joined  Willie Mays , Frank Robinson,  Pete Rose ,
Johnny Bench, Thurman Munson, Cal Ripken Jr., and  Albert Pujols 
as the only players to have won a World Series and Rookie of the
Year, Most Valuable Player and Rawlings Gold Glove awards, the
Major League Baseball team said.  “Dustin’s numbers are great, but they don’t tell you how
committed he is to winning,” said manager John Farrell on the
team’s website. “Watch him every day, on the field and in the
clubhouse, and you see exceptional skill and passion.”  This season, Pedroia has hit .306 with 25 doubles, one
triple, six home runs and 58 runs batted in during 101 games. In
957 major league games, he has hit .303 with 270 doubles, 12
triples, 96 home runs, 618 runs and 467 RBIs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
