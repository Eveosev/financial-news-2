China will offer a subsidy of 0.42
 yuan  (7 cents) a kilowatt-hour for distributed solar-power pilot
projects, the National Business Daily reported.  A list of pilot zones will be determined by July 20, the
report said, citing Meng Xiangan, vice chairman of the China
Renewable Energy Society. Two calls to the news department of
the National Energy Administration went unanswered.  Such projects would have less than 6 megawatts of capacity
and would be connected to grids with voltage of as much as 10
kilovolts, the official China National Radio reported Oct. 26,
citing China State Grid Corp.  China offers 1 yuan a kilowatt-hour for power generated
from solar farms, except in  Tibet , according to preferential
prices set in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
