France  will likely miss a goal for
renewables to make up 23 percent of energy consumption by 2020
unless power users stump up billions of euros, according to the
state auditor.  French electricity consumers would have to contribute 40.5
billion euros ($54 billion) from 2012 to 2020 toward the
development of  wind turbines  and solar panels among renewables
to meet the plan, the  Cours des Comptes  said today in a report.
The 2020 target “will be difficult to reach,” the report said.  France, which gets about three-quarters of its electricity
output from nuclear reactors -- a higher proportion than any
other country -- is in the midst of a debate about future  energy
policy . President  Francois Hollande  has pledged to lower
dependance on atomic output while keeping down energy costs for
consumers.  The increasing costs of developing renewable energy
“raises questions about its sustainability over the long-term”
and benefits in terms of jobs for local industries, the auditor
said today. The acceptance of renewables by the French
population is “often problematic.”  Subsidies to renewables reached 14.3 billion euros from
2005 and 2011, of which 3.3 billion euros was paid by power
consumers through a tax on bills, the report said. The spending
raised renewables to 13 percent of French energy demand in 2011.  The auditor recommended policy changes including more
transparency on costs, jobs and energy markets as well as
revising the system whereby subsidies come from power consumers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
