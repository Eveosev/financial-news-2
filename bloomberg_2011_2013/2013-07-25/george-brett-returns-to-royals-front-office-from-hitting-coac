Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett is stepping down as hitting coach of the  Kansas City
Royals  and returning to the Major League Baseball team’s front
office.  Brett, 60, will resume his position as vice president of
baseball operations after working two months as interim hitting
coach, the team announced today in an e-mailed release. He will
be replaced in the dugout by Pedro Grifol.  “George did an incredible job,” Royals General Manager
Dayton Moore said today in the release. “His expertise as a
baseball man and his passion to win will have an everlasting
effect on our team. I’m thrilled that he will be more involved
in all aspects of baseball operations.”  The Royals’ team batting average is .255, eighth in the 15-team American League. Their 64 home runs are the fewest in the
league.  A 13-time All-Star, Brett hit .305 with 317 home runs and
1,583 runs scored in a 21-year career spent entirely with the
Royals. He was voted the  American League ’s Most Valuable player
in 1980, led the team to a World Series title in 1985 and was
elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999.  -- Editors: Rob Gloster, Michael Sillup  To contact the reporters on this story:
