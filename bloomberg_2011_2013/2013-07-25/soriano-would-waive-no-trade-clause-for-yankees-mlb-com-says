Alfonso Soriano  told the Chicago
Cubs that he’s willing to waive his no-trade clause to join the
 New York Yankees , MLB.com reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Soriano, 37, met last night with  Theo Epstein , the Cubs’
president of baseball operations, and listed the teams for which
he would give up his no-trade clause, the website said. Major
League Baseball’s trade deadline is July 31.  Outfielder Soriano, who wasn’t in tonight’s starting lineup
to play the Arizona Diamondbacks, signed an eight-year, $136
million contract before the 2007 season, MLB.com said. The deal
extends through next year when the pitcher will earn $18 million.  Soriano is batting .254 this season with 17 home runs and
51 runs batted in. During his 15-year career, which began in
1999 with the Yankees, he has a .272 batting average with 389
home runs and 1,086 RBIs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
