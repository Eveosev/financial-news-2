A case of Pavillon Rouge 2010, the
second wine of Bordeaux estate Chateau Margaux, sold for 925
pounds ($1,415) on Liv-ex, its lowest level for more than four
months, amid muted demand for vintages from the region.  The transaction yesterday was 10 percent down from the
1,030 pounds at which it traded in May and 38 percent below the
record 1,490 pounds paid in June 2011 as it was released to the
market.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 4 percent this
year, with gains in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared by a drop
since then. The index, a benchmark for top wines from Bordeaux,
is currently heading for its fourth straight month of declines.  “The region has been releasing wines at too high a price
for too long, and is now paying the price,” Liv-ex said in a
commentary on its market blog.  The 2010 vintage of Pavillon Rouge is the most expensive of
the past five years, according to merchant prices collated by
 Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website.  The wine was awarded a 94 rating on a 100-point scale by
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , making it the highest-ranked Pavillon
Rouge of the past decade, according to the eRobertParker.com
 website .  Second Wine  Margaux has been producing a second wine since the
nineteenth century, and the current name Pavillon Rouge du
Chateau Margaux dates back to 1908, according to Margaux’s
website. Production lapsed in the 1930s and resumed when Andre
Mentzelopoulos bought the estate in 1977. His daughter Corinne
now runs the business.  Pavillon Rouge is produced from wine that isn’t retained
for the main  Chateau Margaux  brand during the blending process.
It is frequently made from younger vines and bottled three or
four months sooner than the main wine for earlier drinking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
