LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) ,
the world’s largest luxury-goods maker, reported first-half
profit growth that slightly trailed analysts’ estimates and said
it’s confident for the second six months of the year.  Profit from recurring operations climbed 2 percent to 2.71
billion euros ($3.6 billion), Paris-based LVMH said today in a
statement. Analysts predicted 2.76 billion euros, according to
the average  estimate  compiled by Bloomberg. First-half sales
advanced 5.6 percent to 13.7 billion euros, or 8 percent
excluding currency shifts and acquisitions.  LVMH, which this month agreed to pay 2 billion euros for 80
percent of Italian cashmere clothier Loro Piana SpA, is raising
prices and slowing retail expansion at  Louis Vuitton  in a bid to
keep customers interested in its biggest and most profitable
brand. LVMH’s comparable fashion and leather-goods sales
advanced 5 percent in the first half, accelerating from a 3
percent gain in the opening quarter, it said.  “It is with confidence that we approach the second half of
the year,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Bernard Arnault 
said in the statement.  LVMH was unchanged at 130.40 euros in Paris trading today.
The earnings were released after European markets closed.  Hermes International SCA (RMS) , in which LVMH has a stake, this
month reported a 16 percent increase in quarterly revenue,
excluding currency swings, as sales of its Kelly handbags and
other goods surged in Asia and the Americas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
