Rubber in  Tokyo  swung between gains
and losses as Japan’s currency breaching 100 per dollar raised
the appeal of yen-based contracts, while a slump in oil weakened
speculation prices of rival synthetic products will increase.  Rubber for delivery in December was little changed at 256.9
yen a kilogram ($2,564 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange at 10:22 a.m. after trading between 256.2 yen and 261.4
yen. Futures have gained 8.7 percent this month, paring this
year’s losses to 15 percent.  The yen slipped to 100.46 per dollar after data showed new
home sales in the U.S. rose more than forecast in June to a
five-year high and a manufacturing gauge rose. Crude oil futures
in  New York  dropped the most in more than a month yesterday as
U.S. output surged to a 22-year high last week. West Texas
Intermediate crude lost 0.3 percent to $105.07 a barrel at 9:46
a.m. Tokyo time, falling for a second day.  “Futures lost steam as a rally in oil took a breather,”
said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.
“The focus is now on whether U.S. economic data will add to
evidence for the nation’s recovery and weaken the yen further
against the dollar.”  The number of people in the U.S. continuing to claim
jobless benefits fell by 89,000 in the week to July 13,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists before data due
today. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has said asset
purchases that have stoked bond and equity gains may be trimmed
this year should economic risks subside.  Rubber for January delivery fell 0.7 percent to 18,455  yuan 
($3,007) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange yesterday. Thai
rubber free-on-board dropped 0.4 percent to 79.05 baht ($2.54) a
kilogram yesterday, according to Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
