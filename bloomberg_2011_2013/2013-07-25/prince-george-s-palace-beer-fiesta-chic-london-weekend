Prince George’s palace,  Daniel Radcliffe ’s new role, a beer festival in the Olympic Park, and Chic are our choices for  London  this weekend.  STAGE  In “The Cripple of Inishmaan” -- set in 1934 on a distant Irish island -- Radcliffe  plays a young man  with contorted limbs who hears an American film crew is hiring extras in a nearby village. It’s a chance for him to boost his fortunes and escape the locals’ constant taunts. Soon, he finds himself a love interest, too: the no-nonsense, dirty-mouthed Helen.  Director  Michael Grandage  brings the right mix of pathos and laughter to the play, and there are handsome revolving sets of gray stone. Through Aug. 31 at the Noel Coward Theatre:  http://www.michaelgrandagecompany.com  or +44-844-482-5140.  DINING  Casse-Croute is a tiny French bistro that just opened on Bermondsey Street, a stretch of road that’s becoming a destination for diners.

VISUAL ARTS  Visit the home of the newborn royal baby George -- and size up his grandma’s wardrobe.  Kensington Palace (the museum side of it) is showing dresses worn in the 1980s by the late  Princess Diana . Featuring beads, dropped waists and the odd bow, they’re not her prettiest outfits. For a better glimpse of her style, watch the video.
