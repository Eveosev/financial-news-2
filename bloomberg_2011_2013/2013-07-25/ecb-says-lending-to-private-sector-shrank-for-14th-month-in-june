Lending  to companies and households
in the 17-member euro area fell the most on record in June in a
sign the region is still struggling to shake off its longest-ever recession.  Loans to the private sector dropped 1.6 percent from a year
earlier, the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank said today.
That’s the 14th monthly decline and the biggest since the start
of the single currency in 1999.  “The weak economy is still weighing on demand for loans
and the ECB needs to figure out how to support that,” said
Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in
 London . “There are still substantial reasons for the ECB to
maintain the current accomodative stance.”  ECB President Mario Draghi pledged last month to keep
interest rates low for an extended period of time amid a subdued
economic outlook and “weaker and weaker” credit flows. While
euro-area banks loosened credit standards for loans to consumers
in the three months ended June for the first time since the end
of 2007, they continued to tighten them for corporate and home
loans, an ECB report showed yesterday.  The rate of growth in M3  money supply , which the ECB uses
as an indicator for future inflation, fell to 2.3 percent in
June from 2.9 percent in May, according to today’s data. That’s
below all 30  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  M3 grew 2.8 percent in past three months from the same
period a year earlier. M3 is the broadest gauge of money supply
and includes cash in circulation, some forms of savings and
money-market holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
