Cattle futures fell to a two-week
low on signs of ebbing U.S. demand for beef amid declining
exports. Hog prices also dropped.  In the week ended July 18, export sales of beef were 14,881
metric tons (32.8 million pounds), down 15 percent from the
four-week average, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Yesterday, the wholesale  price  fell 1.1 percent to $1.8689 a
pound, the lowest since Feb. 28, according to government
figures.  “Exports sales tailing off hasn’t helped the cattle
market,” Dick Quiter, an account executive at McFarland
Commodities LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.
Domestic “movement is slow,” he said.  Cattle futures for October delivery slumped 0.6 percent to
$1.24875 a pound at 10:43 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price touched $1.2455, the lowest for a
most-active contract since July 9.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement declined 0.6
percent to $1.52125 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.3 percent to
86.35 cents a pound. The price climbed in the previous three
days, the longest rally in six weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
