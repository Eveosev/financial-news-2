Germany ’s bonds fell, with 10-year
yields climbing to the highest level in two weeks, as an
increase in business confidence in Europe’s largest economy
damped demand for the region’s safest assets.  German securities underperformed most of their euro-area
peers, including those from Belgium and  France . Spanish bonds
rose for a second day after a report showed the unemployment
rate declined in the second quarter. German bunds tumbled
yesterday as data showed manufacturing in the euro area
unexpectedly expanded this month.  “There’s this broadly risk-on tone in the wake of recent
firm data,” said Richard McGuire, a fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank International in London. “It’s seen a modest degree of
pressure on safe havens such as bunds and Treasuries.”  Germany’s 10-year  yield  rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.68 percent at 4:55 p.m.  London  time after
climbing to 1.69 percent, the highest since July 9. The 1.5
percent bond due in May 2023 fell 0.26, or 2.60 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,323) face amount, to 98.43. The yield jumped 10 basis
points yesterday.  The Ifo Institute said its German business climate index,
based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 106.2 this
month from 105.9 in June. Economists forecast a reading of
106.1, according to a Bloomberg News survey. The expectations
index fell to 102.4 from 102.5.  France, Belgium  French  10-year yields  rose two basis points to 2.29
percent, meaning the extra yield investors get for holding the
securities instead of bunds narrowed two basis points to 61
basis points. The spread expanded to 69 basis points on July 22,
the widest since June 24.  The Belgian-German  spread  contracted three basis points to
88 basis points. It was wider than 1 percentage point as
recently as July 23.  “ Belgium  is quite attractive as it underperformed versus
both core and periphery and offers good pick-ups,” said
Gianluca Ziglio, executive director of fixed-income research at
Sunrise Brokers LLP in London. “The same also applies to
France.”  Spanish bonds advanced after the National Statistics
Institute said the jobless rate declined to 26.3 percent the
three months through June, compared with a record 27.2 percent
in the previous quarter.  The nation’s  10-year yield  fell five basis points to 4.63
percent after declining to 4.58 percent on July 23, the lowest
level since June 19.  Italy’s bonds slid, with the 10-year yield rising two basis
points to 4.39 percent. The nation is scheduled to auction 3
billion euros of zero-coupon bonds due in 2015 tomorrow.  Yields Suppressed  Yields of Europe’s periphery nations have remained
suppressed this year even as a banking collapse in Cyprus and
political impasses in Italy and Portugal threatened to reignite
the region’s debt crisis. In the year since European Central
Bank President Mario Draghi made his pledge to defend the euro
by buying government debt, borrowing costs for Europe’s highest
debt and deficit nations have tumbled.  Draghi backed his July pledge in September by announcing a
program known as Outright Monetary Transactions, under which the
ECB will buy unlimited quantities of the bonds of member nations
that meet certain criteria. The program covers notes with a
maturity of one to three years and will only be activated after
a government requests help.  Spanish 10-year yields have fallen from a euro-era record
of 7.75 percent set the day before Draghi’s July 26, 2012
speech. Italian 10-year yields dropped more than 2 percentage
points in the same period.  Volatility on Spain’s bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Finland and Germany,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.3 percent this
year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. Italian securities returned 3.2 percent and Spanish
bonds rose 6.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
