T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) , the fourth-largest
U.S. wireless carrier, is expanding its MetroPCS service to 15
new cities, including 13 in rival  Leap Wireless International
Inc. (LEAP) ’s territory.  T-Mobile, which acquired MetroPCS this year, is now selling
service under the company’s brand on its faster, long-term
evolution network. The expansion comes after  AT&T Inc. (T)   started 
offering LTE service to its GoPhone prepaid customers last
month. AT&T agreed to buy Leap, which like MetroPCS offers pay-as-you-go subscriptions, earlier this month for $1.2 billion.  “This gets us into those Leap markets now, arriving months
in advance of AT&T,” said MetroPCS Chief Operating Officer Tom Keys. The new cities include Baltimore, Houston and Seattle.  T-Mobile decided after its merger to keep the MetroPCS
brand and continue operating stores separately. Instead of
integrating the two carriers’ incompatible networks, T-Mobile is
selling the MetroPCS service with phones that work on T-Mobile’s
network.  MetroPCS offers plans starting at $40 a month with
unlimited calling and texting. High-speed  Internet access  is
capped at 500 megabits, shifting to slower speeds after that
allotment is reached. AT&T’s GoPhone offer has a $40 plan with a
200-megabit cap.  MetroPCS will open 1,000 new stores this year, said T-Mobile Chief Marketing Officer Mike Sievert. “We are going into
dense, urban areas,” he said. “’This is a big part of our
strategy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
