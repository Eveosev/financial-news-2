Equities trading on exchanges
globally fell 2.4 percent in the first half, led by declines in
the U.S. and  Europe , according to data provided by members of
the World Federation of Exchanges.  The number of trades executed electronically dropped to
5.11 billion from 5.24 billion in the same period last year,  WFE
said in a statement today . The Asia-Pacific region bucked the
trend, with transacations increasing to 3.22 billion from 3.06
billion. Trading rose 12 percent from the second half of 2012,
WFE said.  The numbers come as exchanges start to release second-quarter results. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., the operator of the
second-largest U.S. stock exchange, yesterday said quarterly
profit declined on costs associated with acquisitions.  Deutsche
Boerse AG (DB1) , operator of the Eurex derivatives exchange and the
Frankfurt stock exchange, will post earnings today and  NYSE
Euronext (NYX)  reports next week.  Derivatives trading rose 14 percent in the first half to
10.1 billion contracts, WFE said. Single-stock options were the
most actively traded derivative, with volumes rising 6 percent
to 2.06 billion.  The number of derivatives traded on exchanges worldwide
fell last year for the first time since 2004, according to data
from WFE. About 21 billion contracts changed hands on exchanges
last year, down from 25 billion in 2011. Commodity derivatives
were the only asset class that grew, the industry group said.  WFE is a 59-member trade association for exchange operators
that develops and promotes standards in markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
