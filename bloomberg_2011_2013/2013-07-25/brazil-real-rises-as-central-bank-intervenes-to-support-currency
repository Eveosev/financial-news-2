Brazil ’s real climbed as the central
bank intervened to support the currency for a third time this
week by offering foreign-exchange swaps.  The real appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.2438 per  U.S. dollar 
at 11 a.m. in Sao Paulo after falling 0.2 percent. It tumbled
1.6 percent yesterday, the most since June 19, even as the
monetary authority sold $993 million of currency swaps. The
central bank issued the same amount today.  The currency has tumbled 11 percent in the past three
months, the biggest drop among 24 emerging-market counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg. The depreciation pushes up the price of
imports and threatens to further fuel inflation, which helped
sparked nationwide street protests last month.  “The central bank is worried about inflation and wants to
secure the dollar at a lower level,” Paulo Petrassi, a partner
at Leme Investimentos, said in a telephone interview from
Florianopolis, Brazil.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2017 climbed 11
basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 10.47 percent as U.S.
Treasury yields rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
