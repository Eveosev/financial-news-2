American Roads LLC, which operates
highways including the mile-long  Detroit Windsor Tunnel  linking
the U.S. with  Canada , sought bankruptcy court protection, citing
$830 million in debt related to swaps and bonds.  The Detroit-based company listed more than $100 million in
assets in Chapter 11 papers filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in New York.  The filings “are not the result of the recent bankruptcy
filing of Detroit, although Detroit’s financial situation has
contributed to the difficulties,” Chief Executive Officer  Neal
Belitsky  said in court papers.  Traffic-related revenue declines from toll operations, most
in Alabama, involve “the economic recession, the volatility of
gas prices, reduced travel and discretionary spending,” toll
increases, Congressional mandates for increased documentation,
and events including the Deepwater Horizon BP spill in the Gulf
of Mexico, a tornado “and a declining population in the  Detroit 
area,” Belitsky said.  Among the company’s largest unsecured creditors listed in
court papers are holders of about $500 million in bonds, with
the trustee listed as Bank of New York Mellon.  The case is In re American Roads LLC, 13-bk-12412, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
