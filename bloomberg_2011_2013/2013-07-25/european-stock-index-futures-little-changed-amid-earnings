European stocks  declined from an
almost eight-week high as companies from BASF SE to ABB Ltd.
reported earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  BASF fell to a three-month low after also saying that full-year targets now look more challenging. ABB tumbled the most in
three months as its first profit increase in six quarters
trailed forecasts and its order book shrank. Siemens AG plunged
the most since August 2011 after saying it won’t reach its
profit-margin goal for the 2014 fiscal year.  Michelin  (ML) & Cie.
lost 1.4 percent after posting a 13 percent slide in first-half
earnings.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.5 percent to 299.63 at
the close of trading, after earlier falling as much as 1.1
percent. The benchmark yesterday rose to its highest level since
May 30 as data signaled Germany is leading a revival in euro-area manufacturing and companies posted  results  that exceeded
estimates.  “Expectations for European earnings have been falling as
confidence has ebbed throughout the euro zone,” Justin Urquhart Stewart, who helps oversee about $6.8 billion at Seven
Investment Management in  London , wrote in an e-mail. “Although
economic growth expectations are improving somewhat for next
year, these are not being translated into either current
corporate results or corporate outlooks.”  Forty seven companies in the Stoxx 600 are reporting
results today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts
have reduced their estimates for full-year earnings at the
gauge’s companies by 7.7 percent since the start of the year.  Economic Reports  Investors also weighed U.S. reports that showed first-time
jobless claims increased more than forecast last week and
durable-goods orders climbed at a better-than-expected pace in
June. In  Germany , data showed  business confidence  rose for a
third month in July.  National benchmark indexes fell in 14 of the 18 western
European markets. Germany’s DAX dropped 1 percent. The U.K.’s

biggest chemical company said second-quarter earnings before
interest, taxes and one-time items fell 5.4 percent to 1.83
billion euros ($2.41 billion). The average estimate of analysts
in a Bloomberg survey had called for 1.99 billion euros.  “The economic environment is and remains volatile,” Chief
Executive Officer Kurt Bock said in a statement. “Achieving our
earnings target is significantly more challenging today than we
had expected at the beginning of the year.”  ABB, Michelin  ABB (ABBN)  lost 3.1 percent 20.78 Swiss francs, its biggest
retreat since April 17. The largest maker of power transformers
posted second-quarter net income of $763 million that missed the
$779-million average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Orders fell 7 percent.  Siemens plunged 6 percent to 78.62 euros after saying that
it no longer expects to achieve its profit-margin target of at
least 12 percent for the year to end September 2014 because of
“lower market expectations.”  Michelin slid 1.4 percent to 75.84 euros. Europe’s largest
tiremaker reported a 13 percent decline in first-half profit as
slumping auto markets in its home region sapped demand and sales
of tires for earthmovers dropped. Operating profit excluding
one-time items declined to 1.15 billion euros. The figure beat
the 1.12 billion-euro average forecast.  Orange SA declined 3.2 percent to 7.50 euros.  France ’s
former phone monopoly posted an 8.5 percent drop in earnings and
disclosed tax liabilities of 2.14 billion euros.  Commerzbank Writedown  Commerzbank AG lost 1.6 percent to 6.74 euros, after

interest, taxes, amortization and exceptional expenses to at
least equal the 2012 level. The company has made a confident
statement about full-year prospects, ABN Amro Bank NV said.  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc advanced 5.1 percent to 1,240
pence, its highest price since at least 1988. The second-biggest
maker of commercial-aircraft engines said first-half profit
jumped 34 percent as Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS delivered more
planes.  Randstad Holding NV (RAND)  gained 3.1 percent to 37.48 euros.
Berenberg Bank said the company’s performance report showed
“strong cost control” to compensate for weak growth in the
second quarter. The bank also expects Randstad’s second-half
growth to be “positive.”  Logitech International SA jumped 8.6 percent to 6.67
francs, rallying the most since April 2012. The biggest maker of
