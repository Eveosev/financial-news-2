BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s biggest
chemical company, posted profit that missed analyst estimates
and said meeting annual targets looks more difficult than at the
start of the year amid pressure on prices.  Earnings before interest, taxes and one-time items fell 5.4
percent to 1.83 billion euros ($2.42 billion), the Ludwigshafen,
Germany-based company said today. Analysts predicted 1.99
billion euros, on average. The shares fell the most in most in
more than 2 1/2 years in  Frankfurt  trading.  Chief Executive Officer Kurt Bock, who is already cutting
940 jobs, said today he sees potential for annual cost cuts to
exceed the 1 billion euros a year planned for the end of 2015.
The company, which is shifting investment to  Asia , pared its
outlook for growth of the global economy as well as industrial
and chemical production.  “It doesn’t look that pretty,” said Oliver Schwarz, a
chemical analyst at Warburg Research in Hamburg, who rates the
stock hold. “At the chemical sectors, prices had a negative
influence. You can see in the BASF numbers that the outlook is
becoming more difficult.”  BASF stock fell as much as 5 percent, the biggest intraday
drop since November 2011, to 66.37 euros and it was down 3.2
percent at 66.65 euros as of 10:05 a.m. local time. It’s dropped
12 percent in six months in Frankfurt, cutting the market value
to 61 billion euros.  ‘Volatile’  Deflation in chemicals and slower growth in  China  will
likely lead analysts to lower 2013 earnings estimates for BASF
by 5 percent to 10 percent, JPMorgan Cazenove analyst Martin Evans said.  Sales rose 2.9 percent to 18.4 billion euros in the three
months through June, in line with analyst estimates. Net income
fell 4.2 percent to 1.16 billion euros, with earnings per share
at 1.26 euros.  “We expect a flat development in the second half,” Bock
said in a Bloomberg television interview today. “There is no
real underlying growth dynamic that we would see right now.”
The chemical maker has seen no pick-up in demand in July, which
will probably continue into August, the CEO said.  BASF, reporting under new accounting standards for the
first time in 2013, is sticking to a full-year forecast for
sales and earnings to rise from last year’s restated 72.1
billion euros and 6.6 billion euros respectively.  Outlook Dims  The German company, which ties its profit forecasts to
economic growth, now expects gross domestic product to increase
2 percent instead of 2.4 percent. It also pared predictions for
industrial production growth to 2.7 percent from 3.4 percent and
chemical production gains to 3.1 percent from 3.6 percent.  The chemical maker also reiterated medium-term profit and
sales targets. Ebitda will probably rise to about 14 billion
euros on sales of 80 billion euros in 2015 and increase to 22
billion euros in profit on revenue of 110 billion euros in 2020.  BASF will invest 10 billion euros in the Asia-Pacific
region, shifting research and procurement there, to help boost
profitability, deputy CEO  Martin Brudermueller  said in June. The
money, of which about 80 percent may come from BASF and the rest
from partners, will be partly used to expand chemical sites in
Nanjing, China and Kuantan,  Malaysia , he said.  “The good old times of relatively easy growth in China are
over,” Bock said today in the television interview. “We are
working very hard on our cost base.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
