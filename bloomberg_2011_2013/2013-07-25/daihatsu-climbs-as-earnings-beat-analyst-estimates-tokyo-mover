Daihatsu Motor Co. (7262) , the minicar
maker 52 percent owned by  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , advanced the most
in more than two years in Tokyo trading as first-quarter profit
beat analysts’ estimates.  The  Osaka , Japan-based automaker  gained  7.9 percent to
2,237 yen, its biggest increase since March 2011, at the 3 p.m.
close of Tokyo trading. The  benchmark   Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
lost 1.1 percent.  Daihatsu’s net income in the three months ended June grew
13 percent to 23.3 billion yen ($233 million), beating the 20.4
billion yen average of analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
While  Japan ’s biggest minicar company maintained its forecast
for the year ending March 2014, the carmaker said overseas
volume sales grew 2 percent in the quarter, with stronger demand
from  Indonesia .  Helped by the weaker Japanese currency, earnings are
rebounding at Toyota as well. Net income in the year ending
March 2014 will likely grow to 1.66 billion yen, according to
the average  analyst estimate  compiled by Bloomberg. Toyota will
report its first-quarter earnings Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
