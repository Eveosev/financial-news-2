Treasury 10-year yields rose to the
highest level in more than a week as orders for durable goods
exceeded forecasts, bolstering bets the economy is strong enough
for the  Federal Reserve  to start trimming bond purchases.  Government debt fell a third day before the U.S. is
scheduled to sell $29 billion of seven-year notes after auctions
of two- and five-year debt this week drew lower-than-average
demand.  New home sales  climbed to a five-year high, the Commerce
Department said yesterday.  Thirty-year yields  approached the
highest level in almost two years.  “Durable goods data is showing some strength going into
the third quarter,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in
 New York  at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “We have more
supply -- people are not willing to go too far out on the curve.
That takes away some of the domestic demand. It’s going to be a
bit more difficult auction today.”  The benchmark 10-year yield added three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 2.62 percent at 11:21 a.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield
touched 2.63 percent, the highest since July 15. The 1.75
percent note due May 2023 dropped 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face
amount, to 92 15/32.  The 30-year  yield  was at 3.68 percent after rising to 3.72
percent on July 8, the most since August 2011.  Investor Loss  Treasuries have slumped this year as signs the Fed will
start tapering  purchases (NHSLTOT)  undermined demand for the securities.
Thirty-year bonds handed investors a loss of 11 percent in 2013
through yesterday, compared with a 5.7 percent decline for 10-year notes and a 3.8 percent loss for seven-year debt, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes show.  Bookings for goods  meant to last at least three years
increased 4.2 percent after a revised 5.2 percent gain in May
that was bigger than initially reported, the Commerce Department
said today in Washington. The median forecast of 79 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1.4 percent advance. Unfilled
orders for big-ticket goods rose the most since December 2007.  A separate report showed jobless claims rose by 7,000 to
343,000 in the week ended July 20 from a revised 336,000 the
prior period, the Labor Department said in  Washington . The
median forecast of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected
340,000. The retooling at carmakers and school closings typical
during this time of year continued to influence the figures las
week, a spokesman said as the data were released.  ‘Upward Path’  Purchases of new U.S. homes rose 8.3 percent in June to an
annualized pace of 497,000, the highest level since May 2008,
the government said yesterday.  “There’s been a signal that the global business cycle may
have reached the bottom and the economy is recovering, albeit at
different paces in the U.S. and  Europe ,” said Annalisa Piazza,
a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in London. “The U.S.
has led the others in terms of growth, and Treasury yields are
likely to be on an upward path although we expect some
volatility in coming months.”  The Fed, which has been buying  $85 billion  of bonds each
month to put downward pressure on borrowing costs, will start
trimming purchases in September, according to a separate
Bloomberg survey of economists. It bought $4.83 billion in
Treasuries maturing between July 2017 and March 2018 today as
part of the program.  Volatility Rises  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was at 80.2 basis points
yesterday, up from 72.62 on July 22, the least since May 24. The
gauge rose to 117.89 on July 5, the highest since December 2010.  Treasury  trading  volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , was $345.9 billion
yesterday, above this month’s average of $278.4 billion.  The Fed’s  measure  of traders’ forecasts for costs in the
economy for the period from 2018 to 2023, known as the five-year
five-year forward break-even rate, was at 2.59 percent. It has
risen from 2.33 percent last month, which was the lowest since
2011. The average over the past decade is 2.75 percent.  “We expect the auction to go well,” said  Richard Gilhooly , an interest-rate strategist at TD Securities Inc. in
New York. “They are at decent levels, at 2 percent. The market
has cheapened up into supply.”  The seven-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 2.03
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 1.93 percent at
the previous sale of the securities on June 27. Investors bid
for 2.61 times the amount of debt offered last month, compared
with the average of 2.65 for the 10 offerings through June.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealers buying for their own
accounts, purchased 15.7 percent of the notes last month, the
least in 11 months.  Indirect bidders , which include foreign
central banks, bought 46.4 percent of the securities, the most
since August 2011.  Investors at the five-year auction yesterday  bid  for 2.46
times the amount of debt available, less than the 2.8 average of
the prior 10 sales. A two-year sale on July 23 drew  bids  for
3.08 times the amount offered, compared with the average of 3.54
for the previous 10 auctions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
