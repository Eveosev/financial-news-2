The  Chicago Cubs  got final approval
to bring their 99-year-old ballpark into the modern era of  Major
League Baseball  with a $500 million renovation project that
includes a giant video board at Wrigley Field.  The Chicago City Council, by a voice vote, yesterday gave
the Cubs permission to move forward with the project that
includes a 5,700-square-foot video scoreboard in left field to
supplement the manual one in center field as well as oversized
advertising signage rising above the outfield walls.  “I am pleased to take another step forward in this process
as we plan for the revitalization of Wrigley Field and the
surrounding area,” said Chicago Mayor  Rahm Emanuel  in a
statement. “We are continuing to move forward on this plan to
bring valuable jobs and economic impact to the Lakeview
community without using any taxpayer dollars.”  Cubs’ spokesman Julian Green didn’t respond to an e-mail
for comment on the council’s decision.  The Landmarks Commission on July 11 gave unanimous approval
for the structures, key ingredients in the team’s renovation
plan for Wrigley Field and redevelopment of the neighborhood
with a hotel and office-retail complex.  Team owner Tom Ricketts and Emanuel wanted to gain approve
for the deal before the end of July so construction can start
after the regular season ends, the  Chicago Tribune  said.  Wrigley Field, built in 1914 on the grounds of a seminary,
is the second-oldest ballpark in the major leagues behind
 Boston ’s Fenway Park, which was constructed in 1912.  To contact the reporter on this story:
