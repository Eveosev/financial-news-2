Beijing sold a high-end residential
land parcel for a record price as developers sought to tap
rising demand for luxury homes even as the government maintains
its property curbs.  The 75,360 square-meter (811,168 square-foot) Sunhe plot,
in a northeastern part of the city known as the “central villa
district” near the airport, was sold for 2.36 billion  yuan 
($385 million) to  COFCO Property (Group) Co. (000031)  on July 23,
according to a statement on the local land reserve center’s
website. That implies about 46,000 yuan a square meter of
buildable area, beating a record set July 3 by a site in
southwest Beijing, according to realtor Bacic & 5i5j Group.  The number of apartments sold for more than 10 million yuan
in the Chinese capital jumped 81 percent to 1,388 in the first
half from a year earlier, as wealthy buyers favored bigger
properties under the government’s purchase restrictions, Bacic &
5i5j said. China’s new  home prices  rose in all but one city in
June, official data showed this month, underscoring Premier  Li
Keqiang ’s struggle to make housing affordable even as the
economy cools.  “The price won’t affect the ordinary people as the land
will probably be used to build villas” rather than apartments
for the mass market, Cheng Haoye, a senior manager at Bacic &
5i5j, the city’s second-biggest property broker, said by phone.
“It could actually help lower home prices as such profits from
high-end land give the government more money to spend on
affordable-housing projects.”  Land Demand  New home prices in Beijing jumped 13 percent in June from a
year earlier, according to National Bureau of Statistics data on
July 18.  COFCO Property’s Beijing unit won the auction by committing
to build 33,000 square meters of public rental housing after a
land-price ceiling was reached, according to the land reserve
center. Phone calls to the developer’s Shenzhen-based board
secretary Li Hui went unanswered.  Land sales rose 67 percent to 51 billion yuan in  China ’s 10
major cities in June from last year, according to China Real
Estate Information Corp., a Shanghai-based property data and
consulting firm.  Shanghai  on July 3 sold the most expensive plot in the city
this year, a 79,500-square-meter site, for 4.9 billion yuan to
developers including China Vanke Co. The same day, a piece of
land sold in Beijing’s southwest Fengtai district for 45,000
yuan per square meter, the city’s highest this year by that
measure before the latest auction, Bacic & 5i5j said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
