An independent Scotland would
prioritize air and naval defense and ditch Trident nuclear
missiles, Scottish First Minister  Alex Salmond  said today.  Independence would allow the country to develop more
appropriate capabilities with a focus on securing offshore oil
and gas resources, protecting fisheries and safeguarding coastal
waters, Salmond said in the Shetland Islands, according to an e-mailed statement of his speech.  “At present what we have, we don’t need and what we need,
we don’t have,” Salmond said. “It is absurd for a nation with
a coastline longer than  India ’s to have no major surface vessels
and it’s obscene for a nation of five million people to host
weapons of mass destruction.”  Salmond’s  Scottish National Party , which runs the semi-autonomous government in Edinburgh, last year reversed its 30-year opposition to membership of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization on condition that all existing nuclear weapons on
Scottish soil are removed. The U.K.’s nuclear deterrent is based
30 miles from Glasgow,  Scotland ’s largest city.  Trident and the future of the Scottish warship-building
yards are at heart of the defense debate over whether Scotland
would be better off by breaking away from the rest of the U.K.  The latest opinion polls show supporters of Salmond’s
campaign for independence lagging behind those in favor of the
status quo by more than 20 percentage points ahead of the Sept.
18, 2014, referendum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
