Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide
Inc. (HOT) , owner of the luxury St. Regis and W brands, said second-quarter earnings climbed as the company’s margins widened.  Net income rose to $137 million, or 71 cents a share, from
$122 million, or 62 cents, a year earlier, the  Stamford ,
Connecticut-based company said today in a statement.  “We exceeded our profit expectations -- despite slower
revenue growth and exchange rate headwinds,” Chief Executive
Officer Frits van Paasschen said in the statement.  Starwood is benefiting from rising demand for its brands,
such as Sheraton and Westin, from individual business travelers
and vacationers in the U.S., according to  Patrick Scholes , an
analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. in New York.  “They are well positioned to take advantage of individual
business travel -- their bread and butter -- which is doing very
well, particularly in the U.S.,” Scholes, who has a hold rating
on the stock, said before the report. “Leisure is also doing
fairly well, particularly domestically.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
