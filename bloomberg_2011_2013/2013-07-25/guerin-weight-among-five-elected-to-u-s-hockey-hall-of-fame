Former  New Jersey  Devils right wing
Bill Guerin and  New York  Rangers center Doug Weight are among
five people selected for induction to the U.S. Hockey Hall of
Fame.  The hall, in Eveleth, Minnesota, honors players and
individuals who contributed to hockey in the U.S., unlike the
Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, which honors people who
contributed to the sport anywhere.  Guerin, a 42-year-old Massachusetts native, played 18
seasons in the  National Hockey League , including six with the
Devils, who drafted him fifth overall out of Boston College in
1989. He won the  Stanley Cup  with New Jersey in 1995 and
Pittsburgh in 2009. Guerin registered 429 goals with 427 assists
over 1,263 games. He also played for Boston, Dallas,  St. Louis 
and San Jose and represented the U.S. in the 1998, 2002 and 2006
Olympics and the 1996 and 2004 World Cup of Hockey.  Weight, a second-round draft pick of the Rangers in 1990,
played 19 seasons in the NHL, including eight with the Edmonton
Oilers. He also played with St. Louis, Carolina -- winning a
Stanley Cup in 2006 -- and Anaheim before finishing his career
with the New York Islanders. A play-making center, Weight
compiled 755 assists along with 278 goals in 1,238 NHL games. He
played for the U.S. in nine international competitions,
including the 1998, 2002 and 2006 Olympics.  Cindy Hurley, a pioneering member of the U.S. Women’s
National Team and the all-time women’s scoring leader at Rhode
Island’s Providence College, also will be inducted along with
Hurricanes owner Peter Karmanos Jr. and U.S. college coach Ron
Mason, who amassed 924 coaching wins over a 36 years. The win
total of Mason, who coached Michigan State for 23 years, ranks
second to  Boston College  coach Jerry York’s 935.  To contact the reporter on this story:
