German rail operator Deutsche Bahn
AG cut its forecasts for sales and profit as slower economic
growth hurts the company’s freight business and flooding in
 Germany  weighed on passenger traffic.  Earnings before interest and taxes adjusted for one-time
effects will decline to about 2.2 billion euros ($2.9 billion)
this year from 2.7 billion euros in 2012. Deutsche Bahn
previously forecast more than 2.8 billion euros. Sales will rise
about 0.5 percent to 39.5 billion euros, compared with an
earlier forecast for about 41 billion euros.  “After a very good year 2012, we are facing some
extraordinary challenges,” Chief Financial Officer Richard Lutz
said in a statement.  Shipping companies are struggling as the countries sharing
the euro endure the longest recession since the currency was
introduced. Excess capacity of container ships is also
depressing sea freight rates, as is competition in European
overland transport.  First-half profit fell 29 percent to 554 million euros as
sales dropped 0.6 percent. Deutsche Bahn pared its forecasts for
growth in overall global sea freight volumes to 2 percent from 4
percent. The company now expects global air freight to decline 1
percent, compared with an earlier forecast for unchanged
volumes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
