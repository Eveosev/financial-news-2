BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , France’s largest
bank, acquired a unit of  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  to boost the funds it
manages for investors in Germany.  The business, which settles securities transactions and
administers funds, supervised about 93 billion euros ($123
billion) at the end of April, BNP and Frankfurt-based
Commerzbank said today in separate e-mailed statements. No price
was disclosed for the transaction.  BNP’s securities services unit, which manages more than $7
trillion for clients, said it will win custodian business from
the German mutual funds of  Allianz SE (ALV) ’s asset management arm.
Commerzbank, which is cutting 5,200 jobs to boost profit, may
move more than 80 employees to the Paris-based bank as part of
the sale.  The transaction doesn’t affect Commerzbank’s custody
business, which provides services to private, business, and
corporate and institutional clients, the German lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
