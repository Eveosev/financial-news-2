Zambia’s inflation was unchanged at
7.3 percent in July, the  Central Statistics Office  said.  Price rose 0.7 percent in the month, John Kalumbi, director
of the agency, told reporters in Lusaka, the capital.  The Bank of Zambia has raised the benchmark  interest rate 
for the past two months to curb prices as the government removed
subsidies for fuel and corn farmers. Inflation will probably end
the year above the bank’s 6 percent target, Isaac Ngoma,
president at the Lusaka-based Economics Association of Zambia,
said on July 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
