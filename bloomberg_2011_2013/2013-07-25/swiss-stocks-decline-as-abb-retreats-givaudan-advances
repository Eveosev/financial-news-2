Swiss stocks  declined as  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) 
posted profit that missed analysts’ estimates, while investors
awaited a report that may show German business confidence rose.  ABB fell the most in three months after reporting that
orders dropped from a year earlier.  Givaudan SA (GIVN)  added 3.3
percent after posting first-half profit that beat analysts’
projections.  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  gained 1.4 percent after saying
profit climbed 10 percent in the first half.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  slid 0.3 percent to 7,898.28 at 9:55
a.m. in Zurich. The gauge gained the most since July 10
yesterday as  euro-area manufacturing  unexpectedly expanded and
pharmaceutical companies advanced. The broader Swiss Performance
Index also fell 0.3 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 35 percent greater than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Ifo institute’s  business-climate index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 106.1 in July from 105.9
in June, according to the median of 45 forecasts in a Bloomberg
News  survey . A measure of current conditions also gained, while
a gauge of expectations was unchanged, according to estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
