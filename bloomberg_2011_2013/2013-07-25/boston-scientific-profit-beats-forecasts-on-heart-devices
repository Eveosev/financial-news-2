Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) , the second-biggest maker of heart-rhythm devices, reported profit that beat
analysts’ estimates and raised its forecast amid signs that
demand for defibrillators and stents is starting to stabilize.
The shares rose the most in two years.  Second-quarter earnings, excluding one-time items, of 12
cents a share outpaced by 3 cents the average of 20 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue fell 1.1 percent to
$1.81 billion, the Natick, Massachusetts-based company said in a
statement today. Analysts had estimated $1.78 billion.  Boston Scientific raised its 2013 profit forecast to 67
cents to 71 cents a share, from its April outlook of 65 cents to
70 cents. Growth in  emerging markets  helped bolster the second-quarter sales, Boston Scientific executives said on a conference
call today.  “Our team is beginning to build momentum and execute our
global strategy,” Chief Executive Officer  Michael Mahoney  said
on the call.  Boston Scientific rose 12 percent to $10.77 at 10:11 a.m.
 New York  time, after  trading  as high as $10.81 for its biggest
intraday climb since July 28, 2011. The shares rose 85 percent
in the 12 months through yesterday.  Net Income  Second-quarter  net income  of $130 million, or 10 cents a
share, compared with a loss of $3.58 billion, or $2.51, a year
earlier that included a one-time goodwill cost of $3.4 billion,
the company said.  “Everything was just a little bit better,”  Joanne Wuensch , an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said in
a telephone interview. “Each segment was a little better than
expected.”  The results follow  St. Jude Medical Inc. (STJ) ’s posting of
better-than-estimated sales of defibrillators used to shock a
stopped heart back into action and pacemakers to regulate the
rhythm.  “We suspect in the case of a potential stable-to-improving
implanted cardiac defibrillator market that a rising tide lifts
all boats,” said Danielle Antalffy, an analyst with Leerink
Swann Research in New York, in a July 17 note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
