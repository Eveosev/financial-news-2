D.C. United and city officials have
reached a tentative deal for a $300 million soccer stadium
seating 20,000 fans in Southwest Washington, the Washington Post
reported, citing City Administrator Allen Y. Lew.  The Major League Soccer team has played at RFK Stadium
since its founding in 1996. The new stadium would be a few
blocks southwest of Nationals Park, home of the Washington
Nationals of  Major League Baseball .  Under the terms of the agreement that needs approval from
the D.C. Council, the District would provide about $150 million
to assemble land and prepare infrastructure and the team would
cover the building costs, the Post said.  The team would be given a 25- to 35-year lease for the land
and would have the opportunity to develop restaurants, shops and
possibly a hotel nearby, the Post said. A sales and use tax
abatement worth as much as $2.6 million in its first year is
also a part of the tentative deal.  D.C. United is one of the 17-year-old league’s original and
most successful franchises, winning the MLS Cup in 1996, 1997,
1999 and 2004, and twice capturing the U.S. Open Cup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
