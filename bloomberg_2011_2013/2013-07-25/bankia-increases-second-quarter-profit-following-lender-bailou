Bankia SA (BKIA) , the Spanish lender whose
real-estate losses helped push Spain to seek a bailout for its
banking system last year, boosted profit after cutting costs and
increasing revenue.  Net income was 126 million euros ($166 million) in the
second quarter compared with 74 million euros in the preceding
three months, the Valencia, Spain-based lender said in a
regulatory filing today, without providing year-earlier figures.
That missed the average 163.2 million-euro estimate of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bankia needed about half of the 41 billion euros in
European funds sought by Spain last year to support its banking
industry as property-linked losses threatened to overwhelm some
lenders and pile up costs for the government.  Spain ’s  fourth-largest  lender is seeking to increase annual profit to 1.2
billion euros by 2015 after passing 22.3 billion euros of soured
real estate assets to a government bad bank in December.  The BFA-Bankia group, which includes Bankia’s parent,
posted after-tax profit of 428 million euros, putting it on
course to meet its full-year target of 800 million euros, the
 lender  said.  Net interest income, excluding the impact of a subordinated
loan from its parent, rose to 633 million euros in the second
quarter from 601 million euros in the preceding three months.
Operating costs fell 1.2 percent to 488 million euros over that
period.  Bad loans as a proportion of total lending rose to 13.36
percent from 12.99 percent in December, the bank said, adding
that its stock of refinanced loans was 22.1 billion euros of
which 44 percent had been classified as “doubtful.”  Second-quarter net income was calculated by subtracting
first-quarter profit from the first-half figure of 200 million
euros published by Bankia today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
