Mexican peso bonds fell, pushing
yields to a two-week high, as a bigger-than-forecast increase in
orders for U.S. durable goods fueled speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will curtail monetary stimulus.  Yields on securities due in 2024 climbed nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 5.92 percent at 9:54 a.m. in  Mexico 
City, the highest level on a closing basis since July 8,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mexico’s peso
depreciated 0.1 percent to 12.6371 per  U.S. dollar .  “There has been a series of indicators that in general are
showing a recovery in the economy” in the U.S., Salvador Orozco, deputy director for money markets and exchange at Grupo
Financiero Santander Mexico SAB, said by phone from Mexico City.
“The market gives a greater possibility that the Fed will start
to change its monetary policy posture.”  The Fed will trim its monthly bond buying to $65 billion in
September from the current pace of $85 billion, according to
half of the economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  from July 18
to 22, up from 44 percent last month.  Bookings for U.S. goods meant to last at least three years
increased 4.2 percent in June after a revised 5.2 percent gain
in the prior month that was bigger than initially estimated, the
Commerce Department reported. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 1.4 percent advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
