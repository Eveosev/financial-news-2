Ken Griffin ’s Citadel LLC, the
hedge-fund firm that employed Richard S. Lee before he was hired
by  Steve Cohen ’s SAC Capital Advisors LP, said it terminated
Lee’s employment because of an internal transfer of positions
that violated standard practices.  “Mr. Lee’s actions would have impacted only his potential
future compensation,” Citadel, which is based in Chicago, said
today in an e-mailed statement. “Within hours, Mr. Lee’s
misconduct was reported to Citadel management. Mr. Lee was
immediately terminated.”  Citadel said Lee transferred the positions to a portfolio
that he was set to oversee, using pricing methods that weren’t
in accordance with generally accepted practices. The U.S., which
today charged Lee with conspiracy to commit  securities fraud 
while at SAC, said SAC hired him despite receiving a warning
that Lee was known for being part of Citadel’s ‘insider trading
group.’  “Citadel does not have, and never has had, an ‘insider
trading group,’ ‘’ the firm said in its statement. ‘‘Citadel has
strict rules against, and oversight designed to prevent, insider
trading. Any suggestion to the contrary is baseless and without
merit.’’  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
