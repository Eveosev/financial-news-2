London Mayor Boris Johnson announced
plans for the city’s first indoor ski center.  By the end of the summer,  Westfield Group (WDC)  will be making a
planning application for the project, adjacent to London’s
Olympic Park, Johnson said at a press conference at City Hall
today.  It will have a combined ski run of 800 meters, he said, and
it’s planned to complete it within the next two years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
