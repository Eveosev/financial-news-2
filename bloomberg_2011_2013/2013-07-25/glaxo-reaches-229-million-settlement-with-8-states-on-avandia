GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  has reached a
$229 million settlement in principle with eight U.S. states to
resolve lawsuits relating to the development and marketing of
its Avandia diabetes drug, and a separate action from  Louisiana 
for other products.  The amount is within existing provisions set aside for
legal matters, the London-based company said in a statement
yesterday.  Glaxo said last year it agreed to pay $3 billion to settle
federal and state government claims that it illegally promoted
 prescription drugs  and failed to report clinical data on
Avandia, once the worldâ€™s best-selling diabetes pill. The drug,
which was withdrawn from the European market in 2010, is
governed by a strict program in the U.S. that limits its use to
patients who understand the risks and have no alternatives.  The $3 billion settlement was the largest-ever in a health-care fraud case in the U.S.  At least 41 whistle-blower complaints against
pharmaceutical companies have been filed in U.S. federal fraud
cases that contained allegations of improper marketing between
1996 and 2010, leading to $7.9 billion in settlements, according
to  Aaron Kesselheim  of the Harvard School of  Public Health .  To contact the reporter on this story:
