Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened for a third day to the largest differential since
September as lower corn prices eased the cost of manufacturing
the biofuel.  The spread expanded by 7.62 cents to 79.2 cents a gallon
after the most active corn contract touched the lowest level
since Oct. 5, 2010. The corn crush spread, or the cost
difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to
make it, based on September contracts, was 33 cents, compared
with losses most of last year.  “If they’re paying less for the corn, they don’t have to
get as much for their ethanol,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at
Linn Group in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 11.4 cents, or
4.9 percent, to $2.225 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 1.6 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery declined 3.78 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.017 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for September delivery decreased 12.25 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $4.96 a bushel in Chicago. The more actively traded
December contract slipped 1.5 cents to $4.7875.  Kitt said higher imports this year also have bolstered
supply. An Energy Information Administration report yesterday
showed the U.S. made foreign purchases of the biofuel for a
third week last week and that  imports  have averaged 21,000
barrels a day, double the rate a year earlier.  RINs Drop  Ethanol also plunged as the value for Renewable
Identification Numbers, the tracking certificates the government
and refiners use to check compliance with consumption mandates,
tumbled on concern the targets may be reduced, Kitt said.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  slumped 18 percent to $1.03, the
steepest drop since March, while  advanced RINs , which cover
Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol and biodiesel, were unchanged
at $1.30, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stockpiles of the fuel climbed 4.1 percent last week to
17.3 million barrels, the most since April 19, according to
yesterday’s report from the EIA, the Energy Department’s
research arm. Ethanol  production  slumped 2.6 percent to 853,000
barrels a day, the lowest since May 3.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 92 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, little changed from the previous week, EIA
said.  In cash market trading, ethanol sank 9 cents to $2.345 a
gallon in the Gulf, 8.5 cents to $2.26 in Chicago, 6.5 cents to
$2.385 in New York and 4.5 cents to $2.575 a gallon on the West
Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf expanded by 4.5
cents to 23 cents, the widest since April 18, while Chicago’s
discount to New York Harbor gained 2 cents to 12.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
