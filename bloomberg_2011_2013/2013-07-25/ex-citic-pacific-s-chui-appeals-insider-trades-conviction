Citic Pacific Ltd. (267) ’s former deputy
head of finance Chui Wing Nin appealed his conviction and
sentence for insider trading.  Magistrate Li Kwok-wai, who convicted Chui last year and
sentenced him to 15 months in prison, failed to adequately
evaluate submissions on his behalf, Chui’s lawyer told Hong
Kong’s Court of First Instance today.  Chui, who was also fined HK$1 million ($128,909), was
convicted of two counts of selling shares in Citic Pacific in
2008 before the steelmaker issued a public statement disclosing
potential losses of as much as HK$15.5 billion from wrong-way
currency bets.  Stella Fung, a prosecution witness in the trial, testified
on many subjects she had no expertise in, defense Lawyer Joseph
Tse told the court today.  Citic Pacific, controlled by  China ’s biggest state-owned
investment company, fell 55 percent on Oct. 22, 2008 after its
announcement. Chui sold a total of 81,000 shares on Sept. 9 and
Sept. 12 and avoided losses of as much as HK$1.36 million,
according to Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission.  Citic Pacific’s bets on the Australian dollar prompted a
bailout from its parent Citic Group, which is backed by China’s
cabinet, and the resignation of its then chairman Larry Yung.  The case is Hong Kong SAR and, HCMA15/2013 in Hong Kong’s
Court of First Instance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
