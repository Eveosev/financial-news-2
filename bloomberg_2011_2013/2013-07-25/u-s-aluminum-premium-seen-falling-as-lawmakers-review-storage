The premium aluminum buyers are
expected to pay for supplies in the U.S. fell for a second week
as lawmakers stepped up scrutiny of bank involvement in
warehousing, according to  Harbor Intelligence .  The premium slipped to 11.5 cents to 12 cents a pound this
week, from 11.8 cents to 12 cents a pound last week, Jorge Vazquez, managing director of the Austin, Texas-based
researcher, said in a report. The fee, which is added to the
price of metal for immediate delivery, reached a record 12 cents
to 13 cents in June.  A Senate panel held a hearing this week to examine banksâ€™
ownership of warehouses and other commodity assets after
consumers complained of long waits and rising costs. The inquiry
came three weeks after the London Metal Exchange proposed
measures to help unclog growing queues at the repositories.  Warehouse companies offer incentives to draw metal into
their sites, competing with consumers for supplies. Incentives
started to fall after the LME on July 1 proposed requiring
warehouses with wait times of more than 100 calendar days to be
shipping out more metal than they take in. The storage incentive
fell to 2.3 cents a pound in  Detroit , from 8.6 cents last week
and 10.5 cents three weeks ago, Harbor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
