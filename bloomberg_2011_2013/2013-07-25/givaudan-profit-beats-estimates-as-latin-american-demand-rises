Givaudan SA (GIVN) , the world’s largest
maker of flavorings, reported rising profits as Latin American
consumers demanded more of its flavors and perfumes.  First-half net income gained 36 percent to 271 million
francs ($289 million), the Geneva-based company said in a
statement today. The average estimate by 10 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for 229 million francs. Sales gained 5.7
percent to 2.2 billion francs, meeting analyst estimates.  Argentina and  Brazil  led flavorings sales and Latin
Americans also mainly drove a rebounding performance in
perfumes, Givaudan said in the  statement . Sales of products at
Givaudan’s Health and Wellness division with sweetness, salt and
masking capabilities grew more than 10 percent.  Chief Executive Officer Gilles Andrier is targeting sales
growth at about double the market rate even as  Europe ’s
financial difficulties weigh on demand for snacks and perfumes.
Andrier has presided over a share price rise of 35 percent this
year, outgrowing the Swiss market index of Switzerland’s 20
largest listed companies which has grown 16 percent over the
same period. Shares of Holzminden, Germany-based competitor
 Symrise AG (SY1)  have risen 19 percent.  The company confirmed a mid-term objective to grow
organically between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent per year,
assuming a market growth of 2 percent to 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
