Russian equities retreated for a
second day as metal producers slumped and crude oil, the
nation’s chief export earner, dropped.  The benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  lost 0.4 percent to 1,401.75 by
12:41 p.m. in Moscow. OAO Severstal declined 2 percent to 248.60
rubles in Moscow and 2.2 percent to $7.655 in  London , while OAO
GMK Norilsk Nickel tumbled 1.7 percent to 4,640 rubles. OAO
 Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest coking-coal producer, lost 2.8 percent
to 97.70 rubles after the shares surged 2.8 percent yesterday.  Mechel said last month it plans to spend as much as $100
million on a yearlong share buyback to curb further declines in
the stock, which has plunged 52 percent this year. Crude oil
retreated 0.2 percent to $105.14 a barrel in  New York . Russia
receives about 50 percent of its budget revenue from oil and
natural gas sales.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI (SPGSCI)  Index of commodities
dropped 0.3 percent, the second day of declines.  “Mechel gained a lot yesterday, perhaps, on the start of
the buyback, and traders are now reaping profits,” Oleg Petropavlovskiy, an analyst at BCS Financial Group in Moscow,
said by phone. “Norilsk is being sold off and it’s a good
opportunity to buy the stock. Severstal had rallied earlier in
the week and is now coming back to its original levels.”
Severstal gained 8.1 percent from July 19 through July 23 before
dropping for two days.  Uralkali Cut  Norilsk sank 2.1 percent to $14.17 in London. The world’s
largest nickel and palladium producer may cut its 2013 dividend
after a drop in nickel prices and a possible $1 billion drop in
revenue this year, Chief Executive Officer  Vladimir Potanin  said
in an interview with Norilsk TV channel.  OAO Uralkali, the world’s largest potash producer by
output, approved a one-year $1.6 billion share buyback program
in November after the stock fell. Uralkali decreased 3.7 percent
to 186.88 rubles, the fourth day of declines and the lowest
since October 2011.  The company has bought back about $1.3 billion of shares to
date, according to a July 22 statement. The company’s net debt
may climb to a record of two times earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization this year, according to
UralSib Capital.  VTB Capital cut the stock to sell today, citing its reduced
estimate for potash prices, according to an e-mailed note. Bank
of America Merrill Lynch cut the stock to neutral, citing a
lower potash price assumption and concerns the company’s lower
free float may lead MSCI Inc. to trim the stock’s weighting in
the  Russia  Index.  Economic Growth  China ’s manufacturing contracted at a faster pace in July,
signaling a deepening slowdown in the world’s second-largest
economy, according to an initial purchasing managers index
compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics and published
yesterday.  The Micex climbed 1.7 percent last week on speculation the
U.S. Federal Reserve will keep stimulus in place. Russia’s
equities trade at the cheapest valuations based on estimated
earnings among 21 emerging economies tracked by Bloomberg.  While Bank Rossii kept its main rates unchanged on July 12,
it introduced a one-year floating-rate facility with a starting
cost of 5.75 percent, compared with its 7.5 percent fixed-rate
for similar-maturity loans. Russia’s economy grew 1.6 percent in
the first three months, spurring calls for easing.  Gross domestic product will advance 3 percent from a year
earlier in the third quarter after expanding 2 percent in the
second, the median estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg
survey showed. That’s down from 3.1 percent and 2.1 percent in
June’s poll. There’s a 30 percent chance of a recession in the
next year, up from 20 percent a month ago, according to a survey
of 13 economists.  Low Valuations  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 45 percent
below the 30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show, while
10-day  price swings  retreated to 12.31. The 50-member Micex’s
4.8 percent decline in 2013 compares with a 2.5 percent increase
for  India ’s benchmark Sensex Index and a 21 percent loss for
 Brazil ’s  Ibovespa Index. (IBOV)   The 14-day  relative strength index  on the Micex subsided to
59 from 60 yesterday. The RSI measures how rapidly prices have
advanced or dropped during a specified time period. Readings
below 30 indicate a security may be poised to rise, while those
above 70 signal a potential drop.  The Russian Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in RTS futures, rose 1.3 percent, the first increase in
five days. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S. decreased 0.9 percent to
92.23.  The Micex trades at 5.3 times its 12-month estimated
earnings, compared with a multiple of 10 for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
