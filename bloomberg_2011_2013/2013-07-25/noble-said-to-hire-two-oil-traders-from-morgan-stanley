Pasi Siitonen and Simon Hutchinson
left their jobs as North Sea crude traders at  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  They departed more than a week ago, the people said,
declining to be identified because the information is
confidential. Siitonen and Hutchinson will join  Noble Group
Ltd. (NOBL)  and continue covering crude markets, according to two of
the people.  Stephen Brown , director of corporate affairs at Noble in
Hong Kong, declined to comment, citing company policy, in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. Hugh Fraser, a London-based spokesman for Morgan Stanley, also declined to comment by
phone yesterday.  Noble is a trader and producer of energy, foodstuffs and
metals headquartered in Hong Kong, with offices in more than 90
locations worldwide, including London, Singapore and Geneva,
according to the companyâ€™s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
