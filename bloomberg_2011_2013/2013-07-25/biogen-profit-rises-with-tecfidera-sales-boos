Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB) , a maker of
multiple sclerosis drugs, reported a 27 percent jump in second-quarter profit and raised its 2013 forecast after its recently
approved pill Tecfidera helped boost sales.  Net income climbed to $490.7 million, or $2.06 a share,
from $386.8 million, or $1.61, a year earlier, Weston,
Massachusetts-based Biogen said today in a statement. Earnings,
excluding one-time items, of $2.30 a share beat by 36 cents the
average of 27 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue from MS pill Tecfidera was $192 million, more than
double the analysts’ average $69.4 million estimate. The
medicine, cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration March
27, may draw more than $3.5 billion in annual revenue by 2017,
analysts’ project. Biogen said about $82 million of the
Tecfidera revenue represents building up of inventory, while
$110 million was generated by underlying patient demand.  “Holy mother of all launches,”  Mark Schoenebaum , an
analyst with ISI Group, wrote today in a report to clients,
noting the patient “demand” revenue of $110 million alone is
“above the high end of buy-side expectations for the total
reported number.”  Biogen rose less than 1 percent to $227.48 at the close in
New York. The shares have gained 55 percent this year.  Tysabri Effect  Total revenue climbed 21 percent to $1.72 billion, topping
analysts’ average $1.62 billion estimate. Tysabri, an infusion
for MS that Biogen bought full control of from partner Elan
Corp. earlier this year, saw sales increase 38 percent to $387
million. Revenue from the drug was affected by some patients
switching to Tecfidera, Schoenebaum said.  Biogen forecast revenue growth of 22 percent to 23 percent
this year, and said it expected adjusted earnings of $8.25 to
$8.50 a share. The company  previously projected  sales growth of
as much as 18 percent and profit of $7.80 to $7.90.  Revenue from Avonex, an injectible MS drug that is Biogen’s
 top-seller , rose 1.6 percent to $774 million in the quarter.  Tecfidera is Biogen’s first oral offering for MS, an
autoimmune disease that affects about 2.1 million people
worldwide. The company is awaiting regulatory approval of other
drugs for MS and hemophilia, and has additional medicines for MS
and diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy and Alzheimer’s in
earlier stages of development.  Biogen is continuing to look for early-stage compounds to
add to its pipeline, Chief Financial Officer Paul Clancy said
today in a telephone interview. The company is interested in
acquisitions and licensing deals, he said.  “The ingredients for success there are being really good
technology pickers of the asset,” Clancy said. “If they’re
great ideas, we will fund them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
