Matt Garza got the win in his debut
for the  Texas Rangers  as they beat the New York Yankees 3-1.  Garza (1-0) gave up one run on five hits while striking out
five in 7 1/3 innings at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas,
last night. The 29-year-old right-hander arrived in Texas three
days ago from the  Chicago Cubs  with a 63-62 record and 3.80
earned run average over eight Major League Baseball seasons.  Yankees starter Andy Pettitte passed  Sandy Koufax  to tie
 Kevin Brown  for 39th place on the all-time strikeouts list.
Pettitte passed Koufax’s career mark of 2,396 when he struck out
Geovany Soto in the second inning. Dennis Eckersley has 38th
place with 2,401 strikeouts.  Pettitte (7-8) allowed two runs on eight hits and struck
out two in six innings for the Yankees.  A.J. Pierzynski hit a run-scoring single in the first
inning and blasted a home run in the sixth to give the Rangers a
2-1 lead.  David Murphy  tallied his 11th home run of the season
in the eighth inning to complete the scoring.  Robinson Cano  drove in  Brett Gardner  in the sixth inning
for the Yankees’ only run.  At Citi Field in New York, Atlanta Braves pitcher Tim Hudson fractured his ankle when Mets runner Eric Young Jr.
stepped on the back of his lower leg as he raced across first
base. Hudson was covering the base for teammate Freddie Freeman.  Hudson fell as his ankle was driven into the ground.
Emergency crews carted the 38-year-old pitcher off the field. He
will have surgery on the ankle when the swelling subsides, the
team said.  Hudson (8-7) allowed two runs on four hits and struck out
nine in 7 2/3 innings as the Braves beat the Mets 8-2.  Jeremy Hefner (4-8) gave up six runs on six hits and struck
out three in 4 1/3 innings for the Mets (44-53).  To contact the reporter on this story:
