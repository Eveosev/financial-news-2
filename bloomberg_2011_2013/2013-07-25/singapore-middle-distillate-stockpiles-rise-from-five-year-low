Middle-distillate stockpiles
rebounded 21 percent from the lowest level in more than five
years in  Singapore , Asia’s largest oil-trading and storage
center, according to a unit of the Trade and Industry Ministry.  Onshore inventories including gasoil and kerosene increased
by 1.5 million barrels to 8.5 million in the week ended
yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement today. Supplies were at 7 million in the prior
seven days, the least since May 2008.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels , including fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, rose 1.6 million
barrels, or 8.5 percent, to 20.5 million, the data show. That’s
the first gain in five weeks.  Light-distillate supplies including naphtha, reformate and
gasoline were up 1.1 million barrels, or 13 percent, at 9.1
million, according to the data. That’s the biggest gain since
the week to March 20.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners, oil traders and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, IE Singapore said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
