Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) , owner of
the Janus, Intech and Perkins funds, promoted Bruce Koepfgen to
president effective Aug. 1 and named Jennifer J. McPeek, the
company’s treasurer, to replace him a chief financial officer.  Koepfgen, a former chief executive officer of  Allianz SE (ALV) ’s
Oppenheimer Capital unit hired by Janus in June 2011, will focus
on business leadership, the Denver-based firm said today in a
statement.  Janus today reported a 32 percent decline in second-quarter
net income to $15.8 million, or 8 cents a share, from $23.4
million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. Investors withdrew
a net $5.4 billion, the 16th consecutive quarter of client
redemptions. Earnings were reduced by 6 cents a share by costs
associated with the early retirement of debt and the decline in
value of  seed capital .  To contact the reporter on this story:
