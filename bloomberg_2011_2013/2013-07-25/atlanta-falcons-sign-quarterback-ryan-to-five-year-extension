Matt Ryan  agreed to a five-year
contract extension with the  Atlanta Falcons  as the National
Football League team prepared to open training camp.  Financial terms of the agreement with the quarterback
weren’t disclosed in a statement from the team yesterday. The
deal is worth as much as $103.8 million and will pay Ryan $63
million in the first three years, ESPN reported, citing people
it didn’t identify.  The 28-year-old Ryan, who had one year remaining on his
rookie contract, guided the Falcons to last season’s National
Football Conference championship game in which the team lost to
the San Francisco 49ers after leading 17-0 at halftime.  He set single-season franchise passing records with 4,719
yards, 422 completions and 32 touchdown passes. He led the NFL
with a 68.6 completion percentage as the Falcons finished with a
13-3 record and their second NFC South division title.  The Falcons, who never had back-to-back winning seasons
prior to drafting Ryan third overall out of Boston College in
2008, have posted five consecutive winning seasons. Atlanta is
planning to move into a new $1 billion stadium for the 2017
season.  In 38 home games with Ryan at quarterback, the Falcons have
a 33-5 record, putting his .868 home winning percentage second
only to  Tom Brady ’s .909 percentage (30-3 record) with  New
England .  To contact the reporter on this story:
