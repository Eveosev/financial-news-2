FastJet Plc (FJET)  said that Stelios Haji-Ioannou plans to boost his holding in the African discount-airline startup to 5.81 percent from under 3 percent.  Haji-Ioannou, the founder of  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , agreed to take
110,334,156 newly issued Fastjet shares at 1 pence instead of
royalty and consultancy payments, the London-based airline said
in a statement today. The new stock will begin trading on July
30, boosting the African airline’s total share capital to about
2.98 billion ordinary shares.  “There is only one continent on earth where low air fares
are not widely available yet,” Haji-Ioannou said in the
statement. “Fastjet has demonstrated that travellers in  Africa 
will react in exactly the same way as consumers elsewhere, to
the availability of low-cost fares.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
