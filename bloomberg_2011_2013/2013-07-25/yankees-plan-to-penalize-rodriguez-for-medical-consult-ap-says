The  New York Yankees  intend to
discipline injured third baseman  Alex Rodriguez  for seeking a
second medical opinion on his injured leg without the team’s
permission, according to the Associated Press.  The penalty has not yet been determined, the AP said today,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the team’s internal
discussions. Yankees General Manager  Brian Cashman  said
yesterday in a statement that Rodriguez violated baseball’s
labor agreement by seeking a second opinion on his left thigh
injury without first notifying the team.  The 37-year-old Rodriguez and the Yankees also agreed to a
timetable for the 14-time All-Star to resume playing minor-league games or simulated games around Aug. 1, according to the
report.  Yankees spokesman Jason Zillo did not immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment on the AP report.  Rodriguez, who has not played at the major league level
since having hip surgery in January, issued a statement today
saying he’d like to return to the MLB team this week. Cashman
said yesterday in a statement that the team wanted him back “as
soon as possible” in response to an ESPN report that the third
baseman suspects the team has conspired with  Major League
Baseball  to keep him sidelined.  A three-time American League Most Valuable Player,
Rodriguez is also at the center of an MLB investigation into
performance-enhancing drugs supplied by the founder of a now-shuttered anti-aging clinic in Florida, according to ESPN.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster, Dex McLuskey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
