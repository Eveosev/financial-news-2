BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Rio Tinto 
Group, the two largest mining companies, are investing in a
$3.43 billion desalination facility that will supply water to
Chileâ€™s Escondida copper mine.  BHP, which owns 57.5 percent of the mine, is investing
$1.97 billion, and Rio Tinto, which owns 30 percent, will
contribute $1.03 billion. Work that includes two pipelines, four
high-pressure pumps and a reservoir at the mine site is
scheduled to begin this month and will be finished in 2017,
according to a statement today from BHP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
