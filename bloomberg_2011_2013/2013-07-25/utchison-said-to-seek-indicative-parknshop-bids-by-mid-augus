Billionaire  Li Ka-shing ’s  Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd. (13)  is asking potential buyers to submit bids for its
ParknShop supermarket chain by mid-August, said three people
with knowledge of the matter.  Hutchison has sent  financial information  about ParknShop to
prospective buyers in Asia and Europe and asked for indicative
offers by Aug. 16, said two of the people, who asked not to be
identified because the process is private.  ParknShop, one of Hong Kong’s two main supermarket chains,
could fetch $3 billion to $4 billion, a person with knowledge of
the matter said earlier this week. Hutchison is considering a
sale because of the unit’s slow growth, and as the conglomerate
seeks to raise cash after recent acquisitions, the person said.
Hutchison has announced $4.7 billion of takeovers in the past
two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Bank of America Corp. are
advising Hutchison on the proposed sale, the people said. Jeremy
Lau, a spokesman for Hutchison, declined to comment on the sale,
as did spokesmen for Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.  The Hong Kong-based company said last week that it’s
conducting a strategic  review  of ParknShop, which had sales of
HK$21.7 billion ($2.8 billion) in 2012.  Exiting ParknShop would help Hutchison free up resources
for investing in faster-growing businesses. The company last
month agreed to acquire  Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s Irish unit for as much
as 850 million euros ($1.1 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
