Yuan  forwards fell after the central
bank lowered the  reference rate  by the most in a week.  The State Council yesterday approved tax breaks for small
companies and reduced fees for exporters after a report by HSBC
Holdings Plc and  Markit Economics  indicated a manufacturing
slowdown worsened in July. The People’s Bank of China weakened
the reference rate by 0.1 percent to 6.1759 per dollar. The
Bloomberg  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against 10
major currencies, rose 0.5 percent yesterday after data showed
new home sales in the U.S. increased to a five-year high in June.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.14 percent
to 6.2815 as of 4:57 p.m. in Hong Kong, trading at a 2.3 percent
 discount  to the onshore spot rate, which rose 0.02 percent to
6.1347, China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices showed. The
currency is allowed to diverge a maximum 1 percent from the
central bank’s fixing. The yuan has appreciated 1.6 percent this
year, the only gainer among Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies.  “The dollar is rebounding and usually the PBOC’s fixing
follows the dollar index move,” said  Ju Wang , a Hong Kong-based
strategist at HSBC. “We think the policy bias is for a stable
 renminbi  but they probably don’t mind a small depreciation just
to help the export sector.” HSBC predicts the yuan will drop to
6.16 by year-end, Wang said.  Foreign direct investment in China will be little changed
from last year, Cao Hongying, an official with the foreign
investment department of the Ministry of Commerce, said in
Beijing today. Investment has increased 4.9 percent to $61.98
billion in the first six months of 2013 from a year earlier,
official data show.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.04 percent
to 6.1371 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month
implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, increased two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.5 percent.  The yuan climbed two places to No. 11 for transactions in
the global payments system with a record 0.87 percent market
share in June, according to a statement from the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication yesterday. The
currency overtook Thailand’s baht and the Norwegian Krone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
