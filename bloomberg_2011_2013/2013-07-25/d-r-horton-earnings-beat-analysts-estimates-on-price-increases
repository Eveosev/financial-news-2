D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) , the largest U.S.
homebuilder by volume, reported fiscal third-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates as demand for homes increased.  Net income was $146 million, or 42 cents a share, for the
three months ended June 30, compared with $787.8 million, or
$2.22, a year earlier, when the Fort Worth, Texas-based company
booked $716.7 million in non-cash deferred tax assets, according
to a statement today. The average  estimate  of 17 analysts was 34
cents a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. builders are benefiting as a tight inventory of
existing properties boosts demand for new houses. Sales of new
homes rose to an annual pace of 497,000 in June, a five-year
high, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. D.R. Horton,
under Chief Executive Officer Donald J. Tomnitz, has used its
size advantage to reduce costs and increase market share by
accelerating land purchases ahead of smaller competitors.  “Our homebuilding and financial services operations
delivered strong results again this quarter,” Chairman Donald
R. Horton said in the statement. Rising  sales (NHSLTOT)  prices reflected
“pricing power across most of our markets and increased demand
from move-up buyers.”  D.R. Horton’s homebuilding revenue rose to $1.6 billion
from $1.1 billion a year earlier. It sold 6,464 homes, up from
4,957.  The average price climbed to $268,000 from $225,000 a year
earlier. Orders increased to 6,822 homes from 6,079.  The results were announced before markets opened. D.R.
Horton fell 2.8 percent to $21.20 yesterday. The shares have
gained 7.2 percent this year, compared with a 0.2 percent
advance for the 11-company Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite
Homebuilding Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
