(Corrects to remove reference to internal memo in final
paragraph.)  Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co .,
the supermarket known as A&P that emerged from bankruptcy, has
hired  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  to help it review strategic
alternatives that may include selling itself.  A&P also may raise new capital from investors, consider new
business partners or refinance the company, according to an
internal memo reviewed by  Bloomberg News .  The company, which owns grocery chains on the East Coast
including Pathmark and The Food Emporium, emerged from
bankruptcy reorganization last year. A&P, with more than 300
locations, has attempted to boost sales with a wellness program
and more natural foods as it faces increasing competition from
such big-box retailers as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp.  “Having strengthened the core of our business, we are now
focused on the capital required for future growth,” Chairman
Greg Mays said in an e-mailed statement. “Our goal is to build
on our positive momentum and grow A&P in a way that benefits our
customers, associates, suppliers and partners.”  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that A&P is
seeking to sell itself for as much as $1 billion, citing a
person familiar with the matter. Potential acquirers include
Kroger Co., Koninklijke Ahold NV and Cerberus Capital Management
LP, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
