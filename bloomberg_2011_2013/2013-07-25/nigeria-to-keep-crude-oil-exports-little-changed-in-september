Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil
producer, will keep daily crude exports for September little
changed from August, according to loading programs obtained by
Bloomberg News covering 17 grades excluding Bonny Light.  The nation will ship 63 cargoes totaling 1.94 million
barrels a day, the schedules showed. Exports will comprise 12
consignments of Qua Iboe grade, seven of Agbami, five each of
Brass, Akpo, Bonga and Forcados, four of Usan, three each of
Amenam, Erha, Escravos and Antan, two each of Yoho and Okono,
and one each of Abo, EA, Okwori and Pennington. The cargoes
range in size from 250,000 to 1 million barrels.  It remains unclear whether Nigeria will export Bonny Light
in September, four traders with knowledge of the loading program
said. No shipments for this grade were planned for August.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  declared force majeure on exports of
Bonny Light after closing the Nembe Creek Trunkline on April 15
to remove connections oil thieves used on the pipeline. Force
majeure is a legal step that protects a company from liability
when it can’t fulfill a contract for reasons beyond its control.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
