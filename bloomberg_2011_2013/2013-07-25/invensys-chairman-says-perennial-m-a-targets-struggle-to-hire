Takeover targets can “struggle to
get top talent” if takeover speculation persists, Chairman Sir
Nigel Rudd tells shareholders at AGM.  * Rudd says Invensys no longer a U.K. company given U.S.
connections: “It just happens to have a headquarters in the
U.K.”
* Foreign capital behind much of U.K. industry and refutes
Invensys takeover would be a “sell out” of British technology:
Rudd
* No further comment on takeover progress.  NSN MPTU4K6K50ZB  To contact the reporter on this story:
