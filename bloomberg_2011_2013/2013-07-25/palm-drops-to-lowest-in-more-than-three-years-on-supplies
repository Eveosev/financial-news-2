Palm tumbled to the lowest level in
more than three years as global supplies of the world’s most-consumed cooking oil climb the most since 1999 and demand
expands at the slowest pace in more than a decade.  Futures slumped as much as 3.2 percent to 2,151 ringgit
($672) a metric ton in intraday trading on the Bursa  Malaysia 
Derivatives in  Kuala Lumpur , a level not seen since October
2009, before closing at 2,170 ringgit. Soybean oil, an
alternative, fell to the lowest level since 2010.  Prices of palm, used in everything from candy to biofuel,
are extending a yearlong  bear market  as world  stockpiles  are
poised to surge 21 percent to a record 9.5 million tons by the
end of 2013-2014 and  demand  expands 4.4 percent, the least in 12
years, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Rising soybean
oil supply will add to the glut, with U.S. growers set to reap
their biggest-ever crop of the beans from September. The price
slide may cut costs at companies such as Unilever.  “It’s a double whammy,”  Carey Wong , an analyst at OCBC
Investment Research Pte., said by phone from  Singapore  today.
“We see supplies of substitute oils rising and also on the
demand side we do see a potential drop off.”  Futures plunged 26 percent in the past year as the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Index of eight agricultural commodities  dropped  27
percent and the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
advanced 23 percent.  Production Forecast  Palm production, accounting for 35 percent of cooking oil
supply, will expand 5 percent to 58.1 million tons in 2013-2014,
USDA data show. Output doubled over the previous decade, led by
 Indonesia  and Malaysia. The predicted stockpiles are  equal  to 17
percent of demand, the highest level since 1989, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Supplies of  soybean oil , the second most-consumed edible
oil, will rise to a  record  for a fifth year and reach 44.6
million tons, the USDA predicts.  Palm reached a three-month high of 2,491 ringgit on June 20
as buyers accelerated purchases before the start of the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan in July. Stockpiles in Malaysia, the
biggest producer after Indonesia, fell to the lowest level in
more than two years in June as output dropped in the biggest-producing state, industry data show.  Demand slowed this month as buyers may have stocked up in
May and June for the Eid celebrations, according to Ong Chee Ting and Chai Li Shin, analysts at Maybank Investment Bank Bhd.
Shipments from Malaysia fell 7 percent in the first 25 days of
July from the same period in June, said surveyor Intertek.  Growing Cycle  Palm oil  may drop to 2,000 ringgit after July as Ramadan
demand subsides and output increases,  Dorab Mistry , director at
Godrej International Ltd., said on May 21. While palm is
produced year-round, supply typically accelerates in the second
half because of growing cycles.  The  discount  to soybean oil shrank to $283.25 a ton today,
compared with an average of about $305 in the three months ended
June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Soybean oil
futures fell 1.2 percent to 43.59 cents a pound.  “With demand and the near-term export data not so strong,
the worry is that the narrowing of the discount may reduce the
attractiveness of palm as an edible oil versus soybean oil,”
said Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd.  Unilever (UNA) , the second-biggest consumer goods company, sees
low- to mid-single digit commodity-cost inflation in 2013, down
from high single-digit increase across food, home and personal
care products in 2012, according to the company in January.  Lower prices may further cut global  food  costs tracked by
the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization. The Rome-based group’s food price index is 11 percent below the record
reached in February 2011, with its oils and fat  index  dropping
10 percent in the past year.  Refined palm oil for January delivery lost 0.9 percent to
5,516 yuan ($899) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , the
lowest level at close for the most-active contract since March
2009. Soybean oil fell 1.4 percent to end at 7,142  yuan  a ton,
the lowest since October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
