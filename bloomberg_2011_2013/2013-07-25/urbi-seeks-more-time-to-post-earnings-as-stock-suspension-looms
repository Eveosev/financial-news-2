Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB (URBI*) ,
Mexico’s third-biggest homebuilder, said it won’t meet this
week’s second-quarter earnings report deadline and will ask
regulators for more time to avoid a suspension of stock trading.  The builder, which is preparing to restructure debt, is
postponing the report as it reviews  asset  values, including an
estimated 32.4 billion pesos ($2.57 billion) in inventory and
12.2 billion pesos in accounts receivable, according to a
regulatory filing today. The company said the review includes
more than 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of land, the value of
which is subject to change after the government introduced a new
housing subsidy policy last month.  Urbi is seeking a grace period under a rule that allows
companies as many as 20 days extra to file earnings results
under special circumstances, spokesman David Aguilar said in a
telephone interview from  Mexico  City.  The Mexicali, Mexico-based company is one of three
homebuilders in the country seeking to restructure debt amid a
shift in government housing policy, which is reallocating
federal subsidies and government-backed mortgages to emphasize
urban development. Those that accumulated large reserves of
inexpensive land outside of cities are struggling to adapt as
inventory loses value and the companies are forced develop new
products.  The policy move is a reaction to a wave of home abandonment
that has swept subsidized commuter towns, where residents say
they have grown tired of hours-long commutes to their jobs in
the city.  Urbi plans to publish the second-quarter results “as soon
as the previously mentioned reviews are completed,” according
to the filing.  The stock exchange can suspend  stock trading  of companies
that fail to meet this week’s reporting deadline without an
extension from regulators, Francisco Valle, head of promotion
and issuers at the country’s bourse, said in an e-mailed
response to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
