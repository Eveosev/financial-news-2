Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, joined a $54 million venture
to build an office in Raleigh, North Carolina, as the company
invests institutional funds to generate fee income.  Prudential Real Estate Investors will fund the 11-story
property with Dominion Realty Partners, PREI said today in a
statement. The 236,000-square-foot (21,900-square-meter) office,
called Charter Square, will be in Raleigh’s business district.  “Raleigh has become one of the best cities to live, work
and play, making it comparable to other tech hubs,”  Soultana
Reigle , managing director at Newark, New Jersey-based
Prudential’s real estate unit, said in the release. “These
facts and the strength of Dominion Realty Partners make Charter
Square a compelling investment opportunity for our fund.”  Insurers including American International Group Inc.,
Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America and  MetLife Inc. (MET)  have
been betting on commercial property as an alternative to bonds
and a hedge against inflation. MetLife, the largest U.S. life
insurer, said today that it bought Broadstone Laurel Highlands,
a 300-unit, multifamily complex in Lorton, Virginia.  MetLife acquired the property from the Alliance Residential
Fund I, the New York-based insurer said in a statement.  Steve
Taylor  and Terence O’Connell of MetLife’s Washington office led
the company’s efforts on the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
