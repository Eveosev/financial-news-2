The Bank of  Italy  urged  Banca
Popolare di Milano Scrl , Italy’s oldest cooperative bank, to
review its governance, two people familiar with the matter said.  The central bank gave Popolare di Milano a partially
unfavorable result during an inspection, said one of the people,
who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public.
The Bank of Italy asked managers to resume talks to introduce
more balanced governance, the people said.  Popolare di Milano rose as much as 3.8 percent in Milan
trading after Italian news agency Radiocor reported the
decision, which fueled speculation the bank may resume a plan to
convert into a joint-stock company. Chief Executive Officer
Piero Montani abandoned a plan in May to bring in proportional
shareholder voting and transform the bank into an “SpA” after
opposition from unions and employees.  “BPM is and must remain a cooperative bank,” said Massimo
Masi, general secretary of the UILCA labor union, in a statement
today. “We are available to review eventual governance changes
that will not favor funds too much,” he said. A Bank of Italy
official declined to comment. A spokesman for Popolare di Milano
didn’t respond to calls and e-mail requests for comment.  The bank was 2.5 percent  higher  at 39.4 cents by 5:01 p.m.
in Milan, paring this year’s decline to 13 percent and valuing
the company at 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion).  The Bank of Italy also started a procedure to sanction
supervisory board members for interfering in management board
decisions, according to one of the people.  To contact the reporters on this story:
