The  International Monetary Fund 
decided not to file a brief supporting  Argentina  in a legal
battle over the nation’s defaulted debt because such a move may
have breached a duty of neutrality the fund has to its members,
an IMF spokesman said.  “The lack of U.S. support means that the filing could
potentially place the fund in the middle of a dispute between
two fund members, which would breach its duty of neutrality,”
IMF spokesman  William Murray  told reporters in Washington today.
“The lack of U.S. support in this case could undermine the
effectiveness of the fund’s filing.”  Argentina bonds tumbled the most in five months yesterday
after the announcement, which came three days after Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  said she’d recommend that the IMF
board file its first-ever friend-of-the-court brief to the U.S.
Supreme Court in support of Argentina’s request for a review of
a lower court ruling.  Separately, Murray said the IMF has not had contacts with
the new Egyptian authorities for a potential loan and is waiting
for a decision by its member states on how they deal with the
government. He also said there had been no in-depth talks with
Ukraine since April on the measures for a potential loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
