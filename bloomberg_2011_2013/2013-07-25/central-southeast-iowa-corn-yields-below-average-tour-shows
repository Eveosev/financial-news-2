Corn yields across the central and
southeastern fields in  Iowa , the biggest U.S. grower, are
smaller than average as rain in June damaged ear development,
field inspections showed.  Yields measured in six fields from Ames to Mount Pleasant,
Iowa, averaged 173.3 bushels an acre, inspections during an
annual Midwest crop tour run by Doane Advisory Services Co.
showed. That’s 2.6 percent below the average of 177.9 bushels
from 2007 to 2011, and up from an average of 139.5 last year,
when drought damaged crops.  “Smaller ear size limits the crop’s ability to reach full
yield potential,” Marty Foreman, a senior economist for St.
Louis-basedDoane, said from the tour in Mt Pleasant, Iowa.
Observations of historicaly high-plant population “leaves the
potential for above-average yields with normal weather in August
and September,” he said.  Soybean yields averaged 49.5 bushels an acre in the area
measured today. That’s up 6.5 percent from the average in the
five years ended 2011 of 46.5 bushels.  “Soybean fields in central Iowa were some of the best we
saw this week in Iowa,” said  Bill Nelson , a senior economist
from Doane.  Corn prices fell to a 33-month low today in  Chicago , and
soybeans tumbled to the lowest since February 2012 on
speculation that rain and cool weather will aid crops in the
Midwest. The declines may reduce food prices and costs for
producers of livestock feed and ethanol. U.S. farmers will
harvest a record 13.95 billion bushels of corn and 3.42 billion
bushels of soybeans, the Department of Agriculture estimates.  The U.S. is the world’s largest grower of both crops. The
government will release its first field-based estimates of
production on Aug. 12.
