CAL Bank Ltd., the second-best
performing stock on the Ghanaian bourse this year, rallied to
the highest in more than five years after the lender said profit
more than doubled in the first half of 2013.  The shares added 2.2 percent to 93 pesewas by the close in
the capital, Accra, the highest since May 2008. Trading volume
was almost 29 percent of the three-month daily average.  Net income increased to 42.1 million cedis ($20 million)
from 19 million cedis a year earlier, CAL Bank said in an e-mailed statement today. Net interest income, the money banks
make from loans, advanced to 69.3 million cedis from 31.2
million cedis a year before.  “We think CAL still has an upside, up to 1 cedi a share
this year.” Nana Kofi Agyeman Gyamfi, a stock trader at Merban
Stockbrokers Ltd. in Accra, said by phone. “We expect them to
sustain this performance trajectory to the end of the year.”  The bank has a price-to-earnings ratio of 6.6, while the
Ghana Stock Exchange  Composite Index (GGSECI)  is at 16.1. The stock has
more than doubled this year, compared with a 48 percent increase
on the benchmark gauge, which is Africa’s best performer this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
