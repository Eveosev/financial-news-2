Braylon Edwards will sign a one-year
contract with the  New York  Jets after undergoing a physical
examination yesterday, the New York Post reported, citing a
person familiar with the transaction.  The decision to offer the wide receiver a deal comes a day
after Santonio Holmes was placed on the physically unable to
perform list, the Post said.  Edwards, 30, played with the Jets in 2009 and 2010 and
returned for the final three games of last season when he had 10
catches for 125 yards, the Post said.  Edwards, who began the last National Football League season
with the Seattle Seahawks, has 359 career receptions for 5,522
yards and 40 touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
