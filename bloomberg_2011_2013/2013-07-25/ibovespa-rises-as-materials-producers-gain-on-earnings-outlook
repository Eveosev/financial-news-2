The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  rose amid speculation
that this year’s worst-performing major equity index will
rebound as Brazilian commodity exporters report earnings that
may have been boosted by a depreciating local currency.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled oil producer,
advanced to a one-month high. Papermaker  Suzano Papel e Celulose
SA  gained the most in two weeks. Cosmetics maker  Natura
Cosmeticos SA (NATU3)  jumped after second-quarter profit exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  The Ibovespa  added  0.4 percent to 48,584.89 at 12:15 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, with 42 of the measure’s 71 stocks advancing. The
real was little changed at 2.2502 per dollar. Commodities
producers, which account for about 38 percent of the benchmark’s
weighting, were among the best performers even as the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials fell 0.5 percent.  “There’s optimism about exporters’ quarterly earnings that
will be released in the coming weeks,” Ricardo Pinto Nogueira,
the head of operations at brokerage firm Souza Barros, said by
phone from  Sao Paulo . Traders are speculating that the real’s
9.4 percent drop against the dollar during three-month period
ended in June boosted revenue, he said.  Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is also known, gained 1.5
percent to 16.64 reais. Suzano rose 1.8 percent to 8.04 reais.
Natura climbed 2.4 percent to 45.35 reais.  The Ibovespa has tumbled 20 percent in 2013, the worst
performance among the 20 biggest equity benchmarks tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
