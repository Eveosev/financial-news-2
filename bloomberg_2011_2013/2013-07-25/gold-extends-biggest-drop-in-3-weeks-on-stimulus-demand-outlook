Gold gained for the first time in
three days after a report showed more Americans filed for
 unemployment benefits , boosting prospects that the  Federal
Reserve  will maintain stimulus measures to spur economic growth.  U.S.  jobless claims  rose by 7,000 to 343,000 in the week
ended July 20, Labor Department said today. Economists projected
340,000, the median of 49 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Gold
rallied 7.9 percent this month through yesterday, heading for
the biggest monthly gain since January 2012, after Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said it’s too early to decide whether to begin
scaling back bond purchases in September.  “It’s all about U.S. data and the Fed,”Chris Gaffney,
the senior market Strategist at EverBank Wealth Management, said
in a telephone interview from  St. Louis . “Today’s jobless
numbers are supporting prices.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$1,323.10 an ounce at 10:35 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Trading was 30 percent higher than the average for the past 100
days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Prices slumped 21 percent this year through yesterday as
the dollar gained 4.5 percent against 10 currencies. The metal
also fell as some investors lost faith in bullion as a store of
value.  Precious metals will remain under pressure in the second
half of the year as investors reduce their holdings further, ABN
Amro Group NV said in a report today, forecasting  gold prices 
will average $1,000 next year and $840 in 2015.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$20.105 an ounce on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
