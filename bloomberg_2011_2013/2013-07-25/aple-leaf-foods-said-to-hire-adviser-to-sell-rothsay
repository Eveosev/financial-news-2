Maple Leaf Foods Inc. (MFI) , the Canadian
producer of foods ranging from Black Forest ham to bagels, has
put its animal-rendering business up for sale, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  Maple Leaf hired investment bank  RBC Capital Markets  to
sell Rothsay Rendering, which recycles inedible animal parts
into feed and fuel, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the talks are confidential. The unit is
valued at as much as C$250 million ($243 million), they said.  Rothsay is part of Toronto-based Maple Leaf’s agribusiness
division, which reported adjusted operating earnings of C$68.4
million in 2012, a 16.4 percent decline from a year earlier. The
company attributed the fall to an increase in operating costs,
including raw materials.  Maple Leaf this week announced the sale of its commercial
turkey farms and hatchery operations to Canada-based Ernald
Enterprises Ltd. and Cuddy Farms Ltd., respectively, for
undisclosed sums.  Maple Leaf’s  shares  have risen 27 percent this year, giving
the firm a market value of C$2.1 billion. Last month, Michael Palmer, an analyst at Veritas Investment Research in Toronto,
said in an interview with  Bloomberg News  that the company would
be an attractive acquisition for Austin, Minnesota-based  Hormel
Foods Corp. (HRL) , maker of Spam lunch meat.  A Maple Leaf spokesman declined to comment on a Rothsay
sale as did a spokeswoman for RBC, the investment-banking unit
of Royal Bank of  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
