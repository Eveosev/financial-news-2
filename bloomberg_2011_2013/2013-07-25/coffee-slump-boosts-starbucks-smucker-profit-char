The two-year slump in coffee prices
is providing a profit boost for retailers including  Starbucks
Corp. (SBUX) , J.M. Smucker Co. and  Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. (DNKN)  as costs
decline and consumers buy more.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows arabica-coffee futures plummeted
60 percent since reaching a 14-year high in May 2011. Over the
same period, shares of Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee-shop operator, surged 88 percent in  New York , and Smuckers,
owner of Folgers, the best-selling U.S. brand, rose 47 percent.
Dunkin’ Brands has shares more than doubled since an initial
public offering in July 2011.  “Coffee costs have been a benefit to us all year,” Troy Alstead, the chief financial officer at Seattle-based Starbucks,
said in an interview. Cheaper beans added 0.6 percentage point
to operating profit margins that expanded to 16.4 percent in the
three months ended June 30, up from 14.9 percent a year earlier,
the company said yesterday in its fiscal third-quarter earnings
statement.  Global coffee production will exceed demand by 4.46 million
bags in the 2013-2014 season, the fourth straight year of
production surpluses that will send inventories to the highest
since 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. A bag
weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  Canton, Massachusetts-based Dunkin’ Brands, which reported
yesterday that net income doubled in the quarter ended June 29,
said franchisees using a purchasing cooperative are benefitting
from cheaper coffee.  “Significantly lower” coffee prices reduced commodity
costs for Orrville, Ohio-based Smucker, the company said in an
earnings statement on June 6. Operating profit in its U.S.
retail coffee unit, the company’s biggest, jumped 18 percent to
$147.7 million during the fiscal fourth quarter ended April 30,
the company said June 6. While lower retail prices reduced
coffee revenue by 1 percent, Smucker sold more coffee as volumes
grew 6 percent, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
