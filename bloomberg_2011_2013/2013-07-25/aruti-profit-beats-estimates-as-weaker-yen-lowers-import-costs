Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the
nation’s biggest carmaker by volume, reported first-quarter
profit that beat analyst estimates after a weaker  Japanese yen 
lowered import costs.  Net income  at  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) ’s Indian unit rose 49
percent to 6.32 billion rupees ($107 million) in the three
months ended June, the New Delhi-based company said in a
statement today. That beat the 6.18 billion-rupee median of 45
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The  carmaker  benefited from the yen’s decline against the
rupee in the 12 months through June, which makes components
imported from Japan cheaper. Maruti’s local deliveries dropped
6.8 percent in the quarter after  India’s economy  expanded 5
percent in year ended March, the slowest pace in a decade.  “The favorable currency movement provided a lot of cushion
to our margin estimates and could have offset minor hiccups,”
Kaushal Maroo and Siddhartha Bera, analysts at Emkay Global
Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai, wrote in a June 13 report.
“Post three years of poor volumes, the rebound is going to be
very strong.”  Shares of Maruti fell 0.1 percent to 1,414 rupees at the
close in Mumbai. The stock has declined 5.1 percent this year,
compared with a 2 percent advance in the S&P BSE Sensex.  Net sales fell 5.1 percent to 99.95 billion rupees, lagging
behind the 101.5 billion-rupee median of 45 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The earnings include the results of unit
Suzuki Powertrain  India  Ltd., which was absorbed in the year
ended March 31.  The yen declined about 14 percent against the rupee in the
12 months through June 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
