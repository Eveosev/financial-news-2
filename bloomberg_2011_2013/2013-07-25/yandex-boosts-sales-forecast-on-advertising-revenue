Yandex NV (YNDX) ,  Russia ’s largest Internet
search engine, increased its full-year sales forecast after
second-quarter profit jumped 47 percent on higher advertising
revenue.  Revenue will grow 34 percent to 38 percent this year,
Yandex, based in The Hague, said today in a statement. It had
previously projected growth of 30 percent to 35 percent. Net
income rose to 2.92 billion rubles ($89 million) from 1.98
billion rubles a year earlier.  Yandex, whose market share in Russia is twice that of
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s, is benefiting from rising demand for Internet
advertising in the country. Online advertising is set to grow an
average 26 percent annually through 2015, according to
ZenithOptimedia data.  Revenue last quarter rose 35 percent to 9.2 billion rubles.
Analysts predicted sales of 9.02 billion rubles, according to
the average of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company said today co-founder and Chief Technology
Officer Ilya Segalovich, 48, is on life support after falling
into a coma, with no sign of brain activity. Segalovich owns
about 2.5 percent of the company.  “Mr. Segalovich had been diagnosed with a treatable form
of cancer and was responding well to treatment and working a
full schedule,” the Russian company said in an earlier
statement at 10:55 a.m. Moscow time.  Yandex  shares  have advanced 47 percent this year in New
York, valuing the company at $10.4 billion. The stock  jumped  as
much as 7.4 percent and traded up 2.5 percent at $31.64 at 11:48
a.m. in New York, heading for the highest closing price since
Aug. 4, 2011, as trading volume exceeded an average daily level
for the past three months by 19 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
