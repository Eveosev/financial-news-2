McGraw Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI)  rose on
earnings that increased 42 percent, with shares exceeding the
level prior to the U.S.  Justice Department ’s lawsuit against the
owner of the world’s largest credit rater.  McGraw Hill  climbed  1.04 percent to $60.10 in  New York . The
stock traded at the highest level since 2007 and has surpassed
the price before the Justice Department’s Feb. 4 action, which
sent shares down the most in 25 years. The New York-based
company denies the claims.  The stock trades at 16.4 times earnings, down from 17.1
before the lawsuit was filed.  McGraw Hill reported today that earnings increased 42
percent and boosted its 2013 outlook amid higher bond issuance,
which has increased demand for ratings.  Second-quarter net income rose to $250 million, up from
$177 million, the company said today in a statement distributed
by PR Newswire. Earnings excluding certain items were 92 cents a
share, topping the average estimate of 82 cents in a Bloomberg
 survey  of seven analysts.  Higher bond sales increased profit as companies took
advantage of cheap borrowing costs. Yields on corporate bonds
fell to an unprecedented low of 3.09 percent on May 2, according
to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate & High
Yield Index. Issuance slowed in June as  interest rates  rose
after the  Federal Reserve  signaled it might reduce its $85
billion of monthly bond purchases.  Raised Outlook  McGraw Hill raised its 2013 adjusted earnings per share
guidance to a range of $3.15 to $3.25 from a range of $3.10 to
$3.20, according to the statement.  Revenue at S&P climbed 24 percent to $599 million, from
$483 million a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The 125-year-old McGraw Hill has transformed into a
financial services provider after selling its publishing
division to  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  in March for $2.4
billion. That leaves S&P at the center of the firm, which the
U.S. Justice Department sued in February, alleging that it lied
about its ratings being free of conflicts of interest because it
downplayed credit risks.  Douglas Peterson, president of the ratings unit, will
become chief executive officer Nov. 1, succeeding Harold “Terry” McGraw III, who will retain his role as chairman after
leading the company since 1998.  The U.S. is seeking as much as $5 billion from McGraw Hill
in its lawsuit, alleging the company deliberately understated
the risk of bonds backed by loans made to the riskiest borrowers
to win business from Wall Street banks.  Shares of  Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , the second largest ratings agency,
traded at $64.56 in New York. Moody’s surged 3.8 percent
yesterday after reporting second-quarter profit rose 31 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
