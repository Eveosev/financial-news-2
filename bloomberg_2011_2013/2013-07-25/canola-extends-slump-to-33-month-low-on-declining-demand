Canola extended its slump to a 33-month low, tracking declines in soybeans and palm oil, on signs
of slowing global demand for oilseeds and improving prospects
for the crop in  Canada .  Exports of canola from Canada, the world’s top grower and
shipper, were down 14 percent in the 10 months through May,
compared with a year earlier, government  data  show.  Mexico , the
third-largest canola  buyer , reduced purchases by 2.2 percent in
the marketing year that ends July 31. Canadian farmers will
boost production of the oilseed by 9.7 percent this year to 14.6
million metric tons, the highest since the record harvest of
14.61 million in 2011.  “Export demand has really dried up the last month or so
for canola,” Chuck Penner, the owner of LeftField Commodity
Research, said in a telephone interview from Winnipeg.  Canola futures for November settlement fell 2.3 percent to
close at C$493.70 ($481.05) at 1:47 p.m. on ICE Futures Exchange
in Winnipeg, after touching $493.10, the lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 8, 2010. Prices have tumbled 7.7
percent in July.  Palm-oil futures in  Malaysia  are down 26 percent in the
past 12 months, touching the lowest price today since October
2009. Soybean-oil futures tumbled to a 33-month low today in
 Chicago , down 17 percent from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
