Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
index headed for its second decline in three days, as precision-instruments makers led losses among the gauge’s 33 subsectors.  The Topix index fell 0.1 percent to 1,218.20 as of 9:06
a.m. in Tokyo. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  retreated 0.2
percent to 14,709.46.  The Topix index surged 42 percent this year, making it the
world’s best-performing major equity benchmark, as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
pushed to end deflation and restore sustainable growth.  After plunging as much as 18 percent from a May 22 high,
the gauge rebounded amid optimism Abe will push through reforms
after winning upper-house elections on July 21. Investor
attention is now shifting to whether the government will cut
corporate taxes, ease regulations, loosen  labor laws , join the
Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement and raise the
 sales tax  as planned.  The gauge traded at 1.31 times book value yesterday,
compared with 2.48 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.70
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
