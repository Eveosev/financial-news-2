BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY) , maker of the Z10
and Q10 smartphones, informed 250 workers in a Waterloo,
Ontario, product-testing facility that they would be fired.  The dismissals are part of BlackBerry’s turnaround plan to
improve profits, Lisette Kwong, a company spokeswoman, said
today in an e-mail. The department affected by the job cuts
supports manufacturing, research and development, she said.
BlackBerry has about 12,700 employees.  BlackBerry is scaling back after the touch-screen Z10,
introduced in February, failed to become a hit with consumers.
The company is counting on the Q10, which sports a physical
keyboard like earlier devices, to keep longtime customers loyal.  The company, based in Waterloo, is also preparing for more
executive departures as retention bonuses expire and Chief
Executive Officer Thorsten Heins sets tougher targets for
managers, a person familiar with the matter said this month.
 David Smith , executive vice president of enterprise mobile
computing, has resigned for personal reasons, Kwong said.  CTV News reported the product-testing firings earlier
today, and the Wall Street Journal reported Smith’s departure
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
