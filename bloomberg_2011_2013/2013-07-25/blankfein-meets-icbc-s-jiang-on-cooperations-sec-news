Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein met with  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  Chairman  Jiang Jianqing  during a
recent visit to the country to discuss future cooperation,
Shanghai Securities News reported today.  Blankfein reiterated that Goldman Sachs remains committed
to  China  and the firm has not changed its business strategy for
the country, even after ending a seven-year investment in ICBC
in May, the newspaper said, citing an interview with the CEO.  Goldman Sachs, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp.
have cut Chinese holdings as tighter Basel III capital rules
make holding minority stakes in banks more expensive. Goldman
Sachs reaped about $12 billion in sales proceeds and dividends
from its $2.58 billion investment in ICBC, according Macquarie
Capital Securities Ltd.  The New York-based bank sold its ICBC stake in a “mild and
consistent manner” and sales were timed to avoid hurting the
Chinese lender’s reputation, the newspaper reported, citing
Blankfein.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Aipeng Soo in
