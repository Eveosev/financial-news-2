CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched
TV network, said its board approved an additional $5.1 billion
in stock repurchases, after completing most of a previous
authorization. The shares rose.  The total amount in the current buyback plan is $6 billion,
New York-based CBS said today in a statement.  CBS, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , is stepping up
the buybacks after agreeing to sell its billboard operations in
Asia and Europe to the Los Angeles-based private equity firm
 Platinum Equity . CBS, which said it has returned $3.75 billion
to shareholders since January 2011, plans to fold the rest of
its billboard division into a separate public company.  CBS rose as much as 1.7 percent in extended trading to
$53.40. The  stock  was little changed at $52.49 at the close in
New York and has climbed 38 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
