Arabica coffee rebounded in  New York 
after falling the most in five weeks yesterday as most growing
areas in  Brazil , the world’s leading producer, escaped damaged
from frost. Sugar advanced.  While frost formed in some coffee growing areas of Parana,
the state’s production accounts for only 3.5 percent of Brazil’s
total, according to data from forecaster Somar Meteorologia and
the government. Frost also reached corn, wheat and sugar cane
growing areas in the states of Parana, Mato Grosso do Sul and
Santa Catarina yesterday, Marco Antonio dos Santos, an
agronomist at Somar, said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  “The frost threat did materialize, however, it did not
really produce any meaningful damage,” Sterling Smith, a
futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a
report e-mailed yesterday. “Coffee will likely retreat back to
the lows, but we are not looking for selling to be as intensive
by the funds.”  Arabica coffee for delivery in September gained as much as
0.7 percent to $1.2215 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. and was up
0.1 percent at $1.2135 a pound by 6:35 a.m. in New York. Prices
fell 3.8 percent yesterday. Robusta coffee for September
delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,887 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe
in  London .  Parana is set to produce 1.7 million bags of coffee this
year, while total output in Brazil was estimated at 48.6 million
bags, according to Conab, the government’s crop-forecasting
agency. A bag weighs 132 pounds.  Arabica coffee fell 16 percent this year as supplies
outpace demand. Prices will be at about $1.20 a pound for the
next quarter, with upside limited, Mathijs Deguelle, an analyst
at  ABN Amro  Bank said in a report e-mailed today.  “In the short- to mid-term, however, ABN Amro expects
prices to remain below production costs, at least until the
current enormous surplus has been absorbed,” he said.  Raw sugar for delivery in October gained 1.1 percent to
16.32 cents a pound on ICE. White sugar for October delivery was
up 0.4 percent to $476.70 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa for September delivery was little changed at $2,362 a
ton in New York. Cocoa for September delivery was 0.7 percent
higher at 1,606 pounds ($2,454) a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
