PT Kalbe Farma (KLBF) ,  Indonesia ’s largest
drugmaker, fell to a two-week low in Jakarta equity trading
after the company’s chief financial officer said the weakening
rupiah will drive up costs.  The  shares  dropped 1.4 percent to close at 1,400 rupiah,
the lowest level since July 10. The benchmark  Jakarta Composite
Index (JCI)  declined 0.9 percent. The currency impact will be felt in
three-to-four months, Kalbe’s CFO Vidjongtius said in a mobile-phone text message today.  The rupiah’s decline to a four-year low versus the dollar
this week will erode profit margins of companies such as Kalbe
which sources 90 percent of its raw materials overseas,
Christandi Rheza Mihardja, analyst at PT Sinarmas Sekuritas,
said by phone today.  “In the short-term, the rupiah exchange rate is the main
concern for the company,” Mihardja said.  Kalbe Farma  shares  have jumped 32 percent this year,
outpacing the 8.3 percent rise in the Jakarta Composite. A
government plan to introduce a nationwide health-care insurance
program has boosted sentiment in the pharmaceutical industry,
Adrian Joezer, an analyst at PT Mandiri Sekuritas said in a note
on July 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
