Copper futures rebounded in New York
after a report showed orders for automobiles, machinery and
other durable goods jumped more than analyst forecasts in the
U.S., the second-biggest consumer of the metal.  Bookings for products meant to last at least three years
rose 4.2 percent, three times the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg, government data showed today. The  dollar 
dropped against a basket of 10 currencies, boosting the appeal
of copper as an alternative asset. Earlier, the metal dropped as
much as 0.9 percent amid concerns that demand will ebb in  China ,
the top buyer.  “We have a weakened dollar and a good durables report, and
that’s bullish,” Michael Smith, the president of T&K Futures &
Options in Port St. Lucie,  Florida , said in a telephone
interview. “Copper reflects the economic outlook, so the market
is paying attention to news like this.”  Copper futures for September delivery advanced 0.2 percent
to settle at $3.1855 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal has gained in five of the past six sessions.  A separate report today showed U.S.  consumer confidence 
matched a five-year high. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
improved to minus 27.3 in the week ended July 21, matching the
highest since January 2008.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months declined 0.6 percent to $7,015 a metric ton ($3.18 a
pound).  Tin fell 0.7 percent to $19,375 a ton on the LME.
 Indonesia ’s PT Timah, the third-biggest producer, said that
sales may drop 18 percent in 2013 as global demand ebbs.  This year, tin has slumped 17 percent, the most among LME
metals. Aluminum, nickel and zinc fell today, while lead rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
