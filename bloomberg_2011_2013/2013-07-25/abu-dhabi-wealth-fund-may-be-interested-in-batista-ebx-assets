Mubadala Development Co., the Abu
Dhabi sovereign wealth fund that restructured a $2 billion
investment in  Eike Batista ’s EBX Group Co., may be interested in
more of the billionaire’s businesses after their value slumped.  Many of the commodities holding company’s assets have
significant value to a number of parties including Mubadala,
according to an e-mailed response to questions today from a fund
spokesman, who asked not to be identified citing company policy.  EBX agreed to redeem a “significant portion” of
Mubadala’s initial investment this month and give “enhanced
protection” to remaining funds. Batista’s six publicly traded
companies have lost about $10 billion in market value this year
as oil company  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes (OGXP3)  SA missed output
targets and abandoned fields previously declared commercial.  Mubadala also said that it remains in talks with EBX as it
continues to restructure its business. The government-owned fund
agreed to take a 5.63 percent stake in EBX at the peak of the
Brazilian group’s market value in March last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
