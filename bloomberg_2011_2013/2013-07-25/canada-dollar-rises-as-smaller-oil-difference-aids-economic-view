The Canadian dollar reached its
highest level in a month as the discount on Canadian heavy oil
compared with the U.S. benchmark  narrowed  from its widest in
more than two months, boosting growth prospects.  Crude oil, the nation’s largest export, was little changed,
remaining above $100 a barrel for a 16th straight day in New
York. Average weekly earnings picked up speed in May with a 2.5
percent increase compared with a 2.2 percent increase the month
before, Statistics Canada reported.  “If you look at the energy sector, which is a more
important one for Canada, prices there are holding firm, if not
doing relatively well,” said David Watt, chief economist in
Toronto at the Canadian unit of HSBC Holdings Plc. “The market
got a bit ahead of itself in pricing in Canadian dollar
weakness.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known, rose 0.4
percent to C$1.0280 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto.
Earlier it touched C$1.0255 per U.S. dollar, the highest since
June 19. One loonie buys 97.28 U.S. cents.  The Canadian dollar breached its 100-day moving average of
C$1.0269 before weakening.  Canada ’s benchmark 10-year government  bond  rose, with
yields falling two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
2.46 percent. The 1.5 percent security maturing in June 2023
added 15 cents to C$91.66.  Oil Trade  The Canadian dollar has rallied since touching C$1.0609 on
July 5, the weakest level in almost two years. Much of gain has
been due to increased oil prices linked to temporary factors
such as political turmoil in the Middle East and seasonal
increases in U.S. oil demand, according to a note from Citigroup
Inc. analysts led by Josh O’Byrne.  With the Bank of Canada unlikely to raise rates until early
2015, the loonie could drop against the U.S. dollar with the
ending of the temporary factors elevating oil prices, the note
said.  Futures on crude oil rose 0.2 percent to C$105.57 per
barrel, after dropping the most in a month yesterday. Oil has
stayed above $100 per barrel since July 3. The discount for
Canadian heavy oil compared with U.S. benchmarks was $20.50,
down from the $22 level on July 23, which was the most since May
10.  Gold futures added 0.9 percent to $1,333.83 an ounce in New
York, almost a one-month high.  Commodities Influence  “Since gold’s had a bit of a bounce and crude’s tested up
above 100, the Canadian dollar’s been doing better,” David Bradley, director of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Nova
Scotia’s Scotia Capital Inc., said by phone from Toronto. “I
think the market assumed prematurely things were looking too
bleak and glum.”  The strong crude prices are lowering borrowing costs for
energy companies globally and benefiting heavy-oil producers in
Canada’s oil sands, such as  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  and  Canadian
Natural (CNQ)  Resources Ltd., more than North American peers.  Relative yields for Calgary-based Suncor have narrowed 28
basis points, or 0.28 percentage point, since June 21, and
Canadian Natural spreads have tightened 25 basis points, versus
a 22 basis-point compression on average in the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Energy Index.  The loonie has gained 0.2 percent in the past month against
nine developed nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation Weighted Index. The U.S. dollar has fallen 1.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
