Gasoline on the  spot market  in the
Gulf Coast strengthened relative to futures amid refinery unit
shut-downs and equipment malfunctions in the region.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  had a compressor trip offline
yesterday at the 460,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Garyville,
Louisiana.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s 310,000-barrel-a-day plant in
 Port Arthur ,  Texas , worked to repair a fluid catalytic cracker
that has been shut since July 12.  Area  gasoline supplies  fell by 1.27 million barrels last
week to 76.9 million, U.S. Energy Information Administration
data showed yesterday.  Conventional, 87-octane  gasoline  on the Gulf Coast
strengthened by 1.63 cents to a 13.75-cent-a-gallon discount to
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 12:05
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
narrowest the differential has been since July 11.  Ultra-low-sulfur  diesel  in the  Gulf Coast  strengthened by
0.45 cent to a discount of 3.5 cents a gallon below ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex, the first time the
differential has narrowed since July 16.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped 23 cents to
$15.51 a barrel. The same spread for  Light Louisiana Sweet oil 
gained 63 cents to $10.16 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
