KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm
run by billionaires  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , hired the
former head of  Prudential Plc (PRU) ’s property arm as it steps up
real-estate investment in western Europe.  KKR hired Martin Moore, 56, as a senior adviser, the New
York-based firm said in an e-mailed statement. Moore retired
last month as chairman of Prudential’s M&G Real Estate division,
a role he held for a year after being managing director of the
unit since 1996.  “Martin has built, over many investment cycles, a great
knowledge and understanding of the real estate business,
especially in the U.K.,” Guillaume Cassou, director of real
estate at KKR Europe, said in the statement.  KKR is looking at “a number” of potential property deals,
Cassou said. The buyout firm is raising its debut real estate
fund after completing its first European property purchase last
month, buying 430,000 square feet (40,000 square meters) of U.K.
retail warehouses from Resolution Property Plc for an
undisclosed sum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
