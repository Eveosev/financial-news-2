U.K. stocks  retreated for the third
time this week as mining companies declined and as investors
awaited data on Britain’s economic growth in the second quarter.  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  tumbled 5.2 percent for the worst
performance on the benchmark gauge after Sanford C. Bernstein
Ltd. said its valuation may drop in the second half.  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group each fell at least 1.3 percent
as copper prices fell for the first time in six days.  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/)  climbed 3.5 percent as the commercial-aircraft engine maker said first-half profit jumped 34 percent.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  lost 18.83 points, or 0.3 percent, to
6,601.6 at 8:59 a.m. in  London . The equity benchmark has still
 climbed 9.5 percent  from a low on June 24 as central banks
around the world pledged to continue stimulus measures. The FTSE
All-Share Index also slid 0.3 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index gained 0.3 percent.  The U.K.’s  gross domestic product  rose 0.6 percent in the
three months through June, economists forecast in a Bloomberg
survey before the Office for National Statistics publishes the
data at 9:30 a.m. That would mark the first back-to-back
quarterly growth since September 2011.  Today’s report is a first estimate and is usually based on
about 44 percent of total data. The economy expanded 0.3 percent
in the first quarter.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
today was 32 percent lower than the 30-day average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Capita Plc (CPI) , which supplies services to the British army,
slipped 2.7 percent after reporting a decline in first-half
operating-profit margin.  Unilever lost 1.5 percent after posting quarterly sales
that missed estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
