Ibovespa futures fell as lower
commodity prices dimmed the outlook for Brazilian exporters and
after cosmetics maker  Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3) ’s quarterly sales
missed analysts’ estimates.  Power utility  Energias do Brasil  SA may move as earnings
trailed analysts’ average forecast. Retailer  Lojas Americanas SA (LAME3) 
may be active after announcing a share buyback plan.  Ibovespa  futures  contracts expiring in August dropped 0.9
percent to 47,890 at 9:30 a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The real was little
changed at 2.2512 per dollar. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index
of 24 raw materials retreated 0.6 percent. Commodities producers
account for 38 percent of the Ibovespa’s weighting.  Brazil ’s benchmark equity gauge slumped 21 percent this
year through yesterday. The Ibovespa trades at 12.3 times
analysts’  earnings estimates  for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.4 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21
developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 5.5 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.7 billion
reais this year, according to data  compiled  by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
