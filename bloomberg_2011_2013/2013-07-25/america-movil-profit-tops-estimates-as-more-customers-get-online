America Movil SAB (AMXL) , the Latin
American wireless company controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim ,
jumped the most in more than a year after higher smartphone use
propelled earnings above analysts’ estimates.  The shares rose 4.4 percent to 13.79 pesos, the biggest
gain since May 2012. They have slid 7.4 percent this year,
compared with the 6 percent decline in the benchmark IPC index.  America Movil is offering more discounts on smartphones and
calling plans to keep competitors from switching to Grupo
Iusacell SA in  Mexico ,  Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3)  in Brazil and
 Telefonica SA (TEF)  in both countries. Slim’s company had 262 million
subscribers at the end of the second quarter.  “AMX delivered on a strong quarter in Mexico,  Brazil  and
Colombia against what we believe were market expectations for a
miss,” Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in New
York, said today in a research note, referring to the company by
its ticker symbol. “AMX remains our favorite North American
carrier idea with an excellent risk/reward profile.”  Second-quarter profit fell 2.1 percent to 65 billion pesos
($5.15 billion), leaving out items such as interest and taxes,
topping the 62.6 billion-peso average of 12 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 1.6 percent to 194.8 billion
pesos, Mexico City-based America Movil said yesterday in a
 statement . Analysts had estimated sales of 190.8 billion pesos.  Subscriber Disconnections  While the carrier’s customer total was up 4.1 percent from
a year earlier, it reflected the net loss of 867,000 customers
from the first quarter as America Movil shut off more accounts
than it signed up. The company disconnected millions of clients
after adopting stricter rules on how long a phone line can go
unused and still count as a subscription.  The accounting change wiped out 15 percent, or 1.9 million,
of America Movil’s  customers  in  Peru  alone. The company erased
307,000 customers from its rolls in  Ecuador , 192,000 in the U.S.
and 100,000 in  Chile .  In Mexico, America Movil added 745,000 customers. Growth
slowed in Brazil, with 164,000 subscriber additions.  Wireless data services such as Internet access were up 17
percent in Mexico, America Movil’s largest market. Voice use
expanded there, too, with the average customer talking for 277
minutes a month, up 4.1 percent from a year ago.  That wasn’t enough to keep the average Mexican customer
bill from falling 2.5 percent to 170 pesos. In Brazil, America
Movil’s second-largest market, revenue per customer also fell
even with an increase in voice traffic.  Net income was 14.2 billion pesos, or 19 centavos a share,
up from 13.2 billion pesos, or 17 centavos, a year earlier.  Leaving out interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
the second-quarter profit margin shrank to 33.4 percent from
34.6 percent a year earlier.  Pay-TV  subscriptions  grew 18 percent from a year earlier to
17.8 million, and landline Internet connections climbed 13
percent to 18.2 million.  (America Movil held a conference call today to discuss the
results. For details, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
