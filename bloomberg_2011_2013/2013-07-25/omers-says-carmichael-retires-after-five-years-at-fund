Ted Carmichael has retired from the
Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System after working
there for five years, according to a spokesman for the Canadian
pension fund.  Carmichael left his position as managing director of multi-strategy portfolio at Omers last week, spokesman John Pierce
said in a telephone interview from Toronto today. Andrew Spence
was hired last year as part of a plan to replace Carmichael,
Pierce said.  Carmichael, who also worked in Toronto for JPMorgan Chase &
Co., didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail request for comment
sent to his LinkedIn profile, which now lists him as a founding
partner at Ted Carmichael Global Macro.  Omers is a Toronto-based fund that manages C$60 billion
($58 billion) for employees and retirees of municipalities in
 Canada ’s most populous province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
