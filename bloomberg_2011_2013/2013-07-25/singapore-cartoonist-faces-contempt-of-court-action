A  Singapore  cartoonist faces
possible contempt of court charges after the Attorney-General’s
Chambers of the city state said his comics scandalized the
judiciary.  Singapore started legal action against Leslie Chew Peng Ee,
the author of the comic series  “Demon-cratic Singapore”  on
Facebook, according to an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The four postings, which the attorney general’s office
found offensive, have since been taken down. Demon-cratic
Singapore is “a 100 percent fictional comic series about a
country that does not exist,” according to its Facebook page.  “Our judiciary is not like fragile flowers to be offended
easily by such criticism,” Chew’s lawyer M. Ravi said in a
phone interview. “We have full faith in the impartiality and
independence of our judiciary.”  Contempt of court carries a possible penalty of a jail
sentence, a fine, or both. No maximum penalty has been specified
under Singapore’s constitution. A high court hearing for Chew’s
case is scheduled for Aug. 12.  Singapore blogger Au Waipang apologized in July 2012 and
deleted a post alleging the courts were biased in favor of the
well-connected after he was threatened with prosecution.  British author  Alan Shadrake  was jailed for six weeks and
fined in 2011 for his book “Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore’s
Justice in the Dock.” Three activists were sentenced to between
seven and 15 days in prison for wearing T-shirts with pictures
of a kangaroo dressed as a judge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
