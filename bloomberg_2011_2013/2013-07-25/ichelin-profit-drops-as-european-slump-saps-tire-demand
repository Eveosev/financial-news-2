Michelin & Cie (ML)  and Faurecia SA
reported a drop of more than 10 percent in first-half profit as
automakers pushed prices lower on slumping demand in Europe.  Michelin, Europe’s largest tiremaker, said operating profit
excluding one-time items declined 13 percent to 1.15 billion
euros ($1.52 billion). Faurecia, the region’s biggest maker of
car interiors, posted a 16 percent decrease in operating profit
to 256 million euros.  The two French auto suppliers are cutting expenses in
Europe, where the market is headed for its sixth straight annual
decline, and expanding in Asia and other growth areas. Faurecia
today forecast that car production in its home region will
decline 3 percent to 4 percent this year, spurring automakers to
seek lower prices on the parts they purchase.  “The contraction affects the whole chain,” said Jean-Francois Belorgey, who runs Ernst & Young’s auto sector.
“European suppliers are probably more affected than others
because they have a bigger European industrial base in their
business that supplies more largely the region’s carmakers. This
situation is set to continue at least into 2014.”  Faurecia, based in Nanterre,  plunged  as much as 1.66 euros,
or 8.1 percent, to 18.73 euros and was down 5.6 percent as of
1:02 p.m. in Paris trading. Clermont-Ferrand-based Michelin
 dropped  as much as 4.10 euros, or 5.3 percent, to 72.82 euros
and was down 2.8 percent.  Cutting Spending  The slowdown in Europe has prompted Michelin to look at
ways to trim costs in the region, where about 59 percent of its
107,000 workers are employed. Michelin said on June 10 that it
would end production of heavy-truck tires at a factory in Joue-les-Tours, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) southwest of Paris,
by the end of 2015. About 730 of the plant’s 930 employees will
lose their jobs.  Faurecia (EO)  is also reducing fixed costs and the measures put
in place will yield savings of 50 million euros this year and
100 million euros in 2014, the company said. The moves will lead
to 90 million euros in charges in 2013, including 39 million
euros booked in the first half.  “We don’t expect a rapid recovery in Europe,” Faurecia
Chief Executive Officer Yann Delabriere said. “We have to
adjust fixed costs to the new level.”  The French manufacturer reiterated its 2013 targets which
include positive net cash flow before restructuring charges of
120 million euros for 2013. Faurecia is forecasting full-year
revenue between 17.8 billion euros and 18 billion euros and an
“improvement” in operating income.  Slumping Demand  Michelin also stuck to a target of keeping 2013 operating
profit “stable” and holding global volumes “steady.” The
company expects lower rubber prices to boost earnings in the
second half as markets improve and sales volumes show “modest”
growth. For the year, the company sees lower prices for raw
materials adding 350 million euros to operating profit.  Demand for replacement tires for cars and light vehicles
slumped 4 percent in Europe in the first half because of the
“uncertain” economy, Michelin said. That led to a 5.3 percent
drop in car-tire operating profit to 550 million euros.  The company plans to invest 1.6 billion euros to 2.2
billion euros a year through 2015 to fuel expansion outside its
home region and to reach an operating income of around 2.5
billion euros in the same year.  Faurecia, which last year bought  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s car-interior business in Saline,  Michigan , has a goal of becoming
one of the top five industry suppliers in North America with $7
billion in yearly sales there by 2016. The company plans to
limit future expansion of its production network to Asia, the
CEO said today, adding that the company was closing in on an
agreement with  China ’s  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104)   To contact the reporters on this story:
