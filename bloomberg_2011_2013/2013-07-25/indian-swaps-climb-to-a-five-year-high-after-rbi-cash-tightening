India ’s  interest-rate swaps  climbed
to a five-year high after the central bank tightened cash supply
to arrest a slide in the rupee.  The  Reserve Bank  of India capped the amount lenders can
borrow in daily repurchase auctions at 0.5 percent of deposits,
according to a statement on July 23. It raised the daily balance
requirement for lenders’ cash-reserve ratios to 99 percent from
70 percent from July 27. Three-month interbank rates surged 100
basis points this month to 9.52 percent, according to prices
from the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. The rupee lost
7.8 percent since March 31 in  Asia ’s worst performance.  “While the central bank’s steps are short-term in nature,
I don’t really see the RBI rolling them back on a whim until
there is evidence to show things are changing,” said Killol Pandya, senior  fund manager  at LIC Nomura Mutual Fund Asset
Management Co. in Mumbai. “There’s going to be pain for the
bond markets.”  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 9.56 percent at 10:30 a.m.
in Mumbai, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate, which
surged 207 basis points in July, touched 9.61 percent earlier,
the highest level since August 2008.  This week’s tightening measures were taken after the RBI
raised two of its  interest rates  on July 15, while keeping the
main  repurchase rate  unchanged at 7.25 percent, and moved to
drain money through bond sales. A weaker currency makes imports
costlier and threatens to spur gains in  consumer prices , which
have stayed close to 10 percent for more than a year. The rupee
rose beyond 59 per dollar today for the first time in more than
a month after the central bank’s steps.  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 declined
13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 8.30 percent,
according to prices from the central bank’s trading system. That
pared this month’s increase in the rate to 85 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
