Posco (005490) , Asia’s fourth-biggest
steelmaker by output, reported a 51 percent decline in second-quarter profit, missing estimates, as weak demand cut prices and
the won’s drop led to foreign-exchange losses.  Group  net income , excluding minority interest, was 250.6
billion won ($225 million) in the three months ended June 30,
versus 509.3 billion won a year ago, Pohang, South Korea-based
Posco said yesterday in a regulatory filing. The average of 10
analyst  estimates  was 554.7 billion won, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Slowing growth in  China , the world’s top steel user, and
 Europe ’s economic crisis sapped demand amid a global glut,
squeezing profit at steelmakers. Posco,  South Korea ’s biggest
maker of the alloy, will seek to expand sales of high-end
products including car sheets and ship plates to weather an
industry slowdown and keep its 2013 sales forecast at 64
trillion won.  “The  steel industry  has been in a slump over the past four
years,” said Lee Jin Woo, a  fund manager  at KTB Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $3.5 billion in assets.
“It’s hard to expect a turnaround unless demand improves enough
to absorb an oversupply stemming from China. Posco looks very
cheap in terms of valuations.”  Posco, which has lost 6.3 percent this year before today,
fell 0.8 percent to 324,500 won at 10:28 a.m. in  Seoul , while
the benchmark  Kospi index  added 0.2 percent. The Kospi has
fallen 4.3 percent in 2013. China’s Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. has
slipped 17 percent this year, while  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo
Metal Corp. (5401)  gained 43 percent.  Forex Charge  Posco took a 283 billion won charge related to its foreign-currency denominated debt because of the won’s depreciation.
That compares with a 272 billion won loss a year ago. The South
Korean currency lost 3 percent against the dollar in the
quarter.  Group operating profit fell 31 percent to 902.6 billion
won, compared with the 897 billion won average of 18 analyst
estimates. Sales dropped 5 percent to 15.6 trillion won.
 Operating margin  was 5.8 percent, compared with 4.9 percent in
the first quarter of this year and 7.9 percent a year earlier.  Posco’s average selling price dropped 14 percent to 794,000
won a ton in the second quarter from a year ago, Posco said. The
first-quarter average was 782,000 won.  Input Costs  “Cost increases in the third quarter won’t be that
worrisome as spot prices could decline,” Chief Financial
Officer Park Ki Hong said on an earnings conference call
yesterday. “We expect to maintain first-half profitability in
the second half.”  Spot prices of  iron ore  may drop to $125 a ton in the third
quarter from $126 in the second quarter, while coal prices may
drop to $137 a ton from $143, Posco said yesterday.  Iron ore  input cost fell about 6 percent to $132 a ton in
the second quarter from a year earlier and may rise to $144 in
the third quarter, Hong Jin Joo, an analyst at Shinhan
Investment Corp., wrote in a June 11 report.  Steel  prices  in China may gradually recover after bottoming
in the third quarter, the company said. World steel demand will
probably increase 3 percent this year, helped by “solid”
growth in  emerging markets , it said. That is in line with the
World Steel Association’s estimate of 2.9 percent announced in
April.  New capacity starting later this year and a risk of lower-priced  imports  from Japan and China may increase competition and
weigh on local prices, Park Byung Chil, an analyst at IBK
Securities Co., wrote in a June 26 report.  Crude Output  Crude steel output declined 6 percent to 8.85 million tons
in the second quarter from a year earlier, while sales fell 3
percent to 8.41 million tons, Posco said yesterday.  The South Korean mill may reduce group-based capital
expenditure for next year by as much as 2 trillion won from an
estimated range of 7 trillion won to 8 trillion won for 2013 as
its major expansions in the country will be completed this year,
Park said.  Posco was the fourth-biggest in  Asia  by 2012 output,
according to latest  rankings  by the World Steel Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
