Hong Kong ’s fund management business
grew 39 percent to a record HK$12.6 trillion ($1.6 trillion) in
2012 as  Asia ’s economic outlook outshone other regions and
offshore use of the Chinese yuan increased.  Overseas investors accounted for about HK$8 trillion, or 65
percent of assets under management, excluding real estate
investment trusts, according to the results of an annual fund
management survey, the Securities and Futures Commission said on
its  website .  “Such significant growth reflected more active engagement
in Hong Kong’s fund management business by the Mainland-related
licensed firms through the launch of a range of  renminbi 
investment products and provision of more advisory services,”
the SFC said in the survey results. That trend “is supported by
the continued growth of the Mainland economy and the rise in
global demand for Mainland-related investments and services.”  Asia may see economic growth of 6.4 percent in 2013
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, the highest of any
region. Hong Kong, the first hub for offshore trading in the
 yuan , is facing challenges from financial centers including
Singapore and London as  China  pushes for greater use of its
currency outside the mainland.  The number of licensed firms participating in the  survey 
increased 19 percent to 485, accounting for some of the growth,
according to the SFC. The number of licensed corporations and
individuals grew by 5.9 percent and 8 percent respectively to
892 and 6,677. The fund management business fell 10 percent to
HK$9 trillion in 2011.  Non-REIT fund management business attributable to Mainland
China-related firms grew 56 percent to HK$415 billion, according
to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
