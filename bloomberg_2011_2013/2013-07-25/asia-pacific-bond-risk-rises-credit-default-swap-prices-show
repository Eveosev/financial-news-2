The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  jumped 7 basis points to 141 basis
points as of 8:46 a.m. in  Singapore ,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The gauge is set for its third straight day of
increases, the longest stretch in more than a month, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 3 basis points to
118 basis points as of 10:47 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The benchmark has traded
between 113 and 139.8 this month, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1.5 basis points to 95.5
basis points as of 9:19 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The measure is heading for its highest close since
July 11, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
