(Corrects to remove reference to Lloyd’s in first
paragraph in story published July 25.)  Lancashire Holdings Ltd. (LRE) , an insurer
of the Costa Concordia, rallied the most in five weeks yesterday
after it reported better-than-expected profit for the second
quarter.  The  stock  climbed 4 percent to 814.5 pence in  London 
trading, the biggest intraday gain since June 14. Lancashire
said pretax profit fell 3.8 percent to $58.3 million from a year
earlier, in a statement today. That beat the average analyst
estimate of $39.1 million provided by the company. Net
investment income dropped 23 percent to $6.5 million.  “These are good results, despite the hit to profit from
investment losses,” Joanna Parsons, an analyst at Westhouse
Securities Ltd. in London wrote in a note to clients. “The
statement is sounding a positive tone and combined with the good
results we would expect the shares to go better.”  The insurer said its loss on the  Carnival Corp. (CCL) ’s Costa
Concordia, which was shipwrecked on the Italian island of Giglio
in January 2012, increased by $37.7 million in the period. Even
so, its combined ratio, or claims and expenses as a percentage
of premiums, was 66.9 percent in the second quarter, surpassing
the average analyst estimate provided by the company of 70.8
percent.  Numis Corp. today increased its full-year pretax profit
estimate for the insurer by $31 million to $232 million and
reiterated its add rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
