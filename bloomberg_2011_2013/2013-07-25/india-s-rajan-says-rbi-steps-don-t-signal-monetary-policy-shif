India’s steps this month to
stabilize its currency should not be seen as indicating a
forthcoming major shift in the central bank’s monetary policy
stance, the Finance Ministry’s chief economic adviser said.  “These measures should be seen not as a precursor to a
substantial change in monetary stance, which, thus far, has been
on the easing side,”  Raghuram Rajan , the top adviser in the
finance ministry, said in an interview to Bloomberg India TV
today. The steps taken so far should be sufficient, he said.  The  Reserve Bank  of India raised two  interest rates  and
drained liquidity in the past two weeks to steady the rupee,
joining nations including Brazil and Indonesia in tightening
policy to check currency volatility. The steps were in contrast
to the lowering of the benchmark  repurchase  rate three times
this year, as  growth  weakened to the slowest pace in a decade.  “By stabilizing the rupee, we will also enhance the
possibility of stronger growth,” said Rajan. “Because the
inflationary consequence will be contained and, hopefully over
time, that will give RBI room to be more accommodative.”  The central bank’s next policy review is due July 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
