World energy consumption will rise
56 percent in the next three decades, driven by growth in
developing countries such as  China  and  India , the Energy
Information Administration said.  Demand will increase to 820 quadrillion British thermal
units in 2040 from 524 quadrillion in 2010, the EIA said in the
International Energy Outlook 2013, with the two Asian countries
accounting for half the gain. One quadrillion Btu is equal to
172 million barrels of crude oil. China, which used 3.4 percent
more energy than the U.S. in 2010, is expected to double U.S.
demand by 2040.  “Rising prosperity in China and India is a major factor in
the outlook for global energy demand,” EIA Administrator Adam Sieminski said in a news release. “This will have a profound
effect on the development of world energy markets.”  Demand in countries outside the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development will increase by 90 percent through
2040. Use by OECD members, including the U.S. and  Japan , will
grow 17 percent.  Use of petroleum and other liquid fuels will grow to 115
million barrels a day in 2040 from 87 million in 2010. Liquid
fuels will account for 28 percent of demand in 2040, down from
34 percent in 2010.  China Consumption  U.S. energy  consumption  will reach 107 quadrillion Btu by
2040, up from 98 quadrillion in 2010. China will use 220
quadrillion Btu, up from 101 quadrillion.  U.S. liquids consumption will be 19 million barrels a day
in 2040, unchanged from 2010. China will use 20 million barrels
a day, more than doubling from 9 million in 2010.  Brent crude will average $106 a barrel in 2020 and $163 in
2040, valued in 2011 dollars. Brent, a gauge for more than half
the world’s oil, averaged $107.83 this year through yesterday.  Brent for September settlement rose 46 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $107.65 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. West  Texas  Intermediate, the
U.S. benchmark, rose 10 cents to $105.49 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  U.S. oil  production  climbed to 7.56 million barrels a day
in the week ended July 19, the most since December 1990, the EIA
said yesterday in a weekly report.  Shale Oil  A combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies in shale
formations in North Dakota, Texas and other states. Rising
output helped the U.S. meet 89 percent of its energy needs in
March, the highest rate since April 1986, EIA data show.  “Advances in technology make liquids production in
previously inaccessible regions increasingly feasible,” the EIA
said. “An important example of the potential impact of
technological advances is the rapid growth of U.S. shale oil
production in recent years.”  World shale oil recoverable resources are 345 billion
barrels, according to the EIA.  The report also made these predictions:  -- Fossil fuels, including oil, natural gas and coal, will
supply almost 80 percent of world energy through 2040.  -- Natural gas use will grow 64 percent, faster than any
other fossil fuel. Consumption will be 185 trillion cubic feet
in 2040, up from 113 trillion in 2010.  -- Renewable and nuclear, the fastest-growing sources, will
increase by 2.5 percent a year.  -- Coal consumption will rise 1.3 percent a year to 220
quadrillion Btu in 2040 from 147 quadrillion.  -- Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions are projected to
increase 46 percent to 45 billion metric tons by 2040.  -- Net electricity generation will almost double, rising to
39 trillion kilowatt-hours from 20.2 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
