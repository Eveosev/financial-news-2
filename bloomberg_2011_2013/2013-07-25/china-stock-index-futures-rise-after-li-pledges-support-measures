China’s stocks  fell as smaller
companies tumbled from the highest valuations in more than two
years and BOE Technology Group Co. sank on plans to sell shares.  BOE Technology, a maker of liquid crystal displays whose
market value is 28.6 billion  yuan  ($4.7 billion), plunged 9.4
percent after announcing plans to raise up to 46 billion yuan in
a private placement. Leshi Internet Information & Technology Co.
retreated 9.3 percent, sending the ChiNext index of small
companies to its biggest loss in a month.  CSR Corp. (601766)  and China
Railway Construction Corp. rose at least 2.9 percent after the
government announced plans to accelerate railway construction.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid for a second day, losing
0.6 percent to 2,021.17 at the close. The ChiNext fell 2.8
percent. A gauge tracking technology shares in the CSI 300 Index
sank 3.5 percent, paring its advance this year to 34 percent.
BOE is taking advantage of recent gains to raise funds, said Xu Shengjun, analyst at Jianghai Securities Co.  “The amount of funds being raised by BOE is a bit
ridiculous when its actual market cap is not even 30 billion
yuan,” Xu said by phone from  Shanghai . “Small-cap stocks are
falling because they are getting too expensive.”  The CSI 300 fell 0.5 percent to 2,237.68. The Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong 
lost 0.3 percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index dropped
0.8 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Technology Slump  The  gauge  of technology companies in the CSI 300 fell the
most among the 10 industry groups and posted its biggest loss
since July 8. BOE Technology dropped 0.20 yuan to 2.19 yuan with
trading volumes twice as high as the three-month average.  BOE Technology’s board approved a plan to sell up to 22.4
billion shares in a private placement, according to a statement
to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Software maker Neusoft Corp.
retreated for the first time in six days, losing 4.3 percent to
10.18 yuan. The company’s 14-day relative strength index was at
75.15 yesterday. Some analysts consider levels above 70 as a
sign the stock is overbought.  Leshi Internet led declines for ChiNext stocks, dropping
9.3 percent to 30.42 yuan. The ChiNext’s valuation reached the
highest level since January 2011 yesterday. It now trades at
36.1 times 12-month projected earnings, compared with 8.8 for
the CSI 300 Index and 8.2 for the Shanghai Composite.  CSR, the biggest Chinese trainmaker, surged 3.1 percent to
4.03 yuan. China Railway jumped 2.9 percent to 5.03 yuan.  Premier  Li Keqiang  said railway construction will focus on
central and western parts of the country. The government plans
to grant ownership and operating rights on some city and
regional railways to local government and private investors, as
well as set up a railway development fund.  The government also said it would exempt companies with
monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan from value-added and
business taxes starting Aug. 1, which will benefit more than 6
million small businesses.  Trading volumes on the Shanghai Composite were 3 percent
higher than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The index has fallen 11 percent this year, compared
with a 13 percent gain for the MSCI All-Country World Index.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact the reporter on this story:
