Iran  is inviting foreign heads of
state to attend the swearing-in ceremony for new President
Hassan Rohani next month, in a break with the Islamic Republic’s
traditions.  “For the first time, Iran decided to invite foreign
dignitaries,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Araghchi
said. All nations except the U.S. and  Israel  are invited, he
told reporters in Tehran on July 23. Iran hasn’t had diplomatic
ties with the U.S. for more than three decades, and doesn’t
recognize Israel. Previous events were attended by ambassadors,
according to state-run  Press TV .  The Aug. 4 ceremony will take place a day after Rohani’s
endorsement by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
highest authority in the country. Rohani, who campaigned for
more moderation in Iran’s domestic and foreign policies, was
elected June 14 to succeed President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .  Araghchi did not say why this inauguration will be
different. The move may serve to illustrate Rohani’s pledge to
better engage with the world after eight years under Ahmadinejad
in which the Islamic republic became increasingly isolated
politically and economically.  Afghan President  Hamid Karzai , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Lebanese President Michel Suleiman are planning to
attend the event, Press TV reported. Syria’s Prime Minister Wael al-Halaqi, Iraqi Vice-President Khudair al-Khuzaie, and top
officials from  Kuwait , Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar
will also come, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
