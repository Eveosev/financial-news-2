SAC Capital Advisors LP, the
$14 billion hedge fund founded by  Steven A. Cohen , was indicted
by a federal grand jury as part of the governmentâ€™s six-year
crackdown on  insider trading  on  Wall Street .  The charges against the Stamford, Connecticut-based hedge
fund are the most significant to be brought by the U.S. since
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. director  Rajat Gupta  was accused
of insider trading in October 2011. Gupta, convicted by a
federal jury in New York last year, was sentenced to two years
in prison. He remains free on appeal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
