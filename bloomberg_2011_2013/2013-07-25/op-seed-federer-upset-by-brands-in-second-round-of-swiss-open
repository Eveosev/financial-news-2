Roger Federer  was upset by Daniel
Brands in the second round of the Swiss Open, his second
consecutive loss to a player at least 50 places below him in the
world rankings.  Brands, a 26-year-old German ranked 55th by the ATP World
Tour, won 6-3, 6-4 in 66 minutes in Gstaad. Fifth-ranked Federer
was playing his homeland tournament for the first time since
winning the title in 2004. He had a bye in the first round.  Federer, 31, defeated Brands in Hamburg,  Germany , last week
before being upset by No. 114-ranked Federico Delbonis of
Argentina in the semifinals.  The Swiss picked up his lone tournament victory of the
season last month in Halle, Germany. The 17-time Grand Slam
champion was then upset by Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine in the
second round at Wimbledon, his earliest defeat in 11 years for
the seven-time winner at the grass-court major.  To contact the reporter on this story:
