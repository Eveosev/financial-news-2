Ringgit forwards fell by the most in
five weeks and bonds dropped after a U.S. home sales report
bolstered speculation the  Federal Reserve  will pare stimulus,
prompting downgrades to Malaysia’s growth forecasts.  The Malaysian Institute of  Economic Research  cut its 2013
estimate to 4.8 percent from 5.6 percent today, according to a
presentation given to reporters in Kuala Lumpur, joining
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in lowering forecasts.
Home purchases in the U.S. climbed 8.3 percent to an annualized
rate of 497,000 in June, the highest level since May 2008,
official data showed yesterday, spurring the biggest gain in the
Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index in almost three weeks.  “There was a bit of gain overnight on the dollar side,”
said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at
Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore, forecasting the ringgit will
trade between 3.17 and 3.22 per dollar in the  spot market  over
the next week. “U.S. data helped the dollar.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 1.1 percent,
the largest decline since June 20, to 3.2613 per dollar as of
10:44 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts traded 1.9 percent weaker than the spot
rate, which fell 0.3 percent to 3.2001.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 13 basis points,
or 0.13 percentage point, to 6.83 percent.  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group lowered its
forecast for Malaysia’s 2013 economic growth to 4.35 percent
from 5.2 percent, according to a July 23 research note.  The yield on the 3.172 percent sovereign notes due July
2016 climbed one basis point to 3.41 percent, adding to
yesterday’s five basis-point advance, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
