The yen climbed against all of its
16 most-traded peers as investors sought safety amid a drop in
Asian stocks after disappointing Japanese corporate earnings.  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index  fell for a third week amid bets
the  Federal Reserve  won’t signal a change next week in monetary
stimulus. Japanese government 10-year bonds, which are sensitive
to inflation, rose even as data showed consumer prices gained
the most since 2008. The Japan-U.S. yield gap was little
changed.  South Africa ’s rand slid as  China  cut production
capacity, damping trade prospects.  “That the yen is better across the board reflects the
weakness in the Japanese stocks,”  Vassili Serebriakov , a
foreign-exchange strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  New York , said
in a telephone interview. “There’s been an element of risk-off
in terms of equities sliding.”  The yen climbed 1.1 percent to 98.21 per dollar at 5 p.m.
New York time and touched 97.96, the strongest level since June
27. It rallied 2.5 percent this week.  Japan ’s currency
appreciated 1.1 percent to 130.42 per euro, extending this
week’s advance to 1.4 percent. The dollar was little changed at
$1.3279 per euro, losing 1 percent on the week.  Futures traders increased for a fourth straight week bets
that the yen will decline against the dollar, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The
difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and other
large speculators on a drop in the yen compared with those on a
gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 87,496 on July 23, the
biggest gap since May 31. That compares with net shorts of
85,762 a week earlier.  Dollar Bets  Bets that the greenback will gain versus eight peers
including the euro, yen and pound fell to $28 billion as of July
23, a $1.3 billion decline to the lowest since July 9, according
to CFTC data compiled by Societe Generale SA.  A gauge of price fluctuations among Group-of-Seven
currencies fell for a fifth week, the longest stretch in a year.
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s G-7 Volatility Index declined to 9.45
percent after reaching 9.11 percent on July 24, the lowest
intraday level since May 9.  The yen strengthened 1 percent in the past three months
among 10-developed nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation Weighted Indexes, trimming its 2013 decline to 9.4
percent. The dollar advanced 1.2 percent since April, and the
euro rose 3.4 percent.  Rand, Real  The South African rand slid versus most major peers as
China ordered more than 1,400 companies to cut excess production
capacity, dimming the outlook for the country’s exporters. The
currency dropped 0.5 percent to 9.7704 to the greenback.  Brazil ’s real also weakened on the Chinese announcement
amid bets commodities exports will be hurt. The currency
depreciated 0.6 percent to 2.2562 reais per dollar.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $23 billion, compared with $29 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $7.5 billion, the
largest share of trades at 33 percent. Options on the euro-dollar rate totaled $2.2 billion, or 9.8 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 13 percent above the average
for the past five Fridays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis. Euro-dollar options trading was
39 percent less than average.  Dollar Gauge  The Bloomberg Dollar Index fell before the  Federal Open
Market Committee  holds its next  meeting  July 30-31. The currency
 index , which tracks the dollar against 10 major peers, was at
1,022.85, down 1 percent on the week and 0.1 percent today.  Fed policy makers may debate so-called forward guidance,
which is their description of policy intentions in coming years,
according to a Wall Street Journal article yesterday.  “We have the obvious catalyst in terms of the Wall Street
Journal article,” BNP Paribas’ Serebriakov said. “You’ve seen
basically the yield support for the dollar continuing to erode,
and that’s still the underlying story here.”  U.S. 10-year note yields fell for second day, losing one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.56 percent.  The Fed will maintain its monthly bond-buying at $85
billion, according to 54 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
from July 18-22. Half of those polled said Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will trim purchases in September to $65 billion. The
purchases tend to devalue the greenback.  Japanese Stocks  Japanese stocks fell as Chipmaker Advantest Corp. plunged
9.7 percent after posting a 3.6 billion yen ($36 million) loss.
JFE Holdings Inc., Japan’s No. 2 steelmaker, slid 8.3 percent
after forecasting current profit that missed analyst estimates.
The Topix stock index sank 2.9 percent, the most since June 13.  The MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index decreased 0.5 percent, and
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks was little changed.  Japan’s 10-year government-bond yields declined two basis
points to 0.79 percent. They were 178 basis points less than
comparable U.S.  Treasuries (USGG10YR) , little changed from yesterday. The
gap was 167 basis points at the end of last week.  Consumer prices in Japan excluding fresh food climbed 0.4
percent in June from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said
in  Tokyo . The median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for an increase of 0.3 percent.  “We had the inflation data in Japan which was a bit higher
than expected, and that’s reducing expectations of further
monetary easing and giving a lift to the yen,” said  Niels Christensen , chief currency strategist at Nordea Bank AB in
Copenhagen.  The Japanese currency has weakened 7.5 percent over the
past six months against the dollar as officials have pushed to
end deflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
