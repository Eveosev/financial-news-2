Citigroup Inc. (C) , the U.S. lender with
a presence in 16 African countries, sees increased sales from
the continent this year as customers expand on the continent.  “We expect Africa revenues to grow and to grow from our
client business,” Donna Oosthuyse, Citigroup’s South Africa
head, said today in Johannesburg. “We expect growth from our
flow revenue. We’ve had a couple of good years in trading
because of low interest rates and the rebound in equities.”  Banks including  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ,  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and
 FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  are expanding in Africa where countries including
Nigeria and Ghana are growing faster than developed nations. As
many as 70 percent of the U.S. companies already operating in
South Africa have a presence in another 10 African countries on
average, according to Oosthuyse. Citigroup, which doesn’t offer
consumer banking in Africa, is involved in project financing and
business and investment banking on the continent.  While Citigroup’s Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat 
said in March the bank may exit or scale back businesses in 21
nations, it hasn’t exited any markets in Africa, Oosthuyse said.  The bank has been hiring staff, in particular for its
custody and clearing operations, and plans to transform its
Ghanaian unit from a representative office to a currency trading
operation, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
