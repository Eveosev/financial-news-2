Zimbabwe  can’t afford to hold
elections this year, the state-controlled  Sunday Mail  reported,
citing Simpson Mutambanengwe, a retired judge and chairman of
the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission.  The ZEC was allocated $8.5 million this year, which is
insufficient to hold an election or a referendum on changes to
Zimbabwe’s constitution, the Harare-based newspaper cited
Mutambanengwe as saying.  Under a power-sharing agreement brokered by the Southern
African Development Community, Zimbabweans must vote on whether
to accept a new constitution before elections can be held.  In the meantime, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai’s
Movement for Democratic Change, which won a 2008 parliamentary
election, must share power with President  Robert Mugabe ’s
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
