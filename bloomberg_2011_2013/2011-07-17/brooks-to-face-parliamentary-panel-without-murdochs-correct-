(Corrects spelling of Rebekah Brooks in first paragraph.)  John Whittingdale, head of the U.K.
cross-party parliamentary committee that will question  Rupert Murdoch ,  James Murdoch  and Rebekah Brooks this week in
connection with phone-hacking allegations, said the panel may
interview Brooks separately.  “Now that Brooks is no longer an employee of  News Corp. (NWSA)  we
will probably want to talk to her separately,” he said on the
BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
