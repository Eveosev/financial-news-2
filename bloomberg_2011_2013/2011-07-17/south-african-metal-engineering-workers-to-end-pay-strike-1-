About 320,000 workers in  South
Africa ’s metals and engineering industries will return to work
in the next 48 hours after securing a wage agreement with their
employers.  The  National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa  agreed
to a wage increase of 10 percent, ending a strike that began on
July 4, said Frederick Gina, the union’s president, in a phone
interview today.  Under the terms of the settlement, companies will pay
workers an extra 8 percent a year over the next two years and
will phase out the use of labor brokers, Numsa said in an e-
mailed statement.  The union had demanded an increase of 13 percent, while the
Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of South Africa,
which represents employers, had offered 7 percent.  South Africa has suffered repeated strikes over the past
two weeks as mine and factory workers pushed for wages to climb
at more than double the rate of inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
