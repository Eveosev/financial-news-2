Mayor of London  Boris Johnson 
accepted Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson’s
resignation “with great sadness” and “reluctance,” he told
Sky News in an interview.  Stephenson resigned so as not to be a “distraction” in
the run-up to the Olympic Games and there’s “no question”
about Stephenson’s own “integrity,” Johnson said in the
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
