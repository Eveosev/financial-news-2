The euro fell against the dollar and
the yen, extending last week’s declines after government bond
yields surged in  Italy , drawing the region’s largest borrower
further into the sovereign-debt crisis.  The Swiss franc climbed versus the dollar and the euro as
investors sought safety.  The 17-nation euro fell to $1.4115 as of 6:35 a.m. in
Sydney, from $1.4157 on July 15 in  New York . It slid to 111.62
yen from 112.02 yen and tumbled 1.1 percent to 1.1411 franc.  The dollar dropped 0.8 percent to 80.85 Swiss centimes and
traded at 79.09 yen from 79.13 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
