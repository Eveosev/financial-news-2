New Zealand â€™s governing  National
Party  extended its lead over its main opposition as support for
the  Labour Party  tumbled in a poll conducted July 9-13,
 Television New Zealand   said .  Support for National rose 1 percentage point to 53 percent
in the Colmar Brunton poll as Labour popularity fell to 27
percent from 34 percent in the previous poll in May, the
broadcaster said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Green Party
support rose to 10 percent.  The poll was taken before Labour announced plans to
introduce a capital gains tax if it wins the November general
election, although reports signaling the planned tax had been
circulating, TVNZ said. Labour support was the lowest since at
least early 2002, it said.  Prime Minister John Key had 54 percent support as preferred
prime minister and Labour leader Phil Goff had 9 percent.  Optimism about the economy rose 4 points to 52 percent, and
pessimism dropped 5 points to 28 percent, according to the poll,
which surveyed 1,008 eligible voters and had a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
