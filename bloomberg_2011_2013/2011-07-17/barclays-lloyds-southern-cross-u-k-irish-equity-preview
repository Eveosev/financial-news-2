U.K. stocks declined for a third day
amid speculation that European banks will need to raise more
capital as stress tests failed to allay investor concern that
lenders have insufficient loss-absorbing funds.  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  sank at least 6 percent, leading bank shares
lower, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. said European lenders may have to
raise about 80 billion euros ($112 billion) of additional
capital.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  fell 90.85, or 1.6 percent, to
5,752.81 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , extending last week’s
2.5 percent slide. The benchmark measure has slipped 5.6 percent
since its peak this year on Feb. 8 as concern grew that the
European debt crisis will derail the economic recovery. The  FTSE
All-Share Index (ASX)  declined 1.3 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index retreated 0.9 percent.  “Sadly, we think the European banking stress test is
unlikely to provide much in terms of assurance to the markets,”
Dirk Hoffmann-Becking, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.,
wrote in a report to clients today. “The concerns about
contagion of the sovereign-debt crisis into core  Europe  have
taken center stage and only a substantial change in the
governments’ approach could change the current trend around.”  The eight that failed the stress tests have a combined
capital shortfall of 2.5 billion euros, the European Banking
Authority said on July 15, less than analysts and investors had
predicted. As many as 20 banks need to bolster capital, JPMorgan
analyst  Kian Abouhossein  wrote in a report on July 16.  Barclays, RBS, Lloyds  Barclays tumbled 7 percent to 207.7 pence. RBS slumped 6
percent to 33 pence. Lloyds sank 7.5 percent to 41.3 pence.  Lavendon Group Plc (LVD)  surged 4.4 percent to 108 pence, its
largest climb in three weeks. The company performed better in
the first half than it had forecast, with revenue increasing 8
percent from a year earlier and operating margins widening, the
company said.  Rank Group Plc (RNK)  rose 1.8 percent to 153.7 pence as Guoco
Group Ltd. said its shareholding will stay at 74.5 percent and
Rank said it would remain listed following Guoco’s 150 pence per
share offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
