Italy needs a new government of
technocrats to weather the financial-market storm because Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Cabinet has lost the confidence of
investors, economist  Nouriel Roubini  told la Repubblica.  Berlusconi’s conflict between his business and political
interests and a judicial probe into a former aide of Finance
Minister Giulio Tremonti make the “government absolutely not up
to the severity of the task,” Roubini told the Rome-based  daily 
in an interview published today. Italy needs a temporary Cabinet
of technocrats to enact structural economic changes, the
economist said.  The nation’s new austerity plan also mainly targets lower
and middle incomes, which will damp demand and weigh on growth,
said the co-founder of Roubini Global Economics LLC, according
to Repubblica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
