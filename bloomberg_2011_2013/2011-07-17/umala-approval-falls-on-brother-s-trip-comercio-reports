Peru’s President-elect Ollanta Humala’s voter approval rating fell to 41 percent from 70
percent in June, after his brother Alexis’ visit to  Russia ,  El
Comercio  newspaper reported, citing a poll by Ipsos Apoyo.  Some 77 percent of those surveyed agreed that Alexis Humala
sought to use his ties to the president-elect for personal
benefit in seeking investments with Russian companies including
in energy, fishing and tourism.  Humala, an ex-army officer who edged out Congresswoman
Keiko Fujimori for the presidency on June 5, held a 70 percent
approval rating in a poll released June 19 by Ipsos Apoyo, the
daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
