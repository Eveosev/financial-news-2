National regulators and lenders
stopped the European Banking Authority from setting tougher
stress tests by making it difficult to obtain accurate data, the
EBA told analysts, according to the  Sunday Telegraph .  EBA Chairman Andrea Enria outlined the difficulties and the
regulator said it would have liked to make the tests on 91 of
the regionâ€™s banks more strenuous, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
