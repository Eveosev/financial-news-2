German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
urged private investors to help rescue  Greece  and said the euro
region is “trying everything we can” to avoid restructuring
the country’s debt.  “What’s important is that the debt sustainability of
Greece is ensured,” Merkel said in an interview with German
public  broadcaster  ARD in Berlin today. “The more we get
private creditors involved voluntarily now, the less likely we
will have to take further steps.”  Leaders of euro-area countries are slated to meet June 21
in Brussels to discuss a second aid package for Greece after
last year’s 110 billion-euro ($156 billion) bailout failed to
stop the spread of the debt crisis. European officials and
private lenders met last week in  Rome  to discuss how to involve
private investors in a plan for Greece.  “We are trying everything we can to avoid something even
tougher,” Merkel said today. “The inclusion of private
creditors does show that we have a special problem in Greece
because of the very, very high level of debt.”  Merkel will travel to a euro area summit in Brussels “if
there is a result,” she said. Merkel said she is hopeful the
talks will make progress because private investors “have an
interest that the euro as a whole remains stable and an interest
in Greece getting back on its feet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
