European Union leaders will consider
expanding the continent’s rescue fund to make a significant
purchase of Greek debt on the secondary market,  El Pais 
reported, citing a senior European official it didn’t identify.  The fund would either purchase Greek bonds directly in the
market or via loans to the Greek Treasury, the newspaper said.  Leaders will also consider reducing the interest rate on
bailout loans already granted to  Greece , and possibly Ireland
and  Portugal , as well as extending their maturities to ease the
debt burden, the newspaper reported.  Officials need to find a way of reducing the Greek debt
burden to a “sustainable” level, the newspaper cited the
unidentified official as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
