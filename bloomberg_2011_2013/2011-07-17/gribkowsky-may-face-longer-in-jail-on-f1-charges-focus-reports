Former Bayerische Landesbank risk
manager Gerhard Gribkowsky may face a longer term in prison as
German prosecutors plan to bring further charges,  Focus  magazine
reported, without citing anyone.  Munich state prosecutors plan to charge Gribkowsky with
corruption in “the course of office,” rather than in “the
course of business,” Focus said. Gribkowsky was arrested on
Jan. 5 over allegations that he received a $50 million kickback
for engineering the sale of BayernLB’s stake in the Formula One
racing tournament. The additional charges would double the
maximum sentence for the 53-year-old to 10 years, according to
the report.  Barbara Stockinger, a spokeswoman for the prosecutors,
didn’t answer her mobile phone outside office hours today.
Gribkowsky’s attorney Reinhard Hoess didn’t immediately return a
call to his office phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
