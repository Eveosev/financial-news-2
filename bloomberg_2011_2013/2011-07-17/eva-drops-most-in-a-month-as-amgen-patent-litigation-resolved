Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
declined the most in four weeks after a U.S. district court
found that the world’s largest maker of generic drugs infringed
Amgen Inc. patents relating to human G-CSF.  The shares slid 2.6 percent to 165 shekels at 4:30 p.m. in
Tel Aviv, their largest drop since June 19. The company’s 30-day
implied volatility climbed to 34.1 percent, its highest in at
least a year.  Teva is looking for new sources of growth as its multiple-
sclerosis injection treatment Copaxone, which generated 22
percent of sales in the last quarter, faces competition from the
first multiple-sclerosis pill,  Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Gilenya. An April
trial of laquinimod, a multiple-sclerosis pill under development
by Active Biotech AB and Teva, fell short of expectations.  The court in the U.S. issued an injunction on July 16 that
prevented Teva from selling its Neutroval treatment in the U.S.
until Nov. 10, 2013, according to a PR Newswire statement. Teva
agreed not to sell its Neugranin medicine, another G-CSF
product, until the same date.  Sabina Podval, an analyst at Leader & Co. Investment House
in  Tel Aviv , said that the court decision was not significant to
Teva, as the drug had yet to receive approval from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration. Podval said the shares fell today,
following a two-day slide in U.S. trading while the Tel Aviv
market was closed.  Teva declined 2.6 percent in its last two days of trading
in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
