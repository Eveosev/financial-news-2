Corn may gain for the third straight
week and soybeans may rise for a fourth week on speculation that
temperatures topping 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) will
damage reproducing crops in the U.S. Midwest.  Twenty-two of 31 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to Chicago on July 15 forecast that corn will rise, and 21
respondents said soybeans will gain.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery rose 7.5 percent to $6.85 a bushel, the most
in eight weeks, and soybean futures for November delivery
climbed 3 percent to $13.87 a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s gains in corn and soybeans were expected by the
majority of analysts and traders surveyed on July 8.  Bullish on corn: 22    Bullish on soybeans: 21
Bearish on corn:  9    Bearish on soybeans: 10  To contact the reporter on this story:
