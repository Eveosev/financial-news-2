Support for  Poland ’s ruling party,
the  Civic Platform , was unchanged this week at 34.5 percent,
public broadcaster  Polskie Radio ’s Program I reported, citing a
poll by research company Homo Homini.  Support for the largest opposition party, Law & Justice,
increased 1.8 percentage points to 29.1 percent from Warsaw-
based  Homo Homini’s  previous poll a week earlier.  Homo Homini conducted its phone survey of 1,100 adults on
July 15. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
