U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  said he was “incredibly worried” another financial
crisis will result from the turmoil in government debt in the
U.S. and  Europe .  “The gravity of the uncertainty in the U.S., which is
basically a product of gridlock, and the growing sovereign
crisis” are a concern, he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr program
today. “This has a direct impact on British jobs and the
livelihood of millions of people in this country.” The U.K.
“should play an active role, behind the scenes,” in official
negotiations in Europe, he said.  In a separate interview today with Sky News, former Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi said the U.S. must negotiate a
budget agreement soon to support the dollar and salvage the
country’s credit rating.  “If the Republicans and Democrats don’t find a quick
agreement the dollar cannot be out of the storm,” he said.
“The situation from the political point of view is not
different” from  Italy , where political agreement has produced
an austerity plan that will “calm” the nation’s bond market.  In Italy, “in front of the danger, the decision was united
and quick,” he said. “I hope that will happen in the  United
States , otherwise some sort of downgrading will be necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
