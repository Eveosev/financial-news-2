Manchester United  is interested in
Santos attacking midfielder Paulo Henrique Ganso, who is likely
to leave his Brazilian club in January, the People reported.  Santos values the 21-year-old at 45 million pounds ($72.6
million), although an agreement has been reached with his agent
that may allow Ganso to leave for a fee of about 25 million
pounds,  the newspaper said , without citing anyone.   AC Milan is Gansoâ€™s preferred destination, but they may be
unable to compete financially with Premier League soccer
champion United, the People reported. Tottenham and Paris St.
