Four policemen were detained in
 Jordan  amid an investigation into an attack on a pro-reform
march in Amman two days ago.  The outcome of the probe will be announced in the next few
days and those involved will stand trial, said Lt. Gen. Hussein Majali, director of the kingdom’s Public Security Department, in
a  statement  carried by the official news agency Petra. The
investigation relied on video footage made available to a
committee of senior security and legal officials, he said.  Reporters, photographers and protesters were beaten and
hospitalized for treatment after a police clampdown on a protest
in Amman organized by Islamist-led opposition groups on July 15,
according to Petra and local newspapers. The Jordan Press
Association called for a sit-in today to protest the attacks on
journalists, the Jordan Times said.  Jordan’s opposition has staged protests this year to demand
reform and an end to corruption, inspired by pro-democracy
revolts that ousted the longstanding leaders of Tunisia and
 Egypt .  King Abdullah  has responded by changing the government
twice this year and by promising to ease restraints on political
parties and allow the formation of governments based on a
parliamentary majority, without saying when this could happen.  The opposition has considered the measures cosmetic and
continues to demand the resignation of the government of Prime
Minister  Marouf Bakhit . It accuses security forces and pro-
regime supporters of violently breaking up the demonstrations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
