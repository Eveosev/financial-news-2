Germany and  France  must openly
guarantee all euro-region sovereign debt to prevent the breakup
of the single currency union, Harvard University economist
Kenneth Rogoff told Corriere della Sera.  The governments of the two countries “must become the
guarantor of last resort of all bonds issued in the euro area,”
Rogoff, the International Monetary Fund’s former chief
economist, told the  Milan daily  in an interview published today.  Europe’s sovereign crisis will only end when international
investors understand they’ll run into a “German wall” if they
speculate against any other euro-region country, Rogoff said,
according to Corriere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
