China Suntien Green Energy Corp., a
distributor of natural gas and an operator of wind farms, said
it expects net profit for the six months ended June to increase
by more than 100 percent from the same period of last year.  This “is mainly due to the significant improvement” in
the performance of the wind power operations, it said in a
statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The natural gas
business maintained “steady growth,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
