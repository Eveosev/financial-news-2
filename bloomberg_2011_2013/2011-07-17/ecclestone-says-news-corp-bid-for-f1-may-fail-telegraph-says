News Corp. (NWSA)  will probably fail to buy
the Formula One racing tournament because F1 Chief Executive
Officer Bernie Ecclestone doesn’t want to put the sport on pay
television, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported.  “It isn’t possible that F1 could go on to pay-TV, we
wouldn’t want to do that,” Ecclestone told the Telegraph.  Ecclestone told the newspaper he’s “terribly sorry” for
News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch, and that people might object to
the bid because of the phone-hacking scandal at the newspaper
publisher. He has had no contact from News Corp. about a
takeover, the newspaper said.  News Corp. and  Exor SpA (EXO)  said in May that they were
“exploring the possibility of creating a consortium to buy
F1,” the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
