Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said introducing common euro-region bonds, or Eurobonds, would
undermine the incentives for  Greece ’s government to enforce
fiscal discipline,  Bild-Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  “Nothing would destroy the incentives for a solid fiscal
policy more rapidly and more permanently than joint liability
for the state’s debt,” Weidmann was cited as saying. “The
result will be that European and especially German taxpayers
have to answer for the entire Greek state liabilities. It would
be a step toward a transfer union, which Germany has until now
rejected for good reasons.”  Weidmann added that cutting Greece’s debt wouldn’t help as
long as the country runs a  budget deficit , Bild-Zeitung said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
