The U.S. and  Japan  are scoreless at
halftime of soccer’s Women’s World Cup championship game.  The U.S. controlled play for the majority of the opening 45
minutes at Commerzbank Arena in Frankfurt, holding a 14-6
advantage in shots. The Americans missed numerous scoring
chances, including one in the first minute.   After Lauren Cheney, Carli Lloyd and Megan Rapinoe all sent
shots just wide or over the net in a three-minute span, Abby
Wambach failed to convert another U.S. opportunity in the 28th
minute when her strike from just inside the box hit the
underside of the crossbar and bounced away.   Japan’s best chance of the first half came in the 30th
minute, when an angled shot was smothered by U.S. goaltender
Hope Solo.  The U.S., which finished third at the past two World Cups,
is seeking to add to the titles it won in 1991 and 1999. The
Americans beat  France  in the semifinals to return to the
championship match for the first time since beating  China  in a
penalty shootout 12 years ago in  Pasadena ,  California .   Japan is trying to win its first Women’s World Cup title.
Japan reached the semifinals with a 1-0 win over two-time
defending champion and host Germany, which is ranked second in
the world. The Japanese then beat Sweden 3-1 to become the
second Asian nation to reach the final, joining China in 1999.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
