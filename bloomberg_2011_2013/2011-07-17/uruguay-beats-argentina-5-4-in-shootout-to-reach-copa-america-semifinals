Uruguay ousted host  Argentina  from
soccer’s Copa America as Carlos Tevez missed the only penalty in
a shootout after the teams tied their quarterfinal 1-1.  Uruguay, a semifinalist at last year’s World Cup in  South
Africa , won 5-4 on penalties at the Estadio Colon in Santa Fe
last night after extra time failed to produce a winner. Tevez
had his penalty, Argentina's third of the shootout, saved by 
Uruguayan goalkeeper Fernando Muslera.  Diego Perez put Uruguay ahead in the fifth minute before
 Gonzalo Higuain  tied it 12 minutes later. Both teams finished
with 10 men after 90 minutes. Perez was ejected in the 38th
minute for a second yellow card and Argentina lost captain
 Javier Mascherano  in similar fashion with four minutes left.  Uruguay, which shares a record 14 titles in South America’s
continental championship with Argentina, will play Peru in the
first semifinal on July 19 in La Plata.  Carlos Lobaton and Juan Vargas scored extra-time goals in
Cordoba yesterday as Peru beat Colombia 2-0 in the first
quarterfinal.  Eight-time champion Brazil, seeking its fifth title in the
past six editions, faces Paraguay today for a place in the
semifinals before Chile takes on Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
