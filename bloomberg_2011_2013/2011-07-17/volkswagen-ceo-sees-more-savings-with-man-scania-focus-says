Volkswagen AG (VOW)  plans to create cost-
savings for  MAN SE (MAN)  and  Scania AB (SCVB)  by selling car technology to
the two truckmakers as it integrates them with its operations,
 Focus  magazine said, citing Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn.  Europe’s biggest carmaker would be able to sell safety and
driver-assistance systems such as lane-switching aids to MAN and
Scania at a rebate as part of the integration process, Focus
said. The trucks would also benefit from VW’s car-interior
technology, Winterkorn was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
