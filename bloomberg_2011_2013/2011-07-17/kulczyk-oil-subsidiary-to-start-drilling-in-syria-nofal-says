Loon Latakia, a fully owned
subsidiary of  Kulczyk Oil Ventures Inc. (KOV) , will begin drilling its
first exploratory well in northwestern Syria this week.  The  oil company , controlled by Polish billionaire  Jan Kulczyk , will start drilling Itheria-1 well in Block 9 by the
end of this week, Ammar Nofal, regional director of Loon
Latakia, said in a telephone interview in Damascus today.  “The drilling rig is now on site,” Nofal said. “The
drilling of the first well should be complete by mid-September
and, shortly after that, we will start drilling the second
well,” he said.  Itheria is estimated to contain reserves of 338 million
barrels of oil equivalent, according to a statement issued by
Kulczyk on June 8.  Calgary-based Kulczyk Oil won the right to explore the
block in 2007. It has a 70 percent participating interest in the
10,032-square-kilometer (3,870-square-mile) site in northwest
Syria. The Warsaw-listed company has agreements to assign 25
percent in ownership interests to third parties, subject to the
approval of the Syrian authorities, the company then said.  Syria’s oil reserves are the ninth-largest in the Middle
East, according to data from BP Plc, and the country is trying
to halt its declining crude output.  Thirteen foreign companies, including Kulczyk,  Total SA (FP) ,
 Eni SpA (ENI)  and China National Petroleum Corp., have submitted bids
for exploration rights to eight onshore blocks covering 40
percent of the country. Syria has also asked companies to submit
bids for three offshore concessions by Oct. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
