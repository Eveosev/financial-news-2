Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  said he would pay up to 500 million pesos ($284,400) for
information leading to the capture of those at the head of
 Colombia â€™s largest guerrilla group in a region where Chinese
workers were kidnapped last month.  Santos made the offer in a statement posted on the
presidential  website  yesterday.  Colombia officials are seeking tips that would allow
authorities to apprehend leaders of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, in the provinces of Huila and
Caqueta, according to a statement.  Three workers and a translator of a contracting company
hired by Emerald Energy Plc, a unit of Beijing-based Sinochem
Group, were taken on June 8 in Caqueta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
