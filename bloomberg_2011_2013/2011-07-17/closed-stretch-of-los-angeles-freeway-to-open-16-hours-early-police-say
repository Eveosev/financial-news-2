A section of Interstate 405 thatâ€™s
the busiest stretch of freeway in  Los Angeles  will open at 11:30
a.m. local time, 16 hours ahead of schedule, following a weekend
shutdown for the demolition of an overhead bridge.  The northbound and southbound lanes of the 10-mile (16-
kilometer) section of freeway will open first, followed by on-
ramps and then by connector ramps to the 10 and 101 freeways,
the Los Angeles Police Department said in a text message to
media.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
