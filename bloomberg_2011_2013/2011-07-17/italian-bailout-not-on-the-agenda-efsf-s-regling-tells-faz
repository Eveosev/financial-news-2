Klaus Regling, chief executive
officer of the European Financial Stability Facility, said a
bailout of  Italy  is “not on the table at the moment” and the
country’s savings plan is “pretty convincing,”  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  reported, citing an interview.  The country’s banking system is “robust,” Regling was
cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
