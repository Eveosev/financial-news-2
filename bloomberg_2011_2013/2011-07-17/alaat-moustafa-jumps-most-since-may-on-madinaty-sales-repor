Talaat Moustafa Group (TMGH)  Holding,
 Egypt ’s biggest publicly traded real-estate developer, jumped
the most since May in Cairo trading after  Al Mal  said sales from
the Madinaty housing project will reach 27.5 billion Egyptian
pounds ($4.6 billion) by the end of this year.  The shares rose 6.3 percent to 4.71 Egyptian pounds as of
the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the steepest gain since May 29.
That gave the company a market value of 9.72 billion pounds. The
benchmark EGX30 Index advanced 3.3 percent.  Talaat Moustafa said in a statement today that the sales
figure reported by  Al Mal  refers to the project’s total sales by
the end of the year since it was started. The Cairo-based
newspaper cited Deputy Chief Financial Officer Tarek El Naggar.  Madinaty is designed to include 120,000 homes and house
600,000 people on Cairo’s outskirts. The project, which is
supposed to be built over 25 years, includes a golf course,
hotels, commercial space, a shopping center and schools.  The Egyptian Exchange lifted a trading suspension on Talaat
Moustafa shares at 12:45 p.m., according to Bloomberg data. The
bourse halted trading while it awaited the company’s response to
the newspaper report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
