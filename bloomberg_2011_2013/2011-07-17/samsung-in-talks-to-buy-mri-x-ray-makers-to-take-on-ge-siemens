Samsung Electronics Co., whose
empire ranges from memory chips to televisions, is in talks to
buy makers of MRI scanners and X-ray machines to challenge
 General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Siemens AG (SIE)  in medical equipment.  Samsung is in “contact” with some companies, Senior Vice
President Jo Jae Moon, who leads a team of medical-equipment
developers, said in an interview in  Seoul  on July 15, without
elaborating on the potential targets. The company has said it
plans to spend 1.2 trillion won ($1.1 billion) in the medical-
equipment business by 2020.  Any purchases would build on Chairman Lee Kun Hee’s plans
to build the medical-equipment operations into one that
generates 10 trillion won in annual sales. Lee is counting on
demand for health-care gear to spur sales of scanners as the
proportion of elderly residents in markets from the U.S. to
 Europe  and Japan climb to records each year.  “Demand for expensive medical equipment will keep
growing,” said Bae Ki Dal, an analyst at Shinhan Investment
Corp. in Seoul. “The market is mostly dominated by foreign
companies now. It will be interesting to see how Samsung will
compete with them.”  Samsung fell 2.3 percent to 813,000 won at the 3:00 p.m.
close of trading in Seoul, while the benchmark Kospi index lost
0.7 percent. Value Added Technologies Co., which supplies parts
for X-ray machines, jumped 8.3 percent to 10,500 won, the
biggest daily gain since Feb. 24. Medical-gear maker Vieworks
Co. surged 15 percent to 16,250 won, the most since April, 2009.  No. 1 Target  The maker of Galaxy phones and tablet computers, with a
plan to invest 23.3 trillion won in new businesses by 2020, made
its biggest acquisitions in the health-care industry last year
when it bought a controlling 43.5 percent stake in diagnostic
ultrasound devices maker  Medison Co. , as well as 100 percent of
Prosonic from Consus Asset Management Co. for 331.3 billion won.
Samsung increased its stake in Medison to 65.8 percent in April.  “We have a lot of companies on our list, and we’ve been
contacting most of them,” Jo said, adding that Samsung prefers
to acquire small companies overseas with niche technology.
“We’ll continue to meet them and negotiate. We have a target to
be the No. 1 across ultrasound devices, X-rays and MRIs.”  Jo is also head of the Medison’s research center.  Samsung is making a push into an industry led by General
Electric, which had $16.9 billion of revenue from health care
last year, a growth of 5.6 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Siemens had 12.3 billion euros ($17.4 billion) in
revenue from medical solutions, a 3.4 percent increase.  Aging Population  Royal Philips Electronics NV grew its medical systems
business 10 percent to 8.6 billion euros, data show.  By comparison, 24.3 percent of Samsung’s revenue last year
was from semiconductors and 26.6 percent from telecommunications
equipment. The company’s total revenue is expected to grow 7.9
percent to 167 trillion won this year, according to the average
of 36 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Samsung is expanding into health care as its overall
revenue grows at the slowest pace in five years and as
populations worldwide get older. The number of people aged 65
and above will account for 8.3 percent of the world’s population
by 2014, compared with 7.9 percent this year, according to U.S.
Census Bureau data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan  may be the
oldest society, with the portion of elderly projected to account
for 25 percent of the population in three years.  Medison  Besides takeovers, Samsung will also invest to boost hiring
as well as research and development at its own medical-equipment
business, where the number of staff grew from less than 10
people in 2009 to more than 200 now, Jo said.  Medison aims to increase sales by more than fivefold to
$1.6 billion by 2020 from last year, he said. The company had a
5 percent share in the global market for diagnostic ultrasound
devices last year and targets to increase that to 24 percent
within a decade, Jo said.  The company may roll out its first products with the new
Medison brand in the second half, Jo said.  Closely-held Medison, which currently has more than 1,000
employees globally with 12 overseas branches, may set up a
research base in  Seattle , Jo said. The company will also seek
more patents, he said.  Medison was set up in 1985 and went bankrupt in 2002
because of excessive expansion. The company was taken over by
Consus in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
