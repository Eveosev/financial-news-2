China  produces about 40 million
metric tons of steel a year more than it reports, which may be
contributing to higher  iron ore  prices, the Financial Times
reported, citing research by U.K. steel consultancy, MEPS
(International) Ltd. Chinese steel production last year was 672
million metric tons, while the Chinese government reported the
country made 627 million metric tons of steel, the FT said.  The higher steel output has created additional demand for
iron ore, the main constituent of steel, the FT said, citing
MEPS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
