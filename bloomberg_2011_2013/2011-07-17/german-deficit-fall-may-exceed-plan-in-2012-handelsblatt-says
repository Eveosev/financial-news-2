Germany ’s budget deficit will
probably fall to 19 billion euros ($27 billion) next year after
a shortfall of 29 billion euros in 2011,  Handelsblatt  said,
citing the IfW Kiel Institute of the World Economy.  The 2012 forecast is about 8 billion euros lower than the
 Finance Ministry ’s plan and beats most recent government
estimates, the newspaper cited said. The reason for the
improvement is a rise in the country’s aggregate wages, which
will increase more strongly than the 4.4 percent gain in the
first quarter, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
