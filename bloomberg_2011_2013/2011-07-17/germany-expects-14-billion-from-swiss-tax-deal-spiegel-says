Germany ’s Finance Ministry expects
to receive about 10 billion euros ($14.2 billion) from the Swiss
government as part of an agreement on  tax evasion ,  Der Spiegel 
reported, citing unnamed ministry officials.  Switzerland will deduct 20 percent to 30 percent of funds
derived from unreported income, the ministry estimated,
according to the report. After the deduction, the unreported
income will be legalized, and the names of tax evaders won’t be
published by Swiss authorities, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
