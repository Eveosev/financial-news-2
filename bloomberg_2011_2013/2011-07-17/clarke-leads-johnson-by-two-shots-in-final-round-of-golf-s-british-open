Darren Clarke of  Northern Ireland 
holds a two-stroke lead over American Dustin Johnson in the
final round of the British Open as golfers face high winds for a
second straight day.  Clarke had a birdie at the second hole to move to 6-under
par, with Johnson 4-under. Both made par on the first hole at
Royal St. George’s in Sandwich, England, after putting their tee
shots into the rough.  Gusting winds up to 35 miles per hour (56 kilometers per
hour) are forecast this afternoon, along with possible heavy
rain showers, according to the U.K. Met Office.  “I would say with the leaders having a little bit of
pressure on them, those three, four footers are going to be
awfully tough today because when you’re looking down at the ball
there are times when the ball’s beginning to oscillate on the
greens,”  England ’s Justin Rose, who shot 70 to finish 11-over
said. “It’s going to be very tricky.”  Rickie Fowler of the U.S. and Denmark’s  Thomas Bjorn  have
started with two pars to remain 2-under. Phil Mickelson and
 Anthony Kim  each birdied the second hole to tie fellow American
 Lucas Glover  at 1-under.  Both Clarke and Johnson are seeking their first major
title. Clarke is playing in his 20th open with his best finish
being a tie for second in 1997.  Johnson played in the final group at two majors last year,
losing a three-shot lead at the  U.S. Open  and incurring a
penalty with a one-shot lead on the final hole at the U.S. PGA
Championship which cost him a place in a playoff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
