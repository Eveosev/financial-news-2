The U.S. government has sent
Switzerland a letter saying it’s not interested in talks to
resolve the conflict over  tax evasion , SonntagsZeitung said,
citing a person close to the situation it didn’t name.  Roland Meier, a government spokesman, declined to confirm
or deny the letter, the newspaper said, adding it was sent two
weeks ago.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said on July 15 that the U.S.
Department of Justice is investigating it over former cross-
border private-banking services to U.S. customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
