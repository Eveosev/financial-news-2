Niger plans to post average economic
growth of about 7 percent during the next five years, according
to President Mahamadou Issoufou.  The West African nation is also targeting an inflation rate
of about 3 percent during that period, Issoufou said yesterday
during a live debate on state-owned broadcaster Télé Sahel.  “We are now recording success,” said Issoufou, who’s
celebrating his first 100 days in power. “My government wants
to reverse the trend with a program based on a steady average of
7 percent and an average inflation rate of 3 percent over the
period of my mandate to modernize the economy, accelerate growth
and ensure its equitable distribution.”  Growth remains “very volatile,” Issoufou said. Gross
domestic product expanded 9.6 percent in 2008 and shrank 0.9
percent in 2009 before rising 8 percent last year, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
