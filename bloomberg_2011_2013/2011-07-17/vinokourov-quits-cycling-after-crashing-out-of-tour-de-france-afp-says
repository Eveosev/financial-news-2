Kazakh cyclist Alexandre Vinokourov
announced his retirement from the sport, a week after crashing
out of the  Tour de France  with a thigh fracture, Agence France-
Press reported.  “I will continue to ride my bike, but as an amateur and
just to keep fit,” Vinokourov, 37, was cited as telling French
television.  “As far as competing goes, I think I will leave it
there.”  He may remain in the sport as manager or sporting director
of his Astana team, AFP added.  Vinokourov’s career included four Tour de  France  stage
wins, and he came third in the race in 2003. He won the Tour of
Spain in 2006 and had two successes in the Liege-Bastogne-Liege
one-day classic.  He was banned for two years after testing positive for
blood doping in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
