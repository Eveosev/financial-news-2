Possible bidders for  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY) ’s 632 bank branches want Lloyds to reduce the price of
the assets and are delaying or failing to put forward their bids
until the “quality” of the offer is raised, the Telegraph
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Virgin Money Holdings U.K. Ltd. didn’t present a formal
offer for the Lloyds branches last week and has written to
Lloyds about lowering its price, the Telegraph said, citing
unnamed sources.  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  may be in talks
with Lloyds about presenting a late bid, the newspaper also
said, citing unidentified people.  Clive Cowdery, insurance entrepreneur, was discouraged from
making a bid when he saw that the package was “not attractive
enough,” the Telegraph said, citing unnamed sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
