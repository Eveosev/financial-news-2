Ray Coyle, founder of Irish potato
crisp maker Largo Foods, is selling a 25 percent stake in the
company to German snack maker Intersnack, the Sunday Times
reported, citing an interview with Coyle.  Coyle is selling a further 11 percent stake in the company,
based in Ashbourne, south of Dublin, to a private German
investment firm, the newspaper said. Intersnack already owns 15
percent of the Irish firm, according to the Sunday Times.  Coyle aims to double the size of the company in five years
and needs additional capital for the expansion, the newspaper
said. Coyle didnâ€™t disclose the size of the deal, the Sunday
Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
