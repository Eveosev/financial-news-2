Tens of thousands of people held
pro-democracy rallies in the southern Yemen city of Taiz on the
anniversary of President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s rule, activist
Ammar al-Kinani said.  This was the largest demonstration in the city since May
with more than 1 million people, al-Kinani said in a telephone
interview. Men and women carried pieces of black cloth, chanting
slogans against July 17, the day 33 years ago that Saleh took
power in the Arabian Peninsula country.  Hundreds of people have died in clashes since January
between government forces and activists seeking to end the rule
of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The president is recovering in
a Saudi hospital after an attack on his compound last month.  A Yemeni youth movement said yesterday it established a
transitional presidential council with 17 members and appointed
Major General Abdullah Ali Olaiwah, a former defense minister,
as commander of the armed forces.  -- Editor: Andrew J. Barden, Digby Lidstone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
