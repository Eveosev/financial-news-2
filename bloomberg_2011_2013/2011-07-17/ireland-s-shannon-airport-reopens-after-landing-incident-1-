Ireland’s Shannon airport has
reopened after an aircraft operated by Aer Arann veered off the
runway.  The  Aer Lingus (AERL)  Group Plc flight, which departed Manchester
airport at 8.50 a.m. today, “experienced a suspected failure of
the nose wheel landing gear and veered off the runway onto the
grass,” Aer Arann said on its website. The plane experienced
difficulties as it attempted to land during its second approach
to Shannon, the airline said.  None of the 21 passengers or four crew members were
injured, Aer Arann said. The cause of the incident is being
investigated, it said.  The airport reopened just after 4 p.m.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
