The  European Central Bank  renewed
its call for politicians to empower  Europe ’s rescue fund to buy
 government bonds  on the secondary market.  ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said in an
interview with  Greece ’s To Vima newspaper that it would be
“useful” to allow the European Financial Stability Facility to
buy bonds on the open market, according to a transcript
published by the Frankfurt-based ECB today.  “This would allow the private sector to sell bonds at
their market value, which is currently lower than the nominal
value,” Bini Smaghi said. “This would allow the private sector
to sell while the public sector would save money. Such an option
was not included in the design of the EFSF. If there is a way to
change the EFSF, that would be useful.”  European leaders in March declined to authorize the EFSF to
purchase bonds on the secondary market -- a role the ECB assumed
last year as the Greek debt crisis escalated.  Bini Smaghi  said
the onus remains on Greece to pursue its fiscal consolidation
program. He also encouraged Greek banks to sell foreign assets.  “The Greek banks have to sell some assets abroad, get
fresh money in the system to be able to contribute to the
recovery, do mergers even with foreign banks to bring foreign
capital,” he said. “If you consider the fully hypothetical
situation in which all Greek banks were owned by foreign capital,
as was the case in eastern Europe, then a lot of problems in
Greece would be eased.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
