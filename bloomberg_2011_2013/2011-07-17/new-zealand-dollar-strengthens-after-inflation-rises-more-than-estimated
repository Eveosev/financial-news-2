The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars dropped on speculation European leaders will fail to
agree on measures to resolve the region’s debt crisis at a
summit this week, curbing appetite for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie declined for a third straight day against the
greenback as traders added to bets the  Reserve Bank  of Australia
will cut interest rates in the next 12 months. New Zealand’s
currency snapped a three-day advance versus the dollar and yen
as U.S. and Asian stocks slumped.  “For this week, it’s still the focus from offshore that
will be the main driver for currencies,” said Khoon Goh, head
of market economics and strategy at ANZ National Bank Ltd. in
Wellington. “Both the kiwi and Aussie are really just falling
in sympathy with what’s happening in the euro.”  Australia ’s dollar fell 0.8 percent to $1.0573 at 11:10
a.m. in New York, from $1.0653 on July 15, when it slid 0.7
percent. The currency dropped 0.8 percent to 83.64 yen. New
Zealand’s dollar weakened 0.2 percent to 84.34 U.S. cents and
lost 0.3 percent to 66.72 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.2 percent. The
MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index of shares declined for a
third day, losing 0.7 percent.  Euro-area leaders will meet in Brussels on July 21 to
discuss efforts to halt the crisis, European Union President
 Herman Van Rompuy  said in a statement July 15. The second summit
in a month follows the worsening of the debt concern that pushed
 Italy  to the attention of investors and drove bond yields to
euro-area records for Europe’s most debt-laden nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
