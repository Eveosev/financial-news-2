Hosni Mubarak  is in stable condition
after suffering a drop in  blood pressure , according to Assem
Azzam, the head of the medical team in the Sharm el-Sheikh
hospital supervising the former Egyptian president’s health.  Mubarak’s lawyer, Farid elDib, earlier said that Mubarak
had slipped into a coma after suffering a stroke. Azzam,
speaking in a telephone interview, denied the report.  Egypt ’s public prosecutor ordered in May that Mubarak and
his two sons, Gamal and Alaa, be tried in a criminal court on
charges of killing demonstrators and abusing public office.
Mubarak’s three-decade rule ended in February when he ceded
interim power to Egypt’s Supreme Council of the Armed Forces
after 18 days of mass protests. Mubarak has denied all charges
against him, elDib said.  A medical committee that examined Mubarak concluded he
can’t be transferred to prison, saying his health is
“unstable,” the public prosecutor’s office said in May.  The six-member committee asked that Mubarak remain under
the supervision of a medical team in Sharm el-Sheikh. It found
that Mubarak suffers from heart conditions, depression and
“muscle weakness” and needs to be helped out of bed.  Mubarak may also be suffering from a cancer relapse, elDib
said in June, requesting that a German doctor be allowed to
examine him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
