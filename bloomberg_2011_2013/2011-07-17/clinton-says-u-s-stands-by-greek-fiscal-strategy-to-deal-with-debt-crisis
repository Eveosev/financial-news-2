U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary
Clinton  praised  Greece ’s medium-term fiscal strategy as “vital
first steps.”  “We know these were not easy decisions, they were acts of
leadership,” Clinton said today in Athens. She said the
challenge will be “to keep moving forward with the same
determination and commitment.”  “While the payoff for these sacrifices will not come
quickly, it will come,” Clinton said. “We know the price of
inaction would have been far higher.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
