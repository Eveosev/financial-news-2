Possible instability in  Italy ’s
government may fuel investor concern over its ability to meet
fiscal goals, Arrigo Sadun, the International Monetary Fund’s
executive director for Italy, told  Corriere della Sera .  Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  is “fundamental” to the
country’s image among investors, who view him as “the guarantor
of stability of Italian public accounts,” Sadun was cited as
saying by the Milan-based newspaper today. Investor concern over
Italy’s ability to meet its deficit-cutting goals will return if
there are doubts over the government’s stability, he said.  Italy must also carry out “deep structural reforms” to
convince investors it can speed up economic growth to help cut
 Europe ’s biggest nominal debt, Sadun told Corriere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
