Latvia ’s government approved
strategies to sell Parex Banka AS and Citadele Bank, the  Baltic
News Service  cited Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis as saying
today at a news conference in Riga.  Citadele will be sold at an auction after two rounds of
screening for potential bidders, based on a strategy developed
by Nomura International Plc, the newswire said. The process will
begin in the “nearest future,” it said.  Parex will not be sold as a whole “for now,” the newswire
said.  Citadele was split from Parex Banka, Latvia’s second-
biggest lender, after a rush on deposits forced the government
to rescue the bank in 2008. Latvia then turned to a group led by
the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5
billion-euro ($10.6 billion) bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
