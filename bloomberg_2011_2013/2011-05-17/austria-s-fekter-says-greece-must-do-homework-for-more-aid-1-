Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said  Greece  “must do its homework” and “show progress
on privatization” to win a new rescue package from its European
Union partners.  Euro-area finance chiefs, meeting in Brussels yesterday,
endorsed a 78 billion-euro ($111 billion) bailout for  Portugal 
as they stepped up pressure on Greece to do more to win improved
aid terms.  Fekter spoke to reporters before a second round of talks
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
