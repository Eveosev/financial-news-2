 President  Barack Obama  may urge
Israel to halt West Bank settlement expansion and return to the
1967 borders in his Middle East policy speech on Thursday,
Yediot Ahranot said, citing “a draft” of the speech it said
had been obtained “which may change again.”   Obama will also reject the Palestinian Authority’s planned
bid to obtain recognition as a state at the  United Nations  next
September, Yediot said.  The U.S. president will also call on Israel and the
Palestinians to share sovereignty of Jerusalem, Yediot said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
