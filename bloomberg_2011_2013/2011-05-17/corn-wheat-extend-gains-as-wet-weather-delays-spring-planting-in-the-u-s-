Corn rose for a fourth day in  Chicago 
and soybeans climbed after a report showed U.S. sowing lagged
behind the pace of recent years as many fields remained too
soggy for heavy farm machinery.  About 63 percent of the U.S. corn crop, the world’s
biggest, was  planted  as of May 15, according to the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture . That compares with 40 percent a week
earlier and 87 percent a year earlier. The average was 75
percent from 2006 to 2010.  “Given the tight supplies of old crop, the planting delay
of U.S. corn is a concern,” said Han Sung Min, a broker at
 Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  Futures Co. in  Seoul . Wheat was also
supported by the spring crop delay and deteriorating winter-crop
conditions, while the delay in corn planting may encourage U.S.
farmers to increase soybean seeding, Han said.  Corn for July delivery gained 6.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$7.04 a bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices are up 3.9 percent since trading ended on May 11.
The grain almost doubled in the past year.  “Dry weather conditions in the western Midwest prompted
farmers to rush to profit from the finally available window to
advance plantings as much as possible as a delayed maturation
increases the risk of frosts occurring later this season,” said
Jonathan Bouchet, a Zurich-based analyst at OTCex Group.
“However, wet conditions are forecasted to persist for some
time in the eastern Midwest and Delta regions.”  Wheat Sowing  Soybean planting was 22 percent complete, compared with 7
percent a week earlier, 37 percent a year earlier and the five-
year average of 31 percent, the USDA said. About 36 percent of
the spring-wheat crop was seeded, against 22 percent a week
earlier and an average 76 percent for the past five years, the
USDA said.  Soybeans for July delivery rose 4.25 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $13.3075 a bushel, the first increase in three days. The
oilseed gained 41 percent in the past year.  About 44 percent of the U.S. winter wheat crop was in very
poor or poor condition, compared with 42 percent a week earlier
and 8 percent a year earlier, the USDA said.  Wheat for July delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.1 percent, to
$7.375 a bushel. The grain jumped 57 percent in the past year,
partly as the worst Russian drought in 50 years cut world
stockpiles. Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE
Liffe in Paris slipped 25 cents, or 0.1 percent, to 228.50 euros
($323.67) a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
