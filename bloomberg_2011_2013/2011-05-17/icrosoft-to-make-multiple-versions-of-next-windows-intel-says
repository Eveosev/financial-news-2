Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  will make multiple
versions of its next Windows operating system, with four that
work on  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  technology, according to an  Intel Corp. (INTC) 
executive.  The version designed for Intel chips will run older Windows
programs, Renee James, head of Intel’s software business, said
today in a presentation at the company’s Santa Clara,
California, headquarters. The ARM versions won’t run older
programs, she said. They will be tailored to mobile devices and
tablet computers and there will also be a version for Intel
chips to address that market.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is scrambling to
introduce a version of Windows that does a better job of letting
computer makers build rivals to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad. Microsoft
said personal computer shipments to consumers fell last quarter
partially because customers switched from cheap netbooks to
tablet computers. That decline also was a factor in slumping
sales for Microsoft’s Windows unit in the quarter.  The website  WinRumors  reported last month that the company
appeared to be building multiple versions of the program for use
on ARM-based chips.  Mark Martin, a Microsoft spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
