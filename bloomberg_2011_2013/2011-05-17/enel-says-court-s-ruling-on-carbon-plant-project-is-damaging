Enel SpA (ENEL) ,  Italy ’s biggest energy
company, said a court decision to halt the conversion of its
Porto Tolle thermoelectric plant to coal will damage the
country’s economy.  The decision “may cancel a project necessary for the
country’s energy safety,” Rome-based Enel said in an e-mailed
statement.  Enel said it had planned to invest about 2.5 billion euros
($3.5 billion) over the next five years in the plant. The
company said that while it will try to find other ways to carry
out the Porto Tolle project, it may consider moving some
investments abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
