European jet fuel imports are
increasing as airlines prepare for peak summer travel demand.  About 1.3 million metric tons of the  aviation fuel  were
shipped or provisionally booked to sail to the region from the
Middle East or India this month, according to reports from three
shipbrokers including Delhi-based Interocean Shipping. That
compares with 1.2 million tons in April.  Jet fuel premiums were 80 percent higher this month
compared with a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The northwest  Europe  cargo premium this month
averaged $91.70 a ton above front-month gasoil on London’s ICE
Futures exchange compared with $50.95 last year. The fuel traded
at $1,009 a ton yesterday in Europe.  “We are very much structurally short jet fuel in Europe
and we would expect that to be a good performer,” said Roy Jordan, an analyst at researcher Facts Global Energy in London.  Stockpiles of the product in independent storage at
Europe’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub plummeted
to the lowest level in more than two years last week, according
to Netherlands-based researcher PJK International BV.
Inventories dropped 19 percent to 528,000 tons in the week to
May 12, the least since October 2008.  The following table list a selection of ships scheduled or
provisionally booked in April to carry jet fuel to Europe from
the Middle East or  India , according to shipbroker reports:  To contact the reporter on this story:
