Gold futures fell to a one-week low
as signs that the  U.S. economy  is slowing eroded the appeal of
commodities. Silver dropped more than 2 percent.  Housing starts declined unexpectedly in April, and any
recovery in construction may take years because unemployment is
lingering around 9 percent and wages are stagnant. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials dropped for the
third straight session.  “Precious metals may have difficulty advancing due to
ongoing liquidation of commodity trades,” said Tom Pawlicki, an
analyst at MF Global Holding Ltd. in  Chicago . “Slowing economic
growth has created pressure in stocks and energies and pressured
metals from the deflation angle.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell $10.60, or 0.7 percent,
to settle at $1,480 an ounce at 2 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the price touched $1,471.10, the lowest for a most-
active contract since May 6. The metal is down 6.2 percent from
a record $1,577.40 on May 2.  Soros Fund Management LLC, founded by billionaire  George Soros , sold 99 percent of its holding in the bullion-backed SPDR
Gold Trust during the first quarter, according to a government
filing yesterday. The fund also shed all 5 million shares in the
iShares Gold Trust and cut stakes in NovaGold Resources Inc. and
Kinross Gold Corp., the filing showed.  “It will be clear to own gold” when spot prices touch
$1,425, said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the
Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  Luring Investment  Gold has rallied for more than a decade, attracting
investors including Soros and hedge-fund founder  John Paulson .
Paulson & Co. maintained 31.5 million shares in the SPDR Gold
Trust during the first quarter, and boosted holdings of mining
companies including Barrick Gold Corp. and Gold Fields Ltd.,
according to the fund’s filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  Silver futures for July delivery declined 64.1 cents, or
1.9 percent, to $33.491 an ounce on the Comex. The price has
tumbled 33 percent from a 31-year high of $49.845 on April 25.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose 75 cents to
$714.25 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Platinum
futures for July delivery gained $1 to $1,761 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
