Most Japanese stocks fell, sending
the Topix index to the lowest level since April 19, as Greece
seeking more bailout funds and slower-than-estimated
manufacturing growth in the New York region fueled concerns
about the global economic recovery.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s No. 1 carmaker, slid 1.1
percent.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co., operator of the nuclear plant
crippled by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, plunged 9.5
percent after Moody’s  Japan  K.K. downgraded ratings on the
company’s debt.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  and other
banks fell after the finance minister said creditors need to
help support Tepco while it brings the power station under
control.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 electronics exporter, gained
1.5 percent after the yen weakened, boosting earnings outlook
for exporters.  “The European debt issue is reheating and the momentum of
U.S. economic growth may slow,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general
manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $28 billion. “It’s uncertain what the impact”
of the Tepco issue will be, he said “That’s bad for the
market.”  The Topix index fell 0.1 percent to 828.85 at the close in
Tokyo, with about three shares dropping for every two that
gained. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.1 percent to
9,567.02 yen, after swinging between gains and losses.  The Topix has tumbled 11 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, disabled a nuclear power plant and disrupted
supply chains at companies.  New York Manufacturing  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.6 percent yesterday
in New York as a report showed manufacturing growth in the New
York region cooled and Greece sought additional bailout funds.  Toyota retreated 1.1 percent to 3,305 yen and smaller rival
Honda Motor Co. fell 0.3 percent to 3,120 yen. Toyota and Honda
were the heaviest drags on Topix.  Manufacturing in the  New York  region expanded at a slower
pace than anticipated in May as the cost of raw materials surged.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic index
fell to 11.9 from a one-year high of 21.7 in April, the central
bank reported yesterday. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey
projected it would drop to 19.6, according to the median
forecast. Readings greater than zero signal growth.  Europe Debt  “Optimism on the  U.S. economy  is receding and Greek
financial issues remain uncertain,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “Investors
will likely keep shifting their funds to safe bonds or cash from
risk assets like stocks.”  European finance chiefs endorsed a 78 billion-euro ($111
billion) bailout for  Portugal . Authorities stepped up pressure
on  Greece  to sell assets and deepen spending cuts to win an
increase of its 110 billion-euro aid package and more time to
repay the loans.  A Greek default would be “highly destabilizing” for banks,
causing losses that “far exceed” the size of their loans and
investments there, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  Tepco Plunges  Tokyo Electric, known as Tepco, plunged 9.5 percent to 380
yen, the steepest drop in the Nikkei 225, after Moody’s Japan
K.K. yesterday downgraded its senior secured debt to Baa2 from
Baa1 while rerating its short-term commercial paper to Not Prime
from Prime 2. Moody’s kept Tepco on review for a further
possible downgrade. Also,  Kyodo News  reported Tepco will report
a net loss of more than 800 billion yen ($9.9 billion) for the
fiscal year ended March 31. Tepco said it wasn’t the source of
the report on its earnings.  Utilities were the biggest drag on the Topix among its 33
industry groups today, followed by banks.  Sumitomo Mitsui fell 0.8 percent to 2,381 yen and its
smaller rival  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-biggest
publicly traded lender, lost as much as 1.6 percent after Japan
Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda , said today in Tokyo the
government wanted co-operation between Tokyo Electric Power and
its creditors as part of a plan to tackle worse-than-estimated
damage to the Fukushima Dai-Ichi facility.  MSCI Reshuffles  Sapporo Holdings Ltd. (2501) , Japan’s fourth-largest brewer, slid
3.3 percent to 297 yen and Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co.
retreated 3.6 percent to 270 yen after  MSCI Inc.  said on its
website they were among 20 companies that will be removed from
the benchmark MSCI Japan Index. The changes will be effective as
of the close trading on May 31.  Electronics makers were the biggest contributor to support
the Topix.  Sony, which gets about 70 percent of its revenue overseas,
gained 1.5 percent to 2,275 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest
camera maker, increased 0.3 percent to 3,725 yen, erasing
earlier losses.  The yen depreciated to as low as 81.46 against the dollar
in Tokyo, compared with 80.86 at today’s opening of  stock
trading . Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to 115.54
from 114.39. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
