Gedeon  Richter Nyrt . fell to the
lowest in more than 1 1/2 years after the government said it
will raise a special tax on drugmakers, helping to push the
benchmark BUX stocks index to a fifth consecutive day of losses.  The shares of Hungary’s largest drugmaker retreated 1.9
percent to 35,815 forint by the 5 p.m. close in Budapest, the
lowest close since Sept. 10, 2009. The benchmark BUX of shares
dropped 0.7 percent to 22,979.54, the lowest close since March
29.  Richter, which has a 17 percent weighting in the BUX,
accounted for about half of the measure’s retreat today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Egis Nyrt., the
Hungarian drugmaker owned by Laboratoires Servier, fell 3.3
percent to 19,005 forint.  The government approved a plan today to increase a special
tax on drugmakers to 20 percent from 12 percent, Miklos Szocska,
a state secretary in charge of health care, told reporters in
Budapest. The tax is part of a government strategy to cut its
 budget deficit .  Eastern  Europe ’s public finances have deteriorated, with
debt and budget deficit levels beyond “prudent thresholds,” the
 International Monetary Fund  said in its Regional Economic
Outlook for Europe, released May 12. Hungary along with Albania
and  Turkey  have “uncomfortably” high short-term government debt,
while deficits keep Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania
“vulnerable,” the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
