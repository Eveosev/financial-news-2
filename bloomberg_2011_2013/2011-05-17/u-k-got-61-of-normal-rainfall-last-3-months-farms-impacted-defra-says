The U.K. got about 61 percent of its
normal rainfall in the last three months and low river levels
are starting to impact farms that rely on them for irrigation,
the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.  “The current dry spell is having a negative effect on the
development of cereals,” Defra said in the report on its
website. “Dry conditions are also affecting the livestock
industry in certain parts of the country where grass growth has
been held back.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
