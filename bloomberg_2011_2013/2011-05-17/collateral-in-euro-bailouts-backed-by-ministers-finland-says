Finland  won European backing for its
demand to require collateral from recipients of emergency aid,
said Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen.  “No objections were made” by euro-area finance ministers
at a meeting in Brussels yesterday, Katainen told reporters
today. “There was no problem. I told them that Finland demands
collateral if there will be new bailout packages.”  The requirement to provide security against new loans may
apply to Greece, which is under pressure from  Europe ’s richer
countries to go beyond current plans to sell 50 billion euros
($71 billion) in government assets. The Greek government may set
up a new privatization agency to comply with the demands.  Katainen and his counterparts are discussing providing more
aid to  Greece  and for the first time floated the idea of talks
with bondholders about extending its debt-repayment schedule as
last year’s 110 billion-euro rescue fails to restore the country
to financial health.  “What’s essential is for Greece to stick to the current
program and proceed with the privatization program,” Katainen
said, declining to comment on remarks by Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  that “reprofiling” Greek debt is
being considered.  Katainen first made the demand in a joint statement last
week with Social Democrat leader Jutta Urpilainen, saying
Finland will require collateral from any nations seeking
assistance from the European Financial Stability Facility after
 Portugal .  To contact the reporters on this story:
