Brazil doesn’t rule out employing
 capital controls  to slow the inflows of foreign currencies that
are helping stoke inflation,  Valor Economico  reported, citing a
government official it didn’t identify.  Dollar inflows are fueling the expansion of credit in the
domestic market and inflation, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper
reported. The government is trying to deal with the flows by
adopting macro-prudential measures and “at the limit” may
resort to capital controls, Valor said, citing an unidentified
government official.  The capital inflows dilute the effect of higher  interest
rates , measures to curb credit and spending cuts the government
carried out in its fight against inflation, the person said,
according to Valor.  To contact the reporters on this story:
