Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) ,  India ’s
biggest company by market value, may take three years to drill
new wells in the nation’s largest natural gas block, delaying an
increase in output of the fuel, an industry  website  reported.  The wells can’t be drilled because of commercial and
logistical reasons and may affect production from the D1 and D3
fields of the KG-D6 block, according to the Indianpetro report
dated yesterday, which didn’t say from where it got the
information.  Manoj Warrier, a spokesman for Reliance, declined to
comment when reached on his mobile phone.  Mumbai-based Reliance fell as much as 2.8 percent, the most
since April 25, to 918.40 rupees and was at 919.60 rupees at
1:25 p.m. local time.  The company controlled by billionaire  Mukesh Ambani  is
producing about 48 million cubic meters of gas a day from the
block, S.K. Srivastava, India’s oil regulator, said May 2.  Output has fallen from 60 million cubic meters a day
because of declining pressure, a person with direct knowledge of
the matter said April 11. Reliance needs another year to
complete field studies, the person said.  Reliance sold stakes in 23 Indian oil and gas blocks,
including KG-D6, to BP Plc for $7.2 billion in February as it
seeks technology to raise output.  Output from the D1 and D3 fields may decline to 38 million
cubic meters a day in the year starting April 2012 from about 44
million, Indianpetro reported on March 18, citing the company’s
responses to queries from the oil regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
