The Australian dollar pared earlier
gains after the  Reserve Bank  said a rising currency is helping
contain inflation pressures, in minutes of its May 3 meeting
published today.  The Aussie dollar traded at $1.0561 as of 11:37 a.m. in
Sydney, from $1.0579 before the RBA minutes and $1.0556
yesterday in  New York . Inflation pressures may need to be slowed
“at some point” by higher  interest rates , the RBA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
