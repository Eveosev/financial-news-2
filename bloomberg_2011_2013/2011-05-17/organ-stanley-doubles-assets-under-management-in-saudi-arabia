Morgan Stanley (MS)  has doubled assets
under its management in  Saudi Arabia  this year as it seeks to
gain from economic growth in the world’s biggest oil exporter.  Morgan Stanley Investment Management is targeting 1 percent
market share of the kingdom’s investment funds valued at $85
billion, excluding sovereign wealth funds, Navtej Nandra, head
of international operations, said in an interview in Riyadh. The
regulator is opening up the market to attract foreign investment
and expand capital markets, he said.  Morgan Stanley Saudi Arabia, which was set up four years
ago in a joint venture with the Capital Group, began executing
swap transactions in August 2008 for non-resident foreign
investors. Saudi Arabia’s economy is the Arab world’s biggest
and its stock market is the largest in the Middle East by market
value. Saudi Arabia restricts direct foreign investments in its
capital markets.  “We see the Saudi economy expanding, a lot of stability, a
lot of diversification,” Nandra said today. “The kingdom is
critical for us in terms of investor base and investing
opportunities that are available to asset management companies.”  Saudi Arabia’s Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf said today
he expects economic growth to exceed that of 2010 and that an
International Monetary Fund forecast of 7.5 percent growth is
“optimistic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
