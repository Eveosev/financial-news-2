Uniloc USA Inc. lost its bid to have
an appeals court reinstate a $388 million patent damages award
from Microsoft Corp.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit  in
 Washington  D.C. yesterday  denied  Uniloc’s request.  “Unless either side seeks to appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court, the next step in this case is for the matter to be listed
for a retrial on damages,”  IMF Australia Ltd. (IMF) , an Australian
litigation funder, said today in a statement to the country’s
stock exchange.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, infringed a patent
on technology used to deter piracy, the appeals court had ruled
in January, overturning a U.S. District Judge’s decision to
throw out the 2009 verdict. The appeals court had ordered a
retrial on damages, saying the lower-court verdict of $388
million was “fundamentally tainted by the use of a legally
inadequate methodology.”  The award was the third-largest jury verdict in 2009 and
the second-biggest patent verdict, behind a $1.67 billion award
that Johnson & Johnson won against Abbott Laboratories,
according to Bloomberg data.  The case is Uniloc USA v.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , 10-1035,  U.S.
Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower
court case is Uniloc USA Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 03cv440, U.S.
District Court, District of Rhode Island (Providence).  To contact the reporter on this story:
