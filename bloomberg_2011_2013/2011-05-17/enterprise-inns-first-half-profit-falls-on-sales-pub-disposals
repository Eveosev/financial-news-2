Enterprise Inns Plc (ETI) , the U.K.’s
second-biggest pub owner, said first-half profit fell 13.4
percent as sales decreased and it reduced the number of pubs in
its portfolio.  Net income dropped to 71 million pounds ($115 million) in
the six months ended March 31 from 82 million pounds a year
earlier, the Solihull, England-based company said in a statement
today. Revenue fell 7.5  percent to 346 million pounds.  Enterprise’s profits have been hurt as consumers scrimp
amid government cuts and rising inflation as the U.K. emerges
from a recession. Freezing weather in December and cheap alcohol
at supermarkets also cut revenue. Sales of lager in pubs fell
7.5 percent last year the British Beer and Pub Association said
in January.  “The first half of this year has seen poor weather over
Christmas, consumers nervous about the economy and our publicans
challenged by a value added tax increase,” the company said in
today’s statement. “We expect trading conditions to remain
challenging.”  Enterprise, whose stock has fallen around 88 percent since
reaching a high of 774.5 pence per share in 2007, won’t pay a
dividend this year.  Enterprise, which is disposing of unprofitable sites, said
it sold 212 outlets together with other property assets for a
net 47 million pounds during the period. The company added that
it plans to sell about 500 pubs for the full year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
