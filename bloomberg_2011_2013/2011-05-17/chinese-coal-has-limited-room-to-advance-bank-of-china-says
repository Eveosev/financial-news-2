Lawrence Lau, an analyst with  Bank of
China International Holdings Ltd.  in  Hong Kong , comments on the
outlook for Chinese prices of thermal coal for power and coking
coal used to make steel. He wrote in a report dated today. Bank
of China International is a unit of Bank of China Ltd., the
country’s third-biggest lender by assets.  “Further upside in domestic spot thermal coal prices may
be limited given the poor profitability of thermal  power plants 
and the rising coal inventory.  “The deteriorating profitability of the coking plants and
the lower utilization of steel plants as a result of power
rationing could result in further weakness in coking-coal
prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
