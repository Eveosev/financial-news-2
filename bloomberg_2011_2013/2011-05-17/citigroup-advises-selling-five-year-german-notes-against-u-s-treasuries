Citigroup Inc. advised investors to
sell five-year German notes versus similar-maturity  U.S.
Treasuries , citing market expectations for European Central Bank
interest rates and government debt supply.  “The retracement in ECB policy rate expectations now looks
stretched and this week’s supply is likely to favor Treasuries
over the euro core,”Jamie Searle and Peter Goves, fixed-income
strategists in London, wrote today in a client report. While
Germany will sell five-year notes tomorrow, the  Federal Reserve 
is due to  buy back securities  “in the five-year area of the
curve,” they wrote.  Investors should bet that the additional yield for the
German securities widens to 75 basis points and end the trade if
it narrows to 56 basis points, the strategists wrote.  The yield spread was at 64 basis points as of 7:38 a.m. in
 London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
