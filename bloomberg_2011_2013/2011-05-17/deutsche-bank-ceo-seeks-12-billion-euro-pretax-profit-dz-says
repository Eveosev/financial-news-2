Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chief Executive
Officer Josef Ackermann is targeting pretax profit of 11 billion
euros ($15.6 billion) to 12 billion euros annually in the next
two to three years, a DZ Bank AG analyst said, citing a
roundtable with the manager yesterday evening.  The “main trigger” for the earnings growth will be the
private and business client unit including  Deutsche Postbank AG (DPB) ,
DZ Bank’s Matthias Duerr wrote in a note today. Ackermann
“seems to be very relaxed” about the potential impact of
lawsuits on the bank’s profit and reputation, the analyst said.  To fulfill potential additional capital requirements for
banks considered to be systemically important “we got the
impression that CoCos should be the main instrument,” Duerr
wrote. Contingent convertible bonds automatically become equity
when capital falls below preset levels.  Ronald Weichert , a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche
Bank, declined to comment on the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
