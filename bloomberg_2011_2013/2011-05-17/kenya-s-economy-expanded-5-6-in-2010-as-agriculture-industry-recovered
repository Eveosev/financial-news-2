Kenya ’s government cut its economic
growth forecast for 2011 to between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent,
as higher global food and fuel prices threaten to undermine
 consumer spending .  Growth in East Africa’s largest economy will slow from 5.6
percent in 2010, Planning Minister Wycliffe Oparanya said today
at an event in the capital, Nairobi. Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  forecast in March that the economy would expand 5.7
percent this year.  Risks to growth stem from “high international  oil prices ,
fluctuations in the  exchange rate , inadequate rainfall, which
has so far been insufficient, rising global food prices” and
the prospect of general elections in 2012, Oparanya said.  Kenya’s central bank cut its benchmark interest rate eight
times between December 2008 and January 2011 to help boost
growth. The bank’s monetary policy committee at its last
meeting, on March 22, unexpectedly increased the key lending
rate for the first time since June 2008, switching its emphasis
to easing price pressure from boosting the economy.  The move was also meant to stabilize Kenya’s shilling,
which has depreciated 6.8 percent against the dollar since the
start of year and was trading 0.27 percent weaker at 86.38
shillings by 1:43 p.m. in Nairobi, from yesterday’s close.  Price Pressures  A reduction in mobile-phone rates by telecommunications
companies, including  Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , East Africa’s biggest
mobile phone operator, and Delhi-based Bharti Airtel Ltd.,
helped slow average inflation to 4.1 percent last year, about
half of the average in 2009, Oparanya said.  This year, higher crude costs combined with rising
commodity prices have rekindled price pressure, he said.  Consumer-price growth in Kenya, which has remained above
the government’s 5 percent target for four consecutive months,
climbed to 12.05 percent in April from 9.19 percent in March.  Every industry in Kenya recorded growth last year, helping
to create 503,000 new jobs, as the agriculture industry
recovered following improved rains, Oparanya said. Kenya is the
world’s largest grower of black tea and also produces high-
quality and specialty coffee beans.  Agriculture, which accounts for a quarter of gross domestic
product, expanded 6.3 percent in 2010, compared with a
contraction of 2.6 percent in 2009, helped by better weather and
higher coffee and tea prices, Oparanya said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
