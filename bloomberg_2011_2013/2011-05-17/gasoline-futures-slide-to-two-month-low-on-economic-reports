Gasoline slipped to the lowest level
since March after reports that U.S. housing starts dropped and
industrial output growth stalled, indicating the U.S. economy
recovery may be slowing and fuel demand will decline.  Futures sank 1.8 percent as output at factories, mines and
utilities was unchanged after a 0.7 percent gain in March,
figures from the  Federal Reserve  showed. Work began on 523,000
houses, at an annual pace, down 11 percent from the prior month,
according to a Commerce Department report.  “Some of the worries about the economic situation seem to
be depressing the market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Gasoline for June delivery fell 5.24 cents to $2.8787 a
gallon at 10:12 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Prices
touched $2.8666, the lowest intraday level since March 17.
Gasoline has lost 17 percent since reaching $3.48 on April 29.  Building permits, a sign of future construction, fell 4
percent to a 551,000 annual pace in April. Manufacturing fell
0.4 percent.  The Energy Department reported on May 11 that gasoline
consumption dropped 1.3 percent in the week ended May 6 to a 12-
week low. On a four-week average, demand, measured by deliveries
to wholesalers, was 2.4 percent below a year earlier, wider than
the 1.9 percent deficit the prior week.  U.S. gasoline inventories probably rose a second
consecutive week in the period ended May 13, gaining 1 million
barrels, according to the median estimate of 13 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg News.  “There’s inventory pressure, too, because the market is
looking for builds again,” McGillian said.  Mississippi Floods  Futures also fell as concern lessened that Mississippi
River flooding would significantly disrupt refinery operations
in  Louisiana .  “The opening of the Morganza spillway over the weekend has
spared the worst of the flooding for the concentration of
refining assets near  Baton Rouge ,  New Orleans , and St.
Charles,” analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co., led by  Lawrence
Eagles  in New York, said in a report today.  “This has lowered the imminent threat of shutdowns at
refineries which collectively account for 15% of the US total
refining capacity,” Eagles said.  Regular retail gasoline dropped 1.1 cents to $3.944 a
gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website. It was the fifth
consecutive decline.  Stockpiles of distillates, including heating oil and
diesel, likely increased 500,000 barrels, according to the
survey.  Heating oil for June delivery dropped 2.39 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.8505 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
