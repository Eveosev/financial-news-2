Banque Privée Edmond de Rothschild
Europe said its Lisbon office was inspected by supervision and
judicial authorities yesterday as part of an inquiry directed at
two former clients of the wealth manager.  A government prosecutor directed the investigation, which
involves two clients, and not the bank itself, the Portuguese
Attorney General’s Office said today in an e-mailed statement.
It didn’t specify if they were current or former clients.
Materials were seized as part of the search, the office said.  The bank provided all the “legally required” cooperation,
Edmond de Rothschild said in its own statement. The company said
its business continues “in full normality.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
