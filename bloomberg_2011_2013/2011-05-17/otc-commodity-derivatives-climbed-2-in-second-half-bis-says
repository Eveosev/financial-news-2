Trading of commodity derivatives off
exchanges rose 2 percent in the last six months of 2010 on gains
in forwards and swaps contracts on precious metals, according to
the  Bank for International Settlements .  Over-the-counter commodity contracts were worth $2.92
trillion at the end of December, up from $2.85 trillion six
months earlier, according to a BIS report published today. The
contractsâ€™ value slipped from the year-earlier $2.94 trillion.
Raw materials as tracked by the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index rose
29 percent in the period.  Metals, energy and agricultural contracts made up 0.5
percent of the total $601 trillion of over-the-counter
derivatives traded worldwide in the half, the Basel,
Switzerland-based BIS said.  Derivatives are financial instruments whose performance is
derived from those of stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and
commodities, or linked to specific events such as changes in
weather.  Trading of commodities forwards and swaps, non-standardized
types of derivatives, advanced to $1.78 trillion from $1.55
trillion six months earlier.  Raw-materials  options, contracts
that give holders the right to buy or sell products at fixed
prices and specified times with no obligation to do so, fell to
$744 billion from $883 billion, the bank said.  Off-exchange gold derivatives dropped to $396 billion at
the end of 2010 from $417 billion in the first half, according
to the BIS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
