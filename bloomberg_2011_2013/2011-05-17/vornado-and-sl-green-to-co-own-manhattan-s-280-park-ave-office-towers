Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)  and  SL Green
Realty Corp. (SLG) , rival New York office landlords, said they gained
a “significant majority” stake in 280 Park Ave., a pair of
connected midtown Manhattan office towers.  The two real estate investment trusts merged their debt and
equity positions to form a new ownership structure for the 1.2
million-square-foot (111,000-square-meter) property, they said
in a joint statement. Scott Lawlor’s Broadway Partners, which
co-owned the building with  Investcorp Bank BSC (INVCORP) , is adding
capital and will keep an ownership interest, the companies said.  Investors across the U.S. have been buying debt as a way to
gain control of distressed properties. SL Green and Vornado in
March formed a joint venture to hold about $400 million of high-
interest mezzanine loans on 280 Park Ave. The deal put the REITs
in a position to become co-owners of the building, according to
Michael Knott, an analyst at Green Street Advisors Inc. in
 Newport Beach ,  California .  “Given rising asset values and recovering fundamentals in
midtown Manhattan, making a power play on a lease-up situation
located along one of the world’s great office addresses makes
ample sense,” Knott said in a note to clients in March.  The partners said they created a $150 million fund to
reposition and find new tenants for the tower. Deutsche Bank AG
was scheduled to vacate more than 330,000 square feet in the
building in February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
