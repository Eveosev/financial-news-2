The Czech Ministry of Industry and
Trade established a committee to analyze fees banks in the Czech
Republic charge clients,  Aktualne  reported, citing the Deputy
Minister Bedrich Danda.  The committee aims to determine what proportion of profit
these banks make on fees and compare them with fees charged in
countries where their owners are present or major lenders in the
euro area, the web site said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
