VCI, the main association of German
chemical companies, raised its forecast for production, sales
and prices this year in the industry, paced by demand abroad.  Chemical production is expected to gain 5 percent, while
sales will probably increase 9 percent in 2011, VCI said in an
e-mailed statement today. Thatâ€™s up from a March forecast for a
2.5 percent gain in production and a 4 percent rise in sales.
Prices will probably climb 4 percent instead of an original
prediction of 1.5 percent, it said.  Chemical sales in the first quarter jumped 8.4 percent from
the fourth quarter of last year to 45.2 billion euros ($64
billion), the group said. Production increased 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
