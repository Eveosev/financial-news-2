Five people were killed following a
raid by hundreds of people on African Barrick Gold Plc’s North
Mara mine in  Tanzania , Reuters reported, citing regional police
commander Constantine Massawe.  Between 800 and 1,200 armed people invaded the mine at 5
a.m. local time yesterday to steal gold ore from the crushers,
Reuters cited Massawe as saying. Operations at the mine were
temporarily suspended during the raid before production resumed,
according to the report.  African Barrick spokesman Charles Chichester couldn’t
immediately comment when contacted in  London  by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
