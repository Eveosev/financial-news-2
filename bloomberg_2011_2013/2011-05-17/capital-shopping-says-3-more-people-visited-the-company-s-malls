Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc (CSCG) ,
the U.K.’s biggest shopping-mall owner, said 3 percent more
people have visited its retail properties this year.  Occupancy at Capital Shopping’s 14 malls is 96.8 percent,
down from the 97.7 percent reported at the end of December, the
London-based company said in a statement today. The integration
of the Trafford Centre near Manchester,  England , has been
completed and the mall has “performed strongly,” Capital
Shopping said.  Capital Shopping’s shareholders approved the purchase of
the Trafford Centre in January for 748 million pounds ($1.2
billion), the highest price ever paid for a British property.  “We continue to expect 2011 to be a difficult year for
consumers, but CSC’s overall performance for the year to date
has been in line with expectations, with progress on lettings to
improve the overall tenant mix and in its active management and
investment plans,” Chief Executive Officer David Fischel said
in the statement.  Capital Shopping signed 36 new leases during the period,
adding 2 million pounds to the company’s annual rent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
