State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s
largest lender, plunged in Mumbai trading after fourth-quarter
profit dropped 99 percent to the lowest in at least 10 years as
it set aside more funds for bad loans.  The shares declined 7.7 percent to 2,414.7 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, the most in almost two years. Net
income dropped to 208.8 million rupees ($4.6 million) for the
three months ended March 31, from 18.7 billion rupees a year
earlier, the bank said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange
today. That compared with the 30.8 billion rupee average of 27
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chairman Pratip Chaudhuri, who took the helm at the state-
owned company last month, said lending this year may be
restricted following nine interest rate increases by the central
bank since March 2010. Higher-than expected provisioning could
make the lender better positioned to tackle slowing credit
growth in an economy forecast by the government to grow at about
8 percent in the year to March 31, from 8.6 percent in the
previous period.  “This basically is the new management saying let’s clean
things up and start afresh,”  Brian Hunsaker , an analyst at
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in a phone interview today from
 Hong Kong . “This wasn’t the base-case expectation of the
market. It wasn’t communicated well at all that this was coming,
that’s why the stock is reacting this way.”  Coverage Ratio  State Bank  increased provisions for bad loans and other
contingencies by 77 percent to 41.6 billion rupees, according to
its statement. The coverage ratio widened to 64.95 percent as of
March 31, from 64.1 percent on Dec. 31. One-off provisions on
gratuities and pensions contributed to the jump, Chaudhuri said.  The lender will need to set aside another 11 billion rupees
over the next two quarters to meet the  Reserve Bank  of India’s
provisioning rules, Chaudhuri said.  The central bank has increased  interest rates  nine times
since March 2010 to tame inflation that was 8.7 percent in
April.  “Credit growth for this year should be in line” with the
Reserve Bank of  India ’s guidance of 18 percent, Chief Financial
Officer Diwakar Gupta told media in the eastern Indian city of
Kolkata today. Growth will moderate by up to 3 percent from last
year’s levels, said Gupta, who assumed his role in April.  Rights Offer  Chaudhuri declined to provide a timeline on State Bank’s
plans to raise 200 billion rupees from a rights offer, saying it
was a “work in progress.” The government may delay the sale
until it finds the money to invest and maintain its 59.4 percent
stake, former Banking Secretary R. Gopalan had said in January.  State Bank’s capital adequacy ratio under the so-called
Basel II norms shrank to 11.98 percent during the quarter from
13.39 percent a year earlier. That compares with 19.54 percent
at  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the nation’s largest private-sector lender,
and 12.42 percent at Punjab National Bank, the No. 2 state-owned
lender in India.  “Management is going to have to explain what’s going on
and their strategy for the future,” Hunsaker said. “Credit
quality ratios don’t look very good.”  Loans climbed by 20 percent to 7.72 trillion rupees as of
March 31, from 6.4 trillion rupees a year earlier, State Bank
said. Deposits rose 16 percent to 9.34 trillion rupees. Bad
loans dropped to 1.63 percent of total advances in the quarter
from 1.72 percent a year earlier, it said.  Net interest income, or revenue from borrowers after
deducting interest paid to depositors, climbed 20 percent to
80.6 billion rupees from 67.2 billion rupees a year earlier. Net
interest margin, a measure of lending profitability, widened to
3.32 percent from 2.66 percent in March 2010.  Non-interest income, which includes fees tied to debit
cards as well as income from distribution of mutual funds and
insurance products, climbed 6.8 percent to 48.2 billion rupees.  The stock’s rout today extends its decline for the year to
14 percent, compared with a 12 percent decline in India’s
benchmark Sensitive Index and 9 percent retreat by India’s 14-
stock Bankex Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
