Vaibhav Agrawal, an analyst at Angel
Broking Ltd., comments on  State Bank of India (SBIN)  after  India ’s
largest lender by assets said fourth-quarter profit plunged 99
percent. Agrawal spoke in a phone interview from Mumbai.  State Bank  sank 6.4 percent to 2,449.75 rupees as of 1:56
p.m. in Mumbai, set for the steepest decline since July 2009,
after reporting net income of 208.8 million rupees ($4.6
million), the lowest in at least 10 years, as provisions
climbed. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
fell 1.3 percent to 18,113.42.  “They have tried to provide as much as they can for all
the requirements in this quarter itself, and that has depressed
profits. Net interest margins have also come down 40 to 50 basis
points this quarter compared with the previous quarter, which is
also a very sharp decline.” A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  “There is a leverage on other expenses as well. Staff and
tax costs have almost doubled, more than what we expected,
further denting profit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
