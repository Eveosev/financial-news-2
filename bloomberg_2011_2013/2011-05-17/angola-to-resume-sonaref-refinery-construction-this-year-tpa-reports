Angola will resume the construction
of its Sonaref oil refinery in the port city of Lobito this
year, Televisao Publico de Angola said, citing Manuel Vicente,
the chairman of Sonangol Holdings, the state oil company.  The project, which will have the capacity to refine 200,000
barrels of oil a day, was delayed earlier this year to review
its cost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
