Peter Wong,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s
chief executive officer for Asia Pacific, comments on inflation
in Asia, dollar borrowing and the  Hong Kong  mortgage market.  HSBC, the U.K. bank that made more than half of its profit
in Asia last year, aims to add at least 2,000 employees in China
and Singapore in the next five years to target wealthy
individuals in the region. Wong spoke in an interview yesterday
in Hong Kong.  On Asia inflation:  “When you talk about Asia, there is some inflation in
terms of assets. India is already increasing  interest rates .
China is already increasing interest rates. Singapore is using
the currency for controlling inflation and Australia is also
increasing interest rates. What’s good about it is the
governments are realizing the inflationary issues and therefore
they are dealing with it.”  On  U.S. dollar ’s impact on inflation:  “Do I see inflationary pressure continuing? As long as the
U.S. currency continues to weaken and the U.S. continues to have
a very low interest-rate scenario, there will be people who want
to borrow in U.S. dollar and invest in high appreciating
assets.”  On the Hong Kong mortgage market  “What’s happened in the past couple of years is that there
were so much borrowings of a low-yielding currency with such low
interest rates and investing in high-yielding assets. Everybody
is doing that, so there is a little bit of tightness in terms of
liquidity in the market.”
