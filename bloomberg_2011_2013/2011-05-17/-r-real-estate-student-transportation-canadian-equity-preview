Canadian stocks rose for a third day
as oil gained after a government report showed a decline in U.S.
supplies and base metals advanced on speculation demand from
 China  will increase.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-
largest energy company by market value, gained 2.5 percent after
a rating increase by Menno Hulshof, an analyst at Toronto-
Dominion bank. Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., which has a copper and gold
project in  Mongolia  with Rio Tinto Group, rose 7.2 percent as
copper gained for a fifth day. BlackBerry maker  Research In

points, or 1.2 percent, to 13,607.25, erasing its loss for the
year.  “Commodities have come down to the point where some are
looking relatively cheap,” said Blair Falconer, who oversees
C$800 million ($822 million) as a  money manager  at HSBC
Securities ( Canada ) Inc. in Toronto. “Energy, for example, is
looking a lot better than it did a short while ago.”  The index increased 0.5 percent this week through
yesterday, narrowing its quarterly loss to 4.8 percent, as raw-
materials companies climbed on rebounding copper, corn and wheat
prices. The materials industry accounts for 21 percent of
Canadian stocks by market value, according to Bloomberg data.  Crude futures rose 3.3 percent after the U.S. Energy
Department said oil inventories fell last week. Most analysts in
a Bloomberg survey had forecast an increase.  Suncor Rises  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,

country’s fifth-biggest energy company, increased 3.5 percent to

producer, climbed 4.3 percent to C$25.09 after reporting first-
quarter cash flow that beat the average analyst estimate.  Canadian Natural gained 2.5 percent to C$40.74 after
Hulshof raised his rating on the stock to “action list buy”
from “buy.” In a note to clients, Hulshof cited the company’s
growing oil-sands resources and forecasts of higher processing-
equipment reliability.  Sterling Resources Ltd. (SLG) , which explores for oil and gas in
 Europe , plunged 29 percent to C$1.78 after encountering wet
sands in North Sea drilling. The shares have tumbled 54 percent
since April 28, when the company declared force majeure on its
Romanian offshore blocks due to trouble getting government
permits.  Oilfield-services provider  North American Energy Partners
Inc. (NOA)  sank 26 percent to C$7.39. The company said it will take a
writedown of C$40 million to C$45 million due to the impact of
inflation at the Horizon oil-sands project.  China Housing  Base-metals and coal producers gained after China’s
statistics bureau said  home prices  advanced in 67 of 70 cities
in April from last year. Copper demand from Chinese cable makers

percent, the most since October 2008, to C$5.14 after its first-
quarter earnings beat the average analyst estimate.  Wet Weather  Fertilizer producers climbed as wet weather delayed corn
and wheat planting in the U.S. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan

rose 2.3 percent to C$53.49.  Agrium Inc. (AGU)  gained 2.1 percent to
C$79.67.  RIM advanced for a second day after falling to a four-year
low May 16, rallying 3.8 percent to C$44.11.  Pierre Ferragu , a
Bernstein analyst, raised his rating on the shares to “market
perform, telling clients in a note, ‘‘We do not see RIM’s
situation deteriorating fast enough in the next 12 months to
frighten the market beyond today’s negative sentiment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
