UACN Property Development Co., which
provides accommodation for corporations in  Nigeria , rose the
most in a week after saying it will pay dividend for the 2010
full year.  The stock climbed 60 kobo, or 3.7 percent, to 17 naira by
12:10 p.m. in Lagos. That’s biggest intraday gain since May 10.  The company will pay a dividend of 55 kobo per share for
the 12 months through December, it said in a statement published
in the Punch newspaper today.  “The dividend is good, and that’s what investors are
responding to,” Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of
Lagos-based brokerage Kundila Finance, said by phone.  UACN Property Development’s shares have risen 3 percent
this year, compared with an increase of 4.1 percent in the
 Nigerian Stock Exchange ’s All-Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
