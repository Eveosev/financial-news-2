Colombian textile makers fell after
the Obama administration threatened to stall the final passage
of a free-trade agreement with  Colombia  unless Congress extends
retraining assistance for U.S. workers who lose jobs to foreign
competition.  Enka de Colombia SA, a Medellin-based synthetic fibers
producer, dropped 4.3 percent to 13.40 pesos at 1:19 p.m. New
York time, headed for the biggest fall in six months on a
closing basis. Textiles Fabricato SA, Colombia’s biggest textile
maker, dropped 2 percent to 50 pesos, its lowest price in a
week.  Pending U.S. free-trade accords with South Korea, Colombia
and Panama won’t be submitted to Congress until lawmakers agree
to renew trade-adjustment assistance for workers, National
Economic Council Director Gene Sperling said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
