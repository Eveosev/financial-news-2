What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open up 5 cents to 6 cents a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that yields
will decline as wet weather delays U.S. planting, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on the slow pace of sowing in the U.S., Gerlach said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.2 cent a pound
higher, and soybean-meal futures may open up $1 per 2,000
pounds, he said.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent a bushel higher on the CBOT,
the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange , as rain hampers spring seeding in Canada and the
northern U.S., while drought hurts crops in the southern Great
Plains, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
