Stork BV, which makes fuselage parts
for jets, got 105 million pounds ($170 million) of senior
leveraged loans to back its buyout of RBG Ltd.  The financing includes 75 million pounds of five and six-
year term loans, according to a statement from underwriter
Rabobank International. The deal also includes an undisclosed
amount of pay-in-kind debt, which allows borrowers to pay
interest with more debt instead of cash.  Storkâ€™s technical services unit and Arle Capital LLP agreed
to buy RBG for an undisclosed amount, the companies said in a
statement yesterday. The Aberdeen-based company provides
inspection, assessment and repair services to the  energy
industry . It generated 300 million pounds of sales last year.  Lloyds Corporate Markets joined as a mandated lead arranger
in the senior facilities, Rabobank said.  Details of the senior financing are as follows:  To contact the reporter on this story:
