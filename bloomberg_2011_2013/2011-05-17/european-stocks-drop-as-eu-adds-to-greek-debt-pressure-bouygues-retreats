European stocks retreated for a
fourth day as officials increased pressure on  Greece  to sell
assets and deepen spending cuts to secure a bigger bailout. U.S.
futures were little changed.  Bouygues SA dropped 2.5 percent after reporting a slump in
profit. Vodafone Group Plc gained 1.4 percent after posting
increased earnings.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
279.73 at 8:04 a.m. in  London , dropping a fourth day for the
longest losing streak in two months. The gauge has retreated for
two straight weeks as a selloff in commodity producers and
renewed sovereign-debt concern in the euro area outweighed
company profits that topped analystsâ€™ estimates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
