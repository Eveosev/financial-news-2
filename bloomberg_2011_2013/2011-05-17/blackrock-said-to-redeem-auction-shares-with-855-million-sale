BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
money manager, said seven of its closed-end funds raised $855
million so they can provide liquidity to investors whose money
was frozen since the collapse of the auction-rate market in
February 2008.  The BlackRock funds raised the money in a private placement
of so-called variable-rate demand preferred shares, according to
a statement today from the New York-based company. The money
will be used to buy back preferred shares that investors
couldn’t sell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
