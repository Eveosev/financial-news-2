Apache Corp. (APA) , the largest U.S.
independent oil and natural-gas producer by market value, will
increase  capital spending  8.3 percent to $8.12 billion this year
as it develops assets it bought in 2010.  The new  capital budget  is an increase from the $7.5 billion
it said last month it planned to spend, as it seeks to tap some
of the $11 billion worth of projects it acquired last year,
according to  slides  posted for an investor meeting today in New
York.  Apache, based in Houston, has the inventory to achieve
annual production growth of 6 percent to 12 percent from 2012 to
2015. The company may spend an average of $8 billion to $10
billion per year during that time, with another $1 billion a
year going to liquefied natural gas projects, according to the
slides.  “After a year of significant acquisitions, now they’re
moving into a growth mode and the growth outlook is very strong
into the middle of the decade,” said Brian Youngberg, an
analyst with  Edward Jones  in  St. Louis  who has a “buy” rating
on Apache shares and owns none.  Apache’s 2010 acquisitions included Mariner Energy Inc. and
assets from BP Plc and  Devon Energy Corp. (DVN)  Apache has said it
expects production growth of 13 percent to 17 percent in 2011,
excluding potential sales or purchases.  Chief Executive Officer Steven Farris told investors today
that commodity prices will help determine Apache’s future plans.
He said rates of return, and not growth, will guide the
company’s decisions.  ‘Under-Promise’  Apache fell 84 cents to $121.43 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading as oil futures fell to the
lowest price in almost three months. The stock has climbed 1.9
percent this year, after rising 16 percent in 2010.  Youngberg said some investors may have expected even higher
capital spending or production growth. Companies “prefer to
under-promise and over-deliver,” he said.  Oil futures traded in  New York  averaged $94.60 a barrel in
the first quarter, a 20 percent increase from a year earlier.
The commodity also has traded at more than $100 a barrel for
much of the current quarter.  Apache said today that its 2011 Canadian spending will
climb 48 percent from an earlier forecast to $1.18 billion. U.S.
spending will rise 7.6 percent from the initial guidance to
$3.39 billion this year. That includes an increase in such areas
as the Permian and central U.S., as well as an $80 million
decline in deep-water Gulf of Mexico spending.  Independent oil and gas companies such as Apache don’t own
refining, chemical or retail fuel businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
