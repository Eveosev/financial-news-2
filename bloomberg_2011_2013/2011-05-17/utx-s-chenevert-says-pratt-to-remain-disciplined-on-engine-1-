United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  Chief
Executive Officer Louis Chenevert said the Pratt & Whitney unit
will stay “disciplined” in competition for large commercial
 jet engines  that vie against its geared turbofan design  “I would say I never underestimate the competition, but I
am confident in what we’ve done,” Chenevert said during a
presentation to investors at the Electrical Products Group
conference in Longboat Key, Florida today.  Since announcing plans for the upgraded A320 single-aisle
aircraft, Toulouse, France-based Airbus SAS has won orders from
carriers including Deutsche Lufthansa AG and IndiGo of  India .
Pratt has secured orders from three customers to install engines
on the A320neo, which also comes with the Leap-X variant by the
CFM International joint venture run by General Electric Co. and
Safran SA of  France .  “We’re going to see continued good traction,” Chenevert
said. “We will remain disciplined. There’s going to be
campaigns where maybe people will do crazy things. I think we
have to stay disciplined. You can never overcome the technology
advantage by just throwing money at something.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
