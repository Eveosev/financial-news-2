Joint-Stock Bank for  Foreign Trade  of
Vietnam, the country’s third-biggest bank by assets, said it is
reviving plans to sell as much as a 20 percent stake to overseas
investors.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  will advise on the sale planned for
next year, Vietcombank Chairman Nguyen Hoa Binh said by phone
today. State-controlled Vietcombank, as the Hanoi-based lender
is known, first sold shares to outside investors in 2007 before
listing on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange two years later.  The company in 2007 said it was seeking a “foreign
strategic investor,” before the plans were derailed by
discussions over price and then by the global economic crisis.
Reviving the sale may test investor appetite for Vietnam amid
rising inflation and declining foreign reserves.  “The global crisis is behind us but the question now is
regarding Vietnam: high inflation, unattractive  interest rates 
that are hurting demand for credit, a stock market that isn’t
doing well, slowing growth,” said Lawrence Wolfe, director of
business development at DongA Securities in  Ho Chi Minh City .
“I’m not sure whether foreign investors will have the stomach
for that unless they really have a long-term vision.”  Vietcombank reported total assets as of the end of 2010 of
307.5 trillion dong ($14.9 billion), and net profit of 4.2
trillion dong. Its shares today jumped 4.8 percent to 30,900
dong.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
