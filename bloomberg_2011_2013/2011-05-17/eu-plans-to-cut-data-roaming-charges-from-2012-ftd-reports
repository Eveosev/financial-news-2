Neelie Kroes, the European
Commissioner in charge of the European Unionâ€™s digital agenda,
plans to reduce the roaming charges companies such as  Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  Telefonica SA (TEF)  may charge for
data traffic from 2012, the  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported.  The maximum net charges would be cut from 2.50 euros per
megabyte at present to 90 cents from mid-2012 and to 50 cents
from 2014, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people at the
European Commission. The plan, to be revealed on June 22, will
also call for roaming fees for calls and short messages to be
reduced, according to the FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
