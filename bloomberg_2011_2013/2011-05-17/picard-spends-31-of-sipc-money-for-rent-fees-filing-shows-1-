Irving Picard , the trustee
liquidating the estate of convicted Ponzi scheme mastermind
Bernard L. Madoff, has received more than $1.1 billion from the
Securities Investor Protection Corp. and used 31 percent of the
amount for fees, rent and other expenses.  Some $346.3 million of the money advanced by SIPC through
March was consumed by administrative expenses, while about
$779.3 million was used to pay customer claims, Picard said in a
court filing yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  Manhattan .
Expenses included rent for Madoff’s former office in Manhattan,
the trustee’s monthly fees and record-keeping, he said.  Picard included the numbers in an interim report for the
period from Oct. 1 through March 31. During that time, he filed
more than 1,000 lawsuits to try to recover more than $90 billion
for the Madoff estate, he said.  Cumulative fees paid to Picard since Madoff’s 2008 arrest
were $3.6 million. His law firm, Baker & Hostetler LLP, received
$145.6 million.  Earlier this month, Picard said he would allocate
$2.6 billion of money recovered through settlements and suits to
a fund for investors who lost money in the scheme, paying an
initial $272 million to those with approved claims.  The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
