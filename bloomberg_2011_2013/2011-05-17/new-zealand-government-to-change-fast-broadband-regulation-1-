New Zealand  is changing its approach
to regulation of prices charged by its partners in a high-speed
broadband project to ensure customers don’t pay too much during
construction of the network.  The government will have contractual clauses that allow for
oversight of prices, Communications Minister Steven Joyce said
in an e-mailed statement. The mechanisms would be triggered if
significant changes are made to prices over the building period,
he said.  The government is in talks with Telecom Corp. and other
providers to partner in a NZ$1.5 billion ($1.2 billion) project
to deliver fast Internet services to homes and businesses. The
charges customers will pay are part of the talks, and an initial
plan to have no regulatory oversight of the prices during the
building phase has been criticized.  “While I think that concerns are more theoretical than
real, we have been able to find an alternative solution that
will give the infrastructure builders confidence to stay
committed to their low capped prices and customers confidence
that they will continue to get the best prices,” Joyce said.  The contractual mechanism may include repayment of funding
to the government, he said.  “In making this change, the government is backing the
prices negotiated,” Joyce said. “However if the Commerce
Commission believes prices should go lower at some point over
the build period, government wears the risk, not consumers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
