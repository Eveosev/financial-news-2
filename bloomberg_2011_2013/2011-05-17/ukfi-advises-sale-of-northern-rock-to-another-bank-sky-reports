U.K. Financial Investments Ltd.,  the
body that manages the governmentâ€™s ownership of Northern Rock
Plc, has recommended an outright sale of Northern Rock to
another bank or building society rather than transforming the
bank into a privately-held lender, Sky News reported, without
saying where it got the information. The sale process will begin
as soon as possible, Sky said, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
