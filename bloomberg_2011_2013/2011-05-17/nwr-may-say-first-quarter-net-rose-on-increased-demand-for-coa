New World Resources Plc, the biggest
Czech coking-coal supplier, may post first-quarter net profit
tomorrow as an improving economy spurs demand from steelmakers
and utilities and commodity prices rose.  Net income in the three months through March 31 probably
reached 18 million euros ($26 million), compared with a 14.5
million-euro loss a year earlier, according to the average
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Amsterdam-registered company may say earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose 55 percent to
88.7 million euros while revenue probably rose 17 percent to 385
million euros, the survey shows. NWR announced last month it
negotiated a 35 percent increase in contract prices for coking
coal deliveries in the second quarter.  The company is scheduled to release earnings tomorrow
before the stock market opens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
