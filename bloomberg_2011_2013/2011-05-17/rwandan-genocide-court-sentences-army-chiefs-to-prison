The International Tribunal for  Rwanda 
found two former military chiefs guilty of crimes in connection
with the 1994 genocide in which 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and
sympathetic Hutus were massacred in 100 days.  Former chief of staff of the Rwandan Army, Augustin
Bizimungu, accused of helping to plan and execute the genocide
in the early 1990s, was sentenced to 30 years in prison by the
Arusha, Tanzania-based court today.  Augustin Ndindiliyimana, former head of the Gendarmerie
Nationale, a military force in charge of public safety, was
sentenced to 11 years in prison for genocide, according to the
ruling. He was released immediately because his time had already
been served, the Rwandan government said.  “The question is whether, in fact, there was any
mitigating factors for which the convicts escaped the highest
sentence,” Rwanda’s chief prosecutor, Martin Ngoga, said in a
mobile-phone text message to reporters from the Rwandan capital,
Kigali. “Ndindiliyimana’s short prison term is one case where
the tribunal, as in past occasions, doesn’t meet the
expectations and anticipations of the many on the ground.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
