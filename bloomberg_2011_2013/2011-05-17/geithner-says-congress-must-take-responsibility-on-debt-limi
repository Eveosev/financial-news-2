Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said Congress must “meet its responsibility” to
increase the federal debt limit.  The debt ceiling “relates only to commitments we have made
in the past,” Geithner said in remarks prepared for a speech to
the Harvard Club in  New York  today. “Rather than debating
whether we should pay our past bills and whether default would
in fact be so bad; rather than designing schemes to allow us to
continue to make interest payments by breaking our commitments
to seniors and veterans; we should be working together to narrow
our differences on how to solve the causes of future deficits.”  The U.S. was $25 million under the $14.294 trillion debt
limit as of yesterday, according to Treasury data released
today. Geithner said yesterday he had taken measures to stay
below the limit until Aug. 2.  Geithner wrote lawmakers to say he declared a “debt
issuance suspension period,” which allows him to free up
borrowing room from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability
Fund and the Government Securities Investment Fund. The steps,
widely expected as Republicans and Democrats argue over, when
and how to raise the debt limit, won’t affect retirees or
government operations.  Geithner reiterated today that if an agreement isn’t
reached by Aug. 2 “the debt limit must still be increased. It
simply is not an option for Congress to evade the basic
responsibility to protect America’s creditworthiness.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
