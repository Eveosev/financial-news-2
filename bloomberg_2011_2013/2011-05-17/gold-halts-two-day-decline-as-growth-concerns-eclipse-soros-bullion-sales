Gold may gain for the first time in
three days in New York as physical buying and concern about
Europe’s debt boosts demand for the metal.  European finance officials endorsed a bailout for Portugal
as Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said the
region’s ministers floated the idea of extending Greece’s debt-
repayment schedule. Billionaire investor  George Soros  sold 99
percent of his bullion-backed SPDR Gold Trust assets and all 5
million shares in the iShares Gold Trust, a filing showed.
Hedge-fund manager  John Paulson  kept his SPDR Gold Trust stake.  “There’s still a lot of uncertainty in the euro zone” and
some physical buyers consider the price “relatively cheap,”
said Bernard Sin, the head of currency and metal trading at MKS
Finance SA, a bullion refiner in Geneva. “It’s a trading market
and it’s no surprise that big investors liquidated positions.
They may reinstate positions at a certain point and it doesn’t
necessarily mean that others are going to follow.”  Gold for June delivery rose $2.20, or 0.1 percent, to
$1,492.80 an ounce by 7:59 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Immediate-delivery gold was 0.3 percent higher at $1,493.05 in
 London .  Bullion fell to $1,495.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,500.75 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.
Accelerating inflation,  Europe ’s debt crisis, a weakening dollar
and fighting in Libya boosted gold to a record $1,577.40 on May
2. Prices are up 5 percent in 2011 after climbing the past 10
years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades.  U.K. Inflation  U.K. inflation accelerated more than economists forecast in
April to the fastest since October 2008, data today showed. Bank
of England Governor  Mervyn King  said inflation is likely to rise
further in the next few months.  Soros Fund Management LLC’s SPDR Gold Trust holding was
worth $6.9 million as of March 31, the filing showed, compared
with $655 million Dec. 31. He also cut stakes in  NovaGold
Resources Inc. (NG)  and  Kinross Gold Corp. (K)   “Soros was sitting on a huge profit and like a lot of
investors of late, he was happy to take those profits off the
table,” said  Gavin Wendt , founding director at MineLife Pty in
Sydney. “That shouldn’t surprise people. Gold has been rising
for a decade for fundamental reasons, which haven’t gone away.”  Paulson & Co. maintained 31.5 million shares in the SPDR
Gold Trust, a filing showed yesterday. Touradji Capital
Management LP, founded by Paul Touradji, sold all of its 173,000
shares in the SPDR Gold Trust during the first quarter, the
company said in a filing last week. Eric Mindich’s Eton Park
Capital Management LP cut its stake in the exchange-traded
product by 48 percent during the first quarter, a filing showed
yesterday.  Silver for July delivery fell 0.2 percent to $34.075 an
ounce in  New York . Palladium for June delivery was up 0.4
percent at $716.65 an ounce. Platinum for July delivery gained
0.7 percent to $1,773 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
