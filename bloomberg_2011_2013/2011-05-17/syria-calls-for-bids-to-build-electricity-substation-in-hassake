Syria â€™s Public Establishment of
Electricity for Generation and Transmission invited companies to
bid for the design and construction of an indoor substation.  Companies can submit bids until July 4 for the contract to
build the substation in Al-Swedieh in the eastern Hassakeh
province, the state-owned establishment said on its  website .  Syria passed an energy law on Nov. 14 allowing foreign and
private local investors to generate and distribute electricity.
The law still awaits executive approval to come into effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
