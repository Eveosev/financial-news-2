The gross market value of over-the-
counter derivatives tied to the Swiss franc jumped 55 percent in
the second half of last year as the currency rose to a record
against the euro, the  Bank for International Settlements  said.  The gross value of all currency derivatives, used as a
measure of risk, and defined as the outstanding profits and
losses on the contracts, was little changed from the first half
as the value of instruments tied to the euro fell, the Basel,
Switzerland-based BIS said in an e-mailed report. The value of
the underlying products on which the derivatives are based, the
notional value, increased by 9 percent, the bank said.  The Swiss franc rose 19 percent against the euro last year
and climbed 11 percent versus the dollar as the  Swiss National
Bank  relented on efforts to stem the currency’s appreciation
amid investor demand for a refuge from  Europe ’s debt crisis. The
franc advanced to a record 1.24025 per euro on Dec. 30, and rose
to an all-time high of 85.54 centimes per dollar on May 4.  The franc weakened 0.2 percent to 1.2558 against the euro
as of 11:13 a.m. in  London  today. It was little changed at 88.09
centimes per dollar.  The gross market value of over-the-counter derivatives tied
to the franc doubled in the first half of 2010, the BIS said.  The value of all derivatives covered by the BIS report
dropped 14 percent as the value of interest-rate contracts
tumbled 17 percent, it said. The drop may reflect “the
convergence of interest-rate expectations with the  interest
rates  locked into contracts,” the BIS said.  Notional amounts outstanding for interest-rate derivatives
increased by 3 percent due to exchange-rate effects because all
values are reported in dollars, according to the BIS.  The report covers derivatives traded over-the-counter and
not on exchanges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
