Fairpoint Communications Inc., a
provider of Internet and phone services plunged the most since
emerging from bankruptcy this year, after saying it’s
“unlikely” to achieve its revenue forecast.  Fairpoint dropped $6.48, or 40 percent, to $9.59 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based company has declined 61 percent since Jan.
26, when the shares were relisted.  In March, Fairpoint had projected full-year sales of $1.06
billion to $1.09 billion. Fairpoint won’t give a new revenue
forecast, according to a statement yesterday. The company also
reported results for its first full quarter since emerging from
bankruptcy in January.  Fairpoint filed for Chapter 11 protection in October,
citing competition for customers and interest payments on debt.
The company completed a restructuring plan that lowered debt --
much of which came from buying landlines from  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  -- and replaced the board and members of
management.  Fixed-line phone companies are losing subscribers
industrywide as customers switch to mobile phones or digital
voice service offered by cable companies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
