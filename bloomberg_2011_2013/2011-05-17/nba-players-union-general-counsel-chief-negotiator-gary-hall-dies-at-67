Gary Hall, the lead attorney at
the  National Basketball Association ’s players union, died
yesterday. He was 67.  The death appeared to be of natural causes, said
Robert Gadson, the association’s director of security and
agent administration.  Hall, who joined the National Basketball Players
Association in 2005, would have played a significant role
in negotiations aimed at reaching a new collective
bargaining agreement. The league’s labor contract with its
players expires on June 30.  “Gary worked tirelessly to build the NBPA and to
champion the rights of its players,” NBA Commissioner
David Stern said in an e-mailed statement. “Gary
contributed greatly to the growth of basketball and the NBA
on a global basis.”  Prior to joining the union, Hall was a partner in the
Syracuse,  New York , law firm Blitman & King, where he
specialized in labor matters.  “He had the ability to communicate with any type of
person in any position,” Jim LaVaute, managing partner at
Blitman & King, said in a telephone interview. “He was of
the highest character.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
