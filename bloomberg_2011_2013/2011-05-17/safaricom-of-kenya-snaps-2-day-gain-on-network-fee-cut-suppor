Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , East Africa’s biggest
mobile-phone company, snapped two days of gains after Business
Daily reported a  task force  appointed by Kenyan Prime Minister
 Raila Odinga  backed a cut in cross-network charges.  The company’s shares retreated 5 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
3.95 shillings as of 1 p.m. in Nairobi.  The decision means the fee that operators charge each other
to connect calls across networks will decline to 1.44 shillings
(2 cents) in July from 2.21 shillings, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing a report by the task force.  “The idea that it’s going to be reduced further leads the
market to believe that we might see tariffs reducing at that
point, which might point to reduced margins,” Eric Musau, an
analyst at Nairobi-based African Alliance Securities Kenya Ltd.,
said in a phone interview today. “What Safaricom and what
Telkom Kenya were proposing was that they wanted it kept on hold
so it doesn’t get reduced in this next phase.”  Any reduction may result in lower revenue for mobile-phone
companies that may reduce profit as well as investment in
infrastructure and new products, the newspaper said.  Safaricom will announce full-year earnings tomorrow.
Revenue is expected to jump 14 percent to 96.1 billion shillings
($1.1 billion) while earnings per share will rise 8.6 percent to
0.415 shilling, according to African Alliance’s forecast, which
is higher than the 0.367-shilling mean estimate by seven
analysts polled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
