Swaziland’s economic crisis is
threatening the peg between the country’s currency, the
lilangeni, and the rand, Business Report said, citing Martin
Dlamini, the country’s central bank governor.  The country’s gross reserves have fallen to 2.5 months of
import cover from 2.9 months in January while credit extended
for cars has fallen 2.8 percent and for other loans by 18
percent, he said in a statement, according to the Johannesburg-
based newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
