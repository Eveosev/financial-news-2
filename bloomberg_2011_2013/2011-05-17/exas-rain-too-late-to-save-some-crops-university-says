Rain last week in  Texas  alleviated
some wildfire concerns, while moisture “came too late” to save
some crops, according to an agricultural program at  Texas A&M
University  in  College Station .  About an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of
central Texas, with some areas receiving as much as 4 inches on
May 13, the university’s AgriLife Extension Service said today
in an e-mailed statement. More rain will be needed to improve
pasture conditions for livestock, according to the report.
Wildfires are still burning in parts of the far west and rolling
plains, where the “wheat harvest was under way, with below-
normal yields,” the report said.  Texas is the biggest cattle producing state in the U.S. and
ranks fifth for wheat output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
