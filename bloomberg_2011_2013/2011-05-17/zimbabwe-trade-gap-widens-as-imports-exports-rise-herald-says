Zimbabweâ€™s trade deficit widened to
$557.6 million in the first quarter from $496.9 million the year
earlier as exports and imports soared, the  Herald  said, citing a
statement from the  Finance Ministry .  Exports leaped 67 percent to $1 billion over the same
period, while imports jumped to $1.5 billion from $1.1 billion,
the state-controlled newspaper said. The deficit rose partly on
higher fuel costs, the Herald reported.  Aside from fuel,  motor vehicle , chemical, food and
telecommunications equipment accounted for the bulk of imports,
while minerals and tobacco were the biggest exports, the Herald
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
