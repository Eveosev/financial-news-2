Citadel Capital SAE gained the most
on record after one of the units of the Egyptian private equity
company said it found gold in a concession in  Ethiopia .  The shares rose 5.7 percent, the most since they were
listed in December 2009, to 4.84 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30
p.m. close in Cairo. That valued the company at 3.2 billion
pounds ($538 million).  Asec Co. for Mining said it found evidence of the existence
of gold near the surface in an area where it has exploration
rights in Ethiopia. The company said it completed the first
phase of drilling in the area and plans to start the second
phase in July and the third phase in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
