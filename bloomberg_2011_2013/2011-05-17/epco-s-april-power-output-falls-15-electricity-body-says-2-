Tokyo  Electric Power Co. produced
20.8 billion kilowatt hours of electricity last month, 15
percent less than a year earlier, according to a preliminary
report released today by  the Federation of Electric Power
Companies of Japan.   Output declined after customers conserved power and
factories cut output because of supply chain disruption
following the March 11 quake and tsunami, the federation said.  It was the second-biggest year-on-year decline for Tepco,
according to the federation. Output fell 17 percent in July
2003, it said.  Power generation by Tohoku Electric Power Co. dropped 19
percent to 5.8 billion kilowatt hours in the month, according to
the report, the biggest drop for the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
