CVC Capital Partners , manager of a
10.8 billion-euro ($15.3 billion) buyout fund, is in talks to
buy a stake in  Delachaux SA (DCH) ’s holding company, two people with
knowledge of the talks said.  Buyout firms including KKR & Co. and PAI Partners also made
offers last week and are out of the bidding, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the talks are
confidential. The shares of Delachaux, based in Genevilliers
near Paris, were suspended today at the company’s request
pending a press release, NYSE Euronext said in a statement.  Sogrepar, the Delachaux family holding company that owns
about 57.4 percent of the French railroad-equipment maker, hired
Cie. Financiere Edmond de Rothschild for advice in January after
some members of the family expressed willingness to sell shares,
said Delachaux Chairman Francois Delachaux in a phone interview
then. The process was aimed at making it easier for family
members to sell stakes among one another and won’t affect the
firm, he said.  A spokesman for CVC declined to comment. A spokesman for
Delachaux couldn’t be reached immediately for comment.  Delachaux, founded in 1902, has risen 31 percent to 78.8
euros this year in Paris trading, boosting the company’s market
value to 1.03 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
