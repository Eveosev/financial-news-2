Britainâ€™s profitable rail service
between  London  and Glasgow may be taken back into public
ownership after the current franchise, held by Virgin Trains,
runs out in May next year, the Financial Times reported, citing
an unidentified person close to the matter.  An application by Virgin for a two-year extension of its
West Coast main line franchise was rejected last year and the
government has postponed the start of a new contract until
January 2013, though Virgin may have its contract extended for
the intervening nine months, the newspaper said.  Trains on the East Coast main line between London and
Edinburgh are run by Directly Operated Railways, a state
company, and it would be easy for that company to operate the
West Coast line as well, the FT cited its informant as saying.  The results of a review of the franchising system are due
to be announced by Transport Secretary Philip Hammond on May 19,
the newspaper added.  Virgin Trains declined to comment, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
