Sazka AS’ revenue from the state
lottery fell 47 percent to 380 million koruna ($22 million) in
April from a year earlier,  CTK  reported, citing a report from
PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Income from the lottery amounted to 85 percent of Sazka’s
revenue in January, the newswire said.  The report was conducted for Sazka’s provisional creditors’
committee, the newswire added.  Sazka’s clients are cutting back on placing bets as the
bankrupt Czech lottery operator is struggling to pay overdue
winnings. The Prague municipal court initiated insolvency
proceedings against state-run Sazka on March 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
