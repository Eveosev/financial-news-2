SNS Reaal NV (SR)  said a reinsurance
transaction helped boost its financial strength as first-quarter
profit at the Dutch bank and insurer dropped 48 percent.  Net income fell to 21 million euros ($29.8 million) from 40
million euros a year earlier, the Utrecht, Netherlands-based
firm said today. The solvency ratio, which measures insurers’
ability to absorb losses, rose to 238 percent from 195 percent
at the end of last year.  SNS said it’s on course with a program to free up 700
million euros of capital by mid-2012 to repay aid from the Dutch
state. The firm received 750 million euros from the Netherlands
in 2008 and another 500 million euros from Foundation Beheer SNS
Reaal, its largest shareholder. SNS sold shares in 2009 to help
repay a first tranche of 250 million euros of support.  Measures to release capital include a reduction of retail
and small-business mortgages and the disposal of “selected”
insurance businesses, SNS told investors in November. A
reinsurance transaction on a savings-insurance portfolio freed
up 225 million euros in capital during the first quarter,
accounting for 18 percentage points of the increase in the
solvency ratio.  Profit at SNS’s insurance unit fell to 29 million euros
from 68 million euros a year earlier as the company posted net
realized losses on interest rate swaps of 23 million euros.  “The drop is only related to a negative return on
interest-rate derivatives put in place to strengthen the
insurer’s capital position, which worked out,” Chief Executive
Officer Ronald Latenstein said on a call today.  Loan impairments at SNS fell to 68 million euros from 103
million euros in the year-earlier period and 405 million euros
in the last quarter of 2010. The loss in the property-finance
unit narrowed to 57 million euros from 317 million euros in the
previous quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
