Copper fell in  London  for the first
time in four sessions as economic data signaled slowing demand
in the U.S., the world’s largest user after  China .  U.S. housing starts unexpectedly fell in April, and
industrial production stalled, reflecting a drop in automobile
output, separate reports showed. Copper has dropped 14 percent
since reaching a record in February on concern slowing global
growth would curb metal consumption.  “Demand did not warrant high prices,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in
 Chicago . “The market is searching for some type of base here.”  Copper for delivery in three months fell $40, or 0.5
percent, to close at $8,799 a metric ton ($3.99 a pound) on the
London Metal Exchange at 6:05 p.m. local time. The price reached
a record $10,190 on Feb. 15.  The metal fluctuated between gains and losses today,
earlier dropping as much as 1.4 percent and advancing as much as
1 percent. In  New York , copper futures for July delivery closed
at $3.9985 a pound on the Comex, up 0.8 cent, or 0.2 percent,
after slipping as much as 1.1 percent. The price reached a
record $4.6575 on Feb. 15.  “Long term, there is still going to be demand,” Ilczyszyn
said. “But we are seeing some risk-deleveraging. Prices will
come down quickly if the Chinese economy starts to falter.”  Aluminum, zinc, tin and nickel also dropped in London. Lead
rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
