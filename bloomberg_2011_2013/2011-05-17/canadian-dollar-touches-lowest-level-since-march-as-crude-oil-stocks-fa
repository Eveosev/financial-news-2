Canada ’s dollar rose versus its U.S.
counterpart, rebounding from the lowest level since March, as
crude oil, Canada’s largest export, erased its decline.  The loonie, as the currency is sometimes known for the
image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, was still down
against a majority of its most-traded peers. The U.S. dollar
dropped against all but two of the 16 most-traded currencies.  “Risk appears to be back on the table,” said  Camilla Sutton , chief currency strategist at the capital markets unit of
Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto. “Most asset classes are moving
in tandem higher. The U.S. dollar is notably weak.”  The Canadian currency rose 0.4 percent to 97.21 cents
versus the  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto, after earlier
touching 97.94, the weakest level since March 28. It ended
yesterday at 97.58 cents. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0287.  Futures on crude oil rose 0.3 percent to $97.65 a barrel in
 New York  after touching $95.02. The MSCI World Index of
developed-nation stocks decreased 0.6 percent, after dropping as
low as 1.1 percent earlier.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading
partners including the loonie, dropped 0.1 percent after gaining
as much as 0.5 percent as investors sought refuge.  Government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on two-year bonds
down three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.64
percent. The yield touched 1.63 percent, the lowest level since
March 21. The price of the 1.75 percent security maturing in
March 2013 climbed 5 cents to C$100.20.  Investment Flows  The loonie is trying to “penetrate option barrier
resistance,” said  Dean Popplewell , an analyst at the online
currency-trading firm Oanda Corp. in Toronto. With options at 98
cents expiring at the end of the month, traders will try to
prevent the greenback from appreciating beyond that level to
ensure the wagers finish at a profit, he said.  Foreigners purchased a net C$6.34 billion of Canadian
securities in March, split between stocks and bonds. Foreign
investors bought C$3.24 billion of bonds and divested C$209
million of money-market paper.  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest mutual fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said in a Bloomberg
Television interview yesterday that investors should focus on
alternatives to  U.S. debt  including top-rated Canadian and
Australian securities and higher-yielding emerging-market debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
