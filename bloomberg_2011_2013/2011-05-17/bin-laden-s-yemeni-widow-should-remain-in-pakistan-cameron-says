Prime Minister  David Cameron  said the
U.K. favors  Pakistan  being allowed to detain the Yemeni widow of
 Osama bin Laden  rather than releasing her to her native country.  The Associated Press reported today that a Yemeni rights
activist is seeking to repatriate Amal Ahmed Abdel-Fatah
al-Sada. She and her daughter, as well as two other bin Laden
wives and several children, are being held by Pakistani
authorities following the U.S. commando raid that killed the al-
Qaeda leader at his compound in Pakistan, AP said.  Asked by a lawmaker in Parliament in London today if
Pakistan should be able to detain her so the U.S. can question
her and the other widows, Cameron replied that he backed such a
course.  “I would certainly favor the Americans being able to do
that,” he told Parliament’s Liaison Committee. “I think this
is an absolutely vital time for American-Pakistani relations.”  Cameron said he did not think Pakistan’s political leaders
knew bin Laden had been hiding in their country. “Clearly bin
Laden had a support chain that went some way, that went into
Pakistan, but I don’t believe the president and the prime
minister knew,” he said.  “Democratic politicians” in Pakistan need international
backing to help counter terrorism, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
