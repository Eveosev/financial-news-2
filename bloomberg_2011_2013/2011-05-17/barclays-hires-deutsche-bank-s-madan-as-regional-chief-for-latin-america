Barclays Plc (BARC)  hired Karan Madan from
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  to serve as its regional head for  Latin
America , according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg
News.  Madan will be responsible for the trading of fixed income,
currencies and commodities in Latin America at Barclays Capital,
the investment-banking unit of Barclays Plc, according to the
memo. Madan, the former head of global markets for Latin America
at Deutsche Bank, will start at Barclays in August and will be
based in New York.  Barclays spokesman Brandon Ashcraft confirmed the contents
of the memo in an e-mailed message. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman
Renee Calabro declined to comment.  “Latin America has been a strategic focus of the firm for
the past decade and this appointment demonstrates our ongoing
commitment to further developing our platform in the region,”
Jerry del Missier, Barclays’s Co-Chief Executive of Corporate &
Investment Banking, said in the memo.  Barclays is announcing the hiring days after it lost two
top fixed-income executives in  Brazil  to Bank of America Corp.  Roge Rosolini, most recently Barclays’s head of fixed
income, currencies and commodities in Brazil, will co-lead fixed
income at Bank of America and Andre Rizzo will head fixed-income
and currency sales in Brazil, according to an internal memo from
the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank obtained by Bloomberg
News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
