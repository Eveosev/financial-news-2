Spain ’s regional and local
administrations have “hidden” debt, not included in the
official accounts, amounting to about 26.4 billion euros ($37
billion), according to research by Freemarket Corporate
Intelligence, a consulting firm, the Financial Times reported.  The latest figures from the Bank of Spain show that the
country’s 17 autonomous regions have almost doubled their public
debt, to 115 billion euros, since 2008, while municipal and
provincial debt has risen to 35 billion euros and central
government debt stands at 488 billion euros, the newspaper said.  However, public companies owned by local and regional
governments also have substantial debt, and in many cases it
doesn’t have to be included in the figures under European Union
guidelines, the FT reported.  This “hidden” debt is likely to be revealed by new
regional and local administrations to be elected on May 22, the
newspaper said.  Freemarket Corporate Intelligence is run by Lorenzo
Bernaldo de Quiros, a critic of Spain’s devolved system of
government, the FT added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
