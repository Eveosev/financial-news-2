The  Zimbabwe  African National Union-
Patriotic Front, led by President  Robert Mugabe , will use the
Southern African Development Community summit this week to
clarify what it sees as misinterpretations of the body’s rulings
on the country, the  Herald  said, citing Zanu-PF spokesman  George Charamba .  The SADC Tribunal, a law court, condemned Zimbabwe’s policy
of seizing most white-owned farms, a ruling that contradicted
Zimbabwe’s constitution, the Harare-based Herald said on its
website.  Charamba dismissed reports that Zanu-PF had increased
violent attacks on members of the Movement for Democratic
Change, saying police reports indicated the  MDC  was escalating
violence in the southern African nation, the Herald said.  SADC will meet May 20 in the Namibian capital, Windhoek, to
discuss Zimbabwe’s power-sharing government, the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
