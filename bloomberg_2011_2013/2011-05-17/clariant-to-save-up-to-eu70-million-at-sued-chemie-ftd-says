Clariant AG (CLN) , which is buying catalyst
maker Sued-Chemie AG, plans to save 50 million euros ($71
million) to 70 million euros at the German company with an
efficiency program,  Financial Times Deutschland said , citing
Clariant Chief Executive Officer Hariolf Kottmann.  The savings goal comes on top of 25 million euros that
Kottmann wants to save in administration, the German newspaper
said. Clariant, based in Muttenz,  Switzerland , plans to let
Sued-Chemie act independently to a large extent and top jobs
will be given to their own managers, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
