Developing nations should be able to
win tradable emission credits by improving their use of energy
efficient appliances or cutting the average carbon intensity of
national or regional motor-vehicle fleets,  South Korea  said.  So-called nationally appropriate mitigation actions may
include international programs that award credits when a nation
exceeds “success indicators,” the nation said in a  submission 
published yesterday on the website of the United Nations
Framework Convention on  Climate Change  in Bonn.  The rate of issuing credits through success indicators
should be lower than the rate for measurable and verifiable
greenhouse gas cuts, according to the submission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
