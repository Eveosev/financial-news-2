Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the world’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, said it may sell as much as 3
percent of Indian division Vodafone Essar Ltd. to a local
partner to comply with foreign ownership rules.  Vodafone, based in Newbury, England, in March said it
would buy an additional 33 percent stake in Vodafone Essar for
$5 billion from Essar Group. The deal will increase Vodafone’s
direct equity stake in the venture to 75 percent, while  India 
doesn’t allow foreign companies to own more than 74 percent in a
local mobile-phone operator.  The company may sell 2 percent to 3 percent of Vodafone
Essar, Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford told investors in
London today.  Vodafone Chief Executive Officer Vittorio Colao said last
month he may consider an initial public offering of its Indian
venture while another option was to sell a stake to smaller
local partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
