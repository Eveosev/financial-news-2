Japan ’s 20-year bonds fell, lifting
yields to the highest in more than a week, amid speculation the
central bank will refrain from adding to monetary easing.  The debt slid for a third day as local stocks advanced,
reducing demand for the relative safety of  government bonds . The
 Bank of Japan  will conclude a two-day policy meeting on May 20.
Policy makers voted down Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura’s
proposal last month to expand the BOJ’s asset-purchase program.  “Yields are too low,” said Makoto Noji, a senior bond and
currency strategist in  Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., one
of the 24 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt
sales. “I don’t expect a change in monetary policy that can be
a catalyst to buy bonds.”  The 20-year yield added 1.5 basis points to 1.955 percent
as of 3:15 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 2 percent security due
March 2031 lost 0.217 yen to 100.642 yen. The yield earlier
reached 1.97 percent, the highest since May 6.  Ten-year yields dipped half a basis point to 1.15 percent,
while five-year yields were unchanged at 0.44 percent.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery rose 0.04 to 140.64
at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY) 
Stock Average advanced 1 percent.  The  Ministry of Finance  will sell 2.4 trillion yen ($30
billion) in five-year notes tomorrow. The prior sale of the
securities on April 14 drew bids valued at 3.56 times the amount
on offer, in line with the average of the past 10 auctions.  Nishimura proposed boosting the BOJ’s asset-buying program
by 5 trillion yen to 15 trillion yen at an April 28 meeting.  “It’s unlikely Nishimura will suddenly stop putting
forward the idea,” said  Akito Fukunaga , chief rates strategist
in Tokyo at the brokerage unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.
“I don’t expect it to be approved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
