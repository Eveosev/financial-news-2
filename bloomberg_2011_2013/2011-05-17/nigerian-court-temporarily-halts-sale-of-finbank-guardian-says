Nigeria’s Federal High Court in the
commercial capital, Lagos, temporarily halted the central bank’s
sale of  FinBank Plc (FIRSTINL)  to  First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) , the
 Guardian newspaper  reported, citing Justice Okechukwu Okeke.  Okeke ruled that the memorandum of understanding to merge
signed by both lenders on May 5 be suspended, the Lagos-based
newspaper said.  The ruling remains in place until the court hears an appeal
against the sale brought by Finbank’s former managing director,
Okey Nwosu, and former executive director, Dayo Famoroti, on May
26, the Guardian reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
