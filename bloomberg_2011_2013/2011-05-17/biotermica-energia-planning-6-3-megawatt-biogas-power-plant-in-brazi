Biotermica Energia Ltda., a Brazilian
energy company, will build a 6.3-megawatt power plant that runs
on biogas emissions in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.  The plant is expected to go into operation by January 2013
and will run on combustible fumes collected from a landfill
managed by SIL Solucoes Ambientais Ltda., the countryâ€™s
electricity regulator Agencia Nacional de Energia Eletrica said
today on its website. The landfill generates about 2,000 cubic
meters of methane gas an hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
