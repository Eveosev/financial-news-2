Australia ’s Dalrymple Bay coal-export
terminal may not return to near full capacity until June
following floods and production difficulties at Bowen Basin
mines,  ABC News  reported yesterday on its website, citing
Anthony Timbrell from the terminal’s operating company.  The port has been operating at about 50 percent capacity
since late last year, ABC quoted Timbrell as saying. There isn’t
enough coal available to load the “vast majority” of the 17
vessels waiting off the terminal, the biggest in Queensland
state, he was cited as saying in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
