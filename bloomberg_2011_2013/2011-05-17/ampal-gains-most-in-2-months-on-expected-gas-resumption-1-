Ampal-American Israel (AMPL)  Corp. rose the
most in more than two months as it said gas deliveries to Israel
may resume at the end of the month and after the owner of a 12.5
percent stake in East Mediterranean Gas Co. reported a profit.  The shares soared 9.3 percent, the most since March 13, to
4.398 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  Ampal said it was advised by EMG that natural-gas
deliveries to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Egyptian
industrial and electric facilities in the Sinai may resume at
the end of May once new security measures have been implemented.  Ampal reported first-quarter net income of $17.2 million
after a year-earlier loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
