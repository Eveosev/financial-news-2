Housings starts in the U.S.
unexpectedly fell in April as flooding and tornadoes in the
South shut down construction sites and homebuilders continued to
struggle almost two years into an economic recovery.  Work began on 523,000 houses at an annual pace, down 11
percent from the prior month and less than the 569,000 median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, figures from
the Commerce Department showed today in  Washington . Building
permits, a sign of future construction, also decreased.  Falling home values and the prospect of more foreclosures
entering the market mean  home construction  will be slow to gain
traction. Unemployment at 9 percent and stagnant wages indicate
any recovery in housing may take years to unfold.  “Job growth is essential to household formation and to
keep  home prices  from falling further,” said  Eric Green , chief
market economist at TD Securities Inc. in  New York , who forecast
permits at 550,000. “I don’t see home sales doing much of
anything” for the foreseeable future.  Another report today showed industrial production
unexpectedly stalled in April, reflecting a temporary drop in
auto making after supplies of parts were disrupted by the
Japanese earthquake and tsunami, according to data from the
 Federal Reserve . Output was unchanged after a 0.7 percent gain
in March, figures from the Federal Reserve showed. Manufacturing
fell 0.4 percent, the report showed.  Treasuries Rise  Treasury securities  rose after the reports as the slowdown
in construction and manufacturing gives Federal Reserve policy
makers reason to keep  interest rates  low. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year note, which moves inversely to prices, fell to
3.12 percent at 10:09 a.m. in New York from 3.15 percent late
yesterday. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent to
1,324.51.  Housing starts estimates ranged from 500,000 to 600,000 in
the Bloomberg survey of 74 economists.  The Commerce Department revised March’s total to a 585,000
pace, up from a previously estimated 549,000. Starts reached a
record low 477,000 pace in April 2009.  Building permits fell 4 percent to a 551,000 annual pace in
April. They were projected to rise 0.9 percent to a 590,000
level, according to the survey median.  Construction of single-family houses decreased 5.1 percent
to a 394,000 rate in April from the prior month. Work on
multifamily homes, such as townhouses and apartments, fell 24
percent to an annual rate of 129,000, the weakest so far this
year.  Plunge in South  Starts dropped in two of four regions, led by a 23 percent
decrease in the South, the largest area. They fell 4.8 percent
in the Northeast and climbed 16 percent in the Midwest and 3.7
percent in the West.  All of the weakness in starts was due to the plunge in the
South, reflecting flooding on the  Mississippi River  that
continued into May, Morgan Stanley economists  David Greenlaw  and
Ted Wieseman wrote in a note to clients today. They forecast
starts to show “little increase” this year.  Last month was the 10th wettest April since record-keeping
began in 1895, with 875 preliminary reports of tornados, a
record for any month, according to the National Climatic Data
Center. Most wind damage occurred from the southern and central
plains to the Atlantic coast.  Confidence among U.S. homebuilders was little changed in
May, restrained by a drop in the sales outlook, a report from
the  National Association of Home Builders /Wells Fargo showed
yesterday. The group’s sentiment index held at 16 for a second
month. Figures less than 50 mean more respondents view
conditions as poor.  Existing-Home Sales  Sales of existing homes, which make up more than 90 percent
of the market, rose 2 percent to a 5.2 million annual pace in
April, economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the National
Association of Realtors may report on May 19. Purchases of
previously owned houses have been increasing on demand for
lower-priced distressed homes.  CoreLogic Inc. in March estimated about 1.8 million homes
were delinquent or in foreclosure, a so-called “shadow
inventory” set to add to the 3.5 million existing homes already
on the market.  Toll Brothers Inc. Chief Executive Officer Douglas Yearley Jr. last week said the April through June home selling season,
typically the busiest of the year, has been “disappointing”
and that “people are still scared.”  Demand for new houses will remain weak into 2012, said Bill
Wheat, chief financial officer of D.R. Horton Inc., who last
week also projected a housing recovery will take time to
develop.  Jeffrey Mezger , chief executive officer of Los Angeles-
based  KB Home (KBH) , said he expects sales to “bump along for the
next 18 months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
