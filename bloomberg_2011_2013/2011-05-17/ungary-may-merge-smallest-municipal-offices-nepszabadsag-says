Hungary  may merge the municipal
offices of villages with less than 2,000 inhabitants to cut
spending,  Nepszabadsag  reported today, citing a draft document
published in preparation for a new law on local government.  Out of 3,200 settlements in Hungary, 2,365 have less than
2,000 inhabitants, and would have “at most between 600 and
800” merged offices between them to run functions such as the
upkeep of roads and waste collection jointly for several
villages, the newspaper said, citing the proposal.  Editors: Robert Valpuesta  To contact the reporter on this story:
