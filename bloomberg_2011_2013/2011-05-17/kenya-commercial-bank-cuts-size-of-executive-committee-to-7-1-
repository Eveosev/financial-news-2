Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, announced
changes to its board structure that reduces the number of people
on its executive committee to 7 from 22.  Key changes include abolishing the positions of the two
deputy chief executive officers, the director of public affairs
and communication and the divisional director for special
projects, the Nairobi-based bank said in a statement e-mailed by
the city’s stock exchange today.  “The organization structure announced today will help
achieve many milestones which will include an efficient, lean
organization that will allow for faster decision making for the
benefit of the bank’s customers and other stakeholders,” Chief
Executive Officer Martin Oduor-Otieno said in the statement.  New positions of chief business officers for international
operations and for  Kenya  have been created. Except for the chief
executive officer, all positions within the executive committee
will be filled through a “transparent, professional and
competitive process, starting with an internal job interview
process,” the company said.  “Looking at the job description of the chief business
officers, they are going to be taking responsibilities of three
to four divisional heads, which means they will have a global
view of the bank,” Francis Mwangi, an analyst at Nairobi-based
African Alliance Securities Kenya Ltd., said by phone. “This is
critical when it comes to developing risk-management policies.”  KCB has units in neighboring Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and
 Southern Sudan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
