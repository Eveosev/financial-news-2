Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said U.S. fiscal problems are so pressing they may
threaten to undermine the economy and “our ability to protect
our national security interests.”  Geithner, speaking at the Harvard Club in  New York  today,
said the U.S. should get its deficit below 3 percent of gross
domestic product. The U.S. also needs a “debt cap so that
politicians cannot choose to live with unsustainable deficits,”
Geithner said.  -- Editor: Kevin Costelloe  To contact the reporter on this story:
