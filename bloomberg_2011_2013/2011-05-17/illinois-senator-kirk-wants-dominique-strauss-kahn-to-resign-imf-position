U.S. Senator  Mark Kirk  wants the U.S.
executive director of the  International Monetary Fund , Meg Lundsager, to seek the resignation of IMF chief  Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the lawmaker’s spokeswoman said.  Kirk, an Illinois Republican who serves on a Senate
appropriations subcommittee that has partial oversight of the
IMF, is also seeking hearings on how the international fund has
managed the European debt crisis, his spokeswoman, Kate Dickens,
said today in an e-mail.  Kirk would like to see Lundsager “call for the immediate
resignation of Mr. Strauss Kahn,” who was charged with sexual
assault and attempted rape by New York prosecutors, Dickens
said.  After Strauss-Kahn’s May 14 arrest, the IMF appointed
Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky as acting managing
director.  “We are aware of widespread speculation about the managing
director’s status,” William Murray, an IMF spokesman, said in a
press statement today. “We have no comment on this speculation,
other than to note, as we did earlier this week, that the
executive board was briefed informally on developments regarding
his arrest in  New York .”  The IMF’s executive board, meeting in Washington, agreed to
seek contact with Strauss-Kahn about his intentions, according
to an official briefed on the deliberations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
