New York Yankees reliever Rafael Soriano, in the first season of a three-year, $35 million
contract, was placed on the 15-day disabled list today because
of soreness in his right elbow.  Soriano has been experiencing discomfort in his pitching
elbow since May 1 and yesterday cut short a bullpen session in
 St. Petersburg ,  Florida . His lone relief appearance in the past
week was in a May 13 loss to the  Boston Red Sox .  The 31-year-old Soriano has struggled in his first Major
League Baseball season with the Yankees, with a 1-1 record and a
5.40 earned run average in 16 games. He’s allowed 26 baserunners
-- 15 hits and 11 walks -- in 15 innings.  Soriano signed with the Yankees as the set-up man for
closer  Mariano Rivera  after leading the American League with 45
saves last season for the Tampa Bay Rays. He’s had surgery on
his right elbow twice, most recently in 2008.  The Yankees, who have lost six straight games, brought
outfielder Chris Dickerson up from the minor leagues to replace
Soriano on the roster. Dickerson is starting in right field
tonight against the Rays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
