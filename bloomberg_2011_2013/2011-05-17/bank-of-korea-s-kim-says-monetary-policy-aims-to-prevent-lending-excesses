Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo
said that the central bank will manage monetary policy carefully
in order to avoid creating incentives for excessive borrowing by
households or companies.  The nation’s growing inflation expectations will likely
push up consumer prices over time and core inflation, which
excludes food and energy items, is expected to accelerate
further, Kim said in prepared remarks to be delivered today at a
seminar in  Seoul .  He also said the expected end of the second round of
quantitative easing in the U.S. makes the outlook for other
major economies more uncertain, adding to concerns over volatile
oil prices, Europe’s fiscal crisis, and the aftermath of the
March 11 earthquake in  Japan .  To contact the reporters on this story:
