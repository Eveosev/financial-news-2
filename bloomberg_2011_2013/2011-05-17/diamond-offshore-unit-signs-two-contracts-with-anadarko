Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO) , the
largest U.S. deep-water oil driller, signed contracts worth as
much as $1.8 billion with  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  for two new
drillships and settled a dispute over a third rig stemming from
a Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium last year.  Anadarko will lease two drillships for five years, starting
in 2013 and 2014, Houston-based Diamond Offshore said in a
statement today. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. is preparing
to build the two rigs in  South Korea , Diamond Offshore said.  The companies have also agreed to dismiss all claims
related to the Ocean Monarch rig, according to the statement.
Anadarko, based in The Woodlands, Texas, filed suit to void its
contract for the rig last year after the U.S. government halted
deep-water drilling in the Gulf following  BP Plc (BP/) â€™s record
offshore oil spill.  The announcement was made before regular trading began on
U.S. markets. Diamond Offshore rose 85 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$71.17 at 7 a.m. in New York. Anadarko fell 66 cents to $73.40
