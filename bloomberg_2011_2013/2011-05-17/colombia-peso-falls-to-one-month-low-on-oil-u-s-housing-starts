Colombia ’s peso fell to a one-month
low as oil, the nation’s main export, declined and an unexpected
drop in U.S. housing starts damped optimism about growth in the
world’s biggest economy.  The peso slid 0.3 percent to 1,827.26 per  U.S. dollar  at
1:07 p.m. New York time from 1,820.90 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,831.20, its weakest level since April 19. The peso has
gained 4.4 percent this year, the second-best performance after
the Mexican peso among six Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  “U.S. data is signaling the recovery isn’t as strong as
initially expected,” said Omar Escorcia, an analyst at Bogota-
based brokerage Asesores en Valores SA. “That’s also leading to
declines in oil.”  A report from the U.S. Commerce Department showed work
began on 523,000 houses at an annual pace, down 11 percent from
the prior month and less than the 569,000 median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey, as flooding and tornadoes in the South shut
down construction sites and homebuilders continued to struggle
almost two years into an economic recovery.  Oil, which accounts for about 40 percent of Colombia’s
exports, fell 1.7 percent to $95.76 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.24
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price rose 0.516 centavo to 113.814 centavos per peso.  About 10 trillion pesos of government debt coming due
tomorrow will likely be reinvested mostly in shorter-term
securities, Escorcia predicts. That will likely drive yields
lower in the securities due in 2012, he said.  The yield on the bonds due August 2012 fell two basis
points to 5.18 percent, according to the stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
