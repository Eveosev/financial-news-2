U.K. stocks rose, snapping the
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) ’s longest losing streak in two months,
as profit at  Land Securities Group Plc (LAND)  beat estimates and rising

trust, rallied 6.4 percent. British Land Co. added 4.6 percent.

percent.  Mothercare Plc (MTC)  paced the FTSE 250 Index higher,
climbing 5.5 percent, after saying it will shut more than a

amid the biggest commodities sell-off since 2008. The FTSE All-
Share Index climbed 1 percent today. Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid
0.7 percent.  “We are still convinced that during the current stage of

6-3 to keep  interest rates  on hold this month as the majority

and hamper the recovery.  Andrew Sentance  maintained his call for
a half-point increase in the key rate from a record low of 0.5

the report from Citigroup analyst Anindya Mohinta in  London 
today.  Mothercare jumped 5.5 percent to 448.5 pence, its largest
