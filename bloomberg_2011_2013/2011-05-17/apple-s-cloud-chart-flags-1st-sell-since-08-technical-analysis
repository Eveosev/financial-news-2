Apple Inc. (AAPL)  stock sent its first sell
signal since September 2008 based on a Japanese charting
technique, suggesting the maker of the iPhone, iPad and iMac may
slide 5.1 percent more, according to Dahlman Rose & Co.  Shares of the Cupertino, California-based company fell
below the lower cloud support on the daily ichimoku chart on May
13, with the lagging line undercutting its cloud. That suggested
the stock may continue its decline and approach its average
price during the past 200 days, said Rick Bensignor, chief
market strategist at Dahlman Rose. Apple closed at $333.30
yesterday, with its 200-day average sitting at $316.30.  “The structure of its chart has shifted away from the
bullish picture that has been in place for the past two years,”
Bensignor said in an e-mail. “At the very least, it tells me ‘I
don’t want to be buying Apple right now.’”  Apple dropped 8.2 percent through yesterday from a record
$363.13 on Feb. 16 as Sony Corp. introduced its first tablet
computer and Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy Tab had its second
price cut this year in April. The stock fell 0.6 percent to
$331.34 as of 11:15 a.m. New York time, headed for the fifth
consecutive decline, its longest losing streak since April 6.  Ichimoku charts use the midpoints of historic highs and
lows to analyze a security or index. Clouds, or areas between
two of the lines on the chart, are used to show levels where buy
orders may be clustered.  The last time both Apple’s stock price and its lagging line
broke below their clouds, on Sept. 5, 2008, the shares plunged
51 percent before they bottomed on Jan. 20, 2009, according to
data from Dahlman Rose and Bloomberg. So far this year, Apple
has risen 3.3 percent, trailing the 5.7 percent increase in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The stock rallied 53 percent last
year and 147 percent in 2009, beating the benchmark’s gains of
13 percent and 23 percent, respectively.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
