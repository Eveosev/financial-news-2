Sapporo Holdings Ltd. (2501) ,  Japan ’s
fourth-largest brewer, and Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co., the
nation’s largest zinc producer, led shares lower in Tokyo on
their removal from the MSCI Japan Index.  Sapporo fell 5.9 percent to 289 yen as of 10:26 a.m. in
Tokyo trading. Mitsui Mining lost 5 percent to 266 yen. 77 Bank
Ltd., a regional bank in the Tohoku area, tumbled 8.2 percent to
325 yen. Twenty shares will be removed from the MSCI Japan Index
as of the May 31 close of trading, according to a statement
yesterday by MSCI Inc., the index compilers.  The index amendments will likely prompt funds that mirror
the MSCI Japan Index, such as the  iShares MSCI Japan Index Fund (EWJ) ,
to adjust their holdings in the days leading up to the date the
changes take effect.  “It looks like the main reason for this is because their
prices fell dramatically, and many of the shares went from being
mid-cap stocks to small-cap stocks,” Eiji Kinouchi, chief
technical analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co., wrote
in a report today.  Other companies that will be removed from the index include
 Canon Marketing Japan Inc. (8060) , which distributes all Canon Inc.
products in the domestic market,  Ito En Ltd. (2593) , a beverage maker,
and  Hankyu Hanshin Holdings Inc. (9042) , a railway company which
operates in the Kansai region of Japan. No companies will be
added to the MSCI Japan Index, MSCI Inc. said.  Canon Marketing declined 3.5 percent to 829 yen, Ito En
retreated 3.7 percent to 1,332 yen and Hankyu Hanshin dropped 8
percent to 323 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
