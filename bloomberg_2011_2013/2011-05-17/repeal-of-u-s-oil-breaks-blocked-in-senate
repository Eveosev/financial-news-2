The  U.S. Senate  blocked a bid by
Democratic leaders to repeal $21 billion in tax breaks for five
multinational  oil companies  and use the revenue to reduce the
deficit.  The Senate voted 52-48, with 60 votes needed for the debate
to proceed, after Republicans argued the legislation would raise
gasoline prices and increase dependence on foreign oil.
Democratic leaders said they would seek to resurrect the measure
in budget negotiations with congressional Republicans and the
Obama administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
