BrasilAgro - Cia. Brasileira de
Propriedades Agricolas, a Brazilian farmland company, said it
canceled plans to sell additional shares after market conditions
worsened.  “Market conditions have deteriorated, so we decided to
cancel the offering,” Ana Ribeiro, an investor relations
coordinator, said today in a telephone interview from  Sao Paulo .
She declined to comment on alternative funding options for the
company.  BrasilAgro postponed the share sale twice this year, in
April and February, citing market conditions. The Sao Paulo-
based company planned to use about 70 percent of proceeds from
the offering to buy farmland, according to a preliminary
prospectus.  BrasilAgro is the third company to cancel a share sale this
year in  Brazil . Companhia de Aguas do Brasil canceled an initial
public offering in March and Inepar SA Industria & Construcoes
canceled a share sale in February, according to the Brazilian
securities regulator’s website.  BrasilAgro, which earlier today declined as much as 1.9
percent, erased some of the loss and closed down 0.5 percent at
10.65 reais in Sao Paulo trading today.  Banco Merrill Lynch de Investimentos was leading the
offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
