The  European Investment Bank  might
receive 300 million carbon permits ready for sale as early as
the second half of this year, the European Commission said.  The EIB will sell the allowances to raise about 5 billion
euros ($7 billion) to support low-emission technologies
including  carbon capture  and storage. Representatives of
national governments may vote May 19 on a commission plan to
enable transfer of allowances to the bank, Isaac Valero-Ladron,
the commission’s climate spokesman in Brussels, said today in an
e-mailed statement.  Climate Change Committee support for the proposal “would
allow the creation and delivery to the EIB of the allowances”
from a post-2012 carbon-market new-entrant reserve before the
bloc merges its 30 national registries into one, he said.  The commission proposal requires three months of scrutiny
by the EU council and parliament before formal adoption.
Decisions taken under this regulatory procedure usually take
four or five months.  “We will begin sales of the allowances within a month of
them being delivered to us and being made available for
settlement,” Nick Antonovics, an EIB spokesman in Brussels,
said today by e-mail. “It’s up to the European Commission to
comment on when delivery will take place and all issues related
to the union registry,” he said.  “Before sales start we will provide information about the
selling method or methods to be used,” Antonovics said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
