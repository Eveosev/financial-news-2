Mylan Inc., a U.S. maker of generic
medicines, was ordered by a Paris court to pay French drugmaker
 Ipsen SA (IPN)  17 million euros ($24 million) for presenting a pill to
pharmacists as a substitute for an Ipsen product.  Mylan marketed its drug, Vitalogink, as the “generic
drug” of Ipsen’s memory-aid pill Tanakan, rather than as its
“therapeutic equivalent,” the Paris court of appeals said in
its April 28 decision, reversing a 2008 commercial court ruling.  Mylan’s marketing was “meant to lead prescribers,
pharmacists and patients into error, to reap unwarranted profits
from the ensuing confusion, at Ipsen Pharma’s expense,” the
appeals court said.  Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Mylan will appeal the
decision to  France ’s highest appeals court, the company said in
a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
