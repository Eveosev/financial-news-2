Ghana ’s currency, the cedi, weakened
against the dollar as traders demanded the U.S. currency to
import  consumer goods .  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
traded at 1.5190 per dollar as of 2:43 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, from a close yesterday of 1.5113, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “There was activity on the market today, driven by dollar
purchases by traders importing consumables,” Kwabena Owusu, a
currency trader at Access Bank  Ghana  Ltd., said in a telephone
interview from Accra. “There were not a lot of supplies.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
