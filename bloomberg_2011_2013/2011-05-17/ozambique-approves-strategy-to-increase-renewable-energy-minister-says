Mozambique’s government approved a
strategy for the development of  renewable energy  to increase
access to electrical energy, Energy minister Salvador Namburete
told reporters on Tuesday  after the weekly cabinet meeting.  The 15-year strategy will start this year after the
government in 2009 said it was promoting the use renewable
energy sources to generate electricity in the southern African
country, Namburete said.  Energy generating sources including solar panels and wind
farms will be among the alternatives considered, he said.  Namburete didn’t say how much will be invested in the
strategy, although he added private sector investors might fund
and own some of the projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
