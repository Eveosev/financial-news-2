Several of  California ’s biggest
counties including  Los Angeles  may have to disclose the names
and retirement benefits of tens of thousand of government
employees following a court ruling, the Los Angeles Times said.  The first-ever such ruling on pension-related information
by the 3rd District Court of Appeal came despite arguments from
county officials and labor unions that it would violate state
employee privacy rights, the newspaper said.  The ruling ordered the Sacramento County pension system to
disclose the names and pension payments for 8,500 retirees, the
Times said. Ventura County’s retirement board agreed Monday to
release information on retirees and the pension benfits they
received, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
