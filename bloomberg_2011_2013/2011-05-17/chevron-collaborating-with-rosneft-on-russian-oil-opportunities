Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said it’s discussing potential “business
ventures” with Russian oil producer  OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  in that
country.  Chevron confirmed the talks a day after  BP Plc (BP/) ’s $7.8
billion share swap and Arctic exploration deal with Rosneft
collapsed amid opposition from billionaire partners in a
separate BP venture.  Kurt Glaubitz , a Chevron spokesman,
declined to specify what prospects, assets or locations within
 Russia  are under discussion.  “Chevron continues to work with Rosneft on opportunities
to collaborate in business ventures,” Glaubitz said today in a
telephone interview from Chevron’s San Ramon, California,
headquarters.  Chevron signed an accord with Moscow-based Rosneft in June
2010 to explore for oil and natural gas in the Russian sector of
the Black Sea. The arrangement called for initial investments by
the partners of $1 billion to drill wells in the West
Chernomorsky block, Rosneft Chairman Igor Sechin said at the
time.  Eleven months later, the companies and the Russian
government have yet to come to an agreement on fiscal terms.  Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving,  Texas , is the largest
U.S. energy company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
