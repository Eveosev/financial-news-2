The following companies had unusual
price changes in Chilean trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:13 p.m. New York time.  The Ipsa index closed little changed at 4,852.96.  E-CL SA (ECL CC) fell 4.4 percent to 1,310.1 pesos, the
most in four months. Northern Chile’s largest power generator
wasn’t included in the semi-annual rebalancing of the MSCI Chile
index. The stock had gained recently due to speculation of its
entry to the index, which would have forced foreign funds to buy
the stock, Cristian Castillo, a trader at Santiago-based
brokerage IM Trust SA, said in a telephone interview.  Enersis SA (ENERSIS)   gained 1.2 percent to 203.71 pesos,
its highest value in four months. The Latin American unit of
 Spain ’s Endesa SA was rated “overweight” at the brokerage unit
of Banco de Credito e Inversiones.  Salfacorp SA (SALFACOR)   rose 2.2 percent to 1,821.2
pesos, its highest value in four months and its sixth
consecutive day of gains. Chile’s largest engineering and
construction company and Colombia’s Conconcreto SA announced
yesterday they agreed to pay $32 million for 80 percent of
Panamanian builder Intercoastal Marine Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
