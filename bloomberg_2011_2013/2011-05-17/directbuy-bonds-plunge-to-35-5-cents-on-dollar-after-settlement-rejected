Bonds of DirectBuy Holdings Inc.
plunged for a second day after a judge in  Connecticut  rejected a
nationwide settlement of a class-action lawsuit over the
consumer club’s sales practices.   DirectBuy ’s $335 million of 12 percent notes due in
February 2017 dropped as much as 7.5 cents to a mid-price of
35.5 cents on the dollar, according to Brownstone Investment
Group LLC. The bonds, which are trading at the lowest level
since they were issued in January, climbed back to a mid-price
of 37.5 cents as of 11:05 a.m. in New York.  The debt, which was raised by the Merrillville, Indiana-
based company through a private offering led by JPMorgan Chase &
Co. in January, has plunged from 99.2 cents in February,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  U.S. District Judge Janet Hall said yesterday the proposed
class-action settlement would have allowed DirectBuy to settle
claims the court estimates may be worth more than $2 billion for
as little as $15 million. DirectBuy didn’t admit any wrongdoing
in the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
