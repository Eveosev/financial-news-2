Jordan’s trade deficit widened in the
first three months of the year because of increased imports of
oil, iron and machinery, the  Department of Statistics  said.  The shortfall increased to 1.67 billion dinars ($2.36
billion) through March from 1.33 billion dinars in the same
period a year ago, the department said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Crude oil imports rose 27.6 percent, iron jumped 53 percent
and machinery surged 32 percent from the year-ago period, the
department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
