Daimler AG (DAI)  and Rolls-Royce Group Plc
clinched a 3.4 billion-euro ($4.8 billion) takeover of German
engine-maker  Tognum AG (TGM)  after raising their bid and gaining the
support of the company’s board.  Members of Tognum’s management and supervisory boards,
which own about 5 percent of the stock, will tender their shares
after the suitors increased the bid by 8.3 percent to 26 euros a
share, the company said yesterday. With Daimler’s 28.4 percent
stake and a lower acceptance threshold of 30 percent, the
companies don’t require the backing of other investors to
complete the deal.  EQUITIES:
