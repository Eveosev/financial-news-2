Japanese  stock futures  rose as the
yen weakened and after Tokyo Electric Power Co. announced a
revised plan for stabilizing its stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear-power plant. Australian stocks futures fell.  American depositary receipts of Sharp Corp., which gets
half its revenue from outside Japan, advanced 0.6 percent from
the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Canon Inc., the
world’s biggest manufacturer of cameras, gained 0.2 percent.
Those of Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Australia’s No. 2 oil and gas
producer, fell 0.3 percent after  oil prices  declined.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,600 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,580
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at  9,600 in
 Osaka , at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index slid 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was
little changed in Wellington.  “The yen is weakening and that’s positive for Japanese
stocks,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “Stocks are cheap in terms of
valuations. That supports the market.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.1
percent today. In  New York , the index declined less than 0.1
percent to 1,328.98 yesterday as a reduced sales forecast at
Hewlett-Packard Co. and an unexpected decline in housing starts
damped optimism about the economic recovery.  Work began on 523,000 houses in April, down 11 percent from
the prior month and less than the 569,000 median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, figures from the Commerce
Department showed yesterday in  Washington . Building permits, a
sign of future construction, also decreased.  Nuclear Plan  Tokyo  Electric Power expects to cool reactors at its
stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant by as early as October,
maintaining its earlier timetable in an updated plan on
resolving the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years.  One month after releasing its so-called road map to
stabilize the Fukushima plant, the company known as Tepco
outlined more detailed steps at achieving a cold shutdown, where
the core temperature in the three damaged reactors falls to
below 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit).  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5.7 percent by the S&P
500 and 0.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.3 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500 and 11.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  The yen depreciated to 116.02 against the euro, compared
with 115.43 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday.
Against the dollar,  Japan ’s currency weakened to 81.59 from
81.40. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Crude oil for June delivery dropped 0.5 percent to $96.91 a
barrel in New York, the lowest settlement since Feb. 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
