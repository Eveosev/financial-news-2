The New Zealand dollar was little
changed after a government report showed prices paid by
producers for commodities and services needed to run their
businesses rose 2.2 percent in the first quarter, the fastest
pace since 2008.  The currency traded at 78.59 U.S. cents as of 10:48 a.m. in
Wellington from 78.52 cents before the data was released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
