Capital & Counties Properties Plc (CAPC) ,
the company formed in last year’s breakup of Liberty
International, acquired five properties in the Covent Garden
neighborhood of London for 68 million pounds ($110 million).  The properties near central London’s former fruit and
vegetable market were bought from  Derwent London Plc (DLN)  and they
will add 2.5 million pounds in annual rental income, according
to a statement. The buildings provide a mix of office space,
shops and residences.  Two weeks ago, CapCo raised 101 million pounds in a share
sale to finance acquisitions as it seeks to reposition  Covent
Garden  as a location for high-end retail and leisure outlets in
London’s West End district. The company attracted 36 new and
higher-paying tenants to Covent Garden last year, including
Apple Inc., helping lift the appraised value of its properties
there by 14 percent to 640 million pounds.  CapCo fell 7.5 pence, of 4.3 percent, to 168.1 pence in
 London  trading yesterday, trimming the value of the company to
1.15 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
