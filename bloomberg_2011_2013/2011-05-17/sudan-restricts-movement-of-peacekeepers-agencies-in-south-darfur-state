Sudan ’s government restricted all
movement in South Darfur state for non-governmental
organizations, the  United Nations-African Union peacekeeping
mission  and other UN agencies.  Citing “ongoing military operations and security
threats,” the Sudanese government restricted movement with
immediate effect to a 15-kilometer (9-mile) radius around Nyala,
the regional capital of South Darfur state, the mission, also
known as Unamid, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Today, Unamid verification teams weren’t allowed to reach
the Labado and Esheraya areas of South Darfur, where the army
attacked by air on May 15, leaving an unknown number of
casualties, according to the statement.  Insurgents in Darfur took up arms in 2003, accusing the
government of neglecting the region. The conflict has led to the
deaths of as many as 300,000 people, mainly due to illness and
starvation, and forced about 2.7 million to flee their homes,
according to UN estimates. The Sudanese government has put the
death toll at about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
