Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  is in talks
to buy London-based real estate broker King Sturge LLP for more
than 160 million pounds ($260 million),  Property Week  reported
on its website, without saying where it got the information.  The purchase would make Chicago-based  Jones Lang  the U.K.’s
largest commercial real estate broker by sales, the magazine
said. Madeleine Little, a spokeswoman for Jones Lang, said the
company doesn’t comment on speculation. No one at King Sturge
was immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
