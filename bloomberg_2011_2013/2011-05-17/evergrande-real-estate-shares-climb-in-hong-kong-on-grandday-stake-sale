     May 17 (Bloomberg) --  Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) ,
 China ’s second-largest developer by sales, stock advanced in
 Hong Kong  trading after saying it will sell a stake in its
Grandday Group Ltd. unit to  Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd. (127)   Evergrande climbed 3.9 percent to HK$5.57 as of 12:03 p.m.
local time in Hong Kong. Chinese Estates will pay $500 million
in cash for 49 percent of Grandday, which is developing a 1.58
million-square-meter (17 million-square-foot) residential,
business and resort complex in Qidong, in eastern China,
according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday.  “Bringing future sales forward is always a good thing as
you are eliminating future uncertainty and also reducing
risks,” said Kevin Gin, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Yuanta
Securities Co., in a phone interview. “The fact it is a third
party transaction confirms the valuation for the project.”  Evergrande will use the proceeds for general working
capital, the company said in a separate Hong Kong exchange
filing. Qidong, in Jiangsu province, is across the  Yangtze River 
from Shanghai.  Contracted sales at the Guangzhou-based company in April
rose 65 percent to 6.2 billion yuan ($953 million) from a year
earlier, the company said on May 11. They rose 11.5 percent from
March, while China Vanke Co., the country’s biggest developer by
market value, had a monthly sales decline last month.  Evergrande sold 26 billion yuan of properties in the first
four months of the year, reaching 37 percent of its annual
target, Chief Executive Officer Xia Haijun said at a  briefing  on
May 11. The developer’s expansion to so-called third tier, or
less affluent smaller cities, helped defy China’s property curbs,
Xia said.  China this year raised the minimum down payment for second-
home purchases and levied taxes on residences in  Shanghai  and
Chongqing. Major cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou imposed
restrictions on housing purchases in February.  Chinese Estates, the Hong Kong developer controlled by
billionaire Joseph Lau, fell 1.2 percent to HK$13.40.  --Bonnie Cao Editors: Andreea Papuc,  Malcolm Scott .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
