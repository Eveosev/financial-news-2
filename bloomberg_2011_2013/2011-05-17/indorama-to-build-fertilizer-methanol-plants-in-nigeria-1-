Indorama Corp.  of  India  plans to
build fertilizer and methanol plants worth $1.8 billion in
 Nigeria ’s southern city of  Port Harcourt , Managing Director
Manish Mundra said.  The operations will start production in 2014 and make 1
million metric tons of ammonia and urea fertilizers, Mundra said
in an e-mailed statement today. The company will also produce
methanol as an alternative fuel, he said.  “The fertilizer plant will be the largest single-train
urea plant in the world,” he said.  While Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer and has the
continent’s largest gas reserves, it imports most of its fuel as
it lacks refining capacity. The country hopes to attract more
than $10 billion of foreign investment in the petrochemical and
fertilizer industries, Oil Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said
on March 24.  The West African nation signed a memorandum of
understanding with Xenel Corp. of Saudi Arabia and  Nagarjuna
Fertilizers & Chemicals (NFCL)  Ltd. of India on March 24 to build
petrochemical and fertilizer plants in the southern Delta state
and in Lagos, the commercial capital.  Indorama paid $400 million for Eleme Petrochemical Co., a
unit of state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
