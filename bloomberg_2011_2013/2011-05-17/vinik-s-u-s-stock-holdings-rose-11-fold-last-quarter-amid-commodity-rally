Jeffrey Vinik, the Boston hedge-fund
manager who formerly ran the  Fidelity Magellan Fund (FMAGX) , increased
his U.S. stock holdings more than 11-fold during the first
quarter with an emphasis on commodity-related shares.  Vinik, the manager of JNV Partners LP, held stocks with a
market value of $4.66 billion at March 31, up from $411.8
million at Dec. 31, according to a Form 13F filed yesterday with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The largest bet was
a $296 million stake in Oil Services HOLDR Trust, an exchange-
traded fund that owns shares of companies involved in drilling
and other exploration-related tasks, including Houston-based
Halliburton Co. and Transocean Ltd. of Vernier,  Switzerland .  Vinik, 51, is known for making big moves in and out of
economic sectors by trading individual stocks and using leverage
to amplify his bets. In recent years, he has also increased
investments in ETFs, the term for funds that trade on  stock
exchanges , allowing investors to buy and sell them throughout
the day.  Vinik did not immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment. Mark Hostetter, the chief executive officer of Vinik
Asset Management, declined to comment.  According to yesterday’s filing, Vinik invested in about
150 stocks as of March 31, up from 31 at the end of last year.
He tripled his stake in  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to 443,500 shares, acquired
800,000 shares of Deere & Co. and bought 1.25 million shares of
FedEx Corp. with a stock-market value of $116.9 million at the
end of the first quarter.  Buys SPDR Gold  Vinik’s holdings in energy, metals and natural resources
stocks were valued at about $1.05 billion at March 31, up from
about $39 million at Dec. 31, according to the filing. These
holdings, which include a $111.9 million stake in the SPDR Gold
Trust and $86.7 million of shares in the Brazilian mining
company  Vale SA (VALE3) , had declined in value by about 10 percent since
March 31, based on yesterday’s closing prices.  Vinik managed Fidelity Magellan from July 1992 until May
1996, when it ranked as the world’s largest mutual fund with
more than $56 billion in assets. He established JNV Overseas in
2004 to invest his own money along with cash from friends,
family and a few outside investors, including billionaire  George Soros , people familiar with the fund have said.  Money managers who oversee $100 million or more of equities
traded on U.S. exchanges must file a Form 13F listing the
holdings each quarter. The filing, which includes convertible
bonds as well as funds and ETFs, is due 45 days after the
quarter’s end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
