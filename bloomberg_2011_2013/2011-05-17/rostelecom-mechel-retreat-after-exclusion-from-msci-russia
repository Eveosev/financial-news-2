OAO Rostelecom, Russia’s dominant
long-distance carrier, and the preferred shares of coal and
steel producer OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  slumped after they were not included
in MSCI Inc.’s Russia index yesterday.  Rostelecom’s stock dropped 7.1 percent to 165.31 rubles by
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, snapping a seven-day winning streak.
Mechel’s preferred shares retreated 4.8 percent to 421.74
rubles.  Brokerages including  Renaissance Capital , UralSib Financial
Corp.,  Alfa Bank  and Citigroup Inc. had forecast that the shares
would be included in MSCI’s semi-annual review.  Luis Saenz , the London-based director of international
sales at brokerage Otkritie Securities Ltd., said Rostelecom’s
exclusion was a “surprise” and is a “firm sell today.”
“Mechel preference shares were very much a consensus inclusion
and the favorite pick of a number of banks,” Saenz said in e-
mailed comments today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
