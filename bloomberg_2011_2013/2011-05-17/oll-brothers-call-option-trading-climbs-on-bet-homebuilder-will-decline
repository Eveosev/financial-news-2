Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  call-option
trading rose to the highest level since February following a bet
that the largest U.S. builder of luxury homes will decline.  Almost 14,000 contracts on the Horsham, Pennsylvania-based
company changed hands as of 2:04 p.m. in New York, 22 times the
full-day average during the past four weeks. A single investor
sold 11,000 of the June $20 calls in a bet the shares will fall,
said  Patrick Mortimer , director of options trading at Pipeline
Trading Systems LLC in New Hope,  Pennsylvania . Toll Brothers
rose 0.2 percent to $20.21.  Five years into the housing slump, factors such as the U.S.
unemployment rate at 9 percent continue to discourage home
buyers, Toll Brothers Chief Executive Officer Douglas C. Yearley Jr. said last week.  Home prices  may fall as much as 9 percent in
2011, Zillow Inc. said in a May 9 report.  “People are still scared,” Yearley said at a Wells Fargo
& Co. conference in New York on May 11. “We’re just
disappointed that demand hasn’t come back better.”  Toll Brothers shares fell 3.5 percent in a year through
yesterday, compared with the 12 percent retreat for a gauge of
12 homebuilders in Standard & Poor’s indexes. Toll Brothers is
scheduled to report second-quarter results on May 25. The
average of 17 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey calls for
a loss of 4 cents a share, excluding some items.  To contact the reporter on this story:
