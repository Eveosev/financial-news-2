Ablynx NV (ABLX) , the developer of drugs
based on antibodies found in llamas, said an experimental
rheumatoid-arthritis medicine licensed to  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  was found
effective in a mid-stage clinical study, validating the Belgian
company’s technology for the first time.  Injections with 80 milligrams of ozoralizumab every four
weeks reduced the incidence of swollen joints in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis after 16 weeks compared with placebo, the
Ghent, Belgium-based company said today in a statement. Pfizer
will evaluate whether and how to take the injectable anti-TNF
treatment forward, Ablynx said.  While Ablynx’s license agreement with Pfizer for anti-TNF
arthritis treatments is potentially worth as much as $212.5
million excluding royalties on sales, the findings of the study
mark the first time that an Ablynx-developed drug has shown
clinical efficacy in patients. Ablynx is working on at least 25
drug-development programs.  “The importance of this program should not be
underestimated,” Jan De Kerpel, an analyst at KBC Securities NV
in Brussels, wrote in a note today. “For biotechnology platform
companies, such proof of concept may open the gate to
substantial shareholder value creation.” De Kerpel recommends
buying Ablynx and expects the shares may climb to 11 euros in
the next 12 months.  Ablynx, which first sold shares for 7 euros apiece in a
November 2007 initial public offering, retreated 0.3 percent to
7.94 euros at the 5:35 p.m. close of trading on Euronext
Brussels. The study results were published at 6 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
