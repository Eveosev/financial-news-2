Beijing will this year reduce the
number of graduates from the city’s universities granted a
permit that allows them to become permanent residents of the
Chinese capital, the Beijing Times reported today.  The city may only grant about 6,000 so-called hukou permits
to graduate and undergraduate students who complete their
studies this year, the newspaper reported, citing an
unidentified official with Beijing’s human resources and social
security department.  China ’s capital had granted about 10,000 of
such permits annually in the past, according to the report.  Beijing has this year introduced policies that limit the
ability of non-residents to buy homes and to register cars in
the city as its population surged. China’s latest once-a-decade
national census conducted last year showed that Beijing’s
population increased to 19.6 million people in 2010 from 13.8
million in 2000.  The final plan for issuing residence permits to Beijing’s
university graduates will be set in late June, the Beijing Times
reported today. It is “virtually certain” that the quota will
be reduce by 30 percent or more, according to the report.  --Penny Peng. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News Staff for this story:
