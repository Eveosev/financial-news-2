Brammer Plc (BRAM) ,  Europe ’s biggest
distributor of bearings and power-transmission products, said
sales and profit this year have exceeded its forecasts, driven
by gains in market share and contract wins.  Gross profit margins have held at similar levels to last
year and all countries have shown an improving sales trend,
Brammer said in a regulatory statement today. Overall sales per
working day grew 18.5 percent in the four months since Jan. 1.  Four pan-European accounts were secured during the period,
with total potential revenue this year of about 30 million euros
($43 million), Brammer said.  “May has started well and we expect to achieve further
strong sales growth as a result of market share gains during the
rest of this year,” the company said in the statement. “We
believe all of our markets are now in growth and that our rate
of market share gain has increased.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
