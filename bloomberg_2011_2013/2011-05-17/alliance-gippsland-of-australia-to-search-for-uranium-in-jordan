Jordan will sign an agreement next
month with  Australia â€™s  Alliance Resources Ltd. (AGS)  and  Gippsland
Ltd. (GIP)  to explore for uranium in the southern parts of the
kingdom, the Jordan Energy Resources Inc. said today.  The Jordanian government, which plans to build at least one
nuclear reactor, plans to ratify the agreement with the
Australian companies soon, said Fakhruddin Daghestani, director
general of the state-run  company .  Exploration on a 22,000 square-kilometer (8,500-square
mile) stretch of land will start about a month after the signing
of the agreement, he said in a telephone interview from Amman.
The prospecting and exploration works are due to last for two
years after which a feasibility study will determine whether the
area will be open for commercial mining, he said.  Jordan, which relies almost entirely on imports for energy,
aims to attract $14 billion in energy infrastructure investments
and plans to develop more of its own resources, including
renewable energy and oil shale as well as nuclear power. The
kingdom has signed cooperation accords with 10 countries to
prepare for the construction of the nuclear reactor. The
government estimates it has 70,000 tons of uranium deposits.  To contact the reporters on this story:
