Produce Buying Co.,  Ghana ’s biggest
buyer of cocoa, plans to purchase 5 percent more of the beans
from farmers this season as the West African nation’s crop rises
to a record, Managing Director Kojo Atta-Krah said.  The company, based in the capital, Accra, will buy 315,000
metric tons of the beans by the end of the 33-week main crop
season on May 19, up from an earlier target of 300,000 tons,
Atta-Krah said by phone today.  “The harvest came through better than we all thought,” he
said. “We had to quickly speak to our bankers to make sure we
have adequate money at hand to meet the increasing supply.”  Ghana, the world’s second-largest cocoa grower, may produce
a record 930,000 tons this season, according to Yaw Adu-Ampomah,
deputy chief executive officer of the Ghana Cocoa Board, which
regulates the industry. The size of the main crop may climb to
860,000 tons while the light crop, which is harvested between
June and September, may produce 70,000 tons, he said on May 12.  Produce Buying had bought 300,000 tons of cocoa as of May
5, and it expects to have purchased another 15,000 tons by the
end of the season, Atta-Krah said.  Shares in the company were unchanged at 0.22 cedi as of
2:32 p.m. local time in trading on the Ghana Stock Exchange,
having gained 38 percent during the last 12 months, and giving
the company a value of 105.6 million cedis ($70 million).  Cocoa for July delivery, the most-active contract, fell 0.9
percent, or $28, to $2,978 per ton as of 10:26 a.m. in  New York .  The  Ivory Coast  is the largest cocoa producer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
