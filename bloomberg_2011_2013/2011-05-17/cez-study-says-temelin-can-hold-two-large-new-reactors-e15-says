A  CEZ AS (CEZ)  study found it would be
possible to build two new reactors with a capacity of 1,600
megawatts at the Temelin site,  E15  reported, citing Peter
Bodnar, head of CEZ AS’s investment unit.  The study, conducted by CEZ, showed there would be no
problems with cooling, connecting reactors of that size to the
distribution network or with safety, the newspaper said.  France ’s Areva SA, Westinghouse Electric Corp., and a
Russian-Czech group led by ZAO Atomstroyexport are competing for
a contract for new Temelin reactors valued at as much as $12
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
