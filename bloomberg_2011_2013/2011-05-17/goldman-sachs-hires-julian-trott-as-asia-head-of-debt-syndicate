Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank, hired Julian Trott as head of syndicate for
debt capital markets in Asia excluding Japan, according to an
internal memo seen by Bloomberg News.  Trott, who was previously at Bank of America Corp. in
London, will be based in  Hong Kong , the memo said. Edward Naylor,
a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, confirmed the
contents of the memo.  Investment banking, which includes mergers and acquisitions
and stock and bond underwriting, generated $1.27 billion in
first-quarter revenue at the New York-based firm, less than 11
percent of the total. Goldman underwrote $1.9 billion of bonds
in Asia excluding-Japan this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company promoted London-based Richard J. Gnodde to co-
head of  investment banking  and Gordon E. Dyal to co-chairman of
the investment banking division, according to a separate memo
seen by Bloomberg News yesterday.  --Henry Sanderson. Editors: Hugh Chow, Shelley Smith  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
