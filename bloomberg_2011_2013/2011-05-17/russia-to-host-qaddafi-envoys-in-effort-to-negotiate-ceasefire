Russia today hosts envoys from Libyan
leader  Muammar Qaddafi  in a bid to negotiate a cease-fire in the
North African country.  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will meet with Libyan
government representatives in Moscow this afternoon, his press
service said. Russia plans to host a Libyan rebel delegation
soon for similar talks.  “Russia is very keen to see a rapid end to the bloodshed
in  Libya ,” Lavrov said yesterday. “We have made it clear that
we are ready to support any regional and international efforts
that can achieve this.”  Russia abstained from the United Nations Security Council
 vote  in March that authorized military intervention by the U.S.
and its allies in Libya to protect civilians. It has since
accused the NATO-led air campaign of violating the resolution by
supporting the rebels and causing civilian casualties.  Libyan rebels say that if they accept  Russia ’s offer of
talks the only goal will be to persuade the government in Moscow
to support their cause and not to strike a cease-fire agreement
with Qaddafi’s forces.  “There is no Russian initiative,” Abdel Hafiz Ghoga, vice
president of the Transitional National Council, told reporters
in Benghazi yesterday. “If we think of going to Russia, it will
be to explain the situation and to change the Russian position
regarding the Feb. 17 revolution.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
