Foreign direct investment commitments
in  Algeria ’s non-hydrocarbon sectors grew almost eight-fold in
the first quarter, Abdelkrim Mansouri, director general of the
National Agency of Investment Development said.  The North African country attracted 452 billion Algerian
dinars ($6.2 billion) in the period that ended March 31,
compared with 59 billion dinars in the same period last year.
The amount includes the government’s agreement with Emirates
International Investment Co. on a $5.2 billion residential and
recreational project outside of the capital Algiers, Mansouri
said in an interview yesterday.  The leading investors in Algeria are from the United Arab
Emirates,  Saudi Arabia  and Jordan, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
