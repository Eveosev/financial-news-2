(Corrects export figure in headline. The story was first
published on May 16.)  Sudan ’s non-oil exports grew to
$451.9 million in the first quarter from $338.2 million in the
same period last year, the Khartoum-based  central bank  said.  Sales abroad of gold, which make up most of the country’s
non-oil exports, grew to $246.9 million from $169.7 million, the
bank said in an e-mailed statement today. Sesame exports
increased to $96.9 million from $51.3 million.  The North African nation’s gold exports will probably more
than double this year to $3 billion from about $1.4 billion in
2010, President Umar al-Bashir told parliament last month. Sudan
will expand gold mining and oil exploration in the north as the
oil-rich south is scheduled to be declared independent on July 9
after the region voted to secede from Sudan in a January
referendum, al-Bashir said.  At independence,  Southern Sudan  will assume control of
about three-quarters of the country’s current oil production of
490,000 barrels a day, pumped mainly by China National Petroleum
Corp.,  Malaysia ’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd. and India’s Oil &
Natural Gas Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
