BAE Systems Plc (BA/) ,  Europe ’s biggest
defense company, agreed to pay a fine of as much as $79 million
to settle an export regulations case with the U.S. State
Department.  BAE will pay the fine over three years and may receive a
$10 million reduction after putting stricter export controls in
place, the London-based company said in a statement today. Some
of BAE’s exports will be “subjected to enhanced administrative
review,” it said.  In March 2010, BAE was ordered to pay a $400 million fine
after admitting it conspired to defraud the federal government,
in a case with the U.S. Justice Department. It was fined 500,000
pounds ($815,000) last year in the U.K. after admitting that it
failed to keep proper records on payments to clients.  “Last year, the company reached a settlement with the  U.S.
Department of Justice  concerning historical violations of U.S.
defense export control regulations and this settlement with the
State Department arises in connection with its parallel civil
jurisdiction over such matters,” Chairman Dick Olver said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
