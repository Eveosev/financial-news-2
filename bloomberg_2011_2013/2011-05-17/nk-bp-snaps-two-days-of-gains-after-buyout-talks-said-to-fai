TNK-BP snapped two days of gains,
sliding the most in more than a week after buyout talks with  BP
Plc (BP/)  and OAO Rosneft failed.  The shares slid 3 percent, the most since May 5, to 80.22
rubles, by 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow.  Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil producer, is exiting an
alliance with BP which had been challenged by the U.K. company’s
existing Russian partners in TNK-BP, two people with knowledge
of the situation said, declining to be identified before a
public statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
