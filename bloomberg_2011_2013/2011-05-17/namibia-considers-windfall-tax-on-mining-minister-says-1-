Namibia  is considering introducing a
windfall tax on mining companies when mineral prices are high,
according to Mines Minister Isak Katali.  “The minister of finance wants to introduce more taxes for
the mining sector” to compensate for a decline in income from
the Southern African Customs Union, Katali said at the annual
meeting of the Chamber of Mines of Namibia today.  Namibia is the world’s biggest miner of offshore diamonds,
the fourth-largest uranium producer and also has deposits of
gold, coal and copper. The government wants to get more benefits
“in good times beyond normal taxes and royalties,” Katali said.  “The  Ministry of Mines  has asked the Chamber of Mines to
come up with proposals on how it wants the windfall taxes to be
implemented,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
