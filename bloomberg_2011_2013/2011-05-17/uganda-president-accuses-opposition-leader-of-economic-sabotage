Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
accused opposition leader  Kizza Besigye  of intimidating people
and economic sabotage for organizing protests against rising
prices, some of which turned violent.  Besigye has used “drug-users and even hired groups” to
loot property, Museveni said in an e-mailed statement from his
office in the capital, Kampala, today.  The aim of the protests were “to damage people’s property,
have some Ugandans killed and intimidate other Ugandans who do
not support their reactionary positions,” the Ugandan leader
said.  Besigye has been repeatedly arrested as he led so-called
walk-to-work protests against surging prices for food and
gasoline. Inflation accelerated to 14.1 percent in April from
11.1 percent in March, as food costs jumped 31 percent,
according to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. Yesterday, police
seized a car in which they thought Besigye was travelling and
towed it to a local police station, said Winnie Byanyima, his
wife.  The ruling National Resistance Army has embarked on
constitutional amendments to address the “indiscipline” and
will end Besigye’s “criminality using all the angles of the
law,” Museveni said.  Besigye came second in a presidential election in February
in which incumbent Museveni extended his 25-year rule after
garnering 68.38 percent of the ballots cast. Four opposition
parties claimed the vote was rigged and rejected the outcome,
calling for a new election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
