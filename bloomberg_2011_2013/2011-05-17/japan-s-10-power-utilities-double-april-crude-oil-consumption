Japan ’s 10 regional utilities more
than doubled their crude oil consumption in April from a year
earlier as they boosted output at thermal power plants.  The utilities, led by Tokyo Electric Power Co., consumed
397,558 kiloliters, or 2.5 million barrels, of crude, up from
180,863 kiloliters a year earlier, according to data released by
 the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan  today.  Power generation by the utilities fell 8.4 percent to 69.1
billion kilowatt-hours because of energy conservation and a
setback in industrial production following the March 11
earthquake and tsunami, the federation said.  Thermal power generation rose 6.3 percent in the month,
while output at nuclear power plants dropped 24 percent,
according to the federation’s data.  The following table shows Japanese utilities’ consumption
and intake of  fuel oil , crude, liquefied natural gas and coal
for April. Fuel oil and crude volume is in kiloliters, while LNG
and coal volume is in metric tons.
