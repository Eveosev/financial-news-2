Botswana will raise electricity
prices for industrial users and large companies by 30 percent
from June 1, the Ministry of Minerals, Energy and Water
Resources said.  The tariff for households and small businesses will rise by
15 percent, the Gaborone-based ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Prices may increase further this year to help Botswana
Power Corp. meet its operating and maintenance expenses and to
boost capacity, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
