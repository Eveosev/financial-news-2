Deutsche Bank AG, the biggest
foreign-exchange trader, advised selling the pound against the
 Swiss franc  over the European summer, and recommended investors
own the yen against the dollar and euro.  “On the U.K. side we see little prospect of a rate-hiking
path being initiated over the summer months,” George Saravelos,
a London-based currency strategist, wrote today in an investor
report.  The bank also retained its “bullish” view on the yen and
said the end of a second round of quantitative easing in the
U.S. should “provide some support to the dollar.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
