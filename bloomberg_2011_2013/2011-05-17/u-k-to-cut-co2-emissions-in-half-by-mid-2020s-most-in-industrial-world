The U.K. government said the country
plans to cut in half its greenhouse gas emissions by 2027, a
step beyond European Union pledges that already are among the
most ambitious in the industrialized world.  Britain aims to limit emissions of carbon dioxide to 1,950
million tons for the five years from 2023 through 2027, keeping
output on track for a 60 percent reduction from 1990 levels in
2030, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said today in
a statement. The EU has promised a 20 percent reduction by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
