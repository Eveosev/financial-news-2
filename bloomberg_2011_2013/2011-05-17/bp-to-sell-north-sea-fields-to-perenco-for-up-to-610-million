BP Plc said it agreed to sell its
interests in the Wytch Farm, Wareham, Beacon, and Kimmeridge
U.K. oil and gas fields to Perenco U.K. Ltd. for as much as $610
million as part of a plan to divest assets.  BP is selling assets to focus more on the  North Sea  and
shore up its balance sheet after last year’s Gulf of Mexico oil
spill. Today’s deal follows sales totaling around $25 billion.  The agreement “brings us even closer to the target of $30
billion of divestments by year end that we set out last
summer,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a
statement.  The London-based company said an immediate payment of $500
million has been made, another $55 million will be paid on
completion at the end of the year, and a final $55 million will
be contingent on submission of the Beacon field development plan
and on  oil prices  between 2011 and 2013.  Wytch Farm in Dorset, with total estimated recoverable
reserves of 480 million barrels, is located in one of the most
environmentally sensitive areas in the U.K., according to BP’s
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
