Yuri Milner, the Russian billionaire
who invested hundreds of millions of dollars in  Facebook Inc. ,
 Groupon Inc.  and  Zynga Game Network Inc. , raised about $1
billion for a new Web investment fund, a person with direct
knowledge of the matter said.  The financing of the DST Global 2 fund was completed a few
days ago, the person said, declining to be identified because
the information is private. The fund has institutional and
individual investors and will invest in late-stage Internet
companies, the person said. Milner’s spokesman Leonid Solovyev
declined to comment.  Milner’s first fund, called  DST Global  and set up together
with fellow Russian billionaire  Alisher Usmanov , owns about 10
percent of Facebook. Milner and Usmanov are among Internet
investors that have been backing some of Silicon Valley’s
fastest growing businesses. They led a $135 million investment
in daily-deals site Groupon last year and were part of a group
that put $180 million into Zynga Game Network, a social-gaming
service, in 2009.  Usmanov said on April 15 that he is “just a financial
investor” in DST Global 2 and that he may focus on working with
his existing Internet investments.  When Usmanov and Milner bought 1.96 percent of Facebook in
2009, the deal valued the company at as much as $10 billion.
Research firm Nyppex LLC valued the world’s most-used social
networking site at $65 billion as of mid-April this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
