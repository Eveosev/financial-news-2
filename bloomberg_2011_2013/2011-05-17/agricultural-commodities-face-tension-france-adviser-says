Agricultural commodity markets face
“tension” because of tight ending stocks, said  Philippe Chalmin , an economics professor at the University of Paris-
Dauphine and adviser to the French government. Following are
comments he made at a news conference today:  “Where we still have tension ahead is in agricultural
products. Where tension is to be expected is in grains and
oilseeds. We’re on a razor’s edge at the end of 2010-11. We’re
on a razor’s edge because we have no reserves, and in corn,
maybe also in soybeans, we could have an accident. We’re at the
mercy of the smallest weather disaster.”  “Farmers in  France  find themselves confronted with a major
problem of drought.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
