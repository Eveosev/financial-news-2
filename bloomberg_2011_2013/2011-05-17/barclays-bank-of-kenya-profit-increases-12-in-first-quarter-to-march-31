Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. (BCBL) , the East
African nation’s second-biggest lender by market value, said
first-quarter profit rose 12 percent as total non-interest
income, which includes fees and commissions, grew.  Net income climbed to 1.53 billion shillings ($18 million)
from 1.37 billion shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based
bank commented in a statement published in the Daily Nation
newspaper today. Total non-interest income advanced to 2.5
billion shillings from 2.2 billion shillings.  “The performance of the bank is reflective of the high
exposure to interest-rate volatility due to the high
contribution of interest income to total operating income,”
Nairobi-based Sterling Investment Bank Ltd. wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients. “Given this position, we are pessimistic on
the bank’s short-term outlook.”  Kenya ’s monetary policy committee unexpectedly raised its
benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 6 percent
on March 22, undoing a cut two months earlier, as it moved to
head off faster inflation. The nation’s inflation rate rose to
12.05 percent in April, exceeding the central bank’s 5 percent
target for the fourth straight month and increasing the chance
of further increases to the key lending rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
