Whole milk powder prices were little
changed at the latest auction, according to Fonterra Cooperative
Group Ltd. the worldâ€™s largest dairy exporter.  Powder for July delivery rose 0.7 percent from two weeks
earlier, according to a trade-weighted  price index  calculated by
the company after its latest  GlobalDairyTrade  auction. The
average price was $3,989 a metric ton.  Prices have gained just 1 percent the past four auctions
after a 20 percent slump in March amid expectations of greater
supply from  New Zealand  and more northern hemisphere milk
products entering the market. Prices reached a record $4,958 a
ton on March 1 and are likely to remain near those levels amid
strong demand from countries such as China and  India , Fonterra
Chief Executive Officer Andrew Ferrier said last month.  Fonterra, which accounts for about 40 percent of the global
trade in dairy products, sells whole and skim milk powder and
dried milk fat at its fortnightly Internet-based auctions. The
Auckland-based company offers one-month contracts with delivery
starting two months after the sale, and two three-month
contracts with delivery starting three and six months later.  Whole milk powder for delivery from August to October fell
0.3 percent, Fonterra said. Powder for shipment from November to
January rose 0.1 percent. Across all contracts prices gained
0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
