The euro may fall to a two-month low
against the dollar after dropping below support levels on two
different Fibonacci charts, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
said, citing trading patterns.  The euro “easily broke below” $1.4217, a 23.6 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its rally from a June 2010 low to a May
high, as well as $1.4148, a 38.2 percent retracement of its
advance from a January low to the May peak, said Teppei Ino, an
analyst at the unit of  Japan ’s largest bank in  Tokyo .  “The euro’s decline will accelerate after breaching the
$1.40 level,” Ino said. The currency now has a “potential
downside target” of $1.3770, a 38.2 percent retracement of the
rally from the June 2010 low to the May high, he said.  The euro traded at $1.4153 as of 12:18 p.m. in Tokyo after
strengthening from last year’s low of $1.1877 set on June 7,
2010, to as high as $1.4940 on May 4. The last time the currency
traded at $1.3770 was on March 11, the day Japan was struck by
its record earthquake.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. Key
percentages include 38.2, 50 and 61.8 and 76.4. A break above
resistance, where sell orders may be clustered, or below support,
where there may be buy orders, indicates a currency may move to
the next level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
