Colombia , the second-largest grower
of arabica coffee, said the weather pattern that has triggered
storms and floods this year is nearing an end.  Rainfall caused by the weather system known as La Nina will
ease gradually in June and July in the Andes mountains after
precipitation increased this month compared with April,
Colombia’s  Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental
Studies  said today in an e-mailed report.  Storms have battered farms across the Andes mountains of
Colombia, adding to a doubling in the price of arabica coffee in
the past 12 months in  New York . Colombian production dropped 19
percent in April to the lowest level in 15 months because of
damage to plants from rainfall last year, the National
Federation of Coffee Growers said May 12.  Precipitation probably will remain at or slightly above
historic averages in the Andes in June and soil moisture is
expected to decrease, the Bogota-based meteorology institute
said. Parts of Antioquia, the largest coffee-growing province,
will receive “moderate” rainfall in August before the rainy
season begins again in mid-September. The risk of mudslides that
can block roadways will persist, according to the report.  Cloudy days have limited sunshine and hindered the drying
of coffee beans, according to the federation.  The nation’s coffee output fell to 523,000 bags last month
from 647,000 bags a year earlier, the federation said. Coffee
exports declined 2.4 percent to 574,000 bags from 588,000 bags a
year earlier.  Brazil  is the largest grower of arabica coffee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
