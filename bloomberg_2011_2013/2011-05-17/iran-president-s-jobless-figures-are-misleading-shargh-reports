Unemployment statistics presented by
 Iran ’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are deceitful, according to
Ahmad Tavakoli, an economist and head of the parliament’s
research center,  Shargh  reported.  Ahmadinejad said in an interview with state television two
days ago that his government had created 1.7 million jobs in the
last Iranian calendar year ended March 20, that conflicts with
reality, Tavakoli told the Tehran-based newspaper.  Iran’s central bank failed to report figures for the
country’s gross domestic product in the past three years, which
appears to have been declining, the newspaper cited Tavakoli as
saying. Iran has been in a recession over this period, Shargh
reported him as saying.  The failure to disclose information allows some officials
to present false statistics and project a successful image,
Tavakoli told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
