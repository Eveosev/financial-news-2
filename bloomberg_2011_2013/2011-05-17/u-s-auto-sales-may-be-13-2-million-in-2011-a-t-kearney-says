Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Honda Motor Co.
and other Japan-based automakers may lose as many as 193,000
U.S. vehicle sales to competitors this year because of parts
shortages in their home country, an  A.T. Kearney  analyst said.  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC
may have about 3,000 sales “up for grabs” because of quake-
related disruptions, said Dan Cheng, lead partner of consultant
A.T. Kearney’s automotive practice. A.T. Kearney computed the
figures by estimating lost production for the U.S. market and
accounting for brand-loyal customers who may defer purchases.  If full output in  Japan  doesn’t resume until the fourth
quarter, disruptions from the quake may boost the number of
all automakers’ U.S. sales that are up for grabs to 328,000,
said Cheng, who’s based in Southfield,  Michigan .  “It’s a pretty big deal in a very highly competitive
market,” Cheng said today at a press conference in Birmingham,
Michigan.  The biggest beneficiaries of the disruptions will be GM,
Ford, Chrysler and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s largest
automaker, Cheng said.  Industrywide U.S. automobile sales may rise to 13.2 million
in 2011, which includes a 200,000-unit reduction as a result of
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, he said.  The average of 18 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg
last month was for 13 million total sales of cars and light
trucks this year. Light-vehicle sales in 2010 rose to 11.6
million from a 27-year low in 2009.  New-vehicle deliveries may reach 16 million in 2013, in
line with U.S. sales before the recession, Cheng said. The
average from 2000 to 2007 was 16.8 million deliveries, according
to Autodata Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
