U.S. nuclear-power production rose 1
percent as operators boosted reactors in Illinois, Georgia,
Florida and Louisiana, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased 776 megawatts from
yesterday to 76,730 megawatts, or 76 percent of capacity,
according to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twenty-six of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  boosted the 882-megawatt Quad Cities 2 reactor
on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River to 100 percent of
capacity from 85 percent yesterday. Another unit at the site,
the 882-megawatt Quad Cities 1, is shut. The plant is located
about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast of Moline.  Southern Co. (SO)  increased output at the 883-megawatt Edwin I.
Hatch 2 reactor in Georgia to 88 percent of capacity from 55
percent yesterday. The unit started on May 9 after it was shut
for repairs to the feedwater system on May 5.  Another unit at the site, the 876-megawatt Hatch 1, was
operating at full power. The plant is located about 74 miles
west of Savannah.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  raised power from the 693-megawatt
Turkey Point 4 Reactor in Florida to 41 percent of capacity from
4 percent yesterday. The reactor was shut for refueling and
maintenance from March 21 to May 2, then closed again on May 6.
The plant is located about 20 miles south of Miami.  Turkey Point 3 is operating at full power.  Entergy Reactor  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  boosted the 1,157-megawatt Waterford 3
reactor to full power from 75 percent of capacity yesterday. It
returned from a refueling and maintenance stoppage that began
April 6.  Waterford is on the Mississippi River about 25 miles west
of downtown  New Orleans .  PPL Corp. (PPL)  shut the 1,149-megawatt Susquehanna 1 reactor in
Pennsylvania. The 1,140-megawatt Susquehanna 2 unit is also
closed. The plant is located in Luzerne County, 50 miles
northwest of Allentown.  Exelon boosted the 1,152-megawatt Braidwood 2 reactor in
 Illinois  to 93 percent of capacity from 83 percent yesterday
after a refueling outage from April 18 to May 12.  Another reactor on the plant 54 miles southwest of  Chicago ,
the 1,178-megawatt Braidwood 1 unit, is operating at full power.  Exelon increased power from the 1,164-megawatt  Byron 1
reactor  in Illinois to full power from 92 percent of capacity
yesterday. The unit returned on April 25 from a refueling and
maintenance outage. Another unit at the plant 85 miles west of
Chicago, the 1,136-megawatt Byron 2, is operating at full
capacity.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
