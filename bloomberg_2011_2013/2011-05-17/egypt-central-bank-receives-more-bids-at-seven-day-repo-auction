Egypt ’s central bank accepted almost
twice as many bids for seven-day  repurchase agreements , or
repos, at an auction today compared with last week, according to
its data on Bloomberg.  The central bank sold contracts worth 8.21 billion Egyptian
pounds ($1.4 billion) out of the 10 billion Egyptian pounds it
offered. Last week it accepted bids for 4.88 billion pounds
after offering 7 billion pounds.  The North African country’s central bank started the repo
facility in March with a 9.25 percent annual interest rate to
boost bank liquidity. A popular revolt that overthrew the
government caused a rise in borrowing costs as foreign investors
shunned Egypt’s local currency debt, leaving local banks to
shoulder the burden. The contracts allow banks to sell
government debt securities back to the central bank for one week
in order to access funds.  The yield on the North African country’s 5.75 percent debt
due in April 2020 fell 5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 6.19 percent at 2:44 p.m. in Cairo. The pound lost 0.1
percent to 5.947 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
