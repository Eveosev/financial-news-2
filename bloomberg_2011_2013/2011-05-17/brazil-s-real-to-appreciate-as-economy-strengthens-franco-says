Brazil ’s real will continue to
appreciate in the long term as the country’s credit rating
improves, said Rio Bravo Investimentos partner and former
central bank president, Gustavo Franco.  Brazil is going through a transition to become a developed
economy, and the government won’t be able to prevent the
currency from getting stronger, he said in a May 13 interview in
 Rio de Janeiro . He declined to give a forecast for the currency
appreciation.  “Strong economy, strong currency,” Franco said in a May
13 interview in Rio de Janeiro.  Brazil’s real has risen 6 percent so far this year after
more than doubling in the previous eight years, the best
performance against the dollar of the 16 most-traded currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service rates Brazil Baa3 and  Standard &
Poor’s  has it at BBB-, both the lowest investment grade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
