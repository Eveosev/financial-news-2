Prices of tablet computers in  Brazil 
may fall as much as 36 percent after the government cuts taxes
on their production and sale, Communications Minister  Paulo
Bernardo  told reporters today in Brasilia.  The government is seeking to ensure an investment by
Foxconn Technology Group in  Latin America ’s biggest economy. The
maker of Apple Inc.’s iPhone and Dell Inc. computers is holding
talks with the government to expand their manufacturing in
Brazil, President  Dilma Rousseff  said during her trip to  China 
in April.  Positivo Informática SA, Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.,
Samsung Eletronics Co Ltd, Foxconn Technology Group and  ZTE Corp (000063) 
are among the companies that can benefit from the tax breaks,
Bernardo said in an interview yesterday with Bloomberg News.  Brazil set up a working group to make Foxconn’s proposal to
invest in the country viable, Science and Technology Minister
Aloizio Mercadante said in April. The Taiwanese company will
need infrastructure such as broadband services and airports, and
its investment in Brazil would probably attract a semiconductor
manufacturer to the South American country, Mercadante said.  The government plans to send a bill to Congress this week
eliminating some sales taxes, known as PIS and Cofins, and
reducing to 3 percent from 15 percent the tax on industrialized
goods produced in some states, Telecommunications Secretary
Nelson Fujimoto told reporters in Brasilia yesterday. The
government is also in talks to cut state sales taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
