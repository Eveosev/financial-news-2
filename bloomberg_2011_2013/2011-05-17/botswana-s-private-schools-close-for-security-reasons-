Private schools across Botswana
closed today for “security reasons,” as a strike by state
employees fuels violence in the southern African nation,
according to a statement by the schools.  The announcement on the Gabz FM radio station yesterday
came after the government closed all state schools following
fighting between students and clashes between pupils and the
police. The strike by state workers is in its fifth week.  The government said yesterday that all essential workers
who ignored a court ruling to return to work were dismissed with
immediate effect. The decision includes striking doctors and
nurses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
