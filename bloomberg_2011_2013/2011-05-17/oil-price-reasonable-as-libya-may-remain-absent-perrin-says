Oil prices  are “reasonable” amid a
wave of demonstrations and protests in the Middle East and North
Africa, Francis Perrin, managing editor of oil-industry
publication Petrole et Gaz Arabes and a professor at Pierre
Mendes- France  University in Grenoble, France, said today at a
press conference in Paris.  “The price of oil has remained rather reasonable.” A rise
in prices “is not extraordinary in such a context. The Arab
Spring probably added around $25 a barrel since January. Libyan
crude will probably be absent from the market for a long time.”  Consumption “will still rise significantly in 2011. Many
operators in the oil market are saying we’re heading for a
tightening of fundamentals that justifies a price increase.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
