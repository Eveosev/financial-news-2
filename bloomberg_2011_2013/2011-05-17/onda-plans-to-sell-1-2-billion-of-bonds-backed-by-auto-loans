Honda Motor Co. plans to sell $1.2
billion of bonds backed by auto loans, according to a person
with knowledge of the offering.  The largest top-rated portion, maturing in two years, may
yield from 20 basis points to 22 basis points more than the
benchmark swap rate, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms arenâ€™t public. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
