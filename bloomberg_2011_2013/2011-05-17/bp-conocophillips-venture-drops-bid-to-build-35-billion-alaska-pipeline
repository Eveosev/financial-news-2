Denali, a joint venture of  BP Plc (BP/)  and
 ConocoPhillips (COP) , said its open season efforts have not resulted
in the customer commitments necessary to continue work on its
Alaska North Slope gas pipeline project, which has an estimated
cost of $35 billion.  Denali said it will withdraw its Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission pre-file application and, over the next few months,
close out its operations. Denali said it has spent over $165
million and invested more than 760,000 man-hours in the project.
