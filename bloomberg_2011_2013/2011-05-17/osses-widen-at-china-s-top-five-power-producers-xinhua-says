China’s five biggest power generating
companies lost a combined 10.6 billion yuan ($1.54 billion) from
their coal-fired plants in the first four months of the year,
7.3 billion yuan more than the same period last year, the
official  Xinhua News Agency  reported, citing the China
Electricity Council.  The loss is due to “the fundamental reason of higher coal
costs and controlled electricity prices,” Xinhua said, citing
the council.  The report named the five companies as China Huaneng Group,
Datang International Power Generation Co., China Huadian Corp.,
China Guodian Corp. and China Power Investment Corp.  --Feiwen Rong. Editor: Nerys Avery  To contact the reporter for this story:
