Alex Ferguson  and  Carlo Ancelotti ,
coaches of Manchester United and Chelsea, have been warned about
their future conduct by English soccer’s ruling body after they
made complimentary comments about referee Howard Webb.  The coaches’ comments came before Webb refereed the game
between their clubs on May 8, when United’s 2-1 home win
virtually ensured the team’s record 19th league title.  Ferguson said World Cup final referee Webb was the “best
man for the job.” Ancelotti, saying he didn’t want to put
pressure on the referee, said “Howard Webb is a fantastic
referee, he has the skills to handle the occasion.”  The coaches’ remarks breached Football Association rules
against making comments about match officials appointed for a
specific fixture.  “It was considered to be a minor breach, but a breach
nevertheless, and it should be taken as a warning to all
managers in the future that any such breach, even positive
comments, are likely to result in a charge by the F.A.,” the
commission chairman was cited as saying in an F.A. statement
about Ferguson’s remarks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
