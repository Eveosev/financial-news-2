U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ,
praising the Arab Spring of democratic protests across the
Middle East and North Africa, said a similar revolt in Iran
should not be ruled out.  “The Iranian regime is one of the most dictatorial and
most repressive of all,” Cameron told lawmakers in London
today. “And if the Iranian people start to see that there is a
future for a democratic  Egypt  and a democratic Tunisia and a
Libyan people struggling to throw off their hideous leader, then
people in Iran who have attempted this before might think, well
actually we don’t have to go down this autocratic path.”  Iran is under four rounds of United Nations sanctions over
its nuclear program, which the U.S. and its allies say is aimed
at producing weapons.  Iran  says it is for generating power.  The European Union adopted sanctions last month against
human-rights violators in Iran. A U.S. State Department report
on human rights released April 8 said Iran pursued a campaign of
violence and intimidation against its own people in 2010,
committing extrajudicial killings and using amputation and
flogging as punishments.  “I think we can over-demonize Iran as a country run by
genius politicians who are strategic masters,” Cameron said.
“In many ways it’s an absolute basket case of a country. They
can’t even refine enough of their own oil; they are brutal in
terms of using the death penalty. We should be describing the
regime as much more backward rather than bigging them up. ”  To contact the reporter on this story:
