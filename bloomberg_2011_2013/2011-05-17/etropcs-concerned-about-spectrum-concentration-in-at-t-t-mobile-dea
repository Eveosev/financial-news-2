MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  said the
proposed $39 billion  AT&T Inc. (T)  purchase of T-Mobile USA risks
putting too much spectrum into the hands of one carrier as data
use increases on airwaves carrying mobile Internet.  “We are concerned about the concentration of spectrum that
that gives AT&T,” said Braxton Carter, chief financial officer
of the Richardson, Texas-based pay-as-you-go carrier. “Spectrum
is the life blood of our business and that puts AT&T in a very
significant spectrum position,” he said at the JPMorgan Chase &
Co. Global Technology, Media and Telecom conference in Boston.  Braxton said he was confident the U.S. Department of
Justice would require AT&T to divest some spectrum, the
government-licensed radio frequencies used in wireless
communications, as a condition of potentially approving the
deal.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  as well as Senators Herb Kohl, a
Democrat from Wisconsin and Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah,
have said they were concerned about what impact the
consolidation of AT&T and T-Mobile would have on the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
