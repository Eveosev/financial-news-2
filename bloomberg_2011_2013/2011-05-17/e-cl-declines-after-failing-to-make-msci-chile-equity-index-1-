E-CL SA, northern  Chile ’s biggest
power generator, fell the most in four months after missing out
on inclusion in the MSCI Chile index, which would have boosted
international demand for the stock.  E-CL, a unit of  France ’s  GDF Suez (GSZ) , retreated 4.4 percent to
1,310.1 pesos at 3:59 p.m. New York time. It earlier fell as
much as 8.8 percent, the biggest intraday slide since changing
its name from Edelnor a year ago.  E-CL was also the nation’s most traded stock today in
value, with $20.6 million changing hands.  “The stock had gained on speculation that it would make it
into MSCI Chile,” said Cristian Castillo, an equity trader at
Santiago-based brokerage firm IM Trust SA.  E-CL rose 10 percent this month through yesterday while the
IPSA index rose 0.7 percent.  MSCI Inc. announced yesterday that fishing company Cia.
Pesquera Camanchaca SA and real-estate developer Paz Corp SA
would be included in the index, increasing the number of members
to 19, according to a statement posted on MSCI’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
