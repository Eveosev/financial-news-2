Merit Group Inc., a maker of paints
and varnishes, filed for bankruptcy citing higher-than-expected
costs tied to an acquisition.  Debt totaled about $100 million, including $37 million of
unsecured trade debt, Merit said in Chapter 11 documents filed
today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Spartanburg, South Carolina,
where it is based.  Following the purchase of Five Star Products in January
2010, “the companies spent far more than anticipated for the
consolidation of warehouses and the integration of the
organizations, which put substantial stress on the debtors’
liquidity,” Merit said in court papers.  Regions Bank pledged $55 million in debtor-in-possession
financing to help fund operations while Merit restructures, the
company said.  Merit listed about 1,160 creditors. The largest unsecured
creditors include Rust-Oleum Corp., with a claim of $3.2
million; DAP, based in  Ohio , with a claim of $2.3 million; and
Minwax, with a claim of $1.9 million, court papers show.  The case is In re Merit Group Inc., 11-03216, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of  South Carolina  (Spartanburg).  To contact the reporter on this story:
