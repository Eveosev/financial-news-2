Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the
International Monetary Fund chief jailed at New York’s Rikers
Island prison complex on charges of sexual assault and attempted
rape, was placed on suicide watch at the facility, a person
familiar with the matter said.  Strauss-Kahn has made no attempt to injure himself, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the
information isn’t public. An assessment of Strauss-Kahn and
other factors, including that it’s his first time in jail, led
to the precaution, the person said.  Being on suicide watch at Rikers means that an inmate is
watched constantly and given a specially designed prison
jumpsuit and shoes with no laces, the person said.  “All inmate health records are confidential under the
law,” the  New York  City Department of Corrections said in an
e-mailed statement in response to a call for comment. The
department “follows the same protocol for the safety and
security of all inmates, and the protocol dictates that every
inmate is assessed for risk of harm to themselves and risk of
harm to others,” it said in the e-mail.  Defense attorney Ben Brafman, who represents Strauss-Kahn,
didn’t immediately return phone and e-mail messages seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
