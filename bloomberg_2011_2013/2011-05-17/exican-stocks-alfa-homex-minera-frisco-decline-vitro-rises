The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IPC index fell 0.9 percent to 34,819.57.  Alfa SAB (ALFAA MM), the world’s largest producer of
aluminum engine heads used in automobiles, dropped 3.8 percent
to 156.90 pesos as U.S. housing starts dropped in April,
dampening optimism about U.S. economic outlook. Work began on
523,000 houses at an annual pace, down 11 percent from March,
the Commerce Department said. U.S. automakers Ford Motor Co.,
General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC are among Alfa’s
largest customers.  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX* MM) fell 7.4 percent to
45.64 pesos, its lowest price since April 30, 2009, as Mexico’s
biggest homebuilder was removed from MSCI’s benchmark index for
the country. Shares have fallen 13 percent since the company
reported first-quarter net income on May 2 that missed analysts’
estimates.  Minera Frisco SAB, (MFRISCOA MM), the mining company
controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , retreated 1.8 percent to
43.87 pesos, its lowest price in four months, as gold futures
for June delivery dropped $7.10, or 0.5 percent, to $1,483.50 an
ounce on the Comex in New York. Silver dropped 1.9 percent. Gold
and silver represent about 52 percent of Frisco’s sales.  Vitro SAB (VITROA MM) rose 3.9 percent to 14.82 pesos. A
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge in  Dallas  said yesterday that the
glassmaker’s Chapter 15 bankruptcy case, filed in New York, is
being transferred to  Texas . The court earlier this month said
the Chapter 15 case should be moved to Texas to be administered
along with the Chapter 11 cases of five subsidiaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
