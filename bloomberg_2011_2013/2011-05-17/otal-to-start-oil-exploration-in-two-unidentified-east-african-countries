Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-largest oil
company, plans to start exploration in two unidentified East
African nations, Vice President for Exploration and New Ventures
Denis Francois said.  “We are still looking for new ventures,” he said at a
conference today in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. “We’re also
looking for discoveries made by others to help them develop
those discoveries.”  Total currently gets about a third of its global oil
production from  Africa , Francois said. The French company, which
has exploration activities in 14 African nations, is looking for
“high-risk, high-reward” opportunities, he said.  Total Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie last
week reiterated production growth targets through 2015 and said
output would be “relatively stable” this year and pledged
“bolder” exploration to find new reserves, citing drilling
offshore French Guyana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
