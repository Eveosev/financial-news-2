The oil market overreacted to the
loss of exports from  Libya  as supply and spare capacity are at
an “adequate level,” said Noe van Hulst, secretary general of
the  International Energy Forum .  “The financial oil market always exaggerates the impact of
any geopolitical unrest on the physical oil market even as
supply disruptions were always minimal,” Van Hulst said in a
May 14 interview at the headquarters of the IEF in Riyadh, the
capital of Saudi Arabia.  IEF data show that in the past 55 years, the physical oil
market has lost only 0.3 percent of total global output because
of supply disruptions, Van Hulst said.  “This period witnessed three wars in the Gulf region, an
attack on the Suez Canal,” he said. “These are big events
compared to what is happening in Libya.”  Van Hulst said there is a consensus among large oil
producers and consuming nations that geopolitical concerns are
overstated and that the physical markets are well supplied, with
comfortable levels of spare capacity and stockpiles.  Brent crude  on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
rose to a 2 1/2-year high of $127.02 a barrel on April 11 as
armed conflict halted exports from Libya and concern grew that
political unrest in the Middle East could affect other oil-
producing nations. It traded at about $111 a barrel today and
has gained 18 percent this year.  IEF is the largest global gathering of energy ministers
with over 80 countries including Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries member states, United States,  China ,  India ,
Russia, Brazil and  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
