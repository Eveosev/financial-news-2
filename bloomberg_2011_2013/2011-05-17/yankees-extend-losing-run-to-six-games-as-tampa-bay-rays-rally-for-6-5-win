The Tampa Bay Rays sent the  New York
Yankees  to a sixth straight loss, scoring five runs in the sixth
inning to rally for a 6-5 victory.  Sam Fuld and B.J. Upton hit two-run home runs off Yankees
starting pitcher A.J. Burnett as the Rays erased a 5-1 deficit
last night at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg,  Florida .  The Yankees’ skid is their longest since they lost seven
straight Major League Baseball games in April 2007.  New York fell to 20-19 and trails the first-place Rays (24-
17) by three games in the American League Eastern Division. The
Yankees’ slide began with back-to-back losses to the  Kansas City
Royals  before the team suffered its first 3-0 home sweep to the
 Boston Red Sox  in seven years.  Curtis Granderson hit his team-leading 14th home run for
the Yankees, who scored five runs in five innings off Rays
starting pitcher David Price.  Johnny Damon added his seventh home run of the season for
Tampa Bay and the Rays’ bullpen held the Yankees scoreless over
the final four innings. The teams are scheduled to finish their
two-game series today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
