South Africa’s ten-year bonds yields
rose at the government’s weekly auction on concern inflation
will breach the central bank’s target range, eroding fixed-
interest investors’ returns.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  sold 1.3 billion rand ($186
million) of 6.75 percent securities due 2021 at an average yield
of 8.44 percent, nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point,
higher than at the previous auction on May 10. Investors bid for
2.8 times the amount on offer, less than the 5.1 bid-to-cover
ratio on May 10.  Inflation will breach the upper range of the 3 percent to 6
percent target range in the fourth quarter, peaking at 6.3
percent in the first quarter of 2012, the central bank’s
Monetary Policy Committee said on May 12 after holding its
benchmark interest rate at 5.5 percent. The MPC will be
“vigilant” in monitoring inflation, Governor Gill Marcus said.  “Last week’s MPC has not given investors the kind of
guidance they may have hoped for with the central bank’s
increased inflation forecasts, only adding to the pressure on
bonds,” Tradition Analytics researchers led by Johannesburg-
based Quinten Bertenshaw said in a research note before the
auction. “In the near term, bonds may come under further
pressure.”  The central bank also auctioned 800 million rand of 6.25
percent notes due 2036 at an average yield of 8.9 percent, one
basis point higher than at the previous auction of the bonds on
April 5. Investors bid for 3.1 times the amount on offer.  Yields, Inflation  The 10-year notes rose before the auction in the secondary
market, pushing the yield down as much as 15 basis points, after
inflation accelerated at a lower rate than economists’
expectations in April. The bonds yielded 8.45 percent at 12:43
p.m. in Johannesburg, 14 basis points lower than the closing
yield yesterday.  South Africa ’s inflation rate rose to 4.2 percent in April,
from 4.1 percent the month before and 3.7 percent in February,
the Pretoria-based statistic agency said on its website today.
The April figure was lower than the 4.2 percent median estimate
of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The inflation outlook has deteriorated somewhat compared
to six months ago, on the back of higher global commodity and
food prices,” Kgotso Radira, a Johannesburg-based analyst at
Investec Ltd., said in a research note. “April’s inflation
outcome is in line with our view that inflation should rise
steadily this year, reaching the upper end of the target band by
year end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
