Venezuela ’s state mining company
Corporacion Venezulana de Guayana is affected by a strike this
week as workers seek unpaid benefits, El Nacional  reported .  Striking workers have blocked access to subsidiaries of the
state company known as CVG including Venalum, Alcasa, Bauxilum,
Carbonorca, Sidor and Ferrominera de Orinoco, the Caracas-based
newspaper reported today.  Workers are also asking for new boards of directors because
efforts to restore financial solvency haven’t been successful,
the newspaper reported, citing Venalum union President Manual
Diaz.  The strike is the third protest at the company this year,
and Mining Minister Jose Khan will hold talks with union leaders
on May 19 in Caracas, El Nacional reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
