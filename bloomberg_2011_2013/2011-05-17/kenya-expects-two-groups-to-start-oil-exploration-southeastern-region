BG Group Plc (BG/)  and  Dominion Petroleum
Ltd. (DPL)  will lead two separate groups in an oil exploration bid in
 Kenya , the East African nation’s Commissioner of Petroleum
Martin Heya said.  They are expected to get licenses for the blocks in Lamu by
the end of the week, Heya told a conference in the capital,
Nairobi, today.  “By the end of this week, all things being equal, we shall
have two companies” joining the ones that are already exploring
in East Africa’s biggest economy, he said.  Lamu, which is located in southeastern  Kenya , has one
offshore and eight onshore blocks that are available for
exploration, Heya said. Cnooc Ltd.,  China ’s biggest offshore
energy explorer, told the Kenyan government in October it plans
to drop licenses to search for oil and gas in two Kenyan blocks
by December. The Chinese company worked with  Africa Oil Corp. (AOI) 
and Lion Energy Corp. to drill an exploratory well in block 9 in
northern Kenya. It also had a license for block L2, an inland
area in the Lamu basin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
