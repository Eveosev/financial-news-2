BTA Bank Chairman Arman Dunayev
resigned as deputy head of the stateâ€™s National Wellbeing Fund
Samruk-Kazyna amid government plans to reorganize oversight of
BTA and other state-controlled lenders.  Aidan Karibzhanov, chairman of Alliance Bank and a former
managing director of Samruk-Kazyna, will replace Dunayev, the
Astana-based fund said today in an e-mailed statement. Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, was named to head Samruk-Kazyna last month.  BTA defaulted in April 2009, two months after it was taken
over by Samruk-Kazyna. Temirbank and Alliance Bank also
defaulted during the global financial crisis. All three have
reached restructuring agreements with creditors, allowing them
to write off about $11 billion of debt.  Kazakhstan plans to create a new company to oversee its
holdings in the three lenders under the oversight of Samruk-
Kazyna, central bank Chairman Grigori Marchenko said April 19.
The state owns 81.5 percent of BTA, 67 percent of Alliance and
79.9 percent of Temirbank, according to data posted on the
Kazakhstan Stock Exchange website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
