France ’s malting-barley crop could
have “very poor yields” because of drought, said Francois
Luguenot, head of market analysis at Union InVivo, the largest
exporter of French wheat. Following are comments he made at a
news conference and in an interview today in Paris:  On France’s soft-wheat crop:  “It’s true that there is drought. The plants also have an
extraordinary capacity of resilience. We face a large number of
uncertainties. It’s too early to say the harvest is lost.”  On France’s malting-barley crop:  “Malting barley is harder hit by the drought because it’s
planted in spring. The establishment was decent but then there
was no rain. The spring barley never benefited from the good
period. The yields could be very disappointing. So in spring
barley there is a real concern about availability. It developed
very poorly, few tillers and poor grain heads.”  On wheat prices:  “Today it seems the market is pricing in a return of
 Russia  as of July.” If Russia doesn’t export, “then we have a
real problem. The countries on the Mediterranean will be back in
July, August. They don’t want to take any risk with availability
that would put the regime in place at risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
