Petroleos de  Venezuela  SAâ€™s Amuay and
Cardon refineries in western Venezuela are still days away from
restarting full operations, Ultimas Noticias reported.  The refineries, part of the Paraguana Refining Complex in
Falcon state, was affected by a  power outage  on May 12, the
Caracas-based newspaper reported today.  The blackout shut catalytic cracking units and other plants
that produce lubricants, petroleum coke and naphtha fuels, the
newspaper said, citing union secretary Ivan Freites.  The Paraguana Refining Complex has the capacity to process
940,000 barrels of oil a day and includes the Amuay, Cardon and
Bajo Grande refineries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
