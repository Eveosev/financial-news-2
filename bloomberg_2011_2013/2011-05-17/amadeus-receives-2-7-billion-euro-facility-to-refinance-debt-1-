Amadeus IT Holding SA (AMS) , a Spanish
flight-reservations provider, signed a 2.7 billion-euro
($3.8 billion) credit agreement to refinance debt.  The arrangement consists of a 900 million-euro loan
maturing in 4 1/2 years, bridge loans of a combined 1.6 billion
euros and a revolving credit line of 200 million euros, the
Madrid-based company said today in a statement.  Chief Financial Officer Ana de Pro said on May 9 that
Amadeus would seek to reduce debt costs by the end of 2011 to
help boost the stock. Institutions providing the funds include
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ,  Natixis (KN)  and the  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , the
Spanish company said today.  “We welcome this refinancing agreement from Amadeus, which
also comes earlier than expected, despite also acknowledging
that we do not consider it definitive,” Banco BPI SA analysts
Eduardo Coelho and Joaquin Garcia-Romanillos wrote in a research
note today.  Amadeus will use the new facility to obtain “more
flexibility through extended maturity periods and improved terms
and conditions,” and to diversify its financial resources, de
Pro said in today’s statement.  Amadeus rose as much as 3.5 percent to 14.40 euros, the
biggest intraday jump since April 13, and was up 2.3 percent as
of 11:06 a.m. in Madrid trading. That pared the stock’s decline
this year to 9.3 percent, valuing the company at 6.36 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
