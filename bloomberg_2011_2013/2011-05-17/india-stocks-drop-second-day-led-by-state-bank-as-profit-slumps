Indian stocks dropped for a second
day, dragging the benchmark index to an eight-week low, led by
 State Bank of India (SBIN)  after its fourth-quarter profit tumbled to
the lowest in at least 10 years.  State Bank , the nation’s largest lender, sank 8.1 percent,
the most since July 2009, after net income plunged 99 percent in
the three months ended March as provisions climbed. Oil &
Natural Gas Corp., the largest oil producer, slumped the most
since November 2008 after CNBC TV18 channel reported state-run
explorers will contribute 38.5 percent of the cost of
subsidizing fuel prices for the year ended March 31, citing
unidentified people and without giving the earlier percentage.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
lost 207.68, or 1.1 percent, to 18,137.35, the lowest level
since March 22, according to preliminary closing prices as of
3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National
Stock Exchange retreated 1.1 percent to 5,438.95. The BSE 200
Index declined 1 percent to 2,251.60.  Overseas investors sold a net 37.1 billion rupees ($822
million) of Indian stocks on May 13, the biggest single-day sale
in at least 13 years, according to data on the  website  of the
 Securities and Exchange Board of India . The withdrawal reversed
the year-to-date balance for a net outflow of 23.9 billion
rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
