Borrowers from the  Persian Gulf 
aren’t tapping the syndicated loan market, preferring to rely on
financing from individual banks, according to  Standard Chartered
Plc. (STAN)   “I don’t see lots of companies coming to the market for
new money,” Steve Perry, a Dubai-based managing director at
 Standard Chartered , said during a conference in the emirate
today. “The borrowers that are able to raise new money are
looking at bilaterals.”  Demand for loans has slowed amid the political turmoil in
North Africa and the Middle East that drove borrowings costs
higher. Syndicated loans declined 71 percent to $5.36 billion
this year for the Middle East and North Africa from the same
period in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Companies and governments from the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council will need to refinance about $20 billion of
existing debt this year, said Adil Kurt-Elli, a director at the
CEEMEA Debt Capital Markets division at HSBC Bank Middle East
Ltd. The amount can “easily be absorbed” by lenders, according
to Elena Ivanova, head of new market loans at  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)   “The market is there for $20 billion of refinancing for
this region,” HSBC’s Kurt-Elli said during the conference.
“You have the capacity to get that financing done.”  Standard Chartered was the fourth-biggest mandated arranger
of loans in the Middle East and North Africa among 44 banks this
year, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
