Royal Philips Electronics NV is being
probed for alleged bribery in  Poland ,  Het Financieele Dagblad 
says, citing research material from the country’s public
prosecutor.  Hospital directors may have been offered money in exchange
for ordering Philips medical equipment, the newspaper reported.
Philips, the world’s largest maker of patient-monitoring
systems, has started an internal investigation and fired three
employees involved in the case, according to the newspaper.  Philips does not comment on pending investigations,
spokesman Joost Akkermans said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
