More than 230,000 people in eastern
 China â€™s Jiangxi province are short of drinking water because of
drought, Xinhua News Agency said, citing an unidentified
spokesman at the provincial flood control and drought relief
headquarters.  The people facing shortages are mainly rural residents in
the northern part of the province, the official news service
said today. The drought started in spring and has caused 131
pumping stations to stop functioning properly, Xinhua said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
