Avis Europe Plc (AVE) , the second-biggest
car rental company on the continent, will offer an hourly rental
program throughout  Europe  this year as demand among city
dwellers increases, Chief Executive Officer Pascal Bazin said.  “You can rent hourly in the city, and if you need a nice
convertible on the weekend, you can go out of the city,” Bazin
said in a telephone interview today. The company will probably
double the number of stations offering hourly rental, from 45
today, over the next year, he said.  Avis Europe, majority owned by Belgian automobile dealer
 D’Ieteren SA (DIE) , is capitalizing on a trend popularized by U.S.-
based Zipcar Inc., renting vehicles by the hour mainly to urban
residents. The company is also looking to expand in  China  and
 India , where growth is faster than in Europe.  Reservations are growing at a rate of 10 percent or more in
China and Avis Europe, which now has about 40 outlets in China,
plans to have 100 by the end of 2012, Bazin said.  “This is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world
for our business,” he said. “People are driving more and more
cars, traveling by airplane more and more.”  The poor condition of roads is hampering expansion in
India, he said.  Avis Europe’s rental income rose 5.2 percent in the four
months through the end of April compared with the same period a
year earlier, led by gains in corporate and insurance hires, the
Bracknell, England-based company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
