British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) ’s
Australian unit said it will cut prices if the country passes
legislation to ban branding on cigarette packages.  BAT  Australia  Chief Executive David Crow told reporters
today in Sydney that the legislation wouldn’t reduce smoking
rates and would result in a flood of cheap and illegal products.
The company,  Europe ’s largest cigarette maker, has a 42 percent
share of Australia’s tobacco market and makes Lucky Strike and
Pall Mall cigarettes.  “We will be forced to lower price over the short term to
compete with the illegal tobacco market,” Crow said. “They
will sell for 30 to 40 percent lower than normal cigarettes,
which means more people will smoke.”  Health Minister Nicola Roxon unveiled the proposal on April
7 that would force cigarettes to be sold in plain dark olive
packages with health warnings. Company names will appear on the
boxes in uniform size and style of printing. The legislation, if
passed by parliament, will take effect Jan. 1, 2012.  Opposition Liberal-National leader  Tony Abbott  said the
coalition would support the laws if there was evidence it would
reduce the number of smokers.  Australia last year increased tobacco taxes 25 percent and
began an A$85 million ($90 million) four-year advertizing
campaign to combat smoking. Smoking costs Australia A$31.5
billion each year, mainly through health expenses.  The Australian Greens party today said it wants a floor put
in tobacco prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
