Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s agreement to
purchase Skype Technologies SA for $8.5 billion may set a
precedent for higher acquisition premiums, lifting the cost of
other technology buyouts, an EMC Corp. executive said.  “The premium appears to be significant,”  Mark Lewis ,
chief strategy officer at EMC, said today at Bloomberg Link’s
Enterprise Technology Summit in New York. “If we go to do
acquisitions, there will be comparables. It’s like real estate
-- it’s all based on what’s sold. It’s a starting point.”  The price represented a 40 percent markup from what Skype
itself said the company was worth in an April regulatory filing.
Still, Robert Eatroff, managing director of  investment banking 
at  Morgan Stanley (MS) , said it’s too early to tell whether there is
a bubble in technology valuations. There is real growth in the
industry in areas such as mobile and cloud products that may be
legitimately driving up valuations, he said.  “We have huge secular growth in data and analytics, cloud
and mobile,” he said. “Will some of these valuations look like
they’re bubbles? Time will tell, but there are real drivers.”  Brett Shockley, senior vice president of corporate
development and strategy at Avaya Inc., also said the situation
doesn’t feel like the Internet bubble of 10 years ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
