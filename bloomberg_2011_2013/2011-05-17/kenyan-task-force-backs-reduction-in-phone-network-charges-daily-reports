A task force appointed by Kenyan
Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  to probe claims of predatory pricing
in the telecommunications industry backed a reduction in cross-
network charges, Business Daily reported.  The decision means the fee that operators charge each other
to connect calls across networks will decline to 1.44 shillings
(2 cents) in July from 2.21 shillings, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing a report by the task force.  Any reduction may result in lower revenue for mobile-phone
companies that may reduce profit as well as investment in
infrastructure and new products, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
