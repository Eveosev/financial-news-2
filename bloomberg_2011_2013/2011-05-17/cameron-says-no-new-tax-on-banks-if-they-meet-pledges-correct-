(Corrects to insert dropped word “don’t” in second
paragraph.)  U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said there will be no new taxes on banks if they meet lending
commitments they made under “Project Merlin.”  “If they don’t fulfill their side of the deal then clearly
the government won’t have to fulfill its side of the deal,”
Cameron told a panel of lawmakers in the House of Commons in
 London  today. “Bank lending is the key to getting the British
economy moving in a consistent and sustainable way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
