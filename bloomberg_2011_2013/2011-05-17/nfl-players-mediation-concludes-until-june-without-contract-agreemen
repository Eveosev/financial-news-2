The  National Football League  and its
players concluded their latest court-ordered mediation today
without reaching a contract agreement.  Owners, players and lawyers for both sides left federal
court in Minneapolis, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in an e-
mail.  Jeff Pash , the NFL’s chief negotiator, said both sides
would return in early June.  The NFL and players are scheduled for a June 3 hearing at
the U.S. Court of Appeals in St. Louis. That court ruled
yesterday that owners may continue their two-month-old lockout
of players while awaiting the hearing on their request to
overturn a lower-court order for them to end the shutdown.  Both Aiello and George Atallah, a spokesman for the NFL
Players Association, declined to comment on the progress of
talks.  Commissioner Roger Goodell attended today’s talks, along
with owners Jerry Richardson of the  Carolina Panthers , Mike Brown of the Cincinnati Bengals, John Mara of the  New York
Giants  and Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Aiello said.  Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Mike Vrabel attended the
talks along with players’ lawyers, Atallah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
