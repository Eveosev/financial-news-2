  Siemens AG (SIE) , Europeâ€™s largest
engineering company, said the majority of growth towards its
goal of 100 billion euros in sales will come from internal
expansion, with some acquisitions likely at its new division for
infrastructure and technologies used in cities.  Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher , speaking at the
Electrical Products Group Conference in Longboat Key, Florida,
said Siemens is closely following a list of potential targets
and may buy businesses operating in so-called smart-grid
applications. The company has no major gaps to fill, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
