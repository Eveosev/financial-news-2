Tanks from Yemen’s armed forces
rolled into the southern cities of Taiz and Aden in anticipation
of marches to the local presidential palaces, activists said.  Troops were deployed in Taiz following several hours of
power outages last night and armed men in plainclothes patrolled
the city streets today, activist Bushra al-Maktari said by
telephone. In Aden, the military fired warning shots in several
districts to discourage demonstrations, Fawaz Sharabi, a
witness, said by phone.  Protests in Yemen demanding an end to President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s rule are in their third month. At least 100
people have been killed by security forces in demonstrations
that began on Feb. 11, according to the Arabic Sisters Forum for
Human Rights in the capital, Sana’a.  The uprising has continued after the government and the
Joint Meetings Parties failed to sign a Gulf Cooperation
Council-brokered plan last month. Under the terms of the plan,
Saleh would have ceded power within a month of signing the deal
and would be granted immunity from prosecution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
