Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the world’s
largest brokerage, hired Mark Rice as chief operating officer of
its hedge-fund services business.  Rice, who joins the bank from  Advent Software Inc. (ADVS) , worked
at Morgan Stanley for 20 years before starting his own company
in 2004, according to an internal memo from Seth Weinstein,
chief executive officer of the fund-services unit, obtained by
Bloomberg News today. Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for New
York-based Morgan Stanley, confirmed the memo’s contents.  Morgan Stanley started its fund-services unit, which
provides accounting, financial reporting and other back-office
services to hedge funds, in 2004. The unit administers more than
$120 billion of hedge-fund assets and has more than 400
employees, according to a note to clients in March.  Rice was chief technology officer of Morgan Stanley’s prime
brokerage before starting Tamale Software Inc., which developed
research-management systems for investment firms. Advent bought
Tamale in 2008 for about $60 million, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
