Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  and Caja Madrid, Spainâ€™s three largest
banks by assets, have started offering mortgages on pre-crisis
terms, with loan-to-value ratios of up to 100 percent for 40
years, as they try to sell off repossessed homes, the Financial
Times reported, without citing anyone. Savings banks La Caixa,
CAM and Bancaja are also offering 100 percent loan-to-value
mortgages over 30 to 40 years, the FT said, without saying where
it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
