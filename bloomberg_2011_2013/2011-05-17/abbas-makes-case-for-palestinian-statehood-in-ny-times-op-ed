Palestinian Authority President
 Mahmoud Abbas  said the Palestinians will request international
recognition as an independent state within the 1967 borders at
September’s meeting of the  United Nations  General Assembly,
according to an opinion piece published by the New York Times.  “Palestine’s admission to the United Nations would pave
the way for the internationalization of the conflict as a legal
matter, not only a political one,” Abbas writes. “It would
also pave the way for us to pursue claims against Israel at the
United Nations, human rights treaty bodies and the  International
Court of Justice .”   Abbas writes that while negotiations with Israel “remain
our first option,” due to their failure “we are now compelled
to turn to the international community to assist us in
preserving the opportunity for a peaceful and just end to the
conflict.”   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
