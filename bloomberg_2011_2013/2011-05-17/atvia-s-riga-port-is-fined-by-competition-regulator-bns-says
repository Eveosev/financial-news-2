Riga port was ordered to pay a fine
of 105,000 lati ($210,000) by the Latvian Competition Council,
the  Baltic News Service  reported, citing a statement by the
regulator.  The watchdog ruled that PKL Flote, a tugboat company, was
banned from starting services without adequate justification,
the newswire reported, adding that the port plans a court appeal
against the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
