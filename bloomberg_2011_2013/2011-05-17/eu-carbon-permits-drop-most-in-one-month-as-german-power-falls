Permits to discharge carbon dioxide
under the European Union emissions-trading system fell the most
in one month as German power prices weakened, curbing the
incentive to hedge in the forward markets.  EU permits for delivery in December dropped as much as 1.7
percent to 16.61 euros ($23.52) a metric ton and closed at 16.64
euros on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, the biggest daily
drop since April 18.  German baseload power for next year, a European benchmark,
lost 0.9 percent to 58.65 euros a megawatt-hour as comments by
Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen fanned speculation that
the country’s exit from atomic energy may not be accelerated.  Germany ’s decision in March to shut the oldest reactors for
a safety review after the nuclear crisis in  Japan  and plans by
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  to speed up an exit from atomic energy
helped push electricity prices for 2012 to a 19-month high of
60.80 euros on April 5.  Roettgen said today in Berlin that Germany should avoid a
sudden retreat from nuclear energy, based on a report addressing
the safety of the country’s 17 atomic  power plants .  “After this report, the responsible path would be not to
exit immediately,” he said. “The decision has to be on the
basis of a rational method and a thorough assessment.”  Lower power prices can weaken the incentive to sell
electricity forward, easing demand for CO2 permits. The EU
emissions trading system imposes discharge limits on more than
11,000 power plants and manufacturing companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
