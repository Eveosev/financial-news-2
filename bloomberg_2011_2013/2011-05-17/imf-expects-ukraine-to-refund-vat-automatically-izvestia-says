The  International Monetary Fund 
expects Ukraine to automatically reimburse value-added taxes to
60 percent of taxpayers,  Ekonomicheskie Izvestia  reported,
citing the IMFâ€™s Ukrainian Mission Chief Thanos Arvanitis.  The Washington-based lender has also urged Ukrainian 
authorities to speed up the payment in VAT reimbursements,
according to the newspaper. Paying back VAT is part of an
agreement between the government and the IMF from a $15.2
billion bailout loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
