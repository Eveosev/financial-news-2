Seven Egyptian banks have frozen a
567 million Egyptian-pound ($95 million) loan to  Palm Hills
Developments SAE (PHDC) , Al  Shorouk  reported, citing unidentified bank
officials.  The decision was made as a precautionary measure because of
inquiries into corruption claims against some Palm Hills
stakeholders, including Chairman Yasseen Mansour, who owns 23
percent of the company, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
