Abbott Laboratories (ABT) ’ cholesterol pill
TriLipix may have its uses limited in the U.S. or be subject to
more testing after a study suggested the drug doesn’t protect
against heart attacks or strokes better than a generic medicine.  The  Food and Drug Administration  is also considering
whether to add data from the clinical trial to TriLipix’s
prescribing information, according to a  report  released today.
Outside advisers to the agency will consider the proposed
options at a  meeting  May 19 in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland .  The review focuses on a study released in March 2010
comparing Abbott’s TriCor, an older version of TriLipix also
known as fenofibrate, to the generic cholesterol pill
simvastatin. New FDA restrictions may jeopardize near-term sales
of TriLipix, which together with TriCor generated $1.58 billion
last year, or 4.5 percent of revenue for the  Abbott Park ,
Illinois-based drugmaker.  “Since complete data were not available, it is difficult
to definitively assess the safety profile of fenofibrate plus
simvastatin versus simvastatin plus placebo,” the FDA said in
its staff report.  The trial, dubbed Accord, followed about 5,500 patients
with Type 2 diabetes who were at high risk of developing  heart
disease , for an average of almost 5 years. Study results showed
no significant reduction in the number of heart attacks, strokes
and cardiac deaths in people taking TriCor along with
simvastatin, compared with those taking simvastatin alone.  Possible Outcomes  The FDA is asking its advisory panel to weigh whether
TriLipix should be withdrawn for use with a statin, continued to
be used with a statin with data from the study added to the
prescribing information, tested in a new study or face no
changes.  TriLipix is the focus of the FDA’s review because TriCor
isn’t approved for use in combination with a statin treatment.  About two-thirds of the study participants didn’t have high
triglycerides and low levels of good cholesterol, two criteria
for use in the drugs’ prescribing information, said Jim
Stolzenbach, head of cardiovascular development for Abbott, in a
telephone interview. Patients who met those criteria benefited
from TriCor, he said. The trial was funded by the  National
Institutes of Health .  The risk to Abbott will be minimized because TriCor is
already expected to lose revenue when cheaper copies enter the
market beginning in mid-2012, according to  Larry Biegelsen , an
analyst at Wells Fargo in  New York . He estimates that sales will
fall to $990 million next year because of generic competition
and decline further in later years.  Delayed-Release Version  Abbott said in October that about 30 percent of patients
had switched from TriCor to TriLipix, a delayed-release version
that was approved in 2008.  Amarin Corp., a Dublin-based biotechnology company
developing a competing medicine for high cholesterol, may see a
“small positive” from a change to TriLipix’s prescribing
information, said Joseph Schwartz, an analyst at Leerink Swann
in Boston, in an April 26 note to clients. Amarin’s drug AMR101
has a “pristine safety and tolerability profile” and may be
submitted this year for FDA approval, Schwartz said.  Abbott fell 50 cents to $53.50 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Amarin’s American depositary
receipts, each representing one ordinary share, dropped 20
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $16.41.  Last year, Abbott abandoned efforts to win approval for
Certriad, an experimental heart pill that combined TriLipix with
Crestor, from London-based  AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
