Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
Australia’s third-largest iron ore exporter, hired five banks to
help it obtain $1.5 billion of loans, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  are arranging the debt, the person said, asking not to
be named as the details haven’t been made public.  Fortescue, based in Perth, will use part of the funding to
help pay for the $8.4 billion expansion of its Pilbara iron ore
operations, according to a filing yesterday to the Australian
stock exchange. The project will almost triple Fortescue’s
output, helping meet demand for ore from steel mills in China,
the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Fortescue is seeking a $1 billion  term loan  and a $500
million revolving three-year facility, it said yesterday. The
proceeds from the term loan will fund the expansion while the
revolving loan will be used for general corporate purposes,
according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
