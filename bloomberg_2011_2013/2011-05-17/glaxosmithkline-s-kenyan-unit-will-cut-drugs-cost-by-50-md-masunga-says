GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s Kenyan unit
will cut prices of “essential” drugs by 50 percent to boost
volumes, Managing Director John Musunga said.  In 2009, the Nairobi-based company lowered the cost of some
of its drugs by 10 percent, followed by a 40 percent reduction
last year in the price of Avamys, an asthma medication, which
raised sales by 60 percent, Musunga said in an interview today.  “What that has shown us is that people like good-quality
medicine, but are not able to afford it,” he said. “We cannot
afford to focus only on the high-income social groups.”  GlaxoSmithKline is cutting prices in  Kenya  as part of a
plan to reduce the cost of its “essential” drugs in  developing
countries  to as little as 25 percent of prices in the developed
world, the company said in a statement today.  “Reducing prices of antibiotics, asthma medicines and
dewormers will enable poor households to afford quality
medication within their meagre budgets,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
