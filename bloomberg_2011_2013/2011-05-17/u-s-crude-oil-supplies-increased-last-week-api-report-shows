Crude oil inventories rose 2.67
million barrels last week to 369.9 million, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said today.  Gasoline stockpiles slipped 676,000 barrels to 208.8
million, the report showed.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Analysts expect the government report to show stockpiles of
crude oil increased over the period. Supplies probably advanced
1.7 million barrels, according to the median of 15 responses in
a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline inventories increased 950,000
barrels, the survey showed.  Oil-supply totals from the API and DOE have moved in the
same direction 75 percent of the time over the past four years.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for June delivery rose 8 cents to $97.45 a barrel
at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract traded at $97.14 before release of the
report at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
