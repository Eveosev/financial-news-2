Philippine three-year bonds fell,
pushing yields to a seven-week high, after a government debt
auction failed amid speculation borrowing costs will need to be
raised to rein in inflation.  The government rejected all bids for 182-day and 364-day
bills yesterday, the first time it has done so since March 15.
The Bureau of the Treasury sold 1.4 billion pesos ($32 million)
of 91-day notes at 1.889 percent, compared with a record low
0.568 percent at an auction on May 2. Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas raised its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage
point to 4.50 percent on May 5, the second increase this year.  “People are asking for higher yields because they’re
cautious on inflation expectations,” said Angeline Sia, a
fixed-income trader who helps manage the equivalent of $12
billion at BPI Asset Management Inc. in  Manila . “Some are
saying the central bank will need to hike again.”  The yield on the 6.25 percent note due January 2014 rose
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 5.09 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services. That is the highest
since March 24.  Consumer prices rose 4.5 percent in April from a year
earlier, the most in a year, data showed May 5. Policy makers
will gauge whether this year’s interest-rate increases have
anchored price expectations enough to ensure inflation targets
are met, central bank Assistant Governor Cyd Amador said on May
13. The monetary authority next meets to review its benchmark
rate on June 16.  The peso was little changed at 43.293 per dollar as of the
4 p.m. close in Manila, from 43.295 yesterday, according to
Tullett Prebon Plc. It fell by as much as 0.2 percent to 43.385
earlier.  To contact the reporter for this story:
