Jordan’s largest opposition party,
the Islamic Action Front, said the government’s push to join the
 Gulf Cooperation Council  may be aimed at avoiding introducing
changes demanded by protesters.  “We warn that this may be for security considerations to
confront the popular action demanding reform and to engage in
regional conflicts to serve the interests of major powers which
are seeking to protect their interests in the region,” the
party said in a statement posted on its  website  today.  The Front, which is the political arm of the Muslim
Brotherhood, and other groups have led street protests to demand
more freedoms since the start of the year. They do not seek
regime change. The protests came amid regional unrest that has
unseated the longstanding leaders of Egypt and  Tunisia , and
triggered an armed conflict in  Libya .  The  GCC  said on May 10 that it may admit Jordan and
Morocco, two Arab kingdoms, into the six-member group. GCC
monarchies led by  Saudi Arabia  sent troops into Bahrain in March
to help the government there contain a popular movement for
democracy and civil rights.  To contact the reporters on this story:
