Cyprus’s fiscal deficit in the first
four months of the year more than doubled to 2.1 percent of
economic output, from 0.9 percent a year earlier, mainly because
of higher spending, the  Ministry of Finance  said in a  statement 
on its website today.  The deficit in cash terms widened to 384.1 million euros
($545 million) from 154.7 million euros in the year-earlier
period, the ministry said .  Public spending rose 9.9 percent, to 2.3 billion euros,
while overall revenue fell 1 percent to 1.9 billion euros,
according to the statement. The island’s primary deficit, which
doesn’t include debt-interest payments, rose to 192.1 million
euros from 33.2 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
