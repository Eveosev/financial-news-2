Sugar rose for a fourth day in  New
York , the longest streak in more than three months, on
speculation plunging output in top producer  Brazil  may help
reduce the world surplus. Cocoa fell.  Output in Brazil’s main producing region fell 69 percent to
795,000 metric tons between the start of the harvest in mid-
March and the end of April, industry group Unica said May 12.
Global sugar production will exceed demand by 779,000 tons for
the 2010-11 season that started in October, the  International
Sugar Organization  estimated the next day.  “The tight spot supply situation in Brazil is acting as a
counterweight to the expected onslaught of world sugar supplies
in the second half of the year,” Luis Rangel, vice president of
commodity derivatives at ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey City ,  New
Jersey , wrote in a report e-mailed today.  Raw sugar for July delivery rose 0.12 cent, or 0.6 percent,
to 21.89 cents a pound by 7:56 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. That is the fourth consecutive gain for that contract, the
longest gain since Feb. 2. White, or refined, sugar for August
delivery climbed $6.90, or 1.1 percent, to $613.90 a ton on NYSE
Liffe in London.  Demand has increased as buyers seek to rebuild stocks,
Heloisa Lee Burnquist, an analyst at Cepea, a University of Sao
Paulo research group, said in a note yesterday. “An apparent
increase in the demand prevented prices from dropping,” she
said.  Rising Production  Sugar production is expected to “increase rapidly as we
move through May, which should see increased domestic and export
availability,” broker C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd. said in a
report e-mailed on May 13.  Mills have stepped up sugar production as the harvest
advances, reducing prices for crystal sugar in the Brazilian
domestic market, according to Burnquist. Still, the price of
crystal sugar within Brazil remains 18 percent more profitable
than exports, she wrote in the note.  Cocoa for July delivery slipped $7 to $2,999 a ton on ICE.
Cocoa for July delivery fell 14 pounds, or 0.8 percent, to 1,855
pounds ($3,015) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Arabica coffee for July delivery was little changed at
$2.6395 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for July delivery
dropped $6, or 0.2 percent, to $2,467 a ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
