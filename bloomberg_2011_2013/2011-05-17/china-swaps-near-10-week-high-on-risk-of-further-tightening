China ’s one-year swap rate was near a
10-week high on speculation further monetary tightening is
planned after this year’s fifth increase in reserve-ratio
requirements takes effect tomorrow. The yuan was little changed.  Major lenders’ reserve ratios will rise to 21 percent
tomorrow, from 20.5 percent, and that’s curbing the availability
of cash in the financial system. In addition to reining in
lending, policy makers have also increased benchmark  interest
rates  twice this year to help tame the fastest inflation in
almost three years. Consumer-price gains of 5.4 percent in March
and 5.3 percent in April were the biggest since July 2008 and
exceed the government’s goal of limiting increases to 4 percent.  “The impact of the latest reserve-ratio hike is already
priced in, but we expect more tightening to come,” said  Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
Cheung. “It’s not likely that inflation will ease until the
third quarter.”  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost to receive the
seven-day repurchase rate, was 3.48 percent as of 5:24 p.m. in
Shanghai, compared with 3.49 percent yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s climbed 11 basis points in the
past month and yesterday’s closing level was the highest since
March 8. A further increase in reserve ratios may drive the swap
rate to 3.77 percent in the next two months, Cheung said.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures funding
availability between banks, fell seven basis points to 4.59
percent in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Yuan Consolidation  The yuan closed at 6.5060 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. in
Shanghai, 0.02 percent stronger than yesterday, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency reached 6.4892
on April 29, the strongest level since 1993. It isn’t allowed to
move more than 0.5 percent either side of the central bank’s
daily fixing, which was set 0.03 percent weaker at 6.5108 today.  “It’s a day of consolidation for the yuan and yuan
forwards after the sell-off yesterday,” Cheung said. The
currency weakened 0.15 percent yesterday, the most in three
weeks, and 12-month non-deliverable forwards slumped 0.48
percent.  The forwards contracts gained 0.25 percent to 6.3805 per
dollar today, reflecting expectations the yuan will strengthen 2
percent from the onshore spot rate in a year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan
strengthened 0.12 percent to 6.4965.  To contact the reporter on this story:
