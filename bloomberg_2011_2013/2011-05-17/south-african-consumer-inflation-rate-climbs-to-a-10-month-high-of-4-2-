South African inflation accelerated
to 4.2 percent in April, less than economists estimated,
increasing the likelihood the central bank will keep interest
rates at a 30-year low.  The inflation rate rose from 4.1 percent in March, the
Pretoria-based statistics office said on its  website  today. The
median estimate of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for
the rate to increase to 4.4 percent. Prices advanced 0.3 percent
in the month.  The central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged
at 5.5 percent last week to help support the recovery in
 Africa ’s biggest economy, while warning that price pressures
were intensifying. Governor Gill Marcus said on May 12 inflation
will probably average 5.1 percent this year and 6 percent in
2012, with a breach of the 3 percent to 6 percent target range
in the first quarter of next year likely to be temporary.  “There is very little demand-led inflation,” Gina Schoeman, an economist at Absa Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said
in a phone interview today. “ Core inflation , which excludes
food and beverages, is still at a very muted 3.1 percent. We
maintain that the  Reserve Bank  will only start to raise interest
rates in January 2012.”  The rand was at 7.0003 against the dollar as of 10:30 a.m.
in Johannesburg from 6.9918 before the data was released. The
yield on the R157 government bond, due 2015, fell 3 basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.69 percent.  Pressure Eases  Today’s report “shows that there is very little demand in
the economy,” Ian Cruickshanks, head of Treasury strategic
research at Johannesburg-based Nedbank Capital, said by phone
today. “It may mean that we don’t get a rate hike until the
first quarter of 2012. It certainly eases pressure on the
central bank in the short term.”  The central bank forecasts that inflation will peak at 6.3
percent in the first three months of next year, before dropping
back into the target range by the second quarter and remaining
close to the upper limit for the rest of the year.  “The underlying inflation pressures are mainly of a cost-
push nature,” Marcus said last week. “These pressures have the
real potential to generate second-round effects, which can
result in more generalized inflation.”  Oil prices  surged 6.8 percent last month, after adding 10.1
percent in March, on concern that unrest in North Africa and the
Middle East would disrupt supplies as the global economy
recovers. The government boosted gasoline prices by 2.9 percent
this month and 5.7 percent in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
