Serbia ’s government plans to reduce
payment times for state contractors and other businesses in a
bid to stem the growth of overdue loans, Premier  Mirko Cvetkovic 
said.  “This, plus possibly a grace period in repaying bank
loans, can help halt a further increase in non-performing
loans,” he told a conference today in Belgrade.  Payment times will be trimmed to 60 days to help improve
liquidity in the private sector, Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric
said after a meeting with the head of Serbia’s Chamber of
Commerce, Milos Bugarin, in Belgrade today. Bugarin said
payments currently take an average of 130 days.  Overdue loans are likely to be high on the agenda of the
so-called Serbian Corporate Parliament’s first session on June
3, where 250 business executives will discuss ways to improve
the business environment with government officials and party
leaders.  “Non-performing loans continue to rise and unemployment is
high, but unemployment is the top political issue,” Cvetkovic
said.  The number of employed workers didn’t fall in March for the
first time since the global economic crisis started, he said,
adding that it’s “too early to say whether this constitutes a
trend.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
