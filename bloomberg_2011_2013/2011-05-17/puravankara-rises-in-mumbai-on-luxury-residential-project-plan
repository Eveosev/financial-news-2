Puravankara Projects Ltd. (PVKP)  rallied,
snapping a three-day loss, after the Indian real-estate
developer said it plans to start marketing a luxury residential
project in Bangalore.  The stock jumped 3.7 percent to 105.8 rupees at 2:40 p.m.
in Mumbai. It was the biggest gainer on the BSE Mid-Cap Index.
More than 1.8 million shares changed hands, about 25 times the
three-month daily average, according to the data compiled by
Bloomberg. Puravankara plans to offer about 1.24 million square
feet of luxury apartments in Bangalore “in a month or two,”
said Hari Ramakrishnan, head of investment relations.  “The stock is buoyant on buzz in market that the company
will launch some project in Bangalore,” said Riddhi Shah, an
analyst at Magnum Equity Broking Ltd. in Mumbai.  Puravankara is “working on the pricing” of the project
and is waiting for the necessary approvals before starting
sales, Ramakrishnan said on the phone today from his office in
Bangalore. The company has already started marketing a luxury
residential project in Coimbatore in the southern state of  Tamil
Nadu  and expects it to add 6.5 billion rupees to its sales,
according to an exchange filing on May 11.  To contact the reporters on this story:
