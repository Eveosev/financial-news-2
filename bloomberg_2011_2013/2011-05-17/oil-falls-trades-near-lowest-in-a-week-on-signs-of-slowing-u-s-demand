Oil declined for a second day in  New
York  amid signs of faltering U.S. demand and accumulating crude
supplies in the world’s biggest consumer of crude.  Oil dropped as much as 1.1 percent in New York after a
report showed housing starts unexpectedly fell in the U.S. last
month, raising doubts about a recovery in U.S. demand. An Energy
Department report tomorrow may show U.S. crude inventories
climbed to a two-year high.  “Further bad news is causing oil to continue its gradual
decline,” said Alexander Ridgers, head of commodities at CMC
Markets in London, which trades more than $400 million of
crude oil a day.  Crude for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
fell as much as $1.08 to $96.29 a barrel and was at $96.37 at
1:55 p.m.  London  time. It fell 2.3 percent yesterday to $97.37,
the lowest settlement since May 6. Prices have risen 38 percent
in the past year.  Brent oil for July settlement was at $109.99 a barrel, down
85 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
June contract expired yesterday, losing $1.10 to $112.73.  Housings starts in the U.S. unexpectedly fell in April as
home builders continued to struggle almost two years into an
economic recovery. Work began on 523,000 houses at an annual
pace, down 11 percent from the prior month and less than the
569,000 median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
 Washington . Building permits, a sign of future construction,
also decreased.  Inventory Reports  An Energy Department report tomorrow may show U.S. crude
inventories climbed 1.5 million barrels from 370.3 million
barrels, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline supplies may increase 1 million
barrels, the survey shows. The industry-funded  American
Petroleum Institute  publishes its weekly supply report today.  Chinese oil demand growth may slow this year, according to
an official at a unit of the nation’s biggest crude producer.
Demand may rise 6.7 percent, slowing from 9.6 percent growth in
2010, Zhang Fuqin, deputy chief engineer at China National
Petroleum Corp.’s petroleum and petrochemical engineering
institute, said at a conference in Tianjin today.  European finance ministers for the first time suggested
talks with bondholders on “re-profiling”  Greece ’s debt
repayments, saying last year’s 110 billion-euro ($156 billion)
rescue has failed to restore the country to financial health,
according to Juncker. His comments suggest ministers’ views are
closer to the 85 percent of international investors who, in a
Bloomberg poll last week, said Greece is likely to default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
