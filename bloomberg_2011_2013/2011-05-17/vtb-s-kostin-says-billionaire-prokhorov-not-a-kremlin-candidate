(Corrects to remove reference to Igor Petrov, who is no
longer a spokesman for Onexim Group, in a story originally
published May 17.)  Billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov is
unlikely to run in presidential elections next March and
investors should expect a predictable vote, Andrey Kostin, chief
executive officer of state-controlled VTB Group, said.  “I don’t think Prokhorov will be a candidate for the
presidency, seriously,” Kostin said today in an interview with
Bloomberg in  London . “I would not worry about this.”  Russia’s third-richest man will pursue the chairmanship of
Pravoye Delo, or Right Cause, and plans to consider whether to
run for president sometime after the party’s annual meeting
later this year, Prokhorov said yesterday. President  Dmitry Medvedev  and Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  have said they will
decide together who will run in the election, and neither has
ruled out a bid.  “There’s a lot of predictability in the Russian
elections,” Kostin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
