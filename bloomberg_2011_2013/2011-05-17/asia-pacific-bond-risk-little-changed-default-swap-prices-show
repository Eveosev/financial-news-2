The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default was little changed,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was at 108 basis points as of 8:53 a.m.
in  Hong Kong , according to Credit Agricole CIB.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 108
basis points as of 10:53 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices
show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was at 122.5 basis points as
of 10:01 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
