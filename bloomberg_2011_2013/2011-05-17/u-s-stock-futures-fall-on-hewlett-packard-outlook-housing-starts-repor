Stock-index futures signaled a third
day of losses for U.S. equities after  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) 
lowered its profit forecast and housing starts unexpectedly fell
in April, damping optimism about the economic outlook.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in June lost
0.1 percent to 1,323.9 at 8:36 a.m. in New York. Futures on the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 22 points, or 0.2 percent,
to 12,487.  Work began on 523,000 houses at an annual pace, down 11
percent from the prior month and less than the 569,000 median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, figures from
the Commerce Department showed. Building permits, a sign of
future construction, also decreased.  The  S&P 500  has fallen in the past two weeks as investors
grow more concerned that  Greece  may have to restructure its
debt. Still, analysts have raised full-year earnings estimates
in the index by 2.2 percent since April as more than two thirds
of companies that reported earnings beat projections.  European finance ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday
floated the idea of talks with bondholders over extending
Greece’s debt-repayment schedule for the first time, saying that
last year’s 110 billion-euro ($156 billion) rescue has failed to
restore the country to financial health.
Europe would consider “reprofiling” Greek bond maturities as
part of a package including stepped-up sales of state assets and
deeper spending cuts, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude
Juncker said late yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
