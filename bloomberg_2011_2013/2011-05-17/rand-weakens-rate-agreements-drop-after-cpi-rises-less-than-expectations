The rand weakened against the dollar,
forward-rate agreements snapped five days of gains and bonds
rose as inflation quickened less than expected and retail sales
slowed, fueling bets rates will be kept on hold.  The rand declined as much as 0.8 percent to 7.0391 per
dollar, and traded 0.3 percent weaker at 7.0027 at 4 p.m. in
Johannesburg. It slipped 0.1 percent to 9.9203 per euro.
Forward-rate agreements due in September, which investors use to
lock in borrowing costs, fell the most since Jan. 19, losing 14
basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 5.76 percent.  The consumer inflation rate rose to 4.2 percent in April,
the highest since June, from 4.1 percent in March, the Pretoria-
based statistics office said on its website today. The median
estimate of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for the rate
to increase to 4.4 percent. Retail sales growth slowed for the
third consecutive month, undermining a recovery in  Africa ’s
biggest economy.  “All these numbers are telling us consumption is not
picking up,” Victor Mphaphuli, who helps oversee about 165
billion rand ($23.5 billion) of fixed-interest investments at
Stanlib Asset Management, said by phone from Johannesburg. “It
should give the central bank some comfort in terms of keeping
rates on hold.”  The Pretoria-based central bank left its benchmark interest
rate unchanged at 5.5 percent on May 12, while warning that
price pressures were intensifying. The bank expects inflation to
average 5.1 percent this year and 6 percent in 2012. Two months
ago, it forecast inflation of 4.7 percent and 5.7 percent for
the two years, respectively.  Housing Starts  “It certainly eases pressure on the central bank in the
short term,” Ian Cruickshanks, head of treasury strategic
research at Johannesburg-based Nedbank Capital, a unit of  South
Africa ’s fourth-biggest bank, said by phone. “It may mean that
we don’t get a rate hike until the first quarter of 2012.”  The rand extended its decline after housing starts in the
U.S. unexpectedly fell in April and industrial output stalled,
casting doubt over the pace of a recovery of the world’s biggest
economy and prompting investors to sell risky assets.  “The data out of the U.S. is negative for emerging
markets, negative for the world economy,” Mphaphuli said.
“You’re seeing a flight to safety. There is a lot of demand for
dollars.”  The 13.5 percent government bonds due 2015 gained 16 cents
to 121.01, driving the yield down five basis points to 7.67
percent. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 climbed 77 cents
to 88.70 rand, pushing the yield 13 basis points lower to 8.46
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
