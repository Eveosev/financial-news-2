European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said the euro is “too strong” compared with the yuan,
and that  Europe  is an attractive investment market for  China 
after taking “strict” measures to address its debt crisis.  “The euro is the world’s second reserve currency and a
strong and stable currency -- even too strong, compared for
instance to your currency,”  Van Rompuy  said today in a speech
in Beijing. Europe “is the world’s largest market, the biggest
export market for China, and clearly a good place to invest.”  Van Rompuy said that while the EU’s problems “aren’t over
yet,” policy makers are making “good progress.”  European finance chiefs yesterday endorsed a 78 billion-
euro ($111 billion) bailout for Portugal and stepped up pressure
on Greece to do more to win improved aid terms. Portugal
followed Greece and Ireland in seeking emergency loans from the
EU and the  International Monetary Fund , bringing to 256 billion
euros the aid provided to stamp out the sovereign debt crisis.  Europe and the U.S. have criticized China’s yuan peg to the
dollar, saying it gives Chinese exports an unfair advantage
because the currency is kept artificially low. The Chinese
currency has risen 8.9 percent this year against the euro.  "China is investing in the euro zone, and it is evidence of
their confidence," Van Rompuy said. "We are grateful for that
confidence."  To contact the reporter on this story:
