Ukrzernoprom Agro , a Ukrainian unit
of MCB Agricole Holding AG, increased its sowing of spring
grains and oilseeds by 32 percent.  The crops were seeded on 33,000 hectares (81,544 acres), up
from 25,000 hectares a year earlier, the Kiev-based company said
on its website. Spring planting was completed as of today and
seeding was optimal for all crops, it said.  Sunflowers were planted on 12,857 hectares, and sowing of
corn almost doubled to 7,103 hectares from 3,743 hectares last
year, said Ukrzernoprom, which operates in 12 Ukrainian regions.  Producing wheat in Ukraine costs half as much as in the
European Union on average, and Ukrainian labor and land-leasing
expenses are among the worldâ€™s lowest, according to a management
presentation in March by Vienna-based MCB Agricole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
