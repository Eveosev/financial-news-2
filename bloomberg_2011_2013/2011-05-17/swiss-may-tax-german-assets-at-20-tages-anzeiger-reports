A deal between the Swiss and German
governments could see a withholding tax on current German-owned
assets in  Switzerland  set at about 20 percent, Tages-Anzeiger
reported, without saying where it got the information.  A future capital gains tax on German assets in Switzerland
is likely to be set at 26 percent, the Swiss paper said today,
adding that  Germany  could expect inflows of between 20 billion
and 40 billion Swiss francs as a result of the pending
agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
