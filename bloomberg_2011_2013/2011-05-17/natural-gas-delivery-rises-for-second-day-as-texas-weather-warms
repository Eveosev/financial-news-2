Natural gas shipments to U.S. power
plants rose for a second day as Texas was forecast to emerge
from a spell of weather cooler than normal, increasing demand
for the power-plant fuel.  A sample of scheduled gas shipments for U.S. electricity
generation gained 1.5 percent to 12.4 million dekatherms (12.1
billion cubic feet) from yesterdayâ€™s 12.2 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg as of 9:15 a.m. in  New York .  Gas deliveries to Texas power plants increased 21.1 percent
to 2.24 million dekatherms from 1.86 million, the data showed.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at the Texas Zone 1
increased 2.9 percent to $4.138 per million British thermal
units yesterday on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, advanced 2.8
percent to $4.2093. The hub is the benchmark for gas futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The temperature in Houston was 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28
Celsius) on May 14, 3 degrees below normal and is forecast to
rise to 88 on May 19, 2 degrees above normal, according to
 Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan.  Gas deliveries for residential use across the U.S. fell for
the second day, by 3.4 percent to 25.25 dekatherms from 26.13
dekatherms yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
