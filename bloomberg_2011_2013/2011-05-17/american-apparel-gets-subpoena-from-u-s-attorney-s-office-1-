American Apparel Inc. (APP) , a clothing
retailer, said it received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s
Office for the Central District of  California  for documents
relating to a complaint filed by a former employee with the
Occupational Safety & Health Administration in November 2010.
The information was disclosed in a regulatory filing.  The complaint contains allegations regarding American
Apparel’s policies with regards to foreign currency transactions
and transfer pricing, according to the filing.  “The company intends to fully cooperate with this
subpoena,” American Apparel said in the filing.  American Apparel said it is involved in other employment-
related claims and management “believes that all such claims
against the company are without merit.”  The clothing retailer last month said it raised $14.9
million by selling stock to investors including founder and
Chief Executive Officer Dov Charney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
