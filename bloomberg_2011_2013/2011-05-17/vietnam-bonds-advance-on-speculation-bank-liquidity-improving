Vietnam ’s government bonds advanced
on speculation banks have more funds to buy dong-denominated
debt. The dong slid the most in three months.  “Liquidity among banks has improved since the central bank
injected more dong funds to the banking system as it bought a
large amount of U.S. dollars,” said Hoang Moc Tung, a currency
trader at Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and  Rural Development .
“The central bank may have bought up to $1 billion this month,”
he said.  The yield on the benchmark five-year notes fell 11 basis
points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 12.65 percent as of 5:39
p.m. in Hanoi, according to a daily fixing price from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The dong weakened 0.7 percent, the most
since Feb. 17, to 20,770 per dollar, according to prices from
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set the dong’s daily reference
rate at 20,673, compared with 20,678 yesterday. The currency is
allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on either side of
the fixing.  The central bank raised the repurchase rate by a percentage
point to 15 percent, effective today, according to an e-mail
from the monetary authority. It was the second increase this
month.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Sandy Hendry  To contact the reporter on this story:
