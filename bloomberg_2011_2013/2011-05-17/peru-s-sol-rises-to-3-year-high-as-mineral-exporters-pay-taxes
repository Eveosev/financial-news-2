Peru ’s sol rose to its highest level
in three years as the country’s mineral exporters sold dollars
to pay local taxes.  The currency rose 0.1 percent to 2.7571 per U.S. dollar at
5:02 p.m. New York time, from 2.7595 yesterday, ending at the
strongest level since May 2008.  Peruvian exporters, led by copper and gold producers, are
buying soles to pay income taxes before a May 25 deadline, said
 Mario Guerrero , an economist at Scotiabank Peru in Lima.
Overseas sales of copper and gold, the country’s top exports,
climbed to records in March on surging prices, the nation’s
central bank said today.  The central bank didn’t buy or sell dollars in the foreign
exchange market today, it said on its website.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 was unchanged at 6.75 percent, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
