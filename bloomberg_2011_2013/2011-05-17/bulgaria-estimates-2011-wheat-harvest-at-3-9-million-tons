Bulgaria expects to harvest 3.9
million metric tons of wheat this year, as the area sown with
the crop is less than in 2010.  Bulgarian farmers have sown 2.58 million acres (1.04
million hectares) with wheat, down from 2.78 million acres last
year, when the harvest was 4 million tons, the  Agriculture
Ministry  said in a statement yesterday.  The country has sown 445,000 acres with barley, compared
with 625,000 acres last year, when the crop was 830,000 tons,
the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
