Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said he isn’t “at all” thinking about calling an
election. He made the comments at a weekly press briefing in
Copenhagen today.  Local media have speculated Rasmussen may call an early
vote after his government on May 13 struck a pension reform
accord with the opposition Social Liberals and the coalition’s
parliamentary ally, the Danish  People’s Party .  The Liberal-Conservative minority coalition term’s is due
to end in November.  “I know there are lots of people who are interested in the
question of whether there’ll be an election, but there won’t be
one now,” Rasmussen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
