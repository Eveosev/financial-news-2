Permits to discharge carbon dioxide
under the European Union emissions-trading system declined as
German power prices fell, curbing the incentive to hedge in the
forward markets.  EU permits for delivery in December decreased 0.4 percent
to 16.83 euros ($23.82) a metric ton as of 9:23 a.m. on  London ’s
ICE Futures Europe exchange. They earlier dropped as much as 0.7
percent to 16.77 euros.  German baseload power for next year, a European benchmark,
slipped 0.1 percent to 59.10 euros a megawatt-hour, after
falling as low as 58.90 euros, according to broker prices on
Bloomberg. The contract is up 10 percent this year following
Germany’s decision to shut the oldest reactors for a safety
review after the nuclear crisis in  Japan .  Lower power prices can weaken the incentive to sell
electricity forward, easing demand for CO2 permits. The EU
emissions trading system imposes discharge limits on more than
11,000  power plants  and manufacturing companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
