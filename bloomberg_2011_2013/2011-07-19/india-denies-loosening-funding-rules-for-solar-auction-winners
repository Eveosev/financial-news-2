India ’s government denied a report
in the country’s Economic Times that it would ease funding rules
for companies who won licenses to set up solar power projects.  “We’ve not changed anything,” said Tarun Kapoor, a joint
secretary at the Ministry of New and  Renewable Energy  overseeing
India’s Solar Mission program. “The rules remain the same.”  The country awarded licenses for 620 megawatts of solar
projects to companies such as billionaire Anil Ambani’s  Reliance
Power Ltd. (RPWR)  and  Lanco Infratech Ltd. (LANCI)  in an auction in December.
The government is considering allowing developers to keep their
licenses even if they miss a deadline for demonstrating their
ability to fund the projects, India’s Economic Times said today.  Companies without funding would forfeit their permits and
bank guarantees of as much as 1.8 billion rupees ($40 million),
according to current rules. More than 30 submissions for the 37
projects were received as of yesterday, before a deadline of
July 24, Kapoor said in a telephone interview from  New Delhi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
