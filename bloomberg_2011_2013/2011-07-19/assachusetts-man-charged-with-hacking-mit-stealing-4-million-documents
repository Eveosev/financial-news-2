A Cambridge, Massachusetts, man was
charged by the U.S. with hacking into Massachusetts Institute of
Technology’s computer network and stealing more than 4 million
documents.  Aaron Swartz, 24, was indicted on six counts including  wire
fraud  and obtaining information from a protected computer,
according to a statement today from the U.S. attorney’s office
in  Boston . He faces as long as 35 years in prison and a fine of
as much as $1 million if convicted.  Swartz, a former fellow at the Harvard University Center
for Ethics, hacked into MIT computers to access JSTOR, a
database of more than 1,000 academic journals, and downloaded
more than 4.8 million articles, according to the indictment.  Swartz, a former fellow at the Harvard University Center
for Ethics, hacked into MIT’S online archive of academic
journals and illegally downloaded 4.8 million articles from
JSTOR, a nonprofit provider of more than 1,000 academic journals
on the Internet, according to the indictment.  Swartz planned to distribute “a significant proportion of
JSTOR’s archive through one or more file-sharing sites,” the
indictment said.  The suspect was a co-founder of the social networking and
news site Reddit.com, according to a post on that website. He is
no longer with Reddit.com.  A message seeking comment left at a telephone number
belonging to an Aaron Swartz in Cambridge wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
