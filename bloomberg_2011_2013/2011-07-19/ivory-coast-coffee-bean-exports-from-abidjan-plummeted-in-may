Exports of coffee beans from  Ivory
Coast ’s port of Abidjan, the commercial capital, dropped 88
percent in May, according to data from the harbor.  Shipments were 1,266 metric tons, compared with 10,873 tons
in the same period a year earlier, according to statistics
obtained at the port yesterday.  Exports of soluble coffee, produced in Abidjan, rose to
