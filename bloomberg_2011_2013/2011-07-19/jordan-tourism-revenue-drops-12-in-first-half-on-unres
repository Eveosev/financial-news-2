Jordanian tourism revenue dropped 12
percent in the first half of 2011 from a year earlier because of
regional turmoil, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said.  Revenue decreased to 949 million dinars ($1.34 billion) in
the first six months of the year from 1.089 billion dinars
during the same period of 2010, it said in an e-mailed
statement.  The number of visitors dropped 14.2 percent during the
first half of 2011 to 3.124 million from 3.639 million during
the same period last year, it said.  Protests, some of them violent, have been taking place in
 Jordan  since the start of the year amid regional revolts that
ousted the longstanding leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt , and led to
conflict in Libya, Syria and Yemen.  Tourism revenue makes up about 14 percent of gross domestic
product in Jordan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
