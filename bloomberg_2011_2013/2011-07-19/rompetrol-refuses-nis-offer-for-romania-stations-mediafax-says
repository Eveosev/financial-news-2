Oil refiner Rompetrol Group NV
declined an offer by  Serbia ’s Naftna Industrija Srbije AD to buy
its Romanian gas station network, Mediafax reported.  OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of  Russia ’s state-controlled
gas producer that owns 51 percent of NIS, sent an offer two
months ago to acquire Rompetrol’s network of 450 gas stations,
the Bucharest-based  news service  reported, citing Rompetrol
Chief Executive Officer Saduokhas Meraliyev.  Meraliyev declined to disclose the value of the offer, the
news service said. Rompetrol’s network is valued at 500 million
euros ($709 million) to 600 million euros, Mediafax said, citing
Titov Buzescu, the group’s vice-president for retail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
