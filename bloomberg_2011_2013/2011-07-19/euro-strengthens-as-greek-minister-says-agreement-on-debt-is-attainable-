The dollar advanced versus the yen
for the first time in three days as President  Barack Obama 
endorsed a deficit-cutting proposal by a bipartisan group of
senators.  The U.S. currency erased its drop against the euro as Obama
called the revival of the so-called Gang of Six proposal “good
news” that may help move negotiations on the deficit and raising
the federal debt ceiling.  “The talk of the Gang of Six coming together and maybe
helping facilitate some agreement on the debt ceiling, possible
fiscal adjustments, that’s really been the catalyst for this
move,” said  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group of 10 currency
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York “It’s a squeeze of any
dollar short positions. The dollar is coming back across the
board.”  The dollar appreciated 0.1 percent to 79.14 yen at 2:29
p.m. in  New York , from 79.04 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
