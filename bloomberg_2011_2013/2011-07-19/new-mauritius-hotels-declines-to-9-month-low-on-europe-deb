New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the
country’s largest leisure operator by market value, dropped to
its lowest in nine months on speculation the European debt
crisis will affect tourism and the company’s revenue.  The stock retreated for a third day, falling 0.5 rupees, or
0.5 percent, to 99.50 rupees a share, the lowest intraday level
since Sept. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “NMH fell below the psychological level of 100 rupees,
driven by the debt concerns in  Europe , its main tourist market,
which might impact on the group’s revenue in the short term,”
Kishen Nadassen, a senior research analyst at the Port Louis-
based Cim Stockbrokers Ltd., said by phone today from the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
