European Union authorities gathering
on July 21 to discuss a second rescue for  Greece  have a “menu
of options” from the International Institute of Finance
providing tools to involve private investors, said Francois Perol, head of the French Banking Federation.  “All possible and imaginable technical tools are on the
table,” Perol said at a meeting with reporters in Paris today.
“Some might be interested by forms of buyback, others by
renewal formulas,” he said, declining to give further details.  The set of proposals from the Washington-based IIF, backed
by the French banks’ industry group, is “broader” than a plan
put forward by French lenders, Perol said. French banks proposed
a plan last month to roll over 70 percent of bonds maturing by
mid-2014 into new 30-year Greek securities backed by AAA-rated
collateral.  “All French banks will be involved if there’s an
involvement of the private sector, on a voluntary basis,” Perol
said, declining to say what option the French banks prefer or
how the original plan has been changed.  Officials from the  European Central Bank , the European
Commission and the banks renewed their talks in  Rome  on July 15
on involving private investors in a second rescue plan for
Greece. The Rome discussions were organized by the IIF, a trade
association representing more than 400 banks and insurers, and
chaired by  Vittorio Grilli , the head of the EU’s Economic and
Financial Committee.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
