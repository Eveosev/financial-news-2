Victoria Oil & Gas Plc (VOG) , the U.K.-
based explorer that plans to produce its first onshore gas in
the first quarter, said it has “plenty of cash” to complete
the project.  The company needs additional funding of $10 million to
complete the Logbaba field after increasing its stake to 95
percent, Chairman Kevin Foo told reporters today in  London .  Victoria Oil raised its holding from 57 percent after RSM
Production Corp., its partner in Cameroon, failed to fund its
share, the London-based company said today in a statement.  “We have plenty of cash to complete the job,” Foo said.
Victoria Oil will get “roughly a quarter of a billion” dollars
in value from taking over RSM’s share.  Victoria Oil plans to supply about 8 million cubic feet a
day of gas next year to customers including the local units of
 Nestle SA (NESN) ,  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  and  Diageo Plc (DGE)  amongst others.  The company expects to increase output to 44 million cubic
feet a day in 2014 and to as much as 200 million a day in 2018,
depending on further field exploration and local demand.  The company isn’t interested in providing supplies for the
 GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA-led liquefied natural-gas project in Cameroon, Foo
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
