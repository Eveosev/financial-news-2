Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds
jumped, while German bunds fell for the first time in four days
as stock markets rallied amid speculation European leaders will
move closer to resolving the region’s debt crisis.  The gains sent Italian 10-year yields down by the most
since May 2010, even as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
 Europe ’s debt crisis can’t be fixed “in one step.” Spanish
debt snapped a three-day decline as the government sold bills at
an auction. Greek notes plunged as European Central Bank council
member  Ewald Nowotny  said the ECB’s aim is to “avoid any
situation” that would make it impossible for the ECB to
continue to accept Greek bonds as collateral. The Stoxx Europe
600 Index rose 0.8 percent.  “Investors are less pessimistic about the outcome for
Thursday’s summit and think there might be potential for
compromise,” said Niels From, chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB
in Copenhagen. “We see equities up, some peripheral bonds
rising and bunds down. It’s a broad-based move. We had very
negative markets yesterday and there is a bit of a correction.”  Spain ’s 10-year bond yields fell 24 basis points to 6.08
percent at 4:25 p.m. in London. The yield reached a euro-era
record of 6.37 percent yesterday. The 5.5 percent security
maturing in April 2021 rose 1.63, or 16.30 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,419) face amount, to 95.780. Two-year note yields slid as
much as 29 basis points to 4.27 percent, the biggest intraday
drop since December.  Spanish Auction  Spain sold 4.45 billion euros of 12- and 18-month bills,
below the maximum objective of 4.5 billion euros. The Treasury
in  Madrid  auctioned 3.79 billion euros of 364-day securities at
an average yield of 3.702 percent, up from 2.695 percent the
last time the securities were sold on June 14. It also issued
661 million euros of 511-day debt at an average yield of 3.912
percent, higher than the 3.26 percent result last month.  Greece  sold 1.625 billion euros of 13-week bills at a
uniform yield of 4.58 percent, the debt agency said.  The euro strengthened 0.4 percent to $1.4171 and the yield
on the 10-year German bund, the region’s benchmark government
debt security, increased three basis points to 2.68 percent.  The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose one basis point to
2.94 percent.  European Union leaders are preparing for a summit in two
days to hammer out a solution to the Greek debt crisis, which
spread to Ireland and Portugal and threatens Italy and Spain.  ‘Political Responsibility’  “Those who want to take political responsibility, and
that’s what the government wants and takes seriously, know that
responsibly there won’t be one spectacular step” this week,
Merkel told reporters in Hanover,  Germany , today. “It’s
entirely about creating a controlled, composed process of
gradual steps and measures.”  While Germany wants private investors to participate in a
second bailout package for Greece, ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  has said policy makers won’t accept Greek  government
bonds  as collateral for loans in the event of a default or
“credit event.”  Nowotny said on CNBC earlier today that it’s up to the ECB
to decide what collateral it accepts and it “should not be
totally dependent on rating agencies.”  “This increases the chances of an agreement at Thursday’s
emergency EU summit,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh, a broker
for banks.  Greek Notes Tumble  French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said yesterday that
he was “confident” that an agreement on Greece would be
reached that would satisfy the ECB.  Greek two-year yields surged as much as 326 basis points to
39.24 percent, while the nation’s 10-year bond yields declined
18 basis points to 18.03 percent. Ireland’s two-year note yields
reached a euro-era record of 23.50 percent, while  Portugal ’s
climbed to 20.42 percent, also a record.  “On the Greek two-year, the market is speculating ahead of
Thursday’s meeting if there will be a haircut, if a haircut will
be agreed to and what size it will be,” said Norbert Aul, a
European rates strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in London.  Ten-year bund yields reached 2.62 yesterday, the least
since July 12, when they dropped to 2.50 percent. Yields on
German two-year notes were six basis points higher at 1.25
percent. They were at 1.05 percent on July 12, the least since
Jan. 13.  Auction Demand  Italy’s 10-year yields tumbled 26 basis points to 5.71, the
biggest intra-day decline since May 10, 2010. The yield
difference, or spread, between the securities and similar-
maturity bunds narrowed to 3.04 percentage points, or 304 basis
points.  Demand for the Spanish 12-month bills today was 2.18 times
the amount of securities sold, compared with 2.85 last month,
and the bid-to-cover for the longer-maturity debt was 5.49
times, compared with 3.91.  “Over the near term, the low size range of the Spanish
auction may be a supportive factor,” Aul said. “Spain will
have to increase their auction sizes again going forward, and
eventually issue a new 10-year, and that poses a risk,” because
yields are at relatively high levels, he said.  German government bonds handed investors 2.5 percent this
year, compared with 3.6 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 4.1
percent for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Greek bonds lost more than 23 percent, while Spain’s
declined 1.6 percent and Italian debt lost 4.4 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
