Germany  expects Swiss banks to
deliver as much as 10 billion euros ($14 billion) owed by tax
evaders under a proposed tax agreement with  Switzerland ,
Handelsblatt said, citing government officials it didn’t
identify.  Payments would be based on a tax of as much as 30 percent
on the difference between the customer’s current account balance
and the balance 10 years ago, the Dusseldorf, Germany-based
newspaper  reported  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
