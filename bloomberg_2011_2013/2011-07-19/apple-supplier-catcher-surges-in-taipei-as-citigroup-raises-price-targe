Catcher Technology Co., which makes
metal casings for  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  computers, surged to the highest in
more than four years in Taipei trading after three brokers
raised their price estimates for the stock by 22 percent.  Catcher jumped by the 7 percent daily limit to NT$224.50,
the highest close since Jan. 25, 2007. The stock, trading at a
2011 high of 17.7 times estimated profit, has more than doubled
this year, while the island’s benchmark Taiex index has fallen 5
percent.  Citigroup Inc., Macquarie Group Ltd. and Bank of America-
Merrill Lynch raised their share-price estimates for Catcher,
with Macquarie saying the stock may climb to as high as NT$304.
Catcher will probably supply parts for new  Research In Motion
Ltd. (RIMM)  models and benefit from new  Dell Inc. (DELL)  orders, according to
two of the brokers.  “Catcher has demonstrated it is ahead of the competition
by 12-16 months,” Wei Chen, a Citigroup analyst, said in a
report yesterday.  Macquarie increased its estimate for the company’s 2011
gross margin to 43 percent from 39 percent. Catcher may report a
gross margin of 40 percent, according to the median of 12
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We still think our margin assumption is conservative and
expect Catcher to beat the street significantly,” Macquarie
analysts including Daniel Chang said in a report dated
yesterday.  James Wu, a Catcher spokesman, said the company has added
two “international” clients this year, declining to specify
company names. He said he couldn’t comment on the gross margin
estimates for the year because of stock exchange regulations.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
