South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, will probably cut its forecast for
this seasonâ€™s harvest, a survey showed.  The country may say farmers will reap 10.85 million metric
tons of corn, from the 11 million metric tons estimated in June,
according to the median estimate of 12 traders Bloomberg
surveyed. Forecasts ranged from 10.7 million to 11 million tons.  The  Crop Estimates Committee  will issue a sixth assessment
of the crop on July 26 at 3:30 p.m. in Johannesburg.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, rose 2.8 percent to 1,935
rand ($279) a ton by the midday close today. Yellow corn for
September delivery gained 4.1 percent, to 1,884 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
