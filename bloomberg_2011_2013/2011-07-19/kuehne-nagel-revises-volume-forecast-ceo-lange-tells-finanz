Kuehne & Nagel International Holding
AG revised the prognosis for its volume development “somewhat
down” because of the weakening world economy, Chief Executive
Officer Reinhard Lange was cited as saying in an interview with
Finanz und Wirtschaft.  “Kuehne & Nagel will presumably also in the running year
again have an outstanding result,” Lange told the Zurich-based
newspaper in an interview to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
