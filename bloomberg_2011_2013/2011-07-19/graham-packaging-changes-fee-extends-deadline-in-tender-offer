Graham Packaging  Co., the container
maker that’s being acquired by Reynolds Group Holdings Ltd.,
changed the terms it’s offering to buy back $503.3 million of
its debt after bondholders objected to an earlier offer.  Graham Packaging increased the proposed consent fee to 2.5
cents on the dollar from 1.5 cents and extended by a day the
deadline for investors to sell their securities or agree to
covenant changes, the York, Pennsylvania-based company said
yesterday in a July 18 statement distributed by PR Newswire.  Bondholders must now tender their securities or agree to
alter a covenant that allows them to sell the debt back to
Graham Packaging at 101 cents on the dollar by 5 p.m.  New York 
time tomorrow, instead of today as initially proposed, the
company said in the statement. It cut the amount it’s offering
to pay for each bond to 98.5 cents from 99.5 cents, leaving
total compensation unchanged at 102 cents on the dollar.  A group including holders of 81 percent of Graham
Packaging’s $253.3 million of 8.25 percent notes due January
2017 and 78 percent of its $250 million of 8.25 percent debt
maturing in October 2018 called the tender “fundamentally
flawed” in a letter sent July 12 to Credit Suisse Group AG, the
offer’s manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
