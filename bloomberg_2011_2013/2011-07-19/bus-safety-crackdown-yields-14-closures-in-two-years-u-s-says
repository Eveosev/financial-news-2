The U.S. Transportation Department,
taking a more aggressive enforcement stance after a number of
fatal bus crashes, has shut down 14 motor carriers this year and
in 2010, as many as in the previous decade.  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  has used
“imminent hazard orders” to close the companies, matching the
total for 2000-09, the agency said today in a statement.
Regulators have issued eight out-of-service orders in the past
four months, the agency said.  “We have seen the tragic consequences of unsafe
practices,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in
the statement. The department hopes Congress will “provide us
with the necessary authority to expand our safety oversight.”  Fatal crashes in  New York ,  New Jersey  and  Virginia  this
year have renewed focus on bus companies, especially low-cost
curbside operators popular in cities like New York and
Washington.  Greyhound Lines Inc. , the largest U.S. carrier,
announced July 14 that it would back a Senate measure to require
seat belts and stronger roofs for new buses.  That bill, approved May 5 by the Senate Commerce Committee,
is expected to be incorporated into broader multiyear surface-
transportation legislation. House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica, a Florida
Republican, said in a July 14 interview that bus-safety
provisions would be part of the six-year bill he’s drafting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
