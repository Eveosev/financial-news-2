West Texas Sour crude’s discount to
the U.S. benchmark narrowed to the smallest in more than two
years after  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  said yesterday it would curtail
August oil shipments by 20 percent on its Keystone pipeline,
boosting demand for the grade.  The Calgary-based company also cut spot and makeup
nominations to zero for August deliveries, Terry Cunha, a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday. The 591,000
barrel-a-day pipeline cut July shipments by 19 percent according
to a bulletin sent to shippers June 20.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 27 cents to 45 cents a
barrel below West Texas Intermediate as of 2:08 p.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
smallest discount for the grade since April 21, 2009.  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed $1.90 to
$16.75 a barrel. The premium for Syncrude gained 25 cents to
$9.75 a barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil
derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $19.50
a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained 50 cents to $24.25 a
barrel over the benchmark.  The premium for the heavy Louisiana grade has increased 74
percent since June 29 when  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  began maintenance
on a pipeline segment that transports the oil.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed 40 cents to $17.30 a barrel, while Poseidon’s
premium lost 55 cents to $16.90.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed $1.60 to $15.65 a
barrel over WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium lost $1 to $23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
