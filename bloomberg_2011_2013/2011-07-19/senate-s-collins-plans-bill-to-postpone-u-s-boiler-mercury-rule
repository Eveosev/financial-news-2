Senator  Susan Collins , a Maine
Republican, plans to introduce legislation that would delay a
federal rule cutting toxic mercury emissions from factory
boilers that has drawn complaints from industry.  Collins said the bill would postpone the regulation for at
least 15 months after the measure became law. Some Democrats are
supporting a similar Republican-backed bill in the U.S. House
that would give companies five years to comply with new
standards affecting refineries, chemical-makers and
manufacturing plants.  “I’m confident it’s going to be a bipartisan bill” in the
Senate, Collins said today in an interview. She said she was
still negotiating with potential co-sponsors on details, such as
how long companies would have to comply with new emissions
standards once they take effect.  In June, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it
will propose new regulations for industrial boilers by the end
of October after companies said earlier versions would cost
thousands of jobs.  New final standards aimed at cutting boiler emissions such
as mercury and soot will be issued by the end of April 2012, the
EPA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
