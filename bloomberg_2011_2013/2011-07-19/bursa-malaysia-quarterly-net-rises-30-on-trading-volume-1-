Bursa Malaysia Bhd. (BURSA) , the country’s
stock exchange operator, said second-quarter profit increased 30
percent as government efforts to spur economic growth bolstered
trading volumes.  Net income in the three months ended June 30 climbed to
35.7 million ringgit ($12 million), or 6.7 sen a share, from
27.5 million ringgit, or 5.2 sen a share, a year ago, the Kuala
Lumpur-based company said in a statement today. Sales advanced
20 percent to 101.1 million ringgit, it said.  “The acceleration in the implementation of various
government transformation programs and prospects for greater
merger and acquisition activities remain immediate key domestic
market drivers,” Bursa said. “Malaysia’s strong economic and
corporate fundamentals will provide support to the  securities
market  amidst the external uncertainties.”  The average daily trading volume on the Southeast Asian
nation’s stock exchange rose 26 percent to 993.7 million shares
in the second quarter, compared with 787.6 million shares in the
same period a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The benchmark  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBMKLCI)  Index climbed
2.2 percent in the second quarter, a fourth straight increase.  Malaysia’s Transformation  Malaysia aims to double the size of its capital markets by

billion of private-sector led projects this decade, ranging from
mass rail to energy and pledged to transform the country into a
developed economy by 2020.  Revenue from trading in equities climbed 25 percent in the
period to 46.1 million ringgit, Bursa said today. Derivatives

share, compared with 9.5 sen a year earlier, it said.  The bourse’s shares dropped 1.2 percent to 7.54 ringgit at

results. The stock has fallen 3.3 percent this year, compared
with a 2.4 percent gain in the benchmark  stock index .  Bursa is targeting profit to grow at least 20 percent per
annum on average over the next three years, the company said in
a separate e-mailed statement today.  The bourse plans to engage with foreign and local
investors, it said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
