Ezz Steel,  Egypt ’s biggest publicly
traded producer of the metal, fell to the lowest level in a week
after 2010 standalone profit declined more than half.  The shares of the country’s biggest publicly traded steel
manufacturer lost 1.8 percent to 9.79 Egyptian pounds at the
2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the lowest level since July 12. That
gave Ezz a market value of 5.32 billion pounds ($893 million).
The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  retreated 0.6 percent.  Annual standalone net income dropped to 116.1 million
pounds from 249.6 million pounds in 2009. Egypt’s bourse said
July 6 it gave the Cairo-based company 15 days to report 2010
and first-quarter results, or face a trading suspension.  Ezz
Steel (ESRS)  hasn’t released 2010 consolidated results or first quarter
figures.  Separately, the price of steel rebar sold in Egypt rose
11.8 percent in June to 5,257 pounds per ton, Al Masry Al Youm
reported, citing a report by the state-run Central Agency for
Public Mobilization and Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
