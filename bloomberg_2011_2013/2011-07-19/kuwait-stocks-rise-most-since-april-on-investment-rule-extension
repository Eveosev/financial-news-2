Kuwaiti stocks advanced the most in
three months, bucking the declines in Persian Gulf markets,
after the country’s regulator extended a deadline for investment
companies to comply with a capital markets law.  National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) , the country’s largest lender,
gained 1.9 percent.  Ithmaar Bank BSC (ITHMR) , an Islamic investment
bank, headed for its biggest advance in more than two months.
The benchmark SE Price Index climbed 0.6 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since April 20, to 6,006.40 at 10:43 a.m. in
Kuwait City. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200) , which tracks the
biggest 200 companies in the Gulf, fell less than 0.1 percent.  Kuwait’s Capital Market Authority extended the period
for investment companies to comply with guidelines for
investment ratios in a single stock by six months to March 12,
state-run KUNA news agency reported today, citing a statement by
the authority. The delay is attributed to economic concerns and
the “state” of the local stock exchange, the regulator said.  “They have postponed, so it’s more like a breather so
local funds can comply with the rules,” Faisal Hasan, head of
research at Global Investment House, said in a telephone
interview in  Kuwait City . “We will have to see what happens
next. We need more clarity on the issue.”  The capital markets law, which places restrictions on
investment funds, helped bring Kuwait’s benchmark index down 1.6
percent yesterday to the lowest level since September 2004. The
regulation stipulates that investment funds may not own more
than 10 percent of a publicly traded company, or invest more
than 10 percent of the fund in one company.  National Bank of Kuwait rose the most since May 31 to 1,100
fils. Ithmaar Bank jumped 5.4 percent, poised for the biggest
jump since May 10, to 19.50 fils.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  fell 0.9 percent. Qatar’s gauge
lost 0.1 percent, while  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  retreated
0.3 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  dropped 0.2 percent and
Bahrain’s measure was little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
