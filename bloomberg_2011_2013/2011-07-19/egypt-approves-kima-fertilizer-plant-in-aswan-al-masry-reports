Egypt ’s Industrial Development
Agency has approved the establishment of a fertilizer plant for
Egyptian Chemical Industries, also known as Kima, in Aswan,
Egypt,  Al Masry Al Youm  reported.  The company’s request to build the factory had been denied
since 2009 because it wasn’t deemed economically viable by the
previous government, the newspaper said, citing unidentified
officials at the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
