Bats Global Markets, the exchange
operator planning to go public, withdrew a proposal that would
have let market makers on its options venue give certain
brokers better prices than those publicly available.  “The rule has many elements that are broadly seen as
positive, but when taken as a whole, there may be a few concerns
that could be better addressed,” Joe Ratterman, the chief
executive officer of Lenexa, Kansas-based Bats, wrote in a
newsletter distributed today. “We will retract the currently
approved rule until we are confident that the final result will,
in fact, make markets better.”  The so-called directed-order program was approved by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission three weeks ago over the
objections of  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) ,  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) ,  NYSE
Euronext (NYX) ,  International Securities Exchange  and BOX Options
Exchange.  The Bats program would have let market makers send the
exchange two prices on options contracts. One would be displayed
publicly while the other, assuming the first is quoting at the
national best bid or offer, would improve that price and be
hidden. The second, better price would be available only to
brokers directing orders to that market maker who are on a list
of approved firms. Others couldn’t access it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
