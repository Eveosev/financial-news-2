Angolan lawmakers approved a new law
that will cut taxes on mining to help boost exploration for
minerals and reduce the country’s dependence on oil, said
Joaquim David, the mines minister.  The tax will decline to 25 percent from 30 percent, David
said today in parliament, in the capital, Luanda.  “The law offers better guarantees, better protection for
investors,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
