Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
is considering asking Luiza Helena Trajano, president of
furniture and electronics retailer Magazine Luiza SA, to take up
a newly created Cabinet post overseeing small companies, a
government official familiar with the discussions said.  Rousseff will only make a final decision after Congress
approves the creation of the new post, said the official, who
wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the issue. Newspaper
Folha de S.Paulo reported earlier today that Rousseff may ask
Trajano to join the Cabinet, without saying where it obtained
the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
