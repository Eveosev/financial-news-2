Minnesota’s Democratic Governor  Mark Dayton  called a special legislative session to vote on budget
bills to end the nation’s longest state shutdown since 2002.  The legislature is scheduled to meet at 3 p.m. local time
today, after the administration and Republican legislative
leaders settled the details of the measures, Dayton said in a
statement issued by his office.  “This is an agreement that will get Minnesota back to
work,” House Speaker Kurt Zellers said in a news conference at
the Capitol in  St. Paul .  Dayton, 64, and Republican legislative leaders reached the
framework of an agreement last week to close a $5 billion state
budget deficit and have been negotiating the details since then.
The sides agreed to bridge a $1.4 billion budget gap by raising
$700 million through bonds tied to the 1998 tobacco settlement
and shifting $700 million in education spending into the next
budget, according to a proposal Dayton made last week.  Most government functions stopped at 12:01 a.m. July 1
after Dayton and lawmakers failed to resolve the budget dispute
in the Midwestern state of 5.3 million. The closure idled 23,000
workers, closed parks and agencies, and halted construction
projects.  The shutdown is the longest of six in U.S. states since
2002 by 10 days, according to the  National Conference of State
Legislatures .  To contact the reporter on this story:
