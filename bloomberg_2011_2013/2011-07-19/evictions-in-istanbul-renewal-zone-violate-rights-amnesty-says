Forced evictions from the Tarlabasi
district of central Istanbul as part of an urban renewal project
violate international law and residents’ rights,  Amnesty
International  said.  Public officials have forced residents in the low-income
area from their homes and in some cases made them sign documents
they weren’t allowed to read, the London-based human rights
advocacy group said in a statement issued yesterday.  Residents who are being evicted said they were offered
alternative housing only on the outskirts of Istanbul, more than
two hours away from the center by public transport, it said.  The group called for an investigation into allegations of
harassment by public officials and for the immediate suspension
of “imminent forced evictions,” according to the statement.  Huri Yazici, press relations director at the Beyoglu
municipality, said officials have seen the Amnesty statement and
have no immediate comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
