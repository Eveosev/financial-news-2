Ghana will probably increase cocoa
production to 1 million metric tons by the end of August because
of good weather and improved farming techniques,  Reuters 
reported, citing Yaw Adu-Ampomah, deputy chief executive officer
of the Ghana Cocoa Board.  The country has produced more than 980,000 tons, the  news
agency  cited Adu-Ampomah as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
