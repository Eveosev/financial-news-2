The United Arab Emirates phone
operators, Emirates Telecommunications Corp. and Emirates
Integrated Telecommunications Co., will compete for fixed-line
subscribers in broadband and voice services by year-end, the
country’s regulator said in a statement on its  website  today.  The move aims to “introduce nationwide competition in
fixed-line telecommunications services,” the Telecommunications
Regulatory Authority said. The two operators have been working
on a network sharing scheme using “bitstream access”
technology, it added.  Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Co., known as Du,
broke the monopoly of Emirates Telecommunications Corp., known
as Etisalat, in the U.A.E. in 2007. Etislat, has lost domestic
market share to Du as a result. The operators compete for mobile
customers in the Gulf Arab state while offering fixed-line
services in separate locations.  “We will soon enter a phase of strong competition in fixed
services,” said Mohamed Al Ghanim, the regulator’s director
general. “We hope that this final stage of testing and
implementation is successful so that we can see a commercial
launch before the end of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
