Kuwait’s Capital Market Authority
granted investment companies six months extra to March 12 next
year to comply with guidelines for investment ratios in a single
stock,  KUNA  said, citing a statement by the authority.  The delay is attributed to economic concerns and “the
state of Kuwait’s Stock Exchange,” according to the statement,
the state-run news agency reported.  Kuwait’s benchmark KSE Price Index plummeted 1.6 percent to
5,973.1, the lowest since September 2004, at the 12:30 p.m.
close in  Kuwait City  yesterday. The measure has lost 14 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
