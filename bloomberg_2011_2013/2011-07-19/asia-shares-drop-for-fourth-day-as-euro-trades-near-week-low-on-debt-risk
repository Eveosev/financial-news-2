Stocks surged, sending the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index to its biggest gain in four months, and
Treasuries rallied amid optimism lawmakers were moving closer to
a deal that would cut the  U.S. budget deficit  and avoid default.
Oil helped lead gains in commodities and the dollar fell.  The  S&P 500  jumped 1.6 percent to 1,326.73 at 4 p.m. in New
York, its biggest gain since March 3. The S&P GSCI Index of 24
commodities advanced 1 percent as oil surged 1.6 percent to
$97.50 a barrel. Ten-year Treasury note yields lost five basis
points to 2.88 percent and the Dollar Index, a gauge of the
currency against six major peers, slipped 0.5 percent.
Nasdaq-100 Index futures climbed 0.7 percent at 5:12 p.m. after
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  beat earnings estimates.  Stocks added to an early advance and Treasuries climbed
after President  Barack Obama  endorsed a deficit-cutting proposal
by a bipartisan group of senators known as the “Gang of Six.”
Earlier gains in global equities were triggered by higher-than-
estimated results at companies from  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)  to Coca-Cola Co. and  Novartis AG. (NOVN)   “We’re getting positive news flow on two fronts today: the
political front related to the national debt ceiling and we have
the reports coming out of the earnings season,”  Keith Wirtz ,
who helps oversee $18 billion as chief investment officer for
Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati, said in a telephone
interview. “A good earnings season might put a floor in this
stock market.”  Apple Gains  Apple rose 5.1 percent to $395.89, and exceeded $400 for
the first time, following the regular trading session. Apple
beat the average estimate for per-share earnings by 33 percent,
lifted by sales of iPhones and iPads.  The S&P 500 erased yesterday’s 0.8 percent slide and
rebounded from a three-week low. S&P 500 technology shares
climbed 2.7 percent as a group, the most in a year, to lead
gains among all 10 of the index’s main industries.  IBM jumped 5.7 percent to an all-time high of $185.21 to
lead gains in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , which surged
202.26 points, or 1.6 percent, to 12,587.42 in its first gain of
more than 200 points this year. Coca-Cola Co. climbed 3.3
percent, Wells Fargo & Co. added 5.7 percent and Harley-Davidson
Inc. rallied 8.9 percent after each reported higher-than-
estimated results.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  lost 0.7 percent after the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets reported second-quarter profit that
trailed analysts’ estimates. Goldman Sachs was one of only five
S&P 500 companies to post quarterly results that trailed
estimates since the reporting season started. Per-share earnings
have topped analysts’ estimates at 31 of the 36 companies in the
S&P 500 that released earnings since July 11, according to
Bloomberg data.  ‘Finally Shining’  “Profits are finally shining through some of the daunting
headlines and investors are taking notice,” Jack Ablin , chief
investment officer for Chicago-based Harris Private Bank, which
oversees $55 billion, said in a telephone interview. “IBM was a
big one,” he said. It sent “a strong signal that companies can
still thrive in an uncertain economic environment.”  All 12 stocks in an S&P gauge of homebuilders advanced
after U.S. housing starts increased more than forecast in June
to the fastest pace in five months. Work began on 629,000 houses
at an annual pace, up 14.6 percent from the prior month, figures
from the Commerce Department showed. Housing starts were
projected to rise to a 575,000 annual rate  Murdoch Speaks  News Corp. (NWS)  shares rallied 5.5 percent. Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch  told U.K. lawmakers that he
wasn’t responsible for the phone-hacking scandal at the
company’s News of the World newspaper, saying that the blame
lies with the “people that I trusted to run it.”  Thirty-year U.S. bonds rallied, sending their yield down
13 basis points to 4.18 percent, after Obama endorsed a
bipartisan deficit-cutting proposal as “broadly consistent”
with his administration’s approach. The plan to shave about $3.7
trillion from the debt over 10 years put forward by the senators
is “a very significant step,” Obama said. While the
administration hasn’t yet had a chance to review the Senate
proposal in depth, “we’re in the same playing field,” he said.  “We don’t have any more time to posture,” Obama said in
remarks at the White House. Time is running out to raise the
debt limit before Aug. 2, when the Treasury Department has said
the U.S. risks going into default, a step that would roil
financial markets, he said.  Cotton, Corn  Cotton and corn rose at least 1.5 percent to help lead
gains in 18 of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI Index amid
concern that hot, dry weather will hurt crop output. Gold
futures fell $1.30 to $1,601.10 an ounce after reaching an
intraday record of $1,610.70 an ounce yesterday following a 10-
day streak of gains, the longest rally since 1980.  Almost five stocks gained for each that fell in the Stoxx
 Europe  600 Index, which rebounded from the lowest level since
November. Novartis jumped 3.2 percent. SAP AG, the world’s
biggest maker of  business software , and Cap Gemini SA, Europe’s
largest computer-services company, rose more than 1.7 percent
after IBM’s earnings. Electrolux AB, the world’s second-biggest
appliance maker, sank 15 percent as profit missed estimates.  The Stoxx 600 has tumbled 9.2 percent from this year’s high
on Feb. 17 amid concern the region’s debt crisis is spreading
and U.S. lawmakers will fail to reach a deal to raise the
country’s debt limit. The retreat left the gauge trading at
about 12.5 times the reported profits of its companies, near the
cheapest since 2008. The S&P 500 has declined 2.7 percent from a
three-year high in April and started today’s session trading at
14.8 times reported earnings, the cheapest this month.  European Swaps  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell 9.6 basis points to 296.85 basis points,
retreating from an all-time high. The yield on Spanish 10-year
bonds declined 22 basis points to 6.09 percent, driving the
difference in yield with benchmark bunds 25 basis points lower
to 342 basis points. Spain sold 4.45 billion euros ($6.3
billion) of 12- and 18-month bills, compared with a maximum
target of 4.5 billion euros, according to the Bank of Spain.  The yield on  Greece ’s two-year notes surged 304 basis
points to 39.02 percent after the government auctioned 1.625
billion euros of 13-week Treasury bills with a uniform yield of
4.58 percent. Italy’s 10-year yield dropped 23 basis points to
5.10 percent, with Portugal’s down four basis points to 12.6
percent.  Second Meeting  European Union leaders plan to meet for the second time in
a month this week, aiming to break a deadlock over a new Greek
rescue. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said Europe’s sovereign
crisis can’t be fixed “in one step,” damping expectations that
government leaders can resolve the region’s debt  woes at a July
21 summit.  Greece’s sovereign-debt crisis risks infecting the rest of
the euro region even if officials avert a default, threatening
the global economic recovery, the  International Monetary Fund 
said. Both the European Commission and the  European Central Bank 
“considered that a sovereign default or a  credit event  would
likely trigger contagion to the core euro-area economies with
severe economic consequences,” according to an IMF staff report
on the region’s economy.  “Staff however also saw serious risks of contagion, even
under a strategy which tries to avoid default or credit
events,” the report said.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index added 0.6 percent. The
Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index climbed 0.8 percent as
earnings from HDFC Bank Ltd., the nation’s third-biggest lender,
topped analysts’ estimates. South Africa’s FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index advanced 0.6 percent on higher metals prices.  The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.7 percent as China
Merchants Bank Co., the country’s sixth-largest lender, said it
planned to raise as much as 35 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in a
rights offer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
