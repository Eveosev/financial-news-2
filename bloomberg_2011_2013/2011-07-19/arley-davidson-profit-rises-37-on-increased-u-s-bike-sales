Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG) , the biggest
U.S. motorcycle maker, said profit rose after it boosted sales
in its home market for the first time in almost five years. The
company said it will ship more bikes than previously planned.
Shares jumped the most in nine months.  Profit from continuing operations jumped 37 percent to
$190.6 million, or 81 cents a share, from $139.3 million, or 59
cents, a year earlier, Harley said today in a statement. The
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 72 cents.  Retail sales rose 7.5 percent in the U.S. and 5.6 percent
worldwide, the company said. Sales increased 18 percent to $1.34
billion. Harley, the maker of the Fat Boy and V-Rod motorcycles,
has cut expenses by renegotiating labor contracts at factories
in Pennsylvania and  Wisconsin . The Milwaukee-based company also
introduced bikes, such as the $8,000 SuperLow, to appeal to new
riders.  “This was a strong beat and we had an optimistic view on
the quarter,”  Joel Levington , managing director of corporate
credit at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in  New York ,
said in an e-mail. “It underscores that the company has
improved the operating environment and cut costs and it’s
starting to pay off.”  Shares Jump  Harley-Davidson rose $3.70, or 8.9 percent, to $45.11 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
saw their biggest gain since Oct. 5 and closed at the highest
level since January 2008.  Harley said it now expects to ship 228,000 to 235,000
motorcycles, an increase of 8 percent to 12 percent from last
year. It had said in April that it planned to ship 215,000 to
228,000.  The company last reported an increase in U.S. sales in the
fourth quarter of 2006.  “While we are pleased by Harley-Davidson’s second-quarter
results, including the strong jump at retail in the U.S., our
focus remains squarely on sustaining this progress through the
ongoing implementation of our business strategy,” Chief
Executive Officer Keith Wandell said in the statement.  Harley lowered its forecast for restructuring charges to
$490 million to $505 million, including 2011 charges of $80
million to $90 million. The company said in April such charges
would be $510 million to $525 million, including $95 million to
$105 million this year.  In the year-ago period, the company had a $68.1 million
loss from discontinued operations, mostly related to the sale of
its MV Agusta unit. Including that loss, second-quarter profit
more than doubled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
