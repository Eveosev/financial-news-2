The U.K. state-run health system’s
drug budget is expected to grow by about 400 million pounds a
year, reaching about 15 billion pounds ($24 billion) by 2014,
the  Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry  said
today, citing  industry forecasts .  The U.K.’s aging population is driving the growth, with
almost two-thirds of prescriptions written for people over 65,
according to the  ABPI .  The  National Health Service  spends less than 10 percent of
its total budget on medicines, down from 13 percent in 1999, the
association said in an e-mailed statement. New medicines account
for 10 percent of the NHS’s drug budget, the ABPI said. Use of
new cancer medicines in the U.K. is one-third lower than the
European average, the industry body said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
