Nigeria ’s two main labor federations
will go ahead with a planned three-day strike tomorrow that may
threaten oil exports after talks with the government on payment
of the minimum wage broke down, union officials said.  “The federal government has refused to pay the minimum
wage across the board for all levels of workers,” Owei Lakemfa,
secretary-general of the  Nigerian Labour Congress , the country’s
largest union federation, said by phone today from Abuja, the
capital. “So the strike is going on.”  The Trade Union Congress, which represents managerial
workers, is joining the strike in support of demands for the
payment of the monthly 18,000 naira ($118) minimum wage that
President Goodluck Jonathan signed into law in March, its
leader, Peter Esele, said today on state-owned Radio Nigeria.  Oil exports from Africa’s top producer may be disrupted by
the decision of Nigeria’s two oil unions, Nupeng and Pengassan,
affiliates of the federations, to join the strike.  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) , Exxon Mobil Corp.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Eni
SpA (ENI)  run joint ventures with the state-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. that pump most of the country’s crude.  Unions are prepared to call an indefinite strike if the new
wage structure is not implemented after this week’s warning
action, Lakemfa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
