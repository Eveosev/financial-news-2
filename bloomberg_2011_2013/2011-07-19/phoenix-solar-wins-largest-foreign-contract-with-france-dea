Phoenix Solar AG (PS4)  said it won its
largest foreign order to date in France even as the German maker
of photovoltaic modules expects to depend mainly on the U.S. and
 Asia  for future growth.  Phoenix Solar signed a contract with Paris-based Akuo
Energy to build two solar parks in southern France with a peak
capacity of about 12 megawatts each, the Sulzemoos, Germany-
based company said in a statement today. The financial terms
weren’t disclosed.  The deal takes Phoenix Solar’s contract volume in France
this year to “well over” 100 million euros ($142 million),
Chief Executive Officer Andreas Haenel said in the statement.
“So far France is Phoenix Solar’s most important market in
2011,” he said.  Solar companies including Q-Cells SE and  SMA Solar
Technology AG (S92)  are expanding in the U.S. or Asia given slowing
demand in Germany, the world’s largest market for their
products. After governments in France, Italy and Germany cut
subsidies for solar power in the last year, that provided an
added impetus to seek out new markets.  Phoenix Solar expects future growth to come mainly from
Asia and the U.S., company spokesman Christian Strebe said in a
phone interview. It opened a subsidiary in Sant Ramon,
 California  in August 2010. “Things are going well and we expect
to announce a deal there soon,” Strebe said.  Phoenix Solar rose as much as 3.4 percent and traded at
15.07 euros as of 11:30 a.m. in  Frankfurt . The stock has lost 34
percent since the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
