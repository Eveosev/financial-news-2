Mauritius’s rupee weakened for a
third day against the dollar as concern the debt crisis in
 Europe , the Indian Ocean island nation’s biggest trading
partner, may affect the economy.  The currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 28.45 versus the
dollar by 1 p.m. in Port Louis, matching its longest losing
streak since July 7. A close at this level will be the weakest
since July 13.  “The European peripheral economies continue to struggle in
debt capital markets, with namely Spain and Italy finding it
increasingly costly to raise capital,” Mauritius Commercial
Bank, the country’s largest lender by market value, said in an
e-mailed note to clients. Currencies for emerging markets which
have the EU as their major trading partner “have been hit by
the higher level of  risk aversion ,” it said.  Europe is the country’s largest buyer of Mauritian exports,
including sugar and textiles, and is the source of almost two-
thirds of tourists. Mauritius, with a population of 1.3 million
people, has about 67 percent of its import bills and 39 percent
of foreign currency revenue denominated in dollars, according to
Bank of Mauritius.  Consolidated rates from the Bank of Mauritius website today
show a buying price of 27.5774 to 27.7381 for the dollar, with
an average selling price of 29.0386.  The 38-member SEMDEX stocks gauge declined less than 0.1
percent to 2,051.72, led by MCB,  State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) 
and  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the three largest companies by
market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
