State Street Corp. (STT) , the third-
largest custody bank, said it will cut 850 jobs within the next
20 months in addition to the 1,400 job cuts it announced in
November.  About 530 information technology positions will be
eliminated and 320 employees will transfer to jobs at outside IT
vendors, the Boston-based company said today in a statement. All
of the affected positions are located in  North America , the
company said.  State Street earlier today reported net income on an
operating basis climbed 5.2 percent in the second quarter to
$483 million, as rising markets and acquisitions increased the
assets it oversees for clients. Expenses in the three months
ended June 30 increased 20 percent compared with a year earlier,
driven by a 22 percent rise in salaries and employee benefits.  “Expenses were a little higher than our expectations,”
Tom Lewandowski, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in  St. Louis ,
said in a telephone interview.  The company said Nov. 30 it would reduce its workforce by
about 1,400, or 5 percent, by the end of this year as part of an
effort to save as much as $625 million a year by the end of
2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
