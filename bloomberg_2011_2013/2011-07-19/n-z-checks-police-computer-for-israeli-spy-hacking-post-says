New Zealand intelligence officers
are checking the police national computer because of concerns
that Israeli spies may have hacked into it, the Dominion Post
reported, citing a Security Intelligence Service officer it
didn’t name.  An Israeli forensic team in Christchurch to help identify
victims of the Feb. 22 earthquake could have had access to the
computer system, and activities of other groups of Israelis
around that time fueled the hacking concerns, the officer said,
according to the Post.  Those activities included the discovery of five passports
on one man who died in the earthquake and the presence of an
unaccredited Israeli search and rescue team inside the city
cordon, the newspaper reported.  New Zealand Prime Minister John Key declined to comment on
the report because it wasn’t in the national interest, the Post
said, citing his comments to reporters. He was aware of some of
the incidents that occurred but was satisfied there had been no
misuse of the police computer, the newspaper said.  Suggestions of spying were “science fiction,”  Israel ’s
ambassador to New Zealand Shemi Tzur told the Post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
