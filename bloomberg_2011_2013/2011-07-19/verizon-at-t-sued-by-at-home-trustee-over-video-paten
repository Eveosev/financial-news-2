Verizon Communications Inc. and  AT&T
Inc. (T)  were sued by the trustee for the liquidation of Internet
video company At Home Corp. for allegedly infringing patents on
the delivery of video content.  Verizon’s FiOS television service and AT&T’s U-verse
service violate At Home patents, according to a complaint filed
in Manhattan federal court today by Richard Williamson, who
represents the At Home Bondholders Liquidation Trust.  At Home, a joint venture of cable companies including Cox
Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and TCI, ran a high-speed
Internet service from 1996 to 2002. According to the complaint,
it had 4.1 million subscribers in 2001, the year it filed for
Chapter 11 creditor protection, stating that distribution
agreements with cable companies had left it unprofitable.  Marty Richter, a spokesman for Dallas-based AT&T, declined
to comment.  Bob Varettoni , a spokesman for New York-based
Verizon, had no immediate comment.  The case is Williamson v.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , 11-
cv-4948, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
