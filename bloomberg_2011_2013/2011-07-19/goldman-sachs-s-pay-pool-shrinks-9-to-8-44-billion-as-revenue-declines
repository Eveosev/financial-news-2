Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  set aside
$8.44 billion for its compensation pool in the first six months
of 2011, 9 percent less than in the same period a year earlier
as revenue tumbled 11 percent.  The expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and benefits,
was enough to provide each of the firm’s 35,500 employees with
$237,662 for the six-month period, according to figures posted
today on the New York-based company’s website. A year earlier,
the firm set aside $9.3 billion for compensation, excluding a
$600 million one-time U.K. tax on bonuses, or $272,581 for each
of the 34,100 staff at the time.  Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, is among Wall Street firms seeking ways
to curb costs as revenue from trading equities and fixed-income
products drops for the second consecutive year.  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  reported last week that the compensation expense at its
investment bank was unchanged for the first half of the year
even though it employed 5 percent more workers and generated 6
percent more revenue than a year earlier.  “They’ve continued to streamline some of their costs,”
said Douglas G. Ciocca, managing director at Kavar Capital
Partners LLC in Leawood,  Kansas , which manages about $225
million in assets, including Goldman Sachs shares. He spoke
before the earnings were released. Still “you’ve got to make
sure you retain the top people.”  Goldman Sachs’s pay expense represented 44 percent of
revenue in the six-month period compared with 43 percent a year
earlier. The same ratio at JPMorgan’s investment bank was 38
percent in the first six months of 2011, down from 40 percent a
year earlier.  Average compensation figures are derived by dividing the
overall compensation pool by the number of employees and don’t
represent individual workers’ actual pay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
