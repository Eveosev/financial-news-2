Taiwan’s dollar strengthened for the
first time in three days on speculation exporters were taking
advantage of recent declines to convert income at a more-
favorable  exchange rate .  The currency trimmed gains after exchange data showed
overseas investors sold $201 million more Taiwanese shares than
they bought today, bringing net sales for the year to $731
million. Government data tomorrow may show export orders rose
10.05 percent in June from a year earlier, the least in four
months, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of economists.  “The current level is quite weak, so we’ve seen some
exporters selling the  U.S. dollar ,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-
based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial
Bank. “Taiwan’s dollar has been rangebound for over two months
now. This is something the central bank would like to see.”  The  Taiwan dollar  appreciated 0.1 percent to NT$28.920
against its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. local close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.965, the weakest
level since July 13.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 2
percent notes due July 2016, the most-traded government debt,
was 1.184 percent compared with 1.187 percent yesterday, prices
from Gretai Securities Market show.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was unchanged at 0.373 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
