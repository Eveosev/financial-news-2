Syrian security forces killed at
least seven anti-government protesters during a funeral today in
the central city of Homs, human rights activists said.  The killings increased the death toll among anti-government
protesters to more than 1,900 since the uprising against Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad began in March, Mahmoud Merhi, head of
the Arab Organization for Human Rights, and  Ammar Qurabi , head
of the National Organization for Human Rights in  Syria , said in
telephone interviews today.  More than 100 people have been arrested in the town of
Zabadani near the border with Lebanon, and in suburbs of the
capital Damascus, they said. Pro-government gunmen yesterday
attacked Homs after scores of people were killed in the previous
four days amid reports of sectarian fighting, they said.  Syria has been ruled by minority Alawites, a Shiite Muslim
offshoot, since Assad’s father took power in 1970. The majority
of the country’s population is Sunni. Assad has blamed the
rallies, part of a wave of unrest in the  Middle East  this year,
on a foreign conspiracy while saying demonstrators’ demands
“have merit” and that changes are needed.  Merhi said the burning of stores belonging to Sunnis and
Alawites in Homs illustrates rising tensions between the two
communities. Qurabi said pro-Assad gunmen had been sent into the
city to stir up trouble.  “There is no sectarian fighting,” he said. “The
government is trying to promote tension to legitimize the use
and entry of its army into all areas.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
