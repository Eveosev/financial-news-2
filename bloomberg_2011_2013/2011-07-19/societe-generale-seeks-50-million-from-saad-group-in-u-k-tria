Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, France’s
second-biggest bank, told a U.K. trial judge that a unit of
Saudi Arabia’s  Saad Group  failed to repay a $50 million loan
guaranteed by its billionaire founder Maan al-Sanea.  The unit, Saad Trading Contracting & Financial Services
Co., defaulted on the loan arranged in 2009, four months before
Saad Group said it would seek to restructure its debt, lawyers
for Societe Generale said today at the  High Court  in  London . The
lawsuit, filed in August 2009, seeks repayment of the loan plus
a commission and legal costs.  The trial comes as al-Sanea, deemed the world’s 62nd
richest person by Forbes Magazine in 2009, faces separate fraud
claims by another Saudi company, Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi &
Brothers Co., which alleges al-Sanea used fake documents to take
out billions of dollars in loans in Algosaibi’s name.  Units of Saad Group and Algosaibi, both based in the Saudi
oil city of Al-Khobar, defaulted after borrowing about $15.7
billion from more than 80 banks. Al-Sanea married into the
Algosaibi family before founding Saad Group, which has
businesses ranging from construction to health care.  Algosaibi last month admitted liability in a $250 million
lawsuit in London filed by  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and four other
banks that loaned it money before the default.  Tim Robertson, a U.K.-based spokesman for al-Sanea,
declined to comment on the trial when reached today by phone.
The company has consistently denied the allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
