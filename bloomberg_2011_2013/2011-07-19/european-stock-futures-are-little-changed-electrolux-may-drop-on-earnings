European stocks gained, rebounding
from a seven-month low, as companies from  Novartis AG (NOVN)  to
International Business Machines Corp. reported earnings that
beat estimates.  Novartis,  Europe ’s second-biggest drugmaker by sales,
climbed the most in three months.  SAP AG (SAP)  led a rally in
technology companies after IBM boosted its forecasts.  Nordea
Bank AB (NDA)  soared 5.7 percent after profit increased.  Electrolux
AB (ELUXB) , the world’s second-biggest appliance maker, plunged the most
in four years as results trailed projections.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rallied 0.8 percent to 264.28 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has still tumbled 9.2
percent from this year’s high on Feb. 17 amid concern the
region’s debt crisis is spreading and U.S. lawmakers may will
fail to reach a deal to raise the country’s debt limit. The
retreat has left the measure trading at about 12.5 times the
reported profits of its companies, near the cheapest since 2008.  “Earnings are not too bad at all,” said Markus Huber,
head of German sales trading at ETX Capital in  London . “It is
doubtful that even if the earnings season continues to go well
stocks can break out to the upside as long as uncertainties like
the potential default of  Greece  and the U.S. debt ceiling is not
solved. In the short term, however, stocks which beat estimates
and raise forecasts should perform well.”  IBM Earnings  IBM, the world’s biggest computer-services company,
reported revenue that beat analysts’ estimates and boosted its
full-year profit forecast late yesterday as companies bought
more software and equipment. Thirty-one of the 36 companies in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that have reported results since
July 11 topped per-share profit projections, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  President  Barack Obama  and congressional leaders are making
little progress in debt-reduction talks after House Speaker  John
Boehner  said all sides must settle for a smaller plan than the
president seeks. Obama is holding his fifth round of public
remarks on the debt in a week today as he presses lawmakers to
reach an agreement to raise the $14.3 trillion U.S. borrowing
ceiling before an Aug. 2 deadline.  European Union government chiefs plan to meet for the
second time in a month on July 21, aiming to break a deadlock
over a new Greek rescue that has spooked investors. Spanish and
Italian bonds yields surged yesterday, piling pressure on
officials to end the turmoil.  Spain  sold 4.45 billion euros
($6.3 billion) of 12-month and 18-month bills today.  U.S. Economy  A report today showed housing starts in the U.S. rose more
than forecast in June to the fastest pace in five months. Work
began on 629,000 houses at an annual pace, up 14.6 percent from
the prior month, figures from the Commerce Department showed
today. The level of starts exceeded the most optimistic forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  National benchmark indexes gained in all of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.7 percent.  France ’s
CAC 40 and  Germany ’s DAX advanced 1.2 percent.  Novartis, the second-biggest stock in the Stoxx 600 by
weighting, climbed 3.2 percent to 51.05 Swiss francs, the
largest gain in since April, as earnings excluding some costs
climbed to $3.56 billion, or $1.48 a share. Analysts had
forecast profit of $1.44, according to the average of 17
estimates compiled by Bloomberg in the past month.  Technology Shares  Technology stocks were the best-performing group in the
Stoxx 600 after IBM’s better-than-estimated earnings. SAP, the
world’s biggest maker of  business software , gained 1.8 percent
to 41.10 euros while  ASML Holding NV (ASML) , Europe’s biggest
semiconductor-equipment maker, climbed 3.2 percent to 24.92
euros. Software AG, Germany’s second-biggest software maker,
rose the most since January, surging 7.1 percent to 34.13 euros.  Nordea soared 5.7 percent to 66.40 kronor, ending the
longest falling streak in four months. The Nordic region’s
largest lender posted a 30 percent increase in second-quarter
profit as it set aside less money for doubtful loans.  Renewable Energy Corp. ASA climbed 10 percent to 9.14
kroner as the Norwegian maker of solar energy components said
second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose to 871 million kroner ($157 million) from 455
million kroner a year earlier.  Alfa Laval AB (ALFA)  surged 6.5 percent to 139.40 kronor after the
world’s largest maker of heat exchangers said second-quarter
sales increased 23 percent to 7 billion kronor ($1 billion).  Electrolux plunged 15 percent to 123.10 kronor, the biggest
drop since January 2007, after saying second-quarter net income
fell to 561 million kronor from 1.03 billion kronor a year
earlier. Analysts on average expected profit of 677 million
kronor, a survey by Bloomberg showed.  Husqvarna AB (HUSQB)  tumbled 11 percent to 34.96 kronor as the
world’s largest maker of lawnmowers reported second-quarter net
income that missed estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
