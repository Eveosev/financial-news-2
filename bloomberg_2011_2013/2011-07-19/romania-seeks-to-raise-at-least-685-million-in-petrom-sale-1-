Romania is seeking to raise at least
2.07 billion lei ($690 million) from the sale of a 9.8 percent
stake in  OMV Petrom SA (SNP)  this week to fund its  budget deficit  and
meet international pledges.  The government, which is selling 5.57 billion shares in the
country’s dominant oil company through July 22, today set a
minimum price of 0.3708 lei per share, after previously
announcing a maximum price of 0.46 lei per share, Economy
Minister Ion Ariton told reporters in Bucharest.  “I am 100 percent sure this offer will be a success,”
Ariton said. “I’m confident we can sell the stake at a higher
price than the minimum price set today.”  The eastern European country is cutting spending and
bringing in revenue from sales of minority stakes in energy
companies to meet pledges to the  International Monetary Fund  and
the European Union, from which it has secured two loans since
2009. It plans to narrow the budget deficit to less than 3
percent of gross domestic product in 2012 from a targeted 4.4
percent in 2011.  The share sale will be deemed complete if valid
subscription reaches at least 80 percent of the offer, according
to a  prospectus  published on July 7. Institutional investors may
subscribe for as much as 85 percent of the offered shares, with
the remaining 15 percent going to retail investors.  Shares Rise  Petrom shares rose as much as 2.2 percent to a four-day
high of 0.3895 lei in Bucharest today and closed at 0.3821 lei,
posting a loss of 4.2 percent since the start of the offering on
July 11. The stock has risen about 14 percent this year.  The government may repeat the sale next year, should the
subscription fail to reach 80 percent of the offered shares,
Ariton said.  “We have the legal possibility to postpone the share sale
if the subscriptions don’t exceed 80 percent of the package, but
I’m confident that won’t happen,” he said.  Romania will probably sell the stake at 0.37 lei and 0.39
lei per share, analysts at Banca Comerciala Romana SA and KBC
Securities told Bloomberg yesterday.  The final subscription price will be set for two
installments, one for institutions and the other for retail
investors, depending on demand.  Renaissance Capital , EFG
Securities, BT Securities Romania SA and Romcapital SA are
managing the sale.  Petrom is majority owned by  OMV AG (OMV)  of  Austria . The Romanian
government holds 20.6 percent. Fondul Proprietatea SA, Romania’s
4 billion-euro ($5.7 billion) property-restitution fund, holds
20.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
