The ruble appreciated the most
against the dollar in almost a week as speculation European
lawmakers will reach an agreement on the region’s debt crisis
boosted  oil prices .  The currency was 0.8 percent stronger at 28.03 per dollar
at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest jump since July 13.
The ruble was 0.4 percent weaker at 39.765 per euro, leaving it
little changed at 33.3107 versus the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, rose after European
Central Bank council member  Ewald Nowotny  suggested that the
bank may compromise and allow a temporary Greek default. Crude
for August delivery gained as much as $2.52 a barrel and last
traded at $97.92 a barrel.  “There has been a bit of a rebound coming from yesterday,
European, Middle Eastern and African currencies as a whole have
been strengthening against the dollar,” Thu Lan Nguyen, a
currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in
response to e-mailed questions. “This could, however, just be
the calm before the storm. Right now the main concern is the
debt problems in the Eurozone.”  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said an
agreement is “attainable” at a European summit in two days.
The two-year notes of Greece and  Portugal , both of which have
received bailouts, yield 35.3 percent and 17.8 percent
respectively, compared with the 5.3 percent yield on similar-
maturity Russian debt.  Russian  government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the
ruble Eurobond due in 2018 down two basis points to 6.848
percent. Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to
expectations of currency movements and allow companies to hedge
against them, show the ruble at 28.3025 per dollar in three
months, compared with 28.4699 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
