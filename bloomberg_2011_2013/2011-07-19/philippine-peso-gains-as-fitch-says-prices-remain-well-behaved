The  Philippine peso  advanced the
most in four weeks after Fitch Ratings said the nation was
expected to meet its 3 percent to 5 percent inflation target
this year.  Consumer prices remain “well behaved,”  Andrew Colquhoun ,
head of Fitch’s Asia-Pacific Sovereigns team, said in Manila
today. Annual inflation was 4.6 percent in June, the fastest
since April 2009, according to official data. The government
completed a record peso bond exchange last week.  “The successful debt swap and positive comments from Fitch
on inflation are supporting the currency,” said  Prakriti Sofat ,
a regional economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore. “The
fundamental story of the Philippines remains fairly strong.”  The peso strengthened 0.5 percent to 42.840 per dollar at
the 4 p.m. close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency has gained 1.8 percent this year. The central bank may
increase its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point
to 4.75 percent when it meets on July 28, Sofat predicted.  The Philippines must raise revenue, investments and
economic growth to secure a credit-rating upgrade, Colquhoun
said. The nation is rated BB+ by Fitch, one level below
investment grade.  Philippine four-year peso bonds declined. The yield on the
8.375 percent securities due May 2015 increased two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.98 percent, according to
the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  The government sold 9 billion pesos ($210 million) of 4.875
percent bonds due July 2015 today, according to the Bureau of
the Treasury. Bids totaled 22.68 billion pesos, allowing the
Treasury to sell all the debt on offer.  To contact the reporter for this story:
