New Zealand’s dollar rose against
all of its most-traded peers as investors bet the nation’s
central bank may raise  interest rates  as early as next week.  The currency, nicknamed the kiwi, reached a record high
against the dollar as Toronto Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit
said the  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand may raise its key rate a
half-percentage point. Australia’s dollar gained against most
major counterparts as stocks and commodities rose.  “We are warming to the theme” that there may be a 50
basis-point, or 0.50 percentage-point, increase in rates as soon
as next week,  Annette Beacher , head of Asia-Pacific research at
TD Securities in Singapore, wrote in a research note today. “At
the very least, the bank may prepare the market for such a move
at the 15 September Monetary Policy Statement.”  New Zealand ’s dollar climbed as much as 1.5 percent to
touch a record 85.73 U.S. cents before trading at 85.53 cents at
2:32 p.m. in  New York , from 84.50 cents yesterday. The kiwi
strengthened 1.4 percent versus the yen to 67.73, from 66.79.  Australia’s currency appreciated 1 percent to at $1.0714,
from $1.0607. The Aussie advanced 1.2 percent to 84.83 yen, from
83.84 yen yesterday.  New Zealand’s central bank lowered the official cash rate
to 2.5 percent in March to revive confidence after an earthquake
devastated the southern city of Christchurch. Policy makers meet
next week.  Investors expect the RBNZ to increase the key rate by 81
basis points in the next 12 months, according to a Credit Suisse
Group AG index based on swaps. That compares with an outlook on
July 11 for a 66 basis-point increase.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index rose 1.2 percent, and the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials gained 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
