The  New Jersey Devils  named Pete DeBoer as their coach, replacing Jacques Lemaire.  DeBoer, 43, was fired by the Florida Panthers after failing
to lead the National Hockey League team to the playoffs during
his three-year tenure. He had a 103-107-36 record with Florida.  The Devils, three-time winners of the  Stanley Cup , missed
the playoffs last season for the first time since 1996. Lemaire
came out of retirement in December as an interim replacement
after rookie coach John MacLean was fired.  It’s the ninth coaching change for the Devils since 2005,
when Pat Burns resigned the post after being diagnosed with
cancer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
