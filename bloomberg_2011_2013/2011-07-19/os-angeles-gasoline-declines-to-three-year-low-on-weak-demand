The discount for spot gasoline in
 Los Angeles  weakened for the second day, reaching a new three-
year low, on “lackluster demand,” said Chris Mennis, president
of broker New Wave Energy LLC.  Prompt-delivery of California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles fell 2.75 cents to a discount of 20.25 cents versus
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange as of 2:23
p.m. New York time. That’s the lowest level since January 2008,
when the fuel reached a discount of 22.5 cents.  Los Angeles Carbob’s spread fell as gasoline futures
advanced and demand waned, Mennis said. “And refineries are
pretty darn healthy,” he said.  Carbob’s discount in Los Angeles widened 1.75 cents
yesterday.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  said it plans to flare gases at the
Wilmington,  California , refinery through July 27. “I can
confirm there is no planned maintenance work under way at this
time,” Rich Johnson, a spokesman for the Houston-based company,
said in an e-mail yesterday.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , based in San Ramon, California, is said to
be planning maintenance on a coker and a vacuum gasoil unit at
its El Segundo, California, refinery in August and a 45-day
turnaround at its Richmond, California, refinery in October.  The discount for Carbob in San Francisco widened 2.75 cents
to 22.25 cents versus futures. The fuel, which strengthened 0.75
cent yesterday, traded 2 cents below Los Angeles Carbob.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon,
weakened 1 cent to a discount of 9.5 cents.  The premium for low-sulfur California diesel in Los Angeles
strengthened 0.25 cent to 3.75 cents a gallon versus Nymex
heating oil futures. The premium for the same fuel in  San
Francisco  fell 0.75 cent to 3.25 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
