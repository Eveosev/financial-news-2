Futures traders increased bullish
bets on  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB)  after  India ’s second-largest non-state
lender’s quarterly earnings were in line with analyst estimates.  Combined open interest, or the number of futures contracts
held by traders, was 32,451, about 8 percent above the 20-day
average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Net income in the three months ended June rose 33 percent
to 10.8 billion rupees ($243 million). A Bloomberg News survey
of 24 analysts expected profit of 10.7 billion rupees. HDFC
shares fell 0.9 percent to 510 rupees as of 2:56 p.m. in Mumbai.  “Investors are building long positions in HDFC Bank
futures,” Savio Shetty, derivatives analyst at Prabhudas
Lilladher Pvt., said in a phone interview today. “Bank stocks
are seeing renewed buying interest as the interest-rate
tightening cycle is nearing an end.”  Traders are writing  call options  at a strike of 520 rupees
suggesting that they are expecting shares to rise, Shetty said.
“The strategy will be beneficial as implied volatility is
declining.”  A call option gives investors the right to buy a security
at a set price by a specific date. A  put option  gives the right
to sell. Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in
the prices of securities they own, speculate on share-price
moves or bet that volatility will rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
