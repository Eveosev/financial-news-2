VMware Inc. (VMW) , the biggest maker of
programs that let computers run multiple operating systems,
forecast sales that topped analysts’ estimates as customers
spent more on products that help data centers run more cheaply.  Revenue in the current period will be $915 million to $940
million,  Palo Alto , California-based VMware said today in a
statement. That topped $898.2 million, the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit and sales for the second
quarter also exceeded projections, while the company increased
its full-year revenue forecast. Shares jumped in late trading.  VMware is benefitting as companies upgrade data centers,
the warehouses that help them deliver computing over the
Internet, via the so-called cloud. VMware started offering
multiyear deals to large companies a little more than three
years ago and many of those are now up for renewal, said  Rajesh Ghai , an analyst at ThinkEquity LLC in  San Francisco .  “These guys are renewing a lot of enterprise license
agreements that they had signed in 2008,” said Ghai, who
recommends buying VMware shares. “But this isn’t just that, this
is clearly a lot of new customers coming on board and buying
their software.”  VMware, majority-owned by EMC Corp., leaped to as high as
$113.50 in late trading after earlier rising $5.24 to $106.02 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock
has risen 19 percent this year.  Higher Full-Year Forecast  Full-year revenue will be $3.65 billion to $3.75 billion
above a previous forecast for sales of as much as $3.65 billion.
Analysts had expected sales of $3.62 billion.  Profit excluding certain costs was 55 cents a share last
quarter, exceeding the 47-cent average of projections compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales rose 37 percent to $921.2 million. Analysts
on average estimated $873 million.  License revenue, a predictor of sales, was $465 million.
Analysts on average had expected about $440 million, Ghai said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
