Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) , the
burrito chain whose share price has more than doubled in the
past year, reported second-quarter profit that trailed analysts’
estimates as food costs gained.  Net income rose 9 percent to $50.7 million, or $1.59 a
share, from $46.5 million, or $1.46, a year earlier, the Denver-
based company said in a statement today. The average of 21
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of
$1.67.  Co-Chief Executive Officers Steve Ells and Montgomery Moran
have raised menu prices to help offset higher ingredient costs.
The Agriculture Department  expects  U.S. meat prices to climb as
much as 7 percent in 2011. Chipotle said its restaurants’
operating margin narrowed to 25.8 percent in the quarter from
26.9 percent a year earlier.  “We expect food-cost inflation for the year of around 5
percent,” Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said during a
conference call today. The restaurant is seeing higher prices
for avocados, dairy and meat, he said.  Chipotle fell $13.71, or 4.1 percent, to $320 at 5:08 p.m.
in trading after the close of the New York Stock Exchange. The
shares had risen 57 percent this year through the close of
regular trading today.  Chipotle, which has about 1,100 locations in the U.S.,
plans to open its first Asian restaurant, ShopHouse, in
 Washington  this year. ShopHouse customers will be able to
customize their food when ordering, similar to Chipotle stores,
the company said in April.  Revenue rose 22 percent to $571.6 million in the three
months ended June 30.  Sales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months
increased 10 percent, the company said. Same-store sales are a
key indicator of a retailer’s growth because new and closed
locations are excluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
