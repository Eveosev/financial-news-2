Siemens AG (SIE)  will write down more than
300 million euros ($422 million) at its health-care division,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said, citing unidentified people close to
the company.  The company’s solar business is sluggish and, while the
wind-energy business has received new orders, profit is coming
under pressure, the German newspaper said.  Profit in the third quarter, to be announced on July 28,
will be above the 1.4 billion euros that Siemens reported a year
earlier and doesn’t include a 650 million-euro payment to Areva
SA. Sales will be similar to last quarter’s 17.7 billion euros
while orders will rise from 20.7 billion euros in the second
quarter, Sueddeutsche said.  Spokespeople for Siemens, based in Munich, didn’t
immediately return a call from Bloomberg News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
