Arsenal has “a substantial amount
of money” to spend on new players during the current trade
period, said Ivan Gazidis, the Premier League soccer club’s
chief executive officer.  The Gunners yesterday signed Ivory Coast striker Gervinho
to a long-term contract for an undisclosed sum as manager  Arsene Wenger  tries to bolster his squad after the club finished its
sixth straight season without a trophy.  “We still will be active in this window,” Gazidis said in
comments on Arsenal’s website. “We haven’t finished our
business at all. We’re just not conducting it publicly; we’re
working hard privately.”  Wenger is said to have about 35 million pounds ($56.2
million) available to him for fees and salaries, the  Daily
Telegraph  reported. Gazidis said he and Wenger spent “an
extended period of time” during the club’s weeklong tour to
 Asia  discussing their transfer strategies and targets.  “The resources are there,” Gazidis added. “We’ve got a
substantial amount of money that we can invest. The important
thing for us, which can be frustrating, is not doing it only in
response to a public clamour but in a way that can positively
impact our performance next year. That’s the focus now.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
