Equatorial Guinea  will increase
exports of its Zafiro crude to five cargoes in September from
four next month, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The country will also export three cargoes of Ceiba blend,
unchanged from August, a separate shipping plan showed. Zafiro
and Ceiba shipments are of 1 million barrels each.  Chad will export four 950,000-barrel lots of Doba grade in
September, unchanged from August, according to a loading plan.  All three crudes are low-sulfur, or sweet.  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  operates the Zafiro and Doba oil fields and  Hess Corp. (HES) 
runs Ceiba.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
