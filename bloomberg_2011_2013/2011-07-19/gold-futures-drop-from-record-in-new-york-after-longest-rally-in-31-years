Gold futures fell from a record
$1,610.70 an ounce on investor sales after the metal’s longest
rally in 31 years.  Before today, the price rose 6.6 percent this month as
European and U.S. debt concerns boosted the appeal of the
precious metal as a haven. The 14-day relative strength index
for gold topped 70 yesterday, a signal that prices may fall.  “This is a market that, on a short-term basis, is
extremely overbought,”  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “There are
a lot of people chasing gold, but I’d be a bit leery buying at
this level just because of the amount of ground it’s covered in
such a short time.”  Gold futures for August delivery fell $1.30 to settle at
$1,601.10 at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The metal
gained in the previous 10 sessions, the longest rally since
January 1980.  The price slumped as much as 1.1 percent to $1,585.20 after
the settlement.  Gold has climbed 13 percent in 2011 amid escalating debt
woes in the U.S. and  Europe . Futures posted gains in the past 10
years.  European leaders are meeting July 21 to discuss a second
bailout for  Greece . The Treasury Department has warned the U.S.
debt ceiling must be lifted by Aug. 2 to avoid default.  Standard
& Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service may downgrade the
government’s credit rating if Congress doesn’t act.  The dollar has dropped almost 5 percent this year against a
basket of major currencies.  ‘Meltdown’  “The uncertainty looming over the markets is on such a
large scale,” Zeman said. “We’re talking about a meltdown if
the U.S. defaults, so the dollar will continue to weaken and
boost gold.”  Silver futures for September delivery fell 12.1 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $40.221 an ounce. On April 25, the price reached
$49.845, a 31-year high.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose $3.70, or 0.5
percent, to $798.30 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Platinum futures for October delivery increased 90
cents to $1,776.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
