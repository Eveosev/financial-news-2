Turkey ’s current-account deficit may
widen to 10.5 percent of gross domestic product this year, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  The deficit will expand from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2010,
according to revised  forecasts published  on the Washington-based
lender’s website that raised the prediction from the 8 percent
made in April. The gap will be 9.8 percent of GDP in 2012, it
said. GDP expand 8.7 percent this year and slow to 2.5 percent
in 2012 because of a “sharp domestic demand cycle,” it said.  Turkish authorities are battling a current-account deficit
that has widened to the biggest since records began in 1984 as
an expanding economy draws in oil, raw materials and  consumer
goods . The country, which imports almost all its oil and gas,
grew an annual 11 percent in the first quarter of the year.  Inflation will average 5.5 percent this year and accelerate
to 6.4 percent next year, the IMF said.  The budget will produce a deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP
this year and 1.6 percent of GDP in 2012, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
