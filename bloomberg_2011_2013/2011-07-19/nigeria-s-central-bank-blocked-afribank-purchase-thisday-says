The  Central Bank of Nigeria  blocked
Vine Capital Partners’ purchase of Afribank Plc because the
private equity company had no track record of managing a
commercial bank,  ThisDay  said, citing Kingsley Moghalu, the
central bank’s deputy governor.  The Committee of Governors at the central bank have to
review what a new company will bring in terms of corporate
governance and risk management, Moghalu said, according to the
Lagos-based newspaper. It is not just a question of proving they
have the money, he said, without giving further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
