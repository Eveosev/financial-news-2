South Africa ’s ruling  African
National Congress  said it is considering the creation of a
state-owned pharmaceutical company to provide drugs for AIDS
patients.  There is “a compelling case for us establishing a state
pharmaceutical company,” ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe
told reporters in Johannesburg, today. Details of the plan are
yet to be established, he said.  About 5.7 million South Africans are infected with the HIV
virus that causes AIDS and a further five million infections are
likely over the next two decades, according to a November report
commissioned by the government. No other country has more
citizens living with the virus, the report said.  Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN) , the largest maker of
generic medicines in the southern hemisphere, in December said
it won about 40 percent of a 4.16 billion-rand ($599 million)
contract to supply South Africa with AIDS treatments. Cipla
Medpor South Africa Ltd. and  Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd. (AIP)  also
won part of the tender.  Creating a state-owned competitor “doesn’t mean the
pharmaceuticals sector will be closed down,” Mantashe said.
“What Aspen will do and any other company will do I don’t think
is an issue now.”  Aspen gained 0.8 percent to 84.20 rand at 1:07 p.m. in
Johannesburg trading, while Adcock advanced 0.6 percent to 61.50
rand. Cipla declined for a third consecutive day, losing 0.4
percent to 6.76 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
