About 1000 Ethiopian peacekeepers
have arrived in Abyei, a region disputed by  Sudan  and newly
independent South Sudan, Sudanese army spokesman Al-Sawarmi
Khaled said.  The Sudanese army will withdraw from the region when the
Ethiopian peacekeepers are fully deployed in Abyei, Khaled said
today by phone from Khartoum, Sudan’s capital.  The  United Nations Security Council  voted on June 27 to
deploy 4,200 Ethiopian soldiers to Abyei, to allow the
withdrawal of forces from Sudan and South Sudan. A week before
the two sides agreed to pull out their forces.   Sudan’s army seized the main town in Abyei on May 21 after
accusing southern security forces of attacking its troops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
