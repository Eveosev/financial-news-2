Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) , the third-
largest independent U.S. custody bank, hired Michael O’Grady
from Bank of America Corp. to become chief financial officer.  O’Grady, a managing director of Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s financial institutions investment banking group, will
join in August and assume his new role on Oct. 1, Northern Trust
said in a statement today. He replaces William Morrison, who
will become the firm’s chief operating officer.  “Mike has advised clients on numerous strategic and
capital markets transactions and is very familiar with Northern
Trust,” Frederick Waddell, Northern Trust’s chief executive
officer, said in the statement. “I am confident that Mike will
strengthen the already outstanding leadership team at Northern
Trust.”  Chicago-based Northern Trust is scheduled to announce
second-quarter earnings tomorrow. Rival custody banks  State
Street Corp. (STT) , based in Boston, and New York-based  Bank of New
York Mellon Corp. (BK)  reported their earnings today, with BNY Mellon
posting a 12 percent increase in profit. State Street missed
analyst’s estimates because of rising expenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
