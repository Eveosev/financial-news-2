U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
met with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan today in Lagos,
where both countries signed agreements to cooperate in trade,
energy and immigration.  “We’ve agreed to double trade between the two countries to
8 billion pounds” within a few years, Cameron said at a press
conference shown live on state-owed television. The U.K. also
plans to help its former colony to increase power generation and
end current shortages.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
