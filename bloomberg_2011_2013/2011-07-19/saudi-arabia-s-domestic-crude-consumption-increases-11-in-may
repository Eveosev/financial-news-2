Saudi Arabia ’s domestic crude oil
consumption increased 11 percent in May from a year earlier,
according to government data.  The world’s largest crude exporter consumed an average 1.98
million barrels a day of oil this year, compared with 1.78
million barrels, Saudi figures posted on the Joint Organization
Data Initiative website yesterday showed.  Domestic use fell by less than 1 percent in May from 1.99
million barrels in April as the PetroRabigh refinery was shut
for maintenance, according to the website.  Saudi Arabia, which aims to fulfill Oil Minister Ali al- Naimi’s recent pledge to increase production to make up for lost
Libyan output after an armed rebellion, is facing rising
domestic demand as the nation’s population grew 3.2 percent
annually from 2004 to 2010.  Consumption reached a record in February when the country
used 2 million barrels a day before two of its refineries, the
PetroRabigh and Yanbu plants, were shut for maintenance. This is
the highest level since at least January 2002, the year when
Saudi Arabia started submitting oil data to JODI.  Saudi Arabia has a capacity to refine 2.12 million barrels
a day of crude, according to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.  The initiative is supervised by the Riyadh-based
 International Energy Forum  and shows data supplied directly by
governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
