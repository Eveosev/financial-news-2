The U.S. Treasury Department elected
directors to two banks that participated in the government’s
capital purchase program.  The Treasury elected John S. Poelker and Guy Rounsaville Jr. to the board of Clayton, Missouri-based First Banks Inc.;
and Gerard M. Thomchick to the board of Narberth, Pennsylvania-
based  Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania Inc. (RBPAA) , the department said
in a statement today.  Board members elected by the Treasury have the same
fiduciary duties to shareholders as other board members, the
department said. The new directors can’t be government employees
and don’t represent the U.S. government.  The Treasury used the Troubled Asset Relief Program’s
capital purchase program to inject capital into U.S. banks. The
program gave the Treasury the right to nominate up to two
members to the board of a capital-purchase program bank if the
institution misses a sixth dividend or interest payment on
preferred stock issued to the Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
