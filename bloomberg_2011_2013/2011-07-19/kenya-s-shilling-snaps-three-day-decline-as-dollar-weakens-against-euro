Kenya ’s shilling gained for the
first trading session in four as the euro strengthened against
the dollar after Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said
an agreement on  Europe ’s debt crisis may be “attainable.”  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained 0.3
percent to 90.01 per dollar at 11:47 a.m. in Nairobi, Kenya’s
capital. It closed at 90.25 yesterday.  “The euro and most of the major currencies are
strengthening against the dollar,” Wilson Mutai, a dealer at
Nairobi-based African Banking Corp Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. “The market is also short of shillings so
people are selling dollars to fund the shortage of shillings.”  The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.4194 as of 10:21 a.m. in
 London  after Venizelos said Europe’s debt crisis may be resolved
at a summit of European leader to be held in two days. The
currency also strengthened 0.8 percent to 112.17 yen and gained
1.1 percent to 1.16369 Swiss francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
