Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  will
have two spokesmen, including the chief media officer from the
Central Intelligence Agency.  CIA spokesman George Little, a civilian, began work today
at the Pentagon. Navy Captain John Kirby, long-time media
representative for retiring Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman
Admiral Michael Mullen, will move over to the secretary of
defense’s office starting in August, said Assistant Secretary of
Defense Doug Wilson.  Little and Kirby succeed former ABC television reporter
 Geoff Morrell , who left the position last month after four years
under former Defense Secretary Robert Gates.  The new dual-spokesman arrangement is unusual for the
Pentagon. Recent secretaries have been identified with one
spokesman -- Gates with Morrell,  Donald Rumsfeld  with Larry
DiRita and before him Victoria Clarke, and  William Cohen  and
William Perry with the late Ken Bacon. When  Dick Cheney  was
defense secretary, now-NBC reporter Pete Williams was his
spokesman.  Little, 39, was appointed CIA public affairs director in
October after joining the shop in April 2007. He previously
worked two years in the National Counterterrorism Center’s
Directorate of Strategic Operational Planning.  Little hold a doctorate in international relations from
Georgetown University in Washington.  Kirby, 47, is a Navy public affairs officer who worked for
Mullen for most of the past 11 years, including most of the past
four years during which Mullen has been chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
