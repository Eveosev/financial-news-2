Oil options volatility slipped as
August futures rebounded to the highest level in three days
after the U.S. Commerce Department reported housing starts
surged and better-than-estimated earnings sent equities higher.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.4 percent at 1 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 29.9 percent yesterday. August options expire tomorrow
at the close of New York Mercantile Exchange floor trading.  Crude for August delivery gained $2.43, or 2.5 percent, to
$98.36 a barrel at 1:54 p.m. on the exchange. Prices have risen
28 percent in the past year. September futures rose $2.69, or
2.8 percent, to $98.94 a barrel.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
September $80 puts, with 2,183 lots changing hands. They slipped
9 cents to 14 cents a barrel. September $110 calls, the next-
most active option, rose 14 cents to 36 cents a barrel with
1,465 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  October $80 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 4,368 lots changing hands. They gained 9 cents
to 72 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, September
$115 calls, slipped 1 cent to 11 cents a barrel on volume of
3,907.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
44,762 contracts. Next were December $125 calls with 41,812 and
December $80 puts with 41,082.  To contact the reporter on this story:
