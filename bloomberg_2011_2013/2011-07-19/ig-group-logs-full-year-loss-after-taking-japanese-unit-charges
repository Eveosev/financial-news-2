IG Group Holdings Ltd., owner of the
IG Index financial spread-betting brand, posted a full-year loss
after taking impairment charges against its Japanese unit.  The net loss was 25.5 million pounds ($41 million), or 7.05
pence per share, in the year ended May 31, compared with a
profit of 101.3 million pounds, or 28 pence per share, a year
earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement. The
company took 143.1 million pounds in charges for its Japanese
operations.  Japan  imposed limits on leverage in trading on foreign
exchange on Aug. 1 and on stock indexes on Jan. 1 which hurt the
company’s business there. The January restrictions curbed bets
to 10 times leverage, where IG Group had been offering up to 100
times or more. IG Group also took charges for shutting its
sports-betting unit, extrabet, to focus on financial wagers,
after failing to find a buyer for the whole unit.  “You’ve got a regulator that doesn’t really engage in
consultation,” Chief Executive Tim Howkins said in a telephone
interview about Japan. IG cut the number of jobs in Japan to 33
from 60, and significantly reduced marketing expenses, which
should restore the unit to profit, he said.  The company also took 5.3 million pounds in charges for the
closure of extrabet. Business dwindled to 2.5 percent of sales,
from half in 1999, and the unit wasn’t likely to make a profit
until the next  World Cup , Howkins said previously.  Active Customers  IG said net trading revenue gained 7.3 percent to 320.4
million pounds, led by a 21 percent rise in continental  Europe .
The number of active financial customers, excluding Japan,
increased 13 percent to 117,252.  IG said its new financial year “started well,” with
higher financial sales in June, even with lower levels of
volatility than a year ago.  Market volatility, which induces customers to trade more,
is down even as the European Union wrestles with how to keep the
Greek debt crisis from spreading, Howkins said.  “As time passes, people become more accustomed to the
sovereign debt crisis,” he said.  IG said it expects to pay a full-year dividend of 20 pence,
up 8.1 percent compared with last year.  IG rose 22.3 pence, or 5.4 percent, to 433.7 pence at the
4:30 p.m. close in  London , the most since February. The shares
have fallen 15 percent so far this year, giving it a market
value of 1.57 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
