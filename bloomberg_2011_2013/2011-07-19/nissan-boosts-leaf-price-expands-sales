Nissan Motor Co., the top-seller of
electric cars in the U.S., is lifting the price of the battery-
powered Leaf as much as 10 percent and expanding sales to nine
more states, mostly in the South.  A 2012 SV grade Leaf will cost $35,200, or 7.4 percent more
than the 2011 SV’s $32,780 price, while the 2012 SL version
rises to $37,250 from $33,720, Nissan said in a statement today.
The increase covers new standard equipment, said Brendan Jones,
Nissan’s U.S. sales manager for Leaf.  “There’s a higher content level on the cars, including a
cold-weather package that’s now standardized for both grades,”
and fast-charge capability for the SL that allows it to be
recharged in as little as 30 minutes from a high-voltage
charger, Jones said in a phone interview. The price increases
aren’t related to sales volume, he said.  Nissan,  Japan ’s second-largest automaker, sold a record
1,708 Leafs to U.S. drivers in June and 3,875 in 2011’s first
half, topping  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s rival plug-in Chevrolet Volt
by more than 1,000 cars. The Yokohama-based company has been
working to accelerate deliveries after initial snags left some
U.S. customers waiting more than a year to get their cars.  Leaf is rated as traveling between about 60 to 100 miles by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency when its lithium-ion
battery packs are fully charged, based on driving conditions.
Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn has set a goal of becoming
the world’s largest electric-car seller, expecting demand for
such vehicles to grow to 10 percent of global sales by 2020.  Nissan expects U.S. Leaf sales of between 10,000 and 12,000
this year and “higher volume” in 2012, Jones said, without
elaborating.  Southern Sales  Starting July 25, consumers in Alabama,  Florida , Georgia,
Illinois, Maryland, Mississippi,  North Carolina ,  South Carolina 
and Virginia as well as  Washington , D.C., who previously
reserved a Leaf online can order a car, Nissan said in its
statement. Initially, only drivers in West Coast states,
Tennessee and other regions have been able to order cars.  All new orders from July 25 will be for 2012 model cars,
affected by the pricing change, said Katherine Zachary, a
company spokeswoman.  Leaf qualifies for a $7,500 federal tax credit, effectively
reducing the model’s price to $27,700 for the SV version and
$29,750 for SL, before taxes and destination and handling
charges. The car can also be leased for as little as $369 a
month, Nissan said.  Nissan’s North American unit is based in Franklin,
 Tennessee , near Nashville.  To contact the reporter on this story:
