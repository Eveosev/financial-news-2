Exports of cocoa from the port of
Abidjan in  Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest producer of the
beans, more than tripled in May, according to data from the
harbor.  Shipments rose to 50,564 metric tons in May from 13,811
tons in the same period a year earlier, according to the data,
which was handed to Bloomberg News at the port yesterday.  Exports of cocoa products declined to 22,272 tons from
22,452 tons a year earlier, according to the harbor’s figures.
 Ivory Coast’s  main harvest runs from October through March,
while a mid-crop is collected from April through September. The
