The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
extend its 28-month rally because more stocks are participating
in the measure’s gain, according to Peter Lee of UBS AG.  The cumulative advance-decline line for  S&P 500  stocks,
which represents the number of daily gains minus the number of
declines, exceeded its May peak this month, reaching the highest
level since Bloomberg started tracking the data in September
2002. That indicator of market breadth suggested the advance
that began in March 2009 could continue even as the S&P 500
failed to surpass its 2011 high this month, Lee said.  “We’re intrigued about the recent technical breakout in
market breadth as it could be signaling another rally,” Lee,
New York-based chief technical analyst for UBS, wrote in a note
yesterday. “Despite concerns of a major top in the marketplace,
we still believe that the overall market breadth remains
supportive as it has yet to indicate any negative divergence.”  The S&P 500 has surged 93 percent from a 12-year low in
March 2009 as the  Federal Reserve  introduced measures to boost
the economy and corporate profit beat analyst estimates. The
rally stalled amid concern the European sovereign-debt crisis
would spread, and U.S. economic data that trailed forecasts. The
Citigroup Economic Surprise Index fell to negative 117.20 on
June 3, meaning reports were missing the median estimate in
Bloomberg surveys by the most since January 2009.  The benchmark gauge dropped as much as 7.2 percent from
this year’s high reached on April 29 as concerns grew that
 Europe ’s debt crisis will spread and American lawmakers will
fail to reach a deal on the nation’s debt limit.  An advance by the S&P 500 above this year’s intraday high
of 1,370.58, reached on May 2, would signal the resumption of
the two-year rally and push the index to the “mid-1400s,” Lee
said. On the other hand, a close below its 2011 low of 1,249.05
could drive it to 1,040, should the market come “under severe
selling pressure,” he said.  The market “is likely headed toward a large, choppy
trading range scenario entering into the second half of this
year and possibly into early 2012,” Lee wrote in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
