Indonesian lawmakers and the  finance
ministry  are struggling to reach an agreement on the composition
of a planned financial regulator before a July 23 deadline, the
head of a parliamentary committee said.  The Financial Services Authority parliamentary working
committee met with Finance Minister Agus Martowardojo today and
tomorrow to try to reach a compromise, and a plenary session
will be held July 21, committee chairman Nusron Wahid said today
in Jakarta. The working group is scheduled to disband July 23.  “Today and tomorrow, we’ll meet with the government to
decide about the board of commissioners,” Wahid told reporters
after a session early today. “We want to see if the government
seriously wants to build this agency.”  Indonesia ’s parliament wants two of its members on the
financial supervisory authority’s board, alongside five
government nominees proposed by the president and two former
officials from the finance ministry and the central bank, said
Andi Rachmat, a deputy chairman of the working group, said June
15. The government’s proposal is two former finance ministry and
central bank members and seven presidential picks vetted by
parliament, he said at the time.  Parliament plans to approve the draft law for the
regulator, known in the Indonesian language as Otoritas Jasa
Keuangan, or OJK, “soon,” Achsanul Qosasih, also a deputy
chairman of the working committee, said in June. The agency is
due to start operating in January 2013, he said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
