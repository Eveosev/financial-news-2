U.S. Representative  Barney Frank 
will make the short walk across Capitol Hill this week to defend
the financial-regulation law that bears his name.  Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, will testify for the
Senate Banking Committee on July 21, the one-year anniversary of
the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. As chairman of the House
Financial Services Committee, Frank and his staff played a
leading role in drafting the legislation.  “Barney is an author of the Dodd-Frank law and someone who
understands the necessity of Wall Street reforms and consumer
protections, and it will be valuable to get the insights of one
of the named architects of the bill,” Senate Banking Chairman
Tim Johnson said today.  Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat, will hold the hearing to
review progress on the law enacted by President  Barack Obama .
Federal regulators have spent the last year drafting and
implementing the hundreds of rules required by the law, which
was almost unanimously opposed by Republican lawmakers.  Frank, who lost his chairmanship in January when
Republicans took control of the House, has defended the law and
said this month that Republicans were “bluffing” in their
efforts to make major revisions or repeal the law.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman  Mary Schapiro  and acting Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman Martin J. Gruenberg are also
scheduled to testify at the Senate hearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
