Formula One Management Ltd. Chief
Executive Officer Bernard Ecclestone allegedly bribed former
Bayerische Landesbank risk manager Gerhard Gribkowsky, German
prosecutors said.  The Munich State Prosecutors’ Office has charged Gribkowsky
with corruption, embezzlement and  tax evasion , Barbara Stockinger, a spokeswoman for the prosecutors, said by
telephone.  A telephone call to the office of Gribkowsky’s attorney
Reinhard Hoess outside office hours wasn’t answered. A message
left on Ecclestone’s mobile phone wasn’t immediately returned,
while a call to his personal assistant, Enrica Marenghi, at
Formula One Management Ltd.’s London offices outside business
hours wasn’t immediately returned.  Gribkowsky was arrested on Jan. 5 over allegations that he
received about $50 million in kickbacks for engineering the sale
of BayernLB’s stake in the Formula One racing tournament to CVC
Capital Partners Ltd. Ecclestone was questioned by prosecutors
in April.  Munich prosecutors said in a statement today that
Gribkowsky is accused of taking $44 million in bribes via a
company called Bambino Trust, according to a report in the
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
