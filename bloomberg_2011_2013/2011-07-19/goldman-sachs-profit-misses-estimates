Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the U.S.
bank that makes most of its money from trading, reported second-
quarter profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates as fixed-
income revenue plunged 63 percent from the first quarter.  Net income climbed 77 percent to $1.09 billion, or $1.85
per share, from $613 million, or 78 cents, in the same period a
year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. That compares with the $2.30 per-share average
estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Earnings fell 38
percent if one-time costs are excluded from the 2010 results.  The fixed-income trading-revenue drop was more than twice
as large as at any other major U.S. bank. Overall trading
revenue at Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, fell 47 percent from the first
quarter.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s investment bank reported a
smaller-than-expected 17 percent decline in trading revenue last
week, while the same business at  Citigroup Inc. (C)  fell 21 percent.  “All the news is going to be about Goldman Sachs today
because people brought their numbers down and they still missed
those numbers,”  Paul Miller , an analyst at FBR Capital Markets,
said in an interview on Bloomberg television. “The question is
going to be why were their revenues down much greater than their
competitors? Probably they were positioned differently.”  Analysts in the Bloomberg survey reduced their earnings
estimates by an average of $1.09 per share in the past four
weeks.  Shares Drop  Goldman Sachs fell $3.33, or 2.6 percent, to $126 in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading at 9:31 a.m., the biggest
drop in the 81-company Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index.  Last year’s second-quarter earnings were reduced by a $550
million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and a $600 million expense to pay a U.K. tax on employee
bonuses. Excluding those costs, earnings would have been $1.76
billion, or $2.75 per share, in last year’s second quarter.  “Certain of our businesses had disappointing results as we
reduced our market risk in response to attempting to manage
fluctuations in prices and market liquidity,” Blankfein, 56,
said in the statement.  Value at Risk  Value at risk, a gauge of how much the firm could lose in a
single day of trading, fell for the eighth consecutive quarter,
to $101 million. The figure was the lowest since the third
quarter of 2006. The firm reduced the amount at risk to equity
prices, currencies and  interest rates , while the risk in
commodity prices jumped.  Revenue fell 39 percent to $7.28 billion from $11.9 billion
in the first quarter and $8.84 billion a year earlier. The
figure fell short of the average $8.2 billion estimate of 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Return on equity, a measure of
how well the firm reinvests shareholder funds, decreased to 6.1
percent from 12.2 percent in the first quarter.  Revenue from trading, run since February 2008 by Edward K. Eisler, David B. Heller, Pablo J. Salame and Harvey M. Schwartz,
fell to $3.52 billion from $6.65 billion in the first quarter
and was down 29 percent from $4.98 billion in the second quarter
of 2010.  “They can recover in the next couple of quarters on that
trading stuff,” said FBR’s Miller. “Trading is a very
volatile, very lumpy line.”  Fixed Income  Fixed-income, currency and commodities trading, typically
the largest source of Goldman Sachs’s revenue, dropped to $1.6
billion from $4.33 billion in the first quarter. Last week
JPMorgan, the second-biggest  U.S. bank , said fixed-income
trading revenue fell 18 percent from the first quarter to $4.28
billion. Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
fixed-income trading revenue dropped 20 percent from the first
quarter to $3.03 billion.  Roger Freeman , an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in New York,
had estimated that Goldman Sachs would generate $2.8 billion in
revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities.  The decline at Goldman Sachs reflected “significantly
lower results in mortgages, commodities and interest-rate
products,” the firm said in the statement. “In addition, net
revenues in currencies decreased slightly and net revenues in
credit products were essentially unchanged compared with the
second quarter of 2010.”  Equity Trading  Goldman Sachs’s equity-trading revenue declined 17 percent
to $1.92 billion from $2.32 billion in the prior quarter and
rose 19 percent from $1.61 billion a year earlier. That compared
with $1.22 billion of second-quarter equity-trading revenue at
JPMorgan and $812 million at Citigroup. Freeman expected Goldman
Sachs’s equities revenue to be $2 billion.  Revenue from  investment banking , overseen globally by
Richard J. Gnodde, David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg,
advanced to $1.45 billion in the quarter from $1.27 billion in
the first quarter and $941 million in the second quarter of
2010. By comparison, JPMorgan’s investment-banking fees totaled
$1.92 billion in the quarter and Citigroup reaped $1.09 billion.  Goldman Sachs’s investment-banking revenue exceeded
estimates from analysts at Atlantic Equities, Barclays Capital
and ISI Group, who expected revenue in the range of $1.2 billion
to $1.3 billion.  Goldman Sachs’s fees from takeover advice, a business led
globally by Gene T. Sykes and Yoel Zaoui, increased to $637
million from $357 million in the first quarter and from $471
million a year earlier. The firm ranks first among advisers on
mergers and acquisitions announced so far this year, according
to Bloomberg data.  Stock Underwriting  The firm also ranks first year-to-date in managing global
equity sales and initial public offerings, the data show.
Revenue from equity underwriting, overseen by London-based
Matthew Westerman, fell to $378 million from $426 million in the
first quarter, while debt underwriting revenue dropped to $433
million from $486 million in the prior three months.  Investing and lending, the segment in which Goldman Sachs
books gains or losses from the firm’s own stakes in companies
such as  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (1398)  Ltd. and other
assets, made $1.04 billion in the period, compared with $2.71
billion of gains in the first quarter and $1.79 billion in the
second quarter of 2010.  Revenue from investing and lending was more than double
what was expected by analysts at Atlantic Equities, Barclays
Capital and ISI Group. Their estimates ranged from $210 million
to $411 million.  Revenue from  investment management , the business run by
Edward C. Forst and Timothy O’Neill, was unchanged from the
first quarter at $1.27 billion and up from $1.13 billion in the
second quarter of last year. Assets under management increased
to $844 billion at the end of June from $840 billion at the end
of March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
