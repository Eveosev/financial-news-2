Chile ’s peso rose as copper prices
and European stocks rallied on speculation leaders will agree on
a second Greek bailout at a meeting on July 21, increasing
investor appetite for riskier, emerging-market assets.  The peso advanced 0.5 percent to 461.35 pesos per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:38 a.m. New York time, from 463.55 yesterday.  “It’s an improvement in risk sentiment overnight on the
expectation of a positive outcome at the EU summit on
Thursday,” said Katia Diaz, Latin American economist at 4Cast
Inc., in a phone interview. “That is boosting emerging-market
currencies like the Chilean peso.”  European Union government chiefs plan to meet for the
second time in a month on July 21, aiming to break a deadlock
over a new Greek rescue that has spooked investors. Spanish and
Italian bond yields surged yesterday, piling pressure on
officials to end the turmoil. Spain and  Greece  sold 6.08 billion
euros ($8.6 billion) of bills today.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, surged
1.8 percent to $4.47 per pound on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , hitting a three-month high.  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 462 pesos per U.S.
dollar for $50 million as part of a $12 billion effort to limit
the peso’s gains, according to data posted on the bank’s
website.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, rose one basis point to 5.60
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
