Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  claims
traded in June totaled $2.9 billion after Standard Chartered Plc
agreed to buy so-called minibonds from its Hong Kong customers,
SecondMarket Holdings Inc. said.  Asian investors’ sales to the bank of bankrupt Lehman’s
equity-linked notes accounted for 13 percent of the face value
of Lehman debt traded last month, SecondMarket said today in a
report. Trades in Lehman claims during the past 12 months topped
$29 billion, said the firm, which deals in illiquid securities.  About 43,000 Hong Kong investors bought an estimated
$1.8 billion of the minibonds from various sellers before New
York-based Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008. Investors
protested almost daily outside bank branches in  Hong Kong ,
banging cymbals and blaring pre-recorded statements from
bullhorns after they were offered repayments of at least 60
cents on the dollar in 2009.  Separately, Lehman said this month that creditors holding
more than $100 billion in claims gave their support to the
company’s latest payout plan.  Once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank, Lehman
filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008, with assets of
$639 billion. It failed partly because of too much leverage,
which it tried to hide, and risky real estate bets, said a
bankruptcy examiner.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
