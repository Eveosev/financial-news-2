The final development costs of the
London 2012 Olympics will probably decline to 7.25 billion
pounds ($11.7 billion), the organizers said today.  The estimate of the final cost is down by 16 million pounds
since May, when the last estimate was made, according to an e-
mailed statement from the U.K. Department for Culture, Media and
Sport. The cost for the Olympics and the Paralympic Games
remains at 9.3 billion, the agency said.  The Olympics will start July 27, 2012. Construction of
infrastructure and venues is 88 percent complete, and the
baseline budget has been decreased by 870 million pounds since
it was set in November 2007, the agency said.  “The people who have worked on the venues have done a
remarkable job to deliver top quality facilities in a
challenging environment imposed by a fixed deadline and strict
budget,” Sports minister Hugh Robertson said in the statement.
“They have continued to drive down costs which means we can
celebrate one year to go with confidence.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
