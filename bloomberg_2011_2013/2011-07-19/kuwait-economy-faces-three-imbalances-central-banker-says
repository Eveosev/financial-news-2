Kuwait ’s economy is struggling with
“three imbalances,” including an over-dominant public sector
and a state budget dependent on oil revenue, Central Bank
Governor Sheikh Salem AbdulAziz Al-Sabah told CNBC Arabia.  “Kuwait has no control over its revenues because this
depends on the oil market,” Sheikh Salem told the television
channel in an interview today. The country’s expenditures are
“increasing drastically” and its labor market needs to find
jobs for 20,000 Kuwaiti graduates this year, he said.  “There won’t be any growth without improving the economic
environment,” Sheikh Salem said. “It’s hard for any investor
to enter the market without a clear vision” of Kuwait’s
economy, he said.  The local general financial situation is “good and
excellent, but that’s not enough,” he said. “We need to
achieve long-term goals according to a reviewed and achievable
plan.”  Salem also said the central bank and  Capital Markets
Authority  are negotiating over their respective supervisory
responsibilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
