Tropical Storm Dora strengthened in
the eastern Pacific after forming off the coast of  Mexico 
yesterday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  The storm is located about 360 miles (580 kilometers)
south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico, and is moving west at
around 14 miles per hour, the center said in an  advisory  issued
at 11 p.m. Miami time yesterday. Dora may become a hurricane
today.  Dora’s maximum sustained winds were near 60 miles per hour
“with higher gusts,” while its storm-force winds extended
outward as far as 105 miles, the center said. “Life-
threatening” surf swells are expected to affect the coast of
south Mexico today.  Bret, the second tropical storm of the  Atlantic hurricane
season , weakened slightly as it moved northeast away from the
Bahamas, the center said in a separate  advisory . The system
still has a chance of strengthening today.  Bret was about 160 miles north of Great Abaco Island in the
Bahamas and was moving north-northeast at about 7 mph, the
center said. Sustained winds dropped to 60 mph. The government
of the Bahamas has discontinued tropical storm warnings.  A disturbance becomes a named storm when sustained winds
reach 39 mph. A storm reaches hurricane status when winds
increase to 74 mph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
