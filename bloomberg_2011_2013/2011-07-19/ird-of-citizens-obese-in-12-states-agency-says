At least 30 percent of people in 12
states were obese in 2010, an increase of three states from a
year earlier, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.  No state reported that less than 20 percent of adults were
obese, the Atlanta-based agency said today in a statement. That
means no state met the national Healthy People 2010 goal to
lower the prevalence to 15 percent.  The South had the  highest rate of obesity , with 29.4
percent, and the West had the lowest, of 24.1 percent, the CDC
report said. Medicare and Medicaid, the government health plans,
each spend more than 20 percent of their budgets to treat
illnesses related to obesity and smoking, avoidable health
risks, according to the Trust for America’s Health and the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Obesity is also a death risk,
said  Thomas Frieden , the CDC director, in today’s report.  “Some of the leading causes of death are obesity-related -
- heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and certain types of
cancer,” Frieden said in the statement today. “We must
continue our efforts to reverse this epidemic.”  In 2000, no states had obesity rates higher than 25 percent
or more of the adult population. In 2009, there were nine states
with an obesity prevalence of 30 percent or more.  Obesity is defined as having a body mass index above 30. A
6-foot-tall adult man weighing 221 pounds (100 kilograms) or
more is considered obese, as is an adult woman standing 5 feet,
6 inches tall weighing 186 pounds or more, according to the  U.S.
National Institutes of Health . People with obesity are at higher
risk for diabetes and hypertension, according to the CDC.  The states with 30 percent or more prevalence of obesity
are Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky,  Louisiana ,  Michigan ,
Mississippi, Missouri,  Oklahoma ,  South Carolina , Tennessee,
 Texas  and  West Virginia , according to the CDC report.  Today’s data come from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System, a telephone survey of about 400,000 people
older than age 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
