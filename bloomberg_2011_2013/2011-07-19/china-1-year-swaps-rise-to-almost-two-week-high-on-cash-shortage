China ’s one-year interest-rate swaps
rose the most in four weeks on speculation the central bank will
step up efforts to withdraw capital.  The People’s Bank of China issued 5 billion yuan ($773
million) of one-year bills and 25 billion yuan of 28-day
repurchase agreements today, according to a statement on the
central bank’s website. A total of 55 billion yuan of central
bank bills and repurchase contracts will mature this week, the
least since the five days ended Feb. 4, according to Wee-Khoon Chong, a Hong Kong-based fixed-income strategist at Societe
Generale SA.  “The overall concern about liquidity is pushing up swap
rates,” Chong said. “The sale of the  repurchase agreements 
shows the central bank is keen to withdraw liquidity.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose eight basis
points to 3.95 percent as of 5:10 p.m. in  Shanghai , the biggest
increase since June 21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese banks paid record  interest rates  for treasury
deposits from the government today, reflecting the rising
borrowing costs driven by the cash crunch. The lenders paid 6.03
percent for 30 billion yuan of three-month deposits the central
bank offered at an auction on behalf of the  finance ministry .
The yield was higher than the 5.9 percent at a six-month deposit
auction in June.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, advanced 10 basis points to 4.64 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. The overnight repo rate surged 82
basis points to 4.49 percent, the highest level since July 8. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Anil Varma  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
