Middle East crude oil grades for
sale to  Asia  narrowed discounts to their benchmark prices as
refinery profits remained higher than average after fires shut
plants in  China  and  Japan .  Murban for September loading climbed 6 cents to a discount
of 12 cents a barrel to its official selling price, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News. Qatar Marine was unchanged at a
discount of 20 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  Support for these grades increased as PetroChina Co. shut a
crude distillation unit at its Dalian plant after a fire on July
16 and JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp said today it would cut
processing at its Mizushima-A refinery in western Japan
following an accident yesterday.  Reduced production at the two plants supported processing
profits in the region. Gasoilâ€™s premium to Dubai, a measure of
profitability, was at $19.08 a barrel today, above the three-
month average of $18.93, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based broker.  Oman crude for immediate loading rose 23 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $111.18 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in September climbed 0.2 percent to $110.62. Murban
increased 0.3 percent to $114.88.  Oman futures for September delivery rose 44 cents to
$111.04 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:15 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,470 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $110.87 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The September Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which
measures the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf
grade, widened 13 cents to $5.55 a barrel, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates. The exchange for swaps for October rose
7 cents to $5.13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
