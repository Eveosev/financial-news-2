Gasoline strengthened in  New York 
amid maintenance at North Atlantic Refining’s Come by Chance
refinery in Newfoundland and as higher prices in  Europe  reduced
incentive to ship the fuel abroad.  The work on a crude unit and an isomax unit at the 115,000-
barrel-a-day plant, owned by Korea National Oil Corp., is
expected to be completed and the units restarted by the end of
July, Gloria Slade, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Gasoline’s premium over crude in Europe widened to $8.48 a
barrel from $8.36 yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a crude and refined products broker in  London .  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor rose 1.37 cents to 5.25 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:05 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained
4.85 cents to $3.1847 a gallon.  Completion of work at the Newfoundland refinery was
scheduled earlier for the middle of July, according to Slade.
The plant has access to U.S. and European markets.  The same fuel in the Gulf Coast widened its discount to
futures 0.4 cent to 3 cents a gallon.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  plans to restart a crude unit next week
at its Texas City refinery that was shut after a July 13 leak,
Steven Lee, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  BP Plc (BP)  will resume operations at an ultracracker unit at
its Texas City refinery, according to a filing with state
regulators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
