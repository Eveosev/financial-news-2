Woolworths Holdings Ltd., the South
African food and clothing retailer, gained to the highest price
in more than 13 years after saying full-year profit rose more
than analysts estimated.  The stock climbed as much as 3.1 percent to 31.80 rand, the
highest intraday level since at least Oct. 21, 1997, and traded
at 31.71 rand as of 11:38 a.m. in Johannesburg.  Earnings per share for the year through June 26 climbed  20
percent to 30 percent, Woolworths said in a regulatory filing
today. The median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a gain of 18 percent to 1.89 rand a share. The company
intends to release results on about Aug. 25.  South African consumer spending, which accounts for two-
thirds of demand in the economy, rose in the second quarter, the
 Reserve Bank  said on June 21. Retail sales rose at the fastest
pace in almost four years in April, increasing 9.8 percent from
a year earlier, Statistics South Africa said on June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
