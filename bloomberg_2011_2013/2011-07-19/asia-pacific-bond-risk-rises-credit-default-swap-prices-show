The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2 basis points to 127 basis points
as of 8:58 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.
Thatâ€™s the highest since Sept. 2, according to CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
privately negotiated markets.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 1 basis point to
128 basis points as of 10:57 a.m. in Sydney, the highest since
Aug. 31, according to Deutsche Bank and CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1.75 basis points to
126.75 as of 9:57 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
