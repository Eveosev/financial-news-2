Poland’s zloty strengthened against
the  Swiss franc  for the first time in eight days, rebounding
from the weakest on record, as speculation  Europe  will resolve
its debt crisis boosted investor demand for riskier assets.  The zloty gained as much as 2.1 percent and traded up 1.6
percent at 3.4559 per franc by 5 p.m. in Warsaw. Yesterday it
reached 3.5417, the weakest on record. Against the euro, the
zloty added 0.5 percent after losing 0.7 percent yesterday.  European stocks rose from a seven-month low after Novartis
AG’s better-than-estimated earnings and International Business
Machines Corp.’s profit forecast. The euro strengthened after
Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said an agreement is
“attainable” at a summit of European leaders in two days.  “The market optimism was spurred by a combination of
better-than-expected earnings results, hopes that European
policy makers would reach a solution on  Greece  this Thursday --
reducing the euro risk premium -- and the outlook for the U.S.
debt ceiling negotiations,” currency strategists at Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. wrote in a report to clients today.  The zloty and  Hungary ’s forint fell to record lows versus
the franc yesterday amid concern the debt crisis may hamper the
export-led economic recovery in emerging Europe. The retreat
pushed the 14-day relative strength index for the zloty-franc
and forint-franc pairs to 30, a level that suggests to some
technical analysts a security may gain. The RSI rose to 37 for
both currencies today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
