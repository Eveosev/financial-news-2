U.K. Minister for Trade and
Investment  Stephen Green  said talk of nationalization in  South
Africa  would not deter British investment in Africa’s largest
economy.  “British businesses are very active here,” Green said in
an interview in Johannesburg yesterday during a trade mission
led by Prime Minister David Cameron. “They want to take part in
what is a growing market. Of course they look at all the risks
and take them into account, but this is a great environment.”  The youth wing of the ruling African National Congress
party is pushing for the nationalization of South Africa’s mines
and banks, and the seizure of farms without compensation. The
threat is putting off some investors and jeopardizing job
creation,  Mark Cutifani , chief executive officer of  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the continent’s largest gold producer, said last
week.  South Africa’s government has repeatedly countered the
calls for nationalization by emphasizing that it isn’t
government policy.  ANC Youth League President Julius Malema on July 16 said
critics of nationalization are not offering an alternative to
ensure that the country’s black majority benefits economically
from the end of white minority rule in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
