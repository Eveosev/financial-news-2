Kenya , East Africa’s biggest
economy, plans to spend as much as $50 billion over the next 20
years to cope with 13.5 percent annual growth in electricity
demand, the Energy Regulatory Commission said.  Electricity demand is forecast to reach 16,905 megawatts by
2031 from 1,520 megawatts next year, Frederick Nyang, director
of economic regulation, told reporters in the capital, Nairobi,
today. He didn’t say who would invest the funds.  Under the plan, about 27 percent of electricity generated
will be from geothermal sources by 2031, 24 percent from nuclear
plants and 24 percent from coal-fired plants. Imported
electricity will provide another 13 percent of power, while
hydropower plants account for 5 percent, down from 50 percent at
present, Nyang said.  The plan also includes the construction of 10,345
kilometers (6,428 miles) of transmission lines, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
