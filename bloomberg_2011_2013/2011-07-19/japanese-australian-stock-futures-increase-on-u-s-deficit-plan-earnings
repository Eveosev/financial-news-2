Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose on optimism U.S. lawmakers will reach an agreement
that will help the world’s largest economy avoid defaulting on
its sovereign debt and after  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s profit topped
estimates, boosting the earnings outlook for exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s largest carmaker that gets 28 percent of revenue in
 North America , gained 0.9 percent from the closing share price
in Tokyo. Those of  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , Japan’s third-biggest company
by sales, rose 1 percent. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company and Australia’s No. 1 oil producer,
advanced 0.6 percent after commodity prices increased.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,995 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,890 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,000
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX
200 Index climbed 1.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
gained 0.6 percent in Wellington.  “People are feeling less anxious about a default and the
economy in the U.S.,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager
in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “Strong earnings in the
U.S. are good for Japanese companies’ profit outlook.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1
percent today as Apple’s profit topped estimates on record
iPhone and iPad sales. The index rose 1.6 percent to 1,326.73
yesterday as President  Barack Obama  endorsed a deficit-reduction
plan.  Debt Plan  Obama embraced a $3.7 trillion debt-cutting plan by a
bipartisan group of senators that would combine tax increases
and spending cuts, saying it could end a congressional deadlock
over raising the U.S. borrowing limit. The news spurred optimism
that lawmakers will reach an agreement that will help the nation
avoid default.  The plan is “a very significant step,” Obama said.  California-based Apple, the world’s biggest technology
company by market value, reported profit in the third-quarter
increased to $7.79 a share from a year earlier, exceeding the
$5.87 predicted by analysts on average. Sales climbed 82 percent
to $28.6 billion.  Housing starts in the U.S. rose more than forecast in June
to the highest level in five months. Work began on 629,000
houses, a 15 percent increase from May, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday. The level of starts exceeded the most
optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
Building permits, a sign of future construction, unexpectedly
climbed 2.5 percent.  Oil Rises  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 5.5 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 4.2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.4 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500
and 10.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for August delivery climbed 1.6 percent to $97.50
a barrel in  New York  yesterday, the highest settlement since
July 13, amid growing optimism that the economy of the world’s
biggest oil-consuming country will grow after the better-than-
expected housing starts and earnings reports.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum advanced 1.7
percent yesterday.  The yen depreciated to 79.28 against the dollar, compared
with 79.03 at the close of stock trading in  Tokyo  yesterday.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to 112.17 from
111.26. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
