Colombia ’s peso gained, nearing a
three-year high, as foreign direct investment reached a record
in June on flows into the oil and mining sectors.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 1,754.5 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:30 a.m. New York time, from 1,757.48 yesterday. The peso
touched 1,742.5 on July 15, the strongest level since July 2008.
The peso has jumped 9.1 percent since March 1 through yesterday,
the best performance among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  “The flows of oil and mining investment have kept the peso
isolated from risk in European markets and from the U.S. debt
ceiling debate,” said Daniel Escobar, analyst at Global
Securities SA. “This level is sensitive for several industries,
and we wouldn’t be comfortable with more peso gains in the short
term.”  Foreign direct investment in June rose 89 percent from a
year ago to $1.6 billion, with 84 percent going into oil and
mining, according to the central bank. That topped January’s
$1.37 billion as the highest one-month investment flow recorded
by the bank, according to statistics dating back to 1999.  Deposits in Colombia, South America’s third-largest crude
producer, have attracted billionaires  Carlos Slim  of Mexico and
 Eike Batista  of  Brazil  as the nation opens unexplored swaths of
the country to tap new energy reserves.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.87 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.170
centavo to 116.970 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
