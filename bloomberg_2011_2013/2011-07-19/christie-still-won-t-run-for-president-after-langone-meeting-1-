New Jersey Governor Chris Christie
said he still doesn’t plan to run for president in 2012 after
Kenneth Langone, co-founder of Home Depot Inc., urged him to
enter the race.  “I’ve known Ken a long time” and consider him a friend,
Christie told reporters today in Trenton. He said the meeting
with Langone, a Republican, was “no different from a lot of
meetings” he’s had with people asking him to run against
President  Barack Obama , a Democrat. He declined to say who else,
if anyone, was at the meeting.  “There are some people who believe that I should leave
this job and go for another one,” said Christie, a first-term
Republican. “I’m always willing to sit and listen to folks who
want to make that argument to me, but I said nothing different
to him today than I’ve said to other folks in the past.”  Christie, 48, has become a rising national star in the
 Republican Party  after he cut $10 billion in spending on
schools, pensions and local aid in his first budget. He has said
repeatedly that he has no plans to run for president next year.  News of the meeting between Christie and Langone was
reported earlier by Politico. The website said the meeting was
in  Manhattan .  Langone, now chairman of investment bank Invemed Associates
LLC, wasn’t reachable for comment, his assistant, Pam Goldman,
said earlier today. “It’s a private meeting that Ken’s
holding,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
