Petrobank Energy & Resources Ltd. (PBG) ,
the Canadian oil developer with projects in three provinces,
will reach full production at a C$100 million ($105 million)
bitumen-extraction project in Saskatchewan in 12 months, Chief
Financial Officer Peter Cheung said.  The Kerrobert facility will have output of 7,000 barrels a
day with reserves of 3 million barrels, Cheung said today in a
telephone interview. The project will be profitable with
production of as few as 200 barrels a day, he said.  The company, based in Calgary, is using a technology that
injects air into underground reserves to recover more of the
oil, he said.  Petrobank gained the most in more than two years, climbing
C$1.97, or 15 percent, to C$15.16 at 4 p.m. on the Toronto Stock
Exchange. It was the biggest increase since November 2008.  Saskatchewan has  Canada ’s second-largest reserves of oil,
including bitumen deposits in the northwest of the province and
the Bakken formation in the southern region, according to the
 National Energy Board . About 95 percent of Canada’s crude
reserves are in the neighboring province of  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
