Indonesia ’s rupiah gained, snapping
a two-day decline, on speculation global funds are buying the
nation’s assets to take advantage of growth in  Southeast Asia ’s
biggest economy. Bonds rose.  Indonesia may win an upgrade for its sovereign  credit
rating  to investment grade in the next 12 months to 18 months,
 Fitch Ratings  said today, citing the country’s strengthening
external balance sheet. Overseas investors bought $36 million
more Indonesian shares than they sold yesterday, taking net
purchases this month to $495 million, exchange data show.  “Funds are coming into Indonesia’s capital markets because
the general sentiment is positive,” said Lindawati Susanto,
head of treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “The
economic fundamentals look good so the currency is quite
stable.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.1 percent to 8,553 against the
dollar as of 3:10 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has advanced 5 percent this year.  Foreign funds increased their holdings of government debt
by 2.8 percent this month through July 15 to 241.48 trillion
rupiah ($28.2 billion), according to  debt management office  data.
The economy may expand 6.3 percent to 6.8 percent in 2011,
compared with 6.1 percent last year, Bank Indonesia Governor
Darmin Nasution said July 12.  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds rose. The yield on the
8.25 percent securities due July 2021 fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 7.29 percent, according to mid-day
prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
