China ’s stocks fell, driving down
the benchmark index by the most in a week, on concern banks’
fundraising will drain capital from existing shares and policy
tightening measures may slow the economy.  China  Merchants Bank  Co., the nation’s sixth-largest
lender, dropped to a one-month low on plans to raise as much as
35 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in a rights offer to shareholders
in China and  Hong Kong . SAIC Motor Corp. and FAW Car Co. slid 2
percent after Sinolink Securities Co. said more local
governments may introduce measures to limit car purchases to
ease traffic congestion.  “Fundraising by banks will further drain liquidity from
the market and lead investors to worry about the health of the
banking industry,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China
Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “Policy tightening will be there
for a while.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, dropped 19.71 points, or 0.7 percent,
to 2,796.98 at the 3 p.m. close. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  fell 0.9
percent to 3,095.13.  The Shanghai measure has slipped 0.4 percent this year
after the central bank raised  interest rates  five times and the
reserve-requirement ratio 12 times since the start of 2010 to
stem inflation. Consumer prices rose 6.4 percent in June, the
fastest pace in three years, as food costs increased.  Rights Offer  Merchants Bank lost 1.4 percent to 12.80 yuan, the lowest
close since June 20. The bank will offer 2.2 shares for every 10
existing shares held by investors, it said in a statement
yesterday. The bank said it will set pricing later.  China Construction Bank Corp. (601939) , the country’s second-largest
bank, lost 0.4 percent to 4.88 yuan. Bank of China Ltd., the
third largest, fell 0.3 percent to 3.10 yuan.  Chinese banks are raising capital to meet higher adequacy
requirements from the China Banking Regulatory Commission. The
agency said in April it will raise the minimum ratio for “non-
systematically important banks” to 10.5 percent from 8 percent.
Lenders’ minimum core capital adequacy requirement was more than
doubled to 8.5 percent from 4 percent.  A 32-member measure of consumer discretionary stocks slid
1.7 percent today, the most among the CSI 300’s 10 industry
groups. SAIC, China’s largest carmaker, retreated 2 percent to
18.03 yuan, trimming its gain to 23 percent this year.  FAW Car, which makes passenger cars in China with
Volkswagen AG, lost 2 percent to 14.31 yuan. Chongqing Changan
Automobile Co., the Chinese partner of Ford Motor Co. and Mazda
Motor Corp., fell 1.7 percent to 5.18 yuan.  Rebound to Falter  Auto stocks don’t have “momentum” for further gains given
the “sizeable” rebound they have made, Wu Wenzhao, an analyst
at Sinolink Securities Co., wrote in a report today. The policy
uncertainty the  auto industry  is facing is increasing after the
southwest city of Guiyang in Guizhou province introduced
purchase restrictions, according to the report.  U.S. stocks declined yesterday amid President  Barack
Obama ’s efforts to get lawmakers to agree to a deficit-cutting
deal as the deadline for raising the debt ceiling nears.
European shares also fell on concern the region’s banks may have
to raise as much as 80 billion euros ($113 billion) of
additional capital as stress tests failed to allay investor
concern about a Greek default and governments’ ability to bail
out their lenders.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
