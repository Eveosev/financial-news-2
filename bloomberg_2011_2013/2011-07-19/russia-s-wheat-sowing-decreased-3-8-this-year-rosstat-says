1 million hectares (2.47 million acres), or 3.8 percent, in 2011
compared with a year earlier, Russia’s  Federal State Statistics
Service  said.  The service, known as Rosstat, didn’t give the overall size

and legumes rose 1.2 percent, or by half a million hectares, to
44.1 million hectares, Rosstat said today in an e-mailed
