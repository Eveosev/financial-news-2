close in Lagos, according to an e-mailed statement from the

biggest power producer, gained for the first day in 12, climbing
0.25 shillings, or 2.1 percent, to 12 shillings, after sinking
below a key level of an indicator used in technical analysis.  Kenya Electricity’s 14-day relative strength index closed
at 9.06 yesterday, below the 30 level that signals to some
technical analysts a security is poised to rise. The RSI
identifies possible turning points in indexes or securities by
measuring the degree that gains and losses outpace each other in
a given period. It rose to 18.66 today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH)  , the nation’s largest
leisure operator by market value, dropped to its lowest since
Sept. 27m falling 0.5 rupees, or 0.5 percent, to 99.50 rupees,
on speculation the European debt crisis will affect tourism and
the company’s revenue.  “NMH fell below the psychological level of 100 rupees,
driven by the debt concerns in  Europe , its main tourist market,
which might impact on the group’s revenue in the short term,”
Kishen Nadassen, a senior research analyst at the Port Louis-
based Cim Stockbrokers Ltd., said by phone today from the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
