Spain  sold 4.45 billion euros ($6.3
billion) of treasury bills, just below its maximum target, and
its financing costs surged as European leaders struggled to find
a solution to the Greek crisis.  The Treasury in Madrid said it sold 3.79 billion euros of
12-month bills at an average yield of 3.702 percent, compared
with 2.695 percent the last time the securities were sold on
June 14. It also issued 661 million euros of 18-month debt at an
average yield of 3.912 percent, compared with 3.26 percent last
month. It was aiming to sell a maximum of 4.5 billion euros.  Demand for the 12-month bills was 2.18 times the amount
sold, compared with 2.85 last month, and the bid-to-cover for
the longer-maturity debt was 5.49 times, compared with 3.91.  Spanish and Italian borrowing costs climbed to the highest
since the start of the single currency yesterday amid discord
among European policy makers over whether private investors
should contribute to a second Greek bailout. As growing
expectations of a Greek default push up Spain’s borrowing costs,
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero urged European
leaders last week to solve the crisis without involving  Greece ’s
creditors.  Spain didn’t sell debt last week, as yields surged
following credit-rating downgrades of Greece and Ireland. The
Treasury plans to sell as much as 2.75 billion euros of 10-year
and 15-year bonds on July 21.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield fell to 6.17 percent today,
below yesterday’s intraday record of 6.37, the highest in the
euro’s lifetime and more than twice what  Germany  pays to borrow
for the same period.  The gap between Spanish and German borrowing costs narrowed
after the sale to 346 basis points from as wide as 368 before
the auction. The spread reached a euro-era record of 376 basis
points on July 12, compared with an average of 15 basis points
in the first decade of monetary union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
