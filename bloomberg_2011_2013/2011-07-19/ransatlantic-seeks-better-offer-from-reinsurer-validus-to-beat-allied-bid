Transatlantic Holdings Inc. (TRH) , the
reinsurer that agreed to merge with Allied World Assurance
Company Holdings AG, said it will ask  Validus Holdings Ltd. (VR)  to
improve its counteroffer.  Validus said last week that it would offer Transatlantic
stock owners 1.5564 Validus common shares and $8 in cash for
each share they hold. That valued the offer at about $3.5
billion, based on New York-based Transatlantic’s 62.4 million
shares outstanding as of March 31.  Transatlantic agreed last month to merge with Allied in a
stock transaction valued at $51.10 a share, or about $3.2
billion. Transatlantic’s biggest shareholder, Davis Selected
Advisers LP, said on June 14 it may oppose the deal and approach
other companies about alternatives.  “The Validus proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a
superior proposal,” Transatlantic said today in a statement.
The Validus offer “does not constitute a ‘superior proposal’
under the merger agreement that Transatlantic entered into with
Allied World.”  Jonathan Doorley, a spokesman for Bermuda-based Validus,
didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.  “We agree with today’s decision by Transatlantic’s board
that the unsolicited proposal set forth by Validus does not
constitute a superior proposal,” Scott Carmilani, chairman and
chief executive officer of Zug, Switzerland-based Allied World,
said in a separate statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
