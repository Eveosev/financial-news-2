About 7,000 contractors of  Pacific
Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC) , the Toronto-based oil producer that
operates fields in  Colombia , are protesting in the central state
of Meta to demand a pay raise, Caracol radio reported.  Negotiations for an accord to boost pay after the
contractorsâ€™ hours were increased failed yesterday, the radio
station reported on its website, citing Timoteo Romero, head of
the Central Unitarian Labor Union in Meta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
