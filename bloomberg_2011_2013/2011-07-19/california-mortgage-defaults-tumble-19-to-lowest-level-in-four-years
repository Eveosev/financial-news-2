Home-mortgage defaults in  California 
fell 19 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier to the
lowest in four years as lenders changed foreclosure policies and
price declines slowed, according to  DataQuick .  A total of 56,633 default notices were recorded statewide
in the three months through June, down 17 percent from the first
quarter and the lowest number since the second quarter of 2007,
the San Diego-based data company said today in a statement.  The drop mirrors a deceleration of the slide in California
home values, DataQuick said. Defaults peaked at 135,431 in the
first quarter of 2009, when the statewide median price fell
almost 40 percent.  “Homeowner distress spreads fastest when home price
declines are steepest,”  John Walsh , DataQuick’s president, said
in the statement. “It now appears likely that, barring some new
economic shock, the worst of the price declines are behind us.”  The median price of a California home was $250,000 in the
three months through June, down 7.4 percent from a year earlier.  Most loans going into default in the second quarter
originated in 2005 to 2007, a period that has shown the worst
loan performance for more than two years, according to the data
seller. JPMorgan Chase & Co. had the most loans in foreclosure
at 9,422, followed by  Wells Fargo & Co . at 8,228 and Bank of
America Corp. at 7,601, DataQuick said.  Mortgage lenders in the U.S. have changed their foreclosure
policies in response to investigations by federal regulators and
state attorneys general into bank documentation errors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
