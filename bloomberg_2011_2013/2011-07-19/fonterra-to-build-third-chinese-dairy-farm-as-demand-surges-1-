Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the
world’s largest dairy exporter, plans to develop a third dairy
farm in  China  amid surging demand in Asia.  The Auckland-based company agreed with Yutian County’s
government to build the farm, which will increase Fonterra’s
milk production in China to about 90 million liters a year, it
said in an e-mailed  statement . Fonterra will invest $40 million
in the project in  Hebei Province , the company said.  Fonterra is developing dairy farms in China as rising
incomes and population fuel demand for protein-rich diets in
that nation and other  emerging markets . Global food prices
advanced for the 10th time in the past year in June, according
to United Nations data.  “Demand for milk in China is expected to triple over the
next ten years, and much of this demand is for liquid and fresh
milk,” Fonterra China President Philip Turner said in the
statement. The company will build more farms in Hebei in the
next five years, according to the statement.  The 41-hectare farm will hold about 3,200 cows that will
produce around 28 million liters of milk per year, Fonterra said
in the statement.  Fonterra , with NZ$16.7 billion ($14 billion)
in annual sales, accounts for almost 40 percent of the global
trade in dairy products.  To contact the reporter for this story:
