What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 12 cents to 15 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after a government report
yesterday showed U.S. crop conditions worsened last week,  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana,
said in a telephone interview. Hot, dry weather this week will
increase the stress on plants, he said.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that hot, dry weather will continue
next month, when plants in the U.S. begin to set pods and fill
them with beans, Gerlach said. Soybean-oil futures are expected
to open 0.45 cent to 0.65 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal
futures may open up $3 to $4 for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 22 cents to 26 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that adverse weather in parts of
Europe, Russia and Ukraine may damage maturing crops, and that a
return to La Nina weather conditions may reduce yield potential
in the Southern Hemisphere later this year, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
