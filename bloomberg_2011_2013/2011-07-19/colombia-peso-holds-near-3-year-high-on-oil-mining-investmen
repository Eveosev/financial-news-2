Colombia ’s peso held near a three-
year high, as foreign direct investment reached a record in June
on flows into the oil and mining sectors.  The peso fluctuated between gains and losses before closing
little changed at 1757.35 per  U.S. dollar  at 3:18 p.m. New York
time, from 1,757.48 yesterday. The currency closed at 1,748.5 on
July 14, the strongest since July 2008. It has jumped 9.1
percent since March 1, the best performance among 25 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The flows of oil and mining investment have kept the peso
isolated from risk in European markets,” said Daniel Escobar,
analyst at Global Securities SA. “This level is sensitive for
several industries, and we wouldn’t be comfortable with more
peso gains in the short term.”  Foreign direct investment in June rose 89 percent from a
year ago to $1.6 billion, with 84 percent going into oil and
mining, according to the central bank. That topped January’s
$1.37 billion as the highest one-month investment flow recorded
by the bank, according to statistics dating back to 1999.  Deposits in Colombia,  South America ’s third-largest crude
producer, have attracted billionaires  Carlos Slim  of Mexico and
 Eike Batista  of Brazil as the nation opens unexplored swaths of
the country to tap new energy reserves.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said Europe’s fiscal crisis
can’t be solved in one go, damping expectations that government
leaders may resolve the region’s debt woes at a July 21 summit.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.86 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.09
centavo to 117.05 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
