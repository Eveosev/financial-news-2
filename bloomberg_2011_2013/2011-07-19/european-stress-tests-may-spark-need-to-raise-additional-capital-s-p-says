European banks may seek to raise
additional capital after last week’s stress tests revealed their
riskiest investments and showed a need to curb their dependence
on governments, ratings company  Standard & Poor’s  said.  “The stress test process is likely to add further impetus
to banks’ capital raising efforts in the lead-up to the
implementation of Basel III,” Richard Barnes, a London-based
credit analyst said in a report today. “Sovereign support
remains an important rating factor for many European banks.”  The stress tests on 90 European banks published on July 15
showed eight lenders had a combined 2.5 billion-euro ($3.5
billion) capital shortfall. Shares of European lenders across
the region slumped yesterday as the tests failed to ease concern
they remain vulnerable to a potential sovereign default.  The tests by the European Banking Authority showed that 16
percent of the 1 trillion euros of core tier 1 capital held by
lenders came from government, S&P said. The data on lenders’
holdings of sovereign debt showed how governments depend on
domestic lenders to fund their deficits, Barnes said.  “The unwinding of this interdependency is likely to be
difficult and take an extended period of time,” he wrote.  Standard & Poor’s doesn’t plan to revise any it its ratings
based on the release of the stress tests, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
