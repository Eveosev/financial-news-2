Hungary’s government plans to
transfer “most” tasks currently performed at county levels to
the state to help rein in their debt,  Vilaggazdasag  reported,
without citing anyone.  The new municipality law that the Cabinet is drafting will
leave development matters at the county level, while other
functions which produce losses may be taken over by the central
government, along with the subsidies which finance the counties,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
