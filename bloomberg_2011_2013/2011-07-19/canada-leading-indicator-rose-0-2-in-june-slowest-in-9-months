Canada’s index of leading economic
indicators rose in June at its slowest pace in nine months as
stock prices fell and manufacturing output stalled.  The index rose 0.2 percent, Ottawa-based  Statistics Canada 
said today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted the
index would rise 0.8 percent, based on the median of nine
estimates. The gain is the smallest since September, when the
index posted a 0.2 percent drop.  Economic growth may have slowed to less than 2 percent in
the second quarter in part because of factory disruptions linked
to natural disasters in  Japan , according to Bank of Canada
Governor  Mark Carney .  None of the index’s three manufacturing components recorded
gains, with much of the weakness occurring in the automobile
industry as the Japan disaster disrupted supply chains,
Statistics Canada said. A measure for the average workweek at
manufacturing sites recorded a 0.3 percent drop, while new
factory orders were unchanged.  The index’s measure of Canadian stock prices decreased 0.4
percent, Statistics Canada said.  Furniture and appliance sales led gains on the index with a
1 percent increase. Measures of business and personal services
employment and housing gained 0.3 percent.  Four of the index’s 10 components decreased in June, two
were unchanged and four rose. The statistics agency also revised
its estimate for May to a 0.8 percent gain, down from 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
