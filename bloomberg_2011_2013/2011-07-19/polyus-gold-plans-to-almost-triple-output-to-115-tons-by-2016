OAO Polyus Gold,  Russia ’s largest
gold producer, said it plans to increase output to 115 metric
tons by 2016.  Polyus commented in a statement, citing a development
strategy approved by its board yesterday. Production was 43 tons
in 2010, previous filings from the company show.  Polyus aims to produce more than 137 tons of the precious
metal by 2020, when the company’s Natalka processing plant will
reach capacity of 40 million tons of ore per year, it said.  Polyus may spend as much as 37.5 billion rubles ($1.3
billion) by 2016 on developing four new deposits in Siberia that
are intended to increase annual gold production by 20 tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
