Renova Energia SA (RNEW11) , the Brazilian
renewable energy company, may become the nation’s biggest
producer of wind power by 2016 using the proceeds from selling a
26 percent stake to the state-controlled utility Cia. Energetica
de  Minas Gerais .  Renova may develop as much as 1.3 gigawatts of wind farms
over the next five years, Pedro Pileggi, investor relations
officer for the Sao Paulo-based company, said in an interview.  The new projects may catapult it to the top spot in
 Brazil ’s wind market, ahead of its largest competitor CPFL
Energias Renovaveis SA, a joint venture formed in April that
combines the renewable energy assets of utility CPFL Energia SA
and developer ERSA-Energias Renovaveis SA, he said.  “Wind projects are, right now, our most competitive
projects,” Pileggi said yesterday in an e-mail. “We’d be the
biggest” power producer “in terms of wind electricity
generation.”  Cemig’s  Light SA (LIGT3)  unit paid 360 million reais ($230 million)
for the stake in Renova. The investment, announced July 8,
included an agreement by the Rio de Janeiro-based utility to
purchase electricity from 400 megawatts of planned Renova wind
farms, half of which are expected to come online by 2015 and the
other half in 2016, he said.  Renova’s power contracts averaged 121 reais a megawatt-hour
in a government-organized auction last year for new renewable
energy projects, and Pileggi said the Light agreement “was more
or less in line with that signed by us in previous auctions.”  August Energy Auction  Renova registered 424 megawatts of wind farms in an auction
scheduled for next month that are expected to come online by
2014, he said.  CPFL Energias Renovaveis has 210 megawatts of wind farms in
operation and 296 megawatts under construction, and it’s
planning another 1,472 megawatts, according to a company
presentation.  It’s unlikely that CPFL Energias Renovaveis will have more
than 1,300 megawatts online by 2016, Helena Chung, an analyst at
Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said yesterday by phone. “It may
be close, but I don’t think it will happen,” she said.  CPFL didn’t reply to an e-mail seeking comment.  Brazil has 51 wind farms amounting to about 1 gigawatt of
installed capacity, up from 587 megawatts at the end of 2009,
according to New Energy Finance. The national energy agency
Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica expects to have 12 gigawatts
online by the end of the decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
