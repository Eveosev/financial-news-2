Ghana ’s cedi strengthened for the
third day in four as investors sought the currency before the
first auction of five-year bonds in West Africa’s second-biggest
economy since 2007.  The currency of the world’s biggest cocoa producer after
 Ivory Coast  appreciated to 1.5135 as of 12:30 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, from yesterday’s close of 1.5140, according to data
compiled by the local unit of Barclays Bank Plc.  “As we approach next week’s auction of five-year bonds,
offshore investors bought the cedis in readiness for the sales,”
said Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at Barclays Bank Ghana
Ltd., by phone today.  The Bank of Ghana will offer 300 million cedis ($198
million) on July 28, according to a prospectus published on its
website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
