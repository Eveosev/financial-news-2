Hong Kong’s  unemployment rate  held
close to a two-year low, supporting economic growth and retail
spending in the city.  The jobless rate for the three months through June was 3.5
percent, matching the median estimate of 14 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The government released the data on its
website today.  The city raised in May its economic growth forecast for
this year to as much as 6 percent from a previous range of 4 to
5 percent. Weakness in the  U.S. economy  and the European
sovereign debt crisis may crimp the expansion by restraining
demand for exports.  “Tourism and retail sales are doing very well,” said
Raymond Yeung, a senior economist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in  Hong Kong . The unemployment rate will
improve “at a very gradual pace,” Yeung said.  -- With assistance from Michael Munoz and Marco Lui. Editor:
