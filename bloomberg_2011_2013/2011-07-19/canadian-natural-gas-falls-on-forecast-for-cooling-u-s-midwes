Canadian natural gas fell on
forecasts that a heat wave in the U.S. Midwest will ease,
trimming demand for the power-plant fuel.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, dropped 1.7
percent as MDA EarthSat Weather’s forecast for July 24 to July
28 said a cold front is expected “early in this time frame from
the Midwest to East.” This week will be one of intense heat
with temperatures over 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) from
 Chicago  to Boston, said MDA, of Gaithersburg, Maryland.  “We’ve run this thing pretty hard and there’s a little
profit-taking here with anticipation it can’t stay hot forever
and we still have a fair amount of supply on hand,” Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at INTL FCStone Inc. in
St. Louis Park, Minnesota, said in a telephone interview.
“Unless we have hot weather like this until October, which is
not going to happen, I think we’ll stay relatively stagnant for
a while.”  Alberta  gas for August delivery declined 6.25 cents to
C$3.545 per gigajoule ($3.53 per million British thermal units)
as of 2:35 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. September gas fell 6.5 cents to C$3.54. Gas
traded on the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and
is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas in New York fell 1.3 cents to settle at $4.533
per million Btu on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Chicago Heat  Cooling demand in Chicago will be about 69 percent more
than normal until at least July 26, said Weather Derivatives,
based in Belton, Missouri.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S.
gas supplies, according to the Energy Department.  The high in Chicago today may reach 93 degrees, 8 above
normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of  State College ,
Pennsylvania.  Boston ’s highs will reach the mid-90s the day
after tomorrow, the forecaster said.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.5 billion cubic
feet as of 1:30 p.m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.82 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.85 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 870 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.89 billion cubic feet today, about 68 percent of its
capacity of 2.76 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
rose 1.5 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $4.7053 per million Btu as of
1:28 p.m. New York time on the Intercontinental Exchange.
Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic
feet a day to the Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 3.52 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $4.2060.  To contact the reporter on this story:
