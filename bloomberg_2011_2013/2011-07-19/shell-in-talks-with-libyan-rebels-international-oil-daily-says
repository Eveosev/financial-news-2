Libya’s rebel movement is talking
with companies including  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  about supplying
fuel to the country should the government of Muammar Qaddafi
fall, Energy Intelligence Group’s International Oil Daily said,
citing Guma El-Gamaty, the rebels’ representative to the U.K.  The rebels’ Transitional National Council would also like
to resume crude oil exports of up to 300,000 barrels a day by
next month out of Tobruk, mostly from the Sarir and Messla
fields, the newsletter said, citing El-Gamaty. The fields are
being repaired after Qaddafi forces attacked them.  Jonathan French, a London-based spokesman for Shell,
declined to comment in a telephone interview with Bloomberg
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
