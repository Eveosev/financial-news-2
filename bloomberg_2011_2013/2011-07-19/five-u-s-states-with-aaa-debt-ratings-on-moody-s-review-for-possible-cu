Maryland ,  New Mexico  and three other
U.S. states had their Aaa debt ratings placed on review for
possible downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited its
review of the Aaa U.S. government bond rating.  South Carolina ,  Tennessee , and Virginia are also being
reviewed by Moody’s, which said downgrades would be likely
should the U.S. rating be cut to Aa1 or lower. The review covers
$24 billion of general obligations and related debt.  Ten other states with Aaa ratings are not on review,
Moody’s said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
