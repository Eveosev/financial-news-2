Czech Finance Minister Miroslav
Kalousek plans to propose raising the unified value-added-tax
rate to 19 percent to cut the 2012 budget deficit to 95 billion
koruna ($5.4 billion),  Hospodarske Noviny  said, citing him.  The minister will present the plan, which would cut next
year’s budget deficit by 10 billion koruna, to the government
this week, the newspaper said.  Public Affairs, the ruling Czech coalition party, said it
won’t support raising the VAT rate,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
