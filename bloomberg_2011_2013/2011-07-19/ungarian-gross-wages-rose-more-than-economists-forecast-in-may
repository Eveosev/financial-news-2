Hungarian wages rose more than
economists forecast in May because of rising bonus payments at
private companies and two additional working days compared with
the same month last year.  The average monthly gross wage increased 6.7 percent from a
year ago to 211,736 forint ($1,096), the Budapest-based
 statistics office  said in a statement today. The median estimate
of seven economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a 4.2 percent
advance.  Public wages rose 6.5 percent and private salaries were up
6.4 percent on the year. Regular private wages excluding
bonuses, one of the  central bankâ€™s  closely watched indicators
for determining inflation expectations, increased 4.4 percent in
May from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
