GMP Capital Inc. (GMP)  co-founder Brad Griffiths has been missing since yesterday after last being seen
at Ontario’s Lake Joseph north of Toronto, police said.  Griffiths, 55, was seen in the water in distress at about
12:43 p.m. on July 18, the West Parry Sound Ontario Provincial
Police said in an e-mailed statement. A motorboat was also seen
in the area, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Toronto,
moving without an operator.  Several people in boats searched the area without success
for the Toronto man, who wasn’t believed to be wearing a
lifejacket, police said.  A search of the waters and shoreline was unsuccessful, and
police have brought in a private diving company to search the
lake, which is about 292 feet (89 meters) deep in the spot where
Griffiths was last seen.  Griffiths and Eugene McBurney founded the predecessor
company Griffiths McBurney & Partners in 1995, according to the
company’s  website . The brokerage offered shares to the public in
December 2003.  Griffiths left the firm in 2000, according to the Globe and
Mail newspaper. He also worked for Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce and  Canaccord Financial Inc. (CF) , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
