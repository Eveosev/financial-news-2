European Union regulators rebuked
 Germany ,  France  and 18 other EU nations over late implementation
of new telecommunications rules that were scheduled to enter
into force on May 25.  The European Commission gave the countries two months to
respond to a warning over their failure to put in place the
measures, the regulator  said  in an e-mailed statement from
Brussels today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
