EQT Partners AB, the private-equity
firm partly owned by  Sweden ’s Wallenberg family, said it
appointed lenders to provide leveraged loans to back its buyout
of Atos Medical.  The debt includes senior facilities from Danske Bank A/S,
DnB NOR ASA, and Nordea Bank AB, as well as mezzanine debt from
MezzVest and Partners Group, Stockholm-based EQT said in a
statement.  EQT said today it bought the Horby, Sweden-based medical-
products supplier from Nordic Capital Svenska AB. Atos’s sales
rose by an average 16 percent per year since 2005 to 64 million
euros ($91 million) last year, according to Nordic, and it
supplies ear, nose and throat medical products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
