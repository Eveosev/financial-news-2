Vietnam ’s bonds advanced on
speculation yields at auctions may fall as pressure on the
government to sell debt eases. The dong was steady.  The State Treasury will offer 2 trillion dong ($97.2
million) each of three-year and five-year securities on July 21,
according to a statement on the Hanoi Stock Exchange’s website.  “Yields at the upcoming auctions may go down,” said Pham
Minh Hoang, a fixed-income dealer at Ocean Commercial Joint-
Stock Bank in Hanoi. “The government has already raised a lot
of money from bond sales so it doesn’t have as much selling
pressure.”  The yield on the benchmark five-year note dropped four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 12.44 percent,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was unchanged at 20,570 per dollar as of 3 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank
fixed the reference rate at 20,608, unchanged since July 11,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to
1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editor: Sandy Hendry  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
