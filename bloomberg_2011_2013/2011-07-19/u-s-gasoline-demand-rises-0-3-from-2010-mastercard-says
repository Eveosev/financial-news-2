U.S. gasoline demand rose 0.3
percent from a year earlier even as average pump prices gained
37 percent, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Motorists bought 9.37 million barrels a day in the week
ended July 15, MasterCard said in its SpendingPulse report.  Averaged over four weeks, demand fell 1.1 percent from the
same period a year earlier, John Gamel, director of economic
analysis for SpendingPulse, said in the report. It was the 17th
consecutive week that the four-week average fell below a year
earlier, Gamel said.  “We are now halfway through the U.S. summer driving season
and drivers have pumped 466.9 million barrels of gasoline, 0.6
percent less when compared to a similar period a year ago,”
Gamel said in the report.  Consumption rose 3.7 percent from the previous week when
demand slid 5.5 percent in the seven days that included the July
4 holiday, the second-biggest payments network company said.  The average pump price rose 8 cents in the period ended
July 15 from the prior week to $3.66 a gallon. It was the second
consecutive gain. Prices are 37 percent above a year earlier.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
