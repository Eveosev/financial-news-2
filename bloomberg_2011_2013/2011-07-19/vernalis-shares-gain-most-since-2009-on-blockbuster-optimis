Vernalis Plc (VER)  shares rose the most in
three months in London trading after  Novartis AG (NOVN)  called its
experimental tumor treatment a potential blockbuster.  Vernalis rose 11 percent to 42.63 pence, the biggest gain
and the highest level since April, at the close of trading in
London today, giving the maker of the frovatriptan migraine drug
a market value of 42.5 million pounds ($68.6 million).  Novartis listed the Winnersh, England-based company’s
AUY922 treatment, aimed at impeding tumor growth, as one of
seven “potential blockbusters” in a  presentation  to investors.
Novartis is licensed to undertake mid-stage trials with the
drug, which may yield as much as $40 million in royalty payments
for Vernalis, according to Singer Capital Markets Ltd.  “People should be excited,” Shawn Manning, an analyst at
Singer, said by phone. He has a “buy” rating on Vernalis and
said typically mid-stage trials have success rates of 20 percent
to 25 percent.  The drug wouldn’t be filed for regulatory approval until
2015, Manning estimates. Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis,
which today reported a 29 percent rise in second-quarter profit,
has more than 140 projects in development, according to the
presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
