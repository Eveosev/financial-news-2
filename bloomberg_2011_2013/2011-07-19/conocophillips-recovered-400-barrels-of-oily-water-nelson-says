ConocoPhillips (COP)  said it has recovered
400 barrels of oily water since it started cleaning up a spill
at  China ’s  Bohai Bay .  ConocoPhillips will wait for approval from the government
before resuming production at the field, Mark Nelson, a vice
president at Conoco’s China unit, told reporters in Penglai city
near the spill.  Cleanup work at Platform C at the Penglai 19-3 field is
causing about one liter of oil sheen a day, he said. Oil sheen
can be seen near Platform B, he said, without giving the exact
volume.  Underwater cleaning is difficult work, Nelson said. Two
dive boats have arrived at Platform C for the cleanup, and
another boat is coming to accelerate the process, he said.  ConocoPhillips has placed 1,180 meters of boom to capture
oil sheen at the two platforms, and an additional 1,020 meters
are standing by, Lu Aimin, senior manager at Platform B, told
reporters on a media tour.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
