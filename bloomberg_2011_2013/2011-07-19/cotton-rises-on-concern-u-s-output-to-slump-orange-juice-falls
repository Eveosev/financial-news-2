Cotton rose the maximum allowed by
the exchange in  New York , halting a three-session slide, on
signs that adverse weather will hamper output in the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter.  As of July 17, 28 percent of the crop was in good or
excellent condition, compared with 68 percent a year earlier,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said yesterday. The worst
drought in at least a century has damaged plants in Texas, the
biggest cotton-growing state. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of 19 raw materials rose as much as 1.5 percent today.  “The weather fears are back,”  Sid Love , the president of
Joe Kropf & Sid Love Consulting Services LLC in  Overland Park ,
Kansas, said in a telephone interview. “Overall strength in the
commodities market is also helping cotton.”  Cotton for December delivery jumped by the 4-cent exchange
limit on ICE Futures U.S., or 4.1 percent, to settle at $1.0084
a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at 2:39 p.m. in New York. The
commodity slumped 11 percent in the previous three sessions on
signs of waning demand.  Prices jumped to a record $2.197 a pound on March 7 mainly
on increased purchases by  China , the biggest importer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
