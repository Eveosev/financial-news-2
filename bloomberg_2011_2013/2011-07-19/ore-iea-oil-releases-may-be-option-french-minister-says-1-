The  International Energy Agency  may
consider further releases of oil stockpiles as a means to lower
the price of crude, French Industry Minister Eric Besson said.  No such release is currently planned, he told reporters in
Paris today following a meeting yesterday with Maria van der Hoeven, the former Dutch minister who will take over as
executive director of the IEA in September.  “For the future, nothing is programmed but we aren’t
ruling it out either,” Besson said. The agency’s decision to
sell 60 million barrels from strategic reserves over a 30-day
period, announced on June 23, had “temporary but real”
effects, he said.  The IEA, based in Paris, said last month its action was
driven by concern that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries wasn’t boosting supplies quickly enough, after it
failed to reach an accord on raising output at a June 8 meeting.
The agency also cited conflict in  Libya  and a rise in demand for
the European and U.S. summer vacation months as reasons for the
decision.  Crude for August delivery rose $1.57, or 1.6 percent, to
$97.50 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  today, the
highest settlement since July 13. Futures have risen 27 percent
in the past year.  “We are telling speculators that consumer countries could
do this at any time, without warning and without making it some
kind of ritual,” the French minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
