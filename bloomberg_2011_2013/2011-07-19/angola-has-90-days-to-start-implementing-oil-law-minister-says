Angola  has 90 days to start
implementing a law that ended  Sonangol Holdings ’ oil products
monopoly, Oil Minister Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos said.  Lawmakers in the country, which vies with Nigeria as
 Africa ’s biggest crude producer, voted today in the capital,
Luanda, to allow private companies to refine crude and
distribute, store, trade and transport oil products.  Authorities will work so that the law is implemented
“smoothly,” de Vasconcelos said in an interview.  Separately, he said the country pumped about 1.58 million
to 1.65 million barrels a day in June. “Angola’s oil production
will begin to rise starting in the last quarter,” de
Vasconcelos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
