Texas  Rangers owner  Nolan Ryan  has
been released from a Houston hospital after experiencing
discomfort from a recurring heart condition, the team said on
its website.  Ryan, 64, was hospitalized after experiencing chest pain
two days ago at his home in Georgetown, Texas, the Rangers said.
He will continue to be treated with medication, and will remain
home for a few days before returning to the team.  The Hall of Fame pitcher spent time in a hospital with
chest pains in October 2000, six months after emergency double-
bypass surgery. Ryan underwent medical tests yesterday that
indicated “no new developments” with his pre-existing heart
condition, the team said.  Ryan’s controlling interest in the Rangers was approved by
Major League Baseball owners in May. He and  Chuck Greenberg 
headed an investment group that won a bankruptcy auction in
August 2010 to buy the Rangers for $593 million. Greenberg left
the team in March, saying he and Ryan have “somewhat different
styles.”  Inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, Ryan
played 27 major league seasons from 1966 to 1993, with a 324-292
record. His 5,714 strikeouts and seven no-hitters are both
records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
