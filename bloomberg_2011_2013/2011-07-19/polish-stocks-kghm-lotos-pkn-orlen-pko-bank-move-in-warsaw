Poland ’s WIG20 Index gained 5.05, or
0.2 percent, to 2,680.72 in Warsaw, climbing from a five-month
low.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Budimex SA (BDX)  , the Polish unit of Ferrovial SA, fell
8.4 zloty, or 9.9 percent, to 76.4 zloty. The daily decline was
the steepest since April 2007 for the country’s biggest
construction company by sales. Daily volume was 12,668 shares,
or 77 percent of the average from the last three months.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, rose 0.6 zloty, or 0.3 percent, to
187.5 zloty. Copper rose to a three-month high in  London  after a
government report showed housing starts in the U.S., the world’s
second-biggest user of the metal, gained more than forecast in
June.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s largest oil refiner, fell
for an eighth day, retreating 0.59 zloty, or 1.3 percent, to
45.9 zloty for the longest losing streak since November 2007.
Crude oil gained after European Central Bank council member
Ewald Nowotny suggested the bank may allow a temporary Greek
default and on signs of shrinking crude stockpiles in the U.S.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW) advanced from a 10-month low,
climbing 0.73 zloty, or 1.8 percent, to 40.68 zloty after Poland
said it will sell as much as 15 percent of its largest bank on
the  Warsaw Stock Exchange  this year. Earlier the government said
it may sell a maximum of 26 percent in September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
