OAO Acron, a Russian fertilizer
maker, said commercial production rose 6 percent in the first
half to 2.92 million metric tons as demand from  Asia  increased
and prices for soil nutrients gained.  Nitrogen fertilizer output climbed 9 percent from a year
earlier to 1.24 million tons, the company said in a statement
today. Production of complex fertilizers, which include
nitrogen, phosphate and potash, rose 7 percent to 1.29 million
tons “on strong demand” from Asian countries.  Global prices for ammonium nitrate, a common type of
nitrogen fertilizer, rose 43 percent in the first half of 2011
from a year earlier to $309 a ton, Acron said. Prices for
complex fertilizers advanced 33 percent to $417 a ton.  Acron is benefiting from “favorable pricing” that enabled
it to cut net debt by 10 percent to 25.8 billion rubles ($915
million), it said in a June 6 filing. The company has said it
plans to spend about $2 billion by 2016 to become self-
sufficient in phosphate and potash used to produce complex
fertilizers.  Acron is seeking a stake in a natural-gas field to gain
supplies of the raw material for nitrogen production, Kommersant
said March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
