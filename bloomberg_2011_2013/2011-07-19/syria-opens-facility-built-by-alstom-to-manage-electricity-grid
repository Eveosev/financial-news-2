Syria opened a 35.6 million euro
($50.5 million) facility built by  Alstom SA (ALO)  to manage the
national  power grid .  The Damascus-based facility will control and operate 50
power generation and transfer stations, Syrian Minister of
Electricity Imad Khamis told reporters today.  “We want to expand this project to add power-distribution
stations as well,” he said. The facility will then operate 20
additional stations, he said.  London-based Parsons Brinkerhoff Inc. supervised the
construction, which was partially funded by a loan of 10 million
Kuwaiti dinars ($36.5 million) from the Arab Fund for Economic
and Social Development, according to a statement from the
Ministry of Electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
