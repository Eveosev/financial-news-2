Numerical Machining Complex, a
Kenyan state-owned machine-tool manufacturer, plans to build a
factory that will produce steel from scrap metal, President Mwai Kibaki said.  The plant will be built at Athi River, 26 kilometers (16
miles) southwest of the capital, Nairobi, Kibaki said in a
statement e-mailed by his office yesterday. NMC, as the company
is known, needs 5 billion shillings ($55.4 million) to fund its
expansion, Business Daily, a Nairobi-based newspaper reported
today.  Manufacturing is one of six industries being targeted by
 Kenya ’s government under a program that seeks to achieve an
average annual economic growth rate of 10 percent over the next
two decades to help the country reach middle-income status by
2030.  NMC may generate revenue of 30 billion shillings a year and
create “tens of thousands” of jobs if it increases capacity
sevenfold to 21 metric tons per hour, Kibaki said, without
providing further details.  Kenya’s industrialization and finance ministries have been
asked to find ways of financing the projects, which are
“critical in taking the country to the next level of
development through industrialization,” Kibaki said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
