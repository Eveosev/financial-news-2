Banco Compartamos SA, a Mexican bank
that lends to low-income populations, plans to sell as much as 2
billion pesos ($171.5 million) in debt by the end of September
to finance its expansion in Mexico,  Guatemala  and  Peru , Chief
Executive Officer Fernando Alvarez Toca said.  Compartamos is seeking a maturity of at least five years
for the bonds, Alvarez Toca said in a telephone interview. The
Mexico City-based lender hasn’t determined if the bonds will be
fixed- or floating-rate, he said. Its national long-term  credit
rating  was raised to AA from AA- by  Fitch Ratings  yesterday.  The lender is seeking markets with low banking penetration
to offer small-scale working capital loans, its top source of
revenue. Last month, it bought a controlling stake in Peru’s
Financiera Creditos Arequipa SA.  The bank is also developing its first savings product,
Alvaro Toca said. The lender started a pilot program in December
in eastern Coatzacoalcos that allows for the disbursement of the
working capital loans through debit cards.  “This is going to dictate the operations of Compartamos in
the long-term,” Alvarez Toca said. “These are our first steps
in savings.”  The program may expand nationally by the end of 2012, he
said.  Compartamos SAB, the holding company that controls Banco
Compartamos, climbed 3.9 percent to 21.03 pesos in  Mexico  City
trading today. The shares have dropped 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
