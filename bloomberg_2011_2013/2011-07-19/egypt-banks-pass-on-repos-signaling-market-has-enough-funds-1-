Egypt ’s central bank didn’t receive
bids for seven-day repurchase contracts today, indicating banks
have sufficient funds even after foreign investors pulled out of
the local government securities market.  The central bank had made 1 billion Egyptian pounds ($168
million) in repo agreements available today and received no
bids, according to data it posted on Bloomberg. A central bank
official, who declined to be identified, said no bids were
received.  “It’s a good sign,” said Moustafa Assal, head of fixed-
income at Cairo-based investment bank Beltone Financial Holding
SAE. “It means banks don’t need to refinance their positions
because there are enough Egyptian pounds in the system.”  Foreign investors sold treasury bills valued at 34.7
billion pounds in the first four months of the year, according
to central bank data, amid the uprising that ousted President
 Hosni Mubarak  in February. That left local investors to buy
Egypt’s local currency debt at weekly auctions. The central bank
started the repurchase facility in March to ease pressure on
local banks, allowing them to sell the securities back for one-
week at an interest rate of 9.25 percent.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 fell three basis points to 5.69 percent at 4:50 p.m.
in Cairo. The pound’s 12-month non-deliverable forwards indicate
the pound will weaken 10 percent to 6.62 per dollar from the
current spot rate of 5.9583.  To contact the reporter on this story:
