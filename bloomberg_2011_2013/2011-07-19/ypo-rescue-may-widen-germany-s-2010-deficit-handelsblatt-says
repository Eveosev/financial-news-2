Germany ’s deficit for 2010 may widen
by about 0.5 percent after the government’s rescue of Hypo Real
Estate Holding AG, Handelsblatt reported, citing unidentified
government officials.  Germany’s deficit for 2010 is estimated to be about 3.3
percent of GDP, the newspaper said. The Federal Office for
Government Statistics will publish amended data on Sept. 1,
Handelsblatt reported. The revision will follow a decision by
the European Commission yesterday approving and revaluing the
German-government rescue of Hypo Real Estate, according to
Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
