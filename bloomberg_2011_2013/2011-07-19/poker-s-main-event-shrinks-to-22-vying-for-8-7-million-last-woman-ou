Anton Makievskyi leads 22 players
after Day 7 of the  World Series of Poker ’s main event following
a 10-hour session that saw well-known pros and the tournament’s
last female entrant eliminated.  Makievskyi, 21, from Ukraine, has just over 21 million in
chips at the $10,000 buy-in tournament in  Las Vegas , officially
known as the No-Limit Hold’em World Championship.  The average stack of chips for the players is 9.3 million
after 62 hours of poker and an opening field of 6,865. The
winner will take home $8.7 million. All players started with
30,000 in chips.  Erika Moutinho, the last of the 242 women who entered the
event at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino, was eliminated in
29th place, according to the tournament’s website. She narrowly
bested her boyfriend, David Sands, who was knocked out in 30th.
Each earned $242,636.  Poker pro Erick Lindgren was ousted in 43rd place, taking
home $196,174, while Minh Nguyen exited in 56th, making
$130,997. Tony Hachem, the brother of 2005 main-event winner Joe
Hachem, was eliminated in 37th place, earning $196,174.  Still alive is Tulsa,  Oklahoma ’s Ben Lamb, who already has
a win and a second-place finish at the 58-event  World Series 
this year. Lamb has 14.7 million in chips, which ranks fifth.  Ireland’s Eoghan O’Dea, 26, is second with 19.5 million in
chips, followed by 29-year-old Canadian Khoa Nguyen (about 16.4
million) and 21-year-old Russian Andrey Pateychuk (about 16.2
million).  The event continues today and is scheduled to play down to
nine. Those players will join the final table Nov. 5-7 to crown
a champion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
