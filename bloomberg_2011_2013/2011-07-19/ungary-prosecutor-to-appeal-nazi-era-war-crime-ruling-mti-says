A Hungarian prosecutor will appeal
against the acquittal of a World War II captain in the Hungarian
gendarmerie of war-crime charges, news service  MTI  said today.  A Budapest court yesterday cleared Sandor Kepiro of war-
crime charges in a first-instance ruling, citing lack of
evidence.  Kepiro, 97, was accused of participating in a raid by Nazi-
allied Hungarian forces on the Serbian town of Novi Sad in
January 1942, in which more than 1,200 Serbs and Jews were
murdered. He was also accused of involvement in the execution of
around 30 people who were killed on the banks of the Danube.  The prosecution finds the verdict “unfounded” and
“inconsistent,” MTI said, citing prosecutor Zsolt Falvai.  Kepiro was condemned by a military court in 1944 to 10
years of prison. Authorities later annulled the verdict and his
rank was reinstated. In 1948, Kepiro settled in  Argentina  and
returned to  Hungary  in 1996.  The prosecutor had called for Kepiro to serve time in
prison during the trial that started on May 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
