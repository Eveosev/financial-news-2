The defending-champion  Dallas
Mavericks  are scheduled to host the  Chicago Bulls  in the
National Basketball Association’s season opener -- if there is a
season.  The Mavericks-Bulls game at American Airlines Center is one
of three scheduled for Nov. 1, with the Utah Jazz hosting the
Houston Rockets and the Oklahoma City Thunder visiting the Los
Angeles Lakers later that night, the NBA said in a news release.  The other 26 NBA franchises are scheduled to open their
seasons the following day, with the LeBron James-led Miami Heat,
who lost to Dallas in six games in the NBA Finals, playing at
the  New York Knicks .  Whether these games are played depends on a labor
settlement. NBA owners lockout out players on July 1.  Three games are scheduled for the Christmas holiday on Dec.
25. The Boston Celtics play at the Knicks, followed by an NBA
Finals rematch between the Heat and Mavericks in  Dallas , and
concluding with the Bulls at the Lakers.  The last time there was an NBA lockout, in 1998, the two
sides weren’t able to reach an agreement until the following
January, shortening the season to 50 games from 82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
