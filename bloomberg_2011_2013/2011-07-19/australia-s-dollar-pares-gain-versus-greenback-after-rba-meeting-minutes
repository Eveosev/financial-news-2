Australia’s dollar pared gains
against the greenback after the  Reserve Bank  released minutes
from its July meeting.  The Aussie traded at $1.0621 as of 11:32 a.m. in Sydney
from $1.0640 before the release of the minutes. The currency
closed at $1.0607 in  New York  yesterday.  Australia’s central bank had scope to extend an interest-
rate pause because risks posed by Europe’s debt crisis and a
slower-than-forecast domestic recovery eased inflation concerns,
minutes of its July 5 meeting showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
