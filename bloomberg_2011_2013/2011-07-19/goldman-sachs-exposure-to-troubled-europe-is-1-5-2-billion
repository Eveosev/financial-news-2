Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  has about
$1.5 billion to $2 billion in net risk to the five most troubled
nations in  Europe , Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar said.  “On a net basis, our exposure is actually pretty modest”
to the five countries: Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and
Spain, Viniar said in response to an analyst’s question on a
conference call today. “Our gross exposure is not very big
either,” he added, without providing any figures.  Concerns about European countries’ creditworthiness have
accelerated in recent weeks, provoking questions about banks’
related risks. The cost of borrowing in Italy and Spain has
surged, with the Italian 10-year note yield jumping to 5.72
percent from 4.88 percent on June 30. Moody’s Investors Service
cut the ratings on Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt to junk.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-biggest U.S. bank, said
last week that it had $15 billion of net risk in those
countries, which accounts for offsetting hedges and collateral.
 Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest bank, said it has at least $22
billion in loans, trading assets and other “exposure” to the
five countries.  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  has about $3.2 billion at risk in the
five nations, Chief Financial Officer Timothy J. Sloan said on
the company’s second-quarter earnings call today. Most of that
is corporate debt rather than bonds issued by the countries
themselves, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
