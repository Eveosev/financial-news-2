Lawmakers in  Sierra Leone  approved
an agreement between Oranto Petroleum Ltd. of  Nigeria  and the
West African nation’s government to restore the company’s rights
to an offshore oil block.  The deal was passed after the International Court of
Arbitration ruled that Oranto should have the full rights to the
4,022 square-kilometer (1,552 square-mile) block, known as SL-5,
said Coleson Turay, a member of the ruling party that voted in
favor of the policy, in an interview today. The decision was
agreed by lawmakers in the capital, Freetown, yesterday, he
said.  Sierra Leone’s government tried to reduce the area that the
block covered in Oranto’s 2003 agreement, according to a
parliamentary document that was handed to reporters on July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
