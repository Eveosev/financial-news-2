Nigeria , a favored supplier of crude
to U.S. refiners, plans to ship six cargoes of benchmark Bonny
Light grade in September, down from nine in August, according to
a loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  Africaâ€™s largest oil producer will also export seven
Agbami, five Bonga, four Brass River, three EA, and seven
Forcados shipments. The sizes of cargoes range from 600,000
barrels to 1 million barrels.  Shipping plans of the remaining 13 Nigerian grades,
including benchmark Qua Iboe, will be released later this week.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
