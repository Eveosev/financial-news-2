Soc. Quimica y Minera de Chile SA 
rose after Larrain Vial raised its share price estimate for
 Chile ’s biggest fertilizer producer on prospects of higher
global potassium prices.  Soquimich, as the company based in Santiago is known, rose
1.6 percent to 30,530 pesos at 4 p.m.  New York  time.  The shares may reach 34,600 pesos in 12 to 18 months,
Larrain Vial analysts wrote in an e-mailed note to clients
today, reiterating a “buy” recommendation. They previously
forecast 30,300 pesos, according to Bloomberg data. Soquimich is
expanding its capacity to produce the plant nutrient as rising
demand combined with supply-side limitations keep the global
market “tight,” Larrain Vial said.  “The main driver of the update is a better outlook for the
potassium market,” the analysts wrote. “We expect potassium
prices to continue gaining force in the coming months.”  Global fertilizer stocks, including Soquimich shareholder
 Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc ., rose as rallying crop and
energy prices signaled increased demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
