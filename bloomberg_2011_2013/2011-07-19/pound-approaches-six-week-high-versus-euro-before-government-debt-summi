The U.K. pound strengthened against
the euro, heading toward the strongest level in more than six
weeks, before a summit of European leaders this week that
investors say may decide the fate of the European currency.  Sterling was little changed versus the dollar. European
Union government chiefs plan to meet for the second time in a
month on July 21, aiming to break a deadlock over a new Greek
rescue. Italian and Spanish 10-year bond yields surged to euro-
era records yesterday while German bunds rallied as contagion
from the sovereign-debt crisis spread, piling pressure on
 Europe ’s leaders to contain the turmoil.  The pound climbed 0.2 percent to 87.71 pence per euro as of
7:42 a.m. in  London , after reaching 87.05 pence yesterday, the
strongest level since May 31. It traded at $1.6069 from $1.6058
yesterday.  Britain’s currency has dropped 6.8 percent in the past 12
months against nine developed-market peers tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, the second biggest
decline after the dollar’s 12 percent drop.  To contact the reporters on this story:
