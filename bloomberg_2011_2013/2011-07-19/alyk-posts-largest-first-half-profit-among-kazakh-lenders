AO Halyk Savings Bank, controlled by
President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s daughter and son-in-law, posted
the biggest first-half profit among Kazakh banks.  Net income rose to 18.06 billion tenge ($123.4 million)
from 17.07 billion tenge in January-June 2010, the Almaty-based
central bank’s financial oversight committee said in a monthly
report on its website. Profit in June was 4.14 billion tenge.
The figures are based on unconsolidated data calculated in
accordance with Kazakh accounting standards.  Halyk said in March its 2011 profit may rise 24 percent as
lending increases and loan quality improves. Lower provisions
against bad debt will free up cash and lift net income to as
much as 45 billion tenge, Chief Executive Officer Umut Shayakhmetova said at the time.  The following table shows the six-month performance of
 Kazakhstan ’s six largest lenders, along with 14th-ranked
Temirbank, and their position as of July 1. The data from the
oversight committee are in billions of tenge:  To contact the reporter on this story:
