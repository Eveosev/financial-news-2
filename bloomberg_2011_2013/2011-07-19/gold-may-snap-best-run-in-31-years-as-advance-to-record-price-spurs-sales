Gold may rise for an 11th day after
touching a record in the longest winning streak since at least
1975 as debt concerns in  Europe  and the U.S. spur demand for a
protection of wealth.  Bullion held in exchange-traded products yesterday climbed
0.9 percent to 2,120.5 metric tons, the most ever, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. European government leaders plan to gather in
Brussels this week to break a deadlock over a new Greek rescue
that has spooked investors. President  Barack Obama  vowed to veto
a Republican proposal to impose mandatory budget cuts as U.S.
officials struggle to reach agreement on how to avoid a default.  “Europe’s debt is a time bomb and while the U.S. will
eventually settle the current debt issue, there still exists a
lot of uncertainties in that market,” Hou Xinqiang, an analyst
at Jinrui Futures Co., said by phone from Shenzhen,  China .
“Gold’s safe-haven properties have been in play recently and
ever since the global recession in 2008, it has become a vital
part of most people’s investment portfolio.”  Gold for August delivery gained as much as $8.30, or 0.5
percent, to $1,610.70 an ounce and traded at $1,603 by 8:26 a.m.
on the Comex in  New York . Prices are up for an 11th day, the
longest rally since at least January 1975. Immediate-delivery
gold was 0.1 percent lower at $1,602.75 in London after reaching
a record $1,610.10.  Gold is up 13 percent this year, heading for an 11th
straight annual gain, the longest winning streak since at least
1920 in  London . The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
gained 1.4 percent in 2011, the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of
24 commodities is up 9.8 percent and Treasuries returned 3.5
percent, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
