Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared
wireless venture may disrupt  Europe ’s planned space-based
navigation system and pose a risk to aviation safety, a European
Commission official told U.S. regulators.  Analysis by the European Space Agency has found that
signals from LightSquared’s network may cause “harmful
interference” to the Galileo system, Heinz Zourek, head of the
commission’s industry department, said in a letter today to
Federal Communications Commission Chairman  Julius Genachowski .  The commission also is concerned that LightSquared may
affect navigation equipment on aircraft that operate in European
and U.S. airspace, Zourek wrote in the letter, which was posted
on the agency’s website. He urged the FCC to weigh those
concerns as it considers final approval for LightSquared, which
proposes serving 260 million wireless subscribers over a network
of 40,000 base stations.  Zourek’s concerns echo objections to LightSquared raised by
makers and users of navigation devices that operate on the U.S.
global-positioning system. The GPS industry says that the
Reston, Virginia-based company’s service may overwhelm their
signals, which come from satellites, and interfere with
aircraft, boats, tractors and cars.  LightSquared said on June 30 that it wouldn’t use all the
airwaves allocated to it, cutting interference to more than 99
percent of GPS devices. The FCC is taking comments on the
revised plan until Aug. 15 and faces no deadline to act.  New LightSquared Plan  The commission’s letter “is focused on LightSquared’s
former plan,” Chris Stern, a company spokesman, said in an
interview. “LightSquared is very confident that its solution
will resolve any issues about interference.”  Neil Grace, an FCC spokesman, had no immediate comment.  LightSquared, backed by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital
Partners hedge fund, plans to invest $15 billion to build a
wholesale wireless service.  Harbinger has invested $2.2 billion in LightSquared, and
the investment represents 62 percent of Harbinger’s main fund,
the  investment company  told investors in May. It said Harbinger
owns about 80 percent of LightSquared’s shares.  The GPS industry has urged the FCC to revoke the
preliminary approval it granted in January to LightSquared and
make the company use different airwaves.  Earlier tests showed LightSquared’s original plan “poses a
significant potential for harmful interference” and concerns
“remain unresolved,” Larry Strickling, head of the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration wrote in a
July 6 letter to the FCC.  More Testing  Strickling, who is President  Barack Obama ’s principal
adviser on telecommunications issues, said he supports a call
for more tests made by the National Executive Committee for
Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing, an advisory
panel that includes defense and transportation deputy
secretaries and other executive-branch officials.  On June 30 LightSquared filed a technical report with the
FCC, and the agency in a public notice said the document showed
“potentially significant interference” between LightSquared
operations and GPS when using airwaves near GPS, and “some
interference issues” when airwaves further away were used.  Deere & Co. (DE) , the largest farm-equipment maker, and GPS
maker  Garmin Ltd. (GRMN)  said LightSquared’s new plan didn’t allay
concerns about disruption to GPS.  To contact the reporters on this story:
