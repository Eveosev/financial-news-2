Boliden AB (BOL) , a Swedish copper and
zinc producer, said it raised second-quarter profit 6.5 percent
on higher prices, while ramping up output at its largest mine.  Net income grew to 803 million kronor ($123 million) from
754 million kronor a year earlier, the Stockholm-based company
said today in a  statement . That missed the 899 million-kronor
average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
advanced 11 percent to 9.89 billion kronor.  Boliden achieved a 32 million-metric-ton annual output rate
at its Aitik mine in the second quarter, Chief Executive Officer
Lennart Evrell said on a conference call. The company has solved
issues with crushers at the mine, its biggest, and is set to
achieve a 36 million ton capacity by 2014, he said.  Boliden also benefited from a recovery in demand for metals
and higher prices. Copper averaged $9,137 a metric ton in the
quarter on the London Metal Exchange, up 30 percent from a year
earlier, it said. Zinc prices rose 12 percent to $2,250 a ton.  The company gained 4.5 percent to 113 kronor by the 5:30
p.m. close of trade in  Stockholm , reversing an initial decline
of as much as 4.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
