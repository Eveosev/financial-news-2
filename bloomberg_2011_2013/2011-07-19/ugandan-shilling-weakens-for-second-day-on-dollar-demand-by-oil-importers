Uganda ’s shilling weakened for a
second day against the dollar amid demand for the U.S. currency
by domestic importers of oil and energy equipment.  The currency of East Africa’s second-biggest coffee
producer weakened 1 percent to 2,600 per dollar at 11.55 a.m. in
the capital, Kampala. It closed at 2,575 yesterday.  “There is basically corporate demand for the dollar arising
from the energy sector, both oil importers and of importers of
equipments like generators,” Benon Okwenje, a currency trader at
 Stanbic Bank Uganda Ltd. (SBU) , said by phone from Kampala.  Uganda, East Africa’s third-biggest economy, has faced
electricity shortages since July 5 after independent generators
who sell to the state-run Uganda Electricity Transmission
Company cut off supplies to the national grid over accumulated
debts, according to Umeme Ltd., the power distributor. Power
deficits forced companies to buy generators as well as oil to
fire them, Okwenje said.  Uganda’s currency is the world’s third-worst performer this
year, after Suriname’s dollar and the Maldives rufiyaa,
according to Bloomberg Data. The currency has weakened as
inflation accelerated to a 17-year-high of 16 percent in May,
before slowing to 15.8 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
