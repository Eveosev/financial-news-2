 Humor and absurdity invest the
conceptual experiments of German artist  Sigmar Polke  now being
shown at  Leo Koenig Inc .  One group of photographs stars cucumbers; another displays
random objects arranged to look like palm trees. Gold nuggets,
vines and blankets also make appearances. Depending on his
photographic development process, which included the use of
radioactive materials, the same composition might look crisp,
sepia-aged or dreamlike.  One highlight is a group of five macabre images of
mummified corpses from a Capuchin monastery in  Palermo ,  Italy .
Each shows them dressed in shirts and coats. One pair seems to
be having an interesting conversation.  Prices range from $16,000 for a single photo to $1.2
million (for all the dead people). “Sigmar Polke: Photoworks
1964-2000” runs through Sept. 3 at 545 W. 23rd St.; +1-212-334-

organized a lively group exhibition featuring abstract art by
eight women.  A co-founder of the hip emerging art space  Cleopatra’s  in
 Brooklyn , McNamara chooses paintings and sculptures that vibrate
with color.  In Joanne Greenbaum’s charged, expansive composition,
various shades of pink swirl and drip amid black and yellow.
Dona Nelson’s “Lunar Eclipse” hangs in midair, with both sides
of the canvas forming Rorschach shapes in yellow and blue.
Cheerful lemon-hued paint brings to life Nicole Cherubini’s
totem-like sculpture assembled from plywood and ceramic parts.  Prices range from $2,500 to $30,000. “Affinities: Painting
in Abstraction” runs through Aug. 19 at 525 W. 22nd St.; +1-
212-352-9460;  http://www.damelioterras.com   Woven Paintings  A few doors west,  Friedrich Petzel  is showing understated,
attractive canvases by Dutch artist Willem De Rooij.  At first they look like glittering monochromes. Five 7-foot
vertical canvases form a subtle progression from gold to silver.
One 9-foot-wide canvas shows a gradual change from brown to
black.  It takes a few minutes to realize that the color is
achieved through intricately woven threads.  Most pieces were produced at a 200-year-old weaving factory
outside of Potsdam,  Germany . Prices range from 22,000 euros to
120,000 euros ($30,918 to $168,648). “Crazy Repelled
Firelight” runs through Aug. 5 at 537 W. 22nd St.; +1-212-680-
9467;  http://www.petzel.com   Arty Horror  Moments after two lovers embrace, the man is torn apart by
four horses. More sadistic acts follow. But wait, this is all an
arty send-up of horror flicks, and optimistic too. At the end,
the woman sculpts her dead lover’s head from bread crumbs tossed
her way by a crazy priest. Love and art triumph eventually.  The silent, black-and-white movie at  Anton Kern Gallery  is
the main event of an exhibition by John Bock, who plays the
priest.  Glass vitrines on two sides of the screening room display
props used in the film, including the four horses, which turn
out to be small paper cutouts.  The entire installation is $250,000. The film, which comes
in the edition of three, is $90,000. “In the Shadow of the
Maggot” runs through Aug. 12 at 532 W. 20th St.; +1-212-367-
