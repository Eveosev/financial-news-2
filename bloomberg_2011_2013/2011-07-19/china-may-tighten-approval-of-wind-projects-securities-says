Chinaâ€™s National Energy
Administration may reinstate its control over onshore wind-power
projects with less than 50,000 kilowatts of capacity, the China
Securities Journal said, citing an unidentified person.  Currently, wind power farms of less than 50,000 kilowatts
are approved by provincial governments and only larger
facilities need approval from the central-government agency,
the Beijing-based newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
