Ethanol futures rose to a three-year
high in  Chicago  after a government report showed corn crop
conditions declined, signaling higher costs to manufacture the
biofuel.  The gasoline additive increased a day after the Agriculture
Department said U.S. corn rated in good or excellent condition
fell to 66 percent in the week ended July 17 from 69 percent a
week earlier. Corn is the primary input cost for U.S. ethanol
producers.  “It’s definitely the corn crop conditions report that came
out last night that was fairly bullish for ethanol,” said
Justin Dirico, senior ethanol trader at SCB & Associates in
Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery advanced 5.2 cents,
or 1.8 percent, to settle at $2.911 a gallon on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the highest settlement price since June 27,
2008. Prices are up 22 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  slumped 5.5
cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.995 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive lost 5.5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.925,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago increased 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.95 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel jumped 1 cent,
or 0.3 percent, to $3.125.  Corn futures for December delivery jumped 10.25 cents, or
1.5 percent, to settle at $6.8725 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $7.0375, the highest level
for a most-active contract since June 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
