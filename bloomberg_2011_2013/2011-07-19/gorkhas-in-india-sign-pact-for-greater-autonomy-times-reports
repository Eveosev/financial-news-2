Ethnic Gorkhas living in  India â€™s
Darjeeling region signed an agreement granting them greater
autonomy, bolstering efforts for peace in the Himalayan
foothills, the Times of India reported.  The pact was signed yesterday by the federal government,
the administration in the eastern state of West Bengal and the
Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, a group that has spearheaded demands for
self-rule, the newspaper said.  Under the agreement, a newly created Gorkhaland Territorial
Administration will take on extra responsibility for running the
area, which will remain part of West Bengal, the Times said.  The Darjeeling region, where the tea of the same name is
grown, has seen two decades of unrest, fueled by frequent
strikes by separatist groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
