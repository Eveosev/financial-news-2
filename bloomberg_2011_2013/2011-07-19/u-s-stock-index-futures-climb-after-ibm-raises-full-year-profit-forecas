U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its biggest rally since March, as
PresidentBarack Obama endorsed a bipartisan deficit-reduction
plan. Equity futures rose after U.S. markets closed as  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s profit topped estimates on record iPhone and iPad sales.  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  and Coca-Cola Co.
climbed 5.7 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively, as they led a
group of companies reporting higher-than-estimated earnings. All
12 stocks in an S&P gauge of homebuilders advanced after U.S.
housing starts increased to a five-month high.  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  fell 1.5 percent after reporting the biggest quarterly
loss in its history.  The S&P 500 gained 1.6 percent to 1,326.73 at 4 p.m. in New
York, rebounding from a three-week low. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  advanced 202.26 points, or 1.6 percent, to 12,587.42.
Nasdaq-100 Index futures contracts expiring in September climbed
0.7 percent to 2,405.25 at 5:07 p.m. in New York.  “It’s a combination of the good corporate earnings and the
market is looking for a relief rally from debt-ceiling and
deficit negotiations,” said Eric Teal, chief investment officer
at First Citizens Bancshares Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina,
which manages $4 billion. “Obama’s support reduces the risk
there’s no deal by Aug. 2. It shows both sides are working hard
to get a deal.”  Debt Worries  The  S&P 500  declined 4.3 percent through yesterday from a
three-year high in April amid speculation that the sovereign
debt crisis in  Europe  is spreading across the region and concern
that U.S. lawmakers will fail to reach a deal on raising the
nation’s debt limit before the Aug. 2 deadline. The drop has
left the gauge trading at 15 times reported earnings, the
cheapest this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 has still rallied 96 percent since March 2009
as the  Federal Reserve  maintained a policy of record-low
 interest rates  and emergency stimulus to spur growth in the
world’s largest economy.  U.S. stocks extended gains as Obama embraced a $3.7
trillion debt-cutting plan by a bipartisan group of senators
that would combine tax increases and spending cuts, saying it
could end a congressional deadlock over raising the U.S.
borrowing limit. The news spurred optimism that lawmakers will
reach an agreement that will help the nation avoid default.  The plan is “a very significant step,” Obama said in
remarks at the White House.  Earnings Season  Positive earnings reports pushed shares higher earlier.
Among the 41 companies in the S&P 500 that posted results since
July 11, 35 beat the average analyst estimate for per-share
profit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Nasdaq futures rallied after Apple reported profit in the
third-quarter was $7.79 a share, exceeding the $5.87 predicted
by analysts on average, as the Cupertino, California-based
company had record sales of iPhones and iPad tablets. The shares
rose 5.7 percent to $398.21.  Yahoo! Inc., the most-visited U.S. Web portal, reported
after the U.S. market closed that sales fell short of estimates
as marketers shunned its pages in favor of rival sites. The
shares slipped 1.6 percent to $14.36.  IBM, the biggest computer-services company, climbed 5.7
percent to a record $185.21, for the largest advance in the Dow
during regular trading. The Armonk, New York-based company
reported sales that beat analysts’ estimates and lifted its
profit forecast amid buoyant demand for software. Second-quarter
revenue rose 12 percent to $26.7 billion. That topped $25.4
billion, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Technology Rally  Technology stocks were the best performers among 10 groups
in the S&P 500, rising 2.7 percent, the most since July 2010,
following IBM’s better-than-estimated earnings. Microsoft Corp.
jumped 3.6 percent to $27.54,  Intel Corp . climbed 3.5 percent to
$23.06,  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  increased 3.7 percent to $32.64 and

soft-drink maker posted second-quarter earnings and sales that
exceeded the average analyst estimate, helped by sales in  Latin
America  and  Asia . The company also said it plans to buy back at
least $2.5 billion worth of shares by the end of the year.  Goldman, Bank of America  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  slumped 0.7 percent to $128.49
after earlier falling as much as 3 percent. The fifth-biggest
 U.S. bank  by assets reported second-quarter profit that fell
short of analysts’ estimates as fixed-income trading revenue
plunged 63 percent from the previous quarter. Net income was
$1.85 a share, compared with the $2.30 per share average
estimate of analysts in a survey.  Bank of America declined 1.5 percent to $9.57, the worst
performing stock in the Dow. The bank reported a quarterly loss
of $8.83 billion, the biggest in its history, as it booked more
costs tied to defective mortgages and revenue continued to
slide.  Homebuilders advanced after housing starts in the U.S. rose
more than forecast in June to the highest level in five months,
led by a surge in multifamily dwellings. D.R. Horton Inc.
climbed 5.7 percent to $11.93.  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  gained 6.6 percent
to $18.52. PulteGroup Inc. rose 3.5 percent to $7.18.  Housing Starts  Work began on 629,000 houses at an annual pace, up 15
percent from the prior month, figures from the Commerce
Department showed. The level of starts exceeded the most
optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
Building permits, a sign of future construction, unexpectedly
climbed 2.5 percent.  Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG)  rallied 8.9 percent to $45.11, the
biggest gain in the S&P 500. The largest U.S. motorcycle maker
reported a 37 percent increase in profit, beating analyst
estimates, as it boosted home market sales for the first time in
almost five years and said it will ship more bikes than
previously planned.                           News Corp. (NWSA)  rose 5.5 percent to $15.79. Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch told U.K. lawmakers that he
wasn’t responsible for the phone-hacking scandal at New Corp.’s
News of the World newspaper, saying that the blame lies with the
“people that I trusted to run it.”  The company is considering elevating Chief Operating
Officer  Chase Carey  to chief executive officer to succeed
Murdoch, said people with knowledge of the situation. A decision
hasn’t been made, said the people, who weren’t authorized to
speak publicly. News Corp. shares dropped 17 percent from July 5
through yesterday.  Mosaic Co. (MOS)  gained 3.1 percent to $68.49. North America’s
second-largest fertilizer producer posted earnings and sales
that exceeded the average analyst projection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
