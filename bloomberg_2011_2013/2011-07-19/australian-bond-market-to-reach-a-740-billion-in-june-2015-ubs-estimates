The Australian  bond market  may grow
44 percent to about A$740 billion ($785 billion) by June 2015,
led by increases in debt sales from regional governments and
corporate issuers, UBS AG said.  State government outstanding borrowings will climb A$86
billion, while corporate bonds will rise A$60 billion and
federal securities will increase A$42 billion,  Matthew Johnson ,
a Sydney-based bond strategist for UBS, wrote in a note to
clients. The Australian bond market will have increased by about
A$500 billion between June 2008 and June 2015, according to the
analyst.  Both federal and state bond markets “will be characterized
by a tight supply-demand dynamic for some time -- even in the
case where unexpected economic weakness results in supply that
is higher than we forecast,” Johnson wrote.  Overseas buying of federal and state bonds coupled with
increased demand from bank balance sheets will absorb the higher
borrowings, he predicted. The  Australian Prudential Regulation
Authority  said on Feb. 28 that only so-called semi-government
and sovereign bonds qualify as liquid assets banks need to hold
under Basel Committee on Banking Supervision standards coming
into force by 2015.  Outstanding debt for the Federal government stood at
A$191.3 billion as of June 30, according to data from the
 Australian Office of Financial Management . The total borrowings
of the nation’s six states and the Northern Territory are
A$173.7 billion, according to Bloomberg data.  6.4 Percent Return  Australia ’s government bond market has gained 6.4 percent
this year, including reinvested interest, the best return after
 New Zealand , among 20 developed markets tracked by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. State bonds have risen 6.5
percent.  As Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s government returns to a
 budget surplus  by 2013 and state borrowings slow, the
composition of the UBS composite bond index for the nation will
begin to “tilt away from government,” Johnson wrote. The share
of federal and state debt will fall to 60 percent of the index
by June 2015 from about 64 percent in the 12 months ended June
30, 2011, according to the strategist. The proportion had
climbed from about 48 percent in June 2007.  Supranational and state-backed borrowers issuing in
Australian dollars will increase debt sales by about A$37
billion, Johnson wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
