EON AG,  Germany ’s biggest power
utility, sold a group of wind farms in  France  to a company
backed by Riverstone Holdings LLC, a New York-based private
equity group, as part of a program of asset divestments.  EON sold the portfolio of early-stage development projects
across France to  Velocita Energy Developments , a London-based
wind energy company funded by Riverstone, Jonny Stokes, a
spokesman for EON, said today by phone from Dusseldorf. He
declined to give financial details.  “France remains a key focus country for EON’s renewable
activities,” Stokes said. The sale forms part of a company plan
to sell 15 billion euros ($21 billion) of assets by the end of
2013 to cut debts and fund international expansion, he said.  The projects may add a potential 750 megawatts of wind
power in the nation, which is  Europe ’s fourth-largest wind
market by installed capacity, trailing Germany, Spain and Italy,
according to EON.  To contact the reporters on this story:
