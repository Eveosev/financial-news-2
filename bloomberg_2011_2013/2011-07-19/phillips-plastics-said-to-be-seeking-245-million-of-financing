Phillips Plastics Corp., a provider
of design and manufacturing services for medical and commercial
applications, is seeking $245 million of loans to back it’s
acquisition of Medisize Corp.  Phillips, which is  owned  by private equity firm Kohlberg &
Co., is seeking a five-year, $45 million revolving line of
credit and a 5.5-year, $200 million term loan, according to a
person with knowledge of the terms.  GE Capital Markets, the lending unit of  General Electric
Co. (GE) , and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA are arranging the debt and are meeting
with lenders tomorrow to discuss the terms, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the details are private.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  Phillips agreed to acquire Medisize, a European-based
outsource provider of design and manufacturing services to
pharmaceutical, diagnostic and medical device companies, from
Ratos AB July 8. The acquisition is expected to be completed by
the end of August, according to a  news release .  Lori Feiten, a spokeswoman for Hudson, Wisconsin-based
Phillips, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
