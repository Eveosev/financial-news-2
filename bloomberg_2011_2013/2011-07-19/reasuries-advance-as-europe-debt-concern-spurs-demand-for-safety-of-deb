Treasuries advanced as the debt
crisis in  Europe  fueled demand for the relative safety of
shorter-maturity debt.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note dropped two basis
points to 2.91 percent as of 6:57 a.m. in  London , according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent note maturing in
May 2021 gained 5/32 to 101 26/32.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
