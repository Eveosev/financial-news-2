Rwandatel SA, Rwanda’s third-biggest
mobile-phone operator that had its operating license revoked in
April, should be liquidated, according to Richard Mugisha, its
temporary administrator.  “My findings were that it was not possible to turn around
the company because to do so would require a substantial
injection of cash,” Mugisha told reporters today in the
capital, Kigali.  A Rwandan court ordered Mugisha to take over the Libyan-
owned company in May after regulators in the East African
country said it was “technically insolvent.”  Rwandatel will sell assets worth about $50 million as a
package to another telecommunications company, Mugisha said,
without saying which companies had shown interest in buying the
assets. Rwandatel has about $88.9 million in debt, he said.  The company will continue to offer fixed-line phone and
Internet services while sales are negotiated, Mugisha said. A
creditors’ meeting will be held no later than Aug. 4 in line
with a court ruling and creditors must submit their claims by
Aug. 31, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
