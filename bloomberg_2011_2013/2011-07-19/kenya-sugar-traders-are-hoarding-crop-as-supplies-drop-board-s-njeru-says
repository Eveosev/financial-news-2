The  Kenya  Sugar Board, which
regulates the nation’s industry, said it suspects traders in the
East African country are hoarding supplies to sell at a higher
price as drought reduces production.  “We suspect that traders are hoarding sugar waiting for
prices to shoot up,” said Patricia Njeru, the board’s head of
planning, by phone today from the capital, Nairobi.  Kenya consumes 780,000 metric tons of sugar a year and
produces 520,000 tons, leaving a deficit of 260,000 tons,
according to Njeru.  To contact the reporter on this story:
