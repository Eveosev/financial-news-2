Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,  Australia ’s
second-biggest oil and gas producer, said second-quarter sales
rose 17 percent on higher prices.  Sales rose to $1.25 billion in the three months ended June
30, from $1.07 billion a year earlier, Perth-based Woodside said
today in a statement. This compared with a UBS AG forecast of
$1.13 billion. Production dropped 7 percent to 16.3 million
barrels of oil equivalent.  Woodside last month boosted its cost estimate for the Pluto
liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia by 6.4
percent to A$14.9 billion ($15.8 billion), the third increase
since November 2009. First cargoes are now due in March 2012,
compared with an earlier target of September, according to
Woodside, which attributed the delay partly to bad weather.  Woodside rose 0.1 percent to A$38.30 at 10:16 a.m. Sydney
time on the Australian stock exchange.  The company hasn’t reached a decision on placing orders for
the planned expansion of Pluto, Woodside said. Work on the
Xeres-1 discovery couldn’t be completed in the second quarter
because of “technical difficulties,” and a decision on testing
has been deferred until later this year, it said.  Woodside said it plans to drill the Kelt-1 and Noblige-2
wells in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
