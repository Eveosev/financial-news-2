Colombia ’s peso fell for the second
day in three as concern that the global economy is slipping into
a recession hurt appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-market
assets.  The peso plunged 1.5 percent to 1,917.33 per  U.S. dollar  at
2:16 p.m. New York time, from 1,888.25 yesterday. It touched
1,933 on Sept. 26, its weakest level since December. The peso
has slipped 6.4 percent in the past month amid concern Greek
insolvency is inevitable and Europe can’t contain the damage.  “Nothing is clear on the international front,” said Juan Camilo Santana, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Cia. de
Profesionales de Bolsa SA. “We’ve seen a lot of volatility as
the market prices in policy expectations, but we have yet to see
decisive action.”  European Commission President Jose Barroso today called for
faster creation of a rescue fund and said he will press ahead
with proposals for common bonds for the euro area. Officials
from the European Commission,  European Central Bank  and
 International Monetary Fund  will return to Athens tomorrow to
review the Greek government’s budget-cut plans, the commission
said.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to
7.58 percent. The bond’s price fell 0.837 centavo to 119.349
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
