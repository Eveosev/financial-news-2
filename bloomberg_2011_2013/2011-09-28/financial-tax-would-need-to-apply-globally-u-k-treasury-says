Any tax on financial transactions
would need to apply globally and “there are a number of
practical issues that need to be worked through,” the U.K.
Treasury said in a statement today.  The European Union today proposed a financial-transactions
tax that would take effect in 2014 and raise about 57 billion
euros ($78 billion) a year.  The plan would set minimum tax rates for financial
transactions throughout the 27-nation EU, the European
Commission, the EU’s Brussels-based executive, said today in a
statement. It would assess trading of stocks and bonds at a 0.1
percent rate, with a 0.01 percent rate for derivatives
contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
