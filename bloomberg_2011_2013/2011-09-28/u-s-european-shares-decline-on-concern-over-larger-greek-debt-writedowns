U.S. stocks erased early gains and
European equities extended declines, while the euro trimmed its
advance against the dollar, amid concern that holders of Greek
bonds will suffer larger losses than previously agreed upon.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3 percent at
10:33 a.m. in  New York  after rallying as much as 0.8 percent
earlier. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 1.2 percent. The euro
was up 0.2 percent at $1.3608 after rallying 0.8 percent
earlier. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities slumped 0.9 percent
as oil extended its decline after the U.S. government reported
an increase in crude supplies.  The European Commission is resisting a push to impose
bigger writedowns on banks’ holdings of Greek government debt
than those agreed at a July 21 summit, a European official said.
The commission, the European Union’s executive body, opposes
ideas that are being floated by some government officials to get
banks to accept bigger so-called haircuts and doesn’t want to
have talks about any such attempt, the official said on
condition of anonymity because the deliberations are private.  Germany  and the Netherlands are leading a drive by as many
as seven euro-area countries for more private-sector involvement
in the second Greek package, the Financial Times reported today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
