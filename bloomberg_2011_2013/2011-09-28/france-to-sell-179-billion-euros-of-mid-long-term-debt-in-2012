France  plans to scale back its
medium and long-term bond sales by 2.7 percent next year as
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  seeks to squeeze the  budget deficit .  The government plans to sell 179 billion euros ($244
billion) next year, down from 184 billion euros, Agence France
Tresor said today in an e-mailed statement from Paris.  The issuance plan reflects the governmentâ€™s commitment to
cut the deficit to 81.8 billion euros, or 4.5 percent of gross
domestic product, from 95.6 billion euros, or 5.7 percent of
output this year. They also cover the redemption of 98.9 billion
euros of outstanding bonds.  France has cut its outstanding Treasury bills by 4.4
billion euros in 2011 and will do so by another 1.1 billion
euros next year. The government so far this year has bought back
18 billion euros of medium- and long-term debt maturing in 2012,
the AFT said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
