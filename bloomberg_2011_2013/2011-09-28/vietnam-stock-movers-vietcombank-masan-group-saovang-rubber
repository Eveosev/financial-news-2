Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  Vietnam  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, lost 0.8 percent to 433.97, the lowest level in
this month.  Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for  Foreign Trade  of Vietnam
(VCB VN), the country’s biggest listed lender by market value
known as Vietcombank, climbed 4.9 percent to 27,900 dong, the
steepest rally since July 18. It will sell a 15 percent stake to
 Japan ’s Mizuho Financial Group Inc. for about $570 million,
Chief Executive Officer Nguyen Phuoc Thanh said yesterday.  Masan Group Corp. (MSN)  , the nation’s biggest publicly
traded company, fell 3.9 percent to 123,000 dong, a three-week
low. Vice Chairman Ho Hung Anh will cut his stake in the company
to 3.8 percent from 4.2 percent by selling 2 million shares from
Sept. 30 to Oct. 30, according to a statement on the bourse’s
website.  Saovang Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (SRC VN) dropped 2.2 percent
to 13,100 dong. Rubber declined, reversing earlier gains, as a
drop in oil reduced the appeal of the commodity amid speculation
that European leaders are divided on plans to tame a sovereign-
debt crisis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
