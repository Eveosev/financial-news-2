Germany  received fewer bids for
five-year securities than were available at an auction today, as
yields at the sale fell to the lowest on record, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Germany received bids for 5.1 billion euros ($7 billion) of
the notes maturing in October 2016, less than the maximum
available 6 billion euros of securities, according to the
results from the Bundesbank. It allocated 5 billion euros to
investors at an average yield of 1.22 percent, the lowest rate
since Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
