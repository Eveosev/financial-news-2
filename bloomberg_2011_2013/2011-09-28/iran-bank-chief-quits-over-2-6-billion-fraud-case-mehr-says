The head of  Iran ’s largest state-
owned bank lost his job over a $2.6 billion fraud case, the
biggest in the country’s history, the state-run  Mehr  news agency
reported.  The managing director of Bank Melli resigned yesterday
after coming under pressure over the embezzlement, according to
the report. Mahmoud-Reza Khavari’s resignation was accepted by
Economy and Finance Minister Shamseddin Hosseini, said Mehr,
which published an extract of Khavari’s letter in its report
late yesterday.  In the document, Khavari apologized to Iran’s Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei and to Iranians, saying he was stepping down
“to respect public opinion.” He also pointed to Bank Saderat,
another major Iranian lender, for its involvement in the
wrongdoing. Mohammad Jahromi, managing director of Bank Saderat,
may also be sacked, Mehr said, without citing anyone.  Seven state-owned and private banks were linked to the case
that involved the forging of letters of credit by an Iranian
businessman to secure loans that were then used to purchase
state-owned companies, Iranian state-run media have reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
