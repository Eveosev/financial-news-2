Cyprus deems its sovereign right to
drill for oil and gas in its offshore territory as non-
negotiable and unrelated to the reunification talks, government
spokesman  Stefanos Stefanou  said.  Cyprus rejects referring the east Mediterranean island’s
hydrocarbon exploration to the  International Court of Justice  in
the Hague as “the particular issue is not a dispute between the
Republic of Cyprus and  Turkey  but a conflict between Turkey and
international law,” Stefanou said, according to a statement e-
mailed by the Press and Information Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
