The European Unionâ€™s planned
transaction tax on financial instruments may be limited to the
secondary market so as to not interfere with initial public

the interest of maintaining capital flows while consumer loans
and transfers will also be exempted, the German newspaper
reported, citing the draft document.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
