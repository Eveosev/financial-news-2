Deregulating wheat and barley
marketing in  Canada  may boost efficiency and “provide greater
opportunities for producers and others in the grain system,”
according to recommendations from a working group made to the
Canadian Agriculture Ministry.  The group, consisting of government, university and
industry representatives, made recommendations on how the grain
industry may run if the Canadian Wheat Board becomes voluntary
for farmers, according to a  report  posted today on Agriculture
and Agri-Food Canada’s website.  Farmers in western Canada have been required to sell all
their wheat and barley for human consumption to the board since
1942. Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s  Conservative Party  has
said it plans to eliminate the monopoly by August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
