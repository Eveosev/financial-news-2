Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures fell for the first time in three days on
concern that  Europe â€™s debt crisis will linger and on rising U.S.
supplies.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 47.6 percent at 3 p.m. in New York,
up from 44.3 percent yesterday.  Oil for November delivery declined $3.24, or 3.8 percent,
to settle at $81.21 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Oil has dropped 15 percent since the end of June and
is poised for the biggest quarterly loss since 2008. Prices are
down 8.6 percent this month and 11 percent this year.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
December $50 puts, with 2,725 lots changing hands. The options
rose 7 cents to 19 cents a barrel. November $70 puts, the next-
most-active options, gained 23 cents to 62 cents a barrel on
volume of 1,803. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts outnumbered calls 56 percent to 44 percent in
electronic trading.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  November $75 puts were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 6,596 changing hands. They fell $1.12
to 90 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, November $70
puts, fell 56 cents to 39 cents a barrel on volume of 5,862.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
48,861 contracts. Next were December $50 puts with 46,539 and
December $70 puts with 45,156.  To contact the reporter on this story:
