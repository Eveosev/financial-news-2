All Nippon Airways Co.’s first
 Boeing Co. (BA)  787 landed in  Japan  today, ending more than three
years of delays for the initial operator of the aircraft.  All Nippon, which took delivery of the 787 two days ago in
Everett,  Washington , landed the plane at 9:03 a.m.  Asia ’s
largest listed carrier by sales plans the jet’s first commercial
flight next month before starting regular services in November.  The company, the biggest airline customer for the medium-
sized jet, aims to use the plane to pare fuel costs and add
destinations, such as  Frankfurt , currently only reachable with
larger jets. The Tokyo-based carrier, set to receive 12 of the
planes over the next six months, is boosting international
flights by  16 percent  in the year ending March 31.  “The plane will help ANA reduce fuel costs and should
improve its bottom line,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees
the equivalent of $650 million in assets in  Tokyo  at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. “It’s a plus for Boeing as well, as
they can finally start cranking up their production rate and
filling orders.”  ANA fell 2.5 percent to 238 yen as of 9:05 a.m. in Tokyo.
The shares have declined 21 percent this year, compared with a
16 percent drop in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  ANA has 55 of the 787 Dreamliners, whose fuselage is made
of composite materials, on order. The plane is 20 percent more
fuel-efficient to operate than comparably sized jets, due to
lighter materials and an all-electric system that doesn’t divert
air from the engines for power, according to Boeing.  The use of the composite materials and manufacturing
process pushed back the jet’s entry into service seven times
since 2007. ANA was originally due to receive the jet in 2008.  The carrier predicts the planes will save it about 10
billion yen ($131 million) a year in jet kerosene costs after
its gets all of the planes by March 2018. The carrier is
predicting net income of 20 billion yen in the year ending March
31.  Jet kerosene gained 37 percent in Singapore trading in the
past year, reaching $119.50 a barrel in the city on Sept. 27.  ANA plans to offer the first passenger flight with the 787
on Oct. 26 as a special trip between Tokyo and  Hong Kong . The
trip costs 78,700 yen for a return economy class ticket on the
plane and an overnight stay in a hotel, according to the
carrier.  Regular domestic service will start between Haneda and
Okayama and Hiroshima on Nov. 1, and intercontinental service
between Haneda and Frankfurt in January.  ANA’s first 787 has 264 seats, with 252 in economy class
and 12 in business class, while long-haul flights will have 158
seats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
