Medicare, the federal health
program for the elderly and disabled, will pay primary-care
doctors $20 on average for each patient monthly to extend office
visits and promote preventative care under a plan announced
today.  The plan is similar to programs already offered by
Indianapolis-based  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  and the North American
division of  Cie Generale des Etablissements Michelin. (ML)  Medicare
officials announced the plan in a conference call with
reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
