The  Federal Reserve ’s effort to
reduce borrowing costs is unlikely to help the housing market
enough to bolster the economy, according to  Andrew Milligan ,
Standard Life Investments Ltd.’s head of global strategy.  “Mortgage refinancing remains little different” from last
year even though the Fed’s plan to buy longer-term debt and sell
shorter-term securities sent rates on home loans to record lows,
Milligan wrote two days ago in a report.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the Mortgage Bankers
Association Refinancing Index with the average rate on 30-year
refinancings, as compiled by Bankrate.com. The index’s reading
for the week ended Sept. 16 was about the same as last November,
while the 30-year rate dropped to 4.10 percent this month, the
lowest in eight years of data and down from last year’s 4.75
percent average.  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  are doing too little to aid
refinancings, according to Edinburgh-based Milligan. The
mortgage-finance firms have operated under U.S. conservatorship
for the past three years after loan defaults pushed them close
to collapse. The lack of support is among “structural
impediments to the housing market” that will limit the
effectiveness of the Fed’s so-called Operation Twist, he wrote.  Policy makers at the central bank decided last week to buy
$400 billion of bonds maturing in six years or longer and sell
the same amount of securities due in three years or less. The
Operation Twist name was first used for a similar policy move
half a century ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
