A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
credit risk snapped three days of declines after German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  signaled that  Greece ’s bailout may need
to be renegotiated.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.2 basis point to a mid
price of 138.4 basis points as of 12:56 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The swaps index, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, dropped 8.9
basis points in the prior three trading days as investor
optimism grew that  Europe ’s leaders were making progress in
stemming the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
