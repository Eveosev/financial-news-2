Russia ’s sugar output from
domestically grown beets reached 1.12 million metric tons since
harvesting and refining began in July, up 70 percent compared
with a year earlier, when the country produced 657,200 tons, the
 Sugar Producers Union  said on its website yesterday. Crops were

century.  To contact the reporter on this story:
