Ethanol production in the U.S. fell
3.4 percent to 841,000 barrels a day last week, the steepest
decline in 11 weeks, according to an Energy Department report.  Output fell to the lowest level since the week ended Sept.
24, 2010. Stockpiles swelled 1.6 percent to 17.4 million
barrels, the biggest increase since Aug. 19.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
slumped 0.9 percent to 5.1 million barrels a day. Refiners
receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended
into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 0.8 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.569 a gallon at 10:46 a.m. New York time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have gained 8.1 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
