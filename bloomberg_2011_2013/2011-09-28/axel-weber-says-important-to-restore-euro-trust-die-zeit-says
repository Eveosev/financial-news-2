Axel Weber, the former head of
 Germany ’s Bundesbank, said it’s important to restore investor
confidence in the single currency,  Die Zeit  reported.  “Investors have invested their money in the euro region
trusting in the stability of state finances,” Weber told the
Hamburg-based newspaper in an interview, according to an e-
mailed extract. “Now they doubt that  Europe  still has this
stability. Some are even asking themselves whether Europe still
stands by the currency.”  Weber called for “closer cooperation” on budget policies
in the euro area and a “clear commitment to consolidation,”
according to the newspaper. The full interview will be published
tomorrow.  He added that “the euro has a future as the currency of
all states that have introduced it, provided the political
will,” signaling that he doesn’t see  Greece  leaving the 17-
nation single currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
