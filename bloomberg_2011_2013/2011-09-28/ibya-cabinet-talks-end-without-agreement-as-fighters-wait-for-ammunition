Libya ’s new rulers ended talks with
no agreement on an interim Cabinet, as their fighters halted an
offensive on Muammar Qaddafi’s hometown of Sirte to allow
civilians to flee and for ammunition to arrive.  Senior members of the National Transitional Council ended
negotiations on a new Cabinet in the eastern city of Benghazi
yesterday without announcing an agreement.  The formation of the interim Cabinet has been repeatedly
postponed since the NTC took Tripoli, the capital, in late
August. The council has been working to stabilize the economy
and establish authority over factions that rebelled against
Qaddafi, including the council in Misrata, the main rebel
stronghold in the west during the seven-month conflict that is
leading the Sirte operation.  Qaddafi’s forces have held off council fighters, backed by
 North Atlantic Treaty Organization  air strikes, in Sirte and the
mountain town of Bani Walid for about a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
