The cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign debt fell, reversing an earlier
increase.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments dropped four basis points to 332
at 2 p.m. in London. Indexes linked to corporate debt rose.  Credit-default swaps on  France  rose 2.5 basis points to
173.5 and  Germany  was little changed at 101.5, according to CMA.
Italy was eight higher at 467 and Portugal was up 14 at 1,086,
while  Spain  rose seven basis points to 374. Belgium was
unchanged at 252 and Ireland fell 31 to 723.  It costs $6.1 million upfront and $100,000 annually to
insure $10 million of Greek debt for five years. An increase
signals worsening perceptions of  credit quality ; a decline, the
opposite.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose one basis
point to 805. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings was 2.5 higher at 193.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell one basis point to 264 and the
subordinated gauge was up five at 511, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
