The forint and Hungarian bonds
weakened after  Fitch Ratings  said the country’s offer of early
repayment of foreign-currency mortgages at below market rates
may hurt economic growth.  The Hungarian currency depreciated as much as 1.3 percent
and dropped 0.6 percent to 288.6 per euro as of 3:56 p.m. in
Budapest, extending losses this month to 6 percent.  Government
bonds  maturing in June 2022 slumped, lifting the yield 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 7.96 percent.  The law on repayments, which enters into force this week
and which makes lenders swallow exchange-rate losses, sets a
“dangerous precedent,” Fitch Ratings said today. The plan may
reduce parent banks’ willingness to fund their Hungarian units,
hurting credit and economic growth, Fitch said in a statement.  Parliament passed a law last week to allow the repayment of
foreign-currency mortgages at 180 forint per Swiss franc and 250
forint per euro, with banks absorbing the losses. The plan sets
“a worrying precedent” and is “credit negative” for
Hungarian covered bonds, Moody’s Investors Service said in a
statement yesterday.  European stocks fell, snapping the biggest three-day rally
in 16 months, after a report that some countries are demanding
private creditors take bigger writedowns on Greek bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
