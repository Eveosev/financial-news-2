Philadelphia Eagles quarterback
 Michael Vick  said he is “100 percent” sure he will play this
weekend as he continues to recover from a bruise in his non-
throwing hand that kept him from finishing last week’s game
against the  New York Giants .  Vick, 31, participated in this morning’s walkthrough and
will practice this afternoon, the team said on its website. He
told reporters that he will play Oct. 2 when the Eagles host the
 San Francisco 49ers  at Lincoln Financial Field.  “There’s a 100 percent chance that I’ll be out there this
weekend,” Vick said on the website. “I just want to be there
for my teammates and hold myself accountable for my
responsibilities and what I have to do as a quarterback.”  Vick suffered a right hand contusion, originally diagnosed
as a break, in the third quarter of the Eagles’ 29-16 loss to
the Giants last weekend. He said he is still in pain and he will
have to focus on protecting the ball. He has a league-high six
fumbles this year.  Last month the Eagles signed Vick to a six-year, $100
million contract, with about $40 million guaranteed. He left the
team’s Week 2 game against the  Atlanta Falcons  in the third
quarter after experiencing concussion symptoms. The Eagles were
beating the Falcons and the Giants when he left the games.  Vick has completed 59 percent of his passes for 605 yards,
with four touchdowns and two interceptions this season. The
Eagles (1-2) are in last place in the National Football
Conference East division.  To contact the reporters on this story:
