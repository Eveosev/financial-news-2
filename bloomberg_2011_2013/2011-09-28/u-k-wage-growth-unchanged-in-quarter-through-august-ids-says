U.K. wage growth was unchanged in
the three months through August as public-sector pay remained
frozen amid the government’s budget squeeze, according to
Incomes Data Services.  The median pay settlement held at 2.5 percent, matching
wage growth in the previous three months, the London-based pay
researcher said in an e-mailed statement today. The data cover
60 deals for 565,524 workers. Employers plan to “slightly”
increase the average pay rise in 2012 from 2.5 percent in 2011,
IDS said, citing a survey of human resource professionals.  “If the recession recedes, there may be pressure for
higher awards, particularly at firms where increases were lower
or zero before,” Ken Mulkearn, editor of the IDS Pay Report,
said in the statement. “But the uncertain economic outlook, and
the impact of public-sector cuts on both the wider economy and
the labor market, will make for a tougher climate when it comes
to decision-making on pay.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
