Slovak ruling coalition is near an
agreement on unblocking the overhaul of  Europe ’s bailout
mechanism, lawmaker for Freedom and Solidarity party told TV

said Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova ’s latest proposal meets the
party’s conditions. The party, known also under an acronym SaS,
has previously said it won’t vote for any measures to strengthen
the European Financial Stability Facility, the region’s
temporary bailout fund.       To contact the editor responsible for this story:
