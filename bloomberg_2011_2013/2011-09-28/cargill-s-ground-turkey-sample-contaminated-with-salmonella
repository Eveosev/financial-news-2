A ground turkey sample that led to
Cargill Inc.’s 185,000-pound recall earlier this month was
confirmed to be contaminated by the salmonella Heidelberg
outbreak strain, the Agriculture Department said.  The strain is resistant to ampicillin, gentamicin,
streptomycin, and tetracycline, the department’s  Food Safety and
Inspection Service   said  on its website.   Last month, Cargill recalled 35.7 million pounds of ground
turkey from the same plant in  Arkansas .   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
