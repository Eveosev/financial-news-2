French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
government presented a 2012 budget that keeps spending unchanged
from this year, with higher debt and pension charges continuing
to weigh on its deficit.  The deficit in 2012 will be 81.8 billion euros ($111.3
billion), or 4.5 percent of economic output, down from 95.5
billion, or 5.7 percent, this year. The deficit was 7.1 percent
in 2010. Spending in the government’s general budget and
payments to local governments will amount to 275.6 billion euros
in 2012, unchanged from 2011.  “The 2012 budget is built to cut spending, it’s a key,
essential step on our way to cut debt,” Budget Minister Valerie Pecresse told reporters in Paris. “For the first time since the
war, a government has managed to hold the line on spending.”  Sarkozy, like President  Barack Obama , must balance his re-
election bid against the need to fix his nation’s finances.
 France , the second-biggest contributor to the euro region’s
bailout funds, now pays a premium of 73 basis points over
 Germany  to borrow for 10 years, up from 27 basis points when the
rescue system was set up in May 2010.  Both Germany and France are AAA-rated countries. France’s
financial institutions’ holdings of debt in troubled euro-region
countries and its slowing economic growth sparked speculation
its top  credit rating  may be at risk.  “We are being scrutinized, we must keep our commitments,”
Pecresse said.  Debt Servicing  The cost of servicing France’s debt will rise to 48.8
billion euros in 2012 from 45.4 billion euros, and pension
spending will increase to 37.9 billion euros from 36.0 billion
euros, the budget shows. The debt will start to decline from
2013, Pecresse said.  “Debt will fall when the deficit drops below 3 percent of
gross domestic product,” Pecresse said. “The turning point
will be in 2013, that’s when debt will start to decrease.”  At 1.6 trillion euros, France’s outstanding debt will be
about 85 percent of GDP by year-end, according to the
 International Monetary Fund . That compares with 120.6 percent
for Italy and 98.3 percent for the U.S.  The budget calls for a 3 percent tax on all incomes over
500,000 euros that will last until the deficit falls below 3
percent of GDP. Some members of Sarkozy’s party have called for
the income threshold for the tax to be lowered to 250,000 euros.  Pecresse said she expects Parliament to debate the issue.
The budget also raises taxes on sugared drinks, and a one-off
tax on companies participating in the European Union’s
emissions-trading system to help fund the purchase of additional
allowances for new plants.  Opposition Control  Outlines of the 2012 budget were announced last month when
Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  unveiled 12 billion euros in
budget-trimming measures to reassure markets the country was
committed to shrinking its deficit.  The budget will be the first of the five that Sarkozy’s
government has presented since his 2007 election that will face
a Senate controlled by the opposition. The Socialist party this
week took control of the Senate, which can delay, although not
block, legislation.  France will continue to replace only one out of every two
retiring civil servants, Pecresse said, which will reduce the
state’s payrolls by 30,400 in 2012.  The budget is based on French growth of 1.75 percent in
2012 and a consumer inflation rate of 1.7 percent. It also
presupposes a U.S. expansion of 2 percent, euro-area growth of
1.4 percent, an exchange rate of $1.43 to the euro and Brent oil
at $110 a barrel.  For 2013 to 2015, the government is forecasting 2 percent
growth a year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
