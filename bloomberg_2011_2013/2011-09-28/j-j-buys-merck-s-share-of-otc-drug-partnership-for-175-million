Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  bought Merck &
Co.’s half of the companies’ joint venture for over-the-counter
medicines for heartburn and digestive diseases for $175 million,
ending a 22-year partnership in the U.S. and  Canada .  The deal announced today includes a manufacturing plant in
Lancaster,  Pennsylvania , that is part of a consent decree with
U.S. regulators because of production violations. J&J, the
world’s second-biggest seller of health products after Pfizer
Inc., has recalled dozens of drugs and devices in the past two
years, including nonprescription medicines such as Tylenol.  Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, sold its
share of the business to focus on its consumer products division
acquired in the 2009 purchase of Schering-Plough Corp., the
company said in a statement. Merck plans to convert some of its
prescription drugs to over-the-counter use in the U.S. and
Canada, and will pursue licensing deals for others, the company
said.  J&J, based in New Brunswick,  New Jersey , will rename the
former joint venture as McNeil Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co. and
continue to sell the Pepcid, Mylanta and Mylicon brands, the
company said in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
