France ’s central government budget
deficit may fall to 81.8 billion euros ($111 billion) in 2012
from an expected shortfall of 95.5 billion euros in 2011,  Les
Echos  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The total government deficit will fall to 4.5 percent of
gross domestic product in 2012 from 5.7 percent in 2011, the
newspaper said. France’s debt will reach to 87.4 percent of GDP
2012 and 87.3 percent in 2013, and the total tax burden will
jump to 44.5 percent of GDP next year, the newspaper said.  France will create a carbon tax next year on large
industrial companies, ranging from utilities to steelmakers,
carmakers and chemical makers,  Les Echos  also said. The tax,
representing between 0.08 percent and 0.12 percent of revenue,
will raise about 250 million euros, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
