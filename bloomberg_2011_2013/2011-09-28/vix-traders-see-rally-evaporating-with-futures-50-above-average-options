The biggest three-day rally in a
month for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is failing to convince
U.S. options traders to lower their guard against more losses.  Futures on the VIX show investors expect the Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index to remain at least 50 percent
above its historical average of 20.45 through May, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The VIX slid 3.4 percent to 37.71 yesterday,
while May futures fell 1.1 percent to 32.15. The  S&P 500  climbed
4.1 percent between Sept. 22 and yesterday.  The cost of options to protect against equity-market
declines remains elevated even as shares reflect optimism that
European leaders will tame the region’s debt crisis. Insurance
against 10 percent losses in the S&P 500 has surged to the
highest levels since May 2010, and the pricing difference
between U.S. and European options has narrowed.  “Even though there’s some good news coming out of  Europe ,
the problems of the world economic system have not been
solved,” Joshua Parker, who oversees almost $400 million in
options and stocks at Gargoyle Asset Management LLC in
Englewood,  New Jersey , said in a telephone interview yesterday.
“Until the world economic system is stabilized, and that’s not
going to take place overnight, we’re going to see volatility.”  The S&P 500 has rallied as U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  and other foreign leaders apply pressure on Europe
to address the debt crisis that’s driven  Greece  toward default.
While the VIX has fallen, it remains above 37, a closing level
reached during only seven periods since 1997.  Greek Vote  Equities advanced worldwide yesterday after Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  won a vote in parliament on a new
property tax, bolstering his chances of pushing through
austerity cuts aimed at securing further international financial
aid for the country.  The VIX advanced 8.9 percent to 41.08 today as the S&P 500
reversed earlier gains to drop 2.1 percent, the most in a week.  Implied volatility for S&P 500 contracts betting on 10
percent losses has risen 11.74 points higher than calls wagering
on 10 percent gains, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with the 15-month high of 12.33 points set on Aug.
24 for the pricing difference known as skew. Swings in the stock
market have widened, which may drive options prices higher. S&P
500 realized volatility for the past 60 days is 34.65, its
highest level since June 2009.  Bear Market   The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares in 45 nations
extended its slump since May 2 to more than 20 percent last
week, meeting the definition of a bear market, after credit-
default swaps showed investors see an almost 100 percent chance
Greece will be unable to repay its debt within five years.
Benchmark measures for 32 out of 45 nations in the index also
reached that threshold as of Sept. 23, and 18 of the 20 markets
with the biggest losses from their peaks were European, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “You have all of Europe looking to implode, a significant
chance of a double-dip recession and any number of things
spooking the market right now,” Dominic Salvino, a Chicago-
based specialist at Group One Trading, the primary market maker
for VIX options, said in a telephone interview yesterday.
“These are long-term problems that will have to play out over
months, if not years.”  Yesterday’s rally was spurred in part by cheaper valuations
luring investors back to stocks, according to Wayne Wilbanks,
chief investment officer at Wilbanks, Smith & Thomas in Norfolk,
 Virginia , which manages about $1.8 billion.  “The lack of negative news is enough” to prompt a rebound
in stocks, he said yesterday in a phone interview. “The bears
can get as bearish as they want to, but eventually they’ve got
to say stocks are too cheap.”  Price to Book  S&P 500 shares traded yesterday for 1.92 times book value,
or assets minus liabilities, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The valuation sank to 1.83 on Aug. 8, the lowest
since the month the  bull market  began in 2009. Before Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and
intensified the financial crisis, the valuation hadn’t fallen
below 2 since at least 1995, the data show.  Since the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities retreated to
less than 1,250 on Aug. 4, it has traded between 1,119.46 and
1,218.89 on a closing basis. The measure rose 1.1 percent
yesterday to 1,175.38.  “Everyone thinks we’re in a range between 1,100 and
1,225,” Jonathan Bensimon, head of equities and derivatives
trading for the Americas at Societe Generale SA in  New York ,
said in a telephone interview yesterday. The 1,200 level is
“when people start to want to get short or at least buy puts,
so that pushes volatility up.”  Trimming Gains  The S&P 500 advanced as much as 2.8 percent yesterday
before paring its gain in the last hour of trading, following a
Financial Times report that some euro-area countries are
demanding private creditors take bigger writedowns on their
Greek bond holdings.  “Politicians keep kicking the sovereign debt can down the
road,” Nelson Saiers, chief investment officer of Alphabet
Management LLC, said in an e-mail yesterday. The New York-based
volatility hedge fund manages about $635 million. “The bid in
back-month VIX futures just reflects that.”  Six-month VIX futures exceeded 33 on Sept. 22, a level seen
during two periods since the contracts began trading seven years
ago: between October 2008 and May 2009, and the middle of 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protection
against losses in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, rose 1.9 percent to
46.39 today. The VIX last week eliminated more than half its
discount to the VStoxx as traders bet Europe’s debt crisis will
engulf the U.S.  Six-Month Contracts  Implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, is
rising faster for longer-term S&P 500 contracts than it is for
those expiring sooner as investors pay more to protect stocks
into 2012 and 2013. The level for six-month S&P 500 contracts
has risen 10 percent from a month ago to 29.97, while one- and
two-year options both increased at least 8.3 percent, Bloomberg
data show. That compares with a 5.3 percent gain for 30-day
options over the same period.  “Investors don’t buy this rally,” said Steve Kilcullen,
head of flow derivatives sales for the Americas at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in New York. “If they did believe it, they would
be selling short-dated volatility much more aggressively because
they’ve already gotten burned once.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
