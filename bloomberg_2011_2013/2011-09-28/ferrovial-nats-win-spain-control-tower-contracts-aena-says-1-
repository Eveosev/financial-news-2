Spain â€™s state-controlled airports
operator Aena Aeropuertos SA said it awarded  Ferrovial SA (FER) , NATS
Holdings Ltd. and Saerco five-year contracts to manage control
towers in 13 airports to cut its costs by close to 50 percent.  Outsourcing control-tower management will enable Aena to
reduce its annual costs to 18.1 million euros ($22 million) from
33.9 million euros for the 13 airports, said a spokeswoman who
declined to be named in line with company policy.  Ferrovial and NATS will run 10 towers and Saerco will
manage three, the airport operator said today in an e-mailed
statement from Madrid. The contracts can be extended by a year.  Ferrovial SA and NATS will manage towers in Alicante,
Valencia, Ibiza, Sabadell, Seville, Jerez, Vigo, La Coruna,
Melilla and Cuatro Vientos while Saerco will manage them in
Lanzarote, Fuerteventura and La Palma, according to the
statement. Air controllers working for Aena in those towers will
have the choice between remaining with Aena and relocating or
accepting a new employer with different working conditions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
