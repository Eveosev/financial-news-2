Heliopolis Housing (HELI)  tumbled to the
lowest in more than two years after  Al Mal  reported the Cairo-
based real-estate developer plans to auction plots of land next
week as it seeks to boost liquidity.  The shares dropped 4 percent to 13.04 Egyptian pounds, the
lowest since March 2009, at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo.  The company wants to have liquidity that will help it
continue its housing projects, the Cairo-based newspaper said.
The plots of land will have areas ranging from 700 square meters
(7,535 square feet) to 800 square meters, Al Mal reported,
citing Chairman Fadel Al Shahawy.  Calls to the headquarters of Heliopolis Housing werenâ€™t
answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
