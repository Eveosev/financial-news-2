The Obama administration views
 China ’s currency as “substantially undervalued” and is
reviewing legislation that aims to penalize the world’s second-
largest economy, White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said.  “We share the goal” of pushing China to let its currency
appreciate, Carney said, without saying whether the
administration would support the measure, which has bipartisan
sponsorship in the Senate. While China “has moved some” in
allowing its currency to rise, it remains “substantially
undervalued,” he said.  The legislation would let U.S. companies seek duties on
imports from China to compensate for the effect of a weak yuan,
which lawmakers said gives Chinese companies an unfair advantage
against U.S. manufacturers.  China’s yuan rose after the central bank set a record daily
reference rate, fueling speculation policy makers will favor
currency gains as a means to tame inflation and support global
exports. The currency gained 0.08 percent to 6.3938 per dollar
in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System.  Republican Senator  Orrin Hatch  of Utah has asked the
administration to clarify its stance on the legality of the
legislation before the Senate debates it next week.  China’s currency policies have cost more than 2.8 million
U.S. jobs since 2001, Democratic Senators  Charles Schumer  of New
York and  Sherrod Brown  of Ohio said at a news conference last
week.  Schumer proposed similar measures in each of the past six
years. None has received a Senate vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
