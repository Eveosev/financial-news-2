Coloplast A/S plans to stay in the
wound-care business and wants to expand, Chief Financial Officer
Lene Skole said today the Jefferies health-care conference in
 London .  “We are investing heavily in the growth of that
business,” she said. “We need to get more scale in that
business one way or another.  ‘‘We do think consolidation is coming and we would like to
take part in that consolidation.’’  Chief Executive Officer Lars Rasmussen said in March the
company would sell the wound-care business if a restructuring
didn’t lead to higher sales and profit by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
