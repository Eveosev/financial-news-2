Canadian natural gas fell as
drilling in the U.S., the biggest consumer of the nation’s gas
output, increased supplies of the fuel.  There were 912 rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. last week,
46 more than this year’s low of 866 in the week ended May 20,
according to data compiled by Baker Hughes Inc. New York gas
futures have dropped 11 percent since then.  “The bearish rig counts have been keeping the market
down,” said Carl Neill, an energy consultant with Risk
Management Inc. in Atlanta.  Alberta  gas for October delivery fell 5.5 cents to C$3.44
per gigajoule ($3.17 per million Btu) as of 2:50 p.m. New York
time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet market. November gas
was down 4.25 cents to C$3.50 per gigajoule. Gas traded on the
exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the U.S. and is
priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 6.8 cents, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $3.759 per
million Btu. The October contract expired at the end of floor
trading today. November gas was down 7.6 cents to $3.799 per
million Btu.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
fell 8.09 cents, or 2 percent, to $3.9046 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  Regional Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas was down 0.97 cent to $3.8008, according to ICE.
At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas fell 2.98 cents to $3.847 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.7 billion cubic
feet, 96 million below the target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.73 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.96 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 374 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.5 billion cubic feet today, about 80 percent of its
capacity of 1.88 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.83
billion cubic feet at 1:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
