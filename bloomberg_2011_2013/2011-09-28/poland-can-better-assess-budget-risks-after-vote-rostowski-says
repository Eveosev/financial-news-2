Poland’s government will be in a
better position to assess the risks to economic growth posed by
global turmoil after the Oct. 9 general election, when a new
cabinet may amend the draft budget, Finance Minister Jacek
Rostowski told reporters today in Warsaw.  Polish law stipulates that any draft law that not passed by
parliament expires when lawmakers’ four-year term ends,
Rostowski said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
