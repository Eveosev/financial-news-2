Computer forecast models are split
over how warm the U.S. East Coast will get next week, said  Matt Rogers , president of  Commodity Weather Group  LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland .  Rogers said he favors a model showing the U.S. Northeast
and Mid-Atlantic coasts to be about 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.6
Celsius) cooler than average in his 6-to-10-day outlook. The
Great Plains to northern  Texas  may warm, while the West Coast
will probably be cooler.  “There is debate as to how much warming reaches the East
Coast,” Rogers wrote in a note to clients. “We leaned toward
the cooler East Coast solution today with slow warming arriving
there by the 11 - 15 day.”  In his 11-to-15-day forecast, Rogers predicts the eastern
half of the U.S. will be warmer than normal, accept for the
extreme U.S. Southeast, which will be seasonal from Oct. 8 to
Oct. 12. At the same time the U.S. West and  Rocky Mountains  will
cool 3 to 5 degrees below normal.  The U.S.  Climate Prediction Center’s  6-to-10-day forecast
for Oct. 3 to Oct. 7 calls for a 40 percent chance the U.S.
Southeast will be cooler than normal. The Great Plains have a 50
to 70 percent chance of being warmer.  In the 8-to-14 day outlook, the climate center says there
is a 50 percent chance the U.S. Great Lakes will be warmer than
normal. Much of the U.S. Northeast has a 40 percent chance to
warm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
