Dutch authorities arrested four men
suspected of selling more than $200 million in investments in
U.S. life insurance policies in an alleged  Ponzi scheme .  Quality Investments BV  is suspected of having sold
investment products to hundreds of investors, mainly in the
Netherlands and  Belgium , the Dutch Fiscal Information and
Investigation Service said in a statement today.  Provident Capital Indemnity Ltd., the Costa Rica-based firm
accused by U.S. prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange
Commission in January of conducting life settlement bonding
fraud, would provide the securities, the Dutch authorities said.  No one at Quality Investments was available to comment on
the allegations, according to a telephone operator at its
Amsterdam offices, who declined to be identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
