Colombian coffee production will
rise to 10 million bags in the season starting next month after
rains cut output in the past three seasons, according to the
country’s Coffee Growers’ Federation.  The crop in the 2010-11 season is expected to be 8.6
million to 8.7 million bags, said Luis Munoz, chief executive
officer of the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation. Each bag
contains 60 kilograms (132 pounds) of beans. Production in the
three previous seasons was smaller than the 12.5 million bags in
2007-08, data from the  International Coffee Organization  showed.  “If weather is normal, without El Nino or La Nina,
 Colombia ’s production will easily reach 10 million bags,” Munoz
said in an interview at the ICO offices in London today.  El Nino is a weather pattern of warm ocean temperatures in
the Equatorial Pacific and La Nina is chracterized by cold
temperatures in the area.  The coffee crop in the Andean nation will have fully
recovered from the shortfalls by the 2012-13 season, Munoz said.
Colombia plans to increase output to 14 million bags by 2015
through a replanting program to increase the yield, he said.  “We have replanted 80,000 hectares (197,684 acres) so far
this year, 30,000 more than in the same period last year,” he
said. “We have projected to reach 120,000 hectares by the end
of this year,” he said, adding that the program would continue
over the next four years.  Investments are also being made in training farmers,
increasing the use of fertilizers and planting trees that are
more resistant to  climate change , he said.  $2 a Pound  Coffee prices are likely to remain above $2 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. as supplies remain tight, Munoz said, adding that
supplies will be limited during the next five or six years as
consumption rises.  “What we see in the fundamentals lead us to conclude that
the market in  New York  has a new floor of $2 a pound,” he said.
“While the market is still tight, there will be volatility.”  Consumption in Colombia grew about 1 percent in 2010 after
20 years of stability or even slowing usage, he said. The
country plans to increase domestic demand by 30 percent in the
next five years, he said.  Colombia is also focusing on sustainability, and 110,000
growers have some kind of certification label, Munoz said.
That’s about 25 percent of the country’s growers and compares
with only 4,000 certified producers five years ago, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
