British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) ,
the U.K.’s biggest pay-TV operator, may lease about 45,000
square feet (4,200 square meters) of space in Dublin, two people
familiar with the matter said.  BSkyB is looking at properties including Burlington Plaza,
an office block near the central business district, according to
the people, who declined to be identified because the
information isn’t public. Spokesman Robert Fraser declined to
comment.  The company, based near London, has opened offices in
Stockport and Sheffield, in northern England, in the last year
to handle queries from customers. In June it announced a plan to
open another in Newcastle in October.  BSkyB sales rose about 16 percent to 6.6 billion pounds
($10 billion) in the year ended June 30. The company had 541,000
cable subscribers in Ireland in June 2008, the last date for
which figures are available.  News Corp. (NWSA)  owns 39.1 percent of BSkyB. Bloomberg LP, the
parent of Bloomberg News, competes with News Corp. units in
providing financial news and information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
