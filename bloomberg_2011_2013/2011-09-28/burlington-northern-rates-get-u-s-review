Burlington Northern  Santa Fe ,
purchased by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  last year,
is facing scrutiny by the U.S. government after complaints that
the railroad tried to pass on $7.6 billion in acquisition costs
to shippers.  The  Surface Transportation Board  said today it will examine
regulatory effects of the price Berkshire paid for Burlington
Northern, including the railroad’s rates. Coal shippers said
earlier this year that  Fort Worth , Texas-based Burlington
Northern is seeking to use government accounting methods to
recoup some of Berkshire’s costs from railroad customers.  “We’re looking at what effects the purchase of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe by Berkshire” could have on regulations and
shipper rates, said Eric Weiss, a spokesman for the government
agency.  Entergy Corp. and 15 other electric utilities said the
company would be able to raise rates and make challenges more
difficult if its regulator allows some of the acquisition cost
over book value to be part of Burlington’s rate-cost base.  Executives of six other utilities and their coal supplier
wrote to Buffett on May 12, saying Burlington’s effort “is not
consistent with Berkshire’s values and its historic reputation
for making fair and moral business decisions.” The six
utilities estimate their rates would increase $34 million over
13 years.  A Burlington Northern spokeswoman couldn’t immediately
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
