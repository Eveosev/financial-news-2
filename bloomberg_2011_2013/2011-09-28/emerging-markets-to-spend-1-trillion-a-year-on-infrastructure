Developing nations will need to
spend $1 trillion a year on infrastructure such as roads and
power and telecommunications networks over the next 20 years to
spur economic growth, a study released today predicted.  Asia  will require most, about $15.8 trillion over the 20-
year period, according to a joint study by Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Cambridge University of 40 major
emerging-market economies.  “Emerging Europe” will need $1.3 trillion, while  Latin
America  will require $1.2 trillion. Of the so-called BRIC
nations, China will need to invest $10.5 trillion, followed by
India at $3.8 trillion, Russia at $462 billion and Brazil at
$527 billion, the research forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
