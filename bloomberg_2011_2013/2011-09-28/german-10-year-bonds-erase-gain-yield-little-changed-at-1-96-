German two-year notes declined for
a third day, while bunds pared their advance.  The two-year note yield increased two basis points to 0.56
percent as of 8:44 a.m. in  London . The 10-year bund yield
slipped less than one basis point to 1.95 percent, after falling
to 1.92 percent.  Inflation in the German state of Saxony increased 2.6
percent in September from a year ago after rising an annual 2.4
percent in August, the state’s statistics office in Kamenz said
today. Economists forecast that German inflation, calculated
using a harmonized European Union method, will quicken to 2.6
percent from 2.5 percent, the median of 20 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey shows. The Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden will release that report, based on data from six
states, later today.  German bonds and the securities of other so-called core
euro-area nations rose this month as data signaled the region’s
economy is at risk of slipping back into a recession and the
sovereign-debt crisis worsened. Bunds have returned 2 percent
this month, with French debt returning 1.4 percent, according to
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Greek securities lost 23
percent, while  Italy  declined 2.7 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
