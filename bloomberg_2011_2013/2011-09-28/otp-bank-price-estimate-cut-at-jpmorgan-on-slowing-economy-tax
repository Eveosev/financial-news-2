OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, had its share price estimate cut by 35 percent at
JPMorgan Cazenove because of slowing economic growth in Hungary,
the costs of foreign-currency loans and a tax on banks.  JPMorgan cut the price estimate for the end of 2012 to
4,400 forint from 6,800 forint, keeping its recommendation at
“overweight,” according to a research report by analysts
including Paul Formanko in  London .  The shares rose 1.1 percent to 3,295 forint at 9:32 a.m. in
Budapest, a third day of gains and paring its loss this month to
21 percent.  “The battle to revive domestic profit growth is likely to
continue,” the JPMorgan analysts wrote. “For longer-term value
investors over 12 months we believe current share price weakness
offers an attractive entry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
