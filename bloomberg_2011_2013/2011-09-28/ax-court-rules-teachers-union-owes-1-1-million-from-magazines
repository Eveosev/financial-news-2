A portion of National Education
Association members’ dues count as circulation income for the
union’s magazine, creating a $1.1 million tax bill for the
group, the U.S. Tax Court  ruled .  The court said in the ruling today that because NEA members
had a “right to receive” the magazine, a share of member dues
counted as circulation income.  That dues income wiped out a loss from circulation activity
that was unavailable to offset taxable revenue from advertising
in the magazine, NEA Today, according to the ruling.  As a result, the NEA owed tax of $319,094 for 2001,
$444,554 for 2002 and $342,371 for 2003, according to Internal
Revenue Service findings in June 2009 that led the teachers
union to take its case to the tax court.  NEA maintained that its members didn’t have the right to
receive the publication because the union was under no
obligation to continue publishing it and because the magazine
was available for free on the Internet.  The  IRS  said NEA members had right to receive the magazine
because their dues paid for it.  NEA , based in  Washington , has 3.2 million members. The
union did not immediately respond to a request for comment
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
