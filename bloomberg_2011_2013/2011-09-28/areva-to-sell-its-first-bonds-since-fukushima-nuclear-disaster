Areva SA, the world’s largest
builder of nuclear plants, sold its first bonds since the
Fukushima disaster in  Japan  made some nations rethink their
reliance on atomic energy.  The utility issued 500 million euros ($680 million) of six-
year 4.625 percent notes, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company last sold bonds in September 2010 when it
issued 750 million euros of 3.5 percent notes due in 2021, the
data show.  Areva’s BBB+ rating outlook was cut to negative in August
by  Standard & Poor’s , which cited “increased uncertainties
surrounding the nuclear industry.” The company lowered its
outlook for nuclear plant orders through 2030 in the wake of
Japan’s nuclear disaster in March, Chief Executive Officer Luc
Oursel told Les Echos newspaper earlier this month.  Areva’s new notes were priced to yield 255 basis points
more than the benchmark swap rate, or 4.7 percent, Bloomberg
data show. That compares with 3.6 percent for Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s EUR Corporates Utilities index, which tracks 200
securities issued by companies including Electricite de France
SA and Enel SpA.  The yield on Areva’s 2021 notes rose 30 basis points to
5.23 percent today, the highest since April, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield touched a post-Fukushima
low of 4.48 percent in August.  BNP Paribas SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Banco Santander SA
and Societe Generale SA managed the sale of the new bonds, two
people with knowledge of the transaction said today.  Areva shares have fallen 38 percent this year. The company
is 83 percent-owned by the French government, Bloomberg data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
