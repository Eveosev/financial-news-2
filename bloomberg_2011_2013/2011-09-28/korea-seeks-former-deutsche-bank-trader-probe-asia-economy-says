(Corrects to reflect removal of name of investment bank in
Asia Economy Daily’s report.)  South Korea ’s financial regulator
asked prosecutors to investigate a foreign bank’s former
employee for manipulating prices of a derivative-linked stock,
Asia Economy Daily reported.  The former employee made a profit of 4.5 billion won ($3.9
million) from illicit activities, according to the Korean-
language report, citing a Securities and Futures Commission
decision.  The Securities and Futures Commission requested prosecutors
probe a former trader at a foreign bank’s  Hong Kong  branch for
price manipulation on equity-linked securities derivatives,
according to an e-mailed statement from the Financial
Supervisory Service that didn’t identify the former employee or
bank.  Kim Soo Mi, an FSS spokeswoman, declined to elaborate,
citing the regulator’s policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
