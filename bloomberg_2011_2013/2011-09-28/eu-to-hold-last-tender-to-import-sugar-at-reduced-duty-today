The European Union will hold the
last of five planned tenders today to import sugar at a reduced
duty rate to ease shortages in the bloc, according to the
European Commission, the EU’s executive arm.  The deadline for offers is noon Brussels time, European
Commission spokesman  Roger Waite  said. The results of the tender
will be confirmed at tomorrow’s management committee meeting and
published in the EU’s Official Journal on Sept. 30, he said.  The bloc has already imported 280,495 metric tons of raw-
sugar for refining, 3,761 tons of raw sugar not for refining,
52,697 tons of white, or refined, sugar and 20 tons of other
sugars at reduced duty under the last four tenders, according to
the commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
