Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , the Scottish  oil
company  exploring in Greenland, dropped in London trading after
abandoning its third well in less than two months.  The shares fell 6.5 percent after Edinburgh-based Cairn
said today in a statement it will abandon the Delta-1
exploration well 365 kilometers (227 miles) off Aasiaat in the
Napariaq Block after failing to find “hydrocarbon shows.”  Cairn had planned to drill as many as four wells off the
island at a cost of $600 million this year, it said in May. So
far, it has not found any commercially viable oil resources in
its two-year exploration campaign off the island, the world’s
largest.  Earlier this month, Cairn abandoned the nearby Gamma-1 well
after previously plugging the LF7-1 exploration well, about 300
kilometers off Nuuk, Greenland’s capital.  The stock retreated 19.1 pence to 276.5 pence as of the
4:30 p.m. close in  London . The shares have fallen 24 percent
since August.  Other companies that have been awarded Greenland
exploration licenses in the last decade include Exxon Mobil
Corp., Chevron Corp. and Encana Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
