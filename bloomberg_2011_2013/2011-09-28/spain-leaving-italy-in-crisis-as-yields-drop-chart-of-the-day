The  bond market  is favoring Spain
over Italy by the most in more than two and a half years as
investors bet the Iberian nation’s lower debt level means it is
more likely to avoid a bailout than its euro-region peer.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the extra yield investors
receive for holding Italian 10-year bonds instead of similar-
maturity Spanish securities widened to 56 basis points
yesterday, the most since January 2009. That compares with an
average 49 basis points premium for Spanish bonds in the first
six months of the year. Italy’s government predicts its debt
will be 121 percent of its gross domestic product this year,
while Spain’s government says its will be 67.3 percent.  “Everyone knows that  Spain  has problems and that was the
focus six-to-12 months ago,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-
income strategist at WestLB AG in London. “Now they seem
manageable. The focus has shifted to a medium-term assessment of
the sustainability of the debt and Italy has a much larger debt-
to-GDP ratio than Spain, so any rise in funding costs hurts them
more.”  The  European Central Bank  began buying bonds from both
countries on Aug. 8, according to people familiar with the
transactions, after debt-crisis contagion sent borrowing costs
up to euro-era records. While the purchases brought both
nations’ 10-year bond yields down to about 5 percent in the week
ending Aug. 12, Italy’s have since advanced, reaching 5.64
percent yesterday. Spain’s were about 5.08 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
