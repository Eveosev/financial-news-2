BP Plc (BP/)  plans to shut the East Azeri
platform in Azerbaijan’s sector of the  Caspian Sea  for planned
maintenance next month, Tamam Bayatli, a spokeswoman in the
country for the oil producer, said by phone today.  BP will close two other platforms, West Azeri and Central
Azeri, for planned maintenance in mid-November and early
December respectively, Bayatli said in the Azeri capital of
Baku. The work on each platform will take about 10 to 12 days
with intervals.  “This is part of normal operations,” Bayatli said. Oil
exports will continue in all directions, by the Baku-Tbilisi-
Ceyhan and Baku-Supsa pipelines and by rail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
