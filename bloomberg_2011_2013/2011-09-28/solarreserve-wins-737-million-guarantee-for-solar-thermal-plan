SolarReserve LLC, a closely held
renewable energy developer, received a $737 million U.S. Energy
Department loan guarantee to build a solar-thermal project in
 Nevada .  The 110-megawatt Crescent Dunes project, near Tonopah,
Nevada, will use the sun’s heat to create steam that drives a
turbine, the agency said today in a e-mailed statement.
SolarReserve is based in  Santa Monica , California.  Lawmakers in Washington are scrutinizing the Energy
Department’s program in the wake of Solyndra LLC’s Sept. 6
bankruptcy filing. The Fremont, California-based solar-panel
maker received a $527 million loan guarantee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
