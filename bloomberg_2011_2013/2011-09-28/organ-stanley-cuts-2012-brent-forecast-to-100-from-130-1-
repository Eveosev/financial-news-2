Morgan Stanley (MS)  said Brent oil will
average $100 next year, down from a previous projection of $130,
because of increasing supply and a weaker demand outlook.  Production capacity in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will climb almost 800,000 barrels a day in
2012, led by the return of Libyan fields, Morgan Stanley
analysts led by New York-based Hussein Allidina said in a report
today. Non-OPEC output will rise 225,000 barrels.  Slowing global economic growth will result in reducing
demand growth, the analysts said. Consumption will advance
600,000 barrels a day in 2012, down from a 950,000 gain this
year and 2.7 million barrel advance in 2010.  Brent oil for November settlement fell $3.33, or 3.1
percent, to end the session at $103.81 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
