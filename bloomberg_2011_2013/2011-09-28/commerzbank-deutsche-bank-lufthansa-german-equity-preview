May 2 amid concern global economic growth is slowing and policy
makers are struggling to contain the European debt crisis. The
broader HDAX Index advanced 1 percent today.  “ Europe  is showing glimmers of hope for political
certainty,” said Daniel Weston, a portfolio adviser at

211 billion euros ($287 billion) from 123 billion euros.  German Banks  Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest bank, climbed 3.9 percent

citing a letter from  Angela Merkel ’s Chief of Staff Ronald
Pofalla to the association for the German air industry.  Balda plummeted 5.6 percent to 5.52 euros, the lowest since

million euros as reported by the Handelsblatt.  Vossloh AG (VOS)  slumped 9.8 percent to 76.62 euros, the biggest
