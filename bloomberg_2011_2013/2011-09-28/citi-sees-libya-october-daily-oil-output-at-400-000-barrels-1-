Libyan crude production may reach
400,000 barrels a day next month as fields and ports resume
operations after armed conflict blocked output and exports for
much of the year, Citigroup Inc. analysts said.  The country’s transitional government is seeking to speed
up production, and the good condition of its wells and
transportation links may help, analysts including  Edward Morse ,
the bank’s global commodities research head, said today.  Overall production will recover next year to about 1
million barrels of crude a day, or 75 percent of the amount
 Libya  exported before hostilities broke out in February against
the government of  Muammar Qaddafi , according to a presentation
prepared for a Citigroup Global Markets conference call.  Libya’s National Transitional Council is working to
establish its authority in the capital Tripoli following a
seven-month rebellion. The hostilities cut global oil production
by 1.5 percent, though Libya accounted for 10 percent of the
world’s output of “high-quality” light sweet crude, Morse
said.  Light, sweet crude is easier for refiners to process than
heavier, more viscous oils that may contain more impurities.
Light crudes generally command a higher price than heavier oils.  To contact the reporters on this story:
