Britons’ inflation expectations for
the coming year were unchanged at 3.5 percent in September
compared with the previous month, Citigroup Inc. said today in
an e-mailed report, citing a  YouGov Plc (YOU)  survey.  Consumers’ longer-term inflation expectations for the next
five to ten years increased to 3.8 percent from 3.7 percent in
August, Citigroup said.  “Trends in inflation expectations are not in our view
alarming enough to prevent” the Bank of England’s Monetary
Policy Committee from extending their so-called quantitative
easing program “in response to the clear signs of sharp
economic slowdown,” Citigroup economist  Michael Saunders  said
in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
