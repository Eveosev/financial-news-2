OAO Cherkizovo Group,  Russia ’s
biggest poultry producer, headed for its strongest gain in more
than a year after saying it will buy back as much as 2 percent
of its stock.  The shares rose 6.6 percent, heading for the biggest
increase since June 2010, to trade at 720 rubles at 5:52 p.m. in
Moscow. Global depositary receipts will also be included in the
buyback offer, Cherkizovo said today in a statement.  Cherkizovo intends to buy stock because the current market
value “does not sufficiently reflect the fundamentals” of its
performance, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
