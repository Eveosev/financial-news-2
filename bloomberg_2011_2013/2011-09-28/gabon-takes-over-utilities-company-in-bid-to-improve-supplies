Gabon’s  government became the main
shareholder in the Societe d’Electricite, de Telephone et d’Eau
du Gabon, a closely held utility company, as it seeks to improve
supplies.  The state injected 106 billion  CFA francs  ($218 million) in
the company, it said in a statement handed to reporters in
Libreville, the capital, today. The company will compete with
Societe d’Energie et d’Eau du Gabon, which also provides
utilities in the central African nation.  Gabon wants to review the terms of a concession agreement
between SEEG and Veolia Environnement SA of  France , according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
