Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained on
speculation commercial lenders will lower  interest rates  after
inflation slowed for the first time in more than a year.  Consumer prices climbed 22.42 percent in September from a
year earlier, easing from a 23.02 percent pace in August,
according to figures released by the General Statistics Office
on Sept. 24.  “The slowing of inflation on a monthly basis is a positive
signal, supporting investors’ expectation that banks will reduce
lending rates,” said Luu Hai Yen, an analyst at Thang Long
Securities Joint-Stock Co. in Hanoi.  The yield on the benchmark five-year notes fell three basis
point, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.42 percent today,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was steady at 20,832 per dollar as of 3:48 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank
fixed the  reference rate  at 20,628 today, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
