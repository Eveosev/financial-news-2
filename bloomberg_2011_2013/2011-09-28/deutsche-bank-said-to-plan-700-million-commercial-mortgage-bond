Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  is marketing about
$609 million in bonds backed by commercial property loans in the
first offering of its type since sales revived in November 2009.  The issue will be tied to floating-rate mortgages including
debt on the Hotel del Coronado, located on oceanfront property
near  San Diego , and the Standard Hotel in  Manhattan , according
to people with knowledge of the offering. The Frankfurt-based
lender has been assembling the pool for at least eight months,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
discussions are private.  Wall Street banks are seeking to unload loans made before
turmoil in credit markets that has cut into bank profits on new
commercial-mortgage sales. Bankers have retooled offerings sold
since August after demand shriveled amid a spreading European
debt crisis and concern the U.S. economic recovery has stalled.  The transaction is tied to the debt of 52 properties and
includes a $356.3 million portion with the top credit grades,
according to one of the people.  Amanda Williams, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, declined
to comment.  Floating-rate loans, which are short-term and give property
owners more flexibility to pay off the debt early, are often
taken out when owners are anticipating a significant boost in
income from the properties, and can be riskier for investors.  Blackstone Hotels  The Deutsche Bank transaction is the first so-called
floater to compile debt from multiple borrowers since the
commercial-mortgage  bond market  slammed shut in 2008 amid a
lending freeze. Banks arranged a combined $66.4 billion in
floating-rate commercial-mortgage backed securities in 2006 and
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In June,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  sold $425 million in
floating-rate commercial mortgage securities linked to 13 hotels
owned by the  Blackstone Group LP. (BX)   Lenders have issued about $25 billion in commercial-
mortgage backed securities this year, compared with about $11.5
billion in all of 2010, Bloomberg data show. Sales plummeted to
$3.4 billion in 2009 compared with a record $234 billion in
2007, the data show.  Investors are demanding 295 basis points, or 2.95
percentage points, to hold top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds
rather than Treasuries, according to a Barclays Capital index.
Spreads reached 303 basis points on Aug. 25, the most since June
2010, and are up from this yearâ€™s low of 178 on April 26.  Editors: Pierre Paulden, John Parry  To contact the reporter on this story:
