Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the software maker
seeking to challenge  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s dominance in
smartphones, agreed to share patents with handset-maker Samsung
Electronics Co.  Microsoft will receive royalties for mobile phones and
tablets built by Samsung that use Google’s Android operating
system, according to a statement today. The companies also
agreed to cooperate on the development and marketing of Windows
Phone, Microsoft’s mobile software.  Smartphones with Microsoft’s revamped Windows Phone 7
software have struggled to compete with Apple’s iPhone and
Android-based devices. Microsoft, whose Windows Mobile software
licenses were doubling annually before the iPhone was introduced
in 2007, announced an alliance with  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  in February to
develop smartphones.  Microsoft, based in Redmond,  Washington , fell 10 cents to
$25.58 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung added 0.4 percent to 807,000
won in Seoul trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
