Citic Securities Co. raised HK$13.2
billion ($1.7 billion) in  Hong Kong ’s biggest public stock
offering in more than three months, two people with knowledge of 
the matter said.  China ’s biggest brokerage by market value sold 995.3
million shares at HK$13.30 apiece, said the people, who declined
to be identified because no announcement has been made. The
stock was initially offered at HK$12.84 to HK$15.20 before banks
managing the sale raised the low end of the range to HK$13.30,
they said.  Citic Securities’ sale is the biggest in Hong Kong since
Italian fashion retailer Prada SpA raised $2.5 billion in June.
The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  is down 20 percent since June and
the value of initial public offerings in the city has fallen by
64 percent from the previous quarter amid  Europe ’s escalating
sovereign debt crisis.  “With a lot of uncertainties surrounding EU countries,
investors are reluctant to put their money to work,” said
Victoria Mio, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at Robeco, whose
fund subscribed to the offering.  The final price is a 7.6 percent discount to Citic
Securities price in Shanghai of 11.78 yuan, as of the 11:30 a.m.
close of the morning session.  One-Off Case  The sale could prove a one-off case, Mio said. “They put
money in this one because Citic is a leader in one of the
growing brokerage markets where the  capital market  is continuing
to open up.”  The final price values Citic Securities at 1.28 times
estimated 2011 book value and 8.95 times forecast 2011 earnings,
one of the people said. Sukyi Yau, a Hong Kong-based outside
spokeswoman for Citic Securities, declined to comment on the
final pricing.  Companies have raised $3.9 billion from IPOs in Hong Kong
so far in the third quarter, down from $10.7 billion in the
second quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Citic
Securities sale comes just days after XCMG Construction
Machinery Co. scrapped plans for a $1.1 billion Hong Kong
offering and rival construction equipment maker Sany Heavy
Industry Co. delayed a $3.3 billion sale.  Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte and  Kuwait Investment
Authority  are among so-called cornerstone investors who agreed
to buy $850 million of Citic Securities shares, according to a
prospectus released on Sept. 21. Cornerstone investors are
guaranteed shares in the offering in return for a pledge not to
sell their stock immediately.  To contact the reporter on this story:
