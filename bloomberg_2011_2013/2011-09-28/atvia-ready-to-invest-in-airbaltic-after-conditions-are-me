Latvia  is ready to invest 57.6
million lati ($110.3 million) in airline AirBaltic AS after
conditions including changing the shareholder agreement are met,
said Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis.  “These talks have been more constructive and there is more
confidence that the private shareholder is ready to meet all the
conditions,” Dombrovskis said today on the  Latvian Independent
Television  Program 900 Seconds. A shareholder’s meeting is
scheduled for tomorrow where a final agreement may be reached,
he said.  The government has demanded that as part of the capital
increase the company’s Chief Executive Officer Bertolt Flick, a
German who controls AirBaltic from Berlin, step down, and the
shareholder agreement be amended that gives Baltic Aviation
Systems, the minority shareholder, control of the company.  Flick left Latvia after the anti-corruption bureau
conducted a series of raids that included AirBaltic offices in a
probe that also targeted a member of parliament in May. The
anti-corruption bureau carried out another series of searches of
Baltic Aviation Systems and AirBaltic offices yesterday,  Leta 
reported, citing Juris Petersons, a representative of BAS.  The state owns 52.6 percent of the airline while Baltic
Aviation Systems has 47.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
