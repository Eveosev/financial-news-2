Bloomberg's Rich Jaroslovsky 
reviews Ooma Inc.'s Telo Air that allows users of the Telo "Free
Home Phone Service" box to connect over a Wi-Fi network.  Like its competitors from Vonage Holdings Corp. and 
magicJack VocalTec Ltd., Ooma uses Voice over Internet Protocol 
that runs calls over the Internet rather than dedicated phone 
lines or cellular signals. (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 02:31
