European private-equity
transactions have declined as the debt crisis has worsened and
banks have tightened up on lending, the Financial Times
reported, citing figures from the Centre for Management Buyout
Research at  London ’s Imperial College.  The value of buyout transactions fell to 12 billion euros
($16.3 billion) in the third quarter, from 15.3 billion euros in
the second, the newspaper said.  The value of transactions in the first three quarters of
the year, at 41.5 billion euros, was little changed from the
year-earlier period, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
