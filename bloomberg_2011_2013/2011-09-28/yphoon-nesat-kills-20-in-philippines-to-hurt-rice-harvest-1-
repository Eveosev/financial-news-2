Typhoon Nesat, which hit the
 Philippines ’ most populous Luzon island, left at least 20 people
dead and dimmed prospects for a record rice harvest.  “Had it not been for this storm, we could reach record
output this year,” Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala said in
an interview with DZRH Radio, when asked about rice production.
“We’re praying for the sun to shine.”  Nesat was centered about 380 kilometers (238 miles)
northwest of Baguio City on the north coast of Luzon at 11 a.m.
local time today and was accelerating with maximum winds of 130
kilometers per hour as it moved away from the country, the
 weather bureau  said today. A new tropical storm will likely
enter the country within 24 hours, ABS-CBN News reported, citing
the weather bureau’s officer-in-charge Graciano Yumul.  The number of “affected” people reached 171,570 in 22
provinces, with almost 53,000 being served inside and outside
evacuation centers, the disaster risk agency said. The death
count has risen to 20, Civil Defense Administrator Benito Ramos
told reporters in  Manila  today.  The Philippines gets hit by an average of 20 cyclones each
year that form over the  Pacific Ocean  to the east. In September
2009, Tropical Storm Ketsana submerged most of the nation’s
capital after dumping 41 centimeters (16 inches) of rain in six
hours, killing more than 300 people.  Rice Harvest  The Southeast Asian nation, previously the world’s biggest
buyer of rice, cut imports by more than half to 860,000 tons
this year from 2.5 million tons in 2010 as domestic production
increased. The local harvest rose 14.4 percent to 7.577 million
tons in the first half and will increase 6.2 percent to 9.72
million tons in the second, according to data from the Bureau of
Agricultural Statistics.  The country will probably meet its production target of
more than 17 million tons this year, helping slash imports in
2012, said Alcala on Sept. 26.  Provinces in Luzon island represent half of the total rice
harvest, according to the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics. The
agriculture agency is assessing crop damage, Alcala said today.  The central bank is also reviewing the extent of the damage
on crops and its impact on inflation, said Deputy Governor Diwa
Guinigundo in a mobile phone message to reporters today.  Hydroelectric  power plants  will get “priority dispatch”
to bring down water levels in dams, Energy Secretary Rene
Almendras said. About 189,000 of Manila Electric Co.’s 4.9
million customers were still without electricity as of this
morning, the company said. That compares with 44 percent that
were without power at midday yesterday after Nesat flooded
streets and wind toppled trees and electric poles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
