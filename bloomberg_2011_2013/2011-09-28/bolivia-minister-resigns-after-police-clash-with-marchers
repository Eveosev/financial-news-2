Bolivia’s minister of the interior,
Sacha Llorenti, stepped down today after indigenous groups
demanded his resignation because of a clash with police.  Hundreds of police launched tear gas on Sunday at more than
1,000 indigenous marchers protesting a government-planned
highway that would cut through their territory. The road, which
is largely financed by loans from  Brazil ’s development bank,
BNDES, would link the Bolivian states of Cochabamba and Beni.  Bolivia’s President  Evo Morales  said in a press conference
yesterday he did not order the attack on marchers and that the
event will be investigated. Construction on the road has been
halted, Morales said.  Indigenous communities say the government did not respect
their constitutional right to be consulted on a road through
their territory before the project began and plan to carry out
more marches.  Bolivia’s largest union organization, the Bolivian Worker’s
Center, has backed the indigenous communities and has called a
nation-wide strike Wednesday in their support.  Defense Minister Maria Cecilia Chacon resigned yesterday in
solidarity with marchers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
