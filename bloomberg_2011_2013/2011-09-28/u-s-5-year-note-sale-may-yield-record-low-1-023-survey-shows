The Treasury’s $35 billion sale of
five-year notes may draw a record low auction yield of 1.023
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in September 2016, yielded
1.020 percent in pre-auction trading, which would be the lowest
in Bloomberg data beginning in 1994. The record low auction
yield of 1.029 percent was set last month. Bids are due by 1
p.m. New York time.  Today’s offering is the same size as the past 12 monthly
five-year debt auctions. The yield on Aug. 24 was down from
1.580 percent in the previous month.  The August sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.71.
The average for the past 10 offerings is 2.76.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42.1 percent of the notes at the August
sale, more than the 10-sale average of 39.2 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealers that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, bought 13.9 percent of the
securities at last month’s offering. That compares with an
average of 10.9 percent at the past 10 sales.  More than $61.2 billion of maturing five-year securities
are held by the public and the Fed, including $57.8 billion by
the public and $3.4 billion by the central bank, according to
Treasury data. Today’s auction is a net pay-down of $26 billion.  Note Returns  Five-year notes have returned 7.7 percent this year,
compared with an 8.2 percent gain for the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Today’s auction is the second of three note sales totaling
$99 billion this week. Yesterday’s $35 billion auction of
two-year notes produced the highest demand in a year. The U.S.
will auction $29 billion of seven-year securities tomorrow.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in U.S. debt
auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
