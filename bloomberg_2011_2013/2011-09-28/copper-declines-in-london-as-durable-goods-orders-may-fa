Copper tumbled more than 5 percent
in  New York  on concern that stagnating global growth will reduce
demand for raw materials.  The MSCI World Index of equities dropped as much as 1.4
percent today on growing concern that divisions among European
leaders over how to handle  Greece ’s debt crisis will prolong the
region’s fiscal woes. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities tumbled as much as 2.8 percent  “Clearly, the global economy is slowing after several
years of sovereign support, which will not be available the
second time around,” analysts at  RBC Capital Markets  led by
 Randy North  in New York wrote in a report today.  Copper futures for December delivery dropped 19.3 cents, or
5.6 percent, to settle at $3.2465 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the

August 2010. The metal has retreated 24 percent since June 30,
heading for the biggest quarterly loss since the period ending
December 2008.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell $343, or 4.5 percent, to $7,251 a metric ton ($3.29
