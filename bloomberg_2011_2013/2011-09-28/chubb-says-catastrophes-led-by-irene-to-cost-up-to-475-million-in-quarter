Chubb Corp. (CB) , an insurer of high-end
homes and corporate boards, said disasters led by  Hurricane
Irene  will cost the company $400 million to $475 million before
tax this quarter.  The claims will reduce earnings by as much as $1.07 a share,
the Warren, New Jersey-based company said today in a statement
distributed by PR Newswire. Losses from Irene will probably be
$300 milion to $375 million in the quarter, Chubb said.  Irene, the first hurricane to strike the U.S. since 2008,
lashed the U.S. East Coast last month, downing trees and flooding
homes in states from North Carolina to New York. The storm
will weigh on results at insurers including Chubb and
Northbrook, Illinois-based Allstate Corp. that suffered higher-
than-average losses in the second quarter on tornado costs.  Chubb will release complete third-quarter financial results
on Oct. 20 after 4 p.m.,  New York  time, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
