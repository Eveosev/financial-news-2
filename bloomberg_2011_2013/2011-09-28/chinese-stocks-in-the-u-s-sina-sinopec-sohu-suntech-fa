The Bank of New York Mellon  China 
ADR Index, which tracks American depositary receipts, declined
2.7 percent to 361.18. The New York Stock Exchange China Index
slid 2.5 percent to 218.85. The Shanghai Composite Index
retreated 1 percent to 2,392.06.  The following companies were among the most active Chinese
shares in New York trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses and
prices are as of the close of trading at 4 p.m. New York time.  Oil futures dropped 4.4 percent to $80.70 a barrel on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , set for the biggest quarterly loss
since 2008.  China Petroleum and Chemical Corp. (SNP US), the country’s
biggest refiner known as Sinopec, fell 1.8 percent to $95.84.  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  , China’s largest offshore energy
producer, retreated 0.5 percent, the first decline in four days,
to $164.13.  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  , the operator of China’s fifth-most
visited website, tumbled 11 percent to a one-year low of $53.11.
The drop in Sohu’s share price triggered a short-selling
restriction by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
which forces traders who want to bet on declines to wait once a
stock falls 10 percent from the prior day’s closing level.  Sina Corp. (SINA US), owner of China’s third-most popular
website, sank 6.9 percent to $81.10, the lowest in more than
three months. Short selling interest in Sina rose to 9.3 percent
of its outstanding shares as of yesterday, from 7.6 percent a
week earlier, according to  Data Explorers , a New York-based
research company. The short-sale restriction, also called Rule
201, which was triggered Sept. 26 by declines in the company’s
shares, was lifted today.  Suntech Power Holdings (STP US), the world’s largest maker
of solar panels, slid 3.1 percent to a record low of $2.53.
 Germany , the world’s biggest solar-panel market, added 664
megawatts of the devices in June, a 69 percent drop from the
same period last year, according to preliminary figures from the
German power grid regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
