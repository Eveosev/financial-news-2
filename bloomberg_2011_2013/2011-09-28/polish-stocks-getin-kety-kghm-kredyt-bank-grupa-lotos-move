Poland ’s WIG20 Index fell 21.64, or
1 percent, to 2,181.67 at 10:01 a.m. in Warsaw, heading for the
first daily decline this week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Getin Holding SA (GTN)   climbed for a second day, adding
0.18 zloty, or 2.5 percent, to 7.34 zloty. The financial-
services group controlled by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki was
upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at Raiffeisen Centrobank AG.  Grupa Kety SA (KTY PW) headed for the biggest one-day gain
in a month, adding 3.6 zloty, or 4.1 percent, to 90.6 zloty.
Poland’s biggest aluminum products maker expects third-quarter
net income to reach 32 million zloty ($9.9 million) to 33
million zloty as sales advanced to as high as 400 million zloty,
a record level, the company said in a regulatory statement.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, fell 1.5 zloty, or 1.1 percent, to
136 zloty, falling for a second time this week. Copper declined
on concerns that European leaders’ divided opinions to tame a
sovereign debt crisis may damp demand for commodities.  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB)   jumped 0.46 zloty, or 4 percent, to
11.95 zloty, heading for the biggest two-day gain in six weeks.
Banco Santander SA has completed initial due diligence on the
lender and made its owner, KBC Groep NV, a preliminary offer,
Gazeta Wyborcza reported, citing two people it didn’t identify.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , an oil refiner that the Polish
government is seeking to sell, declined 0.23 zloty, or 0.9
percent, to 25.25 zloty. Oil fell in  New York , heading for the
biggest quarterly decline since 2008, as investors speculated
reports will show slowing global growth that may curb fuel
demand amid rising U.S. supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
