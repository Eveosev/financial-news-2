The rate at which London-based
banks say they can borrow for three months in dollars rose for a
14th day, reaching the highest level since August 2010.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans rose to 0.36856 percent from 0.36522 percent yesterday,
according to data from the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest since Aug. 13, 2010.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was at 27.96 basis points at 11:53 a.m. in London, from
27.82 yesterday. The spread reached 28.95 basis points on Sept.
19, the widest on a closing-price basis since July 27, 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, widened to
35.84 basis points from 35.51 basis points yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
