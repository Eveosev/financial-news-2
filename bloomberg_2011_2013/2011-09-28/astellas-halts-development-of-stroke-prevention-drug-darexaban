Astellas Pharma Inc. (4503)  will
discontinue global development of darexaban maleate, a drug for
preventing strokes and blood clots, because competition has
increased in the sector and it can’t find a partner to develop
and commercialize the drug.  The discontinuation won’t affect the Japanese drugmaker’s
earnings forecast for this fiscal year, according to a statement
on Astellas’ website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
