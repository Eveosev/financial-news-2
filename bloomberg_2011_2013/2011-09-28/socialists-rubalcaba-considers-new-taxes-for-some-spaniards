Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the
Socialists’ candidate for the general election, said he will
propose additional taxes for certain groups in  Spain , on top of
his plans for a wealth tax and a levy on banks.  “We are going to ask certain sectors to make an effort,”
he said in a televised news conference in  Madrid  today. “I’ve
already spoken about two; there will be more sectors of society
whom we ask to make an effort.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
