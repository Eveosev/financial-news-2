NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of
NYSE Euronext, will start publishing traders’ holdings within
the market for its London commodity contracts as of Oct. 3.  The report, designed in a similar format to the one
published by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will
be published every Monday at 12 p.m. London time, the exchange
said in a notice to members dated Sept. 27 and e-mailed today.
It will refer to positions reported to the exchange by the close
of business the previous Tuesday, it said.  Traders on NYSE Liffe will have to report positions in
excess of 100 lots for all delivery months on the cocoa, white
sugar, robusta coffee and feed wheat contracts, the exchange
said in a separate statement e-mailed today.  “The introduction of these reports will enhance market
transparency for the commodities futures contracts listed on the
London market,” Ian Dudden, director for commodity derivatives
at NYSE Liffe, said in a statement.  A group of 16 cocoa consumers wrote to Liffe in July last
year to complain about a lack of transparency after the cocoa
contract saw the biggest delivery since 1996, warning that they
might transfer trading to ICE Futures U.S., according to a copy
of the letter obtained by Bloomberg News.  The U.S. CFTC produces weekly reports on speculator and
commercial holdings in commodities including gold, oil and
cocoa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
