An agreement by two  Repsol YPF SA (REP) 
investors in August to vote their shares in a bloc may be
approved by Spain’s energy regulator tomorrow, El Mundo said,
citing unidentified people close to the agency.  A majority on the board of Spain’s Comision Nacional de
Energia, including Chairman Alberto Lafuente, is leaning in
favor of approval, the  newspaper  said.  A major role is being played by Finance Minister  Elena Salgado , who has expressed opposition to the agency quickly
approving the accord between  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  and Mexico’s
Petroleos Mexicanos, El Mundo said.  The commission, which is studying whether the Mexican  oil
company  needs permission to raise its stake and gain influence
over regulated energy assets, didn’t consider the matter at its
board meeting yesterday, it said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
