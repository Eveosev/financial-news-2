The cost of protecting  China ’s
sovereign debt from default jumped to the highest level since
March 2009, according to data provider CMA.  Credit-default swap contracts on China surged 16 basis
points to 170, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in privately negotiated
markets.  “Everyone is getting more concerned about risks
accumulating domestically,” said  Ju Wang , a fixed-income
strategist at  Barclays Capital  in Singapore. “Eventually in
China, the burden in the banking sector will have to be
reflected in the sovereign balance sheet.”  China will permit local governments to sell bonds in a
pilot program in the fourth quarter, the official Xinhua News
agency said today, citing a person it didn’t identify. Local
government debt grew to 10.7 trillion yuan, some 27 percent of
the country’s gross domestic product, as of the end of 2010,
according to a national audit released on June 27.  Developers in China face an “increasingly severe” credit
outlook, which may force them to cut prices,  Standard & Poor’s 
said in a Sept. 27 report.  --Henry Sanderson. Editors: Shelley Smith, Beth Thomas  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
