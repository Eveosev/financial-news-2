News Corp. (NWSA) ’s U.K. publishing unit,
which ran the News of the World tabloid at the center of a
phone-hacking scandal in Britain, plans to fight termination
claims by a former employee.  Neville Thurlbeck, the former chief reporter of the
tabloid, has said he was unfairly dismissed from News
International in a case brought to an employment tribunal, the
Guardian  newspaper  reported today, without saying how it got the
information.  The company will “vigorously contest this case” a News
International spokeswoman said. The tribunal will have a
preliminary hearing in London on Friday. Police arrested
Thurlbeck in April.  The former chief reporter of the News of the World, which
was shut down in July, has played a key role in the controversy
about what management at News Corp. knew about the scope of
phone hacking in the newsroom. His name appeared in an e-mail
labeled “for Neville” that contained the transcripts of hacked
voicemails and was shown to managers as evidence that reporters
illegally accessed voicemails of celebrities and politicians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
