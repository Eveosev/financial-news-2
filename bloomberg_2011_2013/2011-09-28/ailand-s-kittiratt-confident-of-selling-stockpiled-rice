Thailand  is “confident” that it
will be able to sell rice from state stockpiles through
government-to-government contracts, Commerce Minister Kittiratt
Na-Ranong said today.  The government is ready to renegotiate a contract to sell
rice to  Indonesia , after the sale was canceled because of a low
offering price, Kittiratt said. The government is negotiating to
sell rice to other countries, he said, without naming them.  Thailand’s government plans to start paying farmers
guaranteed prices for rice on Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
