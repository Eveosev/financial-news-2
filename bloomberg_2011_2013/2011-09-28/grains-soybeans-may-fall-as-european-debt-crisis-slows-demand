What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that demand
for food, animal feed and fuel made from the crop will drop as
the U.S. economy slows and Europe’s debt crisis reduces consumer
confidence,  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in
Fowler, Indiana, said in a telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 9 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on concern that European leaders are divided on
plans to tame the region’s sovereign-debt crisis, potentially
prolonging the fiscal woes and slowing commodity demand, Gerlach
said.  -- Soybean futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago on concern that global demand is waning for cooking
oils and animal feed made from the crop, Gerlach said. Soybean-
oil futures are expected to open down 0.05 cent to 0.1 cent a
pound, and soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $2 lower for
2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
