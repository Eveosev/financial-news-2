Banks that don’t lean on trading or
 investment banking  for profits may report “very good” third-
quarter earnings, dodging market turmoil, said  Thomas Brown ,
chief executive officer of Second Curve Capital LLC.  “It’s the capital-markets banks, the ones that rely on
trading, the ones that rely on investment-banking activities --
that’s where the weakness is,” Brown said in an interview today
with Bloomberg Television’s Betty Liu and Dominic Chu. “There’s
7,300 other banks that are going to report a very good third
quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
