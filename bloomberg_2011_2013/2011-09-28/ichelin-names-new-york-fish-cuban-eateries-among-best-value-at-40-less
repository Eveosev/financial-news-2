A Cuban restaurant in Chelsea and a
pork and seafood joint in  Brooklyn  today join the list of venues
the Michelin guide says offer value for money in  New York .  The addition of Coppelia and Traif takes to more than 110
the number of recommended establishments serving two courses and
a glass of wine or dessert for $40 or less, excluding tax and
gratuity, Michelin said in an e-mailed press release.  The Bib Gourmand winners were named today as a prelude to
the announcement, scheduled for Oct. 5, of “Michelin Guide New
York City 2012.” The winners and losers in the U.K. and Ireland
are to be published the following day.  Michelin & Cie. is the world’s second-biggest tiremaker,
after  Bridgestone Corp. (5108)  It produced its first guide in August
1900, distributed free of charge (until 1920) and intended for
chauffeurs. The guide contained practical information, including
street maps and tips on using and repairing tires. The guide is
based in Paris, and Michelin in Clermont-Ferrand,  France .  To contact the writer on the story:
