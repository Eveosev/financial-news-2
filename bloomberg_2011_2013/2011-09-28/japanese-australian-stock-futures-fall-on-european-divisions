Japanese and Australian stock
futures fell amid concern that divisions among European leaders
will hamper efforts to solve the region’s debt crisis, damping
the earnings outlook for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics that gets 21 percent of its
sales in Europe, slid 1.5 percent from the closing share price
in Tokyo. Those of  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-
largest bank by market value, fell 2.8 percent. ADRs of  Woodside
Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s oil and gas producer, dropped 0.9
percent after crude prices slid.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 8,560 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,640
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,560 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index dropped 1.4 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
fell 0.5 percent in Wellington.  “It’s all about Europe,” saidKenichi Hirano, general
manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in  Tokyo .
“The focus is whether they can establish a unity, and the
market’s going through ups and downs according to
developments.”  Japan’s retail sales rose 0.2 percent in August after
dropping 0.3 percent in July, according to the median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the government
releases the data today.  Greek Debt  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.2
percent today. In  New York , the index fell 2.1 percent yesterday
after an official said the European Commission is resisting a
push to impose bigger writedowns on banks’ holdings of Greek
government debt than those agreed at a July 21 summit.  The commission opposes ideas that are being floated by some
government officials to get banks to accept bigger so-called
haircuts and doesn’t want to have talks about any such attempt,
the official said on condition of anonymity because the
deliberations are private.  Italian and Spanish financial market regulators extended
temporary bans on short selling of financial shares that were
introduced last month in a bid to stem market volatility, the
European Securities and Markets Authority said.  Crude oil for November delivery declined $3.24 to settle at
$81.21 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 17 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8.5 percent drop by the  S&P
500  and a 18 percent drop by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 11.6 times for the S&P 500
and 9.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
