Boeing Co. (BA)  named Donna Hrinak, a
former U.S. ambassador to  Brazil , to lead a new office being
established by the world’s second-largest maker of commercial
aircraft to expand in the South American nation.  Hrinak will start Oct. 14 as president of Boeing Brazil at
the office in  Sao Paulo , the Chicago-based company said today in
a statement. She held the diplomatic post in Brazil from 2002 to
2004 and most recently was PepsiCo Inc.’s vice president for
global public policy and government affairs, Boeing said.  “Donna has the right combination of business, government,
regional and local experiences to lead Boeing in this important
market,” Shep Hill, president of Boeing International, said in
the statement. Hrinak will report to Hill.  Brazil is  Latin America ’s biggest economy. The nation
offers Boeing the opportunity to expand sales of products and
services and form partnerships in technology, industry and
finance, Hill said. The country’s biggest airlines now fly 152
Boeing aircraft, and the company is among three competitors for
a contract to supply Brazil’s military with 36 fighter jets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
