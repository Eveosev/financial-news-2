Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-
largest bank by assets, received more consumer banking
complaints than any other lender in the first half of 2011,
according to data compiled by the U.K.  Financial Services
Authority .  Barclays received 162,611 banking complaints, resolving 95
percent of them within eight weeks, the FSA said. Santander U.K.
Plc was second with 139,386 complaints, and  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, racked up the most
insurance complaints with 111,897. The overall number of
consumer protests rose 3 percent.  Complaints against banks will continue to rise, Paul Clark,
chief executive officer of complaints management firm Charter
U.K., said, because they face “payment protection insurance
mis-selling, regulatory changes to complaints handling and the
FSA’s tougher stance on overall financial regulation.”  The British Bankers’ Association, an industry group, lost a
court challenge in April to the FSA’s payment protection
insurance guidelines. The improper sales of PPI are “likely to
lead to a redress of 9 billion” pounds ($14 billion) Hector Sants, chief executive of the FSA, said in June.  London-based Barclays said that customer service is a
priority for the bank.  “Delivering excellent service to our customers is our goal
every single day, in every single way a customer interacts with
us,”  Antony Jenkins , CEO of Barclays Retail said in an e-mailed
statement. “When we do get it wrong, we apologize, try to
correct it quickly and identify how to prevent it from
reoccurring.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
