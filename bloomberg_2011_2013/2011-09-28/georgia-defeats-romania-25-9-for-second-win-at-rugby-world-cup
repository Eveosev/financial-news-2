Georgia  defeated Romania 25-9 in
their Pool B match for its second-ever victory at the Rugby
 World Cup .  Merab Kvirikashvili set a Georgian record by scoring 17
points with five penalties and a conversion, while Mamuka
Gorgodze scored a try for the victors in Palmerston North,  New
Zealand .  The match between the two bottom teams in Pool B ended with
Georgia beating Romania for the fifth time in their last six
matches. Romania exits the event having lost five World Cup
matches in a row. Georgia takes on Argentina, which is second in
the group behind  England , on Oct. 2.  “At the beginning, we tried to find ways to break through
the Romanian scrum, which is their strength,” Georgia vice-
captain Ilia Zedginidze said. “We improved a little.”  The match started with the sides trading penalties, with
Georgia leading 12-6 at halftime.  Gorgodze touched down in the 56th minute to open up some
space between the sides. It was his 19th Test try, passing
Malkhaz Urjukashvili to become Georgia’s all-time top try-
scorer.  Kvirikashvili’s 70th-minute penalty made him the first
Georgia player to kick five penalties in a match. Urjukashvili
finished the scoring with a penalty, moving within four points
of the country’s record points-scorer Pavle Jimsheladze.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
