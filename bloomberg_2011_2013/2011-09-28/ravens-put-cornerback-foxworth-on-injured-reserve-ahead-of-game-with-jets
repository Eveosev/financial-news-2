The  Baltimore Ravens  placed
cornerback Domonique Foxworth on season-ending injured reserve
because of complications with his surgically-repaired right knee
that forced him to miss last week’s game.  Foxworth, 28, missed the 2010 National Football League
season after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament.  While he appeared in the Ravens’ first two games this
season, Foxworth said he played “conservatively.” The Ravens
deactivated him for last week’s win over the  St. Louis Rams .  Foxworth has eight career NFL interceptions and finished the
2009 season with three over the final three games for the Ravens
(2-1), who this week host the New York Jets (2-1).  To contact the reporter on this story:
