The ruble weakened against the
dollar, extending its worst quarter since 2009 as oil retreated
amid concern the global recovery is faltering.  Russia ’s currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 31.75 against
the dollar by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow. The currency has
depreciated 12 percent this quarter, the biggest drop since the
three-month period ended March 2009.  Stocks in the U.S. and  Europe  fell on concern holders of
Greek bonds will suffer larger losses than previously agreed.
Urals crude, Russia’s main export blend, dropped 0.2 percent to
$105.38 a barrel.  With “the global economy and demand for oil sagging, the
prospects for a strong Russia look increasingly unlikely,”
Peter Rosenstreich, chief currency analyst at Swissquote Bank SA
in Geneva, said by e-mail.  The ruble has dropped 9.1 percent against the dollar this
month. It was little changed at 43.2147 per euro today, leaving
it down 0.1 percent at 36.9091 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Investors pared bets the ruble will depreciate further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing it dropping to 32.2065 in
three months’ time, compared with 32.2124 yesterday. NDFs
provide a guide to expectations of currency movements and
interest-rate differentials.  There’s a “significantly higher” chance the ruble will
strengthen rather than weaken against the dollar and euro in the
coming weeks, Central Bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev told
reporters in Moscow yesterday. The bank is “entirely
satisfied” with the parameters of the current corridor the
central bank uses to smooth fluctuations in the ruble rate, he
said.  Ignatiev’s “verbal intervention was a way to support the
ruble and offset potential inflation pressures and general mass
emerging-market migration,” Rosenstreich said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
