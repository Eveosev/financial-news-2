Malaysia ’s ringgit fell on
speculation global funds will cut their holdings in local-
currency assets as the lingering debt crisis in  Europe  damped
risk-taking.  The currency erased earlier gains, paring yesterday’s 1.1
percent rally, which was its biggest advance since June 2010.
Reports showed Franklin Templeton Investments cut its holding in
South Korean bonds yesterday and BNP Paribas SA said it has
moved money out of local-currency bonds. Ringgit-denominated
bonds have stalled this month and are poised to end a seven-
month rally.  “There’s still the risk of fund outflows from Asian
markets if Europe fails to put actions to work,” said Lam Chee Mun, a  fund manager  in Kuala Lumpur at TA Investment Management
Bhd. “We still think there is further downside to the market.”  The ringgit declined 0.2 percent to 3.1565 per dollar as of
4 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has depreciated 4.3 percent since June 30, headed
for its first quarterly loss since March 2009.  The currency earlier gained as much as 0.6 percent after
Germany yesterday pledged support for Greece. Greek lawmakers
voted 155 to 142 yesterday to approve a property tax to help
plug the budget shortfall, taking it a step closer to securing
an 8 billion-euro ($11 billion) aid package next month.  Malaysian assets are “undervalued,” Prime Minister Najib
Razak said in Kuala Lumpur late yesterday.  Malaysian three-year notes fell for a second day, driving
yields up to the highest in seven days. The yield on the 3.434
percent note due August 2014 climbed 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 3.29 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.
The rate reached a seven-week high of 3.81 percent on Sept. 19.  Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and  Barclays Capital  have
singled out Indonesia, Malaysia and  South Korea  as the most
vulnerable to a bond market selloff, citing a high proportion of
foreign ownership of local debt.  Global funds owned 186.5 billion ringgit ($59 billion)
ringgit-denominated securities in July, according to data
published by Bank Negara Malaysia, including a record 95.4
billion ringgit of  government bonds . The central bank will
publish August data on Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
