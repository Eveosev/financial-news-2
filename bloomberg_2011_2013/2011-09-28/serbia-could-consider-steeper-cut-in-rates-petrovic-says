The Serbian central bank has room
to consider a “steeper cut” in borrowing costs because
inflation is “no longer the concern,” the head of the
country’s Fiscal Council Pavle Petrovic said.  “Now that inflation is no longer the concern and it is
definitely going to be in the single digits, the central bank
could consider a steeper cut in the benchmark rate to give
support to the slowing economy,” Petrovic said at a bank
conference today in Belgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
