Turkey’s state asset sales agency
may offer the power grid on the Asian side of Istanbul to
Enerjisa Enerji Uretim AS, the power company owned by Austria’s
 Verbund AG (VER)  and  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL) , Vatan said.  The deadline falls tomorrow for Yildizlar SSS Holding AS,
second-placed in a December auction for the grid, to pay the
collateral needed to secure purchase rights for $1.8 billion,
the newspaper reported, without saying how it got the
information.  Should Yildizlar not pay, the agency will offer the network
to Enerjisa, which was third in the auction, Vatan said.
Enerjisa’s bid was $1.5 billion, compared with the winning bid
of $1.8 billion by MMEKA Makina İthalat Pazarlama & Ticaret AS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
