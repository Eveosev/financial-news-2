Cyprus’s economy will grow as much
as 1.5 percent of gross domestic product next year, helping the
budget deficit to shrink to 2.3 percent of GDP from as much as
6.5 percent of GDP this year, Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias
told reporters in Nicosia today.  The island’s economy will expand between 1 percent and 1.5
percent next year after growth of as much as 0.5 percent of GDP
this year, Kazamias said. Public debt will reach 65 percent of
GDP this year and stay at the same level in 2012, Kazamias said.
The government aims to rein in the deficit to about 1 percent of
GDP in 2013, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
