European Central Bank Governing
Council member Yves Mersch said liquidity shortages pose the
main risks to the European banking system.  “Liquidity risks together with sovereign and funding risks
constitute for the time being the main threats not only to the
European banking system but I would say are the main topic of
most of our gatherings,” Mersch said in Luxembourg today. “The
recent intensification of tensions in the sovereign  debt market 
has led to contagion risk which is of systemic nature,” he
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
