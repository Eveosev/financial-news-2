Sony Corp. (6758)  acquired Micronics Inc.
to accelerate research on healthcare products, in the Japanese
company’s first buyout of a medical equipment developer.  Redmond, Washington-based Micronics develops devices used
for disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and blood testing,
Tokyo-based Sony said in a statement today, without disclosing
financial terms.  The acquisition is Sony’s first in the medical equipment
industry, said Chisato Kitsukawa, a Sony spokesman. The Japanese
company, which offers displays, cameras and printers for medical
institutions, is considering ways to expand in the healthcare
field where the company’s electronics technologies, such as
optical discs, can be applied, he said.  Founded in 1996, closely held Micronics has received
financial backing from individuals and investment firms such as
River Cities Capital Funds, according to the company’s  website .
The company employs about 30 people, Kitsukawa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
