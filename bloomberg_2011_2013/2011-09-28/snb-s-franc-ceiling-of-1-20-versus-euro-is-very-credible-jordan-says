The Swiss central bank’s franc
ceiling of 1.20 versus the euro is “very, very credible,” Vice
President Thomas Jordan said.  “Our policy is crystal clear,” Jordan said at an event in
Basel late yesterday. The  Swiss National Bank  “introduced a
minimum  exchange rate  versus the euro and we will use all
measures to defend it. This very clear commitment has led to us
being taken very seriously in the market. We’re not afraid of
markets.”  The SNB on Sept. 6 imposed a franc ceiling for the first
time since the 1970s and resumed purchases of foreign currencies
to protect the economy. Efforts to stem franc gains in the 15
months through mid-June 2010 boosted currency holdings on the
bank’s balance sheet and contributed to an annual loss of $21
billion as the euro’s value plummeted.  The franc, considered a haven in times of turmoil, has
remained above 1.20 versus the euro since the SNB imposed the
ceiling. It reached an all-time high of 1.0075 on Aug. 9 and
traded at 1.2217 against the euro at 9:08 a.m. in Zurich.  Jordan declined to comment on whether policy makers will
raise the cap.  Slowing Growth  While Swiss lawmakers had previously criticized the SNB’s
intervention policy and called for President Philipp Hildebrand
to resign over the losses, faltering economic growth and waning
export demand have since prompted all five government-coalition
parties to support renewed efforts to weaken the franc. The KOF
Economic Institute on Sept. 27 cut its growth forecasts for both
this year and next, and said the franc remains overvalued.  Before imposing the cap, the SNB’s foreign-currency
holdings jumped to a record 253.4 billion francs ($282 billion)
at the end of August. That’s about half of Swiss gross domestic
product. It will publish September reserves on Oct. 6.  Jordan said  a central bank “cannot become illiquid” and
the franc ceiling helped reverse some foreign-currency losses.  “Yet, even with the minimum exchange rate, our balance
sheet remains vulnerable to valuation changes,” he said.
“Unfortunately, the risks have not disappeared. Losses could
still occur on other currencies, or on gold. The amounts
involved can build up rapidly, owing to the size of the balance
sheet.”  ‘Thin Air’  The Zurich-based SNB is able to create francs “out of thin
air,” Jordan said, suggesting policy makers have enough
firepower to ward off investors if needed. The central bank has
also lowered borrowing costs to zero and boosted liquidity
supply to the money market to weaken the currency.  The SNB’s decisions are “always driven by motives other
than profit,” with policy makers aiming to ensure  price
stability  while “taking due account of the development of the
economy,” he said.  “This extensive use of monetary-policy tools was, and
remains, necessary to ensure the fulfillment of our legal
mandate,” Jordan said. It “enabled the SNB to weather the
effects of the recent crisis relatively successfully” even if
the measures “have taken a considerable toll on our balance
sheet and our income statement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
