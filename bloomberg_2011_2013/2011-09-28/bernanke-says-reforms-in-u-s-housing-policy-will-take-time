Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said an overhaul of U.S. housing policy won’t likely
occur any time soon since the economy is still healing.  “There’s pretty general agreement that whatever reforms
need to take place” will probably “take some time,” Bernanke
said today in response to a question after a speech in
Cleveland. He was asked about the possible spinoff of
government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac .  The Fed chairman said U.S. unemployment is a “national
crisis” and that monetary policy “is not a panacea.” He said
he understands the concern among savers about low interest
rates.  Even so, “nobody is better off if the economy continues to
be so weak,” he said.  -- Editors: James Tyson  To contact the reporter on this story:
