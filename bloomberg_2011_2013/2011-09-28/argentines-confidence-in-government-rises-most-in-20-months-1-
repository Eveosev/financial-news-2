Argentines’ confidence in their
government rose the most in 20 months in September, according to
a survey released by  Torcuato Di Tella University  in Buenos
Aires.  Confidence in President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s
administration jumped 18 percent from August to a reading of
2.64 on a scale of zero to five. The increase is the biggest
since a 21 percent gain in January 2010. The index rose 49
percent from a year earlier, according to the poll.  About 65 percent of those surveyed said Fernandez, who is
running for a second term in Oct. 23 presidential elections, is
facing up to the country’s problems or knows how to resolve
them, 13 percentage points more than in August, according to the
Sept. 1 to Sept. 9 poll of 1,200 people. The survey, conducted
by  Poliarquia Consultores  on behalf of the Buenos Aires-based
University, had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points.  Fernandez, 58, who succeeded her late husband  Nestor Kirchner  as President in December 2007, received 50.2 percent of
votes in an open primary held on Aug. 14. Under her government,
South America’s second-biggest economy has expanded an average
5.6 percent per year.  About 52 percent of people surveyed said they have a good
opinion of the government, eight percentage points more than in
August, while 45 percent said they think the government is
efficient in its management of public spending, seven points
more than last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
