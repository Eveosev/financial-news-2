Charter Plc’s refusal to discuss a
possible takeover by  Melrose Plc (MRO)  and solicit another bidder is a
“victory for short-termism” and a defeat for long-term
investors,  Schroders Plc (SDR)  said in a statement today. Schroders
said it was disappointed but not surprised that Melrose had
withdrawn its offer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
