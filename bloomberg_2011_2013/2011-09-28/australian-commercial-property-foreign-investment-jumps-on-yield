Foreign investment in Australian
commercial property jumped in the third quarter, drawn to high
yields and low economic risks,  CB Richard Ellis Group Inc. (CBG)  said.  Overseas buyers accounted for 41 percent of the A$2.49
billion ($2.45 billion) in commercial properties sold in
 Australia  in the three months ended Sept. 30, according to
preliminary data from Los Angeles-based CB Richard Ellis. This
compares with 34 percent in the second quarter and a long-term
average of between 10 percent and 15 percent, the group said in
an e-mailed release.  “While local economic commentators are concerned the
latest turmoil in overseas financial markets will lead to an
eventual slowing in economic growth, it hasn’t yet dampened
interest in investing in Australia,” Kevin Stanley, executive
global director for global research and consulting at CB Richard
Ellis, said in the release.  Overall sales slowed 23 percent from the previous quarter,
and 28 percent from a year ago, the report said. Investors from
 Singapore  accounted for 71 percent of overseas buyers, Chinese
for 16 percent and the U.S. for 10 percent, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
