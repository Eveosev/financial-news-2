Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Asia ’s biggest
automaker, reported an increase in global vehicle production for
the first time in 12 months led by a quicker recovery in Japan.  Output in August rose 10.6 percent to 626,817 vehicles, the
first increase after the government ended subsidies for fuel-
efficient cars last September and the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami, the Toyota City, Japan-based company said in a
statement today. Domestic output gained 12 percent to 252,374,
while overseas production rose 9.8 percent to 374,443, it said.  Japanese carmakers including Toyota have been hiring
temporary workers to boost production from October, as they aim
to make up for lost output after the earthquake and tsunami that
devastated northeastern  Japan  caused shortages of parts and
electricity. Toyota resumed full production at all of its North
American plants this month and said it will expand U.S. output
of small engines.  “The bottleneck disruptions in the parts supply seem to be
ending quicker than expected,” said  Satoru Takada , an analyst
at TIW Inc. in Tokyo. “Supply of parts, including
microcontrollers, have normalized, helping Toyota’s production
return to normal.”  Toyota began recruiting temporary workers from July and
plans to add as many as 4,000 in Japan.  Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s second-biggest carmaker, built
385,112 vehicles worldwide last month, 24 percent more than a
year earlier.  Back to Normal  Carmakers plan to return to operating on Mondays through
Fridays from next month at their domestic facilities, after
shifting operation days and weekends from July to September to
help avert power outages.  Toyota plans to operate for additional 10 days to make up
for lost production in the first half, said Amiko Tomita, a
spokeswoman for Toyota in  Tokyo . The automaker expects supply at
dealerships worldwide to normalize by March, she said.  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said
yesterday demand for cars in Japan in the six months ending
March 31 may rise 17 percent from a year earlier to 2.97 million
vehicles, while it expects a 3.3 percent decline to 4.45 million
for the full fiscal year.  Honda Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest carmaker, said its
global production in August fell 9.3 percent to 261,524 vehicles
from a year earlier.  Toyota shares rose 0.7 percent to 2,678 yen at the 3 p.m.
close of Tokyo trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
