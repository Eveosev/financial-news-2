The leaders of Italy’s main
opposition parties said they are concerned about the
government’s inability to decide on a candidate to succeeed
 Mario Draghi  as Bank of Italy governor.  “We are greatly concerned about the continued uncertainty
about the government’s choice of the new governor” the head of
the  Democratic Party ,Pierluigi Bersani, and leader of the Union
of Center, Pierferdinando Casini, said in an e-mailed statement.  “Instead of providing certainies and stability, the
goverment keeps the country dangerously on the brink for purely
personal reasons,” the statement said.  The government failed to propose a candidate to a meeting
of the central bank’s superior council today, a month before
Draghi is due to leave to head the European Central Bank.  Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper reported today that Finance
Minister Giulio Tremonti is insisting that  Vittorio Grilli ,
director general of the Treasury be named to the post, while
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi planned to name the central
bank’s director generalFabrizio Saccomanni to the job.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
