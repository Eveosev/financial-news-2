European companies acquired by
private-equity firms will struggle to refinance more than
200 billion euros ($272 billion) of leveraged buyout debt as
investors eschew risky securities,  Fitch Ratings  said.  “A raft of lower-rated issuers still must find ways to
address looming refinancings in 2013 and 2014,” according to
the report by Edward Eyerman, the London-based head of European
leveraged finance at Fitch Ratings.  The deepening sovereign crisis in  Europe  is closing avenues
for the most vulnerable borrowers to replace maturing debt after
a record 36.8 billion euros of sales in the first half, Fitch
said. Sales of high-yield bonds have dried up as concern that
Greece will default prompts investors to favor larger, less-
indebted companies that can withstand a slowing economy.  “Prolonged uncertainty over refinancing and the
macroeconomic outlook will keep many of these companies in
operational limbo, potentially threatening their
competitiveness,” according to Eyerman.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  today raised 300 million euros,
bringing high-yield issuance to $2.1 billion since the start of
August, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with $7.8
billion of sales in July. High-yield debt is graded below BBB-
by Fitch and  Standard & Poor’s  and Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service.  European LBOs have more than 200 billion euros of debt to
refinance between 2012 and 2014, predominately lower-rated
companies in the B ratings category, according to Fitch.  European high-yield funds have endured eight consecutive
weeks of outflows, losing $1.8 billion this month to take the
net year-to-date withdrawal to $4.3 billion, according to a
Sept. 23 report from Bank of American Merrill Lynch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
