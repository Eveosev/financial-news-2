South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus said the global economy is in a “danger zone” and
recent financial market turmoil indicates the world is close to
another “Lehman-type” event.  The depreciation in emerging-market currencies represent an
“overshoot” and it may ease as risk appetite improves, she
said in an opinion article published in Johannesburg-based
Financial Mail today.  South Africa  should increase trade with
Africa, Asia and other emerging markets, such as Brazil and
India, to help offset the impact of slower growth in  Europe ,
Marcus said.  “Growth also needs a domestic focus and there is an urgent
need to revive domestic investment,” as gross fixed capital
formation remains below the peak reached before the 2008 global
crisis, she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
