A second person died from wounds
sustained in a protest in  Mauritania  against the country’s
population census, said Wane Abdul Birane, the coordinator of
a group that organized the demonstrations.  The deaths happened in the city of Maghama, 570 kilometers
(354 miles) south of Nouakchott, the capital, as police
attempted to halt yesterday’s protest by black Mauritanians
against the census they claim is racist, said Birane, whose
Don’t Touch My Nationality movement organized the event. Both
people were shot, he said by phone today.  Home Minister Mohamed Ould Boilil confirmed the death of
one of the protesters in a statement yesterday that was
 published  by state-owned news agency AMI. The census process,
which started in May, will continue, he said, adding that no
one is allowed “to disturb the peace of the citizens or
interfere with public order.”  Mauritania’s ethnic groups include people of Arab-Berber
origin, descendents of former slaves and black Africans who
settled in the south of the country near the Senegal river,
according to the U.S. State Department’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
