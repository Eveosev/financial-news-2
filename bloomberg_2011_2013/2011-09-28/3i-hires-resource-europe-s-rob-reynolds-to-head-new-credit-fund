3i Group Plc (III) , Britain’s biggest
publicly-traded private equity firm, said it hired Rob Reynolds
from Resource  Europe  Management Ltd. to run a new fund.  Reynolds was previously chief investment officer at
Resource Europe, a manager of collateralized loan obligations,
London-based 3i said in a statement today. He will report to
Andrew Golding at 3i Debt Management.  The Credit Opportunity Fund targets investments in bonds,
loans and floating-rate notes mainly in Europe. The fund has 50
million euros ($68 million) of  seed capital  from 3i Group and
will open to other investors later, according to the statement.  3i Debt Management started its first credit fund in October
2007 to invest primarily in senior and junior secured loans. It
delivered an annual return of 13.6 percent and reaped profit of
1.4 times when it was redeemed in March 2011, according to 3i.  To contact the reporter on this story:
