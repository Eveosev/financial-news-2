Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
declined 0.8 percent to 4,008.30 at the 4:10 p.m. close of
trading in Sydney, approaching slides of 6.7 percent for the
month and 13 percent for the quarter.  New Zealand ’s  NZX 50 Index (NZSE50FG)  was little changed at 3,300.17
in Wellington.  The following were among the most-active shares in the
market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company
names.  Mining stocks: A measure of primary metals traded in  London 
fell 3.2 percent yesterday. Copper futures for December delivery
dropped 5.6 percent in  New York  amid concerns a slowing global
economy may reduce demand for the metal.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s No. 1 mining
company, fell 1.4 percent to A$35.04. BHP sees no waning of
iron-ore consumption amid a slowdown in the global economy and
its order books are full,  RBC Capital Markets  said, citing a
company presentation.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO AU), the world’s second-largest mining
company by sales, slid 2.5 percent to A$62.45 in Sydney.  A Namibian court declared a strike at Rio’s Rossing uranium
mine in the southern African country illegal, Rio said in an e-
mailed statement.  Oil stocks: Crude oil for November delivery rose as much as
0.7 percent today.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  , Australia’s second-
biggest oil and gas producer, gained 0.6 percent to A$32.14.
 Santos Ltd. (STO)  , Australia’s third-largest oil and gas
producer, increased 1.9 percent to A$11.27.  Gold producers: Gold futures for December delivery sank 2.1
percent in New York yesterday as the dollar’s rebound eroded

retreated 2.4 percent to A$2.01.  Alumina Ltd. (AWC AT), an Australian producer of alumina,
gained 2.8 percent to A$1.46 on speculation recent price drops
may make the company a takeover target. The decline in Alumina’s
share price would make it cheaper for a rival to buy the company
than develop projects, said Jamie Spiteri, Sydney-based head
dealer at Shaw Stockbroking Ltd.  Carsales.com.au Ltd. (CRZ)  , Australia’s automotive
website, gained 1.3 percent to A$4.75. The stock was raised to
“buy” from “underperform” at BBY Ltd.  CSL Ltd. (CSL)  , a maker of blood-derived therapies,

Administration in 2010 and 2011 have been addressed.  CSG Ltd. (CSV)  , which offers computer and technology
services, surged 44 percent to A$1.04. The company said it has
received a non-binding, indicative and confidential proposal to
acquire all its shares at A$1.20 cash each.  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  , Australia’s biggest
lender to companies, sank 2 percent to A$22.50. The company
reiterated support for its U.K. branches after Moody’s Investors
Service cut some ratings of its Clydesdale Bank in the U.K.  Paladin Energy Ltd. (PDN)  , a uranium producer, tumbled
11 percent to A$1.17 after resuming trading today. The company

regulatory filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
