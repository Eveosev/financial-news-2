French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
party treasurer received 50,000 euros ($67,900) in cash from a
French billionaire five months before the May 2007 presidential
election,  Liberation  said today, citing an interview with the
billionaire’s former accountant.  Claire Thibout, who had been the accountant for L’Oreal SA
heiress Liliane Bettencourt, said she regularly prepared
envelopes of cash for as much as 150,000 euros and turned them
over to Patrice de Maistre, Bettencourt’s financial adviser.
They were given to politicians at Bettencourt’s home in the
Paris suburb of Neuilly, she told the newspaper.  The only envelope whose recipient she was specifically
aware of was a 50,000-euro payment to  Eric Woerth , then
treasurer of Sarkozy’s party, the Union for a  Popular Movement ,
Thibout told Liberation. De Maistre asked her to prepare the
cash in January 2007 and told her who it was destined for,
Liberation said, citing Thibout.  Sarkozy and his then-wife, Cecilia, were among the
political figures who visited the Bettencourt home during that
period, she said, according to the newspaper.  Woerth’s lawyer, Jean-Yves LeBorgne, and de Maistre and his
lawyer, Pascal Wilhelm, didn’t immediately return messages left
by Bloomberg News today seeking comment.  Bettencourt “absolutely” denies the allegations, Jean- Rene Farthouat, her lawyer, said to Bloomberg News.     Sarkozy
spokesman  Franck Louvrier  declined to comment on the Liberation
article.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
