Taiwan ’s government bonds rose on
speculation the central bank will leave borrowing costs
unchanged when it meets tomorrow as a global economic recovery
falters. The local currency strengthened for a second day.  The island’s monetary authority will end a run of five
interest-rate increases at a quarterly review tomorrow,
according to 12 of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest
predict an increase of 0.125 percentage point. Policy makers in
Indonesia,  South Korea  and the Philippines all left borrowing
costs unchanged this month on concern a sputtering  U.S. economy 
and  Europe ’s debt crisis will sap demand for exports from Asia.  “There’s not much the Taiwan central bank can do but to
follow its Asian peers in halting rate increases,” said  Albert
Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Cathay United Bank
Co. “Movements of yields will be largely affected by whether
European officials come up with a strong solution to the debt
crisis.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due September 2021 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.28 percent as of
9:29 a.m. in Taipei, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  Taiwan’s dollar advanced 0.2 percent to NT$30.405 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency has dropped 4.7 percent this month and 5.6 percent this
quarter.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, fell one basis point to 0.388 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
