U.S. stocks erased gains as
declines in commodity producers and health-care companies led
the market lower following an early rally triggered by growth in
capital-goods orders.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index lost 0.2 percent to 1,173.6
at 10:19 a.m. in  New York  after rallying as much as 0.8 percent
in early trading.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
