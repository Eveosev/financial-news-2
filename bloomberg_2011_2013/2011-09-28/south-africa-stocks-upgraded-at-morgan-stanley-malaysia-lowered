South African stocks were upgraded
to “overweight” from “equal weight” at Morgan Stanley amid
rising earnings, analysts led by  Jonathan Garner  wrote in a
report dated today.  South Africa  saw “improvement” in consensus earnings
growth compared to the rest of emerging markets, the analysts
wrote. The benchmark FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index has lost
4.3 percent this year, outperforming the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index’s 22 percent slump in 2011.  Morgan Stanley also cut Malaysia to “equal weight” from
“overweight,” citing earnings revisions and weaker industrial
output. Government data on Sept. 9 showed industrial production
contracted 0.6 percent from a year earlier, compared with growth
of 2.4 percent that economists had forecast in a Bloomberg
survey.  “The weakness in industrial production is a reflection of
poor export performance,” Garner wrote.  Malaysia’s FTSE Bursa  Malaysia  KLCI Index has dropped 10
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
