Investors are scaling back bets on
real estate, deterred by concerns about a global economic
slowdown and as funds run out of time to allocate the money they
have raised, a study by DTZ Group Plc showed.  Money earmarked for real-estate investment globally through
2012 fell to about $316 billion from $329 billion six months
ago, according to the study by the London-based adviser. While
investment targeting property  Asia  and  Europe  fell, there’s been
a 3 percent increase in funds targeting U.S. real estate since
March to $114 billion, the report showed.  The euro region’s 18-month sovereign-debt crisis and
concerns about a recession in the U.S. are slowing growth around
the globe, reducing the potential for a rise in property values
and rents. About $166 billion pledged by investors to real-
estate funds since 2008 will be withdrawn after asset managers
struggled to find opportunities to spend it by a set time, DTZ
estimates.  “The current economic uncertainties are likely to impact
on new capital raising for some time to come,” DTZ’s Global
Head of Research Hans Vrensen said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
