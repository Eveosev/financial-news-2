Thailand ’s  finance ministry  cut its
economic growth forecast for this year as the faltering global
recovery threatens demand for exports and floods damage
agricultural crops.  The economy may grow 3.8 percent to 4.3 percent in 2011,
compared with a June forecast for a 4 percent-to-5 percent
expansion, said Boonchai Charassaengsomboon, director of the
finance ministry’s macroeconomic policy bureau. Gross domestic
product may increase 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, he said.  “Problems in the U.S. and  Europe  remain key risk factors
for global demand and may affect our exports,” Boonchai said at
a briefing in Bangkok today. The economy may grow 4 percent to 5
percent next year, he said.  Europe’s debt crisis and a weakening U.S. recovery are
threatening growth in  Asia , prompting central banks from  South
Korea  to the  Philippines  to refrain from rate increases in
recent months. The Bank of Thailand plans to cut its own
economic growth projections when it releases new estimates next
month, Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said on Sept. 24,
signaling there is less scope to raise  interest rates  further.  Thailand’s central bank lifted the benchmark rate to 3.5
percent on Aug. 24, the ninth increase since the start of July
2010, and said the rate is now close to “normal levels.”  Rate Forecast  The finance ministry expects the rate to remain at 3.5
percent this year and rise to 3.75 percent next year, Boonchai
said. Thailand’s economy will improve next year, buoyed by
government policies aimed at spurring consumption and a recovery
in the global economy, he said. The forecast for 2011 economic
growth has a midpoint of 4 percent, he said.  Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has pledged to
boost the daily  minimum wage  to 300 baht ($10), almost double
the current level in some parts of the country, and buy rice
from farmers at as much as 42 percent above market rates,
spurring concern inflation will quicken.  The baht may average 30.5 per dollar this year and 30 per
dollar next year, Boonchai said. The currency dropped 0.4
percent to 31.02 as of 2:30 p.m. in Bangkok, taking its decline
this month to 3.5 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Food Prices  Thai inflation accelerated to 4.29 percent in August, the
fastest pace since 2008, as rising food prices countered a
decline in oil costs. Core inflation, which excludes fresh food
and fuel, was 2.85 percent. The central bank uses  core inflation 
to guide monetary policy and aims to keep the gauge at less than
3 percent.  The Bank of Thailand expects GDP to increase 4.1 percent in
2011 and 4.2 percent next year.  Thailand, the world’s largest rice exporter, yesterday cut
its estimate for output from its main harvest of the grain by
2.4 percent after floods damaged farmland.  As many as 173 people have been killed in the past two
months as floodwaters spread across 57 of Thailand’s 77
provinces, according to the government. The annual deluge may
cost the economy between 20 billion baht and 40 billion baht
this year, Boonchai said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
