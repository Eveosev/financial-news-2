Chilean policy makers may reduce
their benchmark  interest rate  three times in the next year as
inflation trails the central bank’s target, according to a
survey of traders and investors released today.  The central bank will keep its key rate unchanged for the
fourth straight month at 5.25 percent in October, cutting to 5
percent by January, 4.75 percent by April and 4.5 percent by
October next year, according to the bi-weekly survey published
on the bank’s website.  Chile has the highest interest rates among major Latin
America economies behind Argentina and  Brazil , which in August
cut borrowing costs after five months of increases. Chile has
space to follow Brazil’s lead if the world economy deteriorates,
central bank President Jose De Gregorio said last week.  “We are a country with a lot of space for cutting rates,
but whether we cut or not will depend on economic conditions,”
he said in an interview in  Washington . “It’s very difficult to
say which way we should go, but of course we have space because
inflation is on target.”  Annual inflation, which accelerated to 3.2 percent in
August from 2.9 percent in July, will fall to 2.8 percent in 12
months, according to today’s survey of 50 respondents. The
central bank targets annual inflation of 3 percent.  Chile’s peso was little changed at 505.75 per  U.S. dollar 
at 7:32 a.m. New York time from 505.6 yesterday. The peso will
trade at 506 per dollar in seven days, according to today’s
survey.  The country’s one-year interest-rate swap, unchanged at
4.52 percent today, has fallen from 4.63 percent on Sept. 15
when policy makers last met.  To contact the reporter on this story:
