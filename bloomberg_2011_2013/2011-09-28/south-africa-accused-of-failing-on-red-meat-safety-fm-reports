South Africa ’s department of
agriculture is facing industry complaints over its alleged
failure to enforce legislation to ensure the safety of red meat,
the Financial Mail said.  The Red Meat Industry Forum has lodged a complaint against
the department at Parliament, saying it’s not regulating
slaughterhouses as required by law, is allowing privately owned
quarantine camps and is failing to control the cross-border
movement of animals, the FM said, citing the Forum’s submission.  The department has also failed to ensure South Africa is
reinstated as a foot-and-mouth-free zone at the World
Organization for  Animal Health  after an outbreak earlier this
year. This costs the country’s livestock industries about 4
billion rand ($500 million) in annual lost sales, the FM said.  Selby Mokaba, spokesman for the department, was in a
meeting when contacted on his mobile phone and couldn’t
immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
