Go Daddy Group Inc.’s $750 million
term loan to support its buyout by KKR & Co.,  Silver Lake
Partners  and Technology Crossover Ventures rose in initial
trading, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The seven-year debt, sold to investors at 93 cents on the
dollar, began trading at 94.5 cents and rose to 95 cents, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the trades are
private.  Michael Zimmerman, chief financial officer of Scottsdale,
Arizona-based Go Daddy, didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Canada, KKR
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. arranged the loan with an interest
rate of 5.75 percentage points more than the London interbank
offered rate and a 1.25 percent floor on the lending benchmark,
Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
