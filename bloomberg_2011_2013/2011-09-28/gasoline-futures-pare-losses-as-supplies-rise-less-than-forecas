Gasoline futures pared losses after
the Energy Department reported stockpiles rose less than
expected last week.  The government said gasoline inventories gained 791,000
barrels to 214.9 million in the week ended Sept. 23. The median
estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a
1 million-barrel increase.  Gasoline for October delivery fell 1.45 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.681 a gallon at 10:37 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices were $2.6745 before the reportâ€™s
release at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Stockpiles of heating oil and diesel rose 72,000 barrels to
157.7 million in the seven days ended Sept. 23. Analysts
forecast a 400,000-barrel decrease, according to the survey.  October-delivery heating oil fell 0.26 cent to $2.874 a
gallon, from $2.8776 before the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
