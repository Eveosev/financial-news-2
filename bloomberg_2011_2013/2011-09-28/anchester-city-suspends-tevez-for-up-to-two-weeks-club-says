Manchester City soccer club
suspended striker  Carlos Tevez  for as long as two weeks while it
investigates his alleged refusal to play in a 2-0 Champions
League loss at Bayern Munich last night.  City manager  Roberto Mancini  said he wanted to put Tevez
into the game in the second half and the 27-year-old refused.
Argentina international Tevez, who sought to leave City this
summer to return to South America and be closer to his family,
denied the accusation.  “Tevez has been suspended until further notice for a
maximum period of two weeks,” City said in a  statement . “The
player’s suspension is pending a full review into his alleged
conduct during Tuesday evening’s 2-0 defeat to Bayern Munich.”  Tevez, who won’t be considered for selection or take part
in training during the review, said today he didn’t refuse to
play and apologized to City fans for a “misunderstanding” that
left him on the bench.  “I had warmed up and was ready to play,” Tevez said,
according to a statement cited by the Daily Mirror. “This is
not the right time to get into specific details as to why this
did not happen, but I wish to state that I never refused to
play.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
