Zimbabwean Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai  said the country’s “warped” policy of forcing
companies to sell majority stakes to blacks eroded confidence
and delayed investments.  “The matter of indigenization has caused discord within
government,” Tsvangirai told reporters today in Harare, the
capital. “The principle itself, the implementation and the
legal framework is a matter of conflict.”  Investors are also worried about uncertainty over when
elections will be held in the southern African nation, he said.  Zimbabwe, which has the world’s second-biggest reserves of
platinum and chrome after neighboring  South Africa , wants all
foreign and white-owned companies to submit plans to sell 51
percent stakes in local assets to black Zimbabweans.  Tsvangirai is leader of the  Movement for Democratic Change 
that is in a power-sharing government with President  Robert
Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
