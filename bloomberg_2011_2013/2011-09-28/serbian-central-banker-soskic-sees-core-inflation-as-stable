Serbian  core inflation , excluding
food and regulated prices, is stable, central bank Governor
Dejan Soskic said.  The central bank believes it can return inflation to levels
that can be considered within the bank’s target by the first
quarter of next year and has “never thought” of revising its
goals, Soskic told a bank conference today in Belgrade.  The economy may grow as much as 2.5 percent this year if
the agricultural sector does well, Soskic said.  The Balkan nation is not excessively indebted but any
further increase in public debt shouldn’t exceed the pace of
economic growth.  “Otherwise we would risk investor confidence,” he said.  Serbia will “make sure” that the new Eurobond issued last
week is used for new calculation of  Serbia ’s risk premium,’’
which will certainly wipe out part of the risk, he said,
referring to the Emerging Market Bond Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
