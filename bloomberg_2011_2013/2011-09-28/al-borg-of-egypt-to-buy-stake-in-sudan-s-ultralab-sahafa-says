Al Borg Laboratories, a medical-
diagnostics company controlled by Abraaj Capital, will acquire a
majority stake in Ultralab, a Sudanese laboratory-testing chain,
al-Sahafa reported.  Ultralab operates 11 laboratories in  Sudan  in the Khartoum,
Om Dorman and Port Sudan regions, the Khartoum-based newspaper
said, without citing anyone.  Calls to Al Borg and Abraaj’s offices by Bloomberg seeking
comment didn’t connect. Abraaj owns 90 percent of shares of Al
Borg, according to Al Borg’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
