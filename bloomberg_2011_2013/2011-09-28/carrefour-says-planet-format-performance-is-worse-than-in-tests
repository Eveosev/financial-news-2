Carrefour SA (CA) , the world’s second-
largest retailer, said its new Planet stores aren’t matching the
performance of the format’s trial outlets.  “They are doing worse -- still much better than what we
committed, but worse than the pilot stores,” Chief Commercial
Officer Jose Carlos Gonzalez-Hurtado told reporters at the World
Retail Congress in Berlin today.  Carrefour is revamping its hypermarket format in an effort
to revive sales in France, its largest market. Planet stores
offer more aisle space, children’s play areas and larger
sections for categories like frozen or organic foods, beauty
products and fashion. Trial stores have been operating since
last year. The retailer will run 50 Planet outlets by the end of
September, Gonzalez-Hurtado said.  The company has been able to cut investment spending on
refurbishing stores to the Planet format to half the cost of
setting up the trial outlets because it has bought more fixtures
in bulk and more efficiently, Gonzalez-Hurtado said. Planet is
beating the company’s forecasts for earnings, the executive
said.  Carrefour, which is based in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-
Billancourt, cut its full-year group profit forecast in August,
saying it expects a decline of about 15 percent amid a slump in
 France .  To contact the reporter on this story:
