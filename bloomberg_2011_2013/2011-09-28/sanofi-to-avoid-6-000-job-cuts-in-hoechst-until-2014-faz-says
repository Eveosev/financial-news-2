Sanofi SA will avoid compulsory
redundancies until 2014 for at least 6,000 of 7,500 employees at
its operation in Hoechst,  Germany , the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung reported in an article published on its website today,
citing a company spokeswoman.  The decision follows a “personnel planning” framework
agreement reached by management and employee representatives,
the newspaper reported, adding that the agreement did not
mention a previously planned cut of about 380 to 400 jobs in
Hoechst, reported in August.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
