Spain  will freeze power prices for
consumers in the fourth quarter even after the cost of
electricity rose by cutting payments for the use of the
transmission grid, according to an industry ministry official.  The move won’t increase the so-called tariff deficit, the
shortfall between the power system’s revenues and its costs,
said the official, who asked not to be named in line with
government practice.  The cost of baseload power for the fourth quarter rose 9
percent from the year earlier period in a government-run auction
held yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
