The productivity surge that helped
boost U.S. economic growth since 1997 has probably ended,
according to a researcher at the  Federal Reserve Bank of New
York .  There is a 90 percent chance gains in worker output per
hour have fallen to levels consistent with the quarter-century
of slow growth that spanned 1973 to 1997,  New York  Fed economist
Robert Rich wrote in a report today on the bank’s  Liberty Street
Economics  blog. The report was co-written with James Kahn, an
economics professor at Yeshiva University and a former New York
Fed economist.  The productivity slowdown probably began in 2004 and has
pushed efficiency gains closer to the 1.5 percent “low-trend
growth” seen during the early 1970s and late 1990s from the 3
percent increases seen during the “high-trend growth” period
that followed, the report said. In the next five years, the
researchers estimate productivity will rise by less than 2
percent a year.  As U.S. productivity gains picked up between the late 1990s
and early 2000s, former Fed Chairman  Alan Greenspan  recognized
accelerating worker efficiency would contain inflation even as
the economy gained strength and unemployment stayed low. The
realization allowed the Fed to keep  interest rates  little
changed from 1996 to 1999.  Potential gross domestic product is around 2.5 percent,
where it’s been for the last eight years, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
