India ’s rupee rose past 49 a dollar
to the highest level in a week on optimism European leaders will
find a solution to contain the region’s debt crisis.  The currency extended its biggest gain since December after
Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won parliament backing
yesterday for a property tax that would pave the way for further
aid, while German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said  Europe ’s largest
economy is ready to offer assistance. Today’s performance is
only a “short-term reprieve” for the markets, according to
Sailesh K. Jha, head of Asia strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken AB.  “There is some optimism after the positive news out of
Europe,” Singapore-based Jha said. “However, there are still a
lot of details to be worked out in terms of the European policy
announcements, so over the next several weeks we will see
pressure on equity markets pick up again and with that we will
also see the dollar strengthening against Asian currencies.”  The rupee strengthened 0.7 percent to 48.7525 a dollar at
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier touched 48.6575, the highest level since
Sept. 21. The currency rose the most in almost 10 months
yesterday, and is down 8.4 percent this quarter.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 49.43 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 49.78 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
