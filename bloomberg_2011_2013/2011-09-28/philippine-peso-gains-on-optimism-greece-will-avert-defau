The  Philippine peso  advanced the
most in three months as signs of progress in tackling Europe’s
debt crisis helped revive demand for emerging-market assets.
 Government bonds  rose.  Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou won support in
parliament yesterday for a new property tax to help raise
revenue and narrow the nation’s budget deficit. German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  said her nation would help Greece meet
the terms of its bailout.  “People are taking the recent developments in Europe
positively,” said Antonio Espedido, a treasurer at China
Banking Corp. in Manila. “There’s more demand for riskier
assets, which is benefiting emerging markets like the
Philippines.”  The peso gained 0.9 percent to 43.495 per dollar as of
10:26 a.m. in  Manila , it biggest gain since June 21, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc. Currencies in Asia’s developing nations
strengthened yesterday, when financial markets in the
Philippines were shut yesterday due to a typhoon.  The yield on the government’s 5.875 percent bonds due
January 2018 dropped 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point,
to 5.4 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
