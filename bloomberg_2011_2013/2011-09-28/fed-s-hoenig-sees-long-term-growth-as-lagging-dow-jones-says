Federal Reserve Bank of  Kansas City 
President  Thomas Hoenig  said he expects the U.S.’s long-term
growth rate to be about 2.5 percent, trailing behind the average
of more than 3 percent for the past 25 years, Dow Jones
Newswires reported.  The forecast represents a significant drop in gross
domestic product for coming generations, Hoenig said in a speech
today in Kansas City, according to Dow Jones.  Hoenig, 65, steps down as the central bank’s longest-
serving policy maker this week, after serving as a regional
chief since 1991. He is departing from a divided Federal Open
Market Committee that is grappling with the best way to support
the recovery. The central bank’s decision last week to push down
longer-term interest rates risks drew three dissenting votes,
the second straight month that the most opposition within the
group has been tallied in almost 19 years.  Hoenig, who doesn’t vote on the committee this year, voiced
concern about the direction of the central bank’s policies
because they encourage consumption and the build-up of debt, Dow
Jones said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
