Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP)  shares
may gain in the next 60 days after the firm underperformed
rivals including  Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) , said Nigel Dally, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.  Ameriprise, the provider of financial-planning services,
“has superior capital flexibility, lower portfolio risks, lower
interest rate risks, yet is trading at a lower price-earnings
multiple,” Dally said in a note today.  The firm dropped 24 percent on the New York Stock Exchange
since the end of July through yesterday, compared with a 13
percent decline at  Des Moines , Iowa-based Principal. Investors
have bet that Federal Reserve action to stimulate the economy
may limit returns by driving down long-term  interest rates .  Principal’s price at yesterday’s close was about 8.6 times
earnings, compared with a ratio of 8.2-to-1 at Minneapolis-based
Ameriprise, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ameriprise
slipped $1.35, or 3.3 percent, to $39.99 at 4 p.m. in composite
trading. Principal dropped 94 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $23.01.  “We are very confident about our long-term growth strategy
and, in addition, have delivered strong earnings,” said Susan Houser, a spokeswoman for Principal, the seller of  life
insurance  and retirement products, in an e-mailed statement.  Net income at Principal for the first six months of this
year jumped about 38 percent from the same period in 2010 to
$470.8 million. Profit at Ameriprise climbed 16 percent to $550
million for first half of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
