Crude oil prices pose a challenge
to India’s central bank, limiting its monetary-policy options,
Deputy Governor  Subir Gokarn  said today.  “Even as concerns about global economic activity have
started to increase, oil prices have remained very steady,”
Gokarn said at a conference in New Delhi today. “This is a huge
problem to deal with, because it reduces the space monetary
policy has in responding to the cycle.”  Concerns that the debt crisis in Europe will hurt global
growth haven’t deterred Brent crude in London from rising 36
percent in the past year, fanning inflation in the South Asian
country. Energy costs account for about 15 percent of the
wholesale-price index in India, which depends on imports to meet
80 percent of its annual oil requirements.  The Reserve Bank of  India  has increased its benchmark
repurchase rate 12 times starting March 2010, the last of which
was on Sept. 16, to tame the fastest pace of price gains among
the so-called BRICS economies. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said
this week in  New York  that inflation is “fairly stubborn,”
even as his counterparts in other Asian nations from South Korea
to Malaysia kept borrowing costs unchanged this month.  India’s benchmark wholesale-price inflation of 9.78 percent
in August compares with consumer price gains of 7.2 percent in
Brazil, 8.2 percent in Russia, 6.2 percent in China and 5.3
percent in  South Africa  last month from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
