TMX Group Inc. (X)  Chief Executive
Officer Thomas Kloet said there is regulatory uncertainty in
potential takeover offers for the operator of the Toronto Stock
Exchange.  “There is a great deal of regulatory uncertainty with
regard to any of these acquisitions,” Kloet said today in an
interview with Bloomberg Television in New York.  Maple Group Acquisition Corp., a group of 13 Canadian
financial-services companies including  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  and
 Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , has offered to buy TMX for C$3.73
billion ($3.65 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
