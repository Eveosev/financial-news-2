Thai rice prices, the benchmark for
 Asia , rose 1.3 percent, close to the highest level since
December 2009, as the government’s plan to start grain purchases
next month boosted domestic prices, according to the Thai Rice
Exporters Association.  The price of 100 percent grade-B white rice climbed to $627
a metric ton, from $619 a ton on Sept. 21, said Pisanu Sangyoo,
an official at the association. The price rose to $629 a ton on
Sept. 7, the highest level since December 2009.  The price of 25 percent broken rice increased to $559 a
ton, from $554 a week earlier, he said. The exporters’
association holds a meeting every week to set prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
