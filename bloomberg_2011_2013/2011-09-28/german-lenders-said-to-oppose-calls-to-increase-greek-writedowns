German banks are resisting
political pressure for them to accept larger writedowns on their
holdings of Greek government debt as European policy makers
struggle to avert a default, a person briefed on the talks said.  German lawmakers have called on lenders in recent days to
accept a larger writedown than the 21 percent proposed by the
 Institute of International Finance , an industry lobby group,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. Banks are concerned the IIF agreement may unravel
if they are forced to accept further losses, the person said.  The IIF proposed in July that banks participate in a bond
exchange and debt buyback program under which they would accept
voluntary losses on the debt. Greece now needs creditors to
write down the debt by at least 50 percent, former European
Central Bank Chief Economist  Otmar Issing  said in an interview
with Stern magazine distributed by the OTS news service today.  “It is not feasible to reopen the agreement,”  Josef Ackermann , chairman of the IIF and chief executive officer of
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , said in a Sept. 25 speech to the Washington-
based lobby group. “We should focus now on its timely and
resolute implementation.”  Germany ’s biggest lenders and insurers had about 17.5
billion euros ($24 billion) of exposure to Greek government debt
at the end of June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
