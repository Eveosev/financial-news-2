Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd., the
hedge fund that failed in an effort this year to push for a sale
of  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) , cut its stake in the Swiss drugmaker to less
than 3 percent, according to a stock exchange filing.  Elliott owned more than 6 percent at the time of Actelion’s
annual meeting in May, when shareholders rejected the fund’s
proposal to oust board members. They also decided against an
investigation of whether Actelion had received expressions of
interest from potential buyers.  Actelion shares have plunged 35 percent since the annual
meeting as speculation evaporated about a possible sale of the
Allschwil, Switzerland-based company. The Bloomberg Europe
Pharmaceutical Index slipped 0.3 percent in the period.  Elliott, part of a New York-based hedge fund founded by
 Paul Singer , questioned Actelion’s track record in  drug
development  and said the company should consider options
including a sale. Actelion said the drugmaker will be a
“completely different company” after clinical data on a
successor to its best-selling Tracleer lung medicine become
available.  A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment on the stake
sale in a telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
