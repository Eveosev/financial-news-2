CSL Ltd. (CSL) , the world’s second-
biggest maker of blood-derived therapies, says many of the
concerns raised in audits conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in 2010 and 2011 have been addressed.  “These aren’t new issues,” spokeswoman Sharon McHale said
today after the Australian newspaper published a story saying
the FDA raised concerns about CSL’s manufacturing practices.
“These are routine inspections the FDA does, and aren’t a final
determination of compliance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
