Ethanol futures fell for the first
time this week on concern the European debt crisis will hamper
demand for fuel.  Futures dropped after President  Barack Obama  said the
response by European governments to the debt crisis on the
continent hasn’t been adequate. Commodities such as gasoline,
corn and crude oil declined.  “Global markets sold off today with commodities leading
the way,” SCB & Associates LLC in  Chicago  wrote in a note to
its clients.  Denatured ethanol for October delivery plummeted 4.3 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $2.534 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest decline since Sept. 22. Futures, down 13
percent in September, are headed for its largest monthly drop
since October 2008 and consecutive quarterly losses.  In cash market trading ethanol in Chicago decreased 5
cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.575 a gallon and on the West Coast
the biofuel fell 3.5 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.735, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slid 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$2.605 a gallon and in  New York  the additive dropped 1.5 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $2.715.  Crude oil for November delivery declined $3.24 to settle at
$81.21 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Gasoline for October delivery fell 4.48 cents, or 1.7
percent, to settle at $2.6507 a gallon in New York. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn futures for December delivery tumbled 21.5 cents, or
3.3 percent, to $6.3075 a bushel. Earlier, the grain touched
$6.2875, the lowest since July 12. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
