Mexico  has flexibility in crafting
a response to volatility in international markets, central bank
Governor Agustin Carstens said.  “Today we enjoy, as few central banks in the world, a wide
margin for maneuvering in monetary policy to respond to
turbulence in international markets without putting at risk the
goal of  price stability ,” Carstens said, according to a
presentation attributed to him and posted on the central bank’s
website today.  While a recession can be avoided in the “best case
scenario,” many countries “will not be able to avoid hard
times and prolonged periods of low economic growth,” Carstens
said.  The U.S. and  Europe  are particularly vulnerable, he said.  Mexico’s economy grew 3.74 percent in July from a year
earlier, the national statistics agency said today on its
website.  Mexico’s economic growth is slowing this year from 5.4
percent in 2010 as a global economic slowdown reduces sales to
the U.S. The central bank, which on Aug. 10 cut this year’s
forecast for growth to 3.8 percent to 4.8 percent from 4 percent
to 5 percent, said last month it would consider cutting  interest
rates  if the economic outlook worsened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
