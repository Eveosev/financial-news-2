Miles Templeman, stepping down as
director general of Britain’s  Institute of Directors  after seven
years, said politicians of all parties had let businesses down.  “I believe this government does have a clear business
orientation,” Templeman said in an e-mailed statement today.
“However, it has been very disappointing that successive
governments have too often failed to turn their pro-business
rhetoric into a comprehensive pro-business policy.”  The head of the London-based lobby group cited employment
regulation as an area where the government is putting too many
burdens on business. He also attacked Business Secretary Vince Cable’s attempts to cut the burden of rules on companies.
“Hardly anyone in business really believes that regulation
reduction measures like ‘one in, one out’ and the ‘red tape
challenge’ are working,” he said.  The Business Department today published the latest set of
regulations it has abolished. The rules declared defunct include
those specifying where “no smoking” signs have to be placed in
restaurants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
