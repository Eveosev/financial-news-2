U.S. soybean futures are trading at
a “fair” price based on production and consumption data,
according to Faik Genc, the managing director of Istanbul-based
oilseed broker  AgriPro Ltd .  “The current Chicago levels are fair to me, based on the
supply and demand situation,” Genc said at the MENA Grains
Summit in Istanbul yesterday.  Soybean futures dropped 10 percent this year on the Chicago
Board of Trade to $12.5875 a bushel as commodities slumped on
concern slower growth will curb demand for commodities. The
oilseed is still 13 percent higher than a year ago.  Demand for soybeans, which are crushed to make cooking oil
and meal for  animal feed , will outpace production in 2011-12,
cutting global stocks to 62.5 million metric tons from 68.8
million tons, the U.S. Department of Agriculture  forecasts .  “U.S. soybeans, after the harvest, they should go up
slightly,” Genc said. “Once the funds are back, once the
speculation starts, it will go up again.”  Soybean consumption in  Turkey  and the  Middle East  is
expected to strengthen in the next several years, Genc said.  “Soybean crushing will become bigger and bigger in the
Middle East and North Africa,” Genc said. “Production is very
low in these countries because of climate, desert land.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
