Gasoline futures slipped, joining a
broad selloff in equities and commodities, on concern that
European officials can’t contain region’s debt crisis and as
U.S. stockpiles rose to an eight-week high.  Futures fell as the Energy Department reported that
stockpiles rose 791,000 barrels to 214.9 million. President
 Barack Obama  said Europeans haven’t dealt with their banking
system and their financial system as effectively as they needed
to. The S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials lost 2.5 percent at 3
p.m. in  New York  and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1
percent.  “It’s another late-day commodity selloff, another selloff
in equities,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in New York. “I don’t think there’s too much
confidence in what they’re trying to put together in the
Eurozone. Nothing is clear at all.”  Gasoline for October delivery fell 4.48 cents, or 1.7
percent, to settle at $2.6507 a gallon. on the  New York

bigger writedowns on banks holdings of Greek government debt
than those agreed at a July 21 summit, a European official said.  European Uncertainty  “There’s uncertainty about  Europe  and concern that demand
has really come to a standstill,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Prices touched $2.7063 earlier after the European Union
toughened enforcement of rules to control budget deficits.  Gasoline demand, or deliveries to wholesalers, increased
1.2 percent in the period ended Sept. 23 to an average 8.96
million barrels a day, the most in four weeks. On a four-week
average, consumption was 2.4 percent below a year earlier.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  began idling its refinery in Trainer,
 Pennsylvania , citing product imports and lower motor-fuel
demand. The plant will shut permanently in six months if Conoco
can’t find a buyer.  “There’s probably still a little bit of excess supply,”
said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc
in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “But it will even out. Refiners
will start closing units for maintenance and supply and demand
are reconciling.”  Heating Oil  October-delivery heating oil fell 5.82 cents, or 2 percent,
to $2.8184 a gallon on the exchange. Futures have lost 8.4
