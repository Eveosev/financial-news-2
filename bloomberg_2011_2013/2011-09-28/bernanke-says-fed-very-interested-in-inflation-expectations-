Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank is “very interested in inflation
expectations,” which tend to influence actual price movements.  Inflation expectations now are “broadly consistent with 2

after a speech today in  Cleveland .  “If inflation falls too low, that’s something we have to
respond to,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
