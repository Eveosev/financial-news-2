SPCG Plc, a Thai solar farm
developer, plans to sell 60 million new shares and seek loans to
fund its expansion, President Wandee Khunchornyakong said.  The company aims to build a total of 34 solar projects,
with a combined capacity of more than 200 megawatts, Wandee told
reporters today. It now operates five projects with a combined
capacity of 30 megawatts, while a further nine projects are
scheduled to start operations in the first quarter of next year,
Wandee said.  SPCG hired Kasikorn Securities Co. as a financial adviser
for the share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
