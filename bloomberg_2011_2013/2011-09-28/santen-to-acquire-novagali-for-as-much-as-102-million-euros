     (Corrects to show company’s plan for acquisition procedures
in third paragraph.)  Santen Pharmaceutical Co. plans to
acquire  France ’s  Novagali Pharma SA (NOVA)  for as much as 102 million
euros ($139 million).  The Japanese drugmaker agreed to acquire 50.55 percent of
Novagali from its existing shareholders, according to a
statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. Santen will also
launch a tender offer of 6.15 euros for each Novagali share for
the rest of the holdings.  If Santen acquires at least 95 percent of Novagali, the
drugmaker will increase the amount paid to 6.25 euros a share,
the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
