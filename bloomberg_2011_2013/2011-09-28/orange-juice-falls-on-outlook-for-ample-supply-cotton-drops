Orange-juice  futures fell for the
fifth time in six sessions on signs that supplies will remain
ample as crops increase in  Brazil , the world’s leading grower,
and Florida, the second-biggest. Cotton also dropped.  Orange output this year in Brazil’s Sao Paulo state, the
largest growing region, will rise 17 percent to 377.1 million
boxes from a year earlier, the government said on Sept. 1.
Florida’s production will increase 2.2 percent this season to
142 million boxes, Elizabeth Steger, an independent forecaster,
said last month. A box weighs 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.  “The pressure is coming from the weak economy in  Europe ,
the main buyer of Brazil’s oranges, which may leave some of that
bigger supply available for the U.S. market,” Judy Ganes-Chase,
the president of J. Ganes Consulting in Katonah,  New York , said
in a telephone interview.  Orange juice for November delivery fell 0.8 cent, or 0.5
percent, to $1.5065 a pound at 12:38 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Before today, the price declined 7.4 percent this
year.  Cotton futures for December delivery dropped 0.36 cent, or
0.4 percent, to 99.79 cents a pound in New York. Before today,
the price tumbled 54 percent from a record $2.197 on March 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
