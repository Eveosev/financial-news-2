Australian sales of newly built
dwellings rebounded 1.1 percent in August after two consecutive
monthly declines, the Canberra-based Housing Industry
Association said in a report released today.  Detached house sales increased by 1.5 percent and
apartments slid by 2.2 percent last month, it showed.  The
August rise in newly built dwellings followed declines in June
and July of more than 8 percent.  “There is unwillingness on the part of households to
commit given the uncertain domestic and global economic
conditions which currently prevail,” said  Harley Dale , HIA
chief economist, in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
