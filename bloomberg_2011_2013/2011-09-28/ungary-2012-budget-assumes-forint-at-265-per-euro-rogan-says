Hungary’s 2012 budget draft is
based on a forint exchange rate of about 265 per euro while
providing for a rate of as much as 280 forint or weaker, said
Antal Rogan, a lawmaker from the ruling Fidesz party.  “We think that an exchange rate of about 265 may be
realistic, that’s approximately what we based the budget on,”
Rogan, who is the head of parliament’s Economy Committee, told
state-run  M1  television late yesterday. “But we are also
preparing for the event that it will be 280 or more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
