The  Philippines ’ plan to boost
spending may have a “stimulus effect” as the government tries
to shield the nation from global uncertainty, Economic Planning
Secretary Cayetano Paderanga told reporters today.  “Catch-up spending means that on a month-to-month basis,
you’ll spend more than what you actually planned,” Paderanga
said. President  Benigno Aquino  had instructed his economic
managers to prepare measures to cope with a global downturn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
