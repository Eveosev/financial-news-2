The  New York Mets  declined a
$250,000 offer from the Yankees to temporarily relocate their
Triple-A affiliate next year while its stadium is renovated.  The Yankees wanted the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees to
play at the Eagles & Bears Riverfront Stadium in  Newark , New
Jersey, next year, Yankees’ Chief Operating Officer Lonn Trost
confirmed in an e-mail last night.  Under Major League Baseball rules, the Yankees need
permission from the Mets to move one of their teams into New
Jersey, where the organizations share territorial rights.  “I went there, I reviewed the place, a request was made,”
Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman told MLB.com. “They have
territorial rights that they have a right to invoke. There’s
nothing more to it.”  The Yankees have a history in the  New Jersey  city where
their minor-league team, the Newark Bears, played from 1932 to
1949, prepping players such as  Yogi Berra .  “Newark would be the perfect venue for the Yankees’
Triple-A affiliate,” Newark Mayor Cory Booker said in an e-
mail. “We’re hopeful that the Mets will reconsider their
decision to veto this temporary move.”  The Yankees told the Mets they could temporarily relocate
one of their clubs to the area in the future, Trost confirmed.
The Mets, however, wanted permanent rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
