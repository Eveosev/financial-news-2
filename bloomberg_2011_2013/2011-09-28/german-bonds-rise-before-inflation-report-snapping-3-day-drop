German 10-year bonds rose, snapping
a three-day decline, before a report that economists said will
show the nation’s consumer prices dropped in September.  Two-year notes, perceived to be among  Europe ’s safest
securities, gained for the first time in three days after Bild
reported that  Germany ’s government privately anticipates a
default by  Greece  as early as this year.  The 10-year bund yield dropped three basis points to 1.93
percent at 7:19 a.m. in London. The yield has climbed from a
record low 1.636 percent on Sept. 23. The 2.25 percent security
due September 2021 gained 0.285, or 2.85 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,358) face amount, to 102.860. Two-year yields fell one basis
point to 0.52 percent.  Futures on the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.1
percent.  German consumer prices declined 0.1 percent from August,
when they were unchanged, the Federal Statistics Office will say
today, according to the median estimate of 29 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Bunds and securities of other so-called core countries
gained this month as reports signaled the region’s economy is
slipping back into a recession and the sovereign-debt crisis
worsened. Bunds have gained 2 percent this month, according to
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
