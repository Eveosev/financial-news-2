Kathleen Gaffney, co-manager of the
$19.4 billion Loomis Sayles Bond Fund, said she continues to
hold Greek debt and is buying sovereign debt from other European
countries.  The European Union has “too much to lose” if  Greece  were
to exit the euro, Gaffney said today in an interview with Lisa
Murphy on Bloomberg Television’s “Fast Forward.”  A delegation from the European Commission, the  European
Central Bank  and  International Monetary Fund  will return to
Athens tomorrow as officials race to put in place a package of
measures aimed at containing the sovereign-debt crisis. The
European Commission is resisting a push to impose bigger
writedowns on banks’ holdings of Greek government debt than
those agreed to at a July 21 summit, a European official said.  Gaffney, co-manager of the fund with Daniel Fuss at Boston-
based Loomis Sayles & Co., said she is focused on longer-dated
maturities of Greek bonds.  The Loomis Sayles Bond Fund has returned 4.8 percent in the
past year, beating 85 percent of rivals, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It trails 67 percent of competitors this
year after returning 2.4 percent through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
