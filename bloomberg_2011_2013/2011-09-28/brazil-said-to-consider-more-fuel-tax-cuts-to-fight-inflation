Brazil ’s government may further
cut a tax on fuels as it seeks to offset the impact of a weaker
real on planned imports of ethanol, a government official who
works at the Presidential Palace said.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is assessing the
impact of the weaker real on foreign purchases of ethanol to
decide whether it needs to further reduce the so-called Cide
tax, said the official, who asked not to be named because the
discussions aren’t public.  Brazil decided to cut the ethanol mix in gasoline to 20
percent from 25 percent by Oct. 1 as part of the drive to keep
fuel prices under control. Yesterday it reduced the Cide tax by
16 percent to offset an increase in import costs of gasoline
that could either squeeze  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ’s profit
margins or lead to price increases.  The government planned to import up to 1 billion liters of
ethanol to boost supply after cold weather damaged sugar cane
crops, the  Agriculture Ministry ’s Agroenergy Secretary Manoel
Bertone said Aug. 30. It may reduce imports as a 13 percent drop
in the real against the dollar this month increases the cost of
foreign purchases, the person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
