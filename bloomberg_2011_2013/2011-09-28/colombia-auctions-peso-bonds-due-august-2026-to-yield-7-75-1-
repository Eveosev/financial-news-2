Colombia  sold peso bonds due August
2026 to yield 7.75 percent at a government auction of fixed-rate
securities today, according to the Finance Ministry.  Colombia first issued the securities due 2026 last week to
yield 7.56 percent, as part of a debt swap where it repurchased
6.4 trillion pesos ($3.3 billion) of debt due between 2012 and
2014 and offered in return debt due October 2015, October 2018
and the 2026 bonds.  In todayâ€™s auction, Colombia also sold bonds due October
2018 to yield 6.97 percent, up from 6.87 percent at the last
auction on Aug. 24, while the yield on the October 2015
securities rose to 6.27 percent from 6.21 percent, the  Finance
Ministry  said in a statement.  Investor demand for the fixed-rate securities totaled 883
billion pesos, almost three times the 300 billion pesos of debt
offered, the ministry said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
