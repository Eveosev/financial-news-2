Thailand ’s baht fell on concern a
slowing U.S. recovery and  Europe ’s debt crisis will damp demand
for exports from Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy.  The  finance ministry  cut its growth forecast for this year
to a maximum 4.3 percent from a June estimate of up to 5 percent,
it said today. The currency gained 0.2 percent earlier after
stock exchange and the Thai Bond Market Association data showed
global funds bought $19 million more Thai stocks and $40 million
more government bonds than they sold yesterday.  “The weaker trend for the emerging markets is lingering,”
said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian and emerging-
markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo . “There is
no fundamental solution to Europe’s debt crisis.”  The baht dropped 0.4 percent to 31.01 per dollar as of 3:08
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  It
touched 31.22 yesterday, its weakest level since Sept. 8, 2010.
The currency has declined 3.4 percent in September and 0.9
percent this quarter.  The baht may average 30.50 per dollar this year and 30 per
dollar next year, said Boonchai Charassaengsomboon, director of
the finance ministry’s macroeconomic policy bureau.  Government data released Sept. 22 showed growth in overseas
shipments slowed to 31 percent in August from a year earlier
after having increased 38 percent in July. Overseas sales
account for about two-thirds of the economy.  Government bonds  gained. The yield on the 5.25 percent
notes due May 2014 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 3.54 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
