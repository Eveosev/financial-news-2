Ukrainian farmers may lose a 10th
of the wheat they’ve sown as drought afflicts large parts of the
country, according to the national Hydrometeorology Center.  “At least 10 percent of wheat that has already been
planted is going to be lost,” Tetiana Adamenko, head of the
agricultural department at the center, said today by phone in
the capital, Kiev. About 70 percent of Ukraine is in drought,
she added. The affected areas will probably be planted with corn
and sunflowers in the spring, Adamanko said.  Wheat and rapeseed are sprouting “very poorly,” Adamenko
said. Rains that may fall before Oct. 5 will most likely be
insufficient for robust growth of plants, she said. While
rainfall after Oct. 5 will help winter grains to sprout, the
plants will require warm weather in November to strengthen
sufficiently for winter, according to the weather center.  Ukraine was hit by drought last year, prompting the
government to impose quotas on outbound grain shipments from
October to June. The restrictions were replaced with export
duties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
