Irish retail sales fell for a
second month in August as jobless claims increased and a housing
slump continued, the country’s central statistics office said.  Retail sales fell 0.4 percent from the previous month, when
they dropped 1.5 percent, the Cork-based statistics office said
in a statement today. From a year earlier, sales declined 3.6
percent in August. Excluding autos, retail sales dropped 0.5
percent on the month and 3.7 percent on the year.  Irish consumers are being squeezed as the government raises
taxes and cuts government workers’ wages to reduce the  budget
deficit . The  unemployment rate  rose to 14.4 percent in August
and  home prices  fell, extending a slump that began in 2007,
separate reports this month showed.  “Until consumers have a clear line of sight regarding
their household finances and feel better about their employment
prospects they will remain reluctant to spend,” Torlach
Denihan, director of lobby group Retail Ireland, said in a
statement. “The crux is the lack of  consumer confidence . The
budget in December will have an enormous impact.”  Sales of books, newspapers and stationery fell 13.3 percent
in August from a year earlier, the statistics office said, while
sales of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals fell 10.4 percent. Sales
at department stores slipped 3.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
