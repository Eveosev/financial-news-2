The lira pared gains against the
dollar after the Turkish central bank reduced the amount of
foreign exchange it plans to sell today to $100 million from
$280 million yesterday.  The lira appreciated as much as 0.3 percent today and
erased its gain to trade little changed at 1.8487 per dollar at
11:27 a.m. in Istanbul.  The central bank’s $280 million sale for lira yesterday was
the second-biggest amount since it began the auctions on Aug. 5
to shore up the lira, the world’s worst-performing emerging
market currency this year.  The bank “is playing too much with the sale figures and
this is irking the market,” Eren Yardimci, a currency trader at
UBS AG in Zurich, said in response to e-mailed questions.  “The euro-dollar basket has hardly changed today compared
to yesterday and for that reason the market was expecting a
figure around $200 million,” Yardimci said.  The lira has depreciated 16 percent against the dollar this
year, as a widening current-account deficit and worsening debt
crisis in  Europe  hurt investor confidence in the country’s
financial stability.  Yields on the two-year benchmark bond rose 2 basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.45 percent, according to the RBS
Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
