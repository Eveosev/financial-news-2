The European Union is said to be
planning to raise a further 1.1 billion euros ($1.5 billion)
from bond investors to fund bailouts of Ireland and  Portugal ,
less than a week after it sold 4 billion euros of debt.  The seven-year notes are being sold through the  European
Financial Stabilisation Mechanism , one of the EU’s two bailout
funds, according to a banker involved in the transaction. The
EFSM raised 4 billion euros from a sale of 15-year securities on
Sept. 22 and a further 5 billion euros from a sale of 10-year
bonds on Sept. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The EFSM is run by the European Commission, the EU’s 27-
nation executive arm while the second rescue fund, the European
Financial Stability Facility, is overseen by euro area nations.
The EFSM has already raised 26.9 billion euros from bonds this
year to fund the rescues of Portugal and Ireland. This latest
sale comes as officials race to put in place a package of
measures that will ring-fence  Greece .  To contact the reporter on this story:
