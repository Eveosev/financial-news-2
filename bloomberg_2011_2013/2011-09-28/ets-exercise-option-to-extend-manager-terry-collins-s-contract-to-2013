The  New York Mets  exercised an
option to extend manager Terry Collins’s contract for 2013,
General Manager  Sandy Alderson  said.  Collins, 62, has led the team to a 76-85 record with one
game left in the regular season of his first year as Mets
manager. He signed a two-year contract with the Major League
Baseball team on Nov. 23, 2010.  “He has developed strong relationships with our players
and the club’s resiliency is a testament to Terry’s approach,”
Alderson said in a statement. “We are confident Terry is the
right man for the job as we build a winning and contending team
for the future.”  The Mets lost their third straight game last night, 5-4 to
the  Cincinnati Reds  in 13 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
