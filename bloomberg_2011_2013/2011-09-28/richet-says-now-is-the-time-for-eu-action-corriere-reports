European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said “now is the time” for euro-area
governments to act to tackle the single-currency area’s debt
crisis,  Corriere della Sera  reported, citing an interview.  Trichet said “effective action, implementation, verbal
discipline and a stronger team spirit on the part of the
European executive branches,” are needed, the newspaper
reported.  The Frankfurt-based ECB is “never pre-committed” on
 interest rates , and non-standard measures need to be “exactly
commensurate” to the level of tension in financial markets,
Trichet was quoted by the newspaper as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
