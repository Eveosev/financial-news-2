More than 6,000 Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails started a hunger strike and campaign
of disobedience today to protest against their treatment, a
Palestinian official said.  The action will include refusal to wear uniforms or obey
the instructions of prison authorities, Eassa Qaraqea, minister
of prisoner affairs in the Palestinian National Authority
Cabinet, told Voice of  Palestine  radio. The prisoners “have the
right to protest against the inhuman measures practiced against
them,” he said.  Palestinians demand the release of all prisoners as part of
a permanent peace agreement with Israel. Israel says prisoners
who were involved in the killing of Israelis cannot be freed.  The U.S. and its allies are pushing for the resumption of
talks between the sides which broke down last year, to forestall
a vote at the  United Nations  on Palestinian statehood.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas presented the
demand at the UN General Assembly last week. Israel and the U.S.
say statehood must be achieved via a peace agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
