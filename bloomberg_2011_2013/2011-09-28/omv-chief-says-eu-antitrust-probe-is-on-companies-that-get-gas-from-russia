OMV AG (OMV)  said that the companies that
are being investigated by European Union regulators looking for
possible antitrust violations in central and eastern  Europe  get
natural gas from  Russia .  “There are investigations by the EU competition autority
regarding natural gas,” OMV Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Roiss told reporters in Fuschl am See in  Austria  today.
“Companies that get gas from Russia are being investigated.”  The European Commission said yesterday that it raided
companies that may have broken antitrust rules or have
information about behavior that excluded rivals by dividing
markets, hindering access to networks, harming efforts to widen
supply sources or overcharging. It didn’t name the companies it
visited or the 10 countries where their offices are located.  OMV said yesterday that it was among the companies that
were raided and that it is cooperating fully with the
authorities.  “We are a very transparent company,” Roiss said. “We are
cooperating with the competition autority.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
