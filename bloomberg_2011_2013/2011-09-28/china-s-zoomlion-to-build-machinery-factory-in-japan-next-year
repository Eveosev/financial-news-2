Changsha Zoomlion Heavy Industry
Science and Technology Development Co.,  China ’s second-biggest
construction machinery maker, plans to build a factory in  Japan 
next year as it seeks to expand overseas.  Zoomlion may set up the facility on its own or form a local
venture, the Changsha, Hunan province-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today, without disclosing planned
investments. The equipment maker also won a contract to sell 30
truck-mounted concrete pumps to a customer in Japan.  The deal is China’s first large order for construction
machinery from Japan, Zoomlion said without disclosing the
value. The average price of the equipment is $300,000 apiece,
spokeswoman Chen Yingzi said.  “Japan’s recognition of China’s capability in machinery
manufacturing” is reflected in the order, Zoomlion said in the
statement.  The company said it will also seek overseas acquisitions.
Rivals Sany Heavy Industry Co. and XCMG Construction Machinery
Co. are also expanding outside China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
