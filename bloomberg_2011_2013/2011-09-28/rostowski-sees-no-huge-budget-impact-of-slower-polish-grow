The impact on Polish public
finances wouldn’t be “huge” if economic growth slowed by as
much as 0.5 percentage points from the government’s 4 percent
forecast for next year, Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said
today in Warsaw.  He said faster-than-forecast inflation and economic growth
in 2011 would increase nominal gross domestic product and the
tax base, offsetting any “slight” growth slowdown in 2012.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
