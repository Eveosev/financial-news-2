Fergo Aisa SA (AISA) , a Spanish real
estate company, said CatalunyaCaixa and the company are willing
to reach an agreement on a debt dispute after the lender sought
a court order to make Fergo Aisa file for bankruptcy.  A court order on Sept. 16 that would have pushed the
company to start bankruptcy proceedings has been suspended, the
company said in a regulatory filing today. They have until Sept.
30 to reach an agreement, the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
