Owens-Illinois, Inc., the world’s
largest maker of glass containers, filed for international
arbitration with the World Bank’s International Center for
Settlement Disputes for compensation for two bottling plants
nationalized by President  Hugo Chavez ’s government in October
2010.  Owens-Illinois filed through its Dutch subsidiary, OI
European Group B.V., in order to seek compensation under a
bilateral investment treaty between the Netherlands and
 Venezuela , company spokeswoman Stephanie Johnston said today in
an e-mailed statement.  Chavez last year ordered a government takeover of the local
unit of the U.S.-owned glass manufacturer, alleging that the
company exploited workers and damaged the environment.  Venezuela now has 18 arbitration cases pending in the
ICSID, as the court is known. Carlos Escarra, the country’s
prosecutor general, on Sept. 21 said that state oil company
Petroleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA, and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
were negotiating an arbitration settlement of around $6 billion
for assets seized in 2007. PDVSA said later the same day it
isn’t negotiating directly with Exxon.  Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP)  said it filed a lawsuit Sept. 23
against Venezuela and PDVSA alleging that the country seized 11
drilling rigs on June 29, 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
