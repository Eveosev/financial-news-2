Thirty-year bonds, the best-
performing U.S. government debt this month, will draw buyers as
yields rise to 3.41 percent, Daiwa Asset Management Co. said.  “It will be strong resistance,” said Tsutomu Komiya, who
helps oversee the equivalent of $120.9 billion as an investor at
Daiwa Asset in  Tokyo .  A Fibonacci graph shows the level is a 61.8 percent
retracement of a surge in yields from a record low of 2.51
percent in December 2008 to a peak of 4.86 percent in April 2010.
Rates touched 2.74 percent on Sept. 23, the lowest since January
2009.  Yields fell a basis point to 3.06 percent today as of 8:40
a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
3.75 percent security due in August 2041 rose 3/32, or 94 cents
per $1,000 face amount, to 113 11/32.  Thirty-year Treasuries have returned 9.4 percent this month,
according, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. Ten-year
notes gained 2 percent and two-year securities were little
changed, based on prices and interest payments, the figures show.  Fibonacci  analysis is based on a series of numbers
developed by 13th-century mathematician Leonardo da Pisa, known
as Fibonacci, who was studying growth rates. Analysts use the
numbers to determine levels where buy and sell orders may be set.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
