The  New York Jets  re-signed
linebacker Aaron Maybin, who was released before the start of
the regular season.  Maybin, a first-round pick in the 2009 National Football
League draft, joined the Jets in the preseason after being cut
by the  Buffalo Bills . A pass-rushing specialist, Maybin failed
to record a sack in two seasons with the Bills.  The addition of Maybin comes after the Jets’ defense
allowed 234 rushing yards and four touchdowns in last week’s 34-
24 loss to the  Oakland Raiders .  The Jets had two roster spots open yesterday after placing
center Robert Turner and tight end Jeff Cumberland on season-
ending injured reserve. The team promoted Jeff Baker, a rookie
fullback and tight end, from their practice squad to fill one
spot before re-signing Maybin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
