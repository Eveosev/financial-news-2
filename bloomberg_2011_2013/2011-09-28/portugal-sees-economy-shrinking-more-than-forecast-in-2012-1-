The Portuguese economy may shrink
more than projected in 2012 because of slower external demand,
the government said.  The revision is “strictly” due to “external reasons,”
Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said in parliament today,
citing a “softening of external demand.” The government will
revise its forecast to a contraction of between 2.2 percent to
2.3 percent from its previous forecast of 1.8 percent, he said.
The new forecast will be included in the 2012 budget proposal to
be presented next month.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its projection for
global growth on Sept. 20 and predicted “severe” repercussions
if Europe fails to contain its debt crisis or U.S. policy makers
remain deadlocked over a fiscal plan. European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  said today that forecasts point to a
“strong slowdown” of the European economy.  The government still expects the economy to return to
growth in 2013, Passos Coelho said.  Portugal  followed Greece and Ireland in April in seeking a
bailout. Like his Irish and Greek counterparts, Passos Coelho is
cutting spending and raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78
billion-euro ($106 billion) aid plan from the European Union and
the IMF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
