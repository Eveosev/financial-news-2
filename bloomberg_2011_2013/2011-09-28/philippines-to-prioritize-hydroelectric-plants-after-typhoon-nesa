The  Philippines  will give
“priority dispatch” to hydroelectric power plants to bring
down water levels of dams following Typhoon Nesat, Energy
Secretary Rene Almendras said in a speech today.  Almendras said he signed a circular declaring an
“emergency state in power” following the storm that also
toppled  power lines  and left most of the capital and nearby
provinces without electricity yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
