Aer Lingus (AERL)  Group Plc plans to join
a trans-Atlantic airline venture in the next few years after
scrapping plans to become a member of a  global alliance , Chief
Executive Officer Christoph Mueller said in an interview.  The Irish carrier decided against alliance membership in
August because of the cost, and regards one of three antitrust-
immune trans-Atlantic pacts involving British Airways,  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group as offering better value,
Mueller said in  London , adding that it aims to enlist by 2013.  Bilateral accords in which Aer Lingus would fly connecting
traffic to the hubs of partners are also being pursued, he said
while declining to disclose details.  Aer Lingus doesn’t need investment from a larger carrier to
ensure its survival, the CEO said. The Irish government has said
it may auction a 25 percent stake in the carrier next year to
pay down debt, while  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  has said it could sell
its 29 percent of stock after being thwarted by regulators in
successive attempts at a full takeover.  “We have the financial strength to keep our
independence,” Mueller said. “Do we need a big brother coming
in, a trade investor? Definitely not.”  Aer Lingus has break-up value 1.27 billion euros, the CEO
said, and a market capitalization of 342 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
