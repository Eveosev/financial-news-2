The U.S. hog-breeding herd on
Sept. 1 was 0.6 percent bigger than a year earlier, as
profitability prospects encouraged producers to expand.  About 5.806 million sows were being held back for
breeding as the month began, up from 5.77 million on Sept. 1,
2010, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
quarterly report. Nine analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
forecast a 0.1 percent increase, on average. The breeding herd
was little changed from 5.803 million at the end of the
previous quarter.  Producers made an average profit of $15 for each animal
sold from June through August, said  Rich Nelson , the director
of research at McHenry, Illinois-based Allendale Inc. In the
year-earlier period, the figure was $28, he said.  Wholesale pork prices, up 25 percent this year, reached
$1.1019 a pound on Aug. 8, the highest since at least October
1997, USDA data show.  Retail  pork averaged $3.512 a pound in
August, a record high, and spot-market hogs reached $1.0408 a
pound on Aug. 4, the highest since at least April 2003,
government data show.  “Record hog and pork prices encouraged farmers to
maintain their breeding herds at relatively high levels,”  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught Futures Insights in Altus,
 Arkansas , said in an e-mail before the report.  The total hog herd was 1 percent bigger on Sept. 1 at
66.599 million, compared with 65.971 million a year earlier,
the USDA said. Analysts expected a 0.7 percent gain.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.125 cent to
83.35 cents a pound at 12:51 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The USDA released its report after markets closed in
Chicago.  The inventory of hogs to be sold for slaughter was 60.793
million, up 1 percent from 60.201 million a year earlier, the
USDA said. Analysts expected a 0.7 percent increase.  Sows averaged a record 10.03 pigs per litter during the
three months ended Aug. 31, up from 9.81 in the same period a
year earlier, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
