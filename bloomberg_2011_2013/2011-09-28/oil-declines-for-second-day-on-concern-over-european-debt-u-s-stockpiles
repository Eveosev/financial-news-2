Oil in  New York  headed for its
biggest quarterly drop since 2008 as investors speculated that
global economic growth will slow and curb fuel demand amid
rising supplies.  West Texas Intermediate futures, down 15 percent since June
30, were little changed today. Crude stockpiles rose 1.92
million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Department said.
Morgan Stanley cut its Brent oil forecast to $100 from $130 on
weaker demand and increasing OPEC production. A Bloomberg poll
indicated Chinese growth is poised to ease.  “We’re trading from headline to headline and that’s all
markets, not just the oil market,” said  Michael McCarthy , a
chief market strategist at CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty Ltd. in
Sydney. “The gap is closing between Brent and West Texas and
that could be an indication that there is some easing in the
supply-side concerns from the  Middle East .”  Crude for November delivery was at $81.15 a barrel, down 6
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 2:16 p.m. Sydney time, after falling as much as 1.9 percent.
The contract yesterday slid 3.8 percent to $81.21. Futures are
down 9 percent this month and 11 percent this year. The
quarterly decline is the biggest since the last three months of
2008.  Brent oil for November settlement was at $103.94 a barrel,
up 13 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The European benchmark contract was at a premium of $22.79 to
New York crude, compared with a record of $26.87 on Sept. 6.  Slower Growth  Economic growth in  China , which consumes about a tenth of
the world’s oil, will slow to less than 5 percent annually
within five years, according to most investors in a Bloomberg
Global Poll. Growth was 9.5 percent last quarter.  The European Union accounted for about 16 percent of global
oil demand last year, according BP Plc’s annual Statistical
Review of World Energy. German lawmakers vote today on an
expansion of the euro area’s rescue fund as the region’s
governments weigh further measures to support  Greece .  Crude inventories climbed for for the first time in four
weeks in the U.S., the world’s biggest user of the commodity,
which accounts for about 21 percent of demand. Gasoline
stockpiles rose 791,000 barrels in the week ended Sept. 23, the
Energy Department report showed.  Libya  Output  Production capacity in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will climb almost 800,000 barrels a day in
2012, led by the resumption of Libyan fields, Morgan Stanley
analysts led by New York-based Hussein Allidina said in a report
yesterday. Slowing global economic growth will curb demand, the
analysts said.  Libyan crude production may reach as much as 400,000
barrels a day next month, Citigroup Inc. analysts including
 Edward Morse  said in a note yesterday.  Fighting in Libya since February has reduced the
availability of light, sweet crude, or oil with low density and
sulfur content. The country’s output fell to 45,000 barrels a
day last month, according to Bloomberg estimates, compared with
the 1.6 million barrels a day the nation pumped in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
