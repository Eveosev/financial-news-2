The  European Central Bank  said it
will lend banks 140.6 billion euros ($191.7 billion) for three
months as tensions in money markets persist.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said 214 banks asked for the three-
month funds, which will be lent at the average of its benchmark
 interest rate  over the period of the loan. Currently, the
benchmark stands at 1.5 percent. The ECB fills all bids against
eligible collateral. Banks tomorrow need to repay 132.2 billion
euros in maturing three-month loans.  Financial institutions are wary of lending to each other
after Europe’s sovereign debt crisis fueled concern that some
governments may struggle to refinance their debts, prompting
investors to shun bonds sold by nations including Greece, Italy
and  Spain .  In a separate tender today, the ECB allotted $500 million
to one bidder in a regular seven-day loan. The ECB doesn’t
identify the banks it lends to.  To contact the reporter on this story:
