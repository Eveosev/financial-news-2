European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said the EU has no plan
to force banks to separate their commercial and investment
operations.  “No regulatory initiatives are foreseen in order to
mandate the separation of commercial and  investment banking ,”
Rehn said in a written response to a question from the European
Parliament.  “The commission is taking targeted legislative measures in
order to ensure that all banks have sufficient amounts of
capital, are properly supervised, and -– importantly -– are
allowed to fail without recourse to public money, by putting in
place an EU framework for bank crisis prevention and bank
resolution, applicable to all banks, regardless of the focus of
their activities,” Rehn said in his response, which is dated
Sept. 27.  “The numerous regulatory reform measures currently being
pursued should restore confidence and eventually provide for
greater long-term financial stability,” he said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
