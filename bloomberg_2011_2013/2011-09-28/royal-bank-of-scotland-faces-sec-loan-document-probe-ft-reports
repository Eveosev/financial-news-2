Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, faces U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission scrutiny over demands by investors that
it repurchase some debts, the Financial Times reported.  The inquiry is part of a probe into how financial firms
handled faulty  mortgage loans , the newspaper reported today,
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The
regulator has sought information on “document deficiencies,”
related to remedial measures and early payment defaults, the
London-based bank said in an Aug. 30 regulatory filing.  The SEC is investigating whether banks misled shareholders
about how many loans they might be forced to repurchase because
of early defaults, the Financial Times reported. Regulators are
also investigating whether lenders had enough reserves to fund
repurchases or handle related litigation, according to the
report.  The SEC began an inquiry in October, which was converted
into a formal investigation in January, according to the filing.  Pholida Phengsomphone, a spokeswoman for RBS, declined to
comment. The bank is fully cooperating with the probe, according
to the filling.  John Nester , a spokesman for the SEC, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
