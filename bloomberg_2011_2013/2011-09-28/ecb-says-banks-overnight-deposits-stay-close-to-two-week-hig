The  European Central Bank  said
financial institutions’ overnight deposits stayed close to a
two-week high.  Banks parked 164.1 billion euros ($223.4 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, down from 165.1 billion euros the
previous day. Euro-area banks increased overnight borrowing at
the marginal rate of 2.25 percent to 726 million euros from 711
million euros the previous day.  The ECB currently lends banks unlimited liquidity in its
refinancing operations at the benchmark rate of 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
