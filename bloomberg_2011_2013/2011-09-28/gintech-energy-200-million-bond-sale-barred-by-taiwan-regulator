Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory
Commission rejected  Gintech Energy Corp. (3514) ’s plan to raise funds
through selling up to $200 million of overseas convertible
bonds, because of insufficient disclosure, the financial
regulator said in a statement on its website today.  Gintech said last month its plans to sell bonds to buy
materials from abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
