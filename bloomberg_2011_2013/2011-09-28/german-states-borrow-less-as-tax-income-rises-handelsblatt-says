Germany ’s federal states will
borrow less this year after tax revenue rose amid the country’s
economic recovery,  Handelsblatt  newspaper reported.  States will borrow 10 billion euros ($13.6 billion) to 13
billion euros this year, less than the 24 billion euros
envisaged in budget plans, the newspaper said, citing Finance
Ministry calculations. The deficit halved between January and
August, compared with the same period a year earlier,
Handelsblatt said. At the same time, tax income rose almost 9
percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
