Avusa Ltd. (AVU)  Chief Executive Officer
Prakash Desai quit a week after the chairman and two directors
resigned citing interference by shareholders of the publisher of
 South Africa ’s largest weekend broadsheet newspaper.  Desai, who was CEO for five years and had been with the
company for 13 years, will step down on Oct. 3 with Michael
Robertson, the managing director of media, appointed as acting
CEO, Johannesburg-based Avusa said in a statement today.
Robertson will work with Desai over the next month to “ensure a
smooth transition,” the company said.  Desai’s departure comes after Chairman Dumisa Ntsebeza and
non-executive independent directors Tom Wixley and Babalwa Ngonyama quit the board on Sept. 19. The management of Avusa,
which was the subject of a failed buyout bid from a group led by
private equity firm Capitau Holdings Ltd., has had public
disagreements with shareholder  Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG)  over the
media company’s acquisition last year of Universal Print Group
and Hirt & Carter.  Mvelaphanda, Avusa’s largest shareholder, had opposed the
transaction, citing dilution of its stake, which was 25.5
percent at the time. The deal, a combination of new shares and
cash, was approved by other shareholders, resulting in
Mvelaphanda’s stake dropping to 21.3 percent, according to the
company’s  latest annual report .  Avusa publishes South Africa’s Sunday Times, has a stake in
Business Day, distributes films and sells books.  To contact the reporter on this story:
