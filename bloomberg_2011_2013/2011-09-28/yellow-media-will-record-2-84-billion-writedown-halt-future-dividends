Yellow Media Inc. (YLO) , the Canadian
directories publisher that has lost 95 percent of its value this
year, said it will record a C$2.9 billion ($2.84 billion)
writedown this quarter after reviewing its assets.  Yellow Media will book the non-cash expense in the quarter
ending Sep. 30, and eliminate its dividend after an Oct. 17
payment, the Verdun, Quebec-based company said today in a
statement. As part of an agreement to amend the term of a C$1
billion loan, it will repay C$500 million and reduce the size of
a revolving term loan from C$750 million to C$250 million.  Yellow Media is transitioning to digital media as customers
increasingly search classified listings on smartphones and
tablet computers. The company in July completed the C$708
million sale of its Trader Corp. unit, which publishes about 160
classified advertising magazines in a bid to counter losses from
declining print revenue. It reported a second-quarter loss of
C$14.3 million last month and cut its dividend by 77 percent.  The shares fell 28 cents, or 50 percent, to 29 cents at
1:53 p.m. in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
