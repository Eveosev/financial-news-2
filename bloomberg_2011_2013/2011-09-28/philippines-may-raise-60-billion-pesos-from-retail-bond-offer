The  Philippines  may raise at least
50 billion pesos to 60 billion pesos from the sale of bonds
targeted to individuals by the second or third week of October,
Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola told reporters today.  The government may offer retail bonds due in 10- and 15-
years, Mendiola said after the debt auction. It received
proposals from two groups on the sale of debt targeted to
individuals and will probably select arrangers this week,
Mendiola said. The government’s fourth-quarter auction schedule
won’t be affected by the retail debt offer, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
