German five-year notes declined
after an auction of the securities today received fewer bids
than the amount on offer, as yields at the sale fell to the
lowest on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on five-year notes rose four basis points to 1.25
percent at 10:32 a.m. in  London .  Germany  received bids for 5.1 billion euros ($7 billion) of
the notes maturing in October 2016, less than the maximum
available 6 billion euros of securities, according to the
results from the Bundesbank. It allocated 5 billion euros to
investors at an average yield of 1.22 percent, the lowest rate
since Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
