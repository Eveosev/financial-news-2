Sempra Energy (SRE) , California’s third-
largest utility, received a $337 million U.S. Energy Department
loan guarantee to build a 150-megawatt solar project in Arizona.  Sempra will sell electricity from the Mesquite Solar 1
plant to California’s largest utility, PG&E Corp., under a 20-
year contract, the Energy Department said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The Mesquite project in Maricopa County, about 45 miles (72
kilometers) west of Phoenix, will use 800,000 multicrystalline
silicon solar panels from Wuxi, China-based Suntech Power
Holdings Co., San Diego-based Sempra said in February.  Lawmakers in  Washington  are scrutinizing the Energy
Department’s program in the wake of Solyndra LLC’s Sept. 6
bankruptcy filing. The Fremont, California-based solar-panel
maker received a $527 million loan guarantee.  Southern  California  Edison Co. is the state’s second-
largest utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
