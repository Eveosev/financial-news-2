Experts from the European
Commission,  European Central Bank  and  International Monetary
Fund  will return to  Athens  tomorrow to review the Greek
government’s budget-cut plans, the commission said.  The restart of the review will “constitute an important
step toward achieving the 2012 agreed fiscal target and putting
the Greek public finances on a sustainable footing,” commission
spokesman  Amadeu Altafaj  told reporters in Brussels today.  Euro-area finance ministers will hold an extra meeting in
October to consider  Greece ’s situation, he added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
