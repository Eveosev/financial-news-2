Ralph Fiennes  whips up a storm as a
magician on the London stage.  Fiennes is Prospero in “The Tempest.” His movie-star
profile -- notably as Voldemort in the “Harry Potter” series -
- helped rack up 1 million pounds ($1.56 million) in advance
ticket sales for the Shakespeare play.  Dressed in rags, the actor puts in a solid performance as
the toppled, vindictive duke. Trevor Nunn’s production is
colorful, if slow.  “The Tempest” is at the Theatre Royal Haymarket.

movement, especially in ballet, as a well-documented exhibition
demonstrates. There are sketches of ballerinas seconds before a
pirouette, panning-shot-like views of ballet studios, and
studies from every possible angle of a 14-year-old dancer.  Degas did get his own still camera in 1895. You can see him
use it: Just check the mirror in the photograph he took that
year of Renoir and the poet Stephane Mallarme, who had to hold
the pose for about 15 minutes.  The show could have used a few more oils. Yet there are
fine charcoal sketches, and a room of dizzying pastels so
fragile, they can only be shown for three months. They alone are
worth the trip -- especially because the exhibition won’t
travel.  “Degas and the Ballet: Picturing Movement” ends Dec. 11
at the  Royal Academy , Burlington House, Piccadilly, W1J 0BD.

going through the Duchess of York’s drawers in a 1996 TV show.  Wax also has a dark side that she exposes in her
bittersweet comedy act “Losing It” (which ends Saturday
night). This time, she sneers at herself as she recounts her
experience with mental illness.  The comedienne serves up plenty of her signature barbs, as
when she mocks the British tendency to bury emotion in cups of
tea. She also makes time for an audience Q&A.  “Ruby Wax: Losing It” is at the Duchess Theatre through
Saturday. Information: +44-844-482-9672 or

and actors since 1997. The food is unfussy and reasonable, with
the pretheater menu costing just 18 pounds for three courses.

who became Dame Mitsuko in 2009 -- plays music by a composer
she’s known for on Sunday.  Uchida completes her Beethoven piano concerto cycle at the
Barbican, performing the Concerto No. 3 with the  London  Symphony
Orchestra conducted by Colin Davis. If you can’t do Sunday, she
plays it again on Oct. 4.  The Barbican Centre is on Silk Street, EC2Y 8DS.
Information:  http://www.barbican.org.uk  or +44-20-7638-4141.  Sedap, a Malaysian restaurant near the Barbican, draws
diners from across London. It’s a small, family run
establishment, where the parents cook and the daughters serve.
It’s inexpensive and can get crowded, so book early.
