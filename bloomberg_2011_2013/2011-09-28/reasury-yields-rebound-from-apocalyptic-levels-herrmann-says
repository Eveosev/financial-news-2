U.S. Treasury yields, which had
reached “apocalyptic” levels last week, have pulled back as
European officials have grasped the scope of the sovereign-debt
crisis,  John Herrmann , a senior fixed-income strategist at State
Street Global Markets LLC, said today on Bloomberg Television’s
“In the Loop” with Betty Liu.  Benchmark 10-year note yields advanced two basis points to
1.99 percent after touching 2.01 percent yesterday, the highest
level since Sept. 19. Yields reached 1.6714 percent, the lowest
level in  Federal Reserve  figures going back to 1953, as the
Group of 20 finance chiefs pledged to address rising risks to
the global economy.  “Several steps have been taken that at least convey to the
market that European officials are getting the size of the
problem,” and the message that they need to make bigger steps
not smaller steps, Herrmann said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
