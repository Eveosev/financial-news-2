Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
most-popular search-engine, said it will invest more than $200
million building its first centers in Asia that house Internet
data, accelerating plans to expand in the region.  The U.S. company has acquired land in  Hong Kong ,  Singapore 
and Taiwan to build data centers, it said in an e-mailed
statement today. The facilities in Hong Kong and Taiwan will
cost more than $100 million each, the statement said.  Google is building its first data centers in Asia as users
in countries including China and India access the company’s
services such as search, e-mail and online maps. Google is also
adding users in the region for its Android mobile-phone
operating system, the main competitor to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s wireless
technology.  Google currently leases data centers in Asia to offer
services in the region. The Mountain View, California-based
company currently only operates self-owned data centers in U.S.
states including Oklahoma and North Carolina, in addition to
Finland and Belgium,  according to its website .  Google did not give a timeframe for the operation of the
Asian facilities, saying the centers will come on line one to
two years after construction begins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
