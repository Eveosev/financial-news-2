Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said she’s against a Greek default because it would cost
her country’s taxpayers about 5 billion euros ($6.8 billion),
 Handelsblatt  reported.  Fekter says she supports a long-term aid package for
 Greece , the Duesseldorf-based newspaper reported today.
Investors who speculate against Greece shouldn’t be supported,
