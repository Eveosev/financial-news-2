(Corrects spelling of Leemann in headline)  Eduardo Leemann, chief executive
officer of Zurich-based  Falcon Private Bank Ltd. , comments on
wealth management clients’ top asset holdings and investment
strategies, and recruiting in  China . Leemann spoke in an
interview yesterday in Hong Kong.  Falcon, which manages about $12 billion in assets, was
purchased by Abu Dhabi’s Aabar Investments PJSC from  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)  in December 2008 after the insurer was
forced to sell assets to repay a U.S. government loan that saved
it from bankruptcy. It has branches and representative offices
in Geneva, Dubai, Hong Kong and  Singapore .  On clients’ investment appetite:  “Cash, gold and fixed income are the top three picks of
our clients so far. Some clients may start to tip their toes in
the equity market given the current attractive valuation but, in
my view, the top three picks are unlikely to be changed in the
next 12 months.”  On recruiting in China:  “I’m seeing talent coming out of local banks in China and
global banks in China. They’re leaving as they might not want to
work for a big product factory.  ‘‘We want to focus on Greater China and that includes
China, Taiwan and  Hong Kong .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
