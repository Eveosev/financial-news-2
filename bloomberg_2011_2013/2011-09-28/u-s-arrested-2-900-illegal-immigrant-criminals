The U.S. arrested 2,900 illegal
immigrant criminals over seven days in a nationwide crackdown,
according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  All of those taken into custody had prior criminal
convictions and at least 1,282 had multiple criminal
convictions, ICE said in a  statement  today. More than 1,600 of
those arrested had felony convictions, including manslaughter,
attempted murder and kidnapping.  Suspects were arrested in all 50 states and four U.S.
territories, according to the statement.  The arrests are part of an effort by the Obama
administration to remove from the U.S. illegal immigrant
criminals and “egregious immigration law violators,” according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
