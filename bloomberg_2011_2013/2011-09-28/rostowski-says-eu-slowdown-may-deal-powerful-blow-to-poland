Poland’s economy is strong and
well-prepared for what may be a “powerful blow” from turmoil
in the euro area, Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said today in
parliament during a meeting with Grzegorz Napieralski, leader of
the opposition Democratic  Left Alliance .  Napieralski’s party doesn’t understand the gravity of the
global economic situation, as shown by its criticism of the
finance minister’s Sept. 16 warning that the long-term
consequences of a possible euro-area collapse could include war,
Rostowski said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
