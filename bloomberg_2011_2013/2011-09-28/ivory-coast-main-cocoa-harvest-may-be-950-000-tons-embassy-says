Ivory Coast ’s 2011-12 main cocoa
harvest may be 900,000 metric tons to 950,000 tons, less than
the previous season, according to the French Embassy in the West
African nation.  Racketeering in cocoa-producing areas may hinder output in
the October-to-May crop period, which last year was seen at 1
million tons to 1.5 million tons, the Abidjan-based embassy said
in Les Echos d’Afrique l’Ouest, its monthly economic bulletin
covering West Africa. The embassy did not say how it obtained
the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
