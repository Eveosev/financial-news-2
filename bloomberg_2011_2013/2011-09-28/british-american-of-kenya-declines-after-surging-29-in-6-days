British American Investment Co.,
which started trading on the  Nairobi Stock Exchange  on Sept. 8,
declined for a second day as some investors sold stock to take
advantage of a 29 percent advance in a six-day rally.  Shares in the diversified financial services group fell 6
percent to 6.3 shillings by 12:29 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  “What you are seeing is some people getting out, mostly
those who got in when they thought the stock had bottomed out,”
Rufus Mwanyasi, head trader at Nairobi-based Canaan Capital
Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  The stock started trading at 8.45 shillings and traded as
weak as 5.25 shillings on Sept. 16, according to Bloomberg data.  British American shares had a reference price of 9
shillings when they started trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
