Food prices may remain elevated in
coming years as global populations increase and demand rises in
emerging markets, said David Dawe, a senior economist at the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.  “There’s going to be a lot of pressure on food prices in
coming years,” Dawe said in  New York  during a Bloomberg
Television interview on Surveillance Midday with  Tom Keene . “We
expect food prices to be higher as natural resources become
scarcer in some areas, and as demand continues to grow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
