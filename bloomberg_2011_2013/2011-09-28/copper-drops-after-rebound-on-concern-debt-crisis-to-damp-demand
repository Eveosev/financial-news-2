Copper declined in  London  after
rallying the most since February 2010 yesterday, as industrial
metals fell on concerns that European leaders’ divided opinions
to tame a sovereign debt crisis may damp demand for commodities.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 4.5 percent to $7,250 a metric ton, and
traded at $7,520 by 3:57 p.m. Shanghai time after jumping 4.5
percent yesterday to snap seven days of declines. The contract
has retreated 23 percent this quarter, poised for the biggest
loss since the period ending December 2008.  “Investors are still worried about the debt crisis in
 Europe , and the uncertainties over  Greece  have kept market
participants cautious,” Peng Qiang, an analyst at Cofco Futures
Co., said by phone from Beijing.  As many as seven of the 17 nations using the euro believe
private creditors should absorb bigger losses, a division that
may threaten an agreement reached with investors in July, The
Financial Times reported today, citing unnamed senior European
officials.  December-delivery metal on the Comex in  New York  dropped
2.3 percent to $3.3620 a pound. The December-delivery contract
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed 0.2 percent higher at
55,170 yuan ($8,631) a ton.  Citigroup Inc. lowered its zero to three-month copper
forecast to $7,000 a ton from $8,500 a ton due to “financial
uncertainty.” The metal may have to drop to $6,400, based on
the cost of production and a “buy versus build analysis,”
Citigroup analyst  Heath Jansen  wrote in a report dated
yesterday.  Copper prices could dip to as low as $6,000 before the end
of this year, given a weak growth outlook,  Edward Meir , a senior
commodity analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd., said in a report
yesterday. For 2012, the price range may be between $5,800 and
$9,300, with weakness concentrated in the first half of the
year, according to the report.  Aluminum climbed 0.6 percent to $2,259 a ton. Zinc declined
1.4 percent to $1,944 a ton, lead fell 1 percent to $2,005 a
ton. Nickel dropped 0.3 percent to $18,900 a ton, and tin was
little changed at $21,800.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
