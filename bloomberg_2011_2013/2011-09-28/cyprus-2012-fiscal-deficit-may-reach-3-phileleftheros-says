Cyprus may post a fiscal deficit of
3 percent of economic output in 2012 compared to a previous
forecast of 2 percent,  Phileleftheros  reported today, without
saying where it obtained the information.  The 2011 budgetary impact of the July 11 explosion at
Vasilikos power station may reach up to 1.5 percent of gross
domestic product, in turn triggering a fiscal deficit of as much
as to 6.5 percent of GDP this year, the Nicosia-based newspaper
said.  Cuts in social spending will be below 200 million euros
($273 million) which was the finance ministryâ€™s commitment to
the parliament, Phileleftheros reported.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
