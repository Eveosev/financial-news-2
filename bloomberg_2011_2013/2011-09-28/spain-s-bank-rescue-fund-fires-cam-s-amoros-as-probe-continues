Spain’s bank rescue fund fired
Maria Dolores Amoros, general director of  Caja de Ahorros del
Mediterraneo (CAM)  savings bank group, as it probes her pension awards
and the seized lender’s accounts.  The fund, known as FROB, believes the Alicante, Spain-based
lender disguised its true state during Amoros’s tenure, said a
CAM spokesman, who asked not to be identified in line with
company policy. Amoros was fired as FROB also probes the award
of her annual 364,947-euro ($498,000) pension, the spokesman
said in an interview.  The Bank of Spain  took over  CAM in July and put it under
FROB administration after the lender posted a first-half loss of
1.14 billion euros and said its loan-default ratio had more than
doubled to 19 percent since December. Today is the deadline for
banks interested in buying CAM to make non-binding bids for the
lender, which last week said that more than half its loans for
property development had gone bad.  The CAM spokesman said he couldn’t provide contact details
for Amoros, who has left the bank. Her name doesn’t appear in a
phone book for the Valencia region. A spokesman for the Bank of
 Spain  declined to comment.  CAM said in May that first-quarter profit fell 37 percent
to 39.8 million euros from a year earlier, adding that only 8.5
percent of its loans were doubtful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
