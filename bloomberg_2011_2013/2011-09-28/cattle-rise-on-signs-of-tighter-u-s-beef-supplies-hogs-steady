Cattle futures advanced for a
fourth straight session on signs that U.S. feedlots may
have fewer animals available for beef processors. Hogs were
unchanged.  Feedlots bought 2.252 million head of cattle in August,
down 0.8 percent from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said Sept. 23. Analysts were expecting a 7.8 percent
increase, a Bloomberg survey showed. The most expensive drought
in Texas history has parched pastures and forced ranchers to
shrink livestock herds.  “That report, for most, was a game changer,”  Lane Broadbent , a vice president of KIS Futures Inc. in  Oklahoma
City , said in a telephone interview. “There have been lower
placements and a lot of concern the last two to three days of
where our supply of beef is going to come from.”  Cattle futures for December delivery climbed 0.2 cent, or
0.2 percent, to settle at $1.2085 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Mercantile Exchange. The price gained 22 percent in the
past year.  The number of cattle available to sell to packers was also
smaller this week, signaling tighter supply, Broadbent said.  Exporters shipped 1.6 billion pounds (729,000 metric tons)
of beef in the seven months ended July 31, up 27 percent from a
year earlier,  U.S. Department of Agriculture   data  show.
Wholesale-beef prices gained 16 percent in the past year,
according to the USDA.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement gained 0.075
cent to close at $1.41925 a pound in Chicago.  Hog futures for December settlement closed unchanged at
83.475 cents a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
