Little Tikes, the maker of
childrenâ€™s play toys, is recalling more than 1.7 million
workshop and tool sets because oversized plastic toy nails are a
choking hazard.  The Hudson, Ohio-based company is conducting the recall
after two incidents of toy nails becoming lodged in the throats
of children, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said in
an e-mailed statement. The kids were treated in hospitals and
made full recoveries.  Consumers should remove the toy nails from play sets and
contact Little Tikes for free replacements, the commission said.
The toy nails are either red or blue and about 3.25 inches long
and 1.25 inches in diameter.  Little Tikes recalled 1.6 million workshop sets and trucks
with the same toy nails in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
