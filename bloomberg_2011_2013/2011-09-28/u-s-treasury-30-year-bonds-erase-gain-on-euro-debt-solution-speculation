Treasuries fell and 10-year note
yields increased the most over four days in almost three years
after orders for durable goods fell less than forecast and
European leaders sought to contain the region’s debt crisis.  Yields touched a one-week high as European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  said the region’s permanent bailout fund
should start sooner. Five-year note yields rose before the U.S.
government’s $35 billion auction of the securities.  “Durable goods, although it didn’t really impress too much
on the headline, showed some pretty good strength,” said Thomas Simons, a government debt economist in New York at Jefferies
Group Inc., one of 20 primary dealers obliged to participate in
U.S. government auctions. “There’s additional selling pressure
because of the auctions this week.”  Yields on 10-year notes increased seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 2.04 percent at 11:44 a.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.125
percent securities maturing in August 2021 slid 5/8, or $6.25
per $1,000 face amount, to 100 23/32.  The 10-year note yields touched 2.05 percent, the highest
level since Sept. 16. They have increased 33 basis points over
four days, the most since January 2009. The yields are still
poised for their third consecutive monthly drop after touching a
record low 1.6714 percent on Sept. 23.  A one-point drop in 30-year bonds pushed yields up five
basis points to 3.12 percent. Yields on five-year notes advanced
five basis points to 0.98 percent before the U.S. offering.  Auction Outlook  “The auction will go well,” said Jason Rogan, director of
U.S. government trading in  New York  at Guggenheim Partners LLC,
brokerage for institutional investors. “You’ve had a decent
enough concession where buyers will come in.”  The five-year notes due for sale yielded 1.020 percent in
pre-auction trading, versus 1.029 percent at the prior offering
on Aug. 24, which was a record low. Investors bid for 2.71 times
the amount offered last month, compared with the average of 2.76
for the past 10 auctions.  Yesterday’s $35 billion auction of two-year notes produced
the highest demand since September 2010 as some investors sought
refuge from European and U.S. turmoil. The government will sell
$29 billion of seven-year notes tomorrow.  Treasuries have rallied this quarter on demand for a refuge
from  Europe ’s debt crisis and a stalled American economy. U.S.
debt securities have returned 5.8 percent in the third quarter,
the most since the depths of the financial crisis in the fourth
quarter of 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. They have gained 1.1 percent in September.  Fed Debt Buying  Yields on 30-year bonds fell last week the most in almost
three years and two-year note yields increased after the  Federal
Reserve  announced on Sept. 21 it would buy $400 billion of bonds
with maturities of six to 30 years through June while selling an
equal amount of debt maturing in three years or less to support
growth under what is known as Operation Twist.  Orders for U.S. durable goods decreased 0.1 percent in
August after a 4.1 percent gain in the previous month, the
Commerce Department reported today in  Washington . The median
forecast of 77 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
0.2 percent decrease.  Treasuries also dropped as Barroso called for the faster
creation of a permanent-rescue fund and appealed to central
bankers to use their powers as the ultimate line of defense
against the debt crisis.  The European Stability Mechanism, due to begin in mid-2013,
will wield a 500 billion-euro ($681 billion) fund that may be
used more flexibly than the current guarantee-based temporary
financial backstop.  “Things are a little bit better in Europe, but we’re still
subject to tape bombs,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury
trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
