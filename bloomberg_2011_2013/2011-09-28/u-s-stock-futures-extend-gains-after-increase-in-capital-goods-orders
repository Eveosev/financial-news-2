U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains after government data showed orders for capital goods
climbed in August by the most in three months, tempering concern
that the economy is slowing.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December climbed 0.8 percent to 1,178.2 at 8:31 a.m. in  New
York . Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 79 points, or
0.7 percent, to 11,199.   Bookings for goods like computers and communications gear,
excluding military hardware and aircraft, climbed 1.1 percent,
the most since May, a Commerce Department report showed today in
 Washington . Demand for total durable goods dropped 0.1 percent,
less than forecast.  The  S&P 500  climbed 1.1 percent yesterday after Greece made
progress in meeting requirements for more international aid and
 Germany  vowed continued support for the country. Even so, the
rally has failed to convince U.S. options traders to lower their
guard against more losses.  Futures on the VIX show investors expect the Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index to remain at least 50 percent
above its historical average of 20.5 through May, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  A four-day rout last week erased $1 trillion from U.S.
equities amid concern Greek insolvency is inevitable and  Europe 
can’t contain the damage. The decline left the S&P 500 trading
at 12.4 times earnings in the past 12 months, 4.4 percent below
its average valuation at the lowest point during the last nine
bear markets, Bloomberg data shows.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
