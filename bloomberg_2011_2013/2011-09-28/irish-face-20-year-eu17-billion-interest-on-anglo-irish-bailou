Ireland is due to pay Anglo Irish
Bank Corp. and Irish Nationwide Building Society 17 billion
euros of interest over 20 years on 31 billion euros of
promissory notes it used to bail out the lenders, according to
the country’s  Finance Ministry .  Ireland issued the notes to the banks to avoid having to
raise more 30 billion euros straight away for the banks last
year. The banks used the notes as collateral to borrow funds
from the Irish central bank.  If “for illustrative purposes” Ireland borrowed to meet
the annual repayments, it would cost “just under” 180 million
euros per annum in interest costs for each 3.1 billion euros
borrowed, based on original 5.8 percent rate of Ireland’s
bailout program, the ministry said in reply to questions.  “In light of the recently agreed reduction in  interest
rates  on funding available under the joint EU/IMF Programme for
Financial Support, however, the estimated interest cost on such
borrowing reduces to 115 million euros per annum,” it said.  Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  wants to restructure the
promissory notes to lower Ireland’s debt burden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
