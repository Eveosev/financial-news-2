South Africa’s building confidence
index declined to 23 in the third quarter from 24 due to weak
demand for construction, especially in the “high-end market,”
 First National Bank  said.  “Constrained credit conditions, despite the low interest
rate, and oversupply continued to hamper the building trade,”
the Johannesburg-based lender, a unit of  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , said in
an e-mailed statement today.  “Increased investor uncertainty following renewed sharp
falls in global share markets and economic growth downgrades at
best point to continued weakness in the building industry in the
next quarter or so,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
