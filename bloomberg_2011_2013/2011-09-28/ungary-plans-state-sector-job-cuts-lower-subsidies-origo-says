The Hungarian government plans
“significant” public-sector job cuts in 2012 and will trim
subsidies for public transportation, as it seeks to meet its
budget deficit goal, news portal  origo.hu  reported, citing a

frozen, while pensions will increase by 4.2 percent from
January, according to the portal.  Total spending cuts will amount to 300 billion forint ($1.4
billion) next year, origo.hu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
