Kredyt Bank SA (KRB)  of Poland jumped the
most on record after  Gazeta Wyborcza  reported  Banco Santander SA (SAN) 
made a preliminary offer to buy the lender from  KBC Groep NV. (KBC)   The stock advanced as much as 17 percent to 13.5 zloty, the
biggest intraday gain since it started trading in 1994. The
shares were 12 percent higher at 12.9 zloty at 1:54 p.m. in
Warsaw, trimming this year’s decline to 12 percent and valuing
the bank at 3.5 billion zloty ($1.1 billion). KBC, the recipient
of 7 billion euros ($9.5 billion) in Belgian government rescue
funds, is selling Kredyt Bank and insurer Towarzystwo
Ubezpieczen i Reasekuracji Warta SA to repay the state.  “The market speculation is that if Santander strikes a
deal to buy the bank it will pay more than the current market
price,” said Aleksander Mazur, a stock trader at Espirito Santo
Investment SA in Warsaw.  KBC will decide within about two weeks whether to accept
Santander’s bid, the newspaper said, citing two people it didn’t
name. A spokesman for Santander, who asked not to be identified
in line with company policy, declined to comment on the
newspaper’s report when contacted by phone by Bloomberg News.  Santander bought  Bank Zachodni WBK SA (BZW) , Poland’s fifth-
largest lender, from Allied Irish Banks Plc earlier this year to
expand in central Europe’s largest financial-services market as
growth in western Europe stalls.  -- With assistance from Charles Penty in Madrid. Editors: Linda
