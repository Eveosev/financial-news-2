Saudi Arabia  excluded most adult
citizens from today’s municipal elections, betting that a
limited ballot coupled with $130 billion of extra spending will
be enough to halt Arab unrest at the kingdom’s borders.  Women weren’t entitled to stand as candidates or cast votes
in the ballot, which closed at 5 p.m. local time, and the
councilors chosen by Saudi men age 21 and over who aren’t in the
military will enjoy few powers. Still, the fact that the ballot
took place is an advance from two years ago, when the election
was first due and  King Abdullah  postponed it.  In between came the Arab revolts -- mass protests that
toppled the leaders of Egypt and  Tunisia  and spread to Saudi
neighbors Yemen and Bahrain. Saudi Arabia, holder of the world’s
biggest oil reserves, has relied chiefly on extra money for jobs
and housing to ward off unrest. Permitting today’s vote, only
the second in half a century, may be another part of that plan.  “The Saudi leadership is anxiously looking at what is
happening in the rest of the Arab world,” said  Paul Sullivan , a
political scientist specializing in Middle East security at
 Georgetown University  in  Washington . “There are considerable
unemployment and other social tensions in the country. Holding
these elections may be one of the leadership’s ways of trying to
calm some of those tensions.”  Turnout Figures  Early indicators suggested “a considerable voter
turnout,” Abdulrahman Dahmash, chairman of the country’s
election commission, said at a press conference in  Riyadh  today.
“We have seen that citizens are quite keen on participating in
a process where their voice counts.”  At the al-Malaz district voting station in Riyadh, election
officials said that out of 2,024 registered voters, more than
100 had cast ballots by 2:40 p.m.  Saudi Arabia’s jobless rate was 10 percent last year and it
needs to create 5 million jobs for nationals by 2030, Labor
Minister Adel Faqih said in January. The country may cut oil
output if falling prices threaten the financing for its budget-
stretching stimulus plan, HSBC Holdings Plc said this week.  Brent crude  is trading at about $105 a barrel, down 15
percent from its 2011 high in April. HSBC forecasts an average
price of $90 a barrel next year, and that’s about the level that
may prompt Saudi rulers to reduce supplies, the bank’s head of
Asian oil and gas research, Sonia Song, said on Sept. 26.  ‘Small Window’  Saudi Arabia largely escaped this year’s Arab unrest,
though its benchmark Tadawul AllShare Index fell as much as 20
percent in February and March as the revolts spread. Saudi
rulers sent troops to Bahrain to help quell demonstrations
there. There were some rallies in the mostly Shiite Muslim east
of Saudi Arabia, including in the village of al-Qatif where
Mohammed al-Shayoukh was standing.  In his campaign tent, as aides fired off messages on
Facebook and Twitter while tea was served at a stand outside,
the candidate admitted it was hard to generate voter interest.  “People were disappointed with the previous municipal
council,” elected in 2005, al-Shayoukh said in an interview.
Still, he said, the campaign is “the only election process that
people can participate in” and “a small window to make
changes.”  If elected, he said he will work to mediate between the
people of al-Qatif and local authorities, and expand the
“little power” that the council currently has.  More than 1 million Saudi men were registered to select
from 5,323 candidates for 2,112 council posts, according to the
kingdom’s  elections commission .  Engaging Voters  Political parties are banned in Saudi Arabia, an absolute
monarchy ranked as the least democratic country in the  Middle
East  by the Economist Intelligence Unit in its  2010 Democracy
Index .  To ensure a strong turnout, the commission ran advertising
campaigns in local newspapers. “Your voice is your duty,” said
an ad in Al-Riyadh newspaper.  “I needed to get to know the candidates,” said Mesaad
Bahatheq, a 50-year old doctor and one of three people who
turned up to vote at al-Malaz in the early afternoon. “I voted
for the one that I hope will help represent us.”  In another Riyadh district with 13,540 registered voters,
600 had cast ballots by 3 p.m., according to the Prince Salman
Center voting station.  Broaden Participation  The government needs to broaden participation and the role
of elected officials to engage more people, said Khalid al-
Dakhil, a political science professor at  King Saud University .
“We are only allowed to elect 50 percent of the members,” he
said in phone interview. The government appoints the rest.  Dahmash said a new code that will expand the powers of the
councils has been drafted and is awaiting approval.  When the last elections were held in 2005, Saudi forces
were battling al-Qaeda militants who were attacking foreign
nationals and government institutions and infrastructure.  “The situation has become more challenging, more in terms
of the regional dynamic than a hardcore internal al-Qaeda
threat,” said  Theodore Karasik , director of research at the
Dubai-based Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis.
Elections “may satisfy potential domestic opposition and
discontent.”  Next Elections  Saudi women will be allowed to join in the next election,
due in 2015, as voters and candidates, King Abdullah said this
week. Abdullah, born in 1924, has promised to improve the status
of women and opened the first co-educational university in 2009.  After the king’s decision, Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, president
of the Human Rights First Society, who had earlier said he
didn’t plan to vote, changed his mind. “I am going to a polling
station this morning because the king allowed women to
participate in the next municipal elections,” he said in a
phone interview.  Two days after the decision, two Saudi women were punished
for breaking the ban on female driving: One was arrested, and
the other was sentenced to 10 lashes by a court in Riyadh.
Princess Amira al-Taweel, wife of billionaire Saudi Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal, wrote on her Twitter account yesterday that
Abdullah has revoked the lashing sentence.  “Giving women the right to vote and to run for office may
also be a strategy to reduce some of the social and political
tensions,” Sullivan said. “The leadership sees slow reform as
the best, given the conservative nature of most of Saudi
society.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
