Finland ’s Prime Minister  Jyrki
Katainen  said he is “quite confident” euro area countries will
agree on collateral in exchange for the second Greek bailout.  Talks in Brussels “have gone well” and a solution to
Finland’s demand should be found within “days or weeks,”
Katainen said in an interview in parliament in Helsinki.
Finland’s approval of the European Financial Stability Facility
that is needed to pay out the Greek loans improves confidence on
the markets, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
