 Franklin Resource Inc. has no plan
to cut Korean debt holdings in its flagship bond fund, said Kim
Dong Il, who oversees 7 trillion won ($6 billion) of global debt
as chief investment officer for fixed income at  Franklin
Templeton  Investment Trust Management Co. in Seoul.  “Our view is that emerging markets are currently
undervalued, and that European banks are pulling out of the
market because of banks’ liquidity problems and not the
countries’ economic fundamentals,” Kim said by phone today.  Kim said that he can’t confirm comments from the Financial
Supervisory Service that Franklin Templeton sold about 200
billion won of  government bonds  yesterday, and added that some
funds may be selling Korean bonds as investors ask for
redemptions “but we are not actively reducing holdings.”  The company’s flagship bond fund, Templeton Global Bond
Fund had 15.6 percent of its portfolio in South Korean debt
as of June 30, Bloomberg data shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
