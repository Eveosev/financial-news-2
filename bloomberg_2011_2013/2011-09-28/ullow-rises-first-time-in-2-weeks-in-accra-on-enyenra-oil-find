Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  climbed for the
first time in almost two weeks in Accra trading after the U.K.-
based oil explorer with the most licenses in  Africa  said it
found oil at a well off the coast of  Ghana .  The stock rose 0.2 percent, the first increase since Sept.
15, to 31.11 cedis by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Accra.  The Enyenra-3A appraisal well in the Deepwater Tano license
offshore the West African nation encountered oil in high-quality
sandstone reservoirs, Tullow said in a regulatory statement
today.  “The news of the oil find is positive, and we saw some
investors reacting immediately,” Hilary Lomotey, a stock trader
at  Renaissance Capital , said by phone from Accra. “Tullow Oil
holds about 49.95 percent working interest in the Enyenra well,
where it found the oil.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
