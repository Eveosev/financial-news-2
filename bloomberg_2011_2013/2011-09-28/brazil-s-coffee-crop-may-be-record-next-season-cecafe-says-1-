Brazil , the world’s largest coffee
grower, may produce a record crop in the 2012-13 season, said
the nation’s coffee exporters’ council, known as CeCafe.  Output in the South American country will climb to 57
million to 58 million bags as trees enter the high-yielding half
of a two-year cycle, said Guilherme Braga, head of CeCafe. The
2012-13 season starts in July next year. The 2011-12 harvest
began in the summer and is expected to be 46 million to 47
million bags, he said.  “If the weather is favorable and rains fall in the right
period, production may be higher than in the previous high-
yielding season,” Braga said today in an interview at the
 International Coffee Organization  in  London . “Producers also
benefited from favorable prices during the current season and
therefore applied more fertilizers and tended to the crop.”  Dry weather earlier this year helped the harvest and the
quality of beans, although rains are now crucial for the
flowering of the 2012-13 crop, he said.  “Rains favor flowering and the lack of rainfall may affect
the uniform maturation of the beans,” he said, explaining that
it is better if all beans mature in the same period as there is
no selection during the harvesting process.  Area Expansion  Coffee prices climbed to a 14-year high earlier this year
and growers in Brazil are planting more trees in the same amount
of land, to increase productivity, Braga said.  The nation’s coffee exports will be 31 million to 32
million bags for 2011-12, down from 35 million bags in 2010-11,
he said.  “Exports last season were also helped by a production
shortfall in other countries like  Colombia ,” Braga said.  Bean inventories in the private sector in Brazil were at
9.2 million bags as of March 31. Stockpiles may rise to 10
million to 11 million bags by March 31, 2012, he said. That
would cover about two-and-a-half months of demand for internal
consumption and exports, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
