A joint venture including Tishman
Speyer Properties LP sold a 45-story  office tower  in downtown
Chicago to real estate equity fund Multi-Employer Property Trust
for $217.5 million.  The 928,040-square-foot (86,218-square-meter) building at
200 W. Madison St., was built in 1983 and renovated in 2006,
according to New York-based Tishman’s  website . The property is
88 percent leased, Washington-based Multi-Employer said in a
statement today.  Sales of downtown Chicago office properties have risen 48
percent to $1.12 billion this year as investors purchase
buildings outside the prime markets of New York,  San Francisco 
and Washington, according to real estate research company Real
Capital Analytics Inc.  “As those coastal markets have become really competitive
in many cases, and in some people’s views overpriced, more
people are moving to Chicago,”  Ben Thypin , director of market
analysis for New York-based Real Capital, said in a telephone
interview. “There’s so much capital chasing high-quality
properties in primary markets.”  CommonWealth REIT (CWH) , based in Newton, Massachusetts, bought
600 West Chicago, a 1.5 million-square-foot building where
online-coupon provider Groupon Inc. has its headquarters, for
$390 million, broker  HFF Inc. (HF)  said earlier this month.  The owners of Willis Tower in downtown Chicago are seeking
to sell North America’s tallest building or a stake in the
skyscraper, two people familiar with the plans said in June. The
building is owned by a partnership that includes New York
investors Joseph Moinian and Joseph Chetrit and American
Landmark Properties Ltd. of Skokie,  Illinois . In 2004, the group
paid $841 million for the property, then known as the Sears
Tower, according to Real Capital.  Multi-Employer, the buyer of 200 W. Madison, is a $5.1
billion real estate fund that is owned by more than 350 pension
plans. It has properties in 30 major U.S. metropolitan markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
