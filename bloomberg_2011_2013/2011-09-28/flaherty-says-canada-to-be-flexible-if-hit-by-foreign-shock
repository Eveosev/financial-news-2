Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  reiterated today that his government will be flexible
in terms of its economic policies if the country is hurt by
events coming from abroad.  “If we get a shock from outside our country we’ll have to
be responsive and we’ll be flexible and pragmatic,” Flaherty
told reporters outside parliament in Ottawa.  Flaherty met Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  and Bank of
Canada Governor Mark Carney yesterday to review last weekend’s
meeting of policy makers from the Group of 20 nations in
Washington. Flaherty declined to give details of that meeting
today.  Flaherty said his European counterparts understand the
seriousness of their sovereign debt crisis, and repeated they
should come up with enough money to “overwhelm” it.  Flaherty also said “flight-to-safety” flows in  currency
markets  have been affecting the value of the Canadian dollar,
which depreciated more than 1 percent against the  U.S. dollar 
today.  Flaherty also said his department is ‘very close’ to
finalizing an agreement to compensate Quebec for merging its
provincial sales tax with the federal government. A pact could
be done by the end of the week, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
