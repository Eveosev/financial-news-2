Calgary,  Canada ’s energy capital,
will lead economic growth among the country’s cities, helped by
expansion of the oil and gas industry and  population growth , an
economic institute forecast.  Calgary will post annual growth of more than 4 percent from
2013 to 2015, following a pace of about 3.5 percent next year,
said Mario Lefebvre, the director for the Centre for Municipal
Studies at the Conference Board of Canada, in a presentation
today. The city is adding about 25,000 people a year to its
population of about 1.2 million, he said.  “Population growth is such a huge boost to the economy,”
said Lefebvre. “Job growth this year has finally completed the
economic puzzle.”  Investment in  Alberta ’s oil sands, which will be about C$20
billion ($19.4 billion) this year, is helping to fuel growth in
Canada’s fourth-largest city, which has Canada’s second-highest
concentration of corporate headquarters. Growing demand for
energy will continue to provide economic growth, said Lefebvre.  Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi toured Ontario,  Quebec  and Nova
Scotia last week to promote the job opportunities in a bid to
stave off labor shortages, Lefebvre noted. Nenshi and the city
need to do a better job “drafting people” to come to Calgary
because it’s not an “international destination,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
