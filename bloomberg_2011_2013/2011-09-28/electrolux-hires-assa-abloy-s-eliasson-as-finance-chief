Electrolux AB (ELUXB) , the world’s second-
biggest appliance maker, hired  Assa Abloy AB (ASSAB) ’s Tomas Eliasson as
chief financial officer replacing Jonas Samuelsson, who will be
solely focused on a role overseeing  Europe , the Middle East and
Africa.  Eliasson is joining Electrolux from a similar role at Assa
Abloy, the world’s largest maker of locks, the maker of
Frigidaire appliances said in a statement. Electrolux and Assa
Abloy are both based in Stockholm. Outgoing CFO Samuelsson will
replace Enderson Guimaraes, who is taking up a position in North
America with PepsiCo Inc.  Eliasson’s move from Assa Abloy comes after the company
said Sept. 22 that its cost for closing or reshaping production
facilities would be “somewhat higher” than previously
believed. The economic slowdown is forcing Assa Abloy to
accelerate its cost-cut efforts in Europe and  North America , the
company said then.  Electrolux declined as much as 2.5 percent and was down 2.3
percent at 104.8 kronor as of 9:59 a.m. in Stockholm. The shares
have plunged 45 percent this year.  Assa Abloy fell as much as
3.3 percent. It has dropped 23 percent so far in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
