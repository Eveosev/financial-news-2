The European Commission said it is
unaware of any moves to increase private bondholders’ share in
 Greece ’s next bailout.  “As far as I’m aware, there is no such discussion within
the Eurogroup, which is the relevant body to consider issues
related to private sector involvement,” commission spokesman
 Amadeu Altafaj  told reporters in Brussels today.  The Eurogroup is composed of euro-area finance ministers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
