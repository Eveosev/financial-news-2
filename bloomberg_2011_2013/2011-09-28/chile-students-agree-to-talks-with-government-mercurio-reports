Chilean students will restart talks
with the government over changes to the education system without
putting a stop to demonstrations, El Mercurio  reported  in its
online edition.  Students will stage demonstrations in Santiago tomorrow and
will ask Education Minister Felipe Bulnes to give them a copy of
the 2012 budget proposal so they can study the governmentâ€™s
education program, the Santiago-based  newspaper  quoted protest
leader Camila Vallejo as saying at a press conference last
night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
