Nelson Peltz ’s hedge fund has cut
its holdings of H.J. Heinz Co. in half over the past three
months.  Trian Fund Management LP, Peltz’s New York-based activist
fund, held about 1 million Heinz shares as of yesterday,
according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. In June, Trian owned about 2 million shares,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In 2006, Peltz and his associates won board seats at Heinz,
the world’s biggest ketchup maker, and pushed Chief Executive
Officer William Johnson to increase advertising spending and
introduce healthier products. In 2007, Peltz held as many as 19
million Heinz shares.  Heinz, which is based Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania , lost 67
cents to $51 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have gained 3.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
