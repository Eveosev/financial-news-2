The Obama administration said it
needs more time to issue a rule that would double fuel-economy
standards for cars and light trucks in the U.S. by 2025.  The proposed rule, due out by Sept. 30, will take longer
than planned to write and won’t be out until “mid-November,”
Lynda Tran, a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail.  President Barack Obama in July announced that he would
raise the fleetwide fuel-economy average for passenger vehicles
to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 as part of his plan to reduce
dependence on foreign oil. His administration negotiated the
proposal, which would take effect in 2017, with automakers
including  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)   “Our team is working around the clock to make sure the
language in our proposal reflects the administration’s goal of
implementing an effective national program to reduce”
greenhouse-gas emissions and improve fuel economy, Tran said.  Dan Becker , director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a
Washington-based group that advocates for higher fuel-economy
standards, said he was told today by a White House official that
there is “nothing nefarious” in pushing back the rule’s
release date.  To contact the reporters on this story:
