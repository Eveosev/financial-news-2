     Sept. 28 (Bloomberg) --French banks remain “solid” in the
face of current market turbulence, Budget Minister Valerie
Pecresse said in an interview broadcast on Europe 1 radio today.  “Today, our banks are solid,” Pecresse said. “The
turbulence we’re currently going through means we need to put on
stabilizers, and the government is putting on stabilizers in the
form of the rescue plan for  Greece  and  Francois Fillon ’s anti-
deficit plan.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
