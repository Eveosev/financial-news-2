(Corrects to show unnamed people spoke about bid in first
paragraph.)  Croatia ’s Agrokor d.d. will
probably submit its offer for a majority stake in  Mercator
Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d. as early as tomorrow, Finance newspaper
 reported , citing people from Agrokor it didn’t name.  Croatia’s largest privately held company has already
secured about 700 million euros ($951 million) in a syndicated
loan from a group of European banks, including  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,
Societe Generale SA,  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Intesa Sanpaolo SpA,  Erste
Group Bank AG (EBS) , Raiffesisen Bank International AG and UBS AG, the
Ljubljana-based newspaper said.  Slovenian banks and other Mercator investors last month
appointed ING Bank NV to advise on the sale of just more than 50
percent of Mercator with the process likely to be completed by
the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
