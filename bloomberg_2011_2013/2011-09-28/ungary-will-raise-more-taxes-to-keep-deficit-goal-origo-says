Hungary ’s 2012 budget will bring in
further tax increases, on car purchases and business gifts among
other things, to help keep the deficit at the targeted 2.5
percent of gross domestic product,  Origo  reported.  The budget, which the government will discuss today, also
envisages 110 billion forint ($519 million) of extra revenue
from income tax changes announced earlier this month, the news
portal said late yesterday, citing a budget draft it obtained.  The draft foresees a deficit of 575 billion forint
excluding municipalities, Origo said. Including local
authorities, the budget gap is planned at 2.5 percent of GDP,
matching the number indicated to the European Union in Hungary’s
euro convergence plan, the portal added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
