Russian grain sellers understand
importers’ concerns about the country’s reliability as a
supplier following last year’s cereal-export ban, said Anna
Supryadkina, a senior specialist with the Russian Grain Union.  “The export ban was a very difficult time for the Russian
grain market,” Supryadkina said at the MENA Grains Summit in
Istanbul yesterday. “We totally understand it’s very difficult
for our partners from the MENA regions to believe us one more
time,” she said of buyers in the  Middle East  and North Africa.  Russia  resumed grain exports in July after an almost
yearlong ban prompted by its worst drought in half a century.
 Egypt , the world’s largest wheat importer, bought its first
Russian wheat cargo after the end of the ban on July 7, having
earlier dropped the country from its list of approved sources.  Wheat exports from Russia may jump fourfold to 16 million
tons in 2011-12 from 4 million tons in the previous season, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates , which would make the
country the world’s fourth-largest exporter of the grain behind
the U.S., Australia and  Canada .  “Our main advantage is always the price,” Supryadkina
said. “The message from our government now is, we are open for
export. If there’s an agreement, we will fulfil our obligations,
for sure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
