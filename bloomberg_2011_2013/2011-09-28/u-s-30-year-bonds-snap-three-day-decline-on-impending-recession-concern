Treasury 30-year bonds snapped a
three-day decline on speculation European efforts to solve the
region’s debt crisis will fail to stave off a recession in
developed economies.  The difference between U.S. five- and 30-year yields
narrowed to 2.12 percentage points from this year’s high of 2.88
percentage points in July. The spread shrank to 1.97 percentage
points on Sept. 23, the least since January 2010. The U.S. plans
to sell $35 billion of five-year debt today, the second of three
note auctions this week. The 10-year yield declined to a record
low of 1.6714 percent on Sept. 23.  “I can’t say the bond rally is over,” said Tsutomu Komiya, who helps oversee the equivalent of $120.9 billion as an
investor in  Tokyo  at Daiwa Asset Management Co., a unit of
 Japan ’s second-biggest brokerage by market value. “Globally,
the business cycle is fragile.”  The 30-year yield dropped one basis point to 3.06 percent
at 8:55 a.m. in London, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 3.75 percent security due in August 2041 rose 5/32,
or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 113 11/32.  Benchmark 10-year yields were little changed at 1.96
percent. The securities are poised for their third monthly gain,
with the yield falling 26 basis points from the previous month.
The rate will stay below 2 percent through October, Komiya said.
A Bloomberg survey of banks and securities companies projects
the yield will climb to 2.24 percent by year-end, with the most
recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  Barroso Comments  Treasuries trimmed gains after European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  said today the European Union should
accelerate the start-up of its permanent bail-out fund and the
EU will present a study of options on introducing common bonds
in coming weeks.  “Bond yields have been unjustifiably low for a while and I
guess the market is looking for a reason to get out of these
levels,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole CIB in London. “What Barroso said is the
catalyst for that. The crisis is not going to be over tomorrow,
but what he said suggested leaders are coming up with various
options to solve the problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
