South Korea ’s current-account
surplus narrowed to its lowest level in seven months in August
as the total amount of exports fell from previous months due to
fewer working days during the summer holiday season.  The surplus was $401.3 million, compared with a revised
$3.77 billion in July, the Bank of Korea said in a statement in
Seoul today. The current account is the broadest measure of
trade, tracking goods, services and investment income.  The Bank of Korea expects demand from emerging economies to
help the nation maintain a current-account surplus this year
even as  Europe ’s debt woes and a faltering U.S. recovery dim the
outlook for Asian exports. The surplus may help the won recover
after weakening, according to economist Lee Sung Kwon.  “The continued surplus in the current account will help
the Korean won rebound from the recent slump,” Lee at Shinhan
Investment Corp. in  Seoul , said before the report. “We can
expect the won to gain faster should global uncertainties
recede, especially over Europe’s debt issue.”  South Korea’s currency rose 0.25 percent 1,170.59 per
dollar yesterday in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The won is still down 8.3 percent for the month,
 Asia ’s worst performer, and touched a one-year low of 1,196.13
on Sept. 23.  The surplus on traded goods narrowed to $480.2 million last
month from a revised $4.73 billion in July, today’s report
showed. The services account deficit narrowed to $577.9 million
in August, compared with a deficit of $690.9 million in July.  Exports Rise  Total exports on a customs-cleared basis rose 25.9 percent
to $45.94 billion last month from a year earlier, compared with
a revised 21.7 percent gain to $49.18 billion in July, according
to today’s statement. Imports climbed 28.9 percent after
expanding 25 percent.  Overseas shipments probably gained 16.6 percent this month
from a year ago after expanding 25.9 percent in August,
according to the median forecast of 11 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The latest monthly trade data will be released
on Oct. 1.  Bank of Korea  Governor Kim Choong Soo and his board left
the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 3.25 percent for a
third straight month on Sept. 8 as the risk of the global
economy faltering outweighed inflation concerns. Consumer prices
surged 5.3 percent in August, the highest in three years,
exceeding the central bank’s 4 percent limit for the eighth
straight month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
