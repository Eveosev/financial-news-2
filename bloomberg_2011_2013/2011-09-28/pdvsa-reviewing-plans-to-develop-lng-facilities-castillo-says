Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA is
reviewing its plans to develop liquefied natural gas projects
for export because of low natural gas prices and high investment
costs, PDVSA Gas Director Anton Castillo said.  The country is aiming to increase natural gas production
and substitute 200,000 barrels a day of domestic oil consumption
in the next three years, Castillo told reporters today in Puerto
La Cruz, Venezuela.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
