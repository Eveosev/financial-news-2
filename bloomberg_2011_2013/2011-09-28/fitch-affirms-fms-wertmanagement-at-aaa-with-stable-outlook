FMS Wertmanagement AoR’s long-term
issuer default rating was affirmed at AAA with a “stable”
outlook at  Fitch Ratings . FMS is an independent public law
entity established to acquire 173 billion euros of non-
performing and non-strategic assets from Hypo Real Estate
Holding AG and its subsidiaries. Fitch sees an “extremely high
likelihood” of support from  Germany ’s bank rescue fund, Soffin,
and ultimately from the Federal Republic of Germany.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
