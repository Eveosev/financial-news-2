Sterling Bank Plc of  Nigeria ’s
shareholders approved the lender’s plan to acquire Equitorial
Trust Bank Plc, which was bailed out by the central bank in 2009
following a debt crisis.  “With the approval, Sterling Bank will take over all
assets and liabilities of Equitorial,” Suleiman Adegunwa,
chairman of Sterling, told reporters today in Lagos, the
commercial capital.  Equitorial Trust shareholders also approved the takeover at
a separate meeting in Lagos today, Adewale Sangowawa, chairman
of the bank, told reporters. The Lagos-based lender was one of
eight banks bailed out by the central bank two years ago with
the injection of 620 billion naira ($4 billion) after a debt
crisis that put the banking industry on the verge of collapse.
Regulators gave the lenders until Sept. 30 to recapitalize.  Three of them, Afribank Plc, Bank PHB Plc and Spring Bank
Plc were nationalized by the government on Aug. 5 after they
were deemed unlikely to meet the recapitalization deadline.  Sterling Bank (STERLNBA)  shares fell to the lowest in more than a year
in Lagos, losing 5 percent, or 6 kobo, to close at 1.15 naira.
The stock has plunged 50 percent this year, outpacing the 19
percent decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
