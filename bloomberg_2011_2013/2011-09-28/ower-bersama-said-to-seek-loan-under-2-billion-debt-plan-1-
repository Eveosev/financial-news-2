PT Tower Bersama Group is seeking a
$200 million, six-year loan as part of a $2 billion debt
program, said two people familiar with the matter.  The loan, which has an average life of around 4.5 years,
pays a margin of 375 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate to lenders domiciled in Indonesia, and 350 basis
points to offshore lenders, said one of the people, declining to
be identified because details are private.  The loanâ€™s senior bank group includes  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.,
DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Credit Agricole CIB, Standard Bank
Group Ltd., Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. and  United Overseas
Bank Ltd. (UOB) , the people said. The loan will be signed next week by
the senior lenders.  About 10 percent to 15 percent of the loan may be sold to
other banks as part of a limited syndication, one of the people
said.  Tower Bersama investor relations manager Edison Bako
declined to comment on the financing when contacted on his
mobile phone today.  The $200 million facility is the third borrowed by Tower
Bersama under the $2 billion debt program, one of the people
said. Tower Bersama previously borrowed $300 million and $50
million, that person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
