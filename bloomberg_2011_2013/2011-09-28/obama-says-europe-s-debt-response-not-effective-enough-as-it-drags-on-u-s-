President  Barack Obama  for the
second time this week criticized the response of European
governments to the continent’s debt crisis, saying the turmoil
continues to be a drag on the  U.S. economy .  “Some of the challenges that we’ve had over the last
several months actually have to do with the fact that, in
Europe, we haven’t seen them deal with their banking system and
their financial system as effectively as they needed to,” Obama
said yesterday in response to a question about U.S. economic
growth at a roundtable discussion on Hispanic issues at the
White House.  Obama didn’t specify what steps should be taken.  Amid concern that a default by Greece could plunge the
global economy into a recession, the administration has stepped
up public pressure on European leaders to resolve the 18-month
sovereign-debt crisis. The issue will be at the top of the
agenda when Obama joins other leaders from the Group of 20
nations for a Nov. 3-4 summit in  France .  Obama’s remarks yesterday followed comments he made Sept.
26 that Europe hadn’t “fully healed from the crisis back in
2007 and never fully dealt with all the challenges to their
banking system.”  “So they’re going through a financial crisis that is
scaring the world,” he said at a town hall event in  Mountain
View ,  California , where he was promoting his plan to revive U.S.
economic growth and hiring.  ‘Catastrophic Risk’  At the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund
and  World Bank  on Sept. 24 in Washington, Treasury Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner  warned that failure to combat the Greek-led
turmoil could lead to “cascading default, bank runs and
catastrophic risk.” He urged governments to work with the
 European Central Bank  to beef up the euro-zone bailout fund.  “It would be safe to say they’ve ratcheted it up,” Pierre Ellis, senior global economist at the research firm Decision
Economics in  New York , said of recent comments by Obama and
Geithner.  “What everybody fears is a sort of Round II of a credit
crunch,” Ellis said.  Europe  may be “very vulnerable to
problems with debt over there and that, in turn, causing
problems for our banks. And, of course, the White House is
certainly not averse to finding reasons for problems in our
economy.”  As investors watched for signs of progress in Europe’s
efforts to deal with the debt crisis, U.S. stocks halted a
three-day rally and the euro reversed an early gain versus the
dollar. Treasuries trimmed losses as the 10-year note’s yield
headed for its biggest increase over four days since January
2009.  Stocks Slide  The  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index lost 2.1 percent to
1,151.26 in New York yesterday after climbing 0.8 percent
earlier and rallying 4.1 percent over the previous three
sessions. The euro weakened 0.3 percent to $1.3548, erasing a
0.8 percent advance. Ten-year yields rose two basis points to
2.01 percent and have climbed 27 points in four days.  The administration has been in contact with European
governments, urging officials “at the presidential level, at
the ministerial level” to “take forceful and direct action”
to deal with the crisis, White House press secretary  Jay Carney 
said at a briefing yesterday after Obama spoke.  While the debt situation in Europe is “certainly a matter
of concern,” Obama administration officials continue to believe
that governments there have the “financial wherewithal” to
deal with the crisis, Carney said.  European Meeting  Experts from the European Commission, the European Central
Bank and the International Monetary Fund are scheduled to return
to  Athens  today as officials race to put in place measures to
contain fallout from  Greece . They will resume a review of
whether Greece has met conditions for the next slice of the
initial, 110 billion euro ($150 billion) bailout package
engineered last year.  Obama is facing re-election next year and the economy will
be the top issue in the presidential contest and campaigns for
Congress.  The Office of Management and Budget, in an August update of
economic administration forecasts, projected the U.S. economy
will grow at a sluggish 1.7 percent rate this year and the
jobless rate will average 9.1 percent. At the start of the year,
the White House forecast a growth rate of 2.7 percent.  Growth will pick up in 2012, with the economy expanding 2.6
percent on a year-over-year basis, the OMB said.  Severe Repercussions  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for global
growth and predicted “severe” repercussions if Europe fails to
contain its debt crisis or U.S. policy makers deadlock over a
fiscal plan.  Pressure from the U.S. has caused friction with Europe.
Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said earlier this month
that she found it “peculiar” to be lectured by the U.S., a
country with higher aggregate debt than the euro area.  The OMB forecasts the federal  budget deficit  will be $1.3
trillion for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 -- 8.8 percent
of gross domestic product -- and $956 billion in fiscal 2012.
The budget office’s estimates total deficits over the next
decade at $5.75 trillion from 2012-2021.  Obama’s proposals for cutting the long-term  U.S. debt  have
run into resistance from Republicans, who control the  House of
Representatives  and oppose raising taxes to narrow the deficit.  After partisan disputes dragged out negotiations in July
over raising the government’s borrowing authority, Standard &
Poor’s lowered the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA on Aug.
