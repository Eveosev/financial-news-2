Gold declined for the fifth time in
six sessions as the dollar’s rebound eroded demand for the metal
as an alternative investment, and concerns that the global
economy will falter drove equities and raw materials lower.  Most advanced nations are lapsing back into recession,
while the U.S. is already in the throes of an economic
contraction, said  Nouriel Roubini , the chairman of Roubini
Global Economics LLC. The greenback rose as much as 0.7 percent
today against a basket of currencies, and the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index of equities fell 2.1 percent. The S&P GSCI index of 24
raw materials headed for the biggest quarterly slump since 2008,  “People are trading gold as a commodity today,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “The strength in the dollar is not helping
matters either.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $34.40, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $1,618.10 at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. In trading after the settlement, the metal touched
$1,600.50. The price has tumbled 16 percent from a record
$1,923.70 on Sept. 6.  Silver futures for December delivery declined $1.402, or
4.4 percent, to $30.134 an ounce in  New York .  On Sept. 26, the most-active contract fell as much as 13
percent to a 10-month low of $26.15. Yesterday, the price jumped
5.2 percent.  “We would stay out of the silver market at the moment,”
 Edel Tully , a London-based analyst at UBS AG, said in a report.
“It is the most irrational of metals, and certainly not for the
fainthearted.”  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery slumped $39.30, or 2.5 percent, to $1,538.10 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December fell $15.20, or 2.3
percent, to $634.75 an ounce.  To contact the reporters for this story:
