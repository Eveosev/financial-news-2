The result of an auction of German
five-year bonds today that gained fewer bids than were available
is “still positive” for the government, Joerg Mueller,
spokesman for the Federal Finance Agency in  Frankfurt  said in an
interview. The bid-cover ratio was 1.0.  German five-year notes declined after the auction as yields
at the sale fell to the lowest on record, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
