A $30 billion Obama administration
program to stimulate small-business lending closed yesterday
having distributed more than $4 billion, the U.S. Treasury
Department said today.  Treasury officials have blamed the low performance of the
Small Business Lending Fund on 40 percent of the applicants not
meeting minimum requirements. The Treasury said in a statement
today that more than $4 billion in capital went to 332 community
banks nationwide, adding that the final round of funding has
been made.  “This $4 billion investment, which will help propel
lending by main street banks in many multiples of that amount is
good for our economy and good for America’s small businesses,”
Treasury Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin said in the statement.  Fund officials approved lending for community banks with
less than $10 billion in assets. The banks are to receive
capital financing with incentives to increase loans to small
companies as a way to stimulate growth.  The program came to a statutorily mandated end yesterday.
President  Barack Obama  last year praised the program as a key
effort to help the economic recovery.  In total, 933 institutions applied for $11.8 billion in
SBLF funding.  To contact the reporters on this story:
