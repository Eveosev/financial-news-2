Switzerland  may ban facial veils,
including the burqa worn by some Muslim women, after the
country’s lower chamber of parliament backed a resolution called
’Down With the Masks!’  Today’s approval by 101 lawmakers to 77 with nine
abstentions in Bern means the motion, proposed by Oskar
Freysinger, a representative of the  Swiss People’s Party , now
passes to the upper house.  If Freysinger succeeds, Switzerland would follow the
Netherlands,  France , which proscribed veils in April, and  Italy ,
where a 1975 terrorism law prohibits people from concealing
their face to disguise their identity. Belgium’s parliament is
also debating a ban. The SVP’s proposal would outlaw face
coverings in government buildings, at demonstrations and on
public transportation.  “In a time when people are feeling increasingly unsafe on
our streets, more and more people are hiding themselves behind
hoods, masks or full-body veils,” Freysinger wrote in the text
of the motion. “That makes it impossible to identify them,
especially in cases of violence.”  The SVP is the largest faction in the Swiss legislature. In
2007 it campaigned on an anti-immigration platform to win a
bigger share of the vote.  Posters in Zurich promoting its bid in national elections,
due on Oct. 23, depict a boot trampling a Swiss flag and the
slogan “stop mass immigration.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
