A proposed change in Turkish law to
drop reciprocity conditions and allow more non-Turkish nationals
to buy property in the country will create a $10 billion real-
estate market spurred by sales to Arabs,  Sabah  reported.  Companies including  Saudi Arabia ’s Saudi Binladin Group and
Kuwait’s Mena Real Estate have opened units in  Turkey  in recent
weeks in anticipation of the change, the newspaper said.  Urban Planning Minister Erdogan Bayraktar is expected to
introduce legislation to drop the reciprocity requirement in
real-estate purchases in parliament in coming days, Sabah said.  Passage of the legislation is expected to spur purchases
from buyers in Saudi Arabia, Syria, Dubai, Azerbaijan, Qatar and
Iran, the newspaper said, citing Isik Gokkaya, chairman of the
Turkish real estate trust association GYODER.
