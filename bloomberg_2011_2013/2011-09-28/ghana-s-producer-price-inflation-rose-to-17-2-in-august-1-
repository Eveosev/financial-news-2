Ghana ’s producer-price inflation
rate increased for the second consecutive month to 17.2 percent
in August, as mining and quarrying costs rose.  Inflation accelerated from a revised 13.9 percent in July,
 Grace Bediako , a statistician at the Ghana Statistical Service
told reporters in the capital, Accra, today.  Mining and quarrying costs, which account for 14 percent of
the overall index, rose 47 percent from 34 percent the month

after  South Africa . Diamond, manganese, and bauxite are also
mined in the West African nation.  Manufacturing costs, which make up 70 percent of the index,
increased 16 percent in August compared with a revised 14
percent the month earlier, while utility costs were unchanged at
