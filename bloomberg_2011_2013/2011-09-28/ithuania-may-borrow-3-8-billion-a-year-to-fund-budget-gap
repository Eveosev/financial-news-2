Lithuania said it may borrow 9.5
billion litai ($3.8 billion) a year in 2012 and 2013 to finance
its budget deficit and refinance maturing debt.  Borrowing may fall to 6 billion litai in 2014, the
government, based in the capital, Vilnius, said today on its
website. State debt is projected to narrow to 35.4 percent of
gross domestic product by 2014 from an estimated 38.1 percent
this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
