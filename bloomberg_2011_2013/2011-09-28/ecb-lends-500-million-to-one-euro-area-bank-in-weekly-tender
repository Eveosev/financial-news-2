The  European Central Bank  said it
will lend dollars to one euro-area bank tomorrow.  The ECB today allotted $500 million to one bidder in a
regular seven-day liquidity-providing operation at a fixed rate
of 1.09 percent. Last week, the Frankfurt-based ECB also lent
$500 million to one institution. The ECB doesn’t identify the
banks it lends to.  The spreading sovereign debt crisis in  Europe  has
heightened concerns about banks’ balance sheets, causing
financial institutions to become reluctant to lend to each
other. Global equity markets rallied after the ECB said on Sept.
15 it will coordinate with the  Federal Reserve  to offer a series
of three-month dollar loans to euro-area banks to ensure they
have enough of the currency for the rest of the year.  The premium European banks pay to borrow in dollars through
the swaps market is close to the highest level in almost three
years. The cost of converting euro-based payments into dollars,
as measured by the one-year cross-currency basis swap, was 98
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor,
at 11 a.m. in  Frankfurt , indicating a premium to buy the
greenback. It widened to as much as 112.5 basis points earlier
this month, the most since Dec. 2, 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  European banks need dollars to fund their own lending in
the U.S. as well as to clients elsewhere doing business in the
world’s leading reserve currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
