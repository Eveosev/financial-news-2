Whirlpool Corp., the world’s
largest appliance maker, asked a jury to award it $16.2 million
in damages from  South Korea ’s  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  for infringing
a patent for refrigerator icemakers.  LG, based in Seoul, sued  Benton Harbor , Michigan-based
Whirlpool in 2008 in federal court in Delaware. Whirlpool
countersued, and a jury in March 2010 determined LG infringed
Whirlpool’s technology.  Lawyer Scott F. Partridge, representing Whirlpool, told
jurors in his opening statement today that contrary to LG’s
assertions, the patent is valid because “we provided a specific
description” of the invention.  “They think we should just write a check and go home,”
although the patent is faulty, LG lawyer J. Michael Jakes said
as the trial started.  In the earlier trial, a jury awarded Whirlpool $1.78
million from LG for infringement. Chief U.S. District Judge
Gregory M. Sleet questioned the jury’s calculations and ordered
a new trial on validity and damages.  Whirlpool fell $2.83 or 5.3 percent to $51.41 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:02 p.m. LG shares rose
1,500 won to 61,900.  The case is LG Electronics v.  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) , 08CV234,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 6,082,130.  To contact the reporter on this story:
