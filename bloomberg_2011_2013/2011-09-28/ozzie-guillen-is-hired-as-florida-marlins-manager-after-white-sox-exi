Ozzie Guillen was hired as manager
of the  Florida Marlins , two days after being released from his
contract with the  Chicago White Sox .  Guillen, 47, agreed to a four-year contract with the
Marlins, who have a 72-89 record this season and are opening a
$515 million ballpark next season in downtown Miami. The Marlins
didn’t disclose financial terms of his contract.  “He’s a man of passion, this is what this club needs,”
Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria said at a televised news conference.
“I couldn’t be happier. We needed more energy going into our
new ballpark. It’s all about timing.”  As compensation for releasing Guillen from his contract,
the White Sox will receive two minor league prospects: infielder
Ozzie Martinez and reliever Jhan Marinez.  Guillen spent eight years with the White Sox and guided the
team to a 678-617 record and a World Series title in 2005. He
had one year remaining on his contract in  Chicago  and said he
didn’t want to return without a new deal for more money.  “My goal is to have a lot of media and a lot of fans
because that means we’re winning and have a good product on the
field,” Guillen said in Miami.  Guillen will replace Jack McKeon, who’s retiring after the
team’s final game of the season on Sept. 28. McKeon, 80, is the
second-oldest manager in major-league history behind Connie Mack, who ran the  Philadelphia Athletics  at 87 in 1950.  To contact the reporter on this story:
