The  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  said it will speed up a review of draft liquidity
rules for lenders that are intended to take effect at the start
of 2015.  The review will be completed “well in advance” of an
original mid-2013 deadline for finishing an assessment of the
measures, the group said today.  The so-called liquidity coverage ratio requires banks to
hold enough easily saleable assets to survive a 30-day credit
crunch.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
