OCI Co.,  South Korea ’s biggest
polysilicon maker, fell to its lowest price in 16 months in
Seoul trading after Shinhan Investment Corp. halved its share-
price estimate on concern profit may decline.  The shares fell as much as 13.5 percent to 192,000 won, the
lowest since May 26, 2010, and traded at 196,500 won as of 1:05
p.m. on the Korea Exchange. The stock is the worst performer
today on the benchmark  Kospi 200 index. (KOSPI2)   OCI will become “a fast mover” in responding to changes
in global prices, shifting from its earlier position of being a
passive follower, the Seoul-based company told analysts
yesterday, according to its website.  As supplies exceed demand in the global market, waning
prices of solar-cell products “are expected to sustain until
the end of this year,” Lee Eungju, an analyst at Shinhan
Investment, said in a Sept. 28 note to investors. The shift in
OCI’s price policy is likely to affect the company’s
profitability in the short term, he said.  While Lee maintained his “buy” recommendation on OCI
stock, he lowered his 12-month target price to 320,000 won from
645,000 won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
