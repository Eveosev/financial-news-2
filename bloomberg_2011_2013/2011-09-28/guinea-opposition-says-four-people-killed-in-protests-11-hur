Four people were killed in protests
in  Guinea’s  capital, Conakry, yesterday and another 11 wounded,
according to Faya Millimono, spokesman for a group of 19
opposition parties that organized the demonstrations.  The deaths and injuries happened amid clashes with police
who used tear gas to disperse the political groups’ protest
against the country’s electoral commission. The parties claim
the body lost credibility in its handling of a 2010 presidential
vote, citing delays in the organization of a runoff and the
appointment of an army general from  Mali  as interim head of the
commission less than a month before the second round.  The injuries were caused by gun shots and cuts, Millimono
said by phone today.  Security forces “do not use firearms,” General Mamadouba
Toto Camara, minister of security and civil protection, told
reporters yesterday.  The opposition groups will continue their protests
following the two-year commemoration today of a massacre at a
stadium in Conakry, Millimono said. “We will pursue peaceful
demonstrations from tomorrow even if we know that the government
has decided to suppress them,” he said.  Guinea  is the world’s biggest exporter of bauxite, the
ingredient used in aluminum. Companies including United Co.
Rusal, Rio Tinto Plc and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. operate in the
West African nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
