India ’s 10-year bond yield rose to
the highest level in 1 1/2 weeks on speculation the central bank
will keep monetary conditions tight after Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao said inflation remains above the comfort level.  The  finance ministry  may decide on the government’s debt
sale calendar tomorrow for the six months starting Oct. 1, a
ministry official with direct knowledge of the matter said on
Sept. 26. The government has completed 60 percent of its 4.17
trillion rupees ($86 billion) borrowing target for the fiscal
year that began April 1. Inflation has been “fairly stubborn,”
Subbarao said on Sept. 26.  “Inflation is still at elevated levels and the central
bank’s tone continues to be hawkish,” said  Anoop Verma , a
fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“Investors are also staying on the sidelines for clarity on the
borrowing calendar.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent securities due April 2021 rose
2 basis points to 8.34 percent at the 6 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s the
highest level since Sept. 16. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. The central bank extended trading by an hour today after
selling 100 billion rupees of treasury bills.  India’s benchmark wholesale-price inflation accelerated to
a 13-month high of 9.78 percent in August. The central bank has
boosted borrowing costs six times this year, lifting the
repurchase rate to 8.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
