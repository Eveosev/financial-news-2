Thailand’s baht may fall 3.6
percent by the end of this year after the currency surpassed key
technical levels this week, according to Okasan Securities Co.  The baht may reach 32.10 per dollar, the weakest level
since August 2010, after it formed a so-called “double-top”
pattern against the greenback, which signals further losses are
likely, said  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and currency dealer at Okasan.
The formation was completed when the baht weakened below a Jan.
31 low of 31.21 yesterday.  “There is downside potential for the baht in the next
three months or so,” said Tokyo-based Soma. “But the next
technical target level seems to be quite a big resistance and
the baht may return to its long-term appreciation trend.”  The baht declined 0.2 percent to 30.95 per dollar as of
9:27 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Soma’s 32.10 estimate is a 38.2 percent retracement on the
Fibonacci chart. On Sept. 26, the currency breached a 23.6
percent reversal of its gain from a March 2009 low of 36.37 to a
November 2010 high of 29.46, according to a series of numbers
known as the Fibonacci sequence.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Other Fibonacci levels are 50 percent, 61.8 percent and 76.4
percent.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
