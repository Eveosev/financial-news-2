Eastman Kodak Co. (EK) , the 131-year-old
camera maker that tapped a  credit line  last week, is likely to
default on its debt and liquidating the company may produce the
biggest return to investors,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Kodak was downgraded to CC, the eighth level below
investment grade, signifying that “default of some kind appears
probable,” New York-based Fitch said today in a statement. The
company, which has a market value of $417 million, may have an
adjusted reorganization value of about $1.4 billion, Fitch said.  Chief Executive Officer Antonio Perez is trying to turn
Kodak around by selling patents to continue funding its consumer
and commercial inkjet printing units and has projected the
businesses may generate an operating profit by 2013. The company
is headed for its sixth loss in the past seven years.  Drawing $160 million from a credit facility “likely
signifies weaker-than-expected  cash flow  in the second half of
2011,”  Brian Taylor , a Fitch analyst in New York, wrote today
in a note to clients. Proceeds from selling patents won’t
materially improve the company’s credit profile without an
improvement in free cash flow, he said.  “We are committed to meeting all our obligations,” Gerard
Meuchner, a spokesman, said in today an e-mail.  Kodak tumbled 27 cents, or 15 percent, to $1.55 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The price was
the lowest since at least January 1974, according to Bloomberg
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
