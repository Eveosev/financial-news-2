Indonesia  has “informally” asked
mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds not to sell
shares in the market, Nurhaida, chairman of the nation’s capital
market regulator, said in Jakarta today.  Indonesia doesn’t see the need to ask state companies to
buy back their shares, Nurhaida said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
