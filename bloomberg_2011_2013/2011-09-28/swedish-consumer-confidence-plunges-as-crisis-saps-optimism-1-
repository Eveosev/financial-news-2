Swedish  consumer confidence  fell
more than estimated in September as a deepening European debt
crisis sapped optimism in the largest Nordic economy.  The consumer confidence index fell to minus 5.8, the lowest
since June 2009, from 4.3 in the prior month, the Stockholm-
based National  Institute of Economic Research  said today.
Economists predicted 1.2, according to the median of 14
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. An index for manufacturing
confidence held at minus 3.  The Swedish central bank this month left its benchmark repo
rate unchanged at 2 percent, halting a cycle of seven
consecutive increases since July last year. The bank said fiscal
tightening in  Europe  and the U.S. will slow growth in  Sweden ’s
economy, where exports account for about half the output.  The institute’s survey also showed expectations for
inflation in 12 months fell to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
