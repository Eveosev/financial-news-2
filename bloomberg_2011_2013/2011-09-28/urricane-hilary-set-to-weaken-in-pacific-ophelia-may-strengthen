Tropical Depression Ophelia east of
the Virgin Islands may grow into a more powerful storm, while
Hurricane Hilary stirred up surf along southern  Baja California 
beaches, the National Hurricane Center said.  Ophelia was about 205 miles (330 kilometers) east of the
Caribbean’s northern Leeward Islands, and heading northwest at 3
mph, the center said today in an online advisory. Packing 35 mph
winds, the system is forecast to become a tropical storm later
in the day with winds of at least 39 mph and be a hurricane when
it passes east of  Bermuda  later this week.  As much as 3 inches (8 centimeters) of rain from Ophelia
may soak the Virgin Islands, the NHC said. Forecasters are also
monitoring Tropical Storm Philippe in the Atlantic between  Cape
Verde  and the Leewards. That system has 40 mph winds and is
forecast to weaken into a depression without threatening land.  Hurricane Hilary off  Mexico ’s west coast was “steadily
weakening,” according to the center, which said its winds
dropped to 90 mph today from 105 mph yesterday. More than 600
miles from Baja California, Hilary isn’t predicted to hit land
though “life-threatening surf and rip current conditions” are
affecting the southern coast of the peninsula, the NHC said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
