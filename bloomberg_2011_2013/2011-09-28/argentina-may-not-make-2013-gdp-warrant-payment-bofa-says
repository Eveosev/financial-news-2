Payment for  Argentina ’s GDP
warrants in 2013 is “at risk” as the government may report
growth levels below the 3.26 percent threshold in 2012, Bank of
America Merill Lynch said in a report.  Argentina will make dividend payments of $4.38 on Dec. 15
that will cost the government $3 billion, according to the
report. The dividend payment next year will be 30 percent
higher, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
