Palm Hills Developments SAE, an
Egyptian luxury real-estate developer, said its board of
directors has approved returning to the government a 190 feddan
(1 feddan = 1.038 acres) land plot on the outskirts of Cairo to
“reduce future financial burdens on the company.”  The company hadn’t developed or marketed the property,
located in the so-called eastern expansion area of Sixth of
October City, it said in a filing to the Egyptian bourse today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
