Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  is
scheduled tomorrow for the first time to solicit the views of
U.S. combatant commanders on where the budget can be cut and
U.S. missions scaled back, his spokesman said today.  “There will be a wide-ranging discussion on variety of
options,” spokesman George Little said today. “That’s
something the secretary looks forward to. He wants to have an
open dialog with the commanders and other senior leaders to
solicit their views.”  Commanders will be briefed on the ideas being discussed in
the Pentagon’s internal review of U.S. strategies, roles and
missions, he said. Panetta said the meeting would be a
“conversation” and would not be handing out budget targets,
according to Little.  The Pentagon has been told by the White House to reduce its
spending plans by about $450 billion over 10 years, under the
U.S. Budget Control Act passed by Congress. Another $500 billion
in automatic cuts may be imposed if a supercommittee of
lawmakers fails to find $1.5 trillion in overall federal
savings, according to the  Congressional Budget Office .  Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen told a
business group last week the cumulative cuts might be as high as
$1.1 trillion.  The $1.1 trillion in cuts, depending on the baseline used,
represents between 15 and 18 percent of an estimated $6.14
trillion 10-year spending projection, according to Pentagon
officials, budget analysts and a review of Office of Management
and Budget figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
