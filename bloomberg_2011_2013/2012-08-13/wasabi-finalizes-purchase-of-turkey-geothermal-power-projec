Wasabi Energy (WAS) , an Australian company
investing in clean energy, finalized the purchase of an option
for a 50 percent interest in a geothermal project in  Turkey .  Wasabi concluded the purchase with the final payment of
$2.65 million for the Tuzla Geothermal Power Project, the
Melbourne-based company said in a statement today.  Subject to the exercise of the option, the project will be
developed as a 50-50 venture with Egenda Ege Enerji Uretim A.S.,
according to the statement. Egenda is an independent power
producer in Izmir, Turkey.  The option is exercisable until December 2013 and Wasabi
Energy will be required to pay about $3.6 million for the
exercise, Wasabi said.  The project hosts a recently installed and currently
operating 7.5 megawatts power plant with additional development
opportunities, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
