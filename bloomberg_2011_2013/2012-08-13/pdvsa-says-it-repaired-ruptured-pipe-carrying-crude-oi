Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state
oil company, said it repaired a ruptured pipe carrying  crude oil 
from the Orinoco Belt to the company’s refineries in Puerto La
Cruz, Anzoategui state.  PDVSA, as the company is known, ceased pumping oil after a
26-inch pipe fractured at around 8 a.m. local time, the company
said in a statement. It didn’t say when it resumed extraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
