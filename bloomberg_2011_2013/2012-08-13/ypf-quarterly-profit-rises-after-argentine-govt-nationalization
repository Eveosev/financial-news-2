YPF SA (YPF)  said quarterly profit climbed
8 percent on higher  oil prices  in the first report since the
Argentine company was nationalized by President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner .  Net income increased to 833 million pesos ($181 million),
or 2.12 pesos a share, from 771 million pesos, or 1.96, a year
earlier, Buenos Aires-based YPF said in a statement to the
regulator after the market closed on Aug. 10.  YPF said oil production gained 24 percent in the quarter on
higher local prices and also there wasn’t a repeat of reduced
output in the southern provinces of Chubut and  Santa Cruz 
because of strikes a year ago. Local oil prices rose 24 percent
to $70.4 a barrel, the company said. Investments climbed 25
percent to 3.4 billion pesos from a year ago, YPF said.  Fernandez seized a 51 percent stake from Spain’s  Repsol SA (REP) 
in April. Miguel Galuccio was named as chief executive officer
to halt declining output and stem fuel imports that doubled to
$9.4 billion last year. Galuccio said Aug. 9 the Argentine
producer cut fuel imports by 54 percent in the last three
months.  The Argentine government wants to tap shale reserves that
may hold at least 23 billion barrels of oil equivalent in
southern Argentina’s Vaca Muerta fields. The government has said
Madrid-based Repsol underinvested since it acquired YPF in 1999.  Shale-Oil Investments  YPF will invest $7 billion in 2013 as it plans to double
exploration in five years and boost refining, Galuccio said June
6. The company targets investments of $1.2 billion in shale oil
next year, he said.  Oil exports fell 14 percent in the period, while domestic
sales gained 2 percent.  YPF’s refining unit operating profit dropped 27 percent.
Refined exports slid 14 percent in the period.  The report was released after the close of regular trading
today. YPF’s  American depositary receipts  gained 0.6 percent to
$11.69 in  New York  on Aug. 10. The ADRs have plunged 66 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
