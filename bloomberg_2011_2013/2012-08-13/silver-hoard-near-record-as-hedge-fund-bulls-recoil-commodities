At a time when  hedge funds  are the
least bullish on silver in almost four years, investors’
holdings are near a record, siding with the analysts predicting
a rally as central banks move to bolster growth.  Speculators cut bets on higher prices by 72 percent since
the end of February, mirroring changes in their copper wagers,
which turned bearish in May, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. Silver held in exchange-traded products
climbed for three months and is now valued at $16.2 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prices will average
$33.02 an ounce in the fourth quarter, 18 percent more than now,
the median of 13 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Hedge funds anticipate slowing growth will curb demand for
silver, 53 percent of which is used in products from televisions
to batteries. Investors and analysts are bullish on expectations
central banks will do more to stimulate economies, expanding
consumption and increasing the allure of precious metals as a
store of value. Prices tripled as the  Federal Reserve  bought
$2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called quantitative
easing from December 2008 to June 2011.  “Since the beginning of the year it has reacted more like
a base metal than a precious one,” said Frederique Dubrion, the
Geneva-based president and chief investment officer of Blue Star
Advisors SA, which manages metals and energy assets. “The main
negatives are still in industry. We’re waiting for more
quantitative easing, and that would be really positive.”  Comex Bourse  After tumbling 29 percent in the four months to the end of
June, silver is now little changed for the year at $27.76 on
the Comex bourse in  New York . The LMEX index of six industrial
metals from aluminum to zinc fell 5.2 percent as gold advanced
2.5 percent. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities
rose 1.6 percent since the start of January and the  MSCI (MXWD)  All-
Country World Index of equities gained 8 percent. Treasuries
returned 2.1 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Silver is the most volatile metal tracked by Bloomberg and
the price swings are masking what are already historically high
prices. While the metal is trading 44 percent below the 31-year
high of $49.845 set in April 2011, it averaged $30.37 since the
start of January, on track for the second-highest annual level
after last year’s $35.27. The two-decade average is $9.97.  For  Coeur d’Alene Mines Corp. , which gets about 65 percent
of its revenue from extracting the metal, that will mean a 35
percent jump in profit to a record in 2012, according to the
mean of six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Interest Rates  Industrial demand for silver may strengthen as economic
growth accelerates. The  International Monetary Fund  said July 16
it expects the global economy to expand 3.9 percent next year,
from 3.5 percent in 2012. The  European Central Bank  and the
Federal Reserve are already holding  interest rates  at record
lows and the People’s Bank of  China  cut rates in June and July,
the first reductions since 2008.  They may need to do more to bolster growth because U.S.
factory output contracted in July for a second month, the
 Institute for Supply Management  said Aug. 1. Manufacturing in
the euro area shrank for a 12th consecutive month, a Markit
Economics report showed the same day. China’s industrial-output
growth was the slowest in three years in July, according to
government data released Aug. 9.  Silver imports by China, the second-biggest user after the
U.S., declined for three consecutive months through June,
customs data show. Global fabrication demand, a measure that
includes coins, jewelry and photographic film, will be little
changed in 2013, Barclays Plc estimates. The bank expects supply
to beat consumption for a fifth year, leaving a glut of 4,148
tons as mine production expands to a record 25,835 tons.  ‘The Gap’  “Industrial demand may remain weak at least for another
six months,” said Jochen Hitzfeld from UniCredit SpA in Munich,
the fourth most-accurate precious metals forecaster tracked by
Bloomberg in the past two years. “This makes the gap that
investors have to absorb even higher,” said the analyst, who
anticipates a fourth-quarter average of $28.  Investors bought 797 tons through silver-backed ETPs this
year and now hold 18,093 tons, equal to more than eight months
of global mine output, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They
sold a net 812 tons from ETPs last year. Total assets are now
2.9 percent below the record 18,639 tons reached in April 2011.
Investors probably will buy another 500 tons in 2013, Barclays
and Morgan Stanley predict.  There are also signs that industrial demand is improving.
Stockpiles in warehouses monitored by Comex fell 6.5 percent
since July 3, reaching a four-month low on Aug. 8, bourse data
show. Inventories had expanded every month since November to
147.1 million ounces (4,575 tons), the most since 1997.  More Bullish  Hedge funds may be getting more bullish, more than doubling
their net-long position, or bet on higher prices, to 9,323
futures and options in the two weeks to Aug. 7, CFTC data show.
That’s still 58 percent below the five-year average. Wagers fell
to 2,888 contracts on June 26, the lowest since October 2008.  Options traders are divided. The most widely held contract
confers the right to buy silver at $50 by November 2013 and the
next two biggest allow holders to sell metal at $20 by the same
time and November 2012, Comex data show. The five biggest gold
options are all for purchases at prices higher than today.  Some investors may be deterred by silver’s price swings.
The 100-day historical volatility for futures is at 30.8
percent, more than in gold, platinum, palladium and the main
industrial metals traded on the  London  Metal Exchange, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Analyst Forecasts  Coeur d’Alene will report net income of $126.6 million this
year, from $93.5 million in 2011, the analyst estimates show.
Shares of the Coeur d’Alene, Idaho-based company slid 18 percent
to $19.80 this year. They will rally 35 percent to $26.74 in 12
months, according to the average of seven analyst forecasts.  Pan American Silver Corp. (PAAS) , based in  Vancouver , will make
$302.5 million next year, from $234.8 million in 2012, the mean
of six analyst estimates shows. Shares of the company, which got
51 percent of its revenue from silver in 2011, fell 28 percent
to $15.64 in New York trading since the start of January. They
will rise 45 percent to $22.63 in the next 12 months, the
average of 14 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Fed policy makers pledged to do more if needed on Aug. 1
and ECB President  Mario Draghi  said July 26 he would do whatever
it takes to preserve the 17-nation euro. Lower interest rates
increase the allure of precious metals because they generally
earn investors returns only through price gains.  “People like me who have tremendous confidence in silver
and are invested in the market see it rising once the easing
begins,” said Jeffrey Sica, the Morristown, New Jersey-based
president of SICA Wealth Management, who helps oversee about $1
billion of assets. “I expect an acceleration in the fear trade.
Most of the hedge funds who sold will be back once the market
gathers momentum.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
