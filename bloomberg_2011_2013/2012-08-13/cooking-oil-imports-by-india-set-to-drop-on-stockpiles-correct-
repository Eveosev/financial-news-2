(Corrects data timing in second paragraph.)  Cooking-oil purchases by  India , the
world’s biggest consumer after  China , probably fell for the
second straight month in July after refiners slowed purchases to
pare domestic stockpiles.  Shipments slid 4.2 percent to 875,000 metric tons last
month from 913,179 tons a year earlier, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five processors and brokers.
Imports of crude and refined  palm oil  declined to 600,000 tons
from 619,322 tons, the survey showed. The  Solvent Extractors’
Association of India  will publish shipment data this week.  Reduced imports by India, the world’s biggest palm oil
buyer, may swell inventories in  Malaysia  that climbed to a five-
month high in July. Futures have slumped 21 percent from a 13-
month high in April on speculation that demand may wane due to a
slowdown in China and the  European debt crisis .  “The market is already over supplied,” said Nagaraj Meda,
chairman of Hyderabad-based Transgraph Consulting Pvt. “In the
festival season, we might not see any considerable surge in
demand as food inflation is very high and Indian rural
consumption is likely to take a beating due to crop failure in
many states.”  Palm oil for September delivery rose 0.6 percent to 2,882
ringgit ($924) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange on
Aug. 10. The most-active contract rose to a 13-month high of
3,628 ringgit on April 10.  Festival Demand      “The time of stocking up for festivals is gone as palm oil
is available round the year and international prices are also
not too high,”  Atul Chaturvedi , chief executive officer at
Adani Wilmar Ltd., said by phone.  Imports between August and October may be around 850,000
tons to 900,000 tons a month, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief
executive officer of the Sunvin Group. The peak demand season in
India is between August and November.  A surge in imports this year lifted cooking-oil inventories
including those at ports to a record 1.7 million tons in May,
according to the extractors’ association. Stockpiles may be
about 1.6 million tons as of Aug. 1, Bajoria said.  Shipments in the eight months through June jumped 25
percent to 6.4 million tons, according to the extractors’
association. India bought 8.7 million tons in 2010-2011.
Vegetable-oil purchases in 2012-2013 may exceed the 9.5 million
tons estimated for this year as the worst monsoon since 2009
curb oilseed planting, B.V. Mehta,  executive director  at the
extractors’ association, said on July 31.  The area under oilseeds including soybeans and peanuts fell
to 15.2 million hectares as of Aug. 9 from 15.8 million hectares
a year earlier, according to the farm ministry.  Crude  soybean-oil  imports probably fell to 125,000 tons in
July from 163,650 tons a year earlier, while sunflower-oil
purchases may be unchanged at 100,000 tons, the survey showed.  Palm oil comprises almost 80 percent of India’s cooking-oil
imports. The nation buys palm from Indonesia and Malaysia, and
soybean oil from Brazil and  Argentina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
