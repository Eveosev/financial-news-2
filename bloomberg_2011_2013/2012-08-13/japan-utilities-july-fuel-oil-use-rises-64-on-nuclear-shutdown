Japan ’s 10 regional power companies
increased consumption of fuel-oil in July as the country’s
reliance on thermal generation rose due to the shutdown of
nuclear power plants after the Fukushima disaster.  Power companies, including Tokyo Electric Power Co., the
owner of the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station, used
1.25 million kiloliters, according to data released today by the
Federation of Electric Power Companies. The 10 utilities
consumed 761,670 kiloliters of fuel oil a year ago and 1.18
million kiloliters in June, according to the group.  The operation rate for nuclear plants increased to 2.9
percent from zero in June as Kansai Electric Power Co. started
two reactors at its Ohi nuclear power plants in July. Japan’s
remaining 48 reactors remain shut for maintenance and safety
checks after the meltdown and radiation leaks at the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi plant in March 2011 caused safety concerns.  The following table shows Japanese utilities’ consumption
and purchases of  fuel-oil , crude, LNG and coal for July. Fuel
oil and crude volumes are in kiloliters, while those for LNG and
coal are in tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
