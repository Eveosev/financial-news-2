The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment rose, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  increased 1 basis point to 149.5 as of
8:27 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The gauge decreased 9.5 basis points last week to 147.5,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index advanced 2 basis points
to 157 as of 10:31 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) 
prices show. The measure fell 10 basis points last week to
156.7, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 1 basis point to 185
as of 9:30 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark is set for the lowest close since Aug. 1, CMA prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
