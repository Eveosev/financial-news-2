Westfield Group (WDC)  and Westfield Retail
Trust said they are in talks with  AMP Ltd. (AMP)  after the Australian
newspaper reported the companies plan to divide up some A$6
billion ($6.3 billion) of jointly-held assets.  The groups are in confidential negotiations regarding a
proposed asset reallocation of shopping center interests, the
two property trusts said in separate statements to the
Australian stock exchange today. No binding arrangements have
been reached, they said.  The assets include at least six of  Australia ’s largest
shopping centers, the Australian newspaper said Aug. 11, citing
unidentified sources. AMP will acquire the stakes it doesn’t
already own in the Macquarie Centre in Sydney, Pacific Fair on
the Gold Coast and Booragoon in Perth. Westfield and the retail
trust it manages will take over full ownership of Warringah Mall
in Sydney, Knox City in Melbourne and Mount Gravatt in Brisbane,
the newspaper said.  AMP has a 21 percent interest in the 25 Australian and New
Zealand shopping malls that Westfield Group and  Westfield Retail
Trust (WRT)  own with outside partners, according to a regulatory
filing in February by the retail trust.  To contact the reporter on this story:
