Bulgari SpA sued Kenneth Jay Lane
Inc., saying the  New York  jewelry designer copies and imitates
its rings and bracelets without permission.  Rome-based Bulgari accused  Kenneth Jay Lane , in a complaint
filed yesterday in federal court in Manhattan, of copyright
infringement, design patent infringement and unfair competition.
The company, a unit of  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) ,
seeks a court order to end the sale of allegedly infringing
jewelry and unspecified damages.  “Bulgari’s jewelry items consist of distinctive and
original designs, including design elements and features that
have become synonymous with Bulgari in the eyes of the public,
consumers and the luxury goods industry,” the Italian company
said in the complaint.  Jonathan Wolfert, a lawyer who represents Kenneth Jay Lane
in a separate trademark infringement case, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail or telephone call to his office seeking comment
on the Bulgari lawsuit.  The case is Bulgari v. Kenneth Jay Lane, 12-cv-6194, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
