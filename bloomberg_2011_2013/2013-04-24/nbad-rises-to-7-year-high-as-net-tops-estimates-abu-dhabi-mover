National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC 
jumped to the highest level in more than seven years after
quarterly profit at the second-biggest lender in the United Arab
Emirates beat analysts’ estimates.  The  shares climbed  as much as 8.1 percent to 12 dirhams,
the highest since January 2006, valuing the state-controlled
bank at 51 billion dirhams ($14 billion). The benchmark  ADX
General Index (ADSMI)  rose 1.2 percent at 11:33 a.m. in the emirate.  First-quarter profit climbed to 1.41 billion dirhams from
1.04 billion dirhams as operating income advanced 24 percent.
The mean estimate of five analysts was for a profit of 1.1
billion dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The bank reported strong results that showed growth on
all aspects: operational profits, deposits and other aspects,”
said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer
Securities.  Operational income advanced to 2.51 billion dirhams from
2.03 billion dirhams a year earlier. Deposits increased to 206
billion dirhams at the end of first quarter from 190 billion
dirhams at the end of last year.  The stock’s  14-day relative strength index  rose to 81
today. A reading above 70 indicates to some analysts that a
security or index is poised to decline. One analyst has a buy
rating on the stock, 11 say hold and one says sell, according to
 data compiled by Bloomberg.   To contact the reporter on this story:
