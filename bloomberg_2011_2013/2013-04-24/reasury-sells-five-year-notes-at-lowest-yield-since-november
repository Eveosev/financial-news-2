The U.S. Treasury sold $35 billion
of five-year notes at the lowest yield since November as slowing
global growth and speculation the  European Central Bank  is
considering an interest-rate cut bolstered demand.  The notes were sold yesterday at a so-called  high yield  of
0.710 percent, the least since the Nov. 28 auction. The  bid-to-
cover  ratio, which gauges demand for the issue by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.86, the
first increase at the monthly sales since January. The ratio
averaged 2.81 at the past 10 auctions.  “It was a very good auction,” said  Ray Remy , head of
fixed income in  New York  at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc.
“It could be concerns about  Europe  or chances of the European
Central Bank easing monetary policy next week.”  The ECB will cut its key rate to 0.5 percent, from 0.75
percent on May 2, according to a survey of banks by  Bloomberg
News . Economists forecast a reduction for May after gauges of
manufacturing and services activity for April underscored
weakness in output.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks,  bought  43.6 percent of the U.S. five-year
notes yesterday, compared with 46.1 percent at the March sale,
the most since April 2012. The average for the past 10 sales is
40.7 percent.  Bids Awarded  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14 percent of
the securities, the lowest since September and compared with
16.8 percent at last month’s auction of the notes. The average
at the past 10 auctions is 14.7 percent.  Primary dealers  purchased 42.4 percent of the notes at the
sale, compared with 37.1 percent at last month’s sale.  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$702 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $2.98 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, data released by the Treasury and compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Five-year notes have gained 0.6 percent this year, compared
with a 0.7 percent return by Treasuries overall, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-year securities
returned 2.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall advanced
2.2 percent.  The sales this week will raise $59.05 billion of new cash,
as maturing securities held by the public total $57.95 billion,
according to the  U.S. Treasury .  The U.S. is scheduled to auction $29 billion of seven-year
debt today, the last of three note sales this week totaling $99
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
