West Texas Intermediate crude was
little changed near its highest closing level in two weeks amid
signs of stronger gasoline demand. The benchmark’s discount to
Brent shrank to less than $10 a barrel, the lowest in 15 months.  Futures pared an earlier increase of as much as 0.6 percent
in New York after Spanish  unemployment  rose more than economists
forecast in the first quarter. The U.S. Energy Department said
yesterday that  gasoline inventories  shrank by 3.93 million
barrels last week, the most in a year and a bigger contraction
than the 600,000-barrel drop estimated in a Bloomberg survey.  “It looks like the market is seeking to consolidate,”
said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London.
“Things will get more interesting ahead of the summer driving
season as refinery rates gain.”  WTI for June delivery rose as much as 55 cents to $91.98 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and was at $91.63 at 1:16 p.m. London time. The volume of all
futures traded was 1.8 percent below the 100-day average. The
contract climbed $2.25 to $91.43 a barrel yesterday, the highest
settlement since April 11. Prices are little changed this year.  Brent for June settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange gained 25 cents to $101.98 a barrel. The
European benchmark crude’s premium to WTI contracts shrank to as
little as $9.94 a barrel today. The spread was last less than
$10 a barrel on Jan. 26.  Spanish  unemployment  climbed to the highest in at least 37
years as efforts to tackle the European Union’s biggest  budget
deficit  crimped growth.  Spanish Unemployment  The number of jobless increased to more than 6 million for
the first time, climbing to 27.2 percent of the workforce,
compared with 26.02 percent in the previous three months, the
National Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said today. That was
more than the 26.5 percent median forecast of 8 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg News.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles decreased to 217.8 million barrels
in the week ended April 19, according to the Energy Department.
Supplies fell for the 10th time in 11 weeks even as imports
rebounded and refineries produced more of the fuel.  WTI’s advance may stall along its 200-day moving average,
around $91.73 a barrel today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures yesterday halted an intraday climb near this
indicator, signaling it is where sell orders are probably
clustered. A breach of chart resistance typically means a rally
may continue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
