Brazil ’s swap rates dropped to an
11-week low on speculation central bank minutes due tomorrow
will show policy makers will limit borrowing cost increases.  Swap rates due in July 2017 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 8.94 percent at 10:22 a.m. in Sao Paulo,
the lowest level on a closing basis since Feb. 1. The real
gained less than 0.1 percent to 2.0223 per dollar.  “It seems clear that there’s a disinflationary bias in the
global environment,” Octavio de Barros, the chief economist at
Bradesco Bradesco SA, said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“I see the minutes leaving the door open for a total adjustment
possibly smaller than the 100 basis points we priced in.”  Swap rates tumbled on April 18, the day after the central
bank raised borrowing costs less than some analysts had
forecast. Board members voted 6 to 2 to increase the target
lending  rate  by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent from a record
low 7.25 percent. A survey by Bloomberg showed that 18 of 58
analysts had forecast an increase of 50 basis points.  Policy makers said in their statement that “the high level
of inflation” and “resilience of inflation” required a
response tempered by the central bank’s recognition that
“external uncertainties” also required “that monetary policy
be managed with caution.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
