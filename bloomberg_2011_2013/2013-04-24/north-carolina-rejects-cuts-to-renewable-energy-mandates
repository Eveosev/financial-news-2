North Carolina  lawmakers today
rejected efforts to scale back the use of renewable energy.  The House Public Utilities Committee voted 18 to 13 against
the Affordable & Reliable Energy Act, said Ivan Urlaub,
executive director of NC Sustainable Energy Association, which
has been fighting the effort to reduce policies that require
utilities to use power generated from clean sources.  North Carolina is one of 16 states considering legislation
to roll back renewable-energy requirements, more than half of
the 29 states that have implemented so-called renewable
portfolio standards.  “Legislators are understanding the economic benefits of
clean energy,” Urlaub said in an e-mail.  The legislation voted down today would have capped
utilities’ required purchases of renewable energy at 6 percent
of demand in 2015, half the current target, and eliminate the
requirement in 2021. It was opposed by Representative Ruth
Samuelson, a committee member whose legislative assitant
confirmed the vote count in a phone interview today.  Being rejected by the committe means the bill is unlikely
to advance, House Majority Whip Mike Hager said before the vote.
Hager, a Republican who chairs the committee and introduced the
bill, didn’t immediately respond to a voicemail left at his
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
