KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC) , a Kenyan fuel
retailer operating in 10 countries, fell to the lowest in more
than 16 months over uncertainty about the company’s plans to
sell assets to recapitalize, Standard Investment Bank Ltd. said.  The stock fell 7.6 percent to 9.10 shillings by the close
in Nairobi, the lowest since Dec. 15, 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. About 5.7 million shares were traded, or
7.8 times the three-month daily average.  After the company swung to a loss of 6.28 billion shillings
($75 million) in 2012, Managing Director  Jacob Segman  said on
April 8 that KenolKobil “recently put up for sale some of the
group’s under-performing and non-performing assets.” The move
is meant to reduce borrowing and finance costs, he said in a
statement. No further details have been given.  “There is uncertainty on how they intend to dispose of
some assets to recapitalize,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank said by phone today.
“It’s not clear if they will sell some assets or non-performing
subsidiaries, when and how it will be done,” he said.  KenolKobil didn’t declare a dividend. The shares have
fallen 33 percent this year, the worst-performing stock on the
 Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share Index (NSEASI) , which has gained 24
percent during the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
