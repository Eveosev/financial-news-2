Cox Communications Inc., the U.S.
cable provider, issued $1.5 billion of bonds in its second sale
in five months to help fund shareholder dividends.  The company’s $1 billion of 2.95 percent, 10-year
securities yield 130 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and its $500 million of 4.5 percent, 30-year debt
pays a relative yield of 160 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used to help fund a $1.5
billion dividend and for debt repayment, according to a person
familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be identified
citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  The unit of Cox Enterprises Inc. raised $1.5 billion in
November, also for a dividend and debt repayment, selling $1
billion of 3.25 percent, 10-year notes at a spread of 160 basis
points and $500 million of 4.7 percent, 30-year securities at
190 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  The new bonds are expected to be rated Baa2 by Moody’s
Investors Service, Bloomberg data show. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
 Wells Fargo & Co . managed the offering for the Atlanta-based
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
