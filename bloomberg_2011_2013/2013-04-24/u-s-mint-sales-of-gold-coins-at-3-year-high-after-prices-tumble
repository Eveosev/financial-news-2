Sales of gold coins by the  U.S.
Mint  are heading for the highest level since December 2009 after
prices in New York had the worst two-day slump in three decades.  As of yesterday, sales totaled 196,500 ounces, up from
62,000 ounces in March, data on the mint’s website show. The
amount for all of December 2009 was 231,500 ounces.  Consumers from the U.S. to  Australia  joined shoppers from
 China  and  India  to buy jewelry, coins and bars after futures
slumped 13 percent in two days through April 15. Sales by the
Perth Mint in Australia doubled and retail purchases across
China tripled, the China Gold Association said. The U.S. Mint
said April 23 it suspended sales of coins weighing a 10th of an
ounce after demand more than doubled from a year earlier.  “The crash in prices has provoked huge new interest in
physical bullion,” Miguel Perez-Santalla, a vice president at
New York-based BullionVault, said in a phone interview. “Our
business last week was 250 percent more than a week before.”  Gold futures on the Comex in New York climbed as much as
1.7 percent to $1,448.50 an ounce today, the highest level since
April 15, and traded recently at $1,444.50. Prices are down 25
percent from the record $1,923.70 in September 2011.  The U.S. Mint sells 22-karat  American Eagles  of 1 ounce for
$1,760 each on its website. A half-ounce coin costs $895, a
quarter-ounce coin is $460 and one weighing a 10th of an ounce
is $195. The cost for a 1-ounce coin can vary weekly, depending
on the average price at the  London  “fixing,” used by some
mining companies to sell output, the mint said on its  website .  “The 1-ounce gold bullion coins are the most popular,”
Michael White, a Mint spokesman, said yesterday.  Maple Leaf  Demand continues to be very strong for the Maple Leaf coins
from the Canadian Mint, Chris Carkner, a managing director at
the mint, said in an e-mailed response to questions from
Bloomberg. “Demand has increased from all our markets,
including North America,  Europe  and Asia,” he said.  The Perth Mint has seen an “enormous number of people”
buying gold, Treasurer Nigel Moffatt said on Bloomberg
Television April 19. There was interest from India,  Thailand  and
particularly from China, he said.  UBS AG said on April 23 that physical-gold flows to India,
the world’s biggest buyer, approached the highest since 2008,
while Standard Chartered Plc said shipments last week were 20
percent above the previous record.  Volumes of gold products sold jumped 150 percent in Hong
Kong and Macau during the April 13 weekend compared with the
weekend before, Dennis Lau, director of sales operations at  Chow
Sang Sang Holdings International Ltd. (116) , said last week. Retail
sales tripled across China on April 15-16, the China Gold
Association reported.  Japanese consumers are poised to become net buyers of gold
for the first time in eight years as the yen’s decline and
looming inflation drive them to seek refuge in bullion,
according to Standard Bank Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
