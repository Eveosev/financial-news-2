Air New Zealand Ltd. (AIR) , the nationâ€™s
largest carrier, rose the most in seven months after forecasting
full-year earnings will surge by more than it earlier projected.  Normalized earnings before tax will be between NZ$235
million ($198 million) and NZ$260 million in the year ending
June 30, from NZ$91 million a year earlier, the Auckland-based
airline said in a statement today. The shares rose 4.9 percent,
headed for the biggest gain since Sept. 28.  The outlook is based on the current market conditions and
trading environment, the airline said without providing any
other comment. Passenger numbers rose 2.4 percent in the nine
months ended March 31, it said in a monthly disclosure of
statistics, also released today.  Air  New Zealand  shares have jumped 22 percent the past six
months after it said in late September that full-year earnings
would more than double. The  stock  rose 7 New Zealand cents today
to NZ$1.51 at 12:14 p.m. in Wellington.  First-half earnings were NZ$139 million, the most in five
years, the company said Feb. 28, adding that it expected second-
half earnings would comfortably exceed the NZ$58 million
recorded a year earlier.  Air New Zealand only provides forecasts based on pretax
profit that excludes gains and losses on derivatives that hedge
exposures in other financial periods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
