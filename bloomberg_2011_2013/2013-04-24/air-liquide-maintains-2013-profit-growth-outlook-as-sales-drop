Air Liquide SA (AI) , the French maker of
industrial gases, reiterated its forecast for profit growth in
2013 after saying that first-quarter sales dropped on exchange
rates and natural gas prices.  Revenue fell 2.1 percent to 3.7 billion euros ($4.81
billion), the Paris-based company said today in a statement. The
average  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of six analysts was 3.90
billion euros. Sales of gas and services, excluding the effects
of natural-gas prices, currency shifts, calendar effects,
customer settlements paid a year earlier, and acquisitions or
disposals, increased 4.9 percent.  “In an economic environment that remains contrasted, the
first quarter saw the pursuit of growth investments and an
increase in our underlying growth in Gas and Services,” Chief
Executive Officer Benoit Potier said. “Barring a degradation of
the environment, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to
deliver another year of net profit growth in 2013.”  The CEO has said he will unveil a strategy this December to
manage the challenges of  Europe ’s economic woes, growing
industrial capacity in  emerging markets , cheaper U.S. gas, and
rising demand for health-care services and electronic goods such
as tablets. In February, the group raised its savings target for
the period from 2011 to 2015 by 30 percent to 1.3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
