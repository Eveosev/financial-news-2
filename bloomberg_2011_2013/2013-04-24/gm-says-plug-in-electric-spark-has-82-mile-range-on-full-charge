General Motors Co. (GM) , which
introduced the Volt in 2010, said its 2014 Chevrolet Spark plug-
in can travel 82 miles (132 kilometers) when fully charged, in
its latest attempt to attract new customers for green cars.  The battery-only vehicle’s combination of range and miles-
per-gallon equivalent, or MPGe, represent an “industry
benchmark in retail electric vehicle efficiency,” according to
a statement today from Detroit-based GM. A Spark allows drivers
to travel the equivalent of 119 miles per gallon in combined
city and highway conditions, according to EPA estimates.  Drivers reluctant to switch to a plug-in or a hybrid are
more likely to be swayed as ranges and efficiencies keep
increasing, giving them more options, Pam Fletcher, GM’s
executive chief engineer for electrified vehicles, said in an
interview. “It’s all about broader adoption -- it’s about how
do you get the people who aren’t even on the fence yet.”  The Spark can be fully refueled in about seven hours using
a 240-volt charger and soon will be capable of receiving direct-
current fast charges that in 20 minutes can refill as much as 80
percent of the vehicle’s battery capacity, according to the
statement.  Fiat SpA (F) ’s 2014 500e model has an EPA-approved range of 87
miles and averages 116 MPGe, compared with 75 miles and 115 MPGe
for the 2013  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  Leaf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
