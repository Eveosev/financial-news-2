Iceland’s Supreme Court ordered
Valitor hf, the Icelandic partner of  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  and  Visa
Inc. (V) , to process card payments for anti-secrecy website
WikiLeaks within 15 days or face daily penalties.  If the company fails to comply it will be forced to pay
800,000 kronur ($6,800) in daily penalties, according to the
ruling posted on the Reykjavik-based court’s  website  today.  The court also said Valitor must honor a contract with
Icelandic data-hosting service provider DataCell. The payment
card company had refused to process payments for DataCell
because DataCell had signed a contract to process payments for
WikiLeaks.  Valitor’s refusal to process WikiLeaks payments “shall be
considered baseless,” according to the ruling posted on the
Reykjavik-based court’s website. Valitor “is required to open a
payment portal in accordance with its cooperation agreement”
with DataCell.  Valitor Chief Executive Officer Vidar Thorkelsson didn’t
immediately respond to a call for comment after regular business
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
