Japanese  shares  gained, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rising to its highest since 2008, after
the yen weakened in overnight trading, boosting the outlook for
exporters as earnings season starts.  JFE Holdings Inc. jumped 6.6 percent after the steelmaker
posted a 28-fold jump in fourth-quarter profit, helped by a
weaker yen and cost cuts. Tosoh Corp. surged for a second day
after the chemical producer’s net income was double its
forecast. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker,
gained 2 percent.  Fujitsu (6702)  Ltd. dropped the most on the Nikkei
225 after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its outlook on the stock.  The Nikkei 225 added 2.3 percent to close at 13,843.46 in
 Tokyo , climbing to its highest since June 2008. Volume was 20
percent above the 30-day intraday average. The  Topix Index (TPX)  rose
1.8 percent to 1,164.35, with about seven shares rising for
every each that fell on the 1,698-member gauge.  “A lot of the expectation for exporter earnings has been
priced in, but forecasts are still conservative,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui
Asset Management Co., which oversees about 10.2 trillion yen
($102 billion). “Because companies are basing their forecasts
on the assumption that the yen is near 80, we could see some big
changes for this coming year.”  The Topix advanced 61 percent since mid-November as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation. The gauge trades at 1.3
times  book value  compared with 2.3 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Nintendo, Canon  Nintendo Co. and Canon Inc. are among more than 20
companies on the Topix that report earnings today, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 69 companies that have posted
results so far this month and for which Bloomberg has estimates,
45 percent beat expectations, while 55 percent fell short, the
 data  show.  JFE, which gets about 38 percent of its revenue outside of
 Japan , jumped 6.6 percent to 2,094 yen today after reporting
17.6 billion yen in profit for the three months ended March 31,
compared with 635 million yen a year earlier after increasing
cost cutting measures.  Tosoh jumped 10 percent to 310 yen, the third biggest gain
on the Nikkei 225, extending yesterday’s 7.7 percent advance.
Tosoh said its net income of 16 billion yen for the year ended
March 31 was double its forecast, helped by the yen’s slide.  Yen  The yen fell ahead of a  Bank of Japan  policy decision on
April 26. The central bank may upgrade its outlook on consumer-
price gains excluding fresh food to at least 1.5 percent from
0.9 percent for fiscal 2014, according to people familiar with
the central bank’s discussions.  Exporters gained. Toyota, which gets 25 percent of its
sales from  North America , rose 2 percent to 5,620 yen, the
biggest boost to the Topix Index. Honda Motor Co., which gets 81
percent of its sales abroad, advanced 1.9 percent to 3,950 yen.
Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, climbed 1.3
percent to 3,840 yen.  Fujitsu declined the most on the Nikkei 225 after Goldman
Sachs reduced its investment rating on the stock to sell from
neutral.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index gained 1.1
percent to 25.64 today, indicating traders expect a swing of
about 7.4 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
