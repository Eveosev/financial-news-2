Waste recycler Synagro Technologies
Inc., which was purchased by  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  in 2007, plans to
file for bankruptcy today, Chief Executive Officer Eric Zimmer
said. The company plans to sell most of its assets to EQT
Infrastructure II.  “Operating results for the company are actually very good,
it’s just levered up too much on the balance sheet,” Zimmer
said in an interview.  The best way to address its debt is
through Chapter 11, he said.  EQT, the Sweden-based private equity firm which has agreed
to be the lead bidder at a court-supervised auction, offered a
total of about $455 million. The sale is subject to court
approval, as well as better offers.  Carlyle Group , the world’s second-biggest private-equity
firm by assets, acquired Synagro for $462 million in 2007.
Carlyle bought all of Synagro’s shares for $5.76 each in cash, a
29 percent premium over the closing price on Jan. 26, 2007, the
Washington-based firm said in a Jan. 29, 2007, statement. The
transaction including the assumption of $310 million in debt was
valued at $772 million.  Synagro, which serves municipal and industrial water and
wastewater treatment customers, contacted more than 100
potential buyers and EQT offered the highest price, Zimmer said.
The company competes in an $8 billion market and had revenue of
$320 million in 2012, he said. Its customers include the cities
of  New York , Houston, Baltimore and Honolulu, according to its
 website .  “Everything that we are doing right now has one overriding
goal and that is to make Synagro a stronger company now and for
years to come,” Zimmer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
