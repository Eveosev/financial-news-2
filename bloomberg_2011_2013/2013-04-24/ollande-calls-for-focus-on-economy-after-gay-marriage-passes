President  Francois Hollande  asked
for calm after France’s parliament approved gay marriage, and
said the focus must turn to repairing the economy.  “We must now seek serenity, understanding and respect,”
Hollande said after the government’s weekly Cabinet meeting in
Paris today. “We must now concentrate on the essential, which
is economic revival of the country and social cohesion.”  After daily protests across France -- some of which turned
violent -- lawmakers yesterday approved gay marriage and
adoption by 331 votes to 225. The French Senate approved the
bill on April 12.  While public opinion favors gay marriage, the French by a
small majority oppose same-sex adoption, polls show. Opposition
members of parliament have asked  France ’s Constitutional Court
to review the law.  France is suffering from its most severe economic
contraction since 2009, forcing Hollande to abandon his 2013
deficit target. Joblessness has surged to a 15-year high as PSA
Peugeot-Citroen SA and other manufacturers eliminate tens of
thousands of jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
