A U.K.  retail-sales index 
unexpectedly fell this month led by clothing and home-
improvement stores as cold weather deterred shoppers.  A gauge of annual sales growth slipped to minus 1 from zero
in March, the London-based Confederation of British Industry
business lobby group said today. That’s the weakest reading in
eight months. Economists had forecast an increase to 8,
according to the median of eight estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. Retailers had also expected sales to grow this month.  Data tomorrow will show whether the U.K. fell into a
triple-dip recession in the  first quarter  after the economy
shrank 0.3 percent in the previous three months.  Debenhams Plc (DEB) ,
the U.K.’s second-biggest department-store chain, said this
month that consumer sentiment remains “weak” and market
conditions are challenging.  “Retailers were frustrated this month by the ongoing
stagnation,” said Barry Williams, chief merchandising officer
for food at  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s Asda unit and head of the
CBI’s distributive trades panel. “High street conditions are
tricky with consumers lacking the confidence to go out and
spend.”  A gauge of the volume of orders placed with suppliers
dropped to minus 12 in April from minus 1 in March. A measure of
sales volumes for the time of year fell to minus 27 from minus
20. Retailers expect the volume of sales to decline again in
May, according to the report.  The CBI’s survey of 62 retailers was conducted between
March 26 and April 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
