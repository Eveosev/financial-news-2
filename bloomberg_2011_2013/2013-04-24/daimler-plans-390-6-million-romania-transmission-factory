Daimler AG (DAI) , the third-biggest maker
of luxury cars, will invest more than 300 million euros ($390.6
million) adding transmission production in  Romania  after
reaching full capacity at its main German plant.  Daimler will begin assembling five-speed automatic
transmissions in mid-2013 at a new plant in the town of Sebes,
close to an existing parts factory in Cugir, the Stuttgart-based
company said in a statement today. The new site will start
production of front dual-clutch transmissions in 2014 and add
capacity for the next generation of drivetrains in 2016.  The German company, which has been producing parts for
engines and transmissions in Romania at a joint venture since
2001, is adding capacity across eastern Europe as the Mercedes-
Benz brand expands its line-up of compact cars. Daimler opened
an 800-million-euro car factory last year in Kecskemet,  Hungary ,
where it makes the Mercedes B-Class and CLA compacts.  Chief Executive Officer  Dieter Zetsche  has vowed to regain
the top spot in global luxury-vehicle sales by the end of the
decade and plans to boost the operating margin at the carmaking
unit to 10 percent of sales. First-quarter earnings before
interest and taxes at the Mercedes-Benz Cars division, which
also includes the Smart city car brand, dropped 63 percent to
460 million euros, resulting in a 3.3 percent margin, the
company said today.  Further development of the Sebes plant is subject to
backing from the Romanian government, Daimler said. The carmaker
isnâ€™t able to expand transmission production at its Stuttgart
site because of space limitations, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
