The number of European gasoline
cargoes booked for shipment to the U.S. will almost double over
the next two weeks as seasonal demand for the road fuel
strengthens, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Traders will charter a total of 34 Medium Range tankers for
loading to May 7, according to the median in a survey yesterday
of seven shipbrokers and traders. That’s up from 18 vessels,
each normally carrying 37,000 metric tons of cargo, in a
corresponding survey last week.  U.S. demand for gasoline usually peaks during the so-called
driving season between the Memorial Day holiday in late May and
Labor Day in early September. Inventories of the fuel in the
world’s biggest economy declined for a ninth week in 10 as of
April 12, according to data from the U.S. Department of Energy.  “There’s a seasonal upturn in the need for gasoline ahead
of the U.S. summer driving season,” Gareth Lewis-Davies, a
London-based energy strategist at BNP Paribas SA, said by
telephone yesterday.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles were down 5.6 percent from this
year’s high in January at 221.7 million barrels by April 12, the
Department of Energy’s figures showed.  Tankers were  earning  $19,277 daily on the trans-Atlantic
voyage as of yesterday, the most since Feb. 13, according to
figures from the  Baltic Exchange  in  London . Returns jumped 60
percent this year, its data showed.  Eighteen of the projected charters have been arranged and
the rest are anticipated, according to the survey. About 33
vessels will be seeking cargoes, five more than last week.  The survey is based on the industry’s benchmark Rotterdam-
to-New York route. The voyage takes about 11 days at 12.5 knots,
according to the sea-distances.com website. Below is a table of
ships chartered, probably hired and available to be booked for
the trans-Atlantic voyage loading over the two-week periods from
the dates shown.  *T                             April 23       April 16   Change
