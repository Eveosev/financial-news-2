Mid Europa Partners LLP, a private
equity firm, said it expects growth of its Western Balkan
providers of cable and satellite TV, internet and fixed phones,
as it formed a new unit to jointly run the operations.  Last year’s combined revenue of 180 million euros ($234
million) of Serbia BroadBand, Telemach units in Slovenia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Total TV  and more than a dozen smaller units
in the region may grow by at least 20 million euros annually on
organic growth and possible acquisition, said Dragica Pilipovic-
Chaffey, SBB’s chief executive officer.  Mid Europa announced it formed United Group in Luxembourg
to consolidate the units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
