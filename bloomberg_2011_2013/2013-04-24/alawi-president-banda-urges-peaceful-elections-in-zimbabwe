Zimbabwe must hold peaceful
elections this year to ensure regional stability, Malawian
President Joyce Banda said while on a trip to Zimbabwe.  Banda hoped the elections will be conducted in a free, fair
and transparent manner, as seen during a referendum last month,
she said at a banquet hosted by Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe  yesterday.  “It is my sincere hope that the same spirit will prevail
during the harmonized elections, which this country is planning
later this year,” Banda said. “The political and economic
stability of this nation is of critical importance to Malawi and
indeed the entire region, as we put our efforts together to
integrate our economies.”  Zimbabweans endorsed a new constitution during a referendum
that was held last month. The south African country will hold
elections later this year, with no date yet set.  The event was also attended by Zimbabwean Prime Minister
 Morgan Tsvangirai  and diplomats from  Africa  and western nations.
Banda is on a five-day state visit to  Zimbabwe , which is
Malawi’s second-largest trading partner in the region, according
to the president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
