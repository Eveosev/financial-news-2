The European Central Bank said
euro-area countries that are currently enjoying economic growth
need to prevent wages and prices from rising too quickly.  “Excessive wage increments and a strong surge in prices
need to be avoided in the more competitive countries, also
during this transition phase, as they would harm real growth and
lead to higher unemployment,” the ECB said in its annual report
published today.  IG Metall,  Germany ’s largest labor union, is seeking pay
increases of 5.5 percent for 3.7 million engineering and metal
workers at companies including Siemens AG and Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG this year. That and similar deals in recent months
contrast with years of wage restraint as Germany enacted labor-
market reforms that helped push down unemployment and turned the
economy,  Europe ’s largest, into the region’s growth engine.  “Several of the euro-area economies that increased their
competitiveness prior to the crisis are likely to grow faster
and temporarily experience wage and price increases above the
euro-area average,” the ECB said.  Countries seeking to regain competitiveness in the
aftermath of the crisis “will need to take further ambitious
measures,” the ECB said. “A significant genuine reduction in
unit labor costs and profit margins, where a lack of competition
is apparent, is particularly urgent in countries where high
unemployment rates risk becoming structural and where
competition is weak.”  ECB President Mario Draghi, in a foreword to the annual
report, said that while 2012 had been a “challenging year” for
the conduct of monetary policy, inflation expectations remain
firmly anchored.  “The reintensification of the euro-area sovereign debt
crisis in the first half of 2012 revealed a clear need for
countries to better and more closely coordinate their economic,
fiscal and financial policies to avoid unsustainable
developments in individual countries jeopardizing the smooth
functioning of” monetary union, Draghi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
