Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles 
advanced against futures for the first time in four days after
regional stockpiles slid to a record low for the time of year.  Gasoline supplies on the West Coast, the PADD 5 region,
declined 5.6 percent to 26 million barrels in the week ended
April 19, the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, said today. That’s the lowest for
the period since at least 1990, when the agency began collecting
the data.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles gained
4.5 cents versus gasoline futures traded on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange to a premium of 10.5 cents a gallon at 1:34
p.m. New York time, the highest level in almost a week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance refinery
in  Southern California  was scheduled to shut process equipment,
including a crude unit, a coker and an alkylation unit, for
about 23 days of planned repairs in early May, a person with
knowledge of the schedule said March 5.  Carbob in San Francisco dropped 3.5 cents against futures
to a premium of 17.5 cents a gallon, the lowest level in almost
two weeks.  The hydrocracker at  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Rodeo plant near San
Francisco began producing fuel April 22 after pump repairs, a
person familiar with operations there said yesterday.  Tesoro
Corp. (TSO) ’s Golden Eagle plant finished maintenance over the
weekend, and  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Richmond complex is scheduled to
restart its crude unit by the end of the month.  Carbob Spread  Carbob in  San Francisco  narrowed by 8 cents to 7 cents a
gallon  above  the fuel in Los Angeles, the smallest spread since
April 11.  California-blend, or CARB,  diesel  in San Francisco fell for
the fifth straight day against ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures
on the Nymex, slipping 0.5 cent to a discount of 4 cents a
gallon, the lowest level since Jan. 11.  CARB  diesel  in Los Angeles dropped 0.5 cent to a discount
of 1.5 cents a gallon, a one-month low.  Distillate fuel oil stockpiles on the West Coast rose for
the third week, gaining 2 percent to 12.4 million barrels, the
EIA said.  In Portland,  Oregon ,  gasoline  advanced 3.63 cents against
Nymex futures to a premium of 7.38 cents a gallon. Diesel in
 Portland  was unchanged at a premium of 0.75 cent a gallon
against ULSD futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles widened for the
first time in four days, gaining 18 cents to $16.13 a barrel.
The spread, a rough indicator of refinery margins, is down 45
percent from this year’s high of $29.09 a barrel on Feb. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
