Asian  stocks  rose the most in two
weeks as Japanese exporters advanced after the yen weakened
overnight and higher sales of new homes in the U.S. added to
recovery signs.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a Japanese carmaker that gets 79 percent
of sales overseas, climbed 2.3 percent. Huaneng Power
International Inc. jumped 6 percent in Hong Kong to a five-year
high as the Chinese electricity producer reported profit more
than doubled. Siam Makro Pcl surged 11 percent, heading for
record close, after Billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont’s CP All Pcl
offered to pay $6.6 billion for Thailand’s biggest discount
store chain.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 1.4 percent 138.86 as of
7:45 p.m. in  Tokyo , heading for its highest close since August
2011. Almost five shares rose for each that fell on the gauge.
The measure climbed 5.8 percent this year through yesterday amid
signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering and as Japanese equities
rallied on speculation the government and central bank will
succeed in ending deflation.  “The economy in the U.S. is hitting that sweet spot where
it’s not bad enough to worry investors but not strong enough for
the  Federal Reserve  to start withdrawing stimulus,” said Stan Shamu, a markets strategist at IG Markets Ltd. in Melbourne, a
provider of trading services in currencies and equities. “It’s
positive for the global economy. There are still heightened
expectations of central-bank action.”  Weaker Yen  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 2.3 percent, the
highest close since June 2008, as the yen fell to as low as
99.77 against the  U.S. dollar , before rebounding to 99.44. The
broader Topix Index added 1.8 percent. A weaker yen boosts the
value of overseas income at Japanese exporters when repatriated.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index jumped 1.7 percent. The
nation’s consumer prices gained less than economists forecast
last quarter, allowing the central bank scope to resume
interest-rate reductions. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.5
percent after Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler kept
borrowing costs unchanged today.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1.7 percent and  China ’s
Shanghai Composite Index added 1.6 percent. South Korea’s  Kospi
index (KOSPI)  gained 0.9 percent and Taiwan’s Taiex Index rose 1
percent.  Shares on the benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at
13.9 times estimated earnings as of yesterday compared with 14.3
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.2
percent today. The gauge climbed 1 percent yesterday as earnings
from Travelers Cos. to Netflix Inc. beat estimates and new-home
sales in the U.S. rose 1.5 percent in March.  False Report  A false report of explosions at the White House wiped $136
billion from the  S&P 500  in about two minutes yesterday. The
benchmark gauge was up 1 percent at 1:07 p.m.  New York  time when
a posting on the Associated Press Twitter account said there had
been explosions at the White House and President  Barack Obama 
had been injured.  The U.S. benchmark index erased almost the entire gain,
recovering from the plunge within three minutes after the news
service said its Twitter account had been hacked and there were
no explosions.  Japanese exporters advanced. Nissan gained 2.3 percent to
1,058 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of industrial robots that gets
about half of its revenue overseas, increased 2.2 percent to
15,520 yen. Tokyo Electron Ltd., Japan’s biggest manufacturer of
chip-making equipment, jumped 5.3 percent to 5,070 yen.  Earnings Performance  “A lot of the expectation for exporter earnings has been
priced in, but forecasts are still conservative,” said  Masaru
Hamasaki , a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $102 billion.
“Because companies are basing their forecasts on the assumption
that the yen is near 80, we could see some big changes for this
coming year.”  Mitsubishi Motors Corp., the maker of Lancer passenger cars
and Pajero sports utility vehicles, surged 20 percent to 126
yen, the highest close since December 2010. The company raised
its net income forecast for the year ended March 31 to 38
billion yen ($382 billion) from 13 billion yen previously.  Of the 62 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have reported quarterly earnings since April 1 and for which
estimates are available, 52 percent exceeded expectations, while
47 percent fell short of projections, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Power Profit  Huaneng Power (902)  advanced 6 percent to HK$8.80 in Hong Kong,
the highest close since November 2007. The operator of coal-fire
 power plants  in China posted first-quarter net income of 2.55
billion  yuan  ($413 million), compared with 919.36 million yuan a
year earlier.  Siam Makro surged 11 percent to 756 baht, heading for a
record close, after CP All, which operates the 7-Eleven chain in
the country, offered to buy the company for $6.6 billion, or 787
baht a share. CP All dropped 10 percent to 39 baht.  Among stocks that fell,  Pharmaxis Ltd. (PXS)  plunged 52 percent
to 15 Australian cents, a record low, after the pharmaceutical
company said it won’t proceed with a regulatory submission for a
new drug after clinical trials were unsuccessful.  To contact the reporters on this story:
