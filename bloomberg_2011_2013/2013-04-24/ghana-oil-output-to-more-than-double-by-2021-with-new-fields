Ghana , West  Africa ’s second-biggest
economy, expects oil production to more than double to 250,000
barrels a day by 2021 as output rises at the Jubilee field and
other sites start pumping.  The country has new crude discoveries at different stages
of appraisal and development, Nana Boakye Asafu-Adjaye, chief
executive officer of the state-owned Ghana National Petroleum
Corp. known as GNPC, said in an interview in the capital, Accra,
yesterday. At the Tullow Oil Plc-operated Jubilee field, 60
kilometers (37 miles) off Ghana’s western coast, output has
averaged 110,000 barrels a day over the last three months, he
said.  In the next “five to eight years we will be spending $20
billion” to develop Jubilee and other discoveries, Asafu-Adjaye
said. Jubilee, which started output in December 2010, is Ghana’s
lone crude-exporting oil field. Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil
producer, pumped 1.8 million barrels a day in March.  Oil displaced cocoa as Ghana’s second-most valuable export
in 2012, with shipments worth $3 billion, according to the
central bank. Gold remains the country’s top foreign-currency
earner.  Kosmos Energy Ltd. (KOS)  also has a stake in the Jubilee
field, while Tullow, Kosmos and  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  are
developing the Tweneboa-Enyenra-Ntomme, or TEN, project.  “First oil from TEN could be in late 2016,” Asafu-Adjaye
said. The site may have reserves of 245 million barrels and peak
daily production is forecast at 76,000 barrels, he said.  Onshore Exploring  GNPC is also pushing exploration in the onshore Voltaian
Basin which stretches from the south to the northern part of
Ghana and covers about 40 percent of the country, Asafu-Adjaye
said.  “We have conducted field mapping and site surveying of
selected locations for slim hole drilling,” he said in a speech
yesterday. In 2011, GNPC received geophysical data on the
region.  Tullow’s shares fell 0.9 percent to 1,037 pence in  London 
yesterday, bringing the decline this year to 18 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
