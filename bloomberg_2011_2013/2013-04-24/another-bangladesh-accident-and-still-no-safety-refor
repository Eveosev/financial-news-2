Will Bangladesh's latest industrial accident renew efforts to improve the country's safety record? It should.  An eight-story building housing several garment factories  collapsed  today outside of Dhaka, killing at least 70 people and injuring about 800. This disaster comes just five months after a fire at the Tazreen garment factory killed more than 100. Since 2005, more than 700 garment workers have died in Bangladesh, according to the International Labor Rights Forum.  Garments represent about  80 percent  of manufacturing exports in Bangladesh, one of the  least developed  countries in the world. Fifty percent of the country's garment factories don't meet legally required work-safety standards, Bloomberg News reports.  As Bloomberg View has  written , the proposed Fire and Building Safety Agreement, a program involving independent factory inspections, offers a way to improve the safety of these workers. But little progress has been made getting sufficient retailers to commit to it. Companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Gap Inc. have  opposed  the agreement. (It's not yet clear for which companies the garment factories that collapsed today made clothes.)  On April 10, the International Labor Rights Forum brought Sumi Abedin, a survivor of the Tazreen fire, to Washington. Representative George Miller, a California Democrat, said in a  statement :  Neither should the ones who died today.  (Kirsten Salyer is the social media editor of Bloomberg View.
