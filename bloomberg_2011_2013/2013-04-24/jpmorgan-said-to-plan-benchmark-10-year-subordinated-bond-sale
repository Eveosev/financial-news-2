JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank by assets, sold $2 billion of 10-year subordinated
debt.  The bank issued the 3.375 percent notes due May 2023 to
yield 175 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They may be  rated  A3 by
Moody’s Investors Service, said a person familiar with the
offering, who asked not to be identified because the terms
weren’t set at the time.  Proceeds from the offering will be used for general
corporate purposes, including debt repayment, investments in its
units, redemption of securities or funding possible
acquisitions, according to a company filing today.  JPMorgan’s $750 million of 6.125 percent subordinated bonds
due June 2017 traded at 117.5 cents on the dollar on April 9 to
yield 1.79 percent, or 110 basis points more than Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
