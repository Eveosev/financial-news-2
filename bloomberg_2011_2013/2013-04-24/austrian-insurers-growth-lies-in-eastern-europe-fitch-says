Austria’s insurers, which generated
16.3 billion euros ($21.2 billion) in premiums last year, will
continue to grow faster in eastern  Europe  than in their home
market,  Fitch Ratings  said in a report.  The presence in developing markets is a “key feature” of
companies like  Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG)  and  Uniqa
Versicherungen AG (UQA)  as they benefit from higher growth rates and
lower insurance penetration in the region, Fitch said.  As a result, “the insurance sector is likely to grow
faster than other sectors” in eastern Europe, analysts Stephan
Kalb and Sebastian Herzog wrote in the report, adding that they
see “considerable long-term opportunities.”  Austrian insurers are facing declining profit at home after
the government changed tax rules and cut subsidies on life
insurance policies. Premiums in the segment fell 6.7 percent in
2012, according to the Austrian Insurance Association. VIG, the
nation’s biggest insurer, made more than half of its profit and
revenue in eastern Europe last year.  Still, “earnings from the region are set to remain
volatile” as growth drivers are developing only gradually over
time, Fitch said. In addition, obstacles come in form of local
regulation and underdeveloped sales channels, it said.  In total, premiums written will probably stabilize in 2013
as  life insurance  in Austria is likely to recover and non-life
lines continue to grow, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
