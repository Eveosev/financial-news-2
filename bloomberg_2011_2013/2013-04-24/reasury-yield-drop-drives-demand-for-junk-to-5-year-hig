Treasury yields at the lowest level
in 2013 drove demand for  junk bonds  to the most in five years as
money managers sought higher  interest rates  than they’re getting
from government debt.  The premium investors require to hold high-yield, high-risk
bonds instead of Treasuries narrowed to 4.72 percentage points
yesterday, the least since November 2007, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. Federal Reserve purchases of $85
billion of debt a month are helping depress yields and fuel
investor appetite for securities outside the sovereign market.  “The U.S. central bank will buy bonds until the end of
this year,” said Kim Youngsung, head of fixed income in  Seoul 
at Samsung Asset Management Co.,  South Korea ’s largest private
bond investor with the equivalent of $100.9 billion in assets.
“I don’t think yields are attractive. I don’t think this is the
time to invest in U.S. Treasuries.”  Benchmark 10-year  rates  were little changed at 1.7 percent
at 10 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.
The price of the 2 percent note due February 2023 was 102 22/32.
Yields touched 1.64 percent yesterday, the least since December,
approaching the record low of 1.38 percent set in July.  The Fed is buying bonds to support the economy by putting
downward pressure on borrowing costs.  Of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the central bank,
14 in a Bloomberg survey said the Fed won’t start to reduce its
bond buying until the last three months of 2013. Twelve forecast
they will end in mid-2014 or later.  The Treasury Department is scheduled to sell $35 billion of
five-year notes today. It auctioned the same amount of two-year
debt yesterday and plans to sell $29 billion of seven-year
securities tomorrow.  Treasury volatility as measured by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s  MOVE index  fell to a record 50.04 basis points
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
