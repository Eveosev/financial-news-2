Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
coalition plans to boost oversight of the KfW Group lender after
the publicly owned bank’s growth propelled it to  Germany ’s
number three position by assets.  The Frankfurt-based bank, formed in 1948 to make
development loans and that had assets of 511 billion euros ($664
billion) in 2012, is big enough to require supervision by the
 BaFin  regulator and the Bundesbank, Klaus-Peter Flosbach, a
finance spokesman for Merkel’s  Christian Democrats , said in an
e-mail today. The coalition has drawn up a bill to facilitate
better oversight, Flosbach said  The government is seeking “binding and strict”
supervision of the bank without hampering its business, said
Flosbach. “The KfW was, is and will in future be no ordinary
lending bank.”  Other state-owned lenders such Norddeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale and BayernLB are already subject to full BaFin
scrutiny. Germany’s third-biggest lender after Deutsche Bank AG
and Commerzbank AG augments its activities as a bank for
projects including improving building insulation and export
finance for small- and medium-sized companies and by acting as
an off-budget lender to the government.  Governments since the mid-1990s have temporarily “parked”
shares in state-owned assets such as  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and
 Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  at the KfW in exchange for loans that haven’t
appeared on the budget reported to the European Commission in
compliance with the euro’s rules.  The bank in 2012 bought shares on behalf of the government
in  European Aeronautic Defense and Space  Co., a transaction that
did not appear on Merkel’s budget reported to the commission.  KfW, which has some 5,000 employees, is co-owned by
Germany’s states -- with a 20 percent stake -- and the federal
government, which owns the remainder, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
