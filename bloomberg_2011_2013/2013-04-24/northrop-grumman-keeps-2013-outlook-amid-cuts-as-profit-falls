Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , the maker
of Global Hawk surveillance drones, reported first-quarter
profit that beat analysts’ estimates while maintaining its full-
year forecast amid U.S. budget cuts.  Net income from continuing operations fell 3.4 percent in
the quarter to $489 million, or $2.03 a share, compared with
$506 million, or $1.96 a share, a year earlier, the  Falls
Church , Virginia-based company said today in a statement.
 Analysts had predicted  $1.73 a share, the average of 19
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 1.5 percent to $6.1
billion.  Northrop has divested low-margin businesses such as
shipbuilding and reduced its workforce in anticipation of
 federal budget  cuts. The company reaffirmed its 2013 forecast
for profit from $6.85 to $7.15 a share made in January.  Northrop rose 3.2  percent  to close at $73.77 in  New York 
trading for the biggest single-day gain in more than nine
months.  Across-the-board budget reductions known as sequestration
began taking effect on March 1. They will strip $1.2 trillion
from national security and domestic programs over nine years
unless President  Barack Obama  and congressional Republicans
agree to replace them with a broad bipartisan budget deal.  The cuts were crafted as a penalty for failing to agree on
a deficit-reduction strategy.  Aerospace Unit  While first-quarter revenue declined, sales in the
company’s aerospace systems unit rose 4.3 percent due to more
work tied to  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 jet, the Pentagon’s
most expensive weapons system.  The company booked $1.3 billion last year for work on the
F-35 jet, according to a federal regulatory filing. The program
was protected in the president’s budget request for next year.  Lockheed, the world’s largest defense company, yesterday
said its first-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates as sales
declined 2 percent compared with the same period a year earlier.
It cautioned that the automatic budget reductions might push
2013 sales to the low end of its prior forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
