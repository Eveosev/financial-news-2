Tiger Woods  will skip next week’s
U.S. PGA Tour event in Charlotte, a tournament he won in 2007 at
the Quail Hollow Club.  Woods, who finished fourth at the Masters Tournament two
weeks ago, typically takes three weeks off after golf’s first
annual major. Due to a scheduling change, this year’s Charlotte
tournament was moved up one week.  While Woods said on his website yesterday that he will play
in the AT&T National tournament in June, an event that benefits
his charitable foundation, he didn’t mention Charlotte.  Tournament spokesman Lee Patterson, citing Woods’s agent
 Mark Steinberg , confirmed in an e-mail that Woods won’t play
next week.  The No. 1 player in the Official World Golf Ranking, Woods
has missed the 36-hole cut the past two years in Charlotte, a
tournament that attracts many of golf’s top players. Rory McIlroy, No. 2 to Woods in the ranking and the event’s 2010
winner, will play as will three-time Masters winner  Phil Mickelson .  To contact the reporter on this story:
