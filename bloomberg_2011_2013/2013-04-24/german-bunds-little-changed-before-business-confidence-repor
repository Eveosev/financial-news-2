German  government bonds  were little
changed before a report that economists said will show an index
of business confidence in the euro-regionâ€™s largest economy fell
for a second month in April.  The German 10-year yield was about eight basis points from
the  lowest  in almost nine months. An index of business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, declined to 106.2
from 106.7 in March, the Ifo institute in Munich will say today,
according to the median estimate of 44 analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Germany  is scheduled to sell 2 billion euros ($2.6
billion) of 30-year bunds today, while Italy auctions inflation-
linked and zero-coupon debt.  German 10-year bunds yielded 1.27 percent as of 7:13 a.m.
London time. The rate slid to 1.19 percent yesterday, the lowest
since July 24. The price of the 1.5 percent securities due in
February 2023 was at 102.11. The yield on the 30-year bund was
at 2.19 percent.  Germany  last sold  the 2.5 percent securities due in July
2044 on Jan. 30 at an average yield of 2.45 percent. That
compares with a record-low rate of 2.17 percent at an auction on
July 25.  German bonds returned 0.7 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
debt gained 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
