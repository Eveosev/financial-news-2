Aeropostale Inc. (ARO) ’s former top
merchandise executive struck a secret business deal with one of
the retailer’s largest vendors and should be convicted of fraud,
a federal prosecutor told a jury.  Closing arguments began today in the two-week trial in
Brooklyn, New York, over Christopher Finazzo’s business
arrangement with Douglas Dey, a friend and controlling owner of
South Bay Apparel Inc.  Assistant U.S. Attorney John Nowak argued that Finazzo, 57,
cheated his company by directing about $350 million worth of
orders to Dey, with whom he split profits. The partnership
netted Finazzo about $25 million in extra cash over a decade,
the government alleged.  “He wanted to cover up the kickback scheme,” Nowak said
before U.S. District Judge Roslynn R. Mauskopf. “Those lies are
evidence of his guilt.”  Prosecutors brought 16 charges against Finazzo, including
conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud. The former executive
faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted of a
fraud count.  The case is U.S. v. Finazzo, 10-cr-00457, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York ( Brooklyn ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
