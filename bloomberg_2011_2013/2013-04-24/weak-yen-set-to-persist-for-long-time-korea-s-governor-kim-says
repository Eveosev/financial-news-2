Weakness in the yen has only just
begun and will continue for a “long time,” hitting South
Korean electronics, automobile and steel makers, Bank of Korea
Governor Kim Choong Soo said.  “ South Korea  will seek how to counter the weak yen,
including financial support for the most vulnerable exporters,”
Kim said in a lecture in Chuncheon, northeast of Seoul, today.
“The weak yen will continue for a long time, so we’re
cautiously and closely looking at the change.”  The slide in Japan’s currency is adding to friction between
the two nations, at odds over issues including Japanese
politicians visiting a shrine seen in  Asia  as a symbol of
wartime aggression. South Korea this month unveiled an extra
budget to stimulate growth as the nation wrestles with elevated
 household debt  and weakness in export demand.  “The phenomenon of a weak yen has only started now, even
though many people say the weak yen is already affecting the
South Korean economy,” Kim said.  While a growth revival in  Japan  could lead to a stronger
currency, so far that nation is “just printing money,” Kim
said. The nation needs structural and fiscal changes for
economic success, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
