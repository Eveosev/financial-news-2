Bank of England  Governor-designate
and  Bank of Canada  Governor  Mark Carney  praised U.K. policy
makers for giving a “tremendous amount of thought” to the Bank
of England’s new policy framework.  Carney told members of the Senate Banking  Committee  in
yesterday that authorities have taken care to create a system to
ensure policy coordination at the Bank of England.  Carney leaves the Canadian central bank June 1 to take over
the Bank of England a month later, as it takes on new powers to
promote financial stability. The U.K. central bank also has
bank-regulatory powers the Canadian central bank lacks.  Speaking in Ottawa, Carney told members of the Senate
Banking Committee that the core lesson he’s taken from his time
in Canada is “the importance of having clearly articulated
policy frameworks.”  Carney also reiterated his view that the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s
plans to fight deflation will be positive for both the global
and Canadian economies.  Asked whether the Bank of Canada has all the policy tools
it needs to promote growth, Carney said the central bank would
only resort to stimulating the economy through purchases of
securities, so-called quantitative easing, in extreme
circumstances.  Carney opened the testimony by repeating that the Bank of
Canada will probably need to raise  interest rates  in the future,
and that its current policy setting “will likely remain
appropriate for a period of time,” messages he had delivered at
the bank’s interest rate announcement last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
