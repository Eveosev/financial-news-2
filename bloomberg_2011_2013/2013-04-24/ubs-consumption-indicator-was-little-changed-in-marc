 A measure of Swiss consumer demand
increased “minimally” in March as demand for hotel
accommodation offset a decline in new car registrations and
 consumer confidence ,  UBS AG (UBSN)  said.  The  consumption indicator , which signals developments about
three months ahead, rose to 1.25 points from a revised 1.24
points in February, the Zurich-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. The February figure was previously reported as
1.26.  The indicator is based on new car registrations, retail
sales, the number of domestic overnight stays by Swiss
residents, consumer confidence and credit-card transactions at
UBS points of sale in Switzerland.  “Prime snow conditions made skiing vacations more
attractive,” while at the same time “new car registrations
collapsed in March,” UBS said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
