Braskem SA, Latin America’s largest
petrochemicals maker, rose to a two-year high as  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  recommended buying the stock after the
government cut taxes for the industry.  Shares gained 3.2 percent to 16.70 reais at 1:38 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the highest since
September 2011. The Ibovespa stock benchmark added 0.5 percent.  The Brazilian government temporarily reduced a tax on raw
materials used in the chemical industry to 1 percent from 5.6
percent, effective May 1. The levy will be gradually restored
through 2018, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told reporters in
Brasilia yesterday.  The change should boost Braskem’s earnings excluding
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 650 million
reais ($321 million) this year, according to Citigroup, which
raised its recommendation from sell. JPMorgan analysts Caio Carvalhal and Felipe dos Santos lifted their rating from hold,
citing a benefit from the tax stimulus that “is not fully
priced into Braskem shares, leaving room for further upside,”
according to a research note to clients.  The Sao Paulo-based company’s Ebitda fell to 3.5 billion
reais in 2012 from 3.6 billion reais in 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The shares have gained 30 percent this year,
while the Ibovespa declined 9.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
