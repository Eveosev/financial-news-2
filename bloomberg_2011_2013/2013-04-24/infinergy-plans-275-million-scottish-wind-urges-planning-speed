Infinergy Ltd., the U.K. wind farm
developer, plans to build three new projects representing about
180 million pounds ($275 million) of investment in  Scotland  as
it seeks to boost operations.  The Dorset-based developer is planning the Shepherds’ Rig
site with as many as 45 turbines and the Stroanshalloch and
Marnhoul parks each with a potential 16 turbines, according to
an e-mailed statement today.  The sites in Dumfries and Galloway add as much as 128
megawatts and with Infinergy’s existing projects represent about
650 million pounds of Scottish investment, Infinergy said.  While Scotland’s renewable energy targets, including a goal
to get all its power from renewables by the end of the decade
helped Infinergy’s long-term investment plans, the planning
system and process of gaining grid connection pose obstacles,
the company said in the statement.  “This causes delays in delivering on our commitments not
only to contribute to government targets but to deliver benefits
to local people as well,” Esbjorn Wilmar, chief executive
officer, said. The company, a unit of Netherlands-based KDE
Energy BV, expects to hear the outcome of the appeal of its Tom
nan Clach wind farm proposal “very soon” and is in discussions
about grid connection for a consented site at Dorenell,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
