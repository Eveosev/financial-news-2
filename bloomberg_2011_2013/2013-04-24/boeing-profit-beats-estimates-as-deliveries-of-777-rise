Boeing Co. (BA) ’s first-quarter profit
beat analysts’ estimates as increased deliveries for 777- and
737-model jets made up for the halt in buyers picking up
Dreamliners while that plane was grounded.  The stock reached the highest since 2007 after Boeing said
today that profit excluding some pension expenses climbed 5.3
percent to $1.87 billion, or $1.73 a share, from $1.77 billion,
or $1.40, a year earlier. Analysts  projected  $1.49 a share on
that basis, the average of 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The world’s largest planemaker delivered four more 777s and
three more 737s in the quarter than a year earlier amid the
pause in handing over 787 Dreamliners, which are less profitable
in part because the program is new. The 777 is Chicago-based
Boeing’s biggest and highest-priced twin-engine model.  “Fewer 787 deliveries paired with strong 737 and 777
deliveries resulted in higher profits,” Christian Mayes, an
Edward Jones analyst in  Des Peres ,  Missouri , said by e-mail. He
rates Boeing as hold.  Boeing  jumped  3 percent to $90.83 in  New York , the largest
gain since Jan. 9 and the highest closing price since Dec. 10,
2007. The shares have increased 21 percent  this year , outpacing
an 11 percent advance in the  Standard & Poor’s  500 index.  Budget Cuts  Revenue fell 2.5 percent to $18.9 billion because of the
drop in 787 deliveries and the effect of U.S. budget cuts on
Boeing’s defense business. Analysts had predicted sales of $18.8
billion.  Boeing said its commercial and defense backlog rose to a
record $392 billion as it gained $20 billion of net orders
during the quarter. Commercial deliveries of 137 planes matched
the year-earlier tally.  The quarterly profit was buoyed by 19 cents a share because
of a research-and-development tax credit, Boeing said.  Since January, Boeing has used a profit measure called core
earnings per share that it said gives a clearer picture by
adjusting for market fluctuation in pension costs. Without the
adjustment,  net income  was $1.11 billion, or $1.44 a share,
compared with $923 million, or $1.22, a year earlier. Boeing
reaffirmed its 2013  forecast  of core EPS of $6.10 to $6.30.  Operating  cash flow  tumbled 37 percent to $524 million,
hurt by the inventory buildup of Dreamliners as production
continued during the worldwide grounding ordered by regulators
to fix faults in the plane’s lithium-ion batteries.  Cash Flow  “Cash flow in the quarter was weak,” Robert Stallard, an
RBC Capital Markets analyst in  London  with a neutral rating on
the stock, said in a note to clients. “This should improve as
the 787 starts to ship again.”  Boeing is becoming more efficient in building the 787,
which entered service in 2011 after more than three years of
delays. The per-plane cost has dropped 60 percent from the
eighth jet to No. 100 on the assembly line, Chief Financial
Officer  Greg Smith  said on a conference call today. He declined
to give a dollar value.  Revenue at the commercial airplane unit fell 2.3 percent to
$10.7 billion while earnings from operations rose 13 percent to
$1.22 billion. Defense revenue slid 1.5 percent to $8.11 billion
on lower sales of military aircraft and global services and
support. Operating earnings in that business climbed 12 percent
to $832 million.  777 Production  During the quarter, Boeing delivered its first 777 built at
a production rate of 8.3 a month, part of a five-year push to
boost jetliner output more than 60 percent through 2014.  The 777  debuted  commercially in 1995, and lists for as much
as $315 million. The earliest version of the 737 began
operations in 1968. The most-expensive  737  has a  catalog price 
of $107.3 million, though airlines usually buy at a discount.  Boeing’s board may approve a new 777 design this year,
featuring upgraded engines and composite-plastic wings, Chief
Executive Officer Jim McNerney said on the call. Work on a
stretched version of the Dreamliner, or 787-10, may also get
under way in 2013, he said.  Boeing delivered only one Dreamliner in this year’s first
three months, down from 23 in the previous quarter, after the
 Federal Aviation Administration  grounded the plane on Jan. 16.  The FAA approved Boeing’s changes to the battery system on
April 19, and McNerney said on the call that deliveries should
resume in early May. Boeing reiterated a goal of handing over
more than 60 Dreamliners this year.  Fleet Retrofit  Installation of the new battery system has begun on 10
fleet aircraft and nine production jets, and Boeing expects to
complete “the bulk” of fleet retrofits by the middle of next
month, McNerney said.  Costs associated with investigating the battery faults,
designing the fix and installing the new units will be
“minor,” said CFO Smith, who didn’t give a figure.  The total bill, including compensation to airlines for the
787’s down time, may never be known, said Ken Herbert, a San
Francisco-based analyst with Imperial Capital LLC who rates the
stock as in-line, or the equivalent of hold. Boeing usually
repays carriers with discounts instead of cash, Herbert said in
a telephone interview before today’s release.  “You’ll never know for sure what they negotiate,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
