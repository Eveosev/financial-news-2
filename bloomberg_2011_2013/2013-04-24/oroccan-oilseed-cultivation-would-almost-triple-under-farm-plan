Morocco  aims to almost triple the
area seeded with oilseed crops in the country by 2020 to reduce
its dependence on vegetable-oil imports.  Oilseeds would be sown on 127,000 hectares (313,871 acres)
under an accord signed by the agriculture ministry and Folea,
Moroccoâ€™s oilseed-industry federation, according to a statement
dated yesterday. That compares with 44,000 hectares now, it
showed.  Farmers would plant sunflowers on 85,000 hectares by 2020
under the plan and rapeseed on 42,000 hectares, according to the
statement. Local production of cooking oil would rise to 93,000
metric tons a year, meeting 19 percent of national needs, from
respective equivalents of 8,000 tons and 2 percent now, it
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
