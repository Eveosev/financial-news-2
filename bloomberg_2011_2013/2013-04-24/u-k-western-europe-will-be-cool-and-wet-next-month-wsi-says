The U.K. and most of mainland
 Europe  will be cooler than normal in May while the Nordic region
will be warmer than usual, according to forecaster  WSI Corp. .  “As we head into May, we expect a pattern of cool and wet
conditions to become established across much of western Europe,
while eastern Europe and western  Russia  warms up and dries
out,”  Todd Crawford , chief meteorologist at Andover,
Massachusetts-based WSI, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Temperatures in most of southern Europe and the Nordic
region will be above average in June with the rest of the
continent cooler than usual, WSI said. All of Europe except the
U.K. and western parts of the mainland will be warmer than
normal in July, according to WSI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
