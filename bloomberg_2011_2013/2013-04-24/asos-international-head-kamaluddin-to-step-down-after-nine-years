Asos Plc, (ASC)  the U.K.â€™s largest
online-only clothing retailer, said Jon Kamaluddin will step
down after pioneering a strategy of international expansion that
has seen it enter markets from the U.S. to Australia.  Kamaluddin, who became international director in 2009 after
about five years as finance director, will depart the board in
October and leave the company by December, London-based Asos
said today. A process to appoint his successor is under way.  The proportion of sales from international markets has
risen from about a fifth to two-thirds since Kamaluddin took
over the running of the division in 2009. International revenue
rose 64 percent to about 333 million pounds ($509 million) in
the financial year ended Aug. 31. In addition to the U.S. and
Australia, Kamaluddin has led an expansion that has seen Asos
enter Russia, Singapore, China, France, Germany and  Italy .  Asos fell as much as 2.2 percent in London trading and was
down 1.4 percent at 3,087 pence as of 10:54 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
