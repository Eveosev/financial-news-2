Former President George W. Bush
urged his brother, ex-Florida Governor Jeb Bush, to run for
president in 2016, saying a match-up against former Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton would make a great race.  “He’d be a marvelous candidate if he chooses to do so,”
Bush, 66, said in an interview with ABC News broadcast last
night. “He doesn’t need my counsel because he knows what it is,
which is ‘run.’”  Jeb Bush, 60, has said he’s still undecided about whether
to seek the Republican nomination for president in 2016. Al
Cardenas, one of his longtime political associates, said last
month that the younger Bush is “open” to a campaign.  The former president, who will be dedicating his
presidential library today in  Dallas , told ABC that a race
between his brother and Clinton would be a “fantastic photo
here.” George and Jeb Bush’s father, former President George H.W. Bush, lost his bid for re-election in 1992 to Clinton’s
husband, Bill Clinton.  “I’m interested in politics,” Bush said. “I’m fascinated
by all the gossip and stuff that goes on. But the field won’t be
become clear until after the midterms,” referring to the 2014
congressional elections.  The elder Bush, Bill Clinton and former President Jimmy Carter are scheduled to attend the library dedication at
Southern Methodist University. President  Barack Obama  also is
planning to be there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
