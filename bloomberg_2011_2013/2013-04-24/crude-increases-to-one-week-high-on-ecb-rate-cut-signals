West  Texas  Intermediate crude
jumped the most this year as a government report showed that
U.S. gasoline stockpiles tumbled while oil inventories rose less
than analysts estimated.  Futures advanced 2.5 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said  gasoline  supplies fell 3.93 million barrels
last week to 217.8 million in the biggest drop in a year. Demand
gained and refineries cut operating rates. Crude in storage
climbed 947,000 barrels to 388.6 million, below the 2 million-
barrel projection in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Brent oil’s
premium to WTI in New York narrowed to the smallest level since
January 2012.  “The gasoline number was profoundly bullish,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in  St. Louis , which oversees $1.4 billion. “The
crude build was smaller than expected and once refineries are
back up and running, we might start to see some supply draws.”  WTI crude for June delivery rose $2.25 to $91.43 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since April 11. It was the biggest gain since Dec. 26. The
volume of all futures traded was 7.7 percent below the 100-day
average at 3:14 p.m.  Brent oil for June settlement advanced $1.42, or 1.4
percent, to end the session at $101.73 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The volume of all futures
traded was 5.5 percent below the 100-day average.  WTI-Brent Spread  The European benchmark grade traded at a premium of $10.30
to WTI, down from $11.13 yesterday and the narrowest level since
Jan. 18, 2012. The spread slipped after Genscape Inc. said  BP
Plc (BP/)  increased flows on the BP1 pipeline that links Cushing,
Oklahoma, to its Whiting, Indiana, refinery to 172,000 barrels a
day from about 86,000.  The 1.8 percent decline in gasoline stockpiles was the
biggest since the week ended April 6, 2012, according to the
EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical unit. Supplies of the
fuel were projected to fall 600,000 barrels, according to the
median of 11 analyst responses in the Bloomberg survey.  “The gasoline inventory number is very bullish,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York. “The gasoline number had the largest variance from the
expectations.”  Gasoline for May delivery rose 2.84 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.7474 a gallon on the Nymex.  Demand for  gasoline  increased 4.4 percent to 8.75 million
barrels a day last week, the highest level since November, the
EIA report showed.  Driving Season  Refineries operated  at 83.5 percent of capacity last week,
down 2.8 percentage points from the seven days ended April 12.
Units are often reopened in the spring after being idled for
maintenance in late winter as attention moves away from heating
oil and before the peak season for gasoline consumption, which
runs from late May until early September.  “It’s late April and attention is starting to shift to
gasoline because driving season begins in about a month,” said
 Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,
 Pennsylvania .  Motiva Enterprises LLC closed the 600,000-barrel-a-day  Port
Arthur , Texas, refinery, the largest in the U.S., after an April
14  power failure , a person familiar with the operations said.
 Total Petrochemicals U.S. Inc. (FP)  reported a fire on April 14 in
addition to the power failure that caused “operational upsets”
at the company’s 174,000-barrel-a-day plant in Port Arthur.  “The  power outage  in Port Arthur played a big part in the
fall in refinery utilization,” Evans said.  Surging Output  Crude  production  rose 118,000 barrels a day to 7.33
million, the most since April 1992, EIA data show. Output has
surged as the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale
formations in the central U.S. Inventories reached a 22-year
high of 388.9 million on April 5.  Stockpiles at Cushing, the delivery point for futures
traded in New York, increased 35,000 barrels to 51.2 million,
the EIA reported.  Oil also climbed on speculation that European Central Bank
policy makers will cut the ECB’s key interest rate to a record
low at their May 2 meeting. Banks including UBS AG and  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  forecast that the ECB will reduce
borrowing costs to 0.5 percent.  “We’re looking to Europe for guidance today,” said
 Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “The prospect of an ECB rate cut
is trumping the supply picture. Crude supplies in the U.S. are
ample and production is surging.”  $100 Floor  Venezuelan Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said April 18 that
$100 should be the crude price floor and he would inquire about
an extraordinary OPEC meeting. The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries’ next scheduled meeting is on May 31.  “The $100 level is important psychologically, because
that’s what OPEC is prepared to defend,” said  Sarah Emerson ,
managing director of Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
Massachusetts. “You have to be very bold to buy Brent at $100
because OPEC might take action at any moment.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 21.2 percent, down from 23.1 percent yesterday.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 435,436
contracts as of 3:14 p.m. It totaled 622,229 contracts
yesterday, 5.9 percent higher than the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.72 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
