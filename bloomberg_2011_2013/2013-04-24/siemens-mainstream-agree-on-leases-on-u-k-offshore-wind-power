Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd. and
a unit of  Siemens AG (SIE)  signed lease agreements to use sites off
U.K. shores for as much as 1.8 gigawatts of wind power.  Smart Wind Ltd., a venture between Siemens Financial
Services GmbH and Dublin-based Mainstream, signed leases with
the  Crown Estate , manager of the U.K. seabed, for the Optimus
and Breesea parks, the companies said today in a statement.  The projects are part of the 4-gigawatt Hornsea Zone off
the city of Hull in northeastern England that was awarded to
Smart Wind in 2010 under a program to boost clean generation.
Hornsea will provide enough power to meet 4 percent of U.K.
demand, or about 3 million homes, according to the statement.  Smart Wind is developing Hornsea in phases, with  Optimus (MLOPT) 
and Breesea the second stage. It will apply for the planning
approval for the Heron Wind and Njord first phase in the summer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
