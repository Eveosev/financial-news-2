The euro declined against the
dollar and the yen after a report showed that German business
confidence declined more than economists predicted in April.  Europe â€™s common currency fell 0.2 percent to $1.2966 as of
9:04 a.m. London time. It was 0.2 percent lower at 128.99 yen.  The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, dropped to 104.4
from 106.7 March. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast
a decline to 106.2, according to the median of 44 estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
