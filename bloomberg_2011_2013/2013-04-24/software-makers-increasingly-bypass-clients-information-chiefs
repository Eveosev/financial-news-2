Technology sellers are increasingly
sidestepping their customers’ chief information officers and
marketing their wares directly to individual departments, said
Peter Levine, a partner at venture firm Andreessen Horowitz.  Makers of software and online services are having more
success pitching their products to a client’s sales operations
or its engineering department, he said today at the  Bloomberg
Enterprise Technology Summit  in  New York . That’s a break from
the past, when the CIO acted as a gatekeeper for  information
technology  and had more sway over approving purchases.  “We’re seeing the departmentalization of IT,” Levine said
during a panel discussion. “The companies that don’t make that
shift, the broad-based changes, are going to be left behind.”  The trend has picked up steam because customers are buying
software as a service, rather than signing up for multiyear
contract -- deals that may have required more extensive vetting
from a centralized executive.  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , for instance,
sells directly to clients’ sales managers, Levine said.  GitHub
Inc. , meanwhile, is going straight to the engineering side with
its collaboration tool for developers, he said.  Levine  joined  Andreessen Horowitz in 2011 after serving as
chief executive officer of XenSource Inc., which was acquired by
Citrix Systems Inc. in 2007. Bloomberg LP, the parent of
 Bloomberg News , is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
