Iceland’s central bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson lost a lawsuit he filed against the bank for
lowering his salary, the  Supreme Court   ruled .  Gudmundsson was appointed governor of Sedlabanki in August
2009 on a 1.6 million kronur ($13,630) monthly salary. An
independent wage commission that determines the pay of
government executives reduced his salary to a total of 1.3
million kronur in March 2010, prompting Gudmundsson to sue the
bank demanding that the commission’s decision be invalidated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
