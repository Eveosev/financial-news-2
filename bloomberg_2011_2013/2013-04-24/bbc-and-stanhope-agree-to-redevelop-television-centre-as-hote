British Broadcasting Corp., the
world’s largest public broadcaster, and U.K. developer Stanhope
Plc said they plan to turn  London ’s landmark Television Centre
complex into apartments and a hotel.  The interconnected buildings, where television shows such
as “Fawlty Towers” and “ Monty Python’s Flying Circus ” were
filmed, will have its circular inner ring refurbished as a
boutique hotel and apartments, Stanhope and the BBC said in a
statement today. Neighboring sites will be refurbished as
offices for companies in the creative industries, according to
the statement.  The BBC moved the production of some radio and TV shows to
Manchester,  England , from London to save money after its funding
was frozen by the U.K. government. The broadcaster agreed to
sell the 14-acre (5.7 hectare) site in London’s White City
district to Stanhope for about 200 million pounds ($305 million)
last July.  “This development will not only deliver a legacy befitting
a site of such historical significance, but also is part of a
 BBC  property strategy which is maximizing value for money for
the licence-fee payer and releasing fresh funding for
programming,” BBC Director of Operations Dominic Coles said in
the statement.  Planning applications for the redevelopment of the
buildings, which are listed as historically significant, are
being prepared, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
