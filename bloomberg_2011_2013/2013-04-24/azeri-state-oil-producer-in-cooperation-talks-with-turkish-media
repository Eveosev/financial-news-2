State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan  said
it’s in talks with Turkish media operators after a local news
report that the Azeri oil producer had bought a television
channel and a stake in a newspaper in  Turkey .  “We are considering various forms of cooperation,” the
company said today on its  website . “Talks are still ongoing”.  The producer, known as Socar, bought Fettah Tamince’s stake
in the Star newspaper and Kanal 24 TV channel, Hurriyet daily
reported earlier, without saying where it got the information.  State-owned Socar has begun investing in media as the Baku-
based company seeks to promote its projects and Azeri interests
abroad. It said April 10 it had taken control of private Azeri
channel ATV International, which broadcasts news in regional
languages including Farsi, Armenian and Russian.  To contact the reporter on this story:
