International Finance Corp., the
 World Bank ’s private-sector financing arm, plans to lend as much
as $50 million to an Indian solar developer for building and
operating power projects.  Acme Solar Energy Pvt. will use the proceeds for a 25-
megawatt grid-connected photovoltaic power plant in the state of
 Madhya Pradesh , according to a  statement  on the IFC’s website.
The funding may be extended to other Acme projects in the states
of Odisha and  Andhra Pradesh , according to the statement.  India, which plans to raise solar capacity eightfold by
2017, in May may call for bids to build 750 megawatts of
capacity as the government seeks to boost renewable-energy
output to curb chronic blackouts that shave an estimated 1.2
percentage points off annual economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
