Japanese  stock   futures  rose,
signaling the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  may extend a gain from
its highest close in almost five years, as the central bank
convenes tomorrow and investors await earnings reports.  American depositary receipts of  Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-largest bank by market value, rose 0.9
percent. ADRs of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker,
slid 4.4 percent after its income forecast missed analysts
estimates on slumping demand for compact models. Those of
Shiseido Co., Japan’s biggest cosmetics maker, fell 3.6 percent
after forecasting its first full-year loss in eight years.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 13,915 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 13,830
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at  13,910 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Markets in Australia and  New
Zealand  are closed for a public holiday today.  “Expectations are mounting overseas for Japanese stocks
after the Nikkei’s rally yesterday confirmed a bullish trend,”
said Takashi Aoki, a Tokyo-based  fund manager  at Mizuho Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of about 3.4
trillion yen ($34 billion). “Investors are getting a sense that
the  Bank of Japan (8301)  is executing quantitative easing steadily.”  Earnings Results  Komatsu Ltd. (6301)  and  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)  are among more
than 70 companies on the Topix that report earnings today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors are weighing
how a drop in the yen will improve the earnings outlook for
exporters.  The yen has declined against all of its 16 major
counterparts since April 4, when the BOJ said it will double the
amount of money circulating in the economy by the end of 2014 by
buying  government bonds , its boldest round of quantitative
easing.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.1 percent
today. The index was little changed yesterday in  New York , as
investors weighed quarterly earnings at companies from Boeing
Co. to Apple Inc.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 7.4 percent this year
through yesterday amid optimism Japan will deploy more measures
to beat deflation and that policy makers in the U.S. and China
remain on standby to support growth. The Asian benchmark trades
at 14.1 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 14.3
times for the  S&P 500  and 12.8 times for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  The Bloomberg  China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese equities in the U.S.  rose  1.3 percent to 90.93.  To contact the reporter on this story:
