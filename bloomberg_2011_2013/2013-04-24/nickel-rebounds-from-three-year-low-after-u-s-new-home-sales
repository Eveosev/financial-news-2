Nickel rebounded from the lowest
level in more than three years after U.S. new-home sales beat
estimates. Tin and lead also advanced.  Nickel for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange gained as much as 0.5 percent to $15,200 a metric ton,
before trading at $15,165 by 11 a.m. Shanghai time. It slid to
$15,075 a ton earlier, the lowest since 2009.  Sales of new U.S. homes advanced 1.5 percent in March to a
417,000 annual pace as near record-low  mortgage rates  helped the
industry complete the strongest quarter since 2008. The median
estimate of 76 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for March
sales to rise to 416,000.  “Metals seem to be due for a rebound after the steep
losses recently,” said Wang Jun, an analyst at Beijing Cifco
Futures Co. “Any upside may be limited if data from  China  and
the U.S. at the beginning of May fail to show improvement.”  On the LME, copper, zinc and aluminum were little changed.  Copper for August delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
climbed 0.8 percent to 49,460  yuan  ($8,005) a ton. The metal for
delivery in July on the Comex gained 0.4 percent to $3.1175 per
pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
