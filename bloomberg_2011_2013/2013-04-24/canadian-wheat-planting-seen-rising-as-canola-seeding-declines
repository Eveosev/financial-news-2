Canadian wheat growers may boost
seeding by 12.3 percent this year as they decrease the amount of
canola they plant, according to a  Statistics Canada  survey.  Canada , the world’s second-biggest  wheat exporter  behind
the U.S., will plant 26.6 million acres of the grain this year,
up from 23.7 million in 2012, the Ottawa-based agency said
today. Spring-wheat acreage may rise 14.4 percent to 19.4
million acres, while durum planting could increase 9.1 percent
to 5.11 million. Canola seeding will fall 11.1 percent to 19.1
million acres, according to the Statistics Canada survey.  “The biggest reason we’re looking at more wheat is because
canola is so stressed that we need crop rotations to come in,”
said Brian Voth, an analyst at Agri-Trend Marketing Inc. in
Winnipeg, Manitoba. “We need to go back to more of a typical
oilseed-cereal rotation, and that’s been lacking.”  Wheat futures on the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  have fallen
about 7 percent this year, partly on speculation that global
production will increase.  Canola prices have climbed about 5 percent since the start
of this year on the ICE Futures Canada exchange in Winnipeg.
Barley planting will probably fall 2.2 percent to 7.24 million
acres, according to the report.  Statistics Canada said it surveyed 13,805 farmers about
their intended plantings between March 25 and April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
