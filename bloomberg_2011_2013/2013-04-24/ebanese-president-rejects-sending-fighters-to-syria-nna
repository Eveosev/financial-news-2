Lebanon’s President Michel Suleiman
rejected calls to send fighters and weapons to  Syria , the
official National News Agency said, maintaining the country’s
attempts to distance itself from its neighbors’ civil war.  Creating training camps inside Lebanon should also be
banned, the agency cited Suleiman as saying.  Two Lebanese Sunni Muslim clerics yesterday called for a
holy war to defend co-religionists in Syria from militiamen
belonging to Lebanon’s Shiite, Iranian-backed Hezbollah accused
of intervening in that country’s civil war.  The uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has
inflamed sectarian tensions in Lebanon and sparked clashes
between supporters and opponents of the Syrian government. The
fighting in turn reflects the sectarian nature of the conflict
in Syria. Assad belongs to the Alawite sect, whose religion is
an offshoot of Shiite Islam, while Syria’s insurgents are
predominantly Sunni.  To contact the reporter on this story:
