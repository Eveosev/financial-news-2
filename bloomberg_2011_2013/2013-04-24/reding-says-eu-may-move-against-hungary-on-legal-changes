The European Union will probably
start infringement procedures against  Hungary  after signaling
“serious concerns” about the erosion of the rule of law
following a disputed amendment to the constitution.  “The commission is working on a thorough legal analysis
which will lead probably to infringement procedures and this
will happen rather quickly,” European Union Justice
Commissioner Viviane Reding told reporters in Brussels today.  The European Commission, the executive arm of the 27-nation
bloc, said on April 12 that it had “serious concerns over the
compatibility” of the country’s most recent constitutional
amendment with the EU’s laws and values.  Hungary’s Parliament passed a constitutional amendment last
month that curtails judicial authority, limits campaign ads in
private media, restricts the definition of a family to marriage
and allows the criminalization of homeless people who live on
the streets. Hungary’s commissioner for fundamental rights, Mate
Szabo, asked the Constitutional Court to review the amendment,
saying the lack of parliamentary debate about parts of it was a
“serious procedural flaw,” state news agency MTI said
yesterday.  The EU’s criticism concerning the erosion of checks and
balances in Hungary is fueled by corporate lobbying as companies
seek to protect their “luxury profit” after government-
mandated utility-price cuts, Prime Minster Viktor Orban said on
April 19.  The amendment, which reinstated regulations that the
Constitutional Court had previously vetoed, underscored concern
for the rule of law and checks and balances in Hungary, where
Orban wields a two-thirds parliamentary majority.  The government recognizes EU norms and will change laws if
they are found to violate them, Antal Rogan, parliamentary group
leader of the ruling Fidesz party, said on April 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
