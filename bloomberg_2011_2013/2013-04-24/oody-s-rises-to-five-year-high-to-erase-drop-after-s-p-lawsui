Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , the second-largest
credit rater, fell after surpassing its closing level before the
Justice Department on Feb. 4 sued its biggest competitor,
Standard & Poor’s.  Moody’s closed at $54.30 in New York, after  reaching  as
high as $55.56, surpassing its closing level on Feb. 1, the last
trading day before the lawsuit was filed, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based company has gained
25.2 percent since Feb. 8.  The Justice Department lawsuit against S&P, a unit of
 McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) , alleges the world’s largest credit rater
inflated grades on mortgage-backed securities to win business
from Wall Street banks. New York-based McGraw-Hill said in a
Feb. 5 statement that the lawsuit is without merit and asked to
have it dismissed earlier this week. The company has gained 21.4
percent to $51.81 since Feb. 8, below the $58.34 reached before
the lawsuit.  Moody’s, which hasn’t been sued for fraud, has been under
investigation by the Justice Department since at least July
2011. The firm’s grades on the collateralized debt obligations
named in the government’s case are almost “identical” to those
from S&P, according to a research report from Washington-based
equity research firm Height Analytics LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
