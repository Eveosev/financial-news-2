Margins for ethanol producers may
improve as corn prices decline this year on higher supply.  “Corn will be lower six months from today, so we think
there will be higher margins to be made from ethanol
production,” John Skrinar, director of Chemoil Energy, said in
an interview at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance Summit in  New
York . Chemoil is a unit of London-based  Glencore International
Plc (GLEN) , the world’s largest publicly-traded commodities supplier.  Corn, the largest crop in the U.S. by revenue, has fallen
14 percent from the 2013 high of $7.4125 a bushel on rising
inventory estimates. Projections indicate that farmers will
boost planting of corn this year by the most since 1936.  “There is so much incentive right now for the production
of corn,” Skrinar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
