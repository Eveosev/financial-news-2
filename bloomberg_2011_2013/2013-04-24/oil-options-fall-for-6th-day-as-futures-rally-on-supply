Crude oil options volatility slid
for a sixth day after the underlying futures rallied on a
government report that U.S. gasoline stockpiles slumped and as
 oil inventories  climbed less than analysts estimated.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 21.05 percent at 4:10 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 23.01 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery advanced
$2.25 to $91.43 a barrel on the Nymex, the highest settlement
since April 11 and biggest gain since Dec. 26.  The futures rose after the Energy Information
Administration said  gasoline supplies  dropped 3.93 million
barrels to 217.8 million in the week ended April 19, the biggest
drop since April 6, 2012. Crude inventories increased 947,000
barrels to 388.6 million, below the 2 million barrels estimated
by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $80 puts. They slid 14 cents to 9 cents a barrel on volume
of 5,221 contracts at 4:13 p.m. June $75 puts, which fell 4
cents to 3 cents a barrel, were the second-most active on volume
of 2,765 lots.  Puts, or bets that crude futures will fall, accounted for
58 percent of electronic trading volume. Bearish bets made up 52
percent of trades on volume of 103,067 yesterday.  June $85 puts were the most-active options traded in the
previous session, with 6,121 contracts changing hands. They
slipped 12 cents to 76 cents a barrel. June $75 puts were
unchanged at 7 cents a barrel on volume of 5,514 lots.  Open interest was highest for June $80 puts with 40,562
contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 35,504 lots and
December $110 calls with 34,453.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
