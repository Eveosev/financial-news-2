Russia  plans to ship 17 cargoes of
East Siberia-Pacific Ocean, or ESPO, crude from the Pacific port
of Kozmino in June, according to a preliminary loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Kozmino will load 1.7 million tons, or about 415,000
barrels a day, of the blend. That is two fewer cargoes than
planned for May. Two of the shipments, which are in lots of
100,000 tons, will be transported to the terminal by rail and
the rest through the ESPO pipeline.  The pipeline, Russiaâ€™s most expensive infrastructure
project, starts at fields in east Siberia. A second phase of the
link was completed in December that expanded its capacity and
also extended it to the Pacific coast, at Kozmino, lessening the
need for rail shipments.  The program also includes a 100,000 ton rail cargo that
will load from June 29 to July 2 and a partial cargo of 32,000
tons that will be topped up at Kozmino in July.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
