Apple Inc. (AAPL)  Chief Executive Officer
 Tim Cook , taking a page from billionaire Warren Buffett, is
auctioning off a meeting over coffee to raise money for charity.  Cook is using the online fundraising website
 CharityBuzz.com  to support the Robert F. Kennedy Center for
Justice and Human Rights. After 38 bids, the highest was at
$105,000 as of 7:13 p.m. in New York, with 20 days remaining.
The website had placed an estimated value on the meeting at
Apple’s Cupertino, California, headquarters at $50,000.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  CEO Buffett raises money for the
Glide Foundation by auctioning an annual lunch meeting, using
EBay Inc. Last year’s affair raised a record $3.46 million.  The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights
was founded in 1968 with the aim of helping realize the
senator’s vision for “a more just and peaceful world,”
according to its  website .  The winning bidder for coffee with Cook will be subject to
a security screening, according to CharityBuzz.com.  “Polite manners and respect for the generous donor,” the
website says, “are a must.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
