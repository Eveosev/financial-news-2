Oil from the Bakken shale formation
sold at Clearbrook,  Minnesota , traded at the lowest level in
more than three months as domestic crudes lost ground against
the benchmark West Texas Intermediate.  Bakken weakened by 25 cents a barrel to a discount of $3.75
against WTI at 1:46 p.m. in New York, the widest discount since
Jan. 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Calumet Specialty Products Partners LP (CLMT) ’s Superior,
 Wisconsin , refinery is performing plantwide maintenance planned
to last three weeks. The 45,000-barrel-a-day refinery processes
light and heavy crude from the Bakken formation in North Dakota
and from western  Canada , according to a company filing.  Oils produced in the U.S. Gulf Coast weakened against WTI
as it trimmed its discount to Brent by 67 cents a barrel to
$10.46 at 2:02 p.m. New York time.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet weakened 55 cents to $10.60 over WTI.
Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium sank 55 cents to $11.60.  Poseidon’s premium weakened 30 cents to $5.90. Southern
Green Canyon lost 20 cents to a $4.90 premium. Mars Blend
weakened by 60 cents to $6 over the benchmark.  The premium for Thunder Horse, which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, was
unchanged at $8.90 a barrel.  Premiums for Eugene Island crude and Bonito Sour gained 10
cents a barrel to $8.85 over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
