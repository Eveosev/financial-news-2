Violence yesterday in China’s
western Xinjiang region killed 21 people, including 15
neighborhood officials and police and six attackers, the local
government  reported  on its website.  Three officials visiting a home discovered suspicious
people and banned knives and alerted their superiors by phone,
according to a report by Tianshan Net, a news website controlled
by the local government. Those workers were then held by the
suspects and when the police arrived, violence ensued and the
house was set on fire, according to the report, posted to the
Xinjiang government’s website today.  Among the 15 police and neighborhood officials killed, 10
were of the ethnic Uighur minority group, three were of the
majority Han Chinese ethnic group, and two were ethnic
Mongolian, the report said. Another two ethnic Uighurs were
injured and eight suspects were taken into custody, according to
the report.  The incident took place in the western part of Xinjiang
near the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar. The central
government in Beijing faces occasional challenges to its power
from Uighurs, who make up less than half of Xinjiang’s
population of about 22 million. Unrest in the city of Urumqi in
2009 killed almost 200 people.  Years of central government policies encouraging migration
of majority Han Chinese to areas such as Tibet and Xinjiang have
stoked ethnic tensions.  China  views groups pushing for greater
independence as seditious.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
