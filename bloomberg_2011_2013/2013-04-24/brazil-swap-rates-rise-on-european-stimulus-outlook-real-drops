Brazil’s swap rates climbed from a
two-month low as the prospect of European monetary stimulus
fueled speculation that the South American country’s central
bank will raise borrowing costs to contain inflation.  Swap rates due in January 2015 rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 8.28 percent at 11:45 a.m. in Sao
Paulo. They closed yesterday at 8.25 percent, the lowest level
since Feb. 14. The real slid 0.1 percent to 2.0245 per dollar.  “The markets are preferring to ignore bad indicators and
are expecting stimulus measures, mainly in the euro region,”
Daniel Cunha, an economist at XP Investimentos, said in a
telephone interview from  Rio de Janeiro .  Brazil’s swap rates tumbled on April 18, the day after the
central bank raised borrowing costs less than some analysts had
forecast. Board members voted 6 to 2 to increase the target
lending  rate  by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent from a record
low 7.25 percent. A survey by Bloomberg showed that 18 of 58
analysts had forecast an increase of 50 basis points.  Policy makers said in their statement that “the high level
of inflation” and “resilience of inflation” required a
response tempered by the central bank’s recognition that
“external uncertainties” also required “that monetary policy
be managed with caution.”  Minutes of the April 16-17 meeting are due tomorrow.  Brazil ’s  consumer prices  rose at an annual rate of 6.59
percent in March, exceeding the upper limit of the central
bank’s preferred range for the first time since November 2011.
The target is 4.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points
 Latin America ’s largest economy grew 0.9 percent in 2012,
compared with 2.7 percent in 2011 and 7.5 percent in 2010.  The  European Central Bank  will cut its target lending rate
to a record low next week to boost a slumping euro-region
economy, according to Nomura Holdings Inc., UBS AG and  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc. (RBS)   To contact the reporters on this story:
