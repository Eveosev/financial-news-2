Mexico ’s peso weakened after orders
for U.S. durable goods fell in March by the most in seven
months, rekindling concern that the recovery in the Latin
American country’s biggest trading partner is faltering.  The currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 12.2790 per dollar
at 9:12 a.m. in Mexico City. The currency is still up 4.7
percent in 2013, the biggest rally among the greenback’s 16
major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  The peso slipped today after a U.S. Commerce Department
report showed bookings for goods meant to last at least three
years decreased 5.7 percent, more than forecast by analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, after a revised 4.3 percent gain the
prior month that was smaller than previously estimated. Mexico
sends about 80 percent of its exports to its northern neighbor.  “The headline number was very bad,”  Ramon Cordova , a
currency trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza Garcia,
Mexico, said in a telephone interview.  Mexico’s inflation-linked bond yields rose after a report
today from the national statistics agency showed consumer prices
fell 0.09 percent in the first two weeks of April from the end
of March.  Yields on inflation-linked debt maturing in December
increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.70
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on
fixed-rate peso bonds due in 2024 rose two basis points to 4.64
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
