Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards rose,
snapping a two-day decline, as inflows into the nation’s assets
continued after  Japan ’s monetary stimulus earlier this month.  Overseas investors have pumped 8.72 trillion rupiah ($897
million) into the country’s local-currency notes since April 3,
the day before Japan’s central bank said it would buy 7.5
trillion yen ($75 billion) of debt per month, helping to push
the yen to a four-year low. Global funds bought $74 million more
Indonesian stocks than they sold yesterday, the most since March
1, exchange data show.  The currency’s twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose
0.2 percent to 10,185 per dollar in Jakarta, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  “There is some money coming in, and also anticipation that
the weaker yen will pump some inflows into Indonesia from
Japan,” said Irene Cheung, a currency strategist at  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in  Singapore . “Still, we are
cautious on the rupiah as the government needs to do something
to tackle the current-account deficit.”  Indonesia posted a shortfall in the broadest measure of
trade of $24.2 billion in 2012, the biggest annual deficit since
Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1989.  The rupiah was little changed at 9,723 per dollar,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. One-
month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings
used to price options, dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 5.75 percent.  The yield on the government’s 5.25 percent bonds due May
2018 fell one basis point to 4.95 percent, according to prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association. The yield has declined
21 basis points in five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
