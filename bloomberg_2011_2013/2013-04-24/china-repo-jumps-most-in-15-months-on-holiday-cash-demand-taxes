China ’s benchmark money-market rate
rose the most in 15 months as demand for cash increased ahead of
a public holiday next week and as corporate taxes come due.  Companies need to pay about 400 billion yuan ($64.7
billion) to 500 billion yuan in total annual taxes before the
end of this month, Chen Qi, a strategist with UBS Securities Co.
in Shanghai, said this week. Domestic financial markets are
closed for three days from April 29.  “Onshore liquidity is getting tighter this week because we
are close to the month-end, and the holiday adds more pressure
on liquidity,” said Ethan Mou, a strategist at Bank of America
Corp. in Hong Kong.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed 109 basis points, or 1.09
percentage point, to 4.74 percent as of 3:37 p.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. That’s the biggest increase since Jan.
16, 2012. It reached 5.5 percent yesterday, the highest level
since Feb. 23 last year.  China’s central bank asked participants in the nation’s
interbank bond market to examine trading histories, said two
people with knowledge of the matter amid reports of a probe into
illegal transactions.  Bond Probe  The People’s Bank of China held a meeting last week with
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System, the National
Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors and
other market participants to discuss possible measures for
boosting control over trading, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly
about the matter. The central bank said revelations of illegal
trading had recently surfaced, according to the people.  The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for 28-day
repurchase contracts and 14-day reverse-repo agreements this
morning, according to a trader required to bid at the sales.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose one basis
point to 3.29 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The government sold 30 billion  yuan  of 10-year bonds at a
yield of 3.4207 percent, according to the finance ministry’s
website. The highest winning bid yield was 3.4497 percent, the
trader said.  The yield on 3.15 percent government bonds due January,
2018 was little changed at 3.18 percent today, according to the
National Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
