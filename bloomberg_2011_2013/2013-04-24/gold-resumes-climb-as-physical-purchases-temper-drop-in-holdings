Gold futures rose for the fourth
time in five sessions as investor demand for coins surged amid a
slump in exchange-traded products backed by the metal.  Britain’s Royal Mint sold more than three times the amount
of coins this month than a year earlier after prices dropped the
most in three decades, while the  U.S. Mint  ran out of its
smallest American Eagle coin. Last week, futures plunged 7
percent, the most since September 2011, and ETP holdings headed
for a record monthly plunge.  “Support for  gold prices  is coming from the cash market,”
Jeffrey Friedman, a senior commodity broker at RJO Futures in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “There’s still a
bearish tone to things, but a lot of the weak longs have been
flushed out. People who take physical delivery of gold tend to
hold onto it for a while.”  Gold futures for June delivery climbed 1.1 percent to close
at $1,423.70 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Since touching a 26-month low of $1,321.50 on April 16, the
price has climbed 7.7 percent.  In 2013, futures have slumped 15 percent after 12 years of
advances. Assets held in the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest ETP,
tumbled yesterday to the lowest since October 2009. They have
dropped  10 percent this month.  UBS AG said yesterday that physical gold flows to  India ,
the world’s biggest buyer, approached the highest since 2008,
while Standard Chartered Plc said shipments last week were 20
percent above the previous record.  ‘Impressive’ Bounce  “The bounce in price-sensitive physical demand, especially
in the emerging world, is impressive and has lifted prices,”
Howard Wen, an analyst at HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., said in a
report. “ETF selling remains the main obstacle to a more
vigorous recovery.”  Silver futures for July delivery increased 0.1 percent to
settle at $22.978 an ounce on the Comex after gaining as much as
2.2 percent. Trading on the exchange doubled compared with the
100-day average. The metal has declined 24 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery rose 0.9 percent to $1,430.80 an ounce.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$667.65 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
