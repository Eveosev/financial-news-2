Domino’s Pizza Group Plc (DOM) , the U.K.
maker of the Hot Dog Stuffed Crust pizza, rose to the highest
price ever as investors warm to its rapid growth in sales via
the Internet and mobile phones, and an expansion in Germany.  The stock has risen 17 percent since Domino’s reported
accelerating first-quarter same-store revenue growth on April 4
and is the second-best performer in the  FTSE All-Share Travel &
Leisure Index (FALEIS)  in the past month.  “The company is capable of sustaining about a 20 percent
earnings growth rate from 2014,” Douglas Jack, an analyst at
Numis Securities Ltd, said on the day of the earnings report as
he upgraded to stock to  buy . “The risk to numbers is clearly on
the upside.”  Almost 62 percent of U.K.-delivered sales in the first
quarter came via the Internet, versus just less than 50 percent
a year earlier, according to the Milton Keynes, England-based
company. Sales via all online platforms rose 38 percent to 82.4
million pounds. Domino’s is also expanding its number of
locations, with plans to open 60 new stores in the U.K. this
year, and 18 in  Germany .  The  shares  rose 2.7 percent to 665.5 pence, the highest
closing price since the U.K. Domino’s became publicly traded in
1999, lifting the company’s market value to 1.09 billion pounds
($1.66 billion). Trading volume was almost 40 percent more than
the daily average over the past three months.  Jack predicts the shares will rise to 700 pence, topped
only by the 770-pence target of Benjamin Moore at Goldman Sachs
among analysts who share their reports with Bloomberg.  Beating U.S.  The U.K. based pizza deliverer has outperformed its U.S.
counterpart this year, rising 34 percent compared to a 17
percent gain, through yesterday, for Ann Arbor, Michigan-based
Domino’s Pizza Inc.  The company’s German operation is forecast to become
profitable by the end of 2015. It’s doubling the number of
stores in the country to 36 this year. Underlying earnings per
share in U.K. operations rose 22 percent last year, Jack
estimated.  Domino’s Pizza operates on a franchise basis and had 810
outlets as of March 31.  The average U.K. franchisee made a profit before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of about 109,000 pounds a
store last year, according to a company presentation. The
typical franchisee owns more than six outlets. The average
investment per outlet is about 280,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
