The  yuan  rose toward the strong end
of its permitted trading range as a pickup in U.S. home sales
boosted demand for riskier assets and on speculation China will
widen the currency’s trading band this year.  Most Asian stocks gained after data yesterday showed sales
of new homes in the world’s biggest economy climbed 1.5 percent
last month to a 417,000 annual pace, compared with a 7.6 percent
slide the previous month. China is likely to widen the yuan’s
trading band against the dollar in 2013 to tighten monetary
conditions, Commonwealth Bank of  Australia  strategists Richard Grace and Andy Ji wrote in a note yesterday. The yuan remains
undervalued and will gain another 3 percent to reach 6 per
dollar by end of this year, they forecast.  “Sentiment has improved as data suggests the U.S. economy
is stable,” said Patrick Cheng, a foreign-exchange analyst at
Haitong International Securities Co. in Hong Kong. “There’s
still speculation on band widening, which translates into bets
on a stronger yuan.”  The yuan gained 0.02 percent to close at 6.1781 per dollar
in Shanghai, according to the  China  Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The PBOC lowered the  reference rate  by 0.04 percent to
6.2384 today. The spot was at a 0.97 percent premium to the
daily fixing, near the maximum 1 percent divergence allowed by
the central bank.  Australian Investment  Australia’s central bank plans to invest about 5 percent of
its foreign currency reserves in China as it deepens ties with
the world’s second-largest economy, Deputy Governor Philip Lowe
said today in Shanghai. That implies investing A$1.8 billion to
A$2.4 billion ($1.9 billion to $2.5 billion) in yuan and onshore
Chinese government bonds, Commonwealth Bank estimated in a
research note today.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan climbed 0.12
percent to 6.1710 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 6.1705 earlier, the strongest in data
compiled by Bloomberg going back to August 2010. Twelve-month
non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.05 percent to 6.2510,
trading at a 1.2 percent discount to the spot rate in  Shanghai .  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.32 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
