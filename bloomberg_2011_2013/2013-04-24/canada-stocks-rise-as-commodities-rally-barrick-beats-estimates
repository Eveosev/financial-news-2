Canadian  stocks  rose, giving the
benchmark index its largest gain since August, as commodities
rallied and  Barrick (ABX)  Gold Corp.’s results surpassed estimates.  Barrick, the world’s largest gold producer by sales, jumped
the most since 2009 as better-than-estimated mining costs and
gold output boosted first-quarter earnings. Alacer Gold Corp.
and New Gold Inc. surged at least 9.8 percent as the price of
the metal rallied.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B)  added 4.7 percent after
copper rebounded from a bear market. Suncor Energy Inc.,
 Canada ’s largest oil producer, gained 2.6 percent as crude
increased.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 179.49
points, or 1.5 percent, to 12,270.43 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark equity gauge has increased 2.7 percent in the past
five sessions, the longest streak of gains since January.
Trading volume was in line with the 30-day average.  “It’s very heavily weighted towards the commodity space
today, they’re all bouncing back,” Michael O’Brien, a  fund
manager  with TD Asset Management, said on the phone from
Toronto. He manages about C$3 billion ($3 billion). “The entire
commodity complex has been sold down so viciously over the past
couple weeks that people had to stop and pause for breath.”  Commodity stocks  contributed  most to gains in the benchmark
index, as raw-material producers rose 5 percent for the biggest
advance since November 2011. The S&P/TSX Materials Index has
fallen 24 percent this year.  Gold advanced 1.1 percent to settle at $1,423.70 an ounce
in  New York , the fourth increase in five sessions, as signs of
more physical purchases tempered shrinking assets in exchange-
traded products. The metal has rallied 7.7 percent since
touching a low of $1,321.50 on April 16.  Alacer, Barrick  Alacer Gold jumped 17 percent to C$2.95 and New Gold soared
9.8 percent to C$7.88. The S&P/TSX Gold Index added 6.6 percent,
the most since June, as 29 of 30 members advanced.  Barrick rallied 7.6 percent to C$19.38, the biggest gain
since September 2009. The miner posted adjusted first-quarter
 earnings  of 92 cents a share, compared with the 86-cent average
of 21 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s total cash cost to produce an ounce of gold
was $561, compared with $540 a year earlier and the $654 average
of six estimates. The Toronto-based company is also considering
suspending the $8.5 billion Pascua-Lama project on the border of
Chile and  Argentina .  Jamie Sokalsky, chief executive officer, said at a
shareholder meeting in Toronto today Barrick is still looking
for more ways to cut costs and will need to manage without the
promise of higher gold prices. Barrick has plunged 44 percent
this year.  Oyu Tolgoi  Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd., which is developing the $6.6
billion Oyu Tolgoi gold project in  Mongolia  with parent Rio
Tinto Group, soared 16 percent to C$7.  Nick Cousyn, chief operating officer with BDSec, a
brokerage in Mongolia, said the Mongolian government, which has
been locked in negotiations with the company over costs and
environmental concerns, is now looking to do “everything
possible” to ensure production starts in June.  “This is a significant about-face,” Cousyn said in a note
yesterday, advising investors to “move up their time frames and
buy now.”  Teck Resources, Canada’s largest diversified miner, gained
4.7 percent to C$26.80 as copper for July delivery rose 2
percent to settle at $3.165 a pound in New York. The metal fell
into a  bear market  last week on concern slowing economies in the
U.S. and  China  would reduce demand. Copper prices have dropped
12 percent this year.  Suncor climbed 2.6 percent to C$29.60 and Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd. rallied 2.3 percent to C$29.45. Crude for June
delivery jumped the most this year, adding 2.5 percent to settle
at $91.43.  To contact the reporter on this story:
