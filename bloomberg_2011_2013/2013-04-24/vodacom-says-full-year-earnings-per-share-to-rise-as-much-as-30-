Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , South Africa’s
largest wireless carrier, rose the most in almost three years as
the company said its full-year earnings per share increased as
much as 25 percent.  The shares  advanced  5.7 percent, the most on an intraday
basis since May 2010, and were 5.2 percent higher at 110.36 rand
by 11:46 a.m. in Johannesburg. Earnings per share excluding one-
time items were up 20 percent to 25 percent in the 12 months
through March, the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today. That implies an outcome of as much as 8.86
rand, ahead of the 8.40 rand median  estimate  of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The trading statement this morning surprised the market
positively,” David Lerche, an analyst at Avior Research (Pty)
Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg today. “It shows that the
market’s concern about Vodacom was probably overdone.”  Vodacom, which is 65 percent-owned by  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,
is overhauling its stores and expanding its business after local
mobile sales fell in the three months through December. The
company is becoming increasingly important for its parent, as
Newbury, England-based Vodafone struggles to halt a slide in its
European business.  Basic earnings per share is expected to be between 25
percent and 30 percent higher, according to the statement. That
implies a final outcome of as much as 9.02 rand, compared with
analyst forecasts of 8.51 rand.  Vodacom expects to publish its full-year earnings statement
on or about May 20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
