Google Inc. (GOOG)  Chief Business Officer
 Nikesh Arora  received $46.7 million in total compensation last
year, more than double from a year earlier, becoming the
company’s highest-paid executive, a regulatory filing shows.  Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette was next highest,
receiving $38.7 million in 2012, also more than doubling from a
year earlier, according to the filing yesterday. The company
awarded  David Drummond , chief legal officer, $31.3 million
during the year, a 71 percent boost from 2011.  Google’s net income gained 10 percent to $10.7 billion as
sales increased 32 percent to $50.2 billion last year. The
compensation increase was especially high in 2012 after the
company last year started to hand out equity awards only in
even-numbered years, according to the filing.  “Granting less frequently allows us to incorporate
performance over a longer time period into our equity
decisions,” Mountain View, California-based Google said in the
filing. “We expect that future equity awards will also have
higher at-grant target values than awards made under our
pre-2012 annual granting practices.”  Chairman  Eric Schmidt  received total compensation of $7.63
million last year, down from $101 million in 2011, when his pay
was boosted by stock and options valued at $93.8 million.  Chief Executive Officer  Larry Page  and co-founder Sergey Brin each received a $1 salary last year, unchanged from 2011.
Page and Brin rank 25th and 26th, respectively, on the Bloomberg
Billionaires Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
