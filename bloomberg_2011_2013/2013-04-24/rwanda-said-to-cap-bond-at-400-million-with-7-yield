Rwanda will cap its debut dollar
bond sale at $400 million, with final yield guidance given at
6.875 percent to 7 percent, according to a person with knowledge
of the offering.  The 10-year Eurobond offering by the East African nation is
expected to price tomorrow following investor meetings in Asia,
 Europe  and the U.S. that started April 18, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
The government appointed BNP Paribas SA and Citigroup Inc. as
lead managers for the offering, it said last week. Rwanda is
rated B with a stable outlook by both Standard & Poor’s and
Fitch Ratings, five levels below investment grade.  Rwanda joins other sub-Saharan African nations including
Nigeria, Zambia,  Ghana , Gabon,  Senegal  and  Namibia  in selling
international debt. Less than 20 years after a genocide that
killed about 800,000 people, President Paul Kagame is boosting
transport links and promoting regional trade with the aim of
lifting the land-locked tea- and coffee-growing nation into a
middle-income economy by 2020.  “The price guidance is broadly in line with market
expectations and probably represents fair value given the
country’s fundamentals and the size of the issue,”  Samir Gadio ,
a London-based  emerging markets  strategist at Standard Bank
Group Ltd., said in an e-mailed reply to questions today.  Index Inclusion  The offering would need to be at least $500 million to be
eligible for inclusion in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s emerging-
markets bond index.  “A benchmark issue would have reduced the external funding
cost,” Gadio said. “But even in this case we suspect the
Rwandese bond would have still been placed at a premium to other
mainstream sub-Saharan Africa sovereign Eurobonds given the
weaker external and fiscal metrics.”  Ghana’s dollar bonds due October 2017, also rated B by S&P,
yielded 4.723 percent at 3:08 p.m. in London, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Zambia, rated one level higher at B+ by
S&P and Fitch, sold $750 million of Eurobonds in September with
a final yield of 5.625 percent.  Rwanda will use $200 million to repay loans on the Kigali
Convention Centre and a development plan for RwandAir, the
national carrier, according to a copy of the prospectus obtained
by Bloomberg News. Another $150 million will be spent completing
the center and $50 million on a hydropower plant, according to
the prospectus.  The country plans to raise about 10 billion Rwandan francs
($15.7 million) by selling stakes in 13 state-owned companies
focusing on agriculture, services, transport, banking and
insurance industries by the end of the fiscal year of 2014 to
2015, according to the prospectus.  Economic Expansion  Rwanda is seeking funds to boost an economy that doubled to
about $6.4 billion in the nine years through 2010 as it rebuilds
from the 1994 genocide.  Economic expansion may slow to 7.5 percent this year from
7.7 percent in 2012, Paulo Drummond, the International Monetary
Fund’s mission chief to the country, told reporters in the
capital Kigali on April 16. The main risks to growth include aid
cuts and project delays, he said. About 40 percent of the
country’s budget is financed by grants, making up 11 percent of
gross domestic product in 2010-2011, according to the World
Bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
