Ethanol tumbled the most in three
weeks versus gasoline as lower corn costs and improving returns
to make the fuel entice companies to resume output.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 3.82 cents to
32.72 cents a gallon at 11:40 a.m.  New York  time, the biggest
one-day widening since April 1. Poet LLC and  Abengoa SA (ABG)  said
yesterday they resumed output at distilleries that were closed
after drought in the Midwest boosted corn prices to a record and
increased manufacturing costs.  “This makes sense,” said Jim Damask, a manager at
Starfuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida . “When prices got a little
high, a lot more product became available. There was some margin
that they saw and they turned the plants back on.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery  fell 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.415 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 10 percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery advanced 2.32 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.7422 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  rose 2.5 percent to 853,000 barrels a
day in the week ended April 19, the highest since April 5, a
report from the Energy Information Administration showed today.  Stockpiles increased 0.5 percent to 17.6 million barrels,
the Energy Department’s analytical arm said. That’s down 19
percent from a year earlier.  Corn Declining  Corn has dropped 14 percent from the 2013 high of $7.4125 a
bushel on rising inventory estimates and projections that
farmers would boost planting to the most since 1936. Futures for
May delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $6.405 a bushel
today in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  The corn crush spread was 9 cents a gallon, down from 11
cents yesterday. That compares to minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 93 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, the lowest level since March 29 and
down from 94 percent the previous week, the EIA report showed
today.  The U.S. made foreign purchases of the fuel for the first
time in three weeks. Imports were 39,000 barrels a day in the
week ended April 19, up from 11,000 a year earlier.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  fetched $2.46 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
