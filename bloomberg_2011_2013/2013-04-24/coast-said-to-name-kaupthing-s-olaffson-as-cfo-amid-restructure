(Corrects spelling of Olafsson in headline.)  Coast , the U.K. seller of smart-
formal wear that’s controlled by Iceland’s failed Kaupthing Bank
Hf, appointed the bank’s Pall Olafsson as chief financial
officer after the business’s separation from its parent company,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  The executive will start in June, said one of the people,
who declined to be identified as the matter is private. Margaret McDonald, who formerly ran women’s footwear and fashion chain LK
Bennett, will remain chief executive officer, the person said,
citing a memorandum distributed to staff today.  Olafsson is already a non-executive director of Coast as
part of his role on Kaupthing Bank’s resolution committee. The
retailer announced in March it was being run as a standalone
business as part of a break-up of the Aurora fashion chain that
also includes Warehouse and Oasis fast-fashion stores, now
called Fresh Channel. The retailer plans to focus on opening
more U.K. stores, a website and overseas outlets.  Olafsson joined Kaupthing in October 2003 and has worked
for the resolution committee overseeing the bank’s investments
in fashion retail since 2009. He has also worked with management
teams at Aurora and held a number of non-executive directorships
and board observer roles, the person said.  Coast has about 40 stores and 166 concession spaces in the
U.K., as well as 109 international outlets in  Europe ,  Australia ,
the Middle East, Nordic and Far East markets, its website says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
