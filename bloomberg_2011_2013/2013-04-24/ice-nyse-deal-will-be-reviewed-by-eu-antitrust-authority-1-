The European Commission said it
will review plans by  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)  to purchase
NYSE Euronext after national regulators didn’t object to it
taking the lead.  Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Union’s
Brussels-based antitrust authority, said it now has jurisdiction
over the deal, which has yet to be formally notified by the
companies.  ICE, the energy and commodity futures bourse, said in March
that it sought an EU review of its acquisition to avoid separate
probes in the U.K., Spain and Portugal.  ICE agreed on Dec. 21 to acquire NYSE Euronext for cash and
stock totaling $8.2 billion at the time. EU regulators blocked
 Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) ’s purchase of NYSE last year, citing concern
over competition in derivatives and clearing.  Brookly McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for Atlanta-based ICE,
didn’t respond to a phone call for comment before office hours.
Caroline Tourrier, a spokeswoman for  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  in Paris,
said the company has no comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
