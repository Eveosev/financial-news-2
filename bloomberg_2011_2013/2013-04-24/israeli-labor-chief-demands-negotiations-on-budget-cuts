The head of  Israel ’s national labor
federation demanded that the government start talks immediately
on possible cuts in the 2013-2014 budget, and threatened to take
action if it fails to comply.  Proposed budget reductions “can seriously damage the
economic situation of workers and pensioners,” Ofer Eini,
Histadrut federation chairman, said in an e-mailed statement
today. “If immediate negotiations don’t take place, we will use
every means at our disposal.”  There is a 40 billion-shekel ($11 billion) budget hole and
sweeping economic steps are needed, Deputy Finance Minister
Mickey Levy said yesterday on Israel Radio. While budget
proposals for 2013-2014 were presented this week to Prime
Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , no decisions had yet been taken,
Levy said.  The Histadrut represents about 800,000 workers, including
most of Israel’s public sector employees, according to
spokeswoman Dafna Cohen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
