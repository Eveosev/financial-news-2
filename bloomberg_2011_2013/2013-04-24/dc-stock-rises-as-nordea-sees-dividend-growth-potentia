TDC A/S (TDC)  rose the most among
Copenhagen’s benchmark stocks today after  Nordea Bank AB (NDA) 
predicted Denmark’s biggest phone operator will be able to raise
dividends as taxes and borrowing costs decline.  TDC gained as much as 2.2 percent, the most since April 2
and the biggest intraday jump on the  Copenhagen 20 Index. (KFX)  The
stock was trading up 0.7 percent at 44.64 kroner at 10:25 a.m.
in the Danish capital, with trading volume at 18 percent of the
three-month daily average.  The company, which said in February that revenue and profit
will decline in 2013, will improve cash flows in coming years,
analysts at Nordea said today in a report. The bank raised its
 recommendation  on the Copenhagen-based phone company’s stock to
buy from hold and lifted its share-price estimate by 8.1 percent
to 50 kroner.  TDC’s  cash flow  “will be supported by a lower Danish
corporate-tax rate and a refinancing of debts at lower  interest
rates , which gradually will increase dividend payments,” Nordea
said.  The phone company lowered payout terms on Nov. 6, saying
that it will pay about 90 percent of equity free cash flow after
special items, compared with a previous ratio of 80 percent to
85 percent of cash before special items.  TDC has made two dividend payments each of 2.3 kroner a
share since August 2012. The next dividend payment, scheduled
for August this year, will decline to 1.85 kroner a share,
according to  dividend projections  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
