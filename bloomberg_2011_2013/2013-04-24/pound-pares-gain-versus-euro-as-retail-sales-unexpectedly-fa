The pound pared a gain versus the
euro after a report showed a gauge of U.K. retail sales
unexpectedly fell this month.   Sterling was little changed at 85.25 pence per euro as of
11:11 a.m. London time after appreciating as much as 0.4 percent
to 85.01 pence, the strongest since April 12.  The yield on 10-year gilts rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.73 percent.  Annual sales growth slipped to minus 1 from zero in March,
the London-based Confederation of British Industry business
lobby group said today. Thatâ€™s the weakest reading in eight
months. Economists had forecast an increase to 8, according to
the median of eight estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.   To contact the reporter on this story:
