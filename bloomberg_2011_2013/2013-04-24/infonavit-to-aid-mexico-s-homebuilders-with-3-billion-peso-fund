Infonavit,  Mexico ’s state-backed
mortgage lender, set up a fund to promote apartment
construction, as the country’s biggest publicly traded
homebuilders sell assets or restructure debt amid a cash
squeeze.  The 3 billion-peso ($246 million) stimulus fund will be
used to finance mortgages on so-called vertical housing projects
when construction is at least half completed, according to an e-
mailed statement from Infonavit. The program also will ease
mortgage-underwriting criteria to make more workers eligible and
allow the agency to triple its capacity to originate loans,
Infonavit said.  Securities of  Mexican homebuilders  have plunged this year
as the government shifted housing policy to promote capital-
intensive apartment construction in urban areas over single-
family homes in commuter towns. Shares of the country’s biggest
builder, Desarrolladora Homex SAB, have plunged 45 percent this
year in Mexico City trading, and its bonds due 2020 are fetching
about 68 cents on the dollar.  “It definitely will help some companies, but it’s not the
solution,” Carlos Hermosillo, an equity analyst with Grupo
Financiero Banorte SAB, said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
