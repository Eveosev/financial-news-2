California  Governor  Jerry Brown 
said he’d fight attempts by Democrats who control the
legislature to derail his proposal to overhaul how the state
doles out money for schools.  “If people are going to fight it, they’re going to get the
battle of their lives,” Brown told reporters in the statehouse
in Sacramento. “I’m not going to give up until the last hour.
I’m going to fight with everything I have.”  Brown, a 75-year-old Democrat, in January proposed a budget
that would give school districts more flexibility in how they
spend state money by in part eliminating many education spending
mandates, such as one that requires schools to reduce class
sizes. He would change formulas used to calculate how much each
school gets, so that low-income districts receive more, and to
improve the education of poor children learning English.  Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, a  Sacramento 
Democrat, said he’ll unveil an alternative to Brown’s proposal
as early as tomorrow that would delay the reforms for one year
and scrap the core feature of Brown’s plan that would shift more
money to districts where high-needs students make up a majority
of the student population.  “This is not an ordinary legislative measure,” Brown
said. “This is a cause. It’s a cause for the children of
California. I am going to do everything I can to make sure this
passes this year. I will fight any effort to dilute this bill.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
