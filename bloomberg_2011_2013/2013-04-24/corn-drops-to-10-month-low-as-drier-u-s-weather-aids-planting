Corn futures rebounded from the
lowest in almost 10 months after a government report showed
increased U.S. production of grain-based ethanol in the U.S.
Soybeans and wheat fell.  Ethanol  production  climbed 2.5 percent to 853,000 barrels a
day, pushing the three-week average to the highest since July.
Companies including  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ,  Abengoa SA (ABG)  and Poet LLC
have resumed output at plants that were idled after drought in
the Midwest cut supplies of corn. The grain has dropped 11
percent this year on speculation that U.S. and global production
will rebound.  “We have more ethanol producers resuming operations and
buying more corn,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodity
Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa, said in a telephone interview.
“The lower corn price definitely helped.”  Corn futures for delivery in July gained 0.7 percent to
close at $6.1825 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade after touching $6.10, the lowest since June 26 for a most-
active contract.  Soybean prices slid on speculation that wet, cold weather
delaying planting in the northern Midwest and Great Plains will
lead to farmers switching from corn and wheat to sow more of the
oilseed,  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in Minneapolis, said in a telephone interview.  Soybean futures for delivery in July fell 1 percent to
$13.4525 a bushel on the CBOT. Earlier, the price touched
$13.41, the lowest since June 18.  Wheat futures for July delivery declined 0.5 percent to
$6.92 a bushel in Chicago, capping the first three-session drop
since Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
