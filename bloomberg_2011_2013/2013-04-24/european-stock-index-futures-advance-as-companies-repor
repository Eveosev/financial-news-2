European stocks  rose for a fourth
day as companies from PSA Peugeot Citroen to Volkswagen AG
posted results and speculation mounted that the region’s central
bank will cut rates, offsetting worse-than-estimated German
business confidence data.  Peugeot surged 10 percent after  Europe ’s second-biggest
carmaker reported first-quarter revenue that beat estimates.
Volkswagen added 2.6 percent after retaining its 2013 earnings
target.  Rio Tinto  Group and  BHP Billiton  Ltd. advanced in line
with their European peers as metal prices rebounded in  London .  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  gained 0.7 percent to 294.63 at
the close of trading. The gauge has rallied 3.8 percent over the
past four days as companies from ARM Holdings Plc to Cie.
Financiere Richemont SA topped estimates and a contraction in
manufacturing and services output fueled speculation the
 European Central Bank  will cut interest rates next week.  “European markets are being supported by expectations of
additional ECB stimulus which has helped overcome a slump in
Germany’s Ifo confidence index,” said Ioan Smith, a strategist
at Knight Capital Europe Ltd. in London. “Earnings expectations
had come down a lot, and as ever analysts always overshoot in
both directions.”  Economists from Nomura International Plc to UBS AG and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc now expect the central bank to
cut its key  interest rate  to a record low as the euro-region
economy slumps. Twenty-one out of 36 economists surveyed expect
the ECB to cut rates to 0.5 percent, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  German Confidence  German business confidence fell for a second month in
April, a report showed today. The Ifo institute in Munich said
its  business climate index , based on a survey of 7,000
executives, dropped to 104.4 from 106.7 in March. The median
economist forecast in a Bloomberg News  survey  forecast a decline
to 106.2.  National benchmark indexes climbed in all of the 18 western
European markets except Ireland. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 increased
0.4 percent, Germany’s DAX rallied 1.3 percent and  France ’s CAC
40 added 1.6 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 12 percent greater than the 30-day average, according to
Bloomberg data.  Peugeot advanced 10 percent to 6.02 euros, its largest gain
since Feb. 22. Europe’s second-biggest carmaker reported a 6.5
percent decline in first-quarter revenue to 13 billion euros
($16.9 billion). That still beat the 12.7 billion-euro average
analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey, as delivery growth in
 China  and  Latin America  limited the decline.  Volkswagen Earnings  Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest automaker, added 2.6 percent
to 150.70 euros after reporting first-quarter profit that met
analysts’ estimates and retaining its 2013 earnings target.
Earnings before interest and taxes fell to 2.34 billion euros
from 3.17 billion euros a year earlier. Revenue declined 1.6
percent.  Storebrand ASA (STB)  rose 6.5 percent to 25.21 kroner after it
posted first quarter profit of 357 million kroner ($60.2
million), beating the average analyst estimate of 329.8 million
kroner. Norway’s second-largest insurer reported a 29 percent
jump in net premium income to 11.2 billion kroner.  Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JMT)  rallied 6.8 percent to 18.10
euros, its highest price since at least February 1993, after
Portugal’s biggest retailer reported first-quarter revenue of
2.77 billion euros, beating the average analyst estimate of 2.71
billion euros. Earnings also exceeded analysts’ forecasts as the
company maintained its 2013 outlook.  France Telecom  France Telecom  SA climbed 2.7 percent to 8.01 euros. The
country’s largest phone company said it will focus on cutting
costs this year as competition from Iliad SA forced phone bills
down. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell 9 percent to 3.12 billion euros.  A gauge of basic resources companies rose the most of the
19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600 as base metals rebounded.
 Rio Tinto (RIO)  added 3.2 percent to 3,000.5 pence. Kazakhmys Plc
surged 7.1 percent to 359 pence and BHP Billiton increased 1.8
percent to 1,812.5 pence.  Heineken NV tumbled 5.1 percent to 54.77 euros for the
biggest decline on the Stoxx 600. The world’s third-largest
brewer reined back its expectations for annual growth after
posting an unexpected drop in first-quarter sales.  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  slid 5.5 percent to 3.97 euros. Italy’s
largest defense company reported a loss of 828 million euros
last year because of 1.4 billion euros in writedowns on assets,
according to a statement yesterday after markets closed. The
loss compared with a deficit of 2.3 billion euros a year
earlier.  Commerzbank AG sank for a fourth day. Germany’s second-
largest lender fell 3.5 percent to 10.40 euros, its lowest price
