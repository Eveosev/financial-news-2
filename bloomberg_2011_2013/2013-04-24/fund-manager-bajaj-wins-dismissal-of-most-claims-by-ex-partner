Yashwant Bajaj, co-founder of
hedge-fund firm Hachiman Capital Management, won dismissal of
most claims against him by a former partner who said he was
shortchanged after the two decided to shut their Singapore
company.  Toru Ueda claimed his former partner made an unauthorized
debit after they decided to close the fund. That claim was
struck out by a Singapore High Court assistant registrar,
according to an April 19 order.  Ueda alleged that the unauthorized debit arose after Bajaj
wrongfully transferred $458,965 to his Juggernaut Capital
Management Pte and incurred a trading loss of $247,197, which
wasn’t accounted for, according to Ueda’s lawsuit.  Ueda declined to comment when contacted by phone. Ueda
still has a $77,000 claim against Bajaj with respect to loss
allocations in the Hachiman Japan Fund, Bajaj’s lawyer Suresh Nair said in a phone interview.  Total assets under management for Asian  hedge funds  fell
7.8 percent to $135.5 billion in 2012, underscoring the
challenges in raising capital, according to Singapore-based GFIA
Pte, which advises on hedge-fund investments.  The case is Toru Ueda v Yashwant Bajaj. S205/2013.
