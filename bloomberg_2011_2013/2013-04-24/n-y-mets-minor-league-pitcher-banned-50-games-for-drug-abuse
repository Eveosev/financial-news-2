New York  Mets minor-league pitcher
Christian Montgomery has been suspended for 50 games without pay
by  Major League Baseball  for a second violation of the sport’s
drug rules.  Montgomery, who is on the roster of the rookie-level
Kingsport Mets, had a second positive test for a “drug of
abuse,” Major League Baseball said in a news release. His ban
will begin at the start of the Appalachian League season.  The  20-year-old Montgomery  was selected by the Mets in the
11th round of the 2011 First-Year Player Draft out of high
school in Indianapolis. The right-hander went 0-1 with a 9.39
earned run average in two starts last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
