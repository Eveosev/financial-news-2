Rubber gained for the first time in
three days as  Japan ’s currency dropped to near a four-year low
against the dollar, boosting the appeal of yen-based contracts.  Rubber for delivery in September climbed as much as 2.4
percent to 255.2 yen a kilogram ($2,570 a metric ton) and was at
253 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:58 a.m. The
contract for October delivery, listed on the bourse today,
traded at 255 yen after opening at 253.7 yen.  The yen dropped to 99.76 per dollar in Tokyo, nearing a
four-year low of 99.95 reached on April 11, amid prospects the
 Bank of Japan  will renew its commitment to monetary stimulus at
a meeting this week.  “A weak yen is the largest support to rubber futures,”
said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp.
in Tokyo. “Speculation is growing that the currency will weaken
to 100 per dollar or below in the short term.”  The BOJ will hold a policy meeting on April 26 after
unveiling a plan earlier this month to double its holdings of
 government bonds  in the next two years. It may upgrade its
outlook on consumer-price gains excluding fresh food to at least
1.5 percent from 0.9 percent for fiscal 2014, according to
people familiar with the central bank’s discussions.  Rubber for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 1.1 percent to 18,660  yuan  ($3,020) a ton.  Thai rubber free-on-board gained 1 percent to 81.30 baht
($2.82) a kilogram yesterday, according to Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . The nation, the world’s largest producer,
is working on plans to reduce supply and increase demand to
stabilize prices, Amnuay Patise, head of a working group for the
government, said April 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
