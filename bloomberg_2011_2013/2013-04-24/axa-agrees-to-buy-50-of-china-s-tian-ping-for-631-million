Axa SA (CS) , Europe’s second-largest
insurer, agreed to acquire a 50 percent stake in Chinese auto
insurer Tian Ping in a deal valued at 485 million euros ($631
million) as it expands in Asia.  Axa will buy 33 percent of Shanghai-based Tian Ping from
its existing shareholders for 237 million euros, and it will
also invest 248 million euros in a capital increase “to support
future growth,” the Paris-based insurer said in an e-mailed
statement today. Axa’s other Chinese property and casualty
businesses will be integrated into the new joint venture.  The deal “is another stepping stone towards our ambition
to accelerate further in high-growth markets,” Chief Executive
Officer Henri de Castries said in the statement.  Axa rose as much as 2.5 percent in Paris trading and gained
2.4 percent to 13.98 euros by 11:21 a.m. local time. The shares
have risen 4.6 percent this year, trailing the 7.4 percent
increase of the 28-member Bloomberg  Europe  500 Insurance Index.  In July, Axa won approval from regulators to start a life-
insurance venture with  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398) 
Ltd. Since 2010, Axa has freed up billions of euros in capital
in countries such as the U.S.,  Canada  and the U.K. while
expanding in Asia and other  emerging markets .  Tian Ping, created in 2004, has more than 5,000 employees
at 62 offices in 18 Chinese provinces. It also has a license to
sell insurance over the Internet, which represented about 20
percent of its premiums in 2011, according to the statement.  Tian Ping’s total premiums in 2011 rose to 447 million
euros, up 28 percent from a year earlier, according to the
statement. The company’s premiums represent 0.8 percent of
 China ’s property and casualty market. Tian Ping had a 2011
profit of 28 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
