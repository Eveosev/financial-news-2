Italy ’s government bonds fell, with
two-year notes dropping for the first time in seven days, amid
speculation lawmakers will still struggle to resolve the
nation’s debt crisis even after ending a political impasse.  Two-year yields climbed from a record low as Enrico Letta,
deputy secretary of the country’s biggest political party, was
designated prime minister and said he will begin consultations
to form a government. German bonds rose as an industry report
showed business confidence in the nation worsened in April,
increasing speculation the European Central Bank will cut
interest rates next month.  Germany  sold 2 billion euros ($2.6
billion) of 30-year bunds at a record-low yield.  “This may be just a reversal of what we’ve seen in the
last few days,” said Owen Callan, an analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) 
in Dublin. “They obviously seem to be putting together some
form of government in Italy and while this may get something in
the short term, the longer-term future is still quite
uncertain.”  Italy’s  two-year yield  rose 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 1.27 percent at 4:25 p.m. London time after
falling to 1.125 percent yesterday, the lowest since Bloomberg
began compiling data on the securities in 1993. The 6 percent
note due November 2014 fell 0.21, or 2.10 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 107.215.  Political Vacuum  The two-year yield has fallen from a euro-era record 8.121
percent in November 2011 amid speculation lawmakers will follow
through on austerity plans to resolve the nation’s debt crisis
even as inconclusive elections on Feb. 24-25 resulted in a
political vacuum.  “I am appealing to all political forces and their sense of
responsibility,” Letta said today at the presidential palace in
 Rome  after being appointed by President Giorgio Napolitano.
“All of the essential reforms must be done together with the
largest possible participation.”  The  10-year yield  climbed six basis points to 4.01 percent
after dropping to 3.89 percent yesterday, the lowest level since
October 2010.  The Italian Treasury sold 2.5 billion euros of zero-coupon
two-year notes today at a record-low yield of 1.167 percent.
Investors bid for 1.66 times the amount offered, compared with
1.43 times at an auction last month. The nation also sold 750
million euros of 10-year inflation-linked bonds.  Bunds Gain  German bunds gained after the Ifo institute said its
business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives,
dropped to 104.4 this month from 106.7 in March. Economists in a
Bloomberg News survey forecast a decline to 106.2.  Germany auctioned 30-year bunds at an average yield of 2.16
percent, down from 2.45 percent at the previous sale of Jan. 30.
Investors submitted bids for 2.598 billion euros of the
securities, compared with the target of 2 billion euros, the
Bundesbank said.  The benchmark  10-year yield  fell two basis points to 1.24
percent after declining to 1.19 percent yesterday, the lowest
level since July 24.  UBS AG, Rabobank International, Nomura and  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  all changed their forecasts to predict the
ECB will cut interest rates after a report yesterday showed
euro-area output contracted for a 15th month.  The central bank will reduce its main  refinancing rate  by
25 basis points to 0.5 percent at its next meeting on May 2, the
banks said. Twenty-one of 36 economists in a Bloomberg News
 survey  forecast a rate cut next week.  ‘Non-Existent’  “I don’t know why the ECB haven’t cut rates already,”
said Robin Marshall, a director of fixed income at Smith &
Williamson Investment Management in London, which oversees about
$20 billion. “Inflation is within their target, growth is
virtually non-existent in the euro zone, they’re going to have
to cut again.”  Italian bonds returned 4.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds gained 0.7 percent and Spain’s rose 7.4 percent.  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Ireland and Italy, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
