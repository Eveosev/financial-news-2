Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark stock index
climbed the most since 2009 as  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC 
surged to a seven-year high after profit beat estimates and
 Etisalat (ETISALAT)  planned a bid for  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s  Maroc Telecom (IAM)  stake.  The ADX General Index rose 2.1 percent to 3,254.07 at the
close in the United Arab Emirates capital.  National Bank of Abu
Dhabi  surged 5.4 percent. Emirates Telecommunications Corp., or
Etisalat as the company is known, climbed the most since
December 2009.  Twenty-two stocks climbed, six fell and 34 were unchanged,
as more than  225 million shares  were traded, compared with a 12-
month daily average of 84 million shares, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Sharjah Islamic Bank (NBS)  soared the most
since March 2008, on almost nine times the three-month daily
average volume.  “The main catalyst has been strong anticipation for first-
quarter numbers across the board,” said  Marwan Shurrab ,  fund
manager  and chief trader at Gulfmena Investments Ltd in Dubai.
National Bank of Abu Dhabi’s earnings “had a big part in the
overall performance,” he said.  First-quarter profit climbed to 1.41 billion dirhams ($384
million) from 1.04 billion dirhams as operating income advanced
24 percent. The mean estimate of five analysts was for a profit
of 1.1 billion dirhams,  according to data compiled  by Bloomberg.  Beating Peers  “The only note here is that the beat came from noncore
revenues mainly investment income which makes sense as” the
U.A.E. markets are outperforming regional peers this year,
Shurrab said.  Abu Dhabi’s gauge has gained 24 percent this year, while
Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  added 27 percent. Qatar’s QE Index has
climbed 4 percent and Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index
rose 5 percent.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi rose to 11.7 dirhams, the
highest since January 2006. Etisalat surged 4 percent to 10.45
dirhams.  The company, one of two Middle Eastern carriers that have
expressed interest in acquiring Vivendi’s 53 percent holding in
Maroc Telecom, said it plans to submit a binding bid by today’s
deadline. Etisalat has secured funding from local and
international banks, it said.  Sharjah Islamic Bank advanced 14.9 percent to 11.16
dirhams. The lender, which complies with Islam’s ban on
interest, said first-quarter profit rose to 84.8 million dirhams
from 82.7 million dirhams a year earlier.  Dana Gas PJSC (DANA) , gained 4.2 percent, the most since April 11,
to 50 fils. The fuel producer said yesterday its creditors and
shareholders agreed on the refinancing terms for the company’s
Islamic bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
