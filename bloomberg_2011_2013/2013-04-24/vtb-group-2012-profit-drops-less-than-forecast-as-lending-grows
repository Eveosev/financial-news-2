VTB Group said profit fell 4
percent percent last year, a smaller drop than analysts forecast
as  Russia ’s second-biggest bank boosted lending.  Net income attributable to shareholders declined to 85.8
billion rubles ($2.7 billion) from 89.4 billion rubles a year
earlier, the Moscow-based bank said in a statement today. That
beat an average estimate of 78.9 billion rubles from eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Gross loans increased 10.8 percent last year to 5.1
trillion rubles. The lender said its Tier 1 capital ratio, a
measure of financial strength, rose to 10.3 percent from 9
percent at the start of the year. The share of non-performing
loans was unchanged compared with Dec. 31, 2011 at 5.4 percent.
The bank’s net interest margin, which measures the profit margin
on lending, rose 4.2 percent in the year.  “We made considerable progress in strengthening capital
and optimizing risk in our asset base,” VTB Chief Executive
Officer Andrey Kostin said in the statement.  VTB shares listed in Moscow jumped 1.6 percent to 4.6
kopeks as of 11:43 a.m. in Moscow. The  Micex Index (VTBMICX)  rose 1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
