European Central Bank governing
council member Jens Weidmann warned euro members against easing
their commitment to the euro region’s debt rules, singling out
 France  as the country that most needs to lead by example.  Giving countries that are in bailout programs more time to
carry out economic-policy changes means providing them with
bigger funds from bailout coffers and possibly even transfers
from donor countries, which need political acceptance, Weidmann
said today at a savings banks conference in Dresden,  Germany .  “The non-program countries should not repeat the mistakes
of 2004 and interpret the reinforced Stability and Growth Pact
too flexibly in its first test,” Weidmann said, referring to
the agreed rules of the euro. “France especially has an
important role model function for the credibility of rules and
confidence in the sustainability of public finances.”  French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said today that he
saw a global consensus emerging at Group of 20 meetings last
week on the pace of budget deficit reduction and that France’s
strategy “corresponds to dominant concerns internationally.”
France’s approach is about “sustainable finances, structural
reforms but also about not stifling growth,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
