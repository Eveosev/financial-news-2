Women in the U.K. opposition  Labour Party  complained that its leader,  Ed Miliband , is keeping them out of the media while Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Tories appear to give their fewer female lawmakers more of a voice.  A group from the Women’s Parliamentary Labour Party met an aide to Miliband yesterday to press their case to be considered more often when broadcasters ask for opposition representatives to appear to talk about Labour policies.  “It is important that the breadth of the party is reflected in the media,” Labour lawmaker Meg Hillier said in a telephone interview. “It feels like we are seeing fewer women than sometimes in the past. I don’t think that’s intentional, but we need to hold the feet of the party to the fire and ensure that our women are visible in the media.”  Labour has the biggest proportion of women in Parliament, with 86 to 169 men, while the Tories have 47 women and 257 men. Cameron said in February there are “not nearly enough” senior women in government and has fallen short of his own pledge to fill a third of Cabinet positions with female lawmakers. In his ministerial reorganization last September, the number of women in the Cabinet fell to four from five.  Labour has 43 women in “front-bench” positions, acting as official party spokeswomen in the House of Commons. Cameron’s party has 12 and his junior coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats have three, out of a parliamentary party that includes seven women and 50 men. The Commons has 146 female lawmakers out of a total of 650.  The chairwoman of the women’s Labour lawmakers’ group, Fiona MacTaggart, declined to comment when contacted by phone.  Labour wants to highlight the brilliance of women from across the parliamentary party in both the media and on the front bench, a party aide said by telephone, declining to be named in line with Labour policy. Labour has led on women’s representation and is standing up for women across the country, while the Tories are being abandoned by them over government cuts to family budgets, the aide said.
