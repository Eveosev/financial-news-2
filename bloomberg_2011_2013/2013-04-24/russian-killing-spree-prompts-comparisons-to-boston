Russians had a tragic opportunity
this week to compare the bombing in  Boston  with a killing spree
on their own soil. The juxtaposition was not flattering.  Exactly a week after the Boston marathon bombing, a man
walked into a hunting gear store in the southern Russian town of
Belgorod and gunned down the three men behind the counter. He
killed three more people on the street, including two
schoolgirls aged 14 and 16, before escaping in a BMW X5 that he
later crashed into another car. Police arrested the suspect --
Sergei Pomazun, a 31-year-old ex-convict -- Tuesday evening
after a two-day search.  The shooting, which claimed twice as many lives as the
Boston attack, made no headlines outside Russia. Within Russia,
it became an occasion for self-examination.  “Why are we like this, taking the Boston tragedy to heart
and looking at the Belgorod one as if it is nothing out of the
ordinary?”  wrote  Twitter user Galina Abramova.  Russian police received no applause for their efforts,
despite the fact that they apprehended their suspect faster than
their U.S. counterparts managed to catch Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who,
with his brother Tamerlan, is suspected of planning the Boston
bombing.  Russia ’s police force is notoriously corrupt and
unpopular. Even the most knowledgeable commentators almost
immediately started accusing them, fairly or not, of botching
the operation.  Journalist Yulia Kalinina, who has covered terrorism and
crime for more than a decade, noted that police could have
captured Pomazun right away, given that he was identified
immediately: the BMW belonged to his father and the woman whose
car he hit recognized him in a photo. In a  column  headlined “Why
Boston Is Not Belgorod” in the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets,
Kalinina marveled that Belgorod residents were allowed to come
to the crime scene with flowers and toys and attend packed
church services for the victims while the killer was still at
large. She pointed out that Belgorod authorities offered a
reward of 3 million rubles (about $100,000) for the suspect’s
capture, a gesture that was unnecessary in Boston because the
police “just did their job.”  “Let those who need the money track killers,” Kalinina
wrote sarcastically. “Why should the police worry about it?”  President  Vladimir Putin  got his share of criticism, too.
Radio journalist Vladimir Varfolomeyev  wrote  in his LiveJournal
blog that Putin sent his condolences to the U.S. 12 hours after
the Boston attack, but never said a public word about the
Belgorod shooting. Putin’s press secretary Dmitri Peskov said
only that “the president was informed” about the incident,
 according  to the RIA Novosti news agency.  The contrast stirred bitterness among Russians nostalgic
for the country’s former superpower status. “It’s
understandable: In Boston it was the Chechens who made a mess,
so we had to apologize to the mighty Americans lest they
misunderstand,” nationalist blogger Yegor Prosvirnin  wrote  on
LiveJournal. “And Russian trash -- who is counting their dead
anyway? Now if they had a country of their own with a military
and nuclear missiles, they’d be worth taking off one’s hat for.”  Varfolomeyev reasoned that it was hard to blame Putin if
ordinary Russians seemed more interested in the Boston drama
than in what was going on in their own country. “During this
rather dramatic week I posted several large photo reports from
Boston and Belgorod,” he  wrote . “Today I compared the stats: The
Belgorod pictures were ’liked’ and reposted about one-tenth as
much as the Boston ones were.”  One constructive consequence was an outburst of impassioned
calls for stricter  gun control  in the media and on social
networks. Even those, however, betrayed a sense of despair.
Here’s how Galina Panfilova, head of Transparency
International’s Moscow office,  explained  in a Facebook post the
dangers of carrying a gun: “In this social system, with its
boorishness, aggression, sudden altercations about anything and
everything, universal suspicion and mass phobias, I do not even
trust myself.”  In a country where people are so good at beating themselves
up, who needs terror?  (Leonid Bershidsky, an editor and novelist, is Moscow
