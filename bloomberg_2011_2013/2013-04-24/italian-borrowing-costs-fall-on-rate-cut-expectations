Italy’s borrowing costs dropped at
an auction today as investors pushed market yields to record
lows on speculation that the  European Central Bank  may cut
 interest rates  and the country will soon have a government.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 2.5 billion euros ($3.25
billion) of zero-coupon bonds at a record-low 1.167 percent,
down from 1.746 percent at the previous auction on March 25.
Investors bid for 1.66 times the amount offered, compared with
1.43 times last month. The Treasury also sold 750 million euros
of inflation-linked bonds due 2023 at 2.65 percent, down from
3.230 percent on March 25.  “In the current environment of expansionary monetary
policy, we continue to favor roll-down strategies, we prefer
selling the three-month area and buying 2014 to 2015 bonds,”
 Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit
Global Research in Milan, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Euro-area services and factory output shrank for a 15th
month in April, according to Markit Economics, increasing
expectations the ECB will cut interest rates to boost the
economy. ECB executive board member Joerg Asmussen said April 20
that the bank may cut borrowing costs if data show a need for
it.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped below 4 percent on April
22 for the first time since November 2010. Ten-year yields today
were little changed at 3.95 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
