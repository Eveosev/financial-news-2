A measure of swings in  Malaysia ’s
ringgit rose to a 10-month high as doubts over the outcome of
the May 5 elections unsettled markets. The local currency and
government bonds advanced.  The gauge advanced for an 11th day and has risen more than
a percentage point this week after campaigning for the polls,
which Citigroup Inc. predicts will be the closest in the
nation’s history, began on April 20. Prime Minister Najib Razak,
whose alliance has been in power since the nation’s independence
in 1957, is seeking a mandate to continue with a $444 billion
economic development program.  “There’s still uncertainty on the part of markets about
what the election outcome will be,” said Khoon Goh, a senior
strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in
 Singapore . “Given that Malaysia has never had a change in
government before, that just adds another layer of uncertainty
if there were a surprise result.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, rose 18 basis points,
or 0.18 percentage point, to 8.70 percent, as of 4:25 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge
touched 8.94 percent, the highest level since June 15, 2012.  The ringgit gained 0.2 percent to 3.0505 per dollar, after
falling 0.7 percent in the last two days, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The yield on the 3.26 percent government notes
due March 2018 dropped one basis point to 3.17 percent,
according to figures compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
