China ’s plan to cut sugar imports
by stockpiling the sweetener is backfiring as traders are
importing even more because government purchases from local
producers are helping keep domestic prices high.  Sugar imports into China were 1.26 million metric tons in
the first six months of the season through March,  customs data 
showed. That’s more than the 1 million tons the U.S. Department
of Agriculture’s  Foreign Agricultural Service   estimated  the
nation would bring in for the whole season. Chinese sugar
futures were 5,132  yuan  ($831) a ton today. That’s 66 percent
more than the futures traded on NYSE Liffe in London.  “The government’s stockpiling program is indirectly
encouraging more imports,” Toby Cohen, a director at London-
based sugar merchant Czarnikow Group Ltd., said in a telephone
interview April 23. “This time last year we thought Chinese
imports in 2013 would be about 1.5 million tons. Now it looks as
if imports could be about a million tons higher.”  China’s State Council agreed to buy 300,000 tons of local
sugar for stockpiles to ensure farmer interests and stabilize
production, reducing the need for imports, Jia Zhiren, head of
the China Sugar Association, said on April 21. The nation had
already bought 1.5 million tons for inventories this year.  Brazil , the world’s largest sugar producer, shipped 945,615
tons of sugar to China from October to March, according to data
from SA Commodities and Unimar Agenciamentos Maritimos Ltd.
That’s more than double the 469,900 tons shipped in the same
period in 2011-12, when China was the world’s biggest importer
of the raw sweetener. In the first six months of 2010-11,
cargoes from Brazil to the Asian nation totaled 97,000 tons, the
data showed.  China Imports  Imports into China are rising even if the sugar isn’t
needed for consumption, Paris-based trader Sucres et Denrees SA,
which ships more than 8 million tons of sweetener a year, said
in a quarterly report on April 3. The nation will bring in 2.72
million tons this year, Brisbane, Australia-based researcher
Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty. estimates.  Global raw sugar exports were a record 7.2 million tons in
the first three months this year, up 20 percent from the
previous peak in 2010, Peter de Klerk, a London-based Czarnikow
analyst, said on April 12. Global sugar consumption will be
174.1 million tons in 2012-13, up 1.8 million tons from a
November forecast, Czarnikow said in a report last month, adding
that consumption is “higher than the market is estimating.”  “Physical demand has been supporting price,” Czarnikow’s
Cohen said. “Trade in the first quarter hit a new record.”  Production Forecast  China is likely to continue importing sugar in the second
quarter as production there will be smaller than initially
thought, according to Green Pool. Output will be 13 million tons
in 2012-13, down from a forecast of 13.7 million tons before the
season started, said Tom McNeill, a director at the company.
Chinese production will be less than forecast as drought and low
temperatures in the southwest reduce the sugar content in the
cane, according to the China Sugar Association.  Global sugar supplies will be 8.5 million tons higher than
demand in 2012-13, a third year of surpluses, according to the
 International Sugar Organization . The London-based group had
previously expected excess supplies of 6.2 million tons, it said
on Feb. 21. Raw sugar futures traded on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York  fell 11 percent this year after slipping 16 percent in 2012
and 27 percent a year earlier. A third year of declines would
mean the longest price slump since 1992.  “We still have a sizable surplus this year and there is
no way China alone will fix it, but the imports have boosted
demand and that was somewhat unexpected,” Green Pool’s McNeill
said. “China is one of the few bright spots in the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
