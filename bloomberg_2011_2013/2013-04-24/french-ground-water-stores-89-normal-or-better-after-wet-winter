French ground-water reservoirs and
aquifers were at normal or better levels in 89 percent of cases
by April 1 after a rainy autumn and winter resulted in the
highest recharge rate in more than 10 years, the country’s
geological service BRGM reported.  “Very satisfactory” ground-water levels mean the summer
period can be approached “more serenely” than last year, the
Orleans, France-based office wrote in a  report  on its website
today. A year ago, 89 percent of ground-water reservoirs and
aquifers were below normal.  Drought last year prompted restrictions on water use in at
least 50 of  France ’s 96 mainland departments, according to the
 Environment Ministry . At least 29 departments implemented bans
on using water for agriculture. The nation is the largest grain
producer among the European Union’s 27 members.  The level of ground-water reservoirs “is a reason to
rejoice after more than a dozen years of weak or average
recharge for the underground water resources,” BRGM said.
“Last year at the same time, the ground-water reservoirs were
showing a completely opposite picture.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
