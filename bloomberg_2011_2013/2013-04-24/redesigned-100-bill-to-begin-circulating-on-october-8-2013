The new $100 bill, redesigned with
security features such as a blue, three-dimensional security
ribbon, will begin circulating Oct. 8, according to the  Federal
Reserve .  The new bill “will be easier for the public to
authenticate but more difficult for counterfeiters to
replicate,” the Fed said in a release today in Washington. New
bills are produced by the  Bureau of Engraving and Printing  and
distributed through the financial system by the Fed.  The design of the bill, which can be seen at the website
newmoney.gov, was unveiled in 2010. Due to a malfunction in the
printing process, the release of the bills was delayed. As of
April 17, currency in circulation totaled $1.18 trillion
according to Fed data.  The central bank’s currency education program “is reaching
out to businesses and consumers around the world to raise
awareness about the new design and inform them about how to use
its security features.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
