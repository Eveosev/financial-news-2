Some assets from the Second Mile,
the charity founded by convicted child molester and former
 Pennsylvania  State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, will be transferred to Arrow Child & Family
Ministries.  Judge William F. Morgan in Warren, Pennsylvania, in an
April 17 order, approved a request to transfer $200,000, program
databases,  office equipment  and two vans, constituting less than
5 percent of the total assets of the Second Mile, to the
Houston-based nonprofit group that will continue the programs
for at-risk children.  “I know this has been a very difficult year for all
involved with The Second Mile and I applaud The Second Mile
board, donors and staff who worked so hard to ensure these
meaningful programs are preserved while always being mindful of
the victims of Jerry Sandusky,” Mark Tennant, the founder of
Arrow, said in an e-mailed statement.  Sandusky, 69, was found guilty in June of 45 counts of
abusing boys over a 15-year period. He was sentenced to at least
30 years in prison and is serving time in a maximum-security
facility in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Sandusky, a defensive
assistant football coach under the late  Joe Paterno , formed the
charity in 1977.  To contact the reporter on this story:
