The Miami Heat used a 12-0 run at
the start of the fourth quarter to pull away from the  Milwaukee
Bucks  before wrapping up a 98-86 win to lead their National
Basketball Association playoff series by two games to none.  Dwyane Wade  led Miami with 21 points and seven rebounds,
while  LeBron James  added 19 points and eight rebounds at
AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami.   The Heat led a determined Bucks team by two points after
the first quarter, four points at the half and by three points
with one quarter to play.  The best-of-seven series now moves to Milwaukee for games
on April 25 and 28.  Miami lost to the  Dallas Mavericks  in the NBA Finals in
2011 and beat the Oklahoma City Thunder a year ago to win their
second championship. Milwaukee is in the playoffs for the first
time in three seasons and is seeking to get past the opening
round for the only time since 2000-01.  Also tonight in the Eastern Conference, the  New York Knicks 
will try to take a 2-0 lead in games against the visiting Boston
Celtics. The Knicks haven’t won a playoff series since
1999-2000, while the Celtics in 2008 ended a 22-year wait for a
17th NBA title.  In tonight’s other game, the host Denver Nuggets hold a 1-0
lead in games over the Golden State Warriors in their Western
Conference series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
