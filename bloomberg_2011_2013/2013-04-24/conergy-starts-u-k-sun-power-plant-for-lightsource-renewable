Conergy AG (CGYK) , the German solar-energy
company, put into operation a sun-power project in southern
 England  for Lightsource Renewable Energy Ltd. that will generate
enough electricity for more than 1,000 homes.  The plant in Hampshire, that will be owned and operated by
Lightsource, Britain’s largest solar park developer, has a 4.5-
megawatt capacity comprising 18,500 solar modules, according to
an e-mailed statement today from Hamburg-based Conergy. It will
provide power to as many as 1,350 homes.  “Large-scale free-field solar plants are gaining
importance in the U.K., driven by government targets for
renewable energy generation,” Robert Goss, managing director of
Conergy U.K., said in the statement. Rising energy prices are
increasing installations and Conergy expects annual growth in
the U.K. of about 13 percent over the next few years, he said.  The U.K. is aiming for 15 percent of its energy to come
from renewable sources by 2020 from about 9.4 percent now.
Generators of solar power are eligible to receive subsidies of
about 87.5 pounds ($133.6) per megawatt-hour of electricity
produced at  current prices.   To contact the reporter on this story:
