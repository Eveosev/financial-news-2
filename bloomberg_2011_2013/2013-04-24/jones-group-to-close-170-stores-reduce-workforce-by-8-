Jones Group Inc. (JNY) , the owner of the
Jones New York, Nine West and Anne Klein fashion brands, will
close 170 stores and cut 8 percent of its workforce after first-
quarter profit trailed analysts’ estimates.  The actions will generate about $40 million in annual
pretax savings by mid-2014, New York-based Jones Group said
today in a statement. The plan will result in costs of $40
million to $60 million in the next 15 months, the company said.  Chief Executive Officer Wesley Card has been trying to turn
around Jones Group by focusing on higher-priced women’s apparel
brands like Rachel Roy and Stuart Weitzman shoes while at the
same time trying to revive the Jones New York and Anne Klein
department-store sportswear brands. The company is unveiling a
new Jones New York sportswear line in the fall.  Jones Group also reported preliminary first-quarter
adjusted profit of 15 cents a share on sales of about $1
billion. Analysts  estimated  profit of 25 cents on revenue of
$997.3 million. The company will issue its quarterly report on
May 1.  Jones Group forecast revenue of as much as $3.95 billion
this year. Analysts projected $3.97 billion.  About 850 jobs are being cut, said Sharon Stern, a Jones
Group spokeswoman who works for Joele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer
Katcher. Jones Group operated 594 stores as of Dec. 31.  Jones Group climbed 2.7 percent to $13.97 at the close in
New York. The shares have advanced 26 percent this year,
compared with a 10 percent increase for the Russell 2000 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
