Thailand ’s baht fell for a third
day on speculation the central bank will intervene to limit
gains that may hurt exports. Government bonds were steady.  The currency has strengthened 5.8 percent against the
greenback this year, the best performance in  Asia , and touched a
16-year high this week. The baht has started to move beyond its
fundamentals, Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul
said April 19, while Assistant Governor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan
said on April 22 that it has risen “too much and too quickly.”  “Monetary authorities may be worried about further
significant inflows,” said  Tsutomu Soma , manager of Rakuten
Securities Inc.’s fixed-income business unit department in  Tokyo .
“With those verbal interventions, the baht may see some
downward correction, although appreciation pressure will
probably continue.”  The baht fell 0.2 percent to 28.89 per dollar as of 9:22
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, taking
its decline this week to 0.8 percent. The currency touched 28.56
on April 22 and April 19, the strongest level since a
devaluation in July 1997 that sparked the Asian financial crisis.  Global funds bought $2.1 billion more Thai sovereign debt
than they sold this month through yesterday, taking this year’s
net purchases to $12 billion, Thai Bond Market Association data
show. Monetary easing in  Japan  has buoyed inflows. The BOT
raised its 2013 growth forecast on April 12 to 5.1 percent from
its January prediction of 4.9 percent.  Exports Improve  Exports climbed 4.6 percent in March from a year earlier,
more than the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a 2.3
percent gain, official data showed yesterday. Overseas sales
fell 5.8 percent in February.  One-month implied volatility in the baht, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.31
percent.  The yield on the 3.625 percent  government bonds  due June
2023 was steady at 3.38 percent. The government will auction 17
billion baht ($588 million) of debt due 2017 and 7 billion baht
of notes maturing 2027 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
