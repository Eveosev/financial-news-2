In a town that prides itself for innovation and entrepreneurship, a tiny neighborhood of nine city blocks has distinguished itself as an epicenter of creativity—not too shabby for a former industrial wasteland, dubbed Dogpatch because of its abundance of stray dogs at the turn of the century. Today, the only strays you'll find are designers, artists, and young entrepreneurs roaming the neat grids in search of inspiration (and good grub). The  Museum of Craft and Design just opened  it permanent home here, signaling that the neighborhood is no longer up-and-coming, but already-arrived. Serpentine  serves sophisticated comfort food (try the savory bread pudding made with gruyere, nettles, and asparagus). Another excellent eatery in the neighborhood is  Piccino , a purveyor of delicate pizzas and small plates. Beloved diner  Just for You Cafe  serves breakfast for the champions, like beignets and huevos rancheros. Climb a wall to burn off the extra fried dough at  Dogpatch Boulders . Recharge with fresh juice at  Sow . Co-owner Luisa Alberto began the venture as a pop-up "on a lark," but ended up settling down in Dogpatch. If you need a stronger potion, wait until 4 p.m. when the space converts to  Yield , a wine bar. Chocolate Lab , along with its adjacent venture Little Nib, indulges the neighbors' sweet tooth. For more savory snacks, Dogpatch residents rely on Olivier Cordier's classic French charcuterie,  Olivier's Butchery . Piccino's coffee bar  keeps Dogpatch caffeinated. Homegrown  Rickshaw Bagworks  creates customizable messager bags and canvas totes.
