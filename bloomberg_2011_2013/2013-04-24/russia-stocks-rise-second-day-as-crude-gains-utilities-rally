Russian  stocks  climbed for a second
day as crude oil advanced and power shares gained.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.4 percent to 1,345.45 by 10:08 a.m.
in Moscow. OAO Inter RAO UES increased 2.1 percent to 1.18
kopeks, while OAO RusHydro jumped 2.4 percent to 50.15 kopeks.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations on an
estimated price basis among 21  emerging markets  tracked by
Bloomberg. Crude,  Russia ’s chief export earner, gained for the
fifth day, adding 0.7 percent to $89.76 per barrel in  New York .
Utilities rallied the most among nine industry groups, adding
1.5 percent on average. The 14-day  relative strength index  for
the Micex rose to 27.6. A value below 30 signals the gauge is
oversold and set for a rebound.  The S&P GSCI Spot Index of commodities increased 0.4
percent. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  traded up 0.6 percent
at 1,341.21.  The number of shares traded on the Micex was 19 percent
above its 30-day average, while the gauge’s 10-day price swings
fell to 13.009.  The measure trades at 5 times its 12-month estimated
earnings and has lost 8.7 percent this year, compared with a
10.3 multiple for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) , which has
dropped 3.7 percent in the period.  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
 stock futures , slipped 1.5 percent to 23.30, falling for a
second day. The Market Vectors Russia ETF, the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, was little changed at 25.67
yesterday, while the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  added 0.8
percent to 90.57.  To contact the reporter on this story:
