Schools and businesses closed in
Karachi, the commercial capital of  Pakistan , after a political 
party urged people to stay home to protest a bombing that 
killed two of its volunteers.  Gas stations covered their premises with shrouds and
passengers crammed the few public buses that ran their routes on
Karachi’s streets. Similar closures occurred in the cities of
Sukkur and Mirpurkhas, the news channel Geo TV reported.  The shutdown across the southern province of Sindh came in
response to a call from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement political
party to protest the attack yesterday. Karachi’s biggest
political party said its offices will remain closed until
authorities can guarantee the safety of its workers and
volunteers ahead of national elections set for May 11.  “We can either be part of the elections or carry the dead
on our shoulders,” party leader Muhammad Raza Haroon said.  Yesterday’s attack, which police spokesman Imran Shaukat
said also wounded 15 people, targeted MQM volunteers who were
posting party banners around Karachi. Television footage from
the scene showed a destroyed motorcycle and blood spattered on a
road.  The Karachi attack occurred an hour after a suicide bombing
killed six people and wounded 45 more in the western city of
Quetta, the  Dawn  newspaper said. Another bombing outside a
Quetta hospital wounded 13 people this morning, Geo reported.
There was no immediate sign that the attacks were connected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
