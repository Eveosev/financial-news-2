The Brazilian  development bank 
known as BNDES is planning to sell about 6.1 billion reais ($3
billion) of  nonperforming loans  to investors.  BNDES already opened the request for tender to define which
firm would be the adviser on the asset sale, the government-
owned bank said on its website. The 6.1 billion reais represents
the value of 1,020 loans on the day the borrowers defaulted,
plus two months’ interest.  They would be valued at 37 billion reais when accounting
for inflation, penalties and accrued interest on the loans, some
of which are more than 20 years overdue, according to BNDES.
Investors seek to turn a profit by recouping money from
borrowers after buying the soured loans at a steep discount.  The bank said it’s still fighting in court to recover what
it lost, and declined to comment beyond the information provided
on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
