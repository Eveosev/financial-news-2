Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , Southeast
Asia’s biggest carrier, will raise its stake in  Virgin Australia (VAH) 
Holdings Ltd., deepening an alliance to take on the dominance of
 Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  in the local market.  Singapore Air will buy 255.5 million Virgin Australia
shares owned by Virgin Group for A$122.6 million ($126 million),
or 48 Australian cents apiece, the carrier said in an e-mailed
statement today. The purchase -- at a 5.5 percent premium to
yesterday’s closing price -- will lift Singapore Air’s stake in
Virgin to 19.9 percent from 10 percent.  Singapore Air and Virgin Australia are widening their
alliance to challenge the Qantas, which controls about 65
percent of the domestic travel market. Virgin Australia
yesterday got approval to buy 60 percent of the local unit of
 Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd. (TGR)   Virgin Australia Chief Executive Officer John Borghetti is
targeting corporate customers with business class seats and
upgraded lounges as part of his strategy to take on Qantas.  Virgin Australia advanced as much as 2.2 percent to 46.5
cents, and traded at 46 cents as of 11:29 a.m. in Sydney.
Singapore Air fell 0.4 percent to S$10.61 in the city.  The acquisition will depend on approval from Australia’s
Foreign Investment Review Board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
