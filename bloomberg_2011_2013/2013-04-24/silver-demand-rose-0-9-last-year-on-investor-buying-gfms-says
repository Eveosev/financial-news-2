Silver demand climbed 0.9 percent
in 2012 as investors bought exchange-traded products backed by
the metal,  Thomson Reuters  GFMS Ltd. said.  Demand rose to 1.048 billion ounces from 1.039 billion a
year earlier, GFMS said in a report published today by the
Washington-based  Silver Institute . Investors bought 160 million
ounces as the value of holdings in ETPs rose to a record $18.9
billion at yearend, up 16 percent from a year earlier, the
report said.  Prices gained 8.3 percent in New York last year as the
U.S., China and  Japan  announced stimulus measures to shore up
their economies, boosting the appeal of precious metals as a
store of value. The metal has plunged 24 percent in 2013 as
subdued inflation and a rally in equities cut demand. Slowing
growth in  China , the world’s second-biggest buyer, may crimp
silver’s use in industrial applications.  “Silver took a tumble along with gold, and concerns about
China remain,” Neil Meader, the global head of metal analytics
in  London  at GFMS, said in a telephone interview before the
report was released. “We expect prices to rebound as the safe-
haven buying will re-emerge because of global economic worries.
Also, the appetite for silver ETPs remains strong.”  Prices will average $28.50 an ounce in 2013 compared with
$31.15 last year, Meader said. Silver futures for July delivery
dropped 2.2 percent to $22.866 on the Comex in New York
yesterday.  Silver ETPs  Silver assets in global ETPs reached a record 19,738.2
metric tons in March, and are up 2.8 percent this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Investors have preferred silver to
gold in 2013, as holdings in bullion-backed ETPs have dropped 12
percent.  Fabrication demand slipped 6.6 percent to 846.8 million
ounces last year because of a slowdown in several economies,
GFMS said. Coin and medal purchases slumped 22 percent to 92.7
million ounces, while jewelry purchases slid 0.5 percent to
185.6 million ounces. Use in photography declined 13 percent to
57.8 million ounces, GFMS said.  Mine output rose 4 percent to 787 million ounces, the
researcher said. Government sales of the precious metal fell 38
percent to a 7.4 million ounces. Scrap supplies slipped 1.6
percent to 253.9 million ounces, the researcher said.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
