Pacific Investment Management Co.
cut its holdings of Spanish and Italian government debt starting
last month after a rally in the securities, according toAndrew Balls, the London-based head of European  portfolio management .  “We’ve been reducing credit risk in our portfolios and in
recent weeks we’ve cut Italy and  Spain ,” Balls said today in a
telephone interview. “It’s a function of levels and
fundamentals. The spreads look reasonable but not as attractive
as they were.”  The sales took holdings of the securities close to
“neutral” after  Newport Beach , California-based Pimco
increased its position to “overweight” last year, Balls said,
meaning it now owns about the same amount of the securities as
the index that it uses to measure performance.  The change in Pimco’s position was reported by the Wall
Street Journal earlier today.  Italy’s two-year note yield fell to a record-low 1.125
percent yesterday, down from 1.99 percent on Dec. 31 and as high
as 8.12 percent in November 2011. The yield climbed nine basis
points to 1.25 percent today.  Spanish bonds have handed investors a return of 7.4 percent
this year through yesterday and Italian debt gained 4.2 percent,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
