Two of  Japan ’s cabinet ministers
were appointed advisers to a pro-gambling group of politicians,
possibly smoothing the way for the legalization of casinos after
past efforts failed to gain sufficient lawmaker support.  Trade Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Education Minister
Hakubun Shimomura were named to the group’s advisory panel,
which already includes Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Deputy
Prime Minister Taro Aso, according to a statement distributed at
a meeting of the association today.  The high-level of support for casinos comes four months
after the electoral defeat of previous Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda , who publicly opposed considering the idea. Members of the
group plan to introduce legislation that would set guidelines
for legalizing casinos after the upper house elections in July,
when a coalition led by Abe’s  Liberal Democratic Party  hopes to
seize a majority.  “This whole ’Casino, let’s get it legalized’ matter has
been going on for more than a decade, but it’s coming more into
grasp,” said Kenji Okamoto, managing director for Japan of
Spectrum OSO  Asia , a gaming consultant. “The main reason is
they’re getting these ‘king-makers’ to be more involved in
moving the matter forward.”  LDP lawmakers Hiroyuki Hosada and Takeshi Iwaya were
appointed chairman and secretary-general of the pro-gambling
group at today’s meeting, its first since the party came to
power.  Motegi and Shimomura had been members of the group before
their appointments today. The heavy involvement of cabinet
members in the group “shows the cabinet’s stance on casinos,”
Shimomura said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
