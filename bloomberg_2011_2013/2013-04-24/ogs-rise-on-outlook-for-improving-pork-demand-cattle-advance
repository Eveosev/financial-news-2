Hog prices advanced the most in a
week on signs of increasing demand for U.S. pork as temperatures
rise and consumers buy more meat for grilling. Cattle also
gained.  Wholesale  pork  prices increased 1.1 percent to 86.41 cents
a pound yesterday, the highest since Feb. 1, government data
show. The northwestern half of the Midwest has been at least 5
degrees below normal this month, and temperatures should rise to
closer to normal for the next 6 to 15 days, according to
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland . More
consumers tend to grill outdoors in warmer weather, boosting
meat demand.  “That demand has come in, and the product value is
surging,” Lou Arens, a broker at PCI Advisory Services in
Waucoma,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “Now we’re
getting the warmer weather, and we’re looking for this to
hopefully be the start of the seasonal rally.”  Hog futures for June settlement gained 1.4 percent to 90.8
cents a pound at 10:12 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
heading for the biggest increase for the most-active contract
since April 17.  Cattle futures for June delivery added 0.8 percent to
$1.2185 a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 1.6
percent to $1.5055 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
