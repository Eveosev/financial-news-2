Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the largest seller of
supplemental health insurance, said first-quarter profit
increased 14 percent as investing results improved.  Net income  rose to $892 million, or $1.90 a share, from
$785 million, or $1.68, a year earlier, the Columbus, Georgia-
based company said today in a statement. Operating profit, which
excludes some investment results, was $1.69 a share, beating the
$1.62  average estimate  of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Investment Officer Eric Kirsch, hired from Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in 2011, has scaled back bets on European
financial firms that soured amid the financial crisis. Kirsch,
52, has favored U.S. corporate bonds over Japanese government
debt in the portfolio that backs Aflac’s obligations in  Japan .  “It’s more important today, in the face of a weaker yen,
to have these U.S. dollar-denominated assets,” Edward Shields,
an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said in an
interview before results were announced. “It should ultimately
help the earnings strength from the Japanese segment.”  Aflac, led by Chief Executive Officer Dan Amos, 61, does
most of its business in Japan and converts results from yen to
dollars for reporting purposes. The yen slid 7.9 percent to
94.22 per dollar in the first three months of the year.  Aflac rose 1.8 percent to close at $51.56 in New York and
was little changed in extended trading. Shares have  fallen  2.9
percent this year, making Aflac the only decliner on the 24-
company  KBW Insurance Index. (KIX)   ‘Monitoring’ Japan  Net realized investment gains were $102 million, compared
with net losses of $29 million a year earlier.  Book value , a
measure of assets minus liabilities, fell to $33.34 per share as
of March 31, from $34.16 three months earlier, as Aflac changed
how it values some privately issued securities.  “Our investment team is carefully monitoring Japan’s
monetary and fiscal policies to evaluate investment options,”
Amos said in the statement. “Low investment yields,
particularly in Japan, remain a significant challenge. As such,
we continue to invest a significant portion of our cash flows in
U.S. corporate bonds.”  Aflac forecast operating earnings for the current quarter
that fell below some analysts’ estimates, as the weakening yen
weighs on results. Operating profit will probably be as much as
$1.56 a share in the period, the firm said, compared with the
$1.57  average estimate  of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  U.S. Sales  Sales in Japan increased as customers purchased coverage
ahead of a planned premium increase, Amos said. New annualized
premium sales rose 2.6 percent to 53.8 billion yen or $578
million in the quarter, according to the statement. That
compares with a 54 percent surge a year earlier.  In the U.S., sales declined 5.2 percent to $332 million.
Amos said U.S. sales “will be weighted more toward the latter
half of the year,” and may increase as much as 5 percent in
2013.  Aflac said it repurchased about $150 million of shares in
the first quarter, and will buy back $400 million to $600
million this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
