PT Astra International (ASII) ,  Indonesia ’s
biggest automotive retailer, said first-quarter net income
slipped 7 percent from a year earlier due to higher costs and
lower commodity prices that hurt its palm oil business.  Profit in the three-months ended March 31 declined to 4.3
trillion rupiah ($442 million), Astra said in an e-mailed
statement in Jakarta today. First-quarter sales climbed to 46.7
trillion rupiah from 46.4 trillion rupiah, it said.  The contribution from the automotive business declined
because of tougher competition and higher labor costs, said the
Jakarta-based company, even as a record-low benchmark interest
rate buoys consumer spending. Astra sells Toyota Motor Corp.
cars and Honda Motor Co. motorcycles.  “Indonesia’s economic prospects remain positive,”
President Director Prijono Sugiarto said in the statement.
“Although in the short term, Astra’s profit will be impacted by
an increase in labor costs, a weakening of commodity prices, and
competition in the automotive industry.”  Tighter downpayment rules for Shariah-compliant automotive
loans will also affect earnings, Sugiarto said.  Astra’s palm oil unit,  PT Astra Agro Lestari (AALI) , said
yesterday first-quarter net income slipped 5.7 percent from a
year ago to 356.4 billion rupiah, while heavy equipment unit, PT
United Tractors, said today net income dropped 27 percent to 1.1
trillion rupiah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
