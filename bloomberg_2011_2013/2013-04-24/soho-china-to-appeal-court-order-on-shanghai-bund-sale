Soho China Ltd.’s (410)  purchase of
stakes in a land venture on Shanghai’s historic Bund was
invalidated by a municipal court today, a decision the Chinese
developer says it plans to appeal.  The Shanghai court ordered the return of the stakes in
Zendai Wudaokou and Greentown Hesheng to the sellers,  Shanghai
Zendai Property Ltd. (755)  and Greentown China Holdings Ltd.,
according to a  statement  made by the developer to the Hong Kong
stock exchange. Beijing-based Soho China and the sellers will
appeal against the decision at the Higher People’s Court of
Shanghai, it said.  Fosun International Ltd. (656)  had sued last year over the stakes,
claiming it had pre-emptive rights to them. The Shanghai-based
company with investments in property, mining and drugs, owns the
rest of the 45,472 square meters (489,460 square feet) site.  Fosun respects the ruling and also respects the other
parties’ right to appeal, the company said in an e-mailed
response to queries. We believe that the law is fair and will
continue to defend our legal rights, according to the statement.  Soho had agreed to pay 4 billion  yuan  ($648 million) for
the stakes in December 2011. Developers in China have been
selling land and other assets for cash amid government efforts
to cool housing prices and clamp down on speculation.  Soho China fell 0.2 percent to HK$6.75 as of 3:23 p.m. in
Hong Kong trading. Zendai Property retreated 2.7 percent to
HK$0.146, while  Greentown (3900)  shares rose 2.7 percent to HK$15.22.
Fosun jumped 4.5 percent to HK$5.34.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
