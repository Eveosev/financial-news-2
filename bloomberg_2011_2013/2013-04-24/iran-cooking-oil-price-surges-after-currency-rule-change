Iranian meat and cooking  oil prices 
surged after the government stopped providing foreign currencies
at a preferential  exchange rate  to importers of essential goods,
the Tehran-based  Shargh  newspaper and other local media
reported.  Meat prices have increased 60 percent, while cooking oil
prices climbed 35 percent,  Ahmad Tavakoli , a lower house member
of parliament said in the chamber today, according to the Mehr
news agency.  Prices for other staple goods are also set to increase and
inflation will quicken, Hamid Hosseini, a member of Iran’s
Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Mines, wrote in Shargh
today.  Iran’s government has stopped allocating U.S. dollars at
the official rate of 12,260 rials to importers of staple goods,
including meat, chicken, cooking oil, sugar and rice, Shargh
said. Importers must now pay 25,000 rials per dollar, the report
said.  The new rate also applies to imports of medicine, the
Tehran-based  Jomhouri Eslami  newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
