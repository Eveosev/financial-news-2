The Bank of  Spain  wants to refine
rules spelling out how banks should classify refinanced loans,
said two people familiar with its plans.  The  regulator  wants to impose more uniform criteria for
classifying loans that have been refinanced by banks, said the
people, who asked not be identified because the information
isn’t public. Banks use some discretion when classifying their
refinanced loans and the regulator wants to set limits to that,
the people said.  Increased refinancings by banks as Spain’s economic slump
drags into its sixth year have attracted the scrutiny of
analysts concerned that the practice may disguise loan losses.
Spain’s banks have restructured about 140 billion euros ($182
billion) of loans outside the country’s real estate industry,
according to  Oliver Wyman , the consulting firm that did a stress
test of Spanish lenders last year.  El Pais reported the plans yesterday. Officials for the
Bank of Spain and Economy Ministry declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
