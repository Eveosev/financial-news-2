Koyasan Shingon Buddhism , the
Japanese owner of a cluster of World Heritage Site temples
founded in the 9th century, reported losses equal to about a
quarter of its assets after bets in the Australian dollar and
structured bonds soured.  The group had unregistered losses of 1.53 billion yen ($15
million) on financial assets of 5.79 billion yen for the year
ended March 31, according to an April 23 report commissioned by
the organization, based in Wakayama prefecture in western  Japan .
The head of the organization, Kosho Shono, resigned today to
take responsibility, Kyodo News reported.  Koyasan Shingon, whose flagship Kongobu-ji temple in Mount
Koya is listed as a National Treasure of Japan, started
investing in 2002 in an Australian dollar fund through Nomura
Securities Co., using money from member temples and followers.
The association later expanded its portfolio to products
including Nikkei index-linked debt, according to the report.  Holding the association’s fund managers responsible for the
losses “wasn’t appropriate,” because it would have been
difficult to predict the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., according to the report.  The report was commissioned in February after the
organization’s governing council asked for more transparency
about its investments.  “It was a difficult period of investing that led to
attempts at higher returns. Such movements were seen
everywhere,” said Hiroyuki Nakai, chief strategist at Tokai
Tokyo Research Center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
