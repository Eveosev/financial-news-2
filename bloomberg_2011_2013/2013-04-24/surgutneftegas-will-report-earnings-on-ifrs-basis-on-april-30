OAO Surgutneftegas,  Russia â€™s third-
largest oil producer, said it will report earnings in line with
international standards for the first time since 2001 on the
last day of the month.  The company will release profit figures based on
International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, on April
30, according to a statement on its  website  today. The results
may show the company has about $28 billion in cash, according to
a Bloomberg News poll of 13 analysts earlier this month.  Surgutneftegas, whose 1.2 million barrel-a-day output
exceeds that of the U.K., has avoided major acquisitions to
focus on Siberian oil production. The company can keep output at
that level until 2030, General Director Vladimir Bogdanov said
April 10. The company has paid out about 10 percent of income in
dividends to preferred shareholders.  The preferred shares fell as much as 1.7 percent before
paring losses to trade little changed at 20.52 rubles as of
11:52 a.m. in Moscow. That gives company a $29 billion market
capitalization.  Separately, the Surgut, Russia-based company will hold its
shareholder meeting on June 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
