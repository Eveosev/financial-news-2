Total SA bought a cargo of North
Sea Forties crude at a higher price than the previous trade.
There were no bids or offers for Urals grade for a third day.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, cuts exports of its
benchmark Qua Iboe grade to 10 cargoes in June, according to a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Total bought Forties lot F0514 from  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
for loading from May 17 to May 19 at 25 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with
a trade at a 30 cent discount on April 22.  The company also bid for Forties for loading May 6 to May
11 at 90 cents less than the cash cost of Brent, Forties,
Oseberg and Ekofisk crudes for July without finding a seller,
the survey showed.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA bid unsuccessfully for the grade
at a 30 cent discount to Dated Brent for May 17 to May 21
loading, according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days narrowed by 2 cents to a discount of 17 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the narrowest since March 20.  Brent for June settlement traded at $101.31 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $99.90 in the previous session. The July contract was at
$101.26 at the same time today, a discount of 5 cents to June.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals for a third
day, the Platts survey showed. The grade traded at a discount of
40 cents to the benchmark in the Mediterranean and minus $1.20
in northwest Europe on April 19.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 3 cents to 32 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at $1.22 a
barrel compared with $1.25 at yesterday’s close.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose 2 cents to $3.13 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Qua Iboe cargoes for June are all 950,000 barrels and
compares with 11 in May, the schedule showed.  Exports of Yoho grade will drop to one consignment in June,
compared with three for May, according to a separate plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
