The forint dropped for a sixth day,
its longest stretch in 11 months, as investors increased wagers
on further interest rate cuts from  Hungary ’s central bank.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank yesterday reduced its benchmark
rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent, a record low. The
Monetary Council may cut rates to 4 percent by July, Zoltan Arokszallasi, a Budapest-based economist at Erste Group Bank AG,
said in an e-mail today. BNP Paribas SA also forecasts an
additional 75 basis points of cuts by the “summer,” according
to an e-mailed report.  “In line with market expectations, the central bank may
keep cutting rates in the coming months,” Balint Torok, a
Budapest-based analyst at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in a
research report today.  The forint dropped 0.4 percent to 300.93 per euro by 4:33
p.m. in Budapest, paring its advance in the past month to 2
percent. Forward-rate agreements used to wager on interest in
three months fell 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, the
most in 15 months, to 3.94 percent, an all-time low. The FRA
contracts traded 69 basis points below the Budapest Interbank
Offered Rate.  Policy makers will consider further cuts if the inflation
outlook remains in line with the bank’s 3 percent target and the
improvement in  market sentiment  is sustained, according to a
statement posted on the central bank’s website yesterday.  Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds rose one
basis point to 5.377 percent, after hitting the lowest in eight
years yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
