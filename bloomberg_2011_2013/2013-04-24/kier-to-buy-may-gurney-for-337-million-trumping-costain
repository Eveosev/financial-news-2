Kier Group Plc (KIE) , the U.K. company
that helped build the Channel Tunnel rail link, agreed to buy
 May Gurney Integrated Services Plc (MAYG)  for 221 million pounds ($337
million) in cash and shares.  Shareholders of May Gurney, which maintains roads and
railways, will receive 50 pence and 0.2095 of a Kier share for
each share they own, Kier said in a statement today. The bid
amounts to 315 pence a share, 71 percent more than May Gurney’s
closing price on March 25, the day before  Costain Group Plc (COST)  made
a lower bid for the company, Kier said. Costain said it’s
considering its position.  Kier, based in Bedfordshire, is seeking to expand through
government and private-enterprise contracts, the company said in
an earnings statement today. The acquisition of May Gurney would
enable Kier to win more government contracts as cash-strapped
local authorities shift services such as road maintenance to
contractors, Kier Chief Executive Officer Paul Sheffield said in
a telephone interview.  “There’s a huge opportunity to penetrate more” local
authorities, Sheffield said. “It’s a huge market in volume and
it’s a market that’s not going to go away.”  Potential Savings  Together, Kier and May Gurney have contracts with 65 local
authorities, he said. The combination would generate pretax
savings of 20 million pounds annually starting in the financial
year ending in 2016, Kier said.  May Gurney was up 46.50 pence, or 18 percent, to 299.50
pence at the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in  London , the highest
since November 2011. Kier was down 5.2 percent at 1,199 pence,
the biggest decline since Feb. 23.  Shareholders of Norwich, England-based May Gurney will
receive a dividend of 5.6 percent a share instead of a final
dividend for the financial year ended March 31.Sheffield will
remain chief executive officer at Kier if the deal is approved
by both sets of shareholders.  Shareholders accounting for 16.5 percent of May Gurney’s
stock have agreed to accept Kier’s offer, the bidder said in a
separate statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
