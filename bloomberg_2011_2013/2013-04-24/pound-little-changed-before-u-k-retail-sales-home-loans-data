The pound rose for a third day
against the euro amid speculation the  Bank of England ’s loan-
program extension announced today will boost the economy.  Sterling strengthened to the most in more than a week
versus the 17-nation common currency before a report tomorrow
that analysts said will show the U.K. economy avoided recession
in the first quarter. The Bank of England will extend its
program to provide cheaper loans to companies and consumers by
one year, enhancing a nine-month-old plan to boost growth, the
central bank and the Treasury said today. Gilts advanced.  “The extension of the loan program is seen as sterling
positive,” said  Neil Jones , the head of European hedge fund
sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . “If successful,
it will promote growth and investment, reducing the risk that
the Bank of England has to print more money.”  Sterling appreciated 0.2 percent to 85.14 pence per euro at
4:38 p.m. London time after gaining to 84.97, the strongest
since April 12. The pound advanced 0.1 percent to $1.5258 after
sliding to $1.5197 yesterday, the lowest since April 4.  The Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme will now
last until January 2015, and will make loans to small companies
more attractive and open to non-bank lenders, the central bank
said.  German Sentiment  The pound pared gains after a report showed the
Confederation of British Industry’s  gauge  of retail sales index
unexpectedly fell this month. The measure of annual sales
slipped to minus 1 from zero in March, the business lobby group
said. Economists had forecast an increase to 8, according to the
median of eight estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Sterling also rose against the euro as a German  business
climate index  dropped to 104.4 from 106.7 March in April, a
second month of declines. Economists in a Bloomberg News  survey 
forecast a slide to 106.2, according to the median of 44
estimates.  Weak demand in the euro area, Britain’s biggest export
market, combined with a fiscal squeeze and rising unemployment
are stifling the U.K.’s economic recovery.  Fitch Ratings  cut the
nation’s rating to AA+ from AAA on April 20, citing a weaker
economic and fiscal outlook.  U.K. gross domestic product rose 0.1 percent in the three
months through March 31, failing to recover the 0.3 percent
decline in the fourth quarter of last year, according to the
median of 37 economists in a Bloomberg News  survey  before the
data is released tomorrow. From a year earlier, GDP increased
0.4 percent, the survey showed.  The pound has lost 3.3 percent this year, the second-worst
performer after the yen among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 3.7 percent and the euro rose 2 percent.  Gilt Auction  The Debt Management Office sold 1.3 billion pounds of
inflation-protected securities maturing in March 2029. The
index-linked debt was auctioned at an average yield of minus
0.635 percent, the lowest for this bond, according to the debt
office. The sale drew bids of 1.51 times the amount of
securities on offer.  The 10-year gilt yield dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.69 percent. The 1.75 percent bond due
September 2022 rose 0.25, or 2.50 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 100.55.  U.K. gilts returned 1.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds and  U.S. Treasuries  earned 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
