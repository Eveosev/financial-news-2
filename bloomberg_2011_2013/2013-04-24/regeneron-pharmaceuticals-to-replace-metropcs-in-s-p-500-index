Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN) ,
maker of the Eylea eye medicine, will replace MetroPCS
Communications Inc. in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, S&P said
in a statement today.  The change will take place after the close of trading on
April 30, S&P said.  MetroPCS is merging with Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile USA
Inc. in a transaction that is expected to leave the combined
company’s public float below the 50 percent threshold needed for
inclusion in the index, S&P said. MetroPCS shareholders approved
the sweetened deal today in a crucial vote that gives Deutsche
Telekom a chance to revive its U.S. business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
