inventories rose less than analysts estimated.  The Energy Information Administration said gasoline
supplies fell 3.93 million barrels last week to 217.8 million in

$13.4525 a bushel.  Wheat futures for July delivery declined 0.5 percent to
$6.92 a bushel.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas declined for the third straight day as

heating and power-plant fuel.  On the Nymex, gas futures for May delivery tumbled 1.7
percent to $4.166 per million British thermal units.  U.K. month-ahead gas advanced for the first time since
April 12 as forecasters predict lower-than-average temperatures
