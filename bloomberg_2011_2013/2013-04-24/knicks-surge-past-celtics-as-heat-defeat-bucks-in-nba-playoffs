Carmelo Anthony scored 34 points as
the New York Knicks used a 32-point third quarter to beat the
Boston Celtics 87-71 and open a 2-0 lead in their National
Basketball Association playoff series.  The defending-champion Miami Heat, the Eastern Conference’s
top seed, defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 98-86 to take a 2-0 lead
in their best-of-seven opening-round series. Heat forward  LeBron James  had 19 points, eight rebounds and six assists, while guard
 Dwyane Wade  scored a team-high 21 points.  In front of a sold-out crowd of 19,033 at Madison Square
Garden, the Knicks erased a six-point halftime deficit by
outscoring the Celtics 32-11 in the third quarter. Anthony, the
NBA’s scoring champion, contributed 13 points in the frame and
19 in the second half, amid chants of “M-V-P, M-V-P” from the
home crowd.  J.R. Smith added 19 points for the Knicks, one day after
being named the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year.  After being limited to eight points in the fourth quarter
of Game 1, Boston scored just 23 second-half points tonight.
 Paul Pierce  had a team-high 18 points.  In Miami, the Heat used a 12-0 run at the start of the
fourth quarter to pull away from Milwaukee.  Chris Bosh , Chris Andersen and  Shane Battier  each added 10 points for the Heat,
who out-rebounded the Bucks 43 to 33.  The Heat are 22-4 at home in their last nine postseason
series dating back to the 2010-11 season.  The Heat and Bucks next play in Milwaukee on April 25. The
Celtics host the Knicks in Game 3 the following evening, the
team’s first game in Boston since three people were killed and
at least 175 were injured by a pair of bombs at the Boston
Marathon on April 15.  Elsewhere tonight, the Denver Nuggets look to open a 2-0
series lead at home against the Golden State Warriors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
