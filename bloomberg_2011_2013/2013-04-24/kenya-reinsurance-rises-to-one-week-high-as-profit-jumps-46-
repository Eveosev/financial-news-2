Kenya Reinsurance Corp. (KNRE)  gained the
most in a week after saying profit rose 46 percent last year and
that it plans to expand in other African nations.  The stock advanced 1.7 percent to 17.75 shillings by the
close in Nairobi, with almost four times the three-month daily
average volume of shares traded.  Net income climbed to 2.8 billion shillings ($33 million)
from 1.92 billion, Managing Director Jadiah Mwarania told
reporters today. Investment income jumped 87 percent to 2.65
billion shillings, while gross premiums increased 20 percent to
7.94 billion shillings, he said.  “The growth in investment income was impressive,” Eva
Njuguna, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Sterling Capital
Ltd., said by phone.  The company plans to expand within  Kenya , which has East
 Africa ’s biggest economy, and open offices in southern Africa
including Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique, Mwarania
said.  “We expect our income from property to increase on plans
to put up a 1.5 billion-shilling office block in the next two
years” in Nairobi, he said.  Kenya Re has climbed 68 percent this year, outpacing the 24
percent advance on the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share
Index. (NSEASI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
