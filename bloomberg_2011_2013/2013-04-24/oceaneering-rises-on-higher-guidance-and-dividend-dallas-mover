Oceaneering International Inc. (OII) , the
world’s largest provider of underwater robots to the oilfield,
climbed to an all-time high after beating profit expectations,
raising earnings guidance for the year and boosting its
dividend.  Oceaneering rose 8 percent to $66.57 at the close in  New
York , the highest price in the company’s history.  Net income rose 45 percent to $74.8 million, or 69 cents a
share, Houston-based Oceaneering said yesterday in a statement.
That’s 8 cents better than the average of 12 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. The company raised 2013 earnings guidance
to a range of $3.10 to $3.30 per share, up from an earlier
forecast of $3 to $3.25. It also announced yesterday it will
boost its dividend to 22 cents a share from a previous quarterly
payment of 18 cents.  The quarterly results and increases in dividend and
guidance “should provide for solid outperformance on the day
and follow-through post earnings,”  Brian Uhlmer , an analyst at
Global Hunter Securities LLC in Houston, wrote today in a note
to investors he titled “triple whammy.”  Oceaneering, which has 14 buy and 10 hold  ratings  from
analysts, rose 23 percent in the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
