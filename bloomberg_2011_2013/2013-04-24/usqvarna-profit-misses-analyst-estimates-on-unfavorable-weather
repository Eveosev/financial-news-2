Husqvarna AB (HUSQB) , the world’s biggest
maker of powered garden tools, posted lower first-quarter profit
than analysts expected amid unfavorable weather, a continued
slowdown in  Europe  and a strong Swedish krona.  Net income fell 26 percent to 465 Swedish million kronor
($70 million), the company, based in the town of the same name,
said in a statement today. Analysts had expected 563 million
kronor, according to the average of 10 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We have a continued cautious outlook for demand in
Europe, while the outlook for  North America  remains more
positive,” Chief Executive Officer Hans Linnarson said in the
statement. He will step down from his post in the middle of this
year, the company has said.  The maker of robotic lawn movers, water hoses and
chainsaws, said it is on track with plans announced November to
reduce its staff to improve profitability and increase
flexibility due to the macroeconomic uncertainty in Europe.
Husqvarna supplier  Briggs & Stratton Corp. (BGG)  last week cut its
outlook for fiscal 2013 due to macroeconomic woes and
unfavorable weather conditions.  Husqvarna sales decreased to 9.02 billion kronor from 9.81
billion kronor a year earlier and compared with expectations for
9.09 billion kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
