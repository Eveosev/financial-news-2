Nigeria, Africaâ€™s largest oil
producer, will reduce exports in June of its Yoho crude to one
cargo of 950,000 barrels, two less than scheduled for May,
according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
