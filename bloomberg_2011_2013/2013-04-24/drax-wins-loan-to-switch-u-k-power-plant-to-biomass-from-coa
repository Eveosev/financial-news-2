Drax Group Plc (DRX)  got a 75 million
pound ($115 million) loan from insurer Friends Life to convert
the largest U.K. coal-fired power station to burn biomass.  The amortizing loan maturing in June 2018 is backed by the
state Infrastructure U.K. Guarantee Scheme, Selby-based Drax
said today in an e-mailed statement. The financing replaces half
of a 100 million-pound loan from the U.K. Green Investment Bank,
with funds raised for the project totaling 815 million pounds.  Drax plans to invest as much as $1 billion to turn itself
into a predominantly biomass-burning power generator, initially
switching three of its six units to burn wood pellets in the
next three to four years. RWE AG in  Germany  and Dong Energy A/S
of the  Netherlands  are also switching to burning renewable fuels
as they seek to meet European Union air-pollution standards.  The U.K. estimates bioenergy plants that use wood chips and
organic waste to produce heat and power may meet as much as 11
percent of the nationâ€™s primary energy demand in eight years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
