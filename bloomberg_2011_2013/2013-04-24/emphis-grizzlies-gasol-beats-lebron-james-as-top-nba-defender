Memphis Grizzlies center  Marc Gasol 
was named the National Basketball Association’s Defensive Player
of the Year, topping LeBron James of the Miami Heat.  Gasol received 30 first-place votes from a panel of 121
media members for 212 of a possible 1,089 points, beating three-
time league Most Valuable Player James, who garnered 149 points
and 18 first-place votes, the NBA said in a news release.  The 28-year-old Gasol is the first Grizzlies player to win
the award. At 7-foot-1 (2.16 meters), he averaged 1.7 blocks per
game and one steal per contest to lead a Grizzlies’ defense that
allowed an NBA-low 88.7 points per game during the regular
season.  The Oklahoma City Thunder’s Serge Ibaka finished third in
voting with 122 points. The Chicago Bulls’ Joakim Noah was
fourth, the Grizzlies’ Tony Allen fifth and the San Antonio
Spurs’  Tim Duncan  sixth.  Tyson Chandler, the New York Knicks’ center who last season
ended  Dwight Howard ’s three-year run winning the award, finished
13th in voting, while Howard was 14th.  To contact the reporter on this story:
