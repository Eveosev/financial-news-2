The yen may slide to 110 per dollar
in the next six months after it breaches the 100 level for the
first time in four years, according to Macquarie Bank Ltd.’s
David Forrester.  The 100 level is a technical barrier to further yen
depreciation, Forrester, senior vice-president for Group of 10
foreign-exchange strategy at Macquarie in  Singapore , said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “First Up” with  John Dawson . A decline to 110 would mark the yen’s weakest level
since August 2008.  The yen’s downward move may be exacerbated by stop-loss
orders, which are placed by investors to automatically sell
assets when declines of a specific threshold are reached,
according to Forrester. The market still needs “something
more” to push the yen past 100, he said.  “There’s a good chance that you’ll see some stop-loss runs
above 100, and it will quickly move toward a 101, 102 level,”
Forrester said. “Longer term, over the coming six months, we
could get to 110.”  Japan ’s currency rose 0.1 percent to 99.34 per dollar at
11:04 a.m. in  New York  after earlier declining as much as 0.3
percent. The yen touched 99.95 percent on April 11, its weakest
level since April 2009.  The dollar also may be driven higher versus the yen as the
 U.S. economy  strengthens and if the  Federal Reserve  cuts back on
its program of buying bonds to spur growth, according to
Forrester.  “U.S. economic data is going to improve,” Forrester said.
“We also think the Fed, by year-end, might need to be trimming
its asset purchases. There are good reasons for 110 on a
fundamental basis.”  The yen has declined 11 percent this year, the worst
performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar rose 3.6
percent and the euro climbed 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
