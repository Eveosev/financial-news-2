The Treasury’s $35 billion sale of
five-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.714 percent, according to
the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in April 2018, yielded 0.715
percent in pre-auction trading. They drew a  yield  of 0.760
percent at the last sale on March 27. The record auction low was
0.584 percent in July. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York  time.  The size of the offering is the same as at the past 31
five-year note sales after peaking at $42 billion from November
2009 through April 2010.  The March auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.73,
below the average of 2.81 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks,  bought  46.1 percent of the notes at last
month’s sale, the most since April 2012. The average for the
past 10 offerings is 40.7 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.8 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 14.7
percent at the past 10 auctions.  Five-year notes have gained 0.6 percent this year, compared
with a 0.7 percent return for Treasuries overall, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-year securities
returned 2.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall advanced
2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the second of three note sales this
week totaling $99 billion. The U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year
notes yesterday at a yield of 0.255 percent and will auction $29
billion of seven-year securities tomorrow.  The sales will raise $59.05 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $57.95 billion,
according to the  U.S. Treasury .  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
