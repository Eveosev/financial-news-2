Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the
advisory firm started by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
 Roger Altman , posted a first-quarter profit that missed analyst
estimates as the pace of global deal-making slowed.  Net income was $6 million, or 16 cents per share, compared
with a loss of $3.4 million, or 12 cents, in the year-earlier
period, New York-based Evercore said in a statement today.
Adjusted earnings, which exclude some items, were $16.8 million,
or 37 cents a share, missing the 45-cent  average estimate  of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Global announced deal volume declined 1.6 percent to $475
billion in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That followed a full year in which
merger-and-acquisition dollar volume fell for the first time
since 2009, the data show. Evercore Chief Executive Officer
Ralph Schlosstein, 62, has said he’s seeing an improvement in
conditions that could lead to a pickup in M&A activity.  “Evercore continues to grow in 2013, despite a murky
market environment, and our backlog remains strong” Altman said
today in the statement.  The stock climbed 1.7 percent to close yesterday at $36.87
in  New York . The shares have gained 22 percent this year, twice
the 11 percent advance of the 478-company  Russell 2000 Financial
Services Index. (RGUSFS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
