EMC Corp. (EMC) , the world’s biggest
maker of storage computers, plans to buy back $1 billion in
shares this year after reporting first-quarter earnings that
missed analysts’ estimates as customers restrained spending.  Net income fell 1.2 percent to $580.1 million, or 26 cents
a share, from $586.8 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier, the
Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding some costs, profit was 39 cents a share,
missing the 40-cent average of analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 5.8 percent to $5.39 billion, compared
with the $5.42 billion average analyst projection.  EMC customers are trimming storage-computer purchases amid
an uncertain economic outlook.  International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  last week reported first-quarter profit that missed
analysts estimates, hurt by a hardware slump. It cited the poor
performance of some businesses, such as certain storage
products. Sales growth at EMC’s  VMWare (VMW)  Inc. subsidiary has been
under pressure as U.S. companies and federal agencies are
reducing technology budgets.  Sales for 2013 will probably be $23.5 billion, the company
reiterated today.  EMC rose less than 1 percent to $22.53 at 11:40 a.m. in New
York. The shares had declined 12 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with an 11 percent gain for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  VMware, the software maker that’s majority-owned by EMC,
yesterday forecast second-quarter sales that fell short of
analysts’ projections as business customers trim spending. The
shares dropped 6 percent in extended trading.  EMC Chief Financial Officer David Goulden said in March
that the company will boost revenue by at least 8 percent a year
and profit excluding certain costs will rise 10 percent annually
through 2016 as it increases market share. Sales will exceed $30
billion in 2016, Goulden said at an analyst meeting in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
