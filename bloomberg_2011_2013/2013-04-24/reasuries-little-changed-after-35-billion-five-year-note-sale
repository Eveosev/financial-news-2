Treasury 10-year note yields
approached the lowest level of the year after a government
report showed orders for U.S. durable goods fell in March by the
most in seven months, boosting demand for the safest assets.  The U.S. sold $35 billion in five-year securities at a
yield of 0.71 percent, the lowest at an auction since November,
while demand was the highest in three months. The U.S. Commerce
Department  reported bookings  for goods meant to last at least
three years fell  5.7 percent  in March, exceeding the median
forecast for a 3 percent drop, according to a Bloomberg survey
of 78 economists.  “The economic data has been weakening steadily in recent
weeks,” said  William O’Donnell , head U.S. government-bond
strategist at  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ’s RBS Securities
unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , one of 21 primary dealers that
are obligated to bid at the auctions. “People are starting to
get worried about growth,” which “could keep the money flowing
into safe-haven assets like fives today,” O’Donnell said.  The benchmark 10-year note  yield  less than one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.70 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2
percent note due February 2023 was 102 21/32. The yield dropped
to 1.64 percent yesterday, the lowest since Dec. 12.  Current five-year  note yields  fell one basis point to 0.69
percent.  Volatility Drops  Treasury volatility as measured by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s  MOVE index  fell to a record 50.04 basis points
yesterday, below the low of 50.58 basis points reached April 22.
The previous low had been 51 basis points in December. The data
stretch back to 1988.  The five-year note auction  yield  compared with a forecast
of 0.714 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of the
Fed’s primary dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of notes offered,
was 2.86, the highest since January, versus an average of 2.81
at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks,  bought  43.6 percent of the five-year
notes today, compared with 46.1 percent at the March sale, the
most since April 2012. The average for the past 10 sales is 40.7
percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14 percent at
today’s sale, the lowest since September and compared with 16.8
percent at last month’s auction of the securities. The average
at the past 10 auctions is 14.7 percent.  ‘Safety’ Play  “There’s still a lot of uncertainty out there -- there’s a
lot of money that wants the safety of U.S. Treasuries,” said
Thomas Roth, senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi
UFJ Securities USA Inc.  Five-year notes have climbed 0.6 percent this year,
compared with a 0.7 percent return by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-
year securities returned 2.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall advanced 2.2 percent.  The U.S. is scheduled to auction $29 billion of seven-year
debt tomorrow, the last of three note sales this week totaling
$99 billion.  The sales this week will raise $59.05 billion of new cash,
as maturing securities held by the public total $57.95 billion,
according to the  U.S. Treasury .  Fed Buying  Demand rose for the first time since January at yesterday’s
$35 billion two-year offering. The  bid-to-cover  ratio was 3.63
after 3.27 at the last sale and averaged 3.72 at the past 10
sales. The notes were sold at a so-called  high yield  of 0.233
percent, just above the record-low auction level of 0.22 percent
at the July sale.  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$702 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $2.98 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, data released by the Treasury and compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage
bonds a month to boost the economy by putting downward pressure
on borrowing costs, including $1.575 billion of the securities
maturing between February 2036 and August 2042 today. Dealers
submitted offers for $4.267 billion of the debt.  A Bloomberg News survey published April 22 showed the
primary dealers who are required to bid at government-debt
auctions expect the central bank will continue the present pace
of purchases into at least the fourth quarter of this year.  The central bank has held its benchmark  interest rate  at
zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to support the economy. It
reiterated on March 20 that the rate will remain low as long as
unemployment, now at 7.7 percent, stays above 6.5 percent and
inflation is projected at no more than 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
