Heathrow Airport Ltd.  said the
number of passengers flying through  Europe ’s busiest aviation
hub rose to a first-quarter record as airlines added larger
aircraft.  Passenger traffic gained 1.8 percent to 16 million people
in the three months ended March 31, the London-based company
said in a statement today. Load factor, a measure of occupancy,
grew by 2.4 percentage points to 71.9 percent, while the average
number of seats per plane jumped to 199.9 from 195.5.  “What we are seeing over recent months are bigger and
fuller aircraft,”  Jose Leo , Heathrow’s chief financial officer,
said in an interview. “Fuller aircraft means the airlines are
managing their operations more efficiently and load factors are
growing very significantly,” he said. “The average number of
seats per aircraft is going up.”  Heathrow is seeking regulatory approval for a 3 billion-
pound ($4.58 billion) spending plan, which will go into effect
April 2014 and fund new taxiways and baggage systems. The
investment will bring the total amount spent on the hub since
2003 to 14 billion pounds and drive a 41 percent increase in the
average charge per passenger by 2019. Britain’s  Civil Aviation
Authority  is “days away” from releasing its price cap
proposals, Leo said.  Aeronautical income rose 11.9 percent to 301 million pounds
and the average charge per passenger for the quarter was 18.87
pounds, Heathrow said today. Retail income was up 2.9 percent,
while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization jumped to 244 million pounds from 221 million a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
