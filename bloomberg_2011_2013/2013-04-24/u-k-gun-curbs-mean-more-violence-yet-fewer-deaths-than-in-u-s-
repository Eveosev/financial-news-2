The U.K.’s strict gun controls mean
it has a lower homicide rate than the U.S. even though there’s
more violent crime, according to  a study  that also found
violence in Britain fell over the past decade.  According to the Sydney-based Institute for Economics and
Peace, the U.K. had 933 violent crimes per 100,000 people in
2012, down from 1,255 in 2003. In the U.S., the figure for 2010
was 399 violent crimes per 100,000 people. Still, while the U.S.
violent-crime rate is less than half Britain’s, its homicide
rate between 2003 and 2011 was almost four times as high.  A series of mass shootings, including the December murder
of 20 children and six adults in Newtown,  Connecticut , have
revived questions about  gun control  in the U.S. In the U.K.,
where all guns require licenses and are hard to obtain legally,
they’re used in 1 in 13 homicides. In the U.S., they’re used in
two out of three.  “You’ve got 10 times the likelihood of being killed in
violent crime in the U.S. than you have in the U.K.,” Steve
Killelea, the founder of the institute, told the BBC today.
“The strict gun controls in the U.K. are one of the reasons
you’ve got such good homicide rates.”  According to the institute, if the U.S. homicide rate were
the same as the U.K.’s, it would prevent 12,000 deaths a year.  The study found that violence costs the U.K. 124 billion
pounds ($189 billion) a year, more than 7 percent of gross
domestic product. The level of violence has fallen 11 percent
over the past decade, one of the sharpest declines in western
 Europe , the institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
