Gasoline futures fluctuated as
orders for U.S. durable goods fell in March, indicating lower
fuel demand, while an industry group reported inventories of the
motor fuel sank last week. Crack spreads narrowed.  Prices swung between a 0.4 percent drop and a 1 percent
gain. Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
slipped the most in seven months in March. The  American
Petroleum Institute  estimated gasoline stocks declined 2.7
million barrels the week ending April 19. The fuel’s  crack
spread  versus June WTI shrank 60 cents to $24.32 a barrel, and
the  spread  versus Brent tightened 31 cents to $13.48.  “Economic reports have been mixed-to-poor lately, and
that’s one of the reasons we’ve seen such a sharp sell-off,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We’ve chased off the longs who
bought in. We have the whole driving season in front of us.
We’re seeing the market stabilizing and prices start to firm.”  Gasoline for May delivery fell 0.39 cent to $2.7151 a
gallon at 9:36 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange on
volume that was 46 percent above the 100-day average for the
time of day.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.1 cent to
$3.515 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.  EIA Report  The Energy Information Administration will probably report
at 10:30 a.m. that stockpiles fell by 600,000 barrels to 221.1
million, according to the median of 11 analyst surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Distillate stockpiles increased by 666,000 barrels, the API
said. The Bloomberg survey forecast that inventories of
 distillate fuel , which includes heating oil and diesel, rose
500,000 barrels to 115.7 million.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery rose 0.39 cent to
$2.8202 a gallon on the Nymex. Trading volume was 39 percent
