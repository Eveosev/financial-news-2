Strong Petroleum Pte Ltd., a
Singapore-based oil-trading company, hired Oystein Berentsen
from Norway’s  Statoil ASA (STL)  to be managing director for crude.  Berentsen will start May 6, Francis Tan, general manager of
Strong Petroleum in Singapore, said in an e-mail today. The
company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed  Strong
Petrochemical Holdings Ltd. (852)   Berentsen, 60, worked for 32 years at Statoil, most
recently as president of crude trading in Singapore from 2005 to
2012, he said in an e-mail yesterday. A Statoil spokesman didn’t
respond to an e-mail and text message seeking comment and didn’t
answer three phone calls made during business hours in Norway.  To contact the reporter on this story:
