  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-
largest U.S. wireless carrier, reported a narrower-than-expected
first-quarter loss, even as 560,000 subscribers departed.  The first-quarter loss was 21 cents a share,  Overland Park ,
Kansas-based Sprint said today in a statement. Analysts had
predicted a loss of 34 cents on average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose less than 1 percent from a
year earlier to $8.79 billion, compared with an average  estimate 
of $8.74 billion.  Sprint, which is spending to build a faster long-term
evolution network to retain more customers, sold 5 million
smartphones, including 1.5 million of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone.
Though smartphone sales hurt profit in the short term because
carriers subsidize them, the devices encourage subscribers to
use more data, helping increase revenue in the long run.  “While Ebitda beat is nice to see, the contributing factor
was the lower gross adds,” said  Jennifer Fritzsche , an analyst
at Wells Fargo & Co. in Chicago, in a research note. Ebitda is a
measure of profit. “Sprint is trying to get its LTE ramped up
before being aggressive with its marketing and focusing on share
gain,” she said.  Sprint fell less than 1 percent to $7.09 at the close in
New York. The shares have almost tripled in the past 12 months
as the company found itself the target of a bidding war. Tokyo-
based  SoftBank Corp. (9984) ’s agreement to pay $20 billion for a 70
percent stake was followed earlier this month by a $25.5 billion
proposal from  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  Both deals aim to build Sprint
into a bigger challenger to  Verizon Wireless  and  AT&T Inc. (T)   Improved Forecast  The company  forecast  2013 operating profit to be at the
high end of its previously stated range of $5.2 billion to $5.5
billion, before depreciation and amortization and excluding the
closing of transactions.  The 560,000 contract customer defections compared with an
expectation of 512,000, based on the average of eight analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sprint’s first-quarter average phone bill for contract
customers was $62.47, up from $61.47 in the fourth quarter.
Analysts were expecting $62.54, according to the average of
seven estimates.  Of the first-quarter iPhone customers, Sprint said 43
percent were new to the carrier, compared with 38 percent last
quarter.  The operating profit margin of the wireless business,
excluding costs such as depreciation and amortization, was 19.2
percent in the first quarter, up from 14.6 percent a  year 
earlier. Analysts had estimated a margin of 14.7 percent.  Sprint’s first-quarter net loss narrowed to $643 million,
or 21 cents a share, from $863 million, or 29 cents, a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
