Azeri Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov said he was “pleased” to see his mostly Shiite
Muslim nation on  Iran ’s northern border cementing ties with
 Israel  as he completed a three-day visit to the Jewish state.  Mammadyarov, Azerbaijan’s first foreign minister to visit
Israel, met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Shimon Peres and other Israeli officials during his April 21-23 trip,
saying the visit will help expand ties further, his office said
today by e-mail.  The visit marks a turning point in Azerbaijan’s relations
with Israel after the former Soviet republic has in the past
refrained from high-level visits under Iranian pressure.
Azerbaijan, which shares a 756-kilometer (470-mile) border with
the Islamic republic, has faced criticism from its neighbor for
forging closer ties with Israel and Western nations and allowing
the entry of companies like  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  in energy projects on the Caspian Sea.  Israel buys oil from Azerbaijan, the third-largest crude
producer in the former Soviet Union, and sells advanced weapons
including drones and missile systems to the Caspian Sea nation
locked in a territorial dispute with neighboring Armenia.  Mammadyarov and Israeli leaders exchanged views “on the
developments in the Middle East region” and talked about issues
of mutual interest, the Azeri Foreign Ministry said, without
elaborating.  Peres described Mammadyarov’s visit as a “historic” one,
according to the  Jerusalem Post . He said Azerbaijan takes a
clear stand against war and accused Iran of funding terrorism
and developing nuclear weapons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
