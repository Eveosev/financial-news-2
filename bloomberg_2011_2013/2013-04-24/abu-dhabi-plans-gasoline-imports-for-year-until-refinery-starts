Abu Dhabi will continue importing
gasoline for at least a year to meet domestic demand until a new
refinery begins producing the fuel 12 months from now, officials
with the state oil company said.  “We’re balanced on most products, except for gasoline,”
said Sultan Al Mehairi, marketing and refining director at Abu
Dhabi National Oil Co. “That’s the focus of our new refinery.”  Persian Gulf crude exporters, including Saudi Arabia,  Iraq 
and the United Arab Emirates, buy refined fuels like gasoline
and diesel to meet local demand when they don’t have sufficient
capacity themselves. The countries are expanding refinery
operations to satisfy that demand and cut imports.  Adnoc, as the oil producer in the largest U.A.E. sheikhdom
is known, will continue importing about six to eight cargoes
each quarter until the refinery reaches full capacity, Al
Mehairi said at a conference in Abu Dhabi yesterday.  The company is doubling capacity at the 400,000 barrel-a-
day Ruwais facility, its largest, and expects to bring the unit
online by March, Ahmed Abdulla, chief operating officer at
Adnoc’s refinining arm, said. Al Mehairi and Abdulla both spoke
at the Middle East Petroleum and Gas Conference.  Gasoline production from the new units will start in April
or May next year and will double output to 5.3 million metric
tons a year, Abdulla said. The new plant will include a 127,100
barrel-a-day residue fluid catalytic cracker, a plant that makes
the transport fuel and chemical products, he said. Ruwais is set
to reach full capacity by August 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
