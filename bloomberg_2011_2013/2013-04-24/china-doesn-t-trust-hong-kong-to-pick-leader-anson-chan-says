Anson Chan, the former chief
secretary of Hong Kong, said  China  doesn’t trust residents in
the former British colony to vote for a chief executive that
will back Beijing’s rule.  Chan said yesterday she has formed a group called “Hong
Kong 2020” that will reach out to Beijing and different
communities for proposals on constitutional reforms needed for
the 2017 introduction of universal suffrage in the city.  “It seems to us their basic concern is that they do not
trust the people of Hong Kong to use the vote in their hands
wisely,” Chan said at a press conference. “That given a vote
tomorrow, Hong Kong people will vote somebody who will oppose
the central government.”  Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, the last
selected leader for the city, is facing pressure from lawmakers
to speed up reforms needed, with a civic group threatening a
mass protest next July if no progress is made. A Chinese
official said last month China won’t allow Hong Kong to choose a
chief executive who opposes Beijing’s rule.  Leung, the third leader of Hong Kong since the 1997
handover, was picked by a committee of billionaires,
professionals and lawmakers in 2012. Chan said yesterday her
group is “particularly anxious to establish a dialog with” the
business sector.  Qiao Xiaoyang, chairman of the law committee of the
National People’s Congress, said on March 24 that consultations
about political reform in Hong Kong shouldn’t start until
everybody agrees that the leader of the city “can’t plot to
overthrow the rule of the Chinese Communist Party.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
