U.S. stock-index futures erased
gains after government data showed orders for durable goods fell
more than forecast last month, damping optimism in the economy.  Futures on the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index expiring in June
were down less than 0.1 percent at 1,573.5 at 8:32 a.m. in  New
York  after rising as much as 0.4 percent earlier.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
decreased 5.7 percent after a revised 4.3 percent gain the prior
month that was smaller than previously estimated, the Commerce
Department reported today in  Washington . The median forecast of
78 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 3 percent
decline. Orders excluding transportation equipment, which is
volatile month to month, unexpectedly fell for a second month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
