American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer that repaid a U.S. bailout last year, posted its
best two-day gain since June in New York trading on speculation
the company may resume dividend payments.  AIG climbed 98 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $41.60 at 4 p.m.
The New York-based insurer has rallied 7.7 percent in the past
two days.  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life insurer, raised its
 quarterly payout  yesterday for the first time since 2007, after
the company limited Federal Reserve capital oversight by selling
its banking assets. AIG stopped paying a dividend in 2008, the
year it took a U.S. government rescue as mortgage-related losses
drained capital.  “We expect a small dividend could be reinstated in 2013”
by AIG,  Jay Gelb , an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a note to
investors yesterday after MetLife’s announcement.  AIG Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  has been
paying down debt to cut interest expenses as he works to improve
the company’s credit rating.  “As the year progresses, we will then begin to look at
things like ‘Could we add a dividend to the stock and also could
we have some kind of modest stock buyback?’” Benmosche said in a
Feb. 22 conference call. “But we’re going to wait until we’re
very, very sure we’re in great shape.”  MetLife climbed 1.5 percent to $38.32 after surging 5.5
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
