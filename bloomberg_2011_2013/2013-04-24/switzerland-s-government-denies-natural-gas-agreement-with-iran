Switzerland ’s government denied the
nation agreed to import natural gas from  Iran .  Iran’s state-owned Press TV website said on April 19th that
the country finalized an  export deal , citing Javad Owji, deputy
oil minister and head of the National Iranian Gas Co. The
reports are “nonsense,” Conradin Rasi, a spokesman for the
Swiss Federal Office of Energy, said today by telephone.  Swiss gas trader EGL AG had negotiated to buy Iranian gas
until talks were put on hold in 2010 as the  United Nations  and
European Union stepped up sanctions on Iran over its nuclear
program, Rasi said. EGL has since changed its name to Axpo
Trading and has no plans to procure gas from Iran, said Daniela
Biedermann, a spokeswoman for parent company Axpo Holding AG.  “The Iranians are behaving as if there are no sanctions,”
Rasi said. “It’s clear to everyone that it’s impossible to
implement this agreement as long as international sanctions
continue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
