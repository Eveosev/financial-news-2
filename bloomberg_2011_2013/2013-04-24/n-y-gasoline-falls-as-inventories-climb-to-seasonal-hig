New York  Harbor gasoline weakened
versus futures after East Coast inventories advanced to a 14-
year  seasonal high  and refineries processed more crude.  Regional stockpiles of the motor fuel increased 570,000
barrels to  60.6 million barrels  a day in the week ended April
19, the highest level for the time of year since 1999, according
to Energy Information Administration data compiled by Bloomberg.
East Coast refineries processed 1.15 million barrels of  crude
and other feedstock , up from 1.12 million last week.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, in New York
Harbor slid 0.75 cent to a discount of  13.25 cents  a gallon
under New York Mercantile Exchange futures at 1:50 p.m.
Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline,  or RBOB , was unchanged at a
discount of 2.25 cents a gallon.  Gasoline supplies on the U.S. East Coast have climbed 4.8
percent this month as plants including Philadelphia Energy
Solutions’  Philadelphia refinery  returned from planned
maintenance. The increase may also have been aided by area
imports of the fuel, which the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm, reported at  592,000 barrels  this week, a 2
percent increase.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York Harbor, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on Brent oil
in  Europe , dropped 22 cents to $14.61 a barrel, a second
consecutive decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
