Nordea Bank AB (NDA) , the Nordic region’s
largest lender, said profit rose 2.7 percent in the first
quarter after reporting smaller impairments at its Danish
division and shipping unit.  Net income increased to 794 million euros ($1.03 billion)
from 773 million euros a year earlier, the Stockholm-based
lender said in a statement today. That beat the average 745.2
million-euro  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net
loan losses fell 8.7 percent to 199 million euros. The results
helped the bank raise its core Tier 1 capital ratio to 13.2
percent, under Basel II rules.  “Our  credit quality  is robust and loan losses declined by
18 percent in the quarter,” Chief Executive Officer  Christian Clausen  said in the statement. “In Denmark and shipping, the
trend is stabilizing and we continue to expect an improvement
during 2013 compared to 2012. Our 10-year historic average has
been 16 basis points and we expect to approach that level in the
coming years.”  Clausen is cutting about 10 percent of Nordea’s workforce
to help meet stricter regulatory rules. The pan-Nordic bank,
which is lagging behind Swedish rivals  Svenska Handelsbanken AB (SHBA) 
and  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  in terms of capital ratios, said today its core
Tier 1 capital ratio rose from 13.1 percent at the end of last
year.  Nordea said Jan. 30 it targets a core Tier 1 capital ratio
above 13 percent and a return on equity of 15 percent, under
normal interest rate conditions, by no later than Jan. 1, 2015.
The bank needs to meet higher capital standards in  Sweden  than
those set elsewhere as the government of Prime Minister Fredrik
Reinfeldt pledges to protect taxpayers from bank-industry
losses. Sweden’s four biggest banks must hold at least 12
percent core Tier 1 capital against their risk-weighted assets
by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
