Barclays Plc (BARC) , the first U.K. bank to report first-quarter results, posted a bigger-than-estimated gain in investment banking profit and said it’s on track to meet its target for cost cuts. The shares advanced.  Pretax profit at the securities unit, which accounts for more than half of the bank’s earnings, rose 11 percent to 1.32 billion pounds ($2 billion), the London-based lender said in a statement today. That beat the 1.25 billion-pound median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins  told reporters today the lender made a “strong start” to its cost-reduction plan and is on target to cut 1.7 billion pounds of expenses by 2015.  The bank is stripping out layers of management and shrinking its money-losing operations in  Europe  to meet the objective. It’s also bolstering its investment-banking unit by focusing on the U.S., where rising income from arranging takeovers and stock offerings is helping to cushion a drop in Europe. Equities revenue jumped 19 percent in the quarter, the lender said today.  “The Barclays thesis can’t work unless the returns on the investment bank work, and we like the clear strategy,” said Chirantan Barua, an analyst at Bernstein Research in  London  who rates the stock an outperform. “While Europe has been a bug bear so far, it’s refreshing to see management being aggressive around downsizing the business.”  The  stock  rose as much as 5.9 percent and was up 1.6 percent at 303.05 pence as of 9:57 a.m. in London trading, for a market value of about 37.8 billion pounds. The shares have gained 12 percent so far this year, making Barclays the best performer among Britain’s five biggest banks.  ‘Good Start’  “The good start to the year has continued into the second quarter across our businesses,” Barclays Chief Financial Officer Chris Lucas told reporters on a conference call today.  Impairments fell 10 percent to 706 million pounds, beating analyst estimates. The lender had net income of 839 million pounds compared with a net loss of 598 million pounds in the year-earlier period.  Barclays’s pretax profit excluding losses on the valuation of the lender’s debt fell 25 percent to 1.79 billion pounds from 2.4 billion pounds in the year-earlier period. That missed the 2.1 billion-pound estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Barclays has reviewed 75 of its units to weed out those that pose a reputational risk or don’t make profits under the Transform program. It will cut 3,800 jobs as part of the overhaul, which will cost about 1 billion pounds in 2013.  European Unit  The lender booked a 514 million-pound charge for restructuring costs after closing branches in Europe and cutting investment banking positions in the region and in  Asia .  The European  retail and business bank  posted a 462 million- pound loss in the quarter, compared with a 72 million-pound loss in the year-earlier period. The unit logged 356 million pounds of restructuring charges while sales of mortgages and investment products declined. The securities unit booked 116 million pounds of charges linked to Jenkins’ so-called Transform plan.  Revenue at the fixed income, currency and commodities business, the investment bank’s largest, fell 6 percent as gains linked to last year’s decision by the  European Central Bank  to offer firms unlimited three-year loans weren’t repeated.  That was in line with a 7 percent decline at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and a 5 percent decline at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barua said in a report to clients. Credit Suisse Group AG,  Switzerland ’s second-largest bank, today posted a 3.1 percent increase in revenue from fixed-income sales and trading in the first quarter.  Equities Income  Income at the equities operation rose 19 percent to 706 million pounds while investment-banking revenue, which includes mergers advisory, advanced 8 percent to 558 million pounds on rising fees from  equity capital markets .  Rich Ricci , who oversees the investment bank, will step down in June. The 49-year-old will be replaced by Eric Bommensath and Tom King as co-CEOs of corporate and investment banking in May. Peter Horrell, who joined the bank in 1990, will become interim head of the wealth unit, replacing Tom Kalaris.
