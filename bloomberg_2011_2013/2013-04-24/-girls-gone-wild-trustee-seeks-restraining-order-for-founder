The trustee running the company
behind the “Girls Gone Wild” videos asked a federal judge to
ban the founder of the soft-core porn series from the company’s
offices, saying he’s a violent man who threatened workers.  Joe Francis, who started the video series, threatened
employees of GGW Brands LLC with “violent acts,” according to
court papers filed by bankruptcy trustee R. Todd Neilson. GGW
filed bankruptcy in February after being sued by Steve Wynn’s
Wynn Las Vegas LLC and others trying to collect debts allegedly
owed by Francis.  Francis claims he doesn’t own or control GGW, although he
has an office in the company’s Los Angeles’ headquarters,
Neilson said in court papers. Francis founded GGW and is trying
to maintain control despite a court order appointing a trustee,
Neilson said in a complaint filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Los Angeles.  Days after a federal judge installed Neilson, Francis
“made violent threats to the debtors’ employees and attempted
to fire them based on his belief that they were not being
sufficiently obsequious to him and were not obeying his
commands,” according to the filing.  GGW Brands listed debt of $16.3 million and assets of less
than $50,000 when it filed its bankruptcy petition. Most of the
debt is related to multimillion dollar from court judgments
against Francis.  Francis didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the trustee’s allegations.  The case is In re GGW Brands, LLC 13-15130, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles)  To contact the reporter on this story:
