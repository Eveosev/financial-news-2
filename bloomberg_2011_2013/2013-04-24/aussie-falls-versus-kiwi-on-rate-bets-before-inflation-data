Australia ’s dollar fell toward the
lowest in three years versus its New Zealand counterpart as
traders bet the interest-rate gap between the two nations will
narrow.  The so-called Aussie held a three-day loss against the
greenback on speculation consumer price index data today will
give the  Reserve Bank  of Australia scope to cut  interest rates .
New Zealand’s kiwi dollar rose against all its most-traded
counterparts after the central bank left borrowing costs
unchanged and said it’s concerned about house-price gains. New
Zealand’s 10-year government bond  yield  fell to a record.  “There’s not a currency pair out there that works more on
rate differentials than Aussie-kiwi, and rate expectations are
going to be the key driver going forward,” said  Chris Weston ,
the chief market strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne. “If we
see a really weak print for CPI, I would probably expect Aussie-
kiwi to drop down to NZ$1.21 or NZ$1.20.”  The Aussie fell 0.3 percent to NZ$1.2180 as of 10:30 a.m.
in Sydney after earlier touching NZ$1.2137, the lowest since
July 16, 2010. It was at $1.0265 from $1.0258.  The kiwi gained 0.3 percent to 84.27 U.S. cents. The yield
on the 10-year government bond dropped to a record 3.21 percent.  Australian consumer price  inflation  probably rose 0.7
percent in the first three months of this year from the prior
quarter, when it climbed 0.2 percent, according to the median of
24 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “The risk 1is a low-side surprise which would see the
market  ramp up expectations for a cut at the RBA’s May
meeting,” analysts at National Australia Bank Ltd., headed by
 Peter Jolly , global head of research, wrote in a note today.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 38 percent chance the Reserve Bank will cut the benchmark
rate in May.  New Zealand’s central bank said economic growth has
accelerated and it’s concerned about rising home prices after
keeping  borrowing costs  at a record-low 2.5 percent today. The
rate decision was  forecast  by all 15 economists in a separate
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
