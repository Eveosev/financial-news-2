Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) , the
largest U.S. iron-ore producer, rose the most in four years
after first-quarter earnings topped analysts’ estimates as it
idled some mines to reduce operating costs.  Cliffs  climbed  16 percent to $21.13 at 10:14 a.m. in  New
York  after earlier increasing as much as 17 percent, the most
intraday since March 23, 2009. The jump makes Cliffs the day’s
best performer on the Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  after  Akamai
Technologies Inc. (AKAM)   Net income fell to $107 million, or 66 cents a share, from
$375.8 million, or $2.63, a year earlier, the Cleveland-based
company said in a statement after the close of regular trading
on U.S. markets yesterday. Excluding a 6-cent tax benefit, per-
share profit exceeded the 33-cent average of 18  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 5.9 percent to $1.14 billion.  In the past six months Cliffs has idled some production at
mines in Michigan and Minnesota, cut its dividend by 76 percent
and sold equity and depositary shares to raise $995 million
after the price of  iron ore  slumped. The company also announced
in November it would postpone the expansion of its Bloom Lake
mine in Canada.  “When the wind changed, these guys adjusted the sails,”
Laurence Balter, an analyst at Oracle Investment Research in Fox
Island,  Washington , said in a phone interview yesterday. “The
cost decreased and average iron-ore prices increased. That’s
exactly what you want.”  Costs Drop  Cliffs’ cost of goods sold and operating expenses in its
U.S. iron-ore division fell 8 percent to $252.8 million while
its cash cost per ton at U.S. mines dropped by 1.6 percent. Per-
ton cost at its Eastern Canadian division dropped 4.4 percent to
$99.41 a ton, the company said in the statement.  The company raised its U.S. iron-ore sales outlook to 21
million tons from a previous estimate of 20 million tons as it
sees blast furnace steel output in the U.S. and  Canada  of 40
million to 45 million tons at $630 a ton, down from an earlier
estimate of $650.  Cliffs’ first-quarter coal sales volume rose 27 percent to
1.79 million tons after the Oak Grove mine recovered from 2011
storm damage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
