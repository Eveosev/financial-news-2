Slovakia plans to narrow its budget
 deficit  to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2014 from a
projected 3 percent of GDP this year as economic growth revives,
the  Finance Ministry  said.  The deficit goals for 2015 and 2016 are 2 percent and 1.3
percent of GDP respectively as the country seeks to meet the
European Union requirement for a continuing improvement of
public finances, the ministry said in a  document  posted on the
governmentâ€™s website. The deficit goals throughout 2016 ensure
that public debt will stay below 57 percent of GDP.  Slovakia, the eastern European country that adopted the
euro in 2009, is striving to narrow its  budget deficit  at a time
when its export-oriented economy is hurt by the lingering crisis
in the common-currency bloc. Prime Minister  Robert Fico  has said
that prudent fiscal policy is his priority as he seeks to
differentiate Slovakia from troubled euro members.  The 2014 fiscal target is based on a forecast of economic
growth accelerating to 2.9 percent from 1.2 percent estimated
for this year. In addition to export demand, growth will also be
driven by household spending, which is set to recover from 2014
after unemployment falls from the peak.  The government is by law obliged to approve a so-called
2014 budget framework, which sets the deficit target, by August.
A detailed spending plan must be submitted to parliament in
October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
