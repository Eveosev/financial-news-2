Denmark ’s government agreed with
the opposition on additional investments to boost the Nordic
economy as it struggles to overcome a housing slump.  The government reached an accord on the second part of a 75
billion-krone ($13 billion) plan through 2020 to create jobs and
strengthen businesses, the Copenhagen-based  Finance Ministry 
said today in a statement.  The deal includes 15 billion kroner in additional
investments and lower corporate taxes, the ministry said. The
Social Democrat-led ruling coalition and the opposition earlier
this week agreed on a 17 billion-krone package of measures
including  tax deductions  on home refurbishments and reduced
levies on soft drinks and beer designed to curb border trade.  Gross domestic product shrank 0.7 percent in the fourth
quarter from the third as Denmark’s economy suffered its worst
year since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009.
The nation has yet to emerge from a housing crisis that has sent
property values down more than 20 percent since 2007 and wiped
out more than a dozen regional banks. GDP will grow 0.5 percent  To contact the reporter on this story:
