China  must allow foreign companies
to invest more in sectors including telecommunications and
health-care to avoid a slowdown in growth as wages rise, a U.S.
business group said.  Improving the foreign-investment climate and removing the
monopoly status of state-owned companies will boost productivity
and economic growth, the American Chamber of Commerce in China
said in a report today. Doing so will help China escape the
stagnant growth that has befallen other rapidly industrializing
countries, the group said.  “Productivity in the Chinese economy must increase and
improve if China is going to develop beyond middle income
status,” Amcham China President Chris Murck said at a briefing.
“Many multinational companies in the U.S. and  Europe  and  Japan 
and other places have been focused for a long time on how to
increase productivity and how to manage costs.”  More foreign investment should be allowed in banking,
health-care and telecommunications, according to the report.  Murck said that air pollution in China is “a truly
negative factor” that has led some companies to bring back
hardship premiums for their expatriate staff in Beijing.  In an annual survey released last month, the Chamber said
U.S. companies operating in China believe rising labor costs are
the biggest risk to their business in the country.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
