Mexican  consumer prices  fell in
early April for the first time since late November as
electricity subsidies kicked in, bolstering analysts’ calls for
 interest rates  to remain on hold.  Prices slid 0.09 percent in the first two weeks of this
month from the previous two weeks, compared with the 0.10
percent median decline of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg survey,
the national statistics agency said today on its  website . Annual
inflation  quickened  to 4.72 percent, the fastest since the
second half of September, remaining above the central bank’s
target range. Core prices, which exclude energy and farm costs,
rose 0.05 percent, compared with an increase of 0.06 percent
forecast by 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on inflation-linked bonds maturing December 2013
rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.70
percent, the highest since Apr. 2012, at 9:10 a.m. in Mexico
City, as traders forecast inflation will ease. The peso fell 0.3
percent to 12.2818 per dollar today and has strengthened 4.7
percent this year, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  The central bank cut its benchmark rate by half a point to
a record 4 percent on March 8 as expansion  Latin America ’s
biggest economy after  Brazil  is slowing. At the same time,
inflation quickened to above its 2 percent to 4 percent target
range. The  International Monetary Fund  this month joined
analysts in lowering its growth forecast for Mexico as expansion
eased in the U.S., the nation’s biggest trading partner, and
after some economic indicators in the first quarter were worse
than economists expected.  The IMF  forecasts  Mexico’s economy will expand 3.4 percent
this year, slower than 2012’s 3.9 percent and less than the
previous estimate of 3.5 percent in January. Economists reduced
their growth forecast to 3.2 percent from 3.4 percent in a bi-
weekly survey by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit released April
22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
