TV Azteca SAB (AZTECACP) ,  Mexico ’s second-
largest broadcaster, dropped the most in more than a year after
government delays in advertising spending cut into profits.  Azteca  slid  6.3 percent to 9.23 pesos at the close in
Mexico City, the biggest one-day drop since August 2011. The
shares have climbed 8.8 percent this year, compared to a 3.2
percent decline for the benchmark IPC index.  The broadcaster and its larger rival,  Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) ,
count on commercials purchased by government agencies to promote
their initiatives. Televisa said in February that some
government agencies didn’t participate in its annual advance
sales of advertising because they were busy with the transition
to a new presidential administration.  “The sales decline is explained by the lower revenue from
advertising, principally from government since it’s in the
middle of redefining its communications projects,” Andres Audiffred, an analyst at Grupo Financiero Ve Por Mas SA, said
today in an e-mailed report.  First-quarter net income fell to 151.6 million pesos ($12.3
million) from 437.7 million pesos a year earlier, Azteca said
yesterday after the close of trading. Sales decreased 12 percent
to 2.42 billion pesos, missing Audiffred’s estimate of 2.83
billion pesos.  Azteca, based in Mexico City, said yesterday that it
expected government projects would recover later this year.  Televisa, which is scheduled to report first-quarter
results tomorrow,  dropped  1.1 percent to 63.09 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
