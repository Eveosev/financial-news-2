John Laing Plc, a U.K. developer of
hospitals, schools and roads, estimates it will spend about 50
million pounds ($76 million) this year on onshore wind and
photovoltaic power projects in Britain and  Sweden .  The company plans to invest in five developments this year,
using debt to fund 50 percent to 70 percent of each plant, Ross
McArthur, head of renewable energy for London-based John Laing,
said in an interview. It wants to invest in areas with different
regulatory structures to reduce reliance on one kind, he said.  The company completed three wind and two solar deals last
year. While itâ€™s currently focused on northern European markets
including the U.K., John Laing is able to access the Australian
and North American markets through locally based teams, said
Andy Harmer, head of waste and energy. This may bring
opportunities over the next year to 18 months, he said.  Sweden plans to get half of its energy from clean sources
by 2020, from 47 percent now, and the U.K. is aiming for 15
percent, up from about 9.4 percent. Both subsidize renewable
energy by placing an obligation on electricity suppliers to buy
a certain portion of their power from low-carbon sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
