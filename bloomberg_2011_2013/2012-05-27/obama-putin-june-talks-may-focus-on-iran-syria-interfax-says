Presidents  Barack Obama  and Vladimir Putin may focus on Iran and Syria during talks the leaders plan
during the G20 summit in Mexico next month, Interfax reported,
citing U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul.  International sanctions against Iran have spurred the
nation to start negotiations on its nuclear program with six
countries, McFaul told Interfax in an interview. The question of
how sanctions on Iran might affect Russia’s economic interests
is a “delicate” one, the  news agency  cited McFaul as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
