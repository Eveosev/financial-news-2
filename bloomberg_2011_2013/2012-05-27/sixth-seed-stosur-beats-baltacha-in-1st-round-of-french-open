Sam Stosur of Australia defeated
Britain’s Elena Baltacha in the opening round of the French
Open.  Stosur, the reigning U.S. Open champion, beat Baltacha 6-4,
6-0 on the opening day of the clay-court Grand Slam event held
at  Roland Garros  in Paris.  The sixth-seeded Stosur made the finals in Paris in 2010,
where she lost to Italy’s Francesca Schiavone. Former U.S. Open
champion Andy Roddick and five-time Wimbledon champion Venus
Williams are scheduled to play later today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
