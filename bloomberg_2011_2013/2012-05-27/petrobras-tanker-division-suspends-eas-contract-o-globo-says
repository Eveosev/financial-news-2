Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ’s Transpetro
transportation unit suspended contracts with Estaleiro Atlantico
Sul shipyard worth 5.3 billion reais ($2.7 billion) to build 16
oil tankers, O Globo reported, citing an interview with
Transpetro President Sergio Machado.  To resume the contracts, Estaleiro Atlantico Sul, known as
EAS, has until Aug. 30 to find a new partner to provide
technology to the shipyard after  Samsung Heavy Industries Co. (010140) 
sold its stake in the business, Machado told the Rio de Janeiro-
based newspaper.  Camargo Correa and Queiroz Galvao, EAS’s controlling
shareholders, said the company agreed with the suspension of the
contracts, O Globo reported without saying how it obtained the
information. EAS is in talks with Japan-based Ishikawajima-
Harima Heavy Industries to fulfill Transpetro’s demands, the
newspaper said, without identifying where the information came
from.  Transpetro didn’t respond to calls to mobile-phone and
fixed-line telephone numbers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
