A Bahrain court sentenced six people
to 15 years in jail each for plotting terrorism inside the
kingdom, including an attack on the causeway to  Saudi Arabia ,
state-run Bahrain News Agency said.  Two other defendants were acquitted, BNA said today, citing
Osama al-Oufi, head of prosecution.  The  Interior Ministry  said on Nov. 12 that it had
discovered a plot “to carry out terror attacks against vital
establishments and individuals in the kingdom,” including the
King Fahd Causeway, the ministry’s building, Saudi Arabia’s
embassy and unidentified individuals.  The suspects had received military training in Shiite
Muslim-led  Iran , while others were on their way to that country
when they were arrested, the public prosecutor said in November.  Bahrain has accused Iran of supporting mass demonstrations
in the kingdom by Shiites last year and protests that have
continued in Shiite villages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
