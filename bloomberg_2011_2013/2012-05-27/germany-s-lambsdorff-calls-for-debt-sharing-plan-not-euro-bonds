A senior politician in  Germany ’s Free
Democratic Party backed a European debt-sharing plan proposed by
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s council of economic advisers as an
alternative to joint euro-area bonds.  The proposed 2.3 trillion euro ($2.9 trillion) redemption
fund would be big enough to shield Italy and  Spain  from
“speculative attacks,” Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, chairman of
the FDP group in the European Parliament, wrote in a guest
editorial for  Spiegel Online . The fund wouldn’t result in
transfer payments between European countries, he said.  “It’s time to sign off on the pact,” Lambsdorff said.
He said the pact could be sealed immediately because it’s a deal
between states and doesn’t require a European contract. He also
said the pact, as an agreement between states, is “outside
European law” and therefore doesn’t violate the prohibition on
bailouts, as “some people” claim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
