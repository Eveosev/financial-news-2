General Healthcare Group, a U.K.
private hospital operator, is in talks with lenders that could
lead to a takeover of the company, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  GHG, which trades as BMI Healthcare and is owned by Apax
Partners LLP and  Netcare Ltd. (NTC) , has to pay back 2.3 billion
pounds ($3.6 billion) of loans used to fund its acquisition in
2006 by October 2013, according to the newspaper. Apax and
Netcare must inject capital into GHG or repay the debt with
equity in the business.  GHG has hired Rothschild Bank AG to advise it on talks with
bond holders. KKR & Co. LP and D.E. Shaw & Co. bought a portion
of GHGâ€™s debt, the London-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
