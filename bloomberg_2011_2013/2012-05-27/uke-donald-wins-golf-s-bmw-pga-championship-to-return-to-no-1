England’s Luke Donald retained his
BMW PGA Championship title and returned to No. 1 in the golf
rankings, three weeks after ceding top spot to Rory McIlroy.  The 34-year-old finished on 15-under par at Wentworth near
 London , four shots ahead of countryman  Justin Rose  and
Scotland’s  Paul Lawrie , to record a seventh victory on the
European Tour.  “To come here and defend, and get back to No. 1 as a side
note, is very sweet indeed,” Donald told the British
Broadcasting Corp.  Donald first led the  Official World Golf Ranking  by winning
this tournament a year ago and has held the position for 45
weeks, with Northern Ireland’s McIlroy having three brief spells
at the top totaling seven weeks.  McIlroy failed to make the cut two days ago after finishing
in a tie for 133rd out of 150 at the halfway point. He also had
an early exit at the  Players Championship  in  Florida  two weeks
ago.  Donald, the overnight leader heading into today’s final
round, only needed a top-eight finish to return to No. 1. He
bogeyed the par-5 fourth hole before hitting five birdies in his
4-under round.  Donald, who also has five victories on the U.S. PGA Tour,
collects a check for 750,000 euros ($940,000).  Lawrie came into contention with a 6-under round and
finished in a tie for second when Rose missed a putt on the
final green. Peter Lawrie of Ireland was another three shots
back.  Germany’s Marcel Siem, who finished joint seventh, had a
hole in one at the second hole today.
