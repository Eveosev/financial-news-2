Amtrak  said rail service between
Washington and Philadelphia has been temporarily suspended
because of problems with overhead wires north of Baltimore, the
railroad said in an e-mailed statement.  Earlier, Amtrak said it suspended service between
Wilmington, Delaware, and Baltimore because of the problematic
wires. The railroad said it didn’t have any estimate on when
service will be restored and expected “significant delays” on
trains between Washington and New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
