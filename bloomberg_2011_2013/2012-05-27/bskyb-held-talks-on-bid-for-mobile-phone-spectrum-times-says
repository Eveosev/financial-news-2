British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) 
held talks about buying part of the U.K.’s mobile-phone airways
from Everything Everywhere Ltd., the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  BSkyB has met with Morgan Stanley, which is running the
spectrum auction, though the broadcaster’s interest in the
acquisition has waned since the talks, the newspaper said.
BskyB’s purchase of its first slice of British mobile-phone
airways may cost as much as 4 billion pounds ($6.3 billion),
according to the report.  Everything Everywhere is the U.K. venture of  France Telecom
SA (FTE)  and Deutsche Telekom AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
