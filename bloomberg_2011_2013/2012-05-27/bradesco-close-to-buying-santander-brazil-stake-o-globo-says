Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  is close to buying
a stake in the Brazilian unit of rival Santander SA,  O Globo 
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  Bradesco declined to comment, according to a press officer,
who asked not to be identified because of internal policy.
Santander didnâ€™t answer Bloomberg calls to mobile-phone and
fixed-line numbers for its press office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
