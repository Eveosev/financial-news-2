Iran  put in place a system for
international transactions after being cut off by Swift, the
global bank-transfer messaging service,  Press TV  reported,
citing Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani.  Iran already activated the system, Bahmani said yesterday,
according to a report published by the state-run  news agency .
He didnâ€™t provide further details.  On March 17, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication, known as Swift, halted service for about 24
Iranian lenders sanctioned by the European Union, including the
central bank. The cutoff was a response to EU regulations issued
a day earlier that ban financial-messaging services for entities
subject to an EU asset freeze.  Iran is under  United Nations , European Union and U.S.
punitive measures to force it to curb its nuclear activities,
which the U.S. administration and its allies accuse of being
aimed at developing weapons. Iran denies the charges, saying its
intentions are purely civilian.  To contact the reporter on this story:
