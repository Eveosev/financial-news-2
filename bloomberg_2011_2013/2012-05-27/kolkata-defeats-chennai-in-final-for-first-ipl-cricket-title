Kolkata Knight Riders beat two-time
defending champion Chennai Super Kings by five wickets in the
final of cricket’s Indian Premier League last night to win the
title for a first time.  Manvinder Bisla top-scored with 89 runs, while  Jacques Kallis  made 69 for Kolkata, which reached its victory target in
Chennai with two balls remaining as Manoj Tiwary struck two
straight boundaries.  Kolkata finished on 192-5 after Chennai had posted 190-3
from its 20 overs. Chennai has appeared in four of the
competition’s five finals since its introduction in 2008, while
Kolkata was playing in the showpiece for a first time.  Chennai appeared on course to win the IPL for a third
straight year after  Suresh Raina  cracked 73 from 38 balls to
lift his team to a commanding total.  Kolkata then lost a wicket in the opening over of its reply
before Bisla and Kallis put on 136 for the second wicket. A run
of four wickets for 36 runs brought Shakib Al Hasan and Tiwary
to the crease, with Tiwary scoring nine runs from three balls to
take his team to victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
