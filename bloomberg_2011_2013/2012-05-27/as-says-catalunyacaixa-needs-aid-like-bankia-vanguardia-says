Catalan regional President Artur Mas
and Josep Duran i Lleida, a spokesman for Catalan party CiU, met
with Spanish Economy minister Luis de Guindos on Friday to
discuss the future of savings bank CatalunyaCaixa,  La Vanguardia 
said.  Mas and Duran said that CatalunyaCaixa should receive the
same treatment as the Bankia Group, the lender nationalized
earlier this month and thatâ€™s asking for 19 billion euros ($23.8
billion) of state funds to clean up its balance sheet, the
newspaper reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge of
the matter.  The meeting also discussed whether Bankia, Caixa Galicia
and CatalunyaCaixa will remain independent, with their
management teams intact and without merging to create a state-
owned bank, despite the fact that the state will soon own all of
them, La Vanguardia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
