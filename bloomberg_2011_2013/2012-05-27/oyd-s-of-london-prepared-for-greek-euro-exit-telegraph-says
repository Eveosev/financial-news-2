Lloyd’s of London Ltd. is prepared
for a collapse of the European single currency that may be
triggered if  Greece  leaves the euro,  The Sunday Telegraph  said,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Richard Ward.  Lloyd’s has a contingency plan to switch from euro
underwriting to multi-currency settlement if Greece returns to
the drachma, the newspaper said.  The insurance provider has reduced its exposure as far as
possible to euro-area countries and it may have to accept
writedowns on some of its 58.9 billion pounds ($92.3 billion) of
assets under management, the paper said, citing Ward.  Lloyd’s spokesman John Battersby confirmed the remarks were
made in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph when contacted by
Bloomberg News. He declined to comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
