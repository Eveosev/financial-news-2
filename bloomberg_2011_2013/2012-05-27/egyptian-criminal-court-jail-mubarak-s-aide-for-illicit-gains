An Egyptian criminal court sentenced
an aide of ousted President  Hosni Mubarak  to seven years in jail
and fined him 36 million pounds ($6 million) for making illicit
gains.  Zakareya Azmi, who was head of Mubarak’s office and member
of parliament, was found guilty of exploiting his position to
make about 42 million pounds, according to an e-mailed statement
from the court today. Azmi was also an official in Mubarak’s
dissolved  National Democratic Party .  A verdict on Mubarak, who is accused of complicity in the
killings of more than 800 protesters during last year’s 18-day
mass revolt which led to his ouster, is due on June 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
