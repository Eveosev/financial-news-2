Soho House Group, a chain of private
membersâ€™ clubs in the U.K. and America, will open five new
venues by 2014, the Sunday Times reported, without saying where
it got the information.  New clubs will open in Barcelona, Istanbul, Mumbai and
Toronto, it said, as well as in Chicago. Billionaire  Ron Burkle 
bought a 60 percent stake in the group for 15 million pounds
($23.5 million) in January, it said.  The company is expected to report increased revenue for the
year to January and a 16 percent increase in pretax profit to 18
million pounds, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
