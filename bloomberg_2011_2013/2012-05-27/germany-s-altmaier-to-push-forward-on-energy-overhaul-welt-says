German Environment Minister  Peter Altmaier  will push forward with the country’s switch away from
nuclear energy, saying the country can’t afford a holdup on the
issue,  Welt am Sonntag  reported, citing an interview.  The change in leadership from the fired former minister
Norbert Roettgen will help “surmount blockades” against the
new policies, the newspaper quoted Altmaier as saying. “Nuclear
energy in  Germany  is history. The exit has been decided.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
