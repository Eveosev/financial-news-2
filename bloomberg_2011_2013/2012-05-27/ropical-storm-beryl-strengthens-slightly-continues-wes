Tropical Storm Beryl, the second
named storm of the 2012  Atlantic hurricane season , strengthened
slightly as it continues to move west, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory.  The weather system is about 110 miles (176 kilometers) east
of Jacksonville, Florida, the Miami-based center said in the
advisory posted at 1:54 p.m.  New York  time. The stormâ€™s maximum
sustained winds increased to 65 mph from 60 mph three hours
earlier, the center said. Beryl is moving at 10 mph.  A storm becomes tropical when thunderstorm activity begins
building close to the center of circulation, according to
Weather Underground Inc. of Ann Arbor, Michigan. A subtropical
storm usually has a large cloud-free center of circulation,
Weather Underground said.  Tropical storm warnings stretch from the Volusia/Brevard
County border in Florida to Edisto Beach,  South Carolina , the
hurricane center said. Tropical-storm conditions will reach the
northeastern Florida coast and southeastern Georgia this
afternoon and continue through tonight, the agency said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
