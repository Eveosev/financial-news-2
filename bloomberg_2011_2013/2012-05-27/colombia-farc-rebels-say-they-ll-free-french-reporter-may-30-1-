Colombia ’s FARC guerrillas say they
will release French reporter Romeo Langlois on May 30, according
to a  statement  published on the group’s website last night.  The leftist group said it will give coordinates for
Langlois’s recovery to the Red Cross, former senator Piedad Cordoba and a French delegation.  Langlois was captured April 28 when guerrillas attacked
troops on a counter-narcotics operation he was filming. He was
injured during a firefight.  FARC is the Spanish acronym for the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, the group that has been waging war against
the nation’s government for almost five decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
