The  Swiss National Bank (SNBN)  may introduce
measures in addition to the franc ceiling of 1.20 per euro
adopted in September, if it comes to further shocks on the
 currency markets ,  NZZ am Sonntag  reported, citing SNB spokesman
Walter Meier.  The central bank several months ago formed a task-force
with the heads of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs and
the Federal Department of Finance for emergency planning, which
“examines the application of measures which go beyond the
competencies of the central bank -- for instance the
introduction of capital flow check,” Meier told the Zurich-
based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
