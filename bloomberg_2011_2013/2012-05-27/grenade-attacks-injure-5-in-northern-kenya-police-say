Grenade attacks at a refugee camp and
a hotel in two northeastern Kenyan towns wounded five people
yesterday, the police said.  In one attack, four construction workers at the Ifo refugee
camp run by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in
Garissa, about 327 kilometers (203 miles) from the capital
Nairobi, were injured, Leo Nyongesa, head of police in the
region, said. One person at a hotel in the town of Wajir, was
wounded, he said.  Earlier this month, one woman was shot dead during a
grenade attack that also injured five people at a nightclub in
the port city of  Mombasa  on May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
