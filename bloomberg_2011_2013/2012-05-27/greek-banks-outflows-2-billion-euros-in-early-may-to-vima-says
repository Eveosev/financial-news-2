Withdrawals from Greek banks reached
2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in the period from May 1 to May

the time, to President Karolos Papoulias.  The withdrawals were prompted by economic uncertainty and
concern over a possible exit of  Greece  from the euro area, the
Athens-based newspaper said today, citing the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
