Andy Roddick , the last American man
to have won a major title, was upset in the opening round of the
French Open by France’s Nicolas Mahut.  Roddick, a 2003 U.S. Open champion, was beaten by the 88th-
ranked Mahut, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 on Court Suzanne Lenglen at
Roland Garros.   Roddick, a former world No. 1, had been trying to win his
first match on clay this season. The 26th-seeded player lost all
three matches he played for the U.S. at last week’s World Team
Cup in Dusseldorf,  Germany . The 29-year-old American missed clay
courts events in Rome and Madrid in the run-up to Roland Garros
due to a hamstring injury. That same injury had forced Roddick
to retire in the second round of the Australian Open in January.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
