Francois Hollande , who was sworn in
as president of France on May 15, had a 61 percent approval
rating in the first Ifop poll of his presidency.  Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, who was sworn in a day
after Hollande, had a 65 percent approval rating.  Former President  Nicolas Sarkozy  had a 65 percent approval
rating in the first poll after his election five years earlier,
and ended his term at 36 percent, lower than that of any other
French president since 1958 at a similar point.  The monthly survey, for the newspaper  Journal du Dimanche, 
questioned 1,879 people and was carried out May 18-25. No margin
