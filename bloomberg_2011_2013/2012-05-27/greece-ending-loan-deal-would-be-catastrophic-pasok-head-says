Greek voters face a choice between
supporting a review of the country’s aid package or the “blind
and catastrophic” route of terminating the deal unilaterally,
said  Evangelos Venizelos , leader of the socialist Pasok party.  Breaking the deal would also strengthen “extreme forces”
speculating on Greece exiting the euro and returning to the
drachma, with the aim of buying state and private assets
cheaply, Venizelos told reporters in Athens today in comments
broadcast live on state-run NET TV.  The idea of reviewing Greece’s financial aid agreement with
international lenders is gaining acceptance in  Europe  and the
program may be extended to 2017, Venizelos said. Greece holds an
election on June 17.  Pasok, the second-largest pro-bailout party after  New
Democracy , was placed third in six Greek opinion polls published
yesterday. New Democracy led all the polls, while Syriza, which
is against implementing the terms of the deal, was second.  To contact the reporters on this story:
