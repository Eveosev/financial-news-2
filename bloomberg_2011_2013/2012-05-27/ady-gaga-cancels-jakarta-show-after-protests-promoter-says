Lady Gaga canceled her show in
Jakarta scheduled for June 3 after protests against her
 performance , according to a spokesman for the Indonesian
promoter of the concert.  “Lady Gaga’s management choose not to go ahead with the
show,” Arif Ramadhoni, Big Daddy’s spokesman said by telephone
today, confirming a report by the Jakarta Globe newspaper. “The
management respects the local dynamics and aspiration.”  Members of the Islamic Defenders Front protested earlier
this month against the concert, saying Lady Gaga’s performances
were pornography and that her purpose was to destroy the
country’s morals.  Indonesia , with 240 million people, has the
world’s largest Muslim population.  The Jakarta police recommended her concert permit be
declined based on inputs from “various elements of society”
and to prevent disturbances, Senior Police Commissioner
Rikwanto, head of public relations for the Jakarta Police
Department, said May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
