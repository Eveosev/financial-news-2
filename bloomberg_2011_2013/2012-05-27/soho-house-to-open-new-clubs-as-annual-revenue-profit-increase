Soho House Group, a chain of private
members’ clubs in the U.K. and the U.S., said it will open five
new venues by 2014 after reporting increased revenue and profit
for 2011.  Clubs will open in Barcelona, Istanbul, Mumbai, Toronto and
 Chicago , London-based Soho House said in an e-mailed statement
today. Revenue rose 19 percent to 132 million pounds ($207
million), while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization climbed by 16 percent to 18 million pounds, on a
pro-rata basis.  “I’m delighted that the Soho House family is set to
grow,”  Nick Jones , founder and chief executive officer, said in
the statement. “We’ve been working on these projects for a long
time, seeking out the right properties and locations in the
cities we want to be in.” Billionaire  Ron Burkle  bought a stake
in the group in January and assumed the role of chairman.  The Sunday Times newspaper reported Soho House’s expansion
and financial news earlier. The company, founded in 1995, will
also open another Pizza East site in Kentish Town in north
 London , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
