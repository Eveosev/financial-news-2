Spain  plans to inject public debt
instead of cash directly into the Bankia Group to pay for the
bank’s recapitalization and avoid having to go to market with
the instruments,  El Pais  reported, without citing anyone.  Until now, to pay for bank bailouts, the state would sell
debt in the market through its bank rescue fund, known as the
FROB, and use the cash to aid banks. A jump in yields has made
debt sales more difficult and expensive, El Pais said.  The government has been planning to use this strategy for
weeks and the bailout of Bankia precipitated events, the
newspaper added. A spokesman for the Economy Ministry wasn’t
immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
