U.K. lawmaker Richard Ottaway said
he’ll introduce a bill to reform the scrap-metal industry in a
bid to counter increasing theft.  Metal pilfering disrupted 36,000 train services last year,
school and church roofs have been stripped and phone cable
damaged, Ottaway, a member of the  Conservative Party , said in an
e-mailed statement today. His bill would increase legal
deterrents to dealing in stolen metal and make it harder to buy.  “We need new legislation to disrupt and then shut down the
trade in stolen metal, taking action against those stealing it
and selling it on,” he said. “It is time to look at the
sentencing guidelines, to see if they need strengthening to
ensure the full impact of metal-theft crime is taken into
account.”  Theft of metals including copper and lead costs the U.K.
economy an estimated 770 million pounds ($1.2 billion) annually
after doubling in five years, the  Association of British
Insurers  said May 21. Elevated prices and ease of access to
metals are driving thefts, according to the group.  Ottaway will introduce the private members’ bill to reform
the Scrap Metal Dealer’s Act 1964.  To contact the reporter on this story:
