The European Union is working on
plans to set up a rescue fund for ailing banks, capitalized by
levies imposed on the lenders, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  It will be funded by annual payments from all banks in the
 euro zone  to ensure consumer deposits are guaranteed, and will
be backed by cash from the European Union, the  European Central
Bank  or the European Stability Mechanism, the newspaper
reported.  The fund may also have the power to take over crisis-hit
lenders, according to the Sunday Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
