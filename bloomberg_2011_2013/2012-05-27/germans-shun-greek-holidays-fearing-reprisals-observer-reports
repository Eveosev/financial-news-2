German holidaymakers canceled
thousands of planned vacations in  Greece  since May 6,  The
Observer  reported, citing the president of the Association of
Greek Tourism Enterprises.  Germans fear the consequences of being seen as the source
of the austerity regime imposed on Greece as a condition of the
bailout funds from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund , the newspaper said.  Most of the 50,000 cancellations since the inconclusive
election this month were made by Germans, the paper reported.
German arrivals in Greece will be down 25 percent this year,
Andreas Andreadis said, according to The Observer.  In a poll conducted by the Foundation of Future Studies,
out of 4,000 Germans interviewed, 1.1 percent were planning a
vacation in Greece this summer, down by almost half since last
year and two-thirds since 2009, The Observer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
