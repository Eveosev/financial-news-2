Brazil â€™s chief of staff Gleisi
Hoffmann said there are no plans to partially suspend operations
at Galeao airport in  Rio de Janeiro  during the Rio+20
conference, Folha de Sao Paulo reported.  Hoffmann said the government is considering rescheduling
some of the commercial flights on June 22, when most of the
heads of state attending the meeting plan to leave, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper reported.  The conference commemorating the landmark 1992 UN
environmental summit, which also took place in Rio, is scheduled
for June 20 to June 22.  Folha reported yesterday, without saying where it obtained
the information, that the government was planning to close the
airport for part of a day during the summit in a move that might
force companies to cancel about 100 flights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
