Copenhagen Airports A/S may invite
bids for its 49 percent stake in Newcastle Airport in the U.K.,
the Sunday Times reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Newcastle has attracted interest from funds including  3i
Group Plc (III) , Antin Infrastructure Partners SAS and  IMF Australia
Ltd. (IMF) , the newspaper said. Copenhagen Airports is in talks about
restructuring its debt, with 320 million pounds ($501 million)
due in December next year, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
