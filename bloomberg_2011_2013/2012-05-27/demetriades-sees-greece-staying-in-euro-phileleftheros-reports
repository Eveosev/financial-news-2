European  Central Bank  Governing
Council member Panicos Demetriades said he is optimistic that
Greece won’t leave the euro area as growth policies in  Europe 
gradually take hold,  Phileleftheros  reported.  Greece’s elected officials will “rise to the
circumstances,” regardless of the outcome of the country’s June
17 ballot, the Nicosia-based newspaper reported, citing
Demetriades, who is also governor of the  Central Bank of Cyprus .  The east Mediterranean island’s central bank and  finance
ministry  are working together to protect its tax regime, which
attracts offshore companies, in the event that Cyprus pursues a
financial bailout, Phileleftheros cited Demetriades as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
