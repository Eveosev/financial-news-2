Gambia and U.S.-based  Camac Energy
Inc. (CAK)  signed a contract for the exploration and production of
offshore oil, state-run media said, in the West African
country’s first agreement of its kind with a foreign company.  The government selected Camac from among three explorers
shortlisted for drilling rights at Gambia’s A2 and A5
concessions, the oil ministry said in a statement broadcast
yesterday over state-owned radio and GRTS television. Camac,
with headquarters in Houston, has operations in  Nigeria  and,
through subsidiaries, in  China .  The company will work closely with Gambia National
Petroleum Corp. and the oil ministry, an unidentified Camac
official who signed the agreement said from Lagos, Nigeria,
according to the ministry. Gambian President Yahya Jammeh
assured Camac of a conducive working environment and said the
government wants “a mutually rewarding partnership.”  Gambia, with a population of about 1.8 million people, is
the smallest country in mainland Africa. Its economic growth may
be “slightly negative” this year because of crop failure and
anticipated lower tourism revenue, the  International Monetary
Fund  said on March 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
