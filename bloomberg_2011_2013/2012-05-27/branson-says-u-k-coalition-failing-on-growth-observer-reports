Richard Branson  said the U.K.’s
coalition government has failed to promote economic growth,  The
Observer  reported, citing an interview with the chairman and
founder of Virgin Group Ltd.  Small- and medium-sized businesses are the “engines” of a
healthy economy, The Observer cited Branson as saying.
Politicians’ talk of encouraging lending to such companies
wasn’t matched by action, he said.  The U.K. must ease procedures for setting up businesses,
reduce taxes and regulations, and focus on helping smaller
companies, Branson said, according to the newspaper. Companies
should be exempt from paying national insurance on new employees
for the first two years, he said.  British schools should teach business and money-management
skills as part of the national curriculum, Branson said,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
