Tropical Storm Beryl, the second
named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, will make
landfall tonight near northeastern  Florida , the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said in an  advisory .  A warning is in effect from the Brevard-Volusia County line
in Florida to Edisto Beach,  South Carolina .  The weather system is about 85 miles (140 kilometers) east
of Jacksonville, Florida, the Miami-based center said in the
advisory posted at 4:42 p.m.  New York  time. The storm’s maximum
sustained winds are 65 miles per hour, the center said. Beryl is
moving at 10 mph and is expected to turn northward over
southeastern Georgia by Monday night.  The storm may strengthen “slightly” before landfall, the
center said, and gusts may reach hurricane-level over parts of
northeastern Florida and southeastern Georgia tonight and early
tomorrow. Flooding is possible with water rising up to 4 feet
above ground, according to the center.  Beryl is expected to weaken steadily to a so-called
tropical depression by Monday night.  A storm becomes tropical when thunderstorm activity begins
building close to the center of circulation, according to
 Weather Underground  Inc. of Ann Arbor, Michigan. A subtropical
storm usually has a large cloud-free center of circulation,
Weather Underground said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
