Forward  Chris Bosh , recovering from a
strained abdominal muscle, may not return for the Miami Heat’s
National Basketball Association Eastern Conference final series
against the Boston Celtics, coach Erik Spoelstra said.  The Heat host the Celtics in Game 1 of the series tomorrow
with games every other day until one team wins the best-of-seven
series.  Bosh was injured in Game 1 of the Heat’s semifinal series
against the Indiana Pacers. He averaged 18 points and 7.9
rebounds during the season and 14.7 points and 6.8 rebounds
through Miami’s first six playoff games, including five against
the  New York  Knicks.  “He’s doing a little bit more, he’s still indefinite,”
Spoelstra told reporters yesterday. “For me, it’s my
responsibility right now to prepare this team without him.”  Spoelstra said the team, led by  LeBron James  and  Dwyane Wade , must be prepared to make up for the loss of Bosh through
the conference finals.  “What I told them as a team is we have to go to the next
level,” Spoelstra said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
