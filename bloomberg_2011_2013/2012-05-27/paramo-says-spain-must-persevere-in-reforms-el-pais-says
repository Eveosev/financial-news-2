Spain ’s People’s Party has done more
in less time to improve the country’s financial situation than
any other government but must persevere further, European
Central Bank Executive Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo
said in an interview with El Pais.  “In terms of the  budget deficit  much has been done but
given the magnitude of the adjustment, time is needed to recover
a reputation of discipline,”  El Pais  cited Paramo as saying.  Paramo added that he has “no doubt” that Spain will reach
its budget deficit target of 5.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
