Rajon Rondo’s 18 points, 10 rebounds
and 10 assists sparked the  Boston Celtics  to an 85-75 victory
over the  Philadelphia 76ers  to advance to the National
Basketball Association’s Eastern Conference finals against the
Miami Heat.  The Celtics, who won the seven-game series 4-3, travel to
Miami tomorrow for Game 1 against the Heat, who won their
second-round series 4-2 over the Indiana Pacers. In the Western
Conference finals, the  San Antonio Spurs  host the Oklahoma City
Thunder in Game 1 tonight.  Rondo’s ninth playoff triple-double ties him with Wilt
Chamberlain, who is fourth on the career list behind Magic
Johnson (30), Jason Kidd (11) and Larry Bird (10). Rondo was
held to seven points in the first three quarters and then scored
nine straight after  Paul Pierce  fouled out with 4:10 left in the
game.  “Rondo wants to run the team” coach Doc Rivers said in a
televised press conference. “He’s a great quarterback. When
Paul fouled out he had to take over.”  Kevin Garnett contributed 18 points and grabbed 13 rebounds
while  Brandon Bass  had 16 and Pierce added 15 at TD Garden in
 Boston .  “It’s a team effort and we won like a team,” Rondo said.  The 76ers fought back from a 41-33 halftime deficit to
trail 55-54 on Thaddeus Young’s tip-in with 10 minutes, 56
seconds left in the final quarter.  “I thought if we could get 85, we could win,” said
Philadelphia coach  Doug Collins . “We just never could get back
over the top. Rondo took over the game in the last four or five
minutes.”  Andre Iguodala scored 18 points and Jrue Holiday and Elton Brand added 15 points each for the 76ers.  The Heat lost 4-2 last year to Dallas after beating the
Mavericks 4-2 in 2005-06 for their last championship title.  The Celtics beat Los Angeles 4-2 in 2007-08 and then lost
to the Lakers in the final game of the series in 2009-10.  “They’re going to have a hard-fought series against the
Heat,” Collins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
