Asian art collectors and wine lovers,
undaunted by economic concern elsewhere in the world, flocked to
Hong Kong sales held by five auction houses to snap up imperials
of Petrus, Chinese paintings and snuff bottles.  Christie’s International five-day spring sale starting on
May 26 sold 100 percent of the lots at its wine auction, while
more than 90 percent of Asian contemporary and 20th-century
works found buyers at the evening session, for a total of HK$362
million ($46.7 million). The presale estimate for the series by
Christie’s is as much as $260 million.  “It was pretty good,” Edouard Malingue, a Hong Kong-based
dealer, said at Christie’s. “Everybody was forecasting it would
be bad because of the economic problems of  Europe .”  The most expensive lot of the evening was “Blue
Chrysanthemum in a Glass Vase” by 20th-century Chinese artist
Sanyu. The oil painting sold for HK$47.7 million, beating a
presale highest estimate of HK$28 million.  A record was set for Indonesian artist Affandi, when his
work entitled “At the Cockfight” sold for HK$5.54 million with
fees, more than three times its highest estimate at hammer
prices.  Fine-wine demand proved resilient at  Zachys  May 25-26 sale,
where 97 percent of lots sold. The New York-based auction house
sold HK$57.59 worth of wine, led by a six-liter methuselah of
Romanee-Conti Domaine de la Romanee-Conti that fetched HK$1.16
million.  Imperials of Petrus  The most expensive lot at Christie’s wine sale was a parcel
of four six-liter imperials of Petrus from 2005-2008, selling
for more than HK$780,000 including a 22 percent commission,
compared with presales estimates of HK$500,000 to HK$700,000.  Acker, Merrall & Condit , the world’s largest wine auction
house, said it earned more than HK$70 million on May 25-26, with
95 percent of more than 1,000 lots sold. The top lot was a case
of 1947 Cheval Blanc that sold for HK$1.48 million.  Taipei-based  Ravenel International Art Group  was the latest
auction house to tap the  Hong Kong  market with its inaugural
wine sale yesterday.  The sale raised HK$15.4 million including HK$1.5 million
paid for an assortment of seven jeroboams (three liters) of
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti.  Though just 73 percent of the 305 lots sold, Elaine Holt,
vice president of art auctions who runs Ravenel’s Hong Kong
office said the company had made a reasonable start.  “There are so many auctions and so much wine available so
it’s hard to do really,” she said. “It was so-so but most of
our top lots sold well.”  Snuff Bottles  Bonhams  also achieved 100 percent success in its auction of
168 snuff bottles yesterday, raising HK$42.4 million. The top
lot was an enameled copper-with-gold bottle made for the
Qianlong emperor between 1736-1775 that sold for HK$4.8 million.  Bonhams raised HK$313 million from wine, cognac, ceramics,
jewelry and Chinese paintings, led by an oil-on-gaoli paper
portrait of imperial consort Chunhui attributed to Italian
missionary-artist Giuseppe Castiglione in the 18th century that
sold for HK$39.86 million yesterday.  Christie’s sales of modern and traditional Chinese painting,
watches, jewels and ceramics run through May 30.  To contact the writer on the story:
