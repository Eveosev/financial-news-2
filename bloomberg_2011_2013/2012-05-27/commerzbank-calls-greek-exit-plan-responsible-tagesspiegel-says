Martin Zielke, the head of
 Commerzbank AG (CBK) ’s private customers unit, said planning for the
possibility of a Greek exit from the euro is the responsible
thing to do,  Der Tagesspiegel  reported, citing an interview.  “It’s simply an imperative of responsibility to prepare
for all eventualities,” the newspaper quoted Zielke as saying
in an e-mailed preview of an interview to be published on May
29. “Furthermore a Greek exit, should it come, would not mean
the end of the euro.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
