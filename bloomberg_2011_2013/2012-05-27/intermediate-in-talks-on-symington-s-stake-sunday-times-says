Intermediate Capital Group Plc (ICP)  is in
talks to buy a stake in Symington’s, a U.K. food producer which
is seeking capital to buy new brands, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying how it got the information.  Symington’s, owned by Bridgepoint Development Capital, may
be looking to buy  Premier Foods Plc (PFD) ’s Angel Delight and Birds
Custard brands, the newspaper reported, and has been exploring
ways to raise cash. Intermediate Capital may purchase a “big”
stake, the Sunday Times said, without further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
