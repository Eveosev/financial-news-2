Johnson Controls Inc. (JSI) , the biggest
U.S. auto-parts supplier, will buy 49 percent of Turkish car-
battery seller  Karat Guc Sistemleri Sanayi & Ticaret AS  through
two subsidiaries,  Turkey â€™s antitrust authority said.  CRH Otomotiv Sanayi & Ticaret Ltd. Sti, wholly owned by
Johnson Controls, and Johnson Controls Hybrid & Recycling GmbH
will buy the stake, the regulator said on its  website.   Istanbul-based Karat distributes several battery brands,
including Varta and Energizer, both owned by Johnson Controls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
