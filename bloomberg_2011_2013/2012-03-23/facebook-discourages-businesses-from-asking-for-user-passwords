Facebook Inc. (FB) , the world’s biggest
social-networking service, said reports of businesses asking
potential employees for passwords are “alarming” and
discouraged users and companies from engaging in the practice.  The company may ask policy makers to intercede or even take
legal action, Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan said on the
company’s site today. That could include shutting down
applications that abuse privileges, she said.  Facebook, which  filed  for an initial public offering last
month, has come under growing scrutiny over the privacy of its
users. Earlier this week, the  Associated Press  reported that
some companies and government agencies are asking potential job
candidates for Facebook passwords, drawing a rebuke from the
 American Civil Liberties Union  and now Facebook itself.  “As a user, you shouldn’t be forced to share your private
information and communications just to get a job,” Egan said.
“As the friend of a user, you shouldn’t have to worry that your
private information or communications will be revealed to
someone you don’t know and didn’t intend to share with just
because that user is looking for a job.”  The company already has made it a violation of
its Statement of Rights and Responsibilities to share or solicit
a Facebook password, Egan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
