U.S. feedlots boosted purchases of
young cattle by 2.8 percent in February from a year earlier, as
rising prices for slaughter-ready livestock spurred expectations
that profits would expand.  Feedlots (CATTLEPL)  bought 1.714 million head of cattle last month, up
from 1.667 million in February 2011, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Twelve analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected a 2.9 percent gain, on average. The
feedlot herd totaled 11.677 million as of March 1, up 2.6
percent from a year earlier. Analysts expected a 2.5 percent
increase.  The spot-market price of slaughter-ready  steers  sold to
meatpackers climbed to $1.30 a pound on Feb. 20, the  highest 
since at least November 2002, USDA data show. The price of corn,
a key feed ingredient, dropped 6.2 percent in the past year
through yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Wholesale
choice beef surged to $1.988 a pound on Feb. 29, the highest
since at least January 2004.  “People were looking at some record prices of fattened
cattle going out to market,” Daniel Bluntzer, the research
director at Frontier Risk Management in Robstown,  Texas , said in
a telephone interview earlier this week. “The beef market
really came alive, so there was a lot of chasing of animals.”  Feedlot Losses  Feedlots without risk-management plans still lost about $70
per head sold in February, as the price of young cattle also
surged,  Ron Plain , a livestock economist at the  University of
Missouri  in Columbia, said in a telephone interview. Spot-market
feeder cattle tracked by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange climbed
to $1.5919 a pound on Feb. 28, the highest since at least 1996.  Feedlots may have been willing to buy, or place, young
cattle at near record highs because they were optimistic that
the price of slaughter-ready cattle would rally further,
Bluntzer said. Feedlots buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds. The animals are fattened
on corn for about five months until they weigh about 1,200
pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  “Just because you place a loser doesn’t mean you’ll sell
it as a loser,” Bluntzer said.  Feedlots sold about 1.755 million animals to meatpackers
last month, down 2 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected a 0.4 percent decline, on average.  Fattened cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.6 percent
to $1.2140 a pound at 12:53 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Before today, the most-active contract gained 7.3
percent in the past year. Feeder-cattle futures for May
settlement dropped 0.5 percent to $1.5395 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
