Tryg A/S (TRYG)  rose to its highest in six
weeks in Copenhagen trading after Danske Bank A/S said clients
should buy the stock because the second-largest Nordic property
and casualty insurer is getting better at managing its costs.  Tryg rose as much as 1.7 percent to 318.5 kroner, the
highest price since Feb. 8, making it today’s biggest winner in
the  MSCI Nordic Financials Index (MXND0FN)  (MXND0FN) of 16 companies. The shares
rose 3.3 kroner to 316.4 kroner at 2:35 p.m. in the Danish
capital.  Danske’s Per Gronborg today raised his recommendation on
Tryg to buy from hold, saying the Ballerup, Denmark-based
company should no longer trade at a discount to other insurers.
Tryg had a combined ratio, a measure of costs and claims as a
percentage of premiums, of 93.5 in 2011, compared with 90.3 for
 Topdanmark A/S (TOP) , its biggest listed Danish rival, according to
the two companies’ recent earnings reports.  “Tryg has been the high top-line growth, high claims
inflation story with a low cash conversion, but we see the
profile changing,” Copenhagen-based Gronborg said in a note.  He raised his 12-month price estimate on Tryg shares to 385
kroner from 320 kroner. With that increase, the  average price
estimate  advanced to a 10-week high of 317.4 kroner today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg that includes surveys
from 13 analysts.  Peter Fledelius, Nordea Market’s analyst in Copenhagen, on
March 16 also raised his recommendation on Tryg shares to buy
from hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
