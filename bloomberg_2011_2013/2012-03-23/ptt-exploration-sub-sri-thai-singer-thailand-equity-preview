Shares of the following companies

week’s advance to 0.4 percent.  Krung Thai Bank Pcl (KTB)  , the nation’s second-biggest
lender, dropped 2.7 percent to 18 baht, the biggest decline
since Jan. 5. Krung Thai, controlled by the central bank’s
rescue fund, plans to raise capital for expansion this year,
said Krirk Vanikkul, deputy governor at the Bank of Thailand.
The bank hasn’t yet proposed the plan to the Financial
Institutions Development Fund, Krirk said today.  Singer (Thailand) Pcl (SINGER)  , a Thai electrical
appliance seller, jumped 10 percent to 9.15 baht, the highest

Managing Director Boonyong Tansukul. The company will benefit
from a rebound in sales following floods last year, the report

call to his office.  Sub Sri Thai Pcl (SST)  , an operator of warehouses and
restaurants, slid 6.6 percent to 21.30 baht, the largest
decrease since Jan. 19. The company will offer a 5-for-1 stock
