German bonds advanced for a fourth
day as signs that global growth is slowing boosted demand for
the euro area’s safest assets. Greek securities slid on the last
day investors can participate in the nation’s debt swap.  Ten-year German bunds headed for the biggest  weekly gain 
this year as a measure of  China ’s leading indicators slowed and
the nation’s third-biggest bank said profit slid. Italian bonds
were also set for their biggest weekly drop in 2012 as data
showing European manufacturing shrank sapped demand for higher-
yielding assets. Bunds outperformed Treasuries in the five days,
with the 10-year yield  gap  widening to the most in about a year.  “Since the start of the week we have seen quite a
pronounced climate of  risk aversion , which has triggered the
move in bunds,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist
at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “The news from China is not very
constructive for risk assets.”  The yield on the German 10-year bond, the region’s
benchmark government security, fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.87 percent at 4:35 p.m. London time,
leaving the rate 18 basis points lower in the week. The 2
percent security due January 2022 rose 0.385, or 3.85 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,326) face amount, to 101.160. The five-day drop
in the yield was the most since the week ended Dec. 16.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  said net income fell 14
percent in the fourth quarter. A gauge of China’s leading
indicators rose 0.8 percent in February, slowing from a revised
1.5 percent advance in January, the Conference Board said today
in Beijing.  Bunds Outperform  German bonds have returned 11 percent over the past year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds rose
4.5 percent, while Italian securities increased 4.4 percent.  The Italian  10-year yield  fell five basis points to 5.05
percent today, for a weekly increase of 19 basis points, the
most since the 5-day period ending Dec. 23.  Spain ’s 10-year
yield dropped 12 basis points to 5.37 percent, paring its weekly
advance to 18 basis points.  A euro-area  composite index  based on a survey of purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing fell to 48.7 in March
from 49.3 in February, London-based Markit Economics said
yesterday. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Greek Bonds  Investors holding bonds governed by laws other than those
of  Greece  have until 10 p.m. Athens time today to decide whether
to participate in the nation’s plan to obtain a reduction of
more than 50 percent on its obligations to private investors.
The country has already used so-called collective-action clauses
to compel all investors in the nation’s domestic-law debt to
take part in its swap.  The yield on the 2 percent Greek bond maturing in February
2023 climbed to more than 20 percent for the first time since
the nation issued the securities on March 12 as part of its debt
exchange.  The yield climbed 96 basis points to 20.10 percent, with
the price falling to 24.90 percent of face value. The 30-year
yield jumped 137 basis points to 18.02 percent, surging 3.02
percentage points in the past five days, with the price tumbling
to 16.85 cents on the euro.  Bondholders planning to resist Greece’s debt swap are
unlikely to get paid in full, according to  Fidelity Investments 
and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Debt Deadline  “I struggle to imagine a situation where holdouts get paid
at par,” said Nick Eisinger, a sovereign analyst in London at
Fidelity Investments, the second-largest U.S. mutual fund
company. “It’s hard to imagine a scenario in which Greece
capitulates, because of the political message that sends and
also, they just don’t have the money.”  Investors holding bonds governed by laws other than those
of Greece have until 10 p.m. Athens time today to decide whether
to participate in the nation’s plan to obtain a reduction of
more than 50 percent on its obligations to private investors.
Evangelos Venizelos said on March 9, when he was the nation’s
Finance Minister, that sweeteners offered in the debt exchange
wouldn’t be available after today’s deadline.  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold 10-year Treasuries
instead of similar-maturity German bunds increased to the most
in 13 months. The  spread  reached as much as 39 basis points
today, the most since Feb. 21, 2011, based on closing prices.  German  government securities  may keep outperforming their
U.S. peers, UBS AG said, citing trading patterns.  Technical Levels  “A close above 31 basis points, the 50 percent
retracement of the move between March 2010 and November 2011,
opens the way for an extension toward 67 basis points,”  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy at UBS in
London, wrote in a research note today. That level represents
“the January 2010 extreme,” he said.  “Any short-term pullback to 32 basis points should be seen
as an opportunity to position for further bund outperformance,”
Adcock said.  The difference in yield between Italian 10-year bonds and
similar-maturity German bunds widened two basis points to 320
basis points after reaching 334 basis points, the most since
March 7.  The French-German  10-year yield  spread expanded as much as
five basis points to 113 basis points, the most since March 13.
The Belgian-German 10-year gap widened four basis points to 150
basis points.  The Dutch-German spread increased two basis points to 59
basis points after reaching 61 basis points on March 22, the
widest since Nov. 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
