President  Dennis Lockhart  said he doesn’t favor more central
bank asset purchases to stimulate growth with the U.S. economy
picking up.  “We should hold the balance sheet where it is for the time
being and watch how the economy evolves” and “whether the
transmission mechanism for monetary policy becomes more
efficient,” Lockhart said in a talk today at  Georgetown
University  in Washington. “That transmission mechanism isn’t
working as efficiently as it can and therefore I have
reservations about more accommodation.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
