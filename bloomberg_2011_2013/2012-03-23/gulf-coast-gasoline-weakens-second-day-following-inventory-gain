Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened for a
second day after a government report showed inventories of the
fuel rose.  Total gasoline stockpiles in the region increased 1.28
million barrels last week to 75.1 million, the highest level
since December, the Energy Department reported March 21.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  narrowed 0.75 cent to 14.75 cents a gallon versus
April futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:55
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
rose 3.94 cents to $3.239 a gallon.  The same fuel in New York Harbor was unchanged at a 10.5
cent discount.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel was unchanged in New York Harbor at
7.5 cents over Nymex heating oil futures.  CME Group Inc. (CME)  may lower the sulfur requirement in the
existing Nymex heating oil futures starting in May 2013, the
exchange said today. CME said previously it would de-list the
contract after April 2013, with an ultra-low-sulfur diesel
future taking its place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
