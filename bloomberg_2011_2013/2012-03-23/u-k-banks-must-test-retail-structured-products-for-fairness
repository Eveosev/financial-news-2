Firms must stress-test structured
financial products to make sure they are fair before selling
them to retail customers, the U.K.  Financial Services Authority 
said.  Banks should probe their structured products for design
flaws and compare returns for customers against other investment
types, Britain’s financial watchdog said in a report on its
website today. Products should be designed “that meet the
target audience’s needs, rather than merely contributing towards
the firm’s bottom line.”  “While we recognize that they must operate on a
commercially sound basis, firms should strike a balance with
pricing and market pressures to ensure that fair consumer
outcomes are delivered,” the regulator said in the  report .  The FSA has increased pressure on banks to be transparent
in their dealings with retail customers.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  was fined
7.7 million pounds ($12.2 million) in January last year for
failing to disclose risks in two funds it sold to thousands of
retirees. The fine was the biggest imposed by the London-based
regulator for retail rules breaches.  Structured products are fixed-term investments that have a
return rate derived from a separate measure, such as a financial
index or basket of shares.  The financial watchdog, funded by the firms it regulates,
is preparing to be abolished by 2013 and replaced by two
separate regulators to police banks and markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
