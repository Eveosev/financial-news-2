Julius Berger Nigeria Plc (JBERGER) , the
country’s largest construction company by market value, gained
by the limit after posting a 74 percent increase in full-year
profit and declaring a dividend.  Profit for the year through December increased to 4.87
billion naira ($31 million), while revenue fell to 169.41
billion naira from 173.7 billion naira, according to a statement
 Renaissance Capital  received from the  Nigerian Stock Exchange 
today. Company results in Nigeria are usually distributed by the
bourse to brokerages before they are posted on its website. A
spokesman for Julius Berger wasn’t immediately available for
comment.  Julius Berger will pay a dividend of 2.40 naira per share
on June 22, according to the statement.  The stock gained 1.45 naira, or the daily limit of 5
percent, to 30.45 naira by the close in Lagos.  “It makes sense for investors to queue to take positions
on the stock in order to take advantage of the dividend,”
Oluwatosin Ojo, a Lagos-based analyst at Vetiva Capital
Management, said by phone today. “The dividend yield of 9
percent is quite high and rare at this point in the market.”  Julius Berger, whose largest shareholder is Germany’s
 Bilfinger Berger AG (GBF) , forecast a 46 percent increase in first-
quarter profit on Dec. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
