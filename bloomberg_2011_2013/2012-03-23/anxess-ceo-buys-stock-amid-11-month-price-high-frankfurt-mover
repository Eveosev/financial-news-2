Lanxess AG (LXS)  rose to the highest in
almost 11 months in Frankfurt trading as Chief Executive Officer
Axel Heitmann bought stock in the German chemical company
following its forecast of earnings growth this quarter.  Lanxess  rose  as much as 4.5 percent to 63.80 euros, the
highest intraday price since May 4, and was trading up 3.1
percent at 11:12 a.m. The gain comes on top of an 8.5 percent
jump yesterday after Leverkusen-based Lanxess predicted it will
report record first-quarter profit.  Heitmann bought stock yesterday at 60.27 euros a share in a
1.33 million-euro ($1.76 million) transaction, Lanxess said
today in a statement. The CEO is rebuilding a  holding  in the
maker of synthetic rubber after he sold most of his stock for
9.88 million euros in August. The announcement of that disposal
triggered a 5.8 percent drop in Lanxess shares Aug. 26, even
after Lanxess said the sale was for “purely private reasons.”  The CEO now holds about 47,000 shares after buying 5,000
last month and a further 22,000 yesterday, Lanxess said today.  Lanxess has gained 57 percent this year, boosting the
manufacturer’s market value to 5.2 billion euros.  The German chemical maker, spun off from  Bayer AG (BAYN)  in 2005,
said yesterday that earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and one-time items will probably be
as much as 350 million euros in the current quarter, a gain of
8.7 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
