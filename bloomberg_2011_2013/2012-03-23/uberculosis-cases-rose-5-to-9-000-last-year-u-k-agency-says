The number of tuberculosis cases in
the U.K. rose 5 percent to more than 9,000 last year, the  Health
Protection Agency  said.  About 40 percent of the infections were reported in  London ,
and almost 75 percent of the total were people born outside the
U.K., the HPA said today in a statement.  Tuberculosis is staging a comeback in the capital city,
where some neighborhoods suffer infection rates found in African
countries in which the disease is endemic. The number of cases
surged 50 percent in the 10 years to 2009, according to the
agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
