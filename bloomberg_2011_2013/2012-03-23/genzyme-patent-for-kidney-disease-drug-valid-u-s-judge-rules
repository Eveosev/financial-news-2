Genzyme Corp. and Bone Care
International Inc. won a U.S. judge’s ruling that their patent
for the  kidney disease  drug Hectorol is valid and enforceable.  U.S. District Judge Robert M. Dow affirmed the patent’s
validity in a 78-page ruling published yesterday. The companies,
now part of Paris-based Sanofi, filed suit seeking that ruling
in 2008 to prevent U.S.-based drugmakers Pentech Pharmaceuticals
Inc. and its Cobrek Pharmaceuticals Inc. unit from making a
competing generic version.  The case was tried before Dow in Chicago in October and
November 2010.  An injectable drug, Hectorol is used to treat patients with
end-stage kidney disease who are undergoing dialysis and
suffering from hyperactivity in that part of the thyroid gland
that regulates calcium and phosphorus levels.  Closely-held Pentech and Cobrek are based in the  Chicago 
suburb of Rolling Meadows,  Illinois . Citing their non-public
status, an employee of the company who declined identify herself
said the businesses declined to comment on Dow’s ruling.  The case is Bone Care International Inc. v. Pentech
Pharmaceuticals Inc., 08cv1083, U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
