Blond, petite and pretty, Martha
Dodd was the daughter of the American ambassador to  Germany 
during the rise of the Nazis. One of Hitler’s aides thought
she’d make a good girlfriend for the Fuhrer.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Ernst Hanfstaengl, head of Germany’s foreign press bureau
in Berlin, set up the date. They went for tea at Hitler’s
favorite hotel, the Kaiserhof, where, surrounded by bodyguards,
the Fuhrer sat down at a table nearby.  When Martha was summoned for her meeting, Hitler rose and
kissed her hand, murmuring something in German, which she failed
to catch. She was captivated by his “startling and
unforgettable” eyes, which she recalled were “pale blue in
color” and “intense, unwavering, hypnotic.”  After she returned to her table, Hitler sent “curious,
embarrassed stares” in her direction, but nothing more came of
the encounter. Shrugging off any lingering disappointment,
Martha had affairs with lots of Nazis, including Gestapo chief
Rudolf Diels.  I spoke with Andrew Nagorski, author of “Hitlerland:
American Eyewitnesses to the Nazi Rise to Power,” on the
following topics:  1. Americans in Germany  2. Excitement of Berlin  3. Early Alarms  4. Journalist Coverage  5. Red Flag Warnings  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
