Banif SGPS SA (BNF) , a Portuguese lender,
is likely to resort to a portion of aid set aside by the
government for non-state banks, Jornal de Negocios reported,
citing the bank’s chief executive officer, Jorge Tome.  Banif will have to bolster its capital, and it’s natural
that the bank resort to the state’s capitalization line in that
process, Tome said, according to the Portuguese newspaper.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
