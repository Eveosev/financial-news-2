Peru ’s central bank raised its
forecast for economic growth this year to 5.7 percent as a
stronger global economy boosts the outlook for investment and
exports in the third biggest copper-producing nation.  Exports will rise 5.1 percent to a record $48.7 billion,
boosting the outlook for the $176 billion economy, the bank said
in its quarterly inflation report issued in Lima today. The bank
previously saw growth of 5.5 percent and exports little changed.  The central bank maintained its key  interest rate  at 4.25
percent for a 10th month on March 8 after exports climbed 35
percent in January and business confidence rose to a one-year
high in February. Confidence is rising after Europe’s debt
crisis eased and growth in the  U.S. economy  picked up, the
bank’s President Julio Velarde told reporters in Lima today.  “January saw a recovery in GDP and domestic demand remains
very strong,” Velarde said. “There’s increasing confidence
among economic agents.”  The country’s annual  inflation  rate will probably return to
the central bank’s 1 percent to 3 percent target range in the
second half, after reaching a two-year high of 4.74 percent in
December, Velarde said.  “Apart from  oil prices , we don’t see significant supply
shocks,” Velarde said. “We don’t see significant pressures
from demand. At 5.7 percent growth still remains below
potential.”  The central bank left its estimate for 2013 growth
unchanged at 6.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
