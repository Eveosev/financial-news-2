Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
and  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  are among seven companies in the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index that might cut their dividends next week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BBVA,  Spain ’s largest bank, will probably reduce its
dividend to shareholders by 19 percent to 12 euro cents,
according to Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts that factor in
earnings and options prices. Telecom Italia,  Italy ’s biggest
phone company, may lower its interim payout by 25 percent to
43.5 euro cents.  Companies in the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  may raise shareholder payouts by
11 percent in the next 12 months, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Per-share earnings are forecast to grow
34 percent in that period.  Celesio AG (CLS1) , the German drug retailer, may cut its dividend
by 16 percent to 42 euro cents, while  Neopost SA (NEO) , a supplier of
mailroom equipment, may reduce its payout by 2.2 percent to 2.20
euros.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS) ,  Raiffeisen Bank
International AG (RBI)  and  Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl (PMI)  may all say
that they won’t pay out any dividends.  Salzgitter AG (SZG) , the German steelmaker, may increase its
dividend by 81 percent to 58 euro cents, while  Wolseley Plc (WOS) , the
world’s largest supplier of heating and plumbing products, may
raise its dividend by 23 percent to 18.5 pence. Vienna Insurance
Group AG and  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)  may also pay higher dividends
next week.  The  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  has dropped 2.7 percent so far this week as a
Chinese manufacturing index indicated a worse contraction this
month and euro-area services and manufacturing output shrank
more than economists had forecast. The gauge fell 0.2 percent to
265.09 at 3:54 p.m. in  London  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
