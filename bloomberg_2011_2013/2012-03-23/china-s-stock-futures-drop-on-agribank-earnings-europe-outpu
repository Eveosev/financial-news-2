China’s stocks  fell, capping the
benchmark index’s biggest weekly loss in three months, after a
gauge of leading Chinese economic indicators rose at a slower
pace and the third-biggest Chinese bank reported lower profit.  China United Network Communications Ltd. (600050) , which controls
the nation’s second-largest cell phone operator, lost 1.3
percent after the company reported profit that trailed analyst
estimates. Agricultural  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  fell 0.4 percent
after the lender posted its first quarterly profit drop in two
years. Developers  China  Vanke Co. and Poly Real Estate Group Co.
slid at least 1.3 percent after the Economic Information Daily
said the nation may expand property tax trials.  “The prospect of negative earnings in the first quarter
hasn’t been priced in yet,” said Wang Weijun, an analyst at
Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 26.23 points, or 1.1

U.S.-listed Chinese companies, retreated 0.8 percent in  New York

steepest weekly drop since the period ended Dec. 16, after
reports showed profits for state-owned companies dropped in the
first two months of this year and manufacturing may contract in
March. A leading index for China rose at a slower pace in
February, with the gauge gaining 0.8 percent from the previous
month to 227.2, the Conference Board said, citing a preliminary
reading. That compares with a 1.5 percent gain in January.  Europe Economy  This week’s losses for the  Shanghai  index pared 2012 gains
to 6.8 percent. Stocks in the index trade at 9.7 times estimated
profit, compared with a record low of 8.9 times on Jan. 6,

percent in 2010 and 2011 combined.  Thirty-day  volatility  on the Shanghai Composite was at
15.3, a four-day high. About 10.9 billion shares changed hands

yesterday, or 16 percent lower than the daily average this year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A gauge of European manufacturing fell to 47.7 as factory
output unexpectedly shrank in Germany and  France , according to
London-based Markit Economics. Europe is China’s biggest export
market, making up about 18 percent of the nation’s overseas
shipments, according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  Earnings Miss  Vice Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said today the nation is
facing greater pressure to stabilize export growth as
“uncertainties” in the world economy increase. The European
debt crisis will be difficult to resolve in the short term,
Zhong said at briefing in Beijing.  AgriBank (601288)  fell 0.4 percent to 2.64 yuan after the bank
unexpectedly said its quarterly profit dropped for the first
time since listing two years ago due to lending restrictions and
higher bad-loan costs.  Net income declined 14 percent to 21.2 billion yuan ($3.4
billion) for the fourth quarter, according to data compiled by

yesterday. That fell short of the 28.84 billion-yuan average
estimate of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the nation’s
biggest lender, fell 0.9 percent to 4.30 yuan. Bank of China
Ltd., the fourth largest, lost 1 percent to 2.95 yuan.  China United slid 1.3 percent to 4.48 yuan after saying

billion yuan.  Property Taxes  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (CHU) , the nation’s second-largest
mobile phone company and a unit of China United, will boost
 capital spending  30 percent this year, Chief Executive Officer

under pressure” in 2012 as the company faces higher marketing
and network costs.  Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property developer, fell
1.3 percent to 8.12 yuan. Poly Real Estate, the second biggest,
declined 1.4 percent to 10.60 yuan. China Merchants Property

and Shanghai in starting property tax trials, the Economic

 Finance Ministry ’s research institute for fiscal science, and
Wang Haibin, an analyst at Shenzhen World Union Properties
Consultancy Co. Property tax trials should be widened to target
existing home owners, it said.  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) , China’s biggest producer of baijiu
liquor by market value, rose 3.3 percent to 212.02 yuan, its
highest close since Dec. 2. Net income increased 73 percent last
year, the liquor maker said yesterday.  Kweichow Moutai may raise product prices by about 30
