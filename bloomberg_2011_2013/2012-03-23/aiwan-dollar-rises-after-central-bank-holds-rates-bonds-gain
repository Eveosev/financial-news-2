Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened,
poised to snap a two-week loss, after the central bank kept
 interest rates  unchanged and signaled the economy will rebound
next quarter.  Government bonds  rose.  Governor Perng Fai-nan announced yesterday he would leave
the  discount rate  on 10-day loans at 1.875 percent and focus on
inflation rather than boosting growth in 2012. A government
report today may show factory output increased 8.9 percent last
month from a year earlier, after contracting more than 16
percent in January, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “What’s happening now is growth isn’t as bad as before and
the focus now is inflation,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist
at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “We might expect a
stronger currency as a result.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent today and during
the week to NT$29.543 against its U.S. counterpart as of 9:41
a.m. local time, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings that
traders use to price options, rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 4.55 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 fell one basis point today and during the five-day period
to 1.285 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. It
reached 1.30 percent on March 15, the highest level for a
benchmark 10-year note since Jan. 6, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The overnight  money-market  rate slipped one basis point to
0.392 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
