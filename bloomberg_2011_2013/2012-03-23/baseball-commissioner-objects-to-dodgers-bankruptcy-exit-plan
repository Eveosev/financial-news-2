Major League Baseball  objected to
the Los Angeles Dodgers proposed bankruptcy-exit plan, saying it
contradicts a settlement the team reached with baseball
officials last year.  The objection is “limited” and doesn’t mean Baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig is reneging on his promise to help the
Dodgers win court approval for its reorganization plan, which is
required before the team can exit bankruptcy, MLB officials said
in the objection, filed today in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware.  The reorganization plan contains minor flaws that should be
corrected, including a provision that appears to “release
numerous persons (including Dodgers’ players, coaches and
personnel, etc.) from violations of MLB rules and regulations,”
MLB said in court papers.  Such broad legal releases also violate court precedent, MLB
said.  Owner  Frank McCourt  agreed to sell the Dodgers after months
of legal battles with Major League Baseball and  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox
Sports. That sale would be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Kevin Gross as part of the reorganization plan.  The team said in a court filing last year it may sell for
more than $1 billion. The sale is required to be completed by
the end of April.  Dodgers spokesman Robert Siegfried didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail requesting comment on the objection.  The case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-12010,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
