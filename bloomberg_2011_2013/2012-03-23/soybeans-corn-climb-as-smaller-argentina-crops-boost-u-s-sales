Soybeans and corn rebounded from
one-week lows on speculation that declining production in
 Argentina  will boost demand for U.S. exports.  Soybean output in Argentina, the world’s largest shipper of
cooking oil and animal feed made from the oilseed, will fall to
44 million metric tons this year, down from 49 million collected
in 2011 and 46.5 million estimated by the U.S. government this
month, the Agriculture Ministry said yesterday. The corn harvest
may fall to 21 million from 22.5 million last year.  “Smaller crops in Argentina mean global supplies are
getting tight, and that could boost overseas purchases from the
U.S.,”  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in Minneapolis, said in a telephone interview.  Soybean futures for May delivery advanced 1.2 percent to
close at $13.6575 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, after prices yesterday touched $13.385, the lowest since
March 13. Still, the oilseed fell 0.6 percent this week,
snapping five straight weekly gains.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 0.3 percent to $6.465 a
bushel in Chicago, trimming this week’s loss to 3.9 percent, the
most in 10 weeks.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
