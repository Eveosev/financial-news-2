The  New York Giants  re-signed  David Carr  to back up Super Bowl-winning quarterback  Eli Manning .  Carr, 31, who didn’t throw a pass during the 2011 regular
season, said he wanted to stay with the Giants because of his
familiarity with the offensive system and the culture in the
locker room. Terms of his agreement weren’t released.  “It’s a great environment,” Carr said on the team’s
website. “Guys keep you humble. They keep it loose. No one
takes themselves too seriously, and with all the egos and all
the good football players, you’d think that would be a problem.
But there’s really not that issue in this locker room.”  Carr was the first choice by the expansion Houston Texans
in the 2002 National Football League draft. He played five
seasons in Houston and one with the  Carolina Panthers  before
joining the Giants.  As Manning’s backup, Carr played in three games in 2008 and
six in 2009, completing 33 of 42 passes for 340 yards, three
touchdowns and no interceptions. After a season with the  San
Francisco 49ers , he returned to the Giants.  In his 10-year career, Carr has completed 1,351 of 2,264
passes for 14,433 yards, 65 touchdowns and 71 interceptions. He
has been sacked 266 times, including an NFL record 76 as a
rookie in 2002.  “It’s just natural for me,” Carr said of the Giants’
offense. “I feel really comfortable in it. I know that if given
the opportunity and put in the position to play on this team, I
would do well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
