Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the world’s largest
maker of wireless phone networks, set a new mid-term sales-
growth target that’s 2 percentage points lower than the current
range as telecommunications companies limit spending.  The company has a target of 2 percent to 8 percent compound
annual sales growth through 2014 compared with 2011, Stockholm-
based Ericsson said in the executive-stock plan published in the
agenda for its May 3 annual shareholders meeting. Last year’s
 target  was 4 percent to 10 percent growth through 2013.  Ericsson’s revenue  increased  12 percent last year to 227
billion kronor ($33.6 billion), buoyed by mobile operators’
broadband investments to cope with the exploding number of
smartphone users. This year’s growth may slow to 4 percent,
according to the average of 32  analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Operators will hold back on spending in the short
term, Chief Executive Officer  Hans Vestberg   said  in January.  “Last year, growth was strong so it is probably
unreasonable to expect the company to maintain its three-year
growth target,” said Mats Nystroem, a Stockholm-based analyst
at SEB Enskilda. “This year is more challenging, and we can’t
rule out that the future beyond 2012 could also be slightly
negative.”  Ericsson  declined  1.8 percent to 66.35 kronor as of 3:11
p.m. in  Stockholm . The company retained a target of 5 percent to
15 percent growth in operating profit and a plan for cash
conversion of at least 70 percent annually.  Equipment Market Contracts  The market for radio base stations and related equipment
contracted 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 after growing
in the first nine months to produce a 15 percent expansion rate
for the year, said Stefan Pongratz, an analyst at Dell’Oro
Group.  “While there are signs that  operators  in various regions
slowed down investments, the product mix played a significant
role in the fourth quarter,” Pongratz said by e-mail.  North American carriers spent less on older mobile
broadband networks using the CDMA standard as they shifted to
newer so-called fourth-generation networks, Ericsson said in
January.  Ericsson’s share of radio equipment increased to 37.9
percent from 33.5 percent in 2010, Pongratz said. Huawei
Technologies Co. was the second-largest vendor with a 20.8
percent market share, followed by Nokia Siemens Networks at 19.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
