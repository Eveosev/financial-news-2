Mondi Group (MNP) , Europe’s largest maker
of office paper, cut Chief Executive Officer David Hathorn’s pay
by 4.1 percent last year as his bonus was reduced, even as
profit rose and the dividend increased.  Hathorn, 49, earned 1.77 million pounds ($2.81 million) in
2011, which included base pay of 800,000 pounds, a bonus of
468,480 pounds and deferred stock valued at the same amount,
Johannesburg-based Mondi said in an e-mail. That compares with a
total package in 2010 of 1.85 million pounds, which included
salary of 775,000 pounds and a bonus and deferred shares each
worth 517,313 pounds. Hathorn is paid in the U.K. currency.  Mondi employees’ average pay increase in  Europe  was 4
percent, with a 7 percent raise in  South Africa , the company
said in its  annual report  posted yesterday. Underlying operating
profit in 2011 rose 36 percent to 622 million euros ($823
million) and net debt fell 39 percent to 831 million euros.
Mondi plans to increase the dividend 30 percent to
26 euro cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
