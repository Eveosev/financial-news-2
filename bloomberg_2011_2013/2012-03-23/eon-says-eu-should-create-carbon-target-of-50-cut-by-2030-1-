The European Union should adopt a
target to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030,
rescuing the region’s carbon market, said  EON AG. (EOAN)   Without reform, the market will stagnate, Johannes Teyssen,
chairman of the utility’s management board, said today in a
briefing with reporters in Berlin.  “The emissions-trading system in Europe is a ‘dead man
walking’, the system is mortally ill,” Teyssen said today.  He said he’s started canvassing  Guenther Oettinger , the EU
energy commissioner, to consider the greenhouse gas target.  Poland on March 9 blocked a move by other nations to detail
the region’s climate-protection plans after 2020. The EU
parliament voted for a set-aside of an unspecified volume of
carbon allowances, which may temporarily support prices by
eroding an oversupply through this year and beyond.  A 2030 target would encourage companies to invest in CO2-
reducing power stations and factories, Teyssen said. This would
avoid “cannibalizing and destroying” the market and “infuse
strength and life” into it. The EU should also adopt a floor
price for allowances that would be adjusted annually, rather
like the  European Central Bank  sets  interest rates .  Alternatively, a tax could be introduced on CO2 emissions.
Teyssen said he has “relatively wide support” from the  BDI , a
lobby group for German industries.  The idea of a new 2030
target would smooth emissions reductions between now and 2050,
he said. Current rules would encourage cuts mainly after 2020.  ‘No Sharp Rise’  EON’s plan would not lead to a sharp rise in the cost of
carbon, depending where lawmakers set the floor price or tax, he
said.  EU carbon permits have dropped 61 percent in the past year
and were up 1 percent today at 6.94 euros ($9.18) a metric ton
on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London as of 11:25 a.m.  Emissions from factories and power stations in the program
were probably 1.963 billion metric tons last year, an increase
of 1.3 percent from the level in 2010,  Mark Lewis , an analyst in
Paris with  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , said March 19. Emissions data from
the EU program for last year is expected on April 2.  In the power sector alone, generation from natural gas
dropped 13 percent for the year to 459 terawatt-hours, while
hard coal jumped 8.7 percent, according to the bank. Total
fossil fuel-based production decreased 3.6 percent and total
generation including non-fossil sources declined 3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
