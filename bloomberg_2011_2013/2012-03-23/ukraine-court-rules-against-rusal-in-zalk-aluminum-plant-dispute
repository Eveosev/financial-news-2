Ukraine’s government won a court
hearing as it seeks to regain control over the  Zaporizhskyi
aluminum smelter  from Russian billionaire  Oleg Deripaska ’s
United Co. Rusal.  The Kiev Commercial Court ruled to overturn a sale
agreement and return a 68.01 percent stake in the plant, known
as Zalk, to Ukraine’s state property fund, the Prosecutor
General’s Office, also based in the country’s capital, said
today in a  statement  on its website.  The prosecutors filed the suit, saying Rusal refused to
refinance the plant’s $75.5 million of debt, “violating the
state’s property rights,” according to the statement.  Rusal, the world’s biggest producer of the light metal,
said it has fulfilled all of its obligations as investor.  “The court’s decision has not taken effect yet, and the
company will challenge the decision in upper courts,” Rusal
said in an e-mailed statement. “Zalk currently generates losses
now because of the unprecedented high price for electricity.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
