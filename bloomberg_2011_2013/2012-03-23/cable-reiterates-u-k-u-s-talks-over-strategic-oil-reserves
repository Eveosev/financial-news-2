Business Secretary  Vince Cable 
reiterated that Britain had been in talks with the U.S. and
other nations about a coordinated release of strategic oil
reserves to bring down prices.  “The government has a stockpile of oil for emergencies,”
Cable told a conference of businesspeople in Scarborough,
northern England, in answer to a question from a delegate.
“There have been moves in the last few weeks, which are
coordinated with the Americans and others, to release some of
that stuff into the market to keep prices down.”  Prime Minister  David Cameron  said March 15, the day after
he discussed the matter with U.S. President  Barack Obama , that
the two of them had reached no decision.  The strategic reserve was last tapped in July and August
2011 under an International Energy Agency effort to ease
shortages in supplies from the  Middle East .  Releasing oil from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve has
been no guarantee of lower prices at the pump over the last
eight years. In four instances, gasoline rose following the
announcements of supplies from emergency inventories. In 2008
and 2011, tapping stockpiles brought down the cost of a fill-up,
according to data from AAA.  Brent crude oil has climbed 16 percent this year to trade
at $124.96 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
