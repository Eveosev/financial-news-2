An imam and his guard were killed
in an explosion in the southern Russian republic of Dagestan,
RIA Novosti reported, citing the local Investigative Committee.  The explosion occurred in the city of Buinaksk at about
6:00 a.m. local time, and an investigation is under way to
determine the cause, the news service reported.  Russia sent a temporary detachment of about 1,000 troops to
help combat terrorism in Dagestan, where about 100 members of
the insurgency remain active, Magomed Baachilov, the secretary
of the regionâ€™s security council, said March 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
