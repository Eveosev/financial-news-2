Louisville coach Rick Pitino
maintained his perfect record in the Round of 16 in college
basketball’s national men’s tournament as the Cardinals upset
top-seeded Michigan State to reach the West Regional final.  Louisville was one of two Big East conference teams to
reach the National Collegiate Athletic Association final eight,
along with Syracuse. Ohio State and  Florida  also advanced last
night to regional finals.  Gorgui Dieng had seven blocked shots as Louisville won 57-
44 to make the Spartans the first regional top seed to lose in
this year’s tournament. Dieng, a sophomore center from  Senegal ,
also had three steals in leading a Louisville defense that held
the Spartans to 29 percent shooting.  “Tell me where they are, I’ll go over there,” said
Pitino, whose 10-0 record in Round of 16 games includes one
coaching win at Providence, five at Kentucky and four at
Louisville. “I don’t care. Congo, Senegal, wherever it is, I’ll
go.”  Fourth-seeded Louisville (29-9) will face No. 7 Florida
(26-10) in the West Regional final tomorrow. Syracuse (34-2),
the top seed in the East Regional, will play No. 2 Ohio State
(30-7) in that regional’s final tomorrow.  Kentucky  (34-2), the top seed in the entire tournament,
plays its regional semifinal game tonight against  Indiana  (27-8)
in the South Regional in Atlanta. The Wildcats lost earlier this
season to the fourth-seeded Hoosiers.  Baylor Versus Xavier  No. 3 Baylor faces No. 10 Xavier in another South Regional
semifinal tonight in Atlanta, while top-seeded North Carolina
plays No. 13 Ohio and No. 2  Kansas  takes on 11th-seeded North
Carolina State in Midwest Regional semifinals in  St. Louis .  Louisville, which won the Big East conference tournament,
got 15 points and nine rebounds from Chane Behanan in its win
against the Spartans (29-8), whose Draymond Green had 13 points
and 16 rebounds in the game at the  US Airways (LCC)  Center in Phoenix.  Bradley Beal had 21 points to lead Florida to a 68-58 win
in Phoenix against Marquette (27-8), which was trying to become
the third Big East school of the night to advance.  In the East Regional, Syracuse overcame 14 3-pointers by
 Wisconsin  to hold on for a 64-63 victory against the No. 4
Badgers at the TD Garden in  Boston . C.J. Fair scored 15 points
and Scoop Jardine had 14 to lead the Orange.  Jordan Taylor, who had 17 points, six assists and four
rebounds for Wisconsin (26-10), missed a long 3-pointer in the
closing seconds. Jared Berggren also scored 17 points for
Wisconsin, which went 14-for-27 on 3-pointers.  ‘Best Games’  “This is one of the best games I’ve been involved with in
a long time, I think the best game anybody has ever played
against us and didn’t beat us,” Syracuse coach  Jim Boeheim  said
in a news conference. “I don’t think anybody has ever made 14
threes against us and we beat them.”  Ohio State used a 17-1 second-half run to defeat sixth-
seeded Cincinnati (26-11) in Boston. Jared Sullinger had 23
points and 11 rebounds for the Buckeyes, and Deshaun Thomas
contributed 26 points.  Cashmere Wright had 18 points for the Bearcats, who trailed
37-25 before opening the second half with a 27-11 run to take a
four-point lead -- only to have the Buckeyes respond with their
decisive 17-1 run.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
