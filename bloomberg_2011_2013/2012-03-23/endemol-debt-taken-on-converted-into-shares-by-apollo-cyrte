(Corrects name of Apollo, starting in first paragraph of
story published on March 23.)  Apollo Global Management and Cyrte
Fund II BV agreed to take on the majority of  Endemol NV (EML)  debt
held by other creditors and become the Dutch TV producer’s
biggest shareholders as they’ll convert the loans into shares.  Endemol shareholders  Mediaset SpA (MS)  and  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  will continue to be “small participants,” Eric Bosman, a
spokesman for Cyrte shareholder  Delta Lloyd NV (DL) , confirmed Cyrte
Managing Director Frank Botman as saying in an interview with
Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad today.  Endemol, which produces the “Big Brother” TV shows, said
in January a majority representing more than two-thirds of its
lenders had agreed “in principle” on restructuring about 2
billion euros ($2.7 billion) in debt. Charlie Gardner, an
Endemol spokesman, didn’t immediately return a phone call
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
