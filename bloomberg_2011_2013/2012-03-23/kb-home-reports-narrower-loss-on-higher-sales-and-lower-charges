KB Home (KBH) , the Los Angeles-based
homebuilder that targets first-time buyers, reported a narrower
first-quarter loss on higher sales and lower impairments.  The net loss for the three months ended Feb. 29 shrank to
$45.8 million, or 59 cents a share, from $114.5 million, or
$1.49, a year earlier, the company said today in a statement.
Analysts expected a loss of 23 cents a share, the average of 17
 estimates  in a Bloomberg survey. The year-earlier results
included a $53.7 million impairment and a loss on a loan
guaranty of $22.8 million, both related to the company’s
investment in a project near  Las Vegas .  While KB Home shares have  soared  this year as the housing
market shows signs of life, the company is struggling to reach
profitability in part because it is saddled with debt, according
to Megan McGrath, an analyst with MKM Partners LP in Greenwich,
 Connecticut . KB Home climbed 67 percent this year through
yesterday, the best performance in the Standard and Poor’s 1500
Homebuilding  Index. (S15HOME)   “Investors are expecting a company that has made this much
of a run to have made more progress toward profitability,”
McGrath, who has a sell rating on KB Home, said by telephone
before the results were announced.  Optimism among homebuilders has been improving in recent
months. A National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
measure of confidence held in March at the highest level since
June 2007 as sales expectations climbed. Housing starts fell 1.1
percent in February from a three-year high while building
 permits  increased to a 717,000 annual pace, the most since
October 2008, Commerce Department figures showed March 20.  KB Home’s orders fell 8 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier to 1,197 homes. Revenue increased 29 percent to
$254.6 million. The company delivered 1,150 homes, up 21 percent
from the first quarter of 2011.  The results were announced before the start of regular U.S.
trading. KB Home fell 7 cents to $11.24 yesterday in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
