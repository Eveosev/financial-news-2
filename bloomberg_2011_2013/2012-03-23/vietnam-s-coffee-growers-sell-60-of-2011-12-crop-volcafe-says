Coffee growers in  Vietnam , the
world’s largest producer of robusta beans, sold about 60 percent
of the current season’s crop, according to Volcafe, a unit of
commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  The country’s harvest will rise to a record 22.1 million
bags of coffee in the 2011-12 season begun in October from 20
million bags in the prior period, the trader estimated last
month. Vietnamese farmers have held back beans as they wait for
better prices after robusta slid 14 percent last year in London
trading on NYSE Liffe.  The premium paid by buyers of Vietnamese coffee to NYSE
Liffe prices was unchanged from last week at $10 a metric ton
for beans for April and May shipment, Volcafe said in a weekly
report to clients e-mailed today. Bean offers for nearby
shipment are “plentiful in volume,” it said, while those for
forward months are “difficult to get” and demand for the
period “goes unsatisfied.”  “Freight-rate increases make delivery to the board
unattractive,” Winterthur, Switzerland-based Volcafe said,
referring to bean shipments to NYSE Liffe.  Hauling coffee to ports in northern  Europe  from  Ho Chi Minh
City , Vietnam, cost about $1,600 to $1,650 for every 20-foot
container in January, according to A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, the
world’s biggest container-ship owner. That compares with the
rate of $1,250 cited by the company in August.  In  Indonesia , the third-biggest robusta grower, local
prices remain “expensive” and offers for the 2012-13 crop
starting in April are “hard to find,” Volcafe said.  The premium for Indonesian coffee to NYSE Liffe prices rose
to $120 a ton from $100 last week for beans for April and May
shipment, figures from the trader show.  Robusta for May delivery climbed 0.6 percent to $2,020 a
ton by 1:46 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . Prices are up 12
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
