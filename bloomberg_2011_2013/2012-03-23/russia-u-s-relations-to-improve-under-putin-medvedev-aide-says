Russia’s relations with the U.S.
will “improve further” under Prime Minister and President-
elect  Vladimir Putin , said  Sergei Prikhodko , outgoing President
Dmitry Medvedev’s foreign policy aide.  Improving the relationship is in Russia’s national
interest, Prikhodko told reporters today in Moscow.  Putin, who won a six-year term in the Kremlin in the March
4 election, served as president between 2000 and 2008 and was
succeeded by Medvedev. The Russian leaders have said they intend
to swap places after Putin’s inauguration in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
