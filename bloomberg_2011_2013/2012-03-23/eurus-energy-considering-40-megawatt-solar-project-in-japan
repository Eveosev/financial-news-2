Eurus Energy Holdings Corp. (TOPZ) , a
Japanese developer of renewable energy projects, is considering
building a solar power plant with as much as 40 megawatts of
capacity in western  Japan .  The company and land owners have agreed to study the
possibility of building the plant in Awaji city, Hyogo
prefecture, they said in a joint  statement  yesterday. If built,
the plant will start operating by March 2014 and plans to sell
all of its electricity to Kansai Electric Power Co., according
to the statement.  Japan wants to diversify its energy mix following the
earthquake and tsunami that crippled Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station last year. The country is
encouraging renewable energy investment by planning to pay
preferential rates for projects.  Construction of the plant may be subject to government
implementing the feed-in tariff program, which is due to start
in July, according to the statement. The government hasn’t
announced the rates as a state-appointed panel is still
deliberating the prices.  The Awaji plant will be the first domestic solar power
plant developed by Eurus, a venture between  Toyota Tsusho Corp. (8015) 
and Tokyo Electric. It operates wind farms in and outside Japan
with a total capacity of more than 2 gigawatts, according to the
statement.  The company also has about 50 megawatts of solar  power
plants  in  South Korea  and the U.S.  Softbank Corp. (9984)  said on March 8 its clean energy unit and
Mitsui & Co. may build a 30-megawatt solar power plant in
Tottori prefecture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
