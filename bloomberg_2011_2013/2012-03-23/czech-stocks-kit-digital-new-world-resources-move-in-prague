The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell for a fourth day, extending its third week of losses. The
benchmark slid 0.2 percent to 988 at the close in Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, slid 0.1 percent to 129.9 koruna, after earlier
tumbling as much as 1.5 percent. Today’s decline extended the
stock’s losses to 4.7 percent this week and 18 percent in March.
