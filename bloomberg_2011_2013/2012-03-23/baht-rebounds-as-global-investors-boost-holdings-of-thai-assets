Thailand ’s baht rebounded from a
one-week low as international investors raised holdings of the
nation’s assets on optimism growth in Southeast Asia’s second-
largest economy will improve this year.  Global investors poured a net $834 million into local
equities this month through yesterday, stock exchange data show.
The central bank raised its forecast for gross domestic product
to grow 5.7 percent this year from 4.9 percent previously, and
increased its estimate for average  core inflation  to 2.4
percent, Assistant Governor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan said on
March 21.  “I am quite positive on the baht in the weeks ahead given
that growth can do better due to flood rebuilding, domestic
demand can be strong, and as the Bank of Thailand stopped
easing,” said Nizam Idris, a currency strategist in Singapore
at Macquarie Group Ltd.  The baht advanced 0.1 percent to 30.79 per dollar as of
14:28 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency slipped 0.1 percent this week and touched 30.86
earlier, the weakest level since March 15. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 6.525 percent. The central bank kept
the benchmark interest  rate  unchanged at 3 percent this week,
pausing after two reductions.  Thailand’s government would like to see lower  interest
rates  and a weaker currency to help exporters cope with higher
energy costs, Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said
yesterday. A range for the baht of between 32 and 34 would “be
very good,” he told Bloomberg Television in  Hong Kong .  Oil prices  have held above $100 a barrel since mid-February
and have climbed more than 7 percent this year to trade at
$105.86 in  New York .  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.62
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the week,
the rate rose one basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
