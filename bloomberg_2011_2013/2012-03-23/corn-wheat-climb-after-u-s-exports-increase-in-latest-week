Soybeans gained on expectations
growers in the U.S., the second-biggest shipper, will plant more
corn at the expense of the oilseed and as dry weather in  Brazil 
harms crops.  Corn seeding may rise 3.1 percent this year to 94.8 million
acres while the soybean area may gain 2.3 percent to 76.7
million acres, according to a survey of farmers and industry
officials by Chicago-based Linn Group Inc. Dry weather in
southern Brazil is still affecting soybeans and corn, forecaster
Somar Meteorologia said on March 19.  U.S. corn “planting will actually be closer to 95 million
acres, and that’s going to come at the expense of soybeans,”
said  Sudakshina Unnikrishnan , a London-based analyst at  Barclays
Capital . “And we have the South American drought that’s
impacting production. With soybeans, the basic upward trend is
still in place.”  Soybeans for May delivery advanced 1.3 percent to $13.6675
a bushel by 10:27 a.m. London time on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the biggest advance since March 15. The price has dropped
0.5 percent this week.  Corn and wheat rose after data from the U.S., the biggest
shipper of both grains, showed an increase in export sales.  Corn for May delivery gained 1 percent to $6.5075 a bushel
in Chicago. Futures are poised for a 3.3 percent decline this
week, the biggest drop since the five days ended Jan. 13.  Wheat climbed 0.6 percent to $6.5025 a bushel, trimming the
weekly loss to 3.2 percent. Milling wheat for May delivery on
NYSE Liffe in Paris rose 1.1 percent to 212.50 euros ($281.67) a
metric ton, the second straight increase.  ‘Encouraging’ Data  U.S. exporters sold 862,143 tons of old-crop corn in the
week ended March 15, up 3.1 percent from a week earlier, the
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Total net sales of
wheat rose 55 percent to 541,309 tons, the report showed.  “The export data out of the USDA last night was
encouraging for wheat and corn prices,”  Luke Mathews , a
commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , said by
phone from Sydney today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
