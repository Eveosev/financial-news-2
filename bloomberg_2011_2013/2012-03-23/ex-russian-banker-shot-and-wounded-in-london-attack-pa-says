German Gorbuntsov, a former Russian
banker, is hospitalized in  London  after being shot several
times, according to U.K. newswire Press Association.  A Metropolitan Police spokesman, when contacted about the
incident, referred to a March 21 police statement about an
attempted murder inquiry following a shooting near  Canary Wharf 
in east London.  The suspected gunman is white, six-feet tall, slim and was
wearing dark clothes, according to that statement. The incident
it referred to occurred March 20.  “Detectives from the Trident Gang Crime Command are
investigating and are treating the shooting as attempted
murder,” the release said.  The victim’s condition is described as critical but stable.
The shooting isn’t thought to be gang related, the police
statement said.  The banker is under armed guard in hospital while officers
from the force’s Specialist Crime Directorate, which tackles
serious and organized crime, made contact with counterparts
overseas, according to PA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
