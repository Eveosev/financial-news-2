Ethanol snapped its longest streak
of losses since December on speculation that producers will
temper output for spring maintenance.  Output last week at 893,000 barrels was near the lowest
level since October, an Energy Department said March 21.
 Production (DOETFETH)  last year from the period between March 18 and April
15 tumbled 6.2 percent.  “There’s the concern that spring maintenance will bring
down production a little bit more,” said Jerrod Kitt, an
analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “People actually data-mine
that type of stuff. On the other side you have this gigantic,
burdensome inventory that prevents the market from rallying.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery rose 0.9 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.292 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have increased 4 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  increased 2.5
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.36 a gallon and in  Chicago  the
additive was unchanged at $2.275, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $2.325 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel increased 2
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.405.  Production (DOETFETH)  rose to 893,000 barrels a day last week from
892,000, the Energy Department said.  Supply (DOESFETH)  climbed 3 percent to
a record 22.7 million barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
