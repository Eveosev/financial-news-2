Copper climbed, trimming a weekly
loss, after a fall yesterday to the lowest level in more than
two weeks was seen as excessive as global stockpiles declined to
the lowest level in more than three years.  Three-month copper rose as much as 1.1 percent to $8,383.75
a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange and traded at
$8,380.50 by 4 p.m. in Tokyo. The metal has dropped 1.5 percent
this week and touched $8,262.50 yesterday, the lowest level
since March 7, after reports showed manufacturing shrank in
Europe and  China , the world’s largest copper user.  “Copper sentiment is a little poor at present, as markets
and traders have over-reacted to Chinese economic news this
week,” said  Gavin Wendt , founder and senior resource analyst at
Mine Life Pty in Sydney. “There are serious supply side issues
and demand remains robust, despite the pessimism in speculative
circles.”  Copper inventories monitored by the LME fell 1.1 percent to
255,450 tons, the lowest level since November 2008, exchange
figures show. The metal in London has risen 10 percent this
year.  The number of Americans saying the  U.S. economy  is getting
better rose in March to the highest level since 2004 as a
decline in claims for  unemployment benefits  offered more
evidence of a labor-market recovery. Thirty-four percent of
respondents to Bloomberg’s monthly consumer expectations survey
said the economy was improving. Figures from the Labor
Department showed jobless  claims  decreased by 5,000 to 348,000
in the week ended March 17, the fewest since February 2008.  China Manufacturing  The LME  index  of the six industrial metals fell 2 percent
yesterday, the most since March 6, after a preliminary Chinese
purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics dropped to 48.1 from a final 49.6 in February. Euro-
region manufacturing and services output also shrank, a separate
Markit report showed. Readings below 50 signal contraction.  The Comex May-delivery contract was up 0.9 percent at $3.80
a pound. The metal for delivery in June on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed 0.5 percent to close at 60,030 yuan ($9,525) a
ton.  On the LME, aluminum rose 0.6 percent to $2,180 a ton,
gaining for the first time in four days. Zinc advanced 1.5
percent to $2,015 a ton, paring a weekly loss to 3 percent.  Lead was up 1.3 percent at $2,008 a ton after yesterday
touching $1,979.25, the lowest price since Jan. 11. The metal
has dropped 4.7 percent this week, falling for the fourth
straight week. That was the longest losing streak since the week
ended Sept. 23. Nickel climbed 0.4 percent to $18,520 a ton and
tin advanced 1.5 percent to $22,450 a ton.  To contact the reporter for this story:
