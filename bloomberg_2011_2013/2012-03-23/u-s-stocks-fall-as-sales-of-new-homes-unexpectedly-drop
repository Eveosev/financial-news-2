U.S. stocks fell as purchases of
new homes in the U.S. unexpectedly fell in February, a sign the
recovery in the housing market may be uneven.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent to
1,390.67 at 10:03 a.m. in  New York . The benchmark index is
poised for its biggest weekly drop of the year.  New-home sales fell 1.6 percent to a 313,000 annual pace,
the slowest since October, from a 318,000 rate in January that
was weaker than previously reported, figures from the Commerce
Department showed today in Washington. The median estimate of 78
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for 325,000.  U.S. stocks retreated yesterday as manufacturing contracted
in China and Europe and FedEx Corp. tumbled amid a disappointing
forecast. The  S&P 500  slumped 1.2 percent in the past three
days. The gauge is still headed for its longest monthly rally
since September 2009 as economic data topped forecasts and the
 European Central Bank  disbursed more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3
trillion) to lenders.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
