Austrian tennis player Daniel
Koellerer’s life ban for attempted match-fixing was upheld by
sport’s highest court, although his $100,000 fine was set aside.  The player, once ranked no. 55 in the world, was banned and
fined in May 2011 for making “invitations to other tennis
players to fix matches on five occasions between Oct. 24, 2009
and July 3, 2010,” the Court of Arbitration for Sport said
today in an e-mailed statement. He appealed in June.  “The CAS panel confirmed the life ban, acknowledging that
the sanction was sufficiently high enough to reflect the
seriousness of the corruption offences, but set aside the
decision of the anti-corruption hearing officer with respect to
the imposition of a fine of $100,000, considering, in
particular, that the player did not benefit financially from any
of the charges for which he has been found liable,” CAS said in
the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
