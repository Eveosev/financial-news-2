The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission may consider changes to futures industry reporting by
summer to improve investor protection following the collapse of
MF Global Holdings Ltd., Commissioner  Bart Chilton  said.  It is “very realistic” that the CFTC could vote by early
summer on changes to reporting requirements for futures brokers
recommended by the  National Futures Association , an industry
self-regulatory organization, Chilton said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview.  The NFA proposal would require a principal of a futures
broker to approve any transfer of customer funds not made for
the customer and those that exceed 25 percent of the firm’s
excess segregated or secured funds. The proposal would also
require more frequent spot checks of futures brokers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
