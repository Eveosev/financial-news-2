Junk-debt investors looking to
boost returns without buying lower-rated bonds should consider
moving into loans ranked in the highest speculative-grade tier,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  Relative yields for bonds with junk ratings of BB are 56
basis points, or 0.56 percentage point, more than for loans with
equivalent ratings, a gap that’s about half the average since
July 2009, Credit Suisse analysts Jonathan Blau, Daniel Sweeney
and Karen Friedlander wrote in a report today.  When relative yields have moved that close together in
previous periods, loans generated greater returns in the next
three months, suggesting “a switch into BB loans is likely to
result in outperformance,” the analysts said.  “Since July 2009, there has been a fairly consistent
relationship between the relative yields of BB bonds and loans
and the subsequent differential in their performance,” they
said.  Bonds rated in the BB tier are yielding an average 5.41
percent, 23 basis points more than a record low of 5.18 percent
on March 1, the analysts said. Junk debt is rated less than Baa3
by Moody’s Investors Service and below BBB- by  Standard &
Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
