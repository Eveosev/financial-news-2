Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state-run company known as Taqa, said crude oil that spilled
from its Tern platform in waters off Scotland on March 20 has
dispersed naturally.  The spill was the result of a temporary upset in production
while cleaning a new well and there was no risk to the crew or
the platform, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Taqa Bratani Ltd., the subsidiary that owns and operates
the Tern platform, didn’t say how much oil was spilled. The  BBC 
reported earlier today that 23 metric tons was discharged.  The Tern field feeds into the Brent System Pipeline which
carries crude to Sullom Voe in the Shetland Islands, according
to Taqa’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
