European (SXXP)  stocks closed little
changed, after the biggest weekly selloff this year, as a
rebound in automakers and mining companies offset an unexpected
drop in U.S. housing data.  Renault SA (RNO)  and Antofagasta Plc rallied at least 2 percent
after both tumbled more than 3 percent yesterday.  BT Group Plc (BT/A) 
climbed after the U.K.’s largest fixed-line phone company said
it will cut its pension deficit by half.  Randgold (RRS)  Resources Ltd.
and  Publicis Groupe SA (PUB)  paced declining shares.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  rose 0.1 percent to 265.65 at
the close in London, paring this week’s retreat to 2.5 percent,
the biggest drop since December. The gauge has still advanced 
8.6 percent  in 2012 as the  European (SXXP)  Central Bank disbursed more
than 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) to the region’s lenders.  “We’ve seen some disappointing data this week, so the
market is a bit on edge,” said John Plassard, director at Louis
Capital Markets SA in Geneva. “The U.S. home sales report was
below expectations, which has some investors questioning the
strength of the U.S. economy’s recovery.”  National benchmark indexes rose in 13 of 18 western-
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 rose 0.1 percent, the U.K.’s
FTSE 100 and  Germany ’s DAX both rose 0.2 percent. The number of
shares changing hands on the  Stoxx 600 (SXXPVOLC)  was 7.7 percent lower
today than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  U.S. Home Sales  A U.S. Commerce Department report today showed  purchases  of
new houses unexpectedly fell in February for a second month.
Sales dropped 1.6 percent to a 313,000 annual pace, the slowest
since October, compared to 318,000 in January. The median
estimate of 78 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
325,000.  Renault rallied 2.5 percent to 40.30 euros today, leading a
gauge of companies in the  auto industry  1.4 percent higher. PSA
Peugeot Citroen SA increased 2.3 percent to 12.89 euros and
Volkswagen SA increased 1.7 percent to 132.35 euros.  Mining companies also advanced as copper rebounded in
 London . Antofagasta rallied 2.7 percent to 1,172 pence, the
first increase in four days. Kazakhmys Plc advanced 2.5 percent
to 935.5 pence and Rio Tinto Group gained 1.5 percent to 3,382.5
pence.  BT Group rallied 5.4 percent to 232.1 pence, its highest
price since May 2008, after the company said it will pay down
about half of its 4.1 billion-pound ($6.5 billion) deficit in
its pension fund before the end of this month. That allows the
company to consider a higher  dividend .  “Dividend upside has been a long-standing driver of our
positive view on BT,” Jefferies Group Inc. analyst Jerry Dellis
said in a note. “Incremental positive is that upgrades may now
be communicated in May, six months earlier than expected.”  CGGVeritas, Mobistar  Elsewhere, CGGVeritas, the world’s largest seismic surveyor
of  oil fields , climbed 4.7 percent to 22.70 euros after JPMorgan

Suisse Group AG upgraded  Belgium ’s second-biggest mobile-phone
company to neutral from underperform.  Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW)  gained 4 percent to 1.45 euros after
 Italy ’s largest renewable energy company forecast earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to rise to
2.6 billion euros by 2016, up from 1.4 billion euros in 2011.  Randgold, Publicis  Randgold paced declining shares, falling 2 percent to 5,650
pence after Citigroup Inc. downgraded the gold producer to
neutral, the equivalent of a hold rating, from buy. Randgold

coup in  Mali , where the it mines two-thirds of its gold.  Publicis dropped 2.7 percent to 41.17 euros. Nomura
