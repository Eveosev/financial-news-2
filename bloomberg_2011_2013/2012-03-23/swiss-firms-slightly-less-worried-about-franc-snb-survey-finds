Swiss companies are getting
slightly less worried about the Swiss franc’s strength as the
 exchange-rate  cap eased uncertainty and simplified planning, the
Swiss central bank said.  “The exchange rate situation was no longer given the same
prominence” in the first quarter as in the previous three
months, the  Swiss National Bank  said in its  quarterly bulletin 
published today, citing a survey. “However, some manufacturing
companies and service providers still regard the current
exchange rate level as critical.”  The SNB last week maintained its cap of 1.20 francs per
euro introduced in September to fight deflation risks and help
exporters. While consumer prices fell for a fifth month from a
year earlier in February, exports unexpectedly gained 9.2
percent the same month, adding to signs the economy is
stabilizing.  “The minimum exchange rate for the Swiss franc against the
euro brought welcome planning security for many companies and
even prevented some from going out of business,” the  SNB  said.
“Pressure to optimize costs is continuing.”  The survey was conducted in January and February among 243
Swiss companies, according to the SNB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
