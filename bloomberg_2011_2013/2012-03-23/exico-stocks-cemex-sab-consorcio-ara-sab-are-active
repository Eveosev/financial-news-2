unusual price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 8:44 a.m. local time.  The IPC index rose 0.2 percent to 38,404.31.  Construction-related companies led declines among Mexican
stocks as sales of new homes unexpectedly dropped in the U.S.,
Mexicoâ€™s top export market. New home sales fell 1.6 percent to a

rate in January that was weaker than previously reported,
figures from the Commerce Department showed today in  Washington .
The median estimate of 78 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a pace of 325,000.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  , the largest cement maker in the

, a Mexican homebuilder, fell 0.2 percent to 4.33
