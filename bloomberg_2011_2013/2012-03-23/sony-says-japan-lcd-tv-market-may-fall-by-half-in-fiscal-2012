Sony Corp. (6758)  said industrywide sales
of liquid-crystal-display televisions in  Japan  may fall by half
in the year starting April 1, after the nation’s transition to
digital broadcasting boosted demand the previous year.  Demand may decline to 8 million units, Kenji Honda, head of
home entertainment products at Sony’s domestic marketing unit,
told reporters in  Tokyo  today. He declined to say what share of
the market Sony aims to win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
