Renewable Energy Corp ASA (REC) , the
Norwegian maker of polysilicon, rose the most in more than a
week in Oslo trading after Chinese producers cut output.  REC rose as much as 7.3 percent, the most since March 15,
and was up 4.3 percent at 3.568 kroner as of 10:53 a.m. in the
Norwegian capital.  About 80 percent of Chinese polysilicon companies halted
production due to slowing demand and declining prices, according
to a statement on the National Development and Reform Commission
website today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
