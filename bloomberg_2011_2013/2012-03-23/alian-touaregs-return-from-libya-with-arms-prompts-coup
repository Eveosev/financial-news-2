An ethnic Touareg uprising in  Mali ,
driven by armed fighters returning from Libya, prompted soldiers
to overthrow the government that tasked them with quashing the
rebellion.  The Azawad National Liberation Movement began a revolt in
January, opening fire on military targets in northwest  Africa 
where al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has attacked troops and
kidnapped foreigners in recent years. Before its ouster
yesterday, Mali’s government accused the Touareg group, known by
its French acronym MNLA, of working with al-Qaeda and regional
drug traffickers.  Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes, moving
to other areas of Mali and to neighboring countries including
 Burkina Faso , Mauritania and Niger to escape the violence
between the MNLA and the army and in fear of reprisal attacks,
according to the International Red Cross. Their plight is
worsening a food-security crisis that threatens 15 million
people in seven countries, according to the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization.  “Unlike previous rebellions, the current Touareg uprising
has been difficult to put down because of the influx of weapons
and war-hardened fighters from  Libya ,” Robert Borthwick, senior
analyst at Bath, U.K.-based risk-analysis group Maplecroft, said
in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. “The soldiers
clearly feel that improved military planning and spending is
necessary to prevent the Touareg rebellion further escalating
and taking the lives of more of their colleagues.”  ‘Incompetent’ Regime  The mutinous soldiers, who announced they were seizing
power on state-owned television, began firing shots earlier in
the day as they were due to meet with the country’s defense
minister about the northern uprising. They blocked roads leading
to the presidential palace and took over the country’s airport
and broadcaster.  “Facing our duty to safeguard the constitution, we decided
to take our responsibilities in ending the incompetent regime”
of President Amadou Toure, said Lieutenant Amadou Konare, a
spokesman for the soldiers, on state television early yesterday.
The constitution had been suspended, he said.  Mali vies with Tanzania to be Africa’s third-biggest gold
producer. Companies including  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the
world’s third-largest producer of the metal, and  Randgold
Resources Ltd. (RRS) , have operations in the country. Randgold’s
shares closed 13 percent lower at 5,765 pence in  London 
yesterday. Chief Executive Officer  Mark Bristow  said the
company’s mines are unaffected. Mali produced about 44 metric
tons of gold in 2011.  Camel Herders  The Taoudeni basin, where the MNLA is seeking autonomy, is
thought to contain reserves of crude oil, according to Lassana
Guindo, the national director of geology and mining. Petroplus
Africa Ltd. and  Simba Energy Inc. (SMB)  are among the companies that
have signed deals to search for crude in Mali. The basin has 25
oil blocks, with 13 under exploration, Guindo said on March 13.  Traditionally nomadic camel herders, Touaregs have staged
similar battles for autonomy in Mali and neighboring Niger in
the five decades since the countries became independent from
colonial ruler  France . The current uprising is bolstered by
Touaregs who returned from Libya after the October death of
leader  Muammar Qaddafi , according to the UN.  ‘Precarious Security’  The Libyan crisis has “exacerbated an already precarious
security situation in the Sahel region,” UN Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon said in a Jan. 18 report to the Security Council,
referring to the area south of the  Sahara desert . Weapons and
ammunition from Libyan stockpiles, including anti-aircraft
artillery and explosives, were smuggled into Mali, Niger and
Burkina Faso, according to the report.  Some of the estimated 2,000 Touareg rebels who have
returned from Libya had been high-ranking officers in the Libyan
army, Lynn Pascoe, UN under-secretary for political affairs,
told reporters yesterday in  New York . By joining forces with the
rebellion in Mali, they “added much more firepower and drive to
this operation,” Pascoe said.  Mali was due to hold a presidential election on April 29,
with Toure set to step down after serving two terms in office.
The leader had vowed to quash the Touareg rebellion before next
month’s vote.  The MNLA denied that it has any connection with al-Qaeda’s
northwest African unit, according to its website. AQIM has taken
responsibility for a rise in kidnappings in the vast region,
including attacks in  Algeria , Niger and Mauritania.  Family Ties  “According to some reports, there are family ties between
some members of the Touareg rebellion and those involved in al-
Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,” said Benjamin Soares, a Mali
expert who lectures at the African Studies Centre in Leiden, the
Netherlands. He said estimates have put AQIM membership at just
300. “Most involved in AQIM are probably from Algeria but some
are said to have married locally into Malian families,” he
said.  The coup was condemned by the Economic Community of West
African States and the  African Union , which a day earlier held a
Peace and  Security Council  meeting on the issue in Bamako and
called for a cessation of fighting.  The fighting has “aggravated an already precarious
situation, created a humanitarian crisis, including the
displacement of populations within Mali and to neighboring
countries, and undermined development efforts,” the council
said in the March 20 statement.  ‘Food Crisis’  In parts of landlocked Mali, especially in the north, as
much as 70 percent of the population is facing “acute food
insecurity” with a lack of drinking water and  animal feed , said
Souleymane Sana, assistant country director for  Oxfam Novib , by
phone from Bamako yesterday. “The food crisis has been
exacerbated by the growing insecurity in the region, first with
kidnappings by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and now by the
Touareg uprising.”  Oxfam Novib’s program to distribute staple foods including
sorghum and cooking oil has been suspended and staff have been
told to stay at home, Sana said.  Mali’s “dependence on international donors and foreign
investors will create pressure for polls to be held relatively
rapidly,” said Maplecroft’s Borthwick. “If the coup leaders
are able to secure effective power, they would be likely to
increase military spending to combat the heavily armed Touareg
rebels.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
