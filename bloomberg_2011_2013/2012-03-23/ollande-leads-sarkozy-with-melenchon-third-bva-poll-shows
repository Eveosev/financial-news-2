Socialist Francois Hollande would
beat President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in both rounds of the French
presidential election, according to a BVA poll which puts
leftist candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon in third place.  The survey, published in Quest  France  and Le Parisien
newspapers today, showed Hollande with 29.5 percent in the first
round and Sarkozy garnering 28 percent. Melenchon would get 14
percent of first-round votes, pulling ahead of Marine Le Pen
with 13 percent and centrist  Francois Bayrou  on 12 percent.  In second-round voting, Hollande would beat Sarkozy by 54
percent against 46 percent. The poll, which was carried out
yesterday and the day before, found that Sarkozy is judged to be
more credible on security issues than Hollande and as credible
on immigration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
