While others pack themselves into
“The Steins Collect” with its abundance of Matisses and
Picassos, take yourself into the softly glowing splendor of
“Byzantium and Islam: Age of Transition.”  On view are around 300 objects, ranging from small gold
coins to mosaics and seductive finery.  Muslims, Christians, Jews and all manner of religious
subgroups mingled along the trade routes, attesting to the
diversity that once did not mean killing each other off with
great enthusiasm.  Runs through July 8 at the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art, 1000
Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-535-7710;
 http://www.metmuseum.org .  Saturday Matinee  American baritone great Thomas Hampson sings Macbeth in a
revival of Adrian Noble’s spellbinding production.  Nadja Michael appears as his pushy wife and Dimitri Pittas
shows off his clarion tenor as Macduff.  The matinee starts at 1 p.m. and will be broadcast from the
 Metropolitan Opera .  Runs through April 9 at  Lincoln Center . Information: +1-
212-362-6000;  http://www.metoperafamily.org .  On the lighter side, adorable boys sing, dance and take on
corporate sharks in “Newsies: The Musical.”  The show, like the 1992 Disney film, is based on the 1899
New York City newsboy strike in which street urchins thwarted
price-gouging publishers.  Jeremy Jordan stars as the handsome runaway Jack, with Kara
Lindsay as his love interest.  “Newsies” has a snappy book by Harvey Fierstein, music by
Alan Menken and athletic choreography by  Christopher Gattelli .  In previews at Nederlander Theatre, 208 W. 41st St. for a
March 29 opening. Information: +1-866-870-2717;

at John Jay College, a few blocks south of Lincoln Center.
That’s where the homeless New York City Opera has landed this
weekend, having abandoned the David H. Koch Theater.  The staging is by the usually piquant Christopher Alden,
with sets by Andrew Lieberman that evoke Central Park, also
nearby. A smart-looking cast sings Mozart’s great tunes.  At 524 W. 59th St. Information: +1-212-870-5600;
 http://www.nycopera.com .  Sunday  See Francesca Woodman’s evocative photographs of young
women, including herself.  In one image, there’s a crumbling interior, with flowery
wallpaper partially obscuring a naked female form: The viewer’s
eye is transfixed by the bellybutton.  Some of Woodman’s figures are nude, some move in a blur and
some are barely present, yet all create a powerful impression.  Yet she killed herself in 1981 when she was 22.  Runs through June 13 at the Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth
Ave. Information: +1-212-423-3618;  http://www.guggenheim.org .  Sunday Matinee  Sitting unproductively in his office, a young man discovers
a paperback copy of “The Great Gatsby” and starts reading.  Soon the brunette by the file cabinet comes into focus as
the privileged Daisy Buchanan. The burly man with his keys
jangling on his belt loop is her husband, Tom.  You’ll be transported back to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1920s
in this Elevator Repair Service production of “Gatz.”  It takes six and a half hours for the cast of 13 to read
the book.  Runs through May 13 at the  Public Theater , 425 Lafayette
St. Information: +1-212-967-7555;  http://www.publictheater.org .  Luckily, there’s a dinner break, so head to Chinatown
Brasserie for shrimp dumplings, seared filet mignon and warm
custard-filled buns.  At 380 Lafayette St. Information: +1-212-533-7000.  Sunday Afternoon  Grab the chance to hear Murray Perahia play Bach, Beethoven
and Chopin, as part of the Great Performers Series at  Avery
Fisher Hall .  Perahia’s formidable technique may come partly from his
early studies with Vladimir Horowitz.  Born in the Bronx, Perahia is now a resident of  London , and
he doesn’t return to his old haunts all that often.  At Lincoln Center. Information: +1-212-875-5030;
