Emerging-market stock funds took in
$782 million in the week ended March 21 for a 12th consecutive
week of inflows and the longest run of gains since 2010,
according to EPFR Global.  Net investment into developing-nation  equity  funds has
totaled $25.72 billion in 2012, compared with outflows of $24.46
billion for the same period of 2011, according to a report e-
mailed today by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data
provider.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
recorded net inflows for the week of $1.02 billion, EPFR said.
Asian funds excluding  Japan  recorded a net outflow of $157
million,  Cameron Brandt , EPFR director of research, said by e-
mail today.  The streak of consecutive weekly inflows to emerging stock
funds was the longest since a 29-week run of gains ended in
December 2010.  Dedicated BRIC nation funds recorded a total outflow of $22
million for the week, the first back-to-back weekly redemption
for the fund group since January. Dedicated Russia funds saw an
inflow of $131 million.  Russia equity funds posted an inflow of $131 million, the
eighth consecutive week of fresh money, while Latin American
funds recorded an outflow of $119 million, largest redemptions
this year.  The average emerging-market equity portfolio posted a 1.8
percent loss for the week, cutting the 2012 advance to 14
percent, Brandt said.  Emerging-market bond funds registered inflows of $851
million to bring the 2012 total to $13.84 billion, the best
start to a year on record, EPFR said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
