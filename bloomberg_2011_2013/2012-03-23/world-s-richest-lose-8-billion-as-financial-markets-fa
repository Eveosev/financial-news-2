a combined $8 billion this week as markets fell on concerns that
the global economic rebound was slowing.  Mukesh Ambani’s fortune fell $1.4 billion, dropping his net

concerns that  China’s economy  continues to slow,”  Mike Werner ,
a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said in
a March 22 e-mail. “China’s industrial activity disappointed

loans emerging at the Chinese banks.”  Global markets fell on news that manufacturing in Europe
and China contracted and sales of new U.S. homes fell in
February. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 3 percent during the

shares of his Hong Kong-based  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1) , which
makes up more than half of his fortune, declined 7.23 percent
during the week. The billionaire, 83, has a net worth of $24.3
billion, making him the world’s 14th richest person.  Europe, Brazil  European retail magnate  Bernard Arnault  lost almost $2
billion after shares of his  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) ,
the world’s largest luxury-goods company, fell 5.2 percent in
Paris trading this week. Arnault, 63, ranks fifth on the index
with a net worth of $42.3 billion.  Brazil’s  Eike Batista , 55, whose commodity empire includes
a majority stake in OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, saw his
fortune decrease 4.6 percent to $26.8 billion. OGX, Brazil’s
second-biggest oil company by market value, fell 4.5 percent
yesterday after reporting lower-than-expected output. Batista’s
fortune is up 19.3 percent, or $4.3 billion, this year.  Sheldon Adelson, chairman and chief executive officer of
casino operator  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , saw his fortune rise $375
million. On March 19, the company said it will open the Sands
Cotai Central casino resort on April 11 in Macau, China. He’s
now the 11th-richest person on the index with a net worth of
$26.3 billion.  Adelson, 78, and his wife Miriam, have donated at least $15
million to Winning Our Future, a super-PAC supporting Republican
presidential candidate Newt Gingrich.  World’s Three Richest  Carlos Slim , the 72-year-old telecommunications tycoon who
controls Mexico’s America Movil SAB, remained the world’s
