U.S. stocks reversed an early drop
as energy companies and oil rallied on a report that sanctions
will reduce Iranian crude exports by 300,000 barrels a day.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,392.77 at 10:53 a.m. in  New York  after tumbling as much as 0.4
percent. Energy companies climbed 0.9 percent as a group and
accounted for most of the market’s advance following the Reuters
report.  Earlier losses were triggered when an unexpected drop in
sales of new U.S. homes fueled concern the global economic
rebound was slowing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
