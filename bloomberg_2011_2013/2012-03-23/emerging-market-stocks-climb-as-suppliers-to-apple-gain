Emerging-market stocks gained for
the first time in seven days, reducing their weekly decline, as
rising oil prices boosted energy producers and outweighed
concern that a slowing Chinese economy may damp global growth.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  advanced 0.1 percent to
1041.96 at the close in New York, led by health care companies.

$106.87 a barrel on the Nymex. It touched $108.25 a barrel, the
highest intraday price since March 2, after Reuters reported

month because of tighter sanctions.  “Commodities have really given a boost to commodity-
intensive stocks markets,”  Neil Shearing , chief emerging-
markets economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in  London , said by
phone. “The issue now is whether the macro data is going to
hold up and continue to improve or whether we’re at a turning
point.”  Emerging-market stocks have gained 14 percent this year,
compared with an 11 percent advance for shares on the  MSCI World

market shares, which trade for 13.1 times analysts’ earnings
estimates.  The  iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index  exchange-traded
fund, the most-traded ETF that tracks developing-nation shares,
jumped 0.8 percent to $42.90. The Chicago Board Options Exchange

to 25.10.  A leading economic index for China rose 0.8 percent in
