  U.K. stocks  rose the most in a
week, as BT Group Plc jumped to its highest price since 2008
after the company said it will pay off half of its pension
deficit and may increase its dividend.  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  surged 9.1 percent after Morgan Stanley
recommended buying the stock.  Regus Plc (RGU)  gained 1.3 percent after
Panmure Gordon & Co. upgraded the shares. Randgold Resources
Ltd. slid 2 percent as Citigroup Inc. downgraded the mining
company following yesterday’s coup in  Mali .  The FTSE 100 advanced 0.2 percent to 5,854.89 at the close
in London, after earlier losing as much as 0.8 percent. The
gauge declined 1.9 percent this week, its biggest retreat since
December. The FTSE 100 has still  added 5.1 percent  this year.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index gained 0.2 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased 0.1 percent.  “Earnings momentum across all U.K. sectors has improved in
recent weeks,” Darren Winder, an equity strategist at Oriel
Securities Ltd. in London, wrote in a report today. “ We expect
equity prices to continue to trend upwards during 2012.”  The volume of shares changing hands on the  FTSE 100 (UKX)  today
was 4.4 percent less than the average over the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. House Sales  In the U.S., a report showed that  new house sales  decreased
last month. Purchases dropped to an annual rate of 313,000 in
February from a revised 318,000 in January. That fell short of
the median estimate of 78 economists in a  Bloomberg News survey 
for a reading of 325,000.  In the U.K.,  consumer confidence  declined last month,
according to a report. An index of sentiment fell to 44 from 47

consumers’ expectations for the economy fell 4 points to 60.  BT (BT/A)  jumped 5.4 percent to 232.1 pence, its highest price
since May 2008. The U.K.’s largest fixed-line operator said it
will pay 2 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) to narrow the deficit
in its  pension plan , enabling it to reduce annual payments to
the final-salary arrangement. BT will reassess its dividend
after making the pension payment, Chief Executive Officer Ian Livingston said.  Essar Energy surged 9.1 percent to 153.8 pence after Morgan
Stanley raised its recommendation on the shares to overweight
from equal weight, meaning that investors should hold more of
the shares than are represented in benchmark indexes.  Regus Plc gained 1.3 percent to 116 pence after Panmure
Gordon raised its recommendation on the shares to buy from hold.  Randgold Retreats  Randgold (RRS)  slipped 2 percent to 5,650 pence as Citigroup cut
its rating on the shares to neutral from buy, saying the “key
damage is to risk perception,” after a coup toppled the
government in Mali, where the company operates three mines.  Cable & Wireless  Worldwide declined 1.3 percent to 37.5
pence. Some Vodafone directors are said to be concerned that a 1
billion pound bid for Cable & Wireless will damage the company’s
reputation, City A.M. reported today. The newspaper did not cite
anyone.  Tawa Plc (TAW)  plunged 10 percent to 40 pence after the company
posted a full-year loss after taxes of $21.6 million, compared
with a profit of $1.8 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
