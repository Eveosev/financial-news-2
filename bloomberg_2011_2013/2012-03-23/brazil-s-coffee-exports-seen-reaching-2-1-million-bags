Coffee exports from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer, may be about 2.1 million bags this
month, almost the same as shipments in January and February,
according to Flavour Coffee.  “The pace of March shipments is about the same pace as
February,” the Rio de Janeiro-based broker said in an e-mailed
report yesterday.  Exports in February totaled 2.14 million bags, while
shipments were 2.06 million bags in January, data from the
country’s coffee export council, known as Cecafe, show. Growers
in Brazil may be still be holding back 15 to 20 percent of the
2011-12 crop,  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
London, said in a report e-mailed on March 20. The 2011-12
season there started in July. A bag of coffee weighs 60
kilograms (132 pounds).  Coffee output in the South American country will likely
rise to a record in the 2012-13 season as trees enter the
higher-yielding half of a two-year cycle, the government
estimates. Production will be 49 million to 52.3 million bags,
exceeding the high of 48.5 million bags in 2002, according to a
Jan. 10 report from Conab, the government’s forecasting agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
