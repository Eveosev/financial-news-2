Morgan Stanley (MS)  bought a portfolio
of loans backed by properties and development projects in London
and Manchester, England, from Ireland’s National Asset
Management Agency for an undisclosed sum.  “We’re pleased to be at the forefront in acquiring loan
portfolios from NAMA and we look forward to generating value for
our investors,” Brian Niles, European head of Morgan Stanley
Real Estate Investing, said in an e-mailed statement.  Morgan Stanley, based in  New York , acquired the loans for
about 65 million pounds ($103 million), or a 70 percent
discount,  Property Week  reported in November. The trade magazine
said that West Properties, the company run by Donal Mulryan,
will continue to manage the real estate for Morgan Stanley.  The Saturn portfolio consists of about 220 million pounds
of loans to  West Properties . The debt was acquired by NAMA,
which was established to purge Ireland’s banks of 74.2 billion
euros ($98.3 billion) of troubled commercial real-estate loans.  Morgan Stanley spokesman  Hugh Fraser  declined to comment
and Mulryan wasn’t immediately available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
