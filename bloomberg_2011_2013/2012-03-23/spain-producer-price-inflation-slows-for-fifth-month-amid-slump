Spanish  producer-price inflation 
slowed for a fifth month in February as the euro area’s fourth-
biggest economy edged toward its second  recession  since 2009.  Prices of goods leaving factories, mines and refineries
rose 3.4 percent from a year earlier, after increasing a revised
3.7 percent in January, the  National Statistics Institute  in
Madrid said today. That matched the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey. Prices rose 0.6 percent from the prior
month.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government, in power since
December, forecasts a 1.7 percent economic contraction this year
as export growth slows and the deepest austerity measures in at
least three decades undermine domestic demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
