Francois Hollande , France’s
Socialist Party presidential candidate, doesn’t have the
“stature of a president” Bernadette Chirac, the wife of the
country’s former leader, said, according to Agence France-
Presse.  “Holland is a very courteous man (…), but that doesn’t
give one the stature of a president,” Chirac, whose husband,
 Jacques Chirac , was France’s president from 1995 to 2002, was
quoted as saying.  “It requires a lot of experience to be president, it
requires long political training, you need to have been a
minister, you need to have many international contacts,” she
said, according to AFP.  Bernadette Chirac, 78, and Hollande are both on the  local
council of Correze , a rural region in central  France  where the
two of them and former President Chirac have built long
political careers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
