Russia â€™s finance ministry proposes
capping budget spending if the oil price from 2013 to 2016 is
lower than certain thresholds, Interfax said, citing ministry
documents.  Spending should be capped if  oil prices  slip below $97 per
barrel in 2013, $95 per barrel in 2014, $92 per barrel in 2015
and $90 per barrel in 2016, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
