The lira strengthened for a third
day after the central bank did not lend at its lowest  interest
rate  for a second day, tightening liquidity to stem the
currency’s weakness.  The lira appreciated 0.4 percent to 1.8012 per dollar at
5:15 p.m. in Istanbul.  Yields (BENCH)  on the two-year benchmark bonds
were unchanged at 9.67 percent after rising to as high as 9.78
percent in intraday trading. On the week, the lira is up 0.4
percent and yields have increased 35 basis points, or 0.35
percentage point.  The central bank withheld funding at the lower end of its
so-called interest rate corridor yesterday for the first time in
more than two months. Instead of the 5.75 percent funding, the
bank lent today 5.55 billion liras ($3.1 billion) in overnight
 repurchase agreements  at 11 percent annual interest. It also
provided 3 billion liras in one-week repo at an average rate of
10.9 percent and 5 billion liras in one-month repo at 10.22
percent.  “The last time the central bank halted lending at the
benchmark interest rate was between Dec. 29 and Jan. 9 and the
Turkish lira gained 3 percent against the euro-dollar basket and
bond yields climbed to 11.4 percent,” Istanbul-based Tera
Brokers said in an e-mailed report to clients today. “The
central bank’s actions would support the lira in the short term,
however equities are poised to witness more profit-taking as
yields rise and global risk appetite diminishes.”  Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100 Stock Index (XU100)  fell for a
fourth day, losing 0.6 percent to 61,417.44, bringing its weekly
decline to 1.5 percent.  Overnight Rate Rises  The  overnight repo  funding rate on the  interbank market ,
the rate at which lenders fund each other for overnight loans,
rose to the highest since Feb. 8 to 9.91 percent.  The central bank will do whatever necessary to reduce
inflation and it will not hurt the banking industry while doing
this, Basci said in a speech at a conference in Istanbul March
21.  “The bank will resort to tightening until inflation is
reduced to the 5 percent target,” the governor said. It will
restrain lending growth and may also adjust its reserve
requirements regime, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
