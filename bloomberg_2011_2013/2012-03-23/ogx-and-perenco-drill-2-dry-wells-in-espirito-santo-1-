OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes
SA , the  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista ,
drilled two dry wells in the deep waters of the Espirito Santo
Basin with its partner Perenco SA.  OGX and Perenco, who operates the five exploration licenses
the two companies have in the basin, plan to drill additional
wells in the area, Chief Executive Officer Paulo Mendonca said
in a conference call today. OXG fell 3.7 percent to 16.36 reais
at 11:06 a.m. in  Sao Paulo  after earlier falling as much as 4
percent, the most since Feb. 10.  “In addition to the two dry wells, we’ve got three-
dimensional seismic that shows a lot of new opportunities,”
Mendonca said today in a conference call with analysts. OGX is
planning to drill at least two wells in the south of the
exploration contract, he said.  OGX started producing its first oil at the Waimea field in
January and will produce 10,000 to 13,000 barrels a day during
the next few months after testing production of as much as
18,000 barrels a day, Mendonca said. OGX plans to connect four
wells to a production platform at the field this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
