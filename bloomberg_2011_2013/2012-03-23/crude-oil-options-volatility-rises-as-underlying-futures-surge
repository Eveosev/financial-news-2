Crude oil options volatility rose
as underlying futures surged as much as 2.8 percent after
Reuters reported that Iranian oil exports would drop 300,000
barrels a day this month.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 25.28 percent as of 2:30 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 25.05 percent in the previous
session.  “The feeling I get is that the market is really nervous,”
said Amrita Sen, a London-based analyst at  Barclays Capital .
“It’s nervous on the crude side because of lack of capacity.”  Crude for May delivery rose $2.90 to touch $108.25 a barrel
at 9:55 a.m., before paring gains. The contract settled $1.52,
or 1.4 percent, higher at $106.87 on Nymex. Futures have gained
8.1 percent this year on concern that tensions with  Iran  over
its nuclear program would reduce global crude supplies.  “The Iran equation is back in and people are concerned,”
said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in
 New York .  Even with today’s spike, crude remained in the trading
range between $103.78 to $110.55 that it has occupied since Feb.
21. Because of the narrow swings, volatility has declined from
30.8 on March 6.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $130 calls, which gained 14 cents to 42 cents a barrel at
2:52 p.m. with 1,968 contracts trading. May $90 puts were the
second-most active options with 1,755 lots changing hands. They
fell 4 cents to 8 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 60 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish options accounted for 54 percent of the 139,894
trades yesterday. May $120 calls were the most actively traded,
with 6,625 lots changing hands as they fell 7 cents to 15 cents
a barrel. The next-most active options, May $100 puts, increased
27 cents to $1.01 on volume of 5,320.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 46,141
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 38,605 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,926.  To contact the reporter on this story:
