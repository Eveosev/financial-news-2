Mexico ’s peso headed to its biggest
weekly decline this year as concern over European growth damped
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 12.8349 per U.S. dollar at
7:53 a.m. in Mexico City, extending its decline this week to 1.3
percent. A close at that level would be the biggest weekly fall
since the period ended Dec. 16. It has strengthened 8.5 percent
this year, the most among major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  While Mexico isn’t dependent on  Europe  for trade, the peso
is weakening as a dimmer economic outlook there damps demand for
emerging-market assets, said  Rafael Camarena , an economist at
Banco Santander SA. European services and manufacturing output
contracted in March, according to an initial estimate from
London-based Markit Economics this week. U.K. consumer
confidence declined in February, according to  Nationwide
Building Society , the customer-owned lender.  “What’s affected the peso this week was a return to the
reality of European economic data,” Camarena said by phone from
Mexico City. “The peso could recover next week.”  The yield on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.49 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.38
centavo to 130.33 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
