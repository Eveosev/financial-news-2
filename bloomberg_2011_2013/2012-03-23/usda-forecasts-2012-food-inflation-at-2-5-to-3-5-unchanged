U.S. consumers will pay 2.5 percent
to 3.5 percent more for food in 2012, the Department of
Agriculture said, holding to a forecast first made in July.  Beef and fish will post the biggest gains of any food
category, each climbing as much as 5 percent this year, the USDA
said today in a  report  on its website. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics this month said expenses fell 0.1 percent in
February. Food costs rose 3.7 percent last year, according to
the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
