MetLife Inc. (MET) , the insurer selling
banking assets to reduce U.S. regulation, plans to start share
buybacks and raise the  dividend  after the  Federal Reserve 
releases the company from its oversight.  MetLife, whose plan to repurchase $2 billion of shares and
increase its dividend 49 percent was rejected by the Fed, is
“committed to returning capital to shareholders,” interim
Chief Financial Officer Eric Steigerwalt said today at an
investor conference hosted by UBS AG. “When we are no longer a
bank holding company, our intention would be to carry out our
capital plan that we submitted to the Fed.”  MetLife is one of four companies to fail the Fed’s
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which was applied to
19 of the largest U.S. financial firms. New York-based MetLife,
which is overseen by the Fed because of its banking operations,
has said the test wasn’t tailored for insurance companies. The
insurer will cease being a  bank holding company  by the end of
the second quarter, MetLife has said.  “We are not a bank,” Steigerwalt said. “We have a small
little bank. We’re getting out of that bank, and we should be
measured along with all of our other peers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
