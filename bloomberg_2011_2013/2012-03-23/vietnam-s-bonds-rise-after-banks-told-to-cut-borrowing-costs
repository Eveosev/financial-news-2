Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose,
pushing the yield to the lowest level in almost 14 months, after
the central bank asked some local lenders to cut borrowing
costs. The dong weakened.  The Joint-Stock Bank for  Foreign Trade  of Vietnam, the
country’s biggest by market value, was among five banks told to
cut operating costs and lower lending rates, according to a
statement posted on the  State Bank  of Vietnam’s website
yesterday.  “The move sent a signal about the central bank’s
determination to bring down borrowing costs under the
government’s request,” said Cao Tan Phat, a Ho Chi Minh City-
based analyst at ACB Securities Inc. “Yields dropped as
investors expect the lending rates will be cut very soon.”  The  yield  on five-year notes fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, today and this week to 11.44 percent as
of 2:34 p.m. in Hanoi, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. That was the lowest level since January
2011.  The dong dropped 0.1 percent today and 0.3 percent this
week to 20,885 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank set the reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
