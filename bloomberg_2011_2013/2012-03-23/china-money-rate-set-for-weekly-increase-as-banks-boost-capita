China ’s money-market rate was set
for its first weekly increase in a month on speculation banks
will boost capital to meet regulatory requirements before the
end of the quarter.  The central bank  drained  a net 19 billion yuan ($3 billion)
from the financial system this week after withdrawing 57 billion
yuan last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
monetary authority has refrained from issuing  one-year  and
three-month bills since Dec. 27 and Dec. 22, respectively.  “Banks are trying to collect more cash to meet deposit and
reserve requirements,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in
Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest
lender. “The seven-day repo may have another small increase
next week.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed eight basis points this week to
2.98 percent as of 10:22 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a
weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It declined 20 basis points today.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose one basis
point in the five-day period to 3.16 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It dropped one basis point today.  The yield on the 3.99 percent government bonds due June
2021 increased six basis points this week, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 3.54 percent, according to the Interbank Funding
Center. The yield fell one basis point today.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Ven Ram, Sandy Hendry  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
