Yields on  Colombia ’s shorter-term
peso bonds rose this week to near a four-month high on
speculation the central bank will raise  interest rates .  The yield on Colombia’s peso bonds due in August 2012
increased 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 5.45
percent this week, according to the central bank. Yields were
down three basis points today in Bogota.  Colombia will raise interest rates for the 10th time in 13
months today to contain inflation after the economy expanded at
the fastest pace since 2007, according to the economists with
the best track record of predicting the central bank’s moves.  “Bonds on the shorter end are anticipating at least one
more interest rate increase,” said Diego Ochoa, head of
research at brokerage Cia. de Profesionales de Bolsa SA. “They
have been pricing in a rate increase over the past three days.”  While 16 of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect policy
makers to hold the benchmark rate at 5.25 percent today, the
three most-accurate forecasters in past surveys all predict
another quarter-point increase.  The peso was little changed at 1,760.27 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,760.45 yesterday. It has gained 10 percent this year, the
biggest advance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
