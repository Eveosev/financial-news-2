Joe Torre  is returning to Major
League Baseball after an unsuccessful bid to buy the Los Angeles
Dodgers.  Torre, who managed the Dodgers from 2008 to 2010, will
become executive vice president for baseball operations, the job
he quit in January to try to purchase the team, according to an
MLB e-mailed release. The 71-year-old Torre managed the  New York
Yankees  to four  World Series  titles before his time in Los
Angeles.  “It was appropriate for him to step away while he looked
into a unique opportunity, and now we are delighted to welcome
him back,” MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement.
“Joe is an accomplished baseball man, a remarkable communicator
and a great asset to our efforts to improve our game.”  Torre joined  Major League Baseball  in February 2011,
overseeing umpiring and on-field discipline, among other things.
A nine-time All-Star as a player, Torre won the World Series
with the Yankees in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000, and is fifth on
baseball’s managerial wins list with 2,326 victories.  He was a part of real-estate developer Rick Caruso’s group
that unsuccessfully bid on the Dodgers. The winning bidder will
likely be selected by April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
