Crude-oil shipments aboard
supertankers bound for  China  rose 4.1 percent this week,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vessels with a total carrying capacity of 18.9 million
deadweight tons are heading for the Asian nation, up from 18.2
million tons last week. About 14 percent of the fleet of the
largest  oil tankers  signaling future destinations is bound for
China, the world’s biggest energy consumer. The ships would haul
about 138.7 million barrels of oil, assuming a conversion factor
of 7.33 barrels a ton.  The following table shows the destinations and combined
carrying capacity in deadweight tons of 434 very large crude
carriers, out of a global fleet of 560, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Average drafts are expressed as a
percentage of maximum sailing depth and are an indication of
cargo size. Each country’s percentage share of total oil
shipments is shown for the current and prior weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
