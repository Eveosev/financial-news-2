Hong Kong  stocks fell, with the
Hang Seng Index posting its biggest weekly drop in four months,
as an unexpected profit decline at  Agricultural Bank of China
Ltd. (601288)  renewed concern growth may slow in the world’s second-
largest economy.  Agricultural Bank,  China ’s third-largest lender, slid 3.1
percent after saying quarterly profit dropped for the first time
since listing two years ago.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a Hong Kong-
based clothier that depends on  Europe  for about 80 percent of
sales, fell 2.3 percent, on worse-than-expected manufacturing
data.  Henderson Land  Development Co. led property companies
lower, dropping 3.2 percent.  “The market is skeptical about bank stocks globally and
for the Chinese bank stocks, you see what happened with”
Agricultural Bank, Jim Antos, a Hong Kong-based financial
analyst at Mizuho Securities Co., said on Bloomberg Television.
“Everybody got it wrong. You couldn’t have predicted it and
that’s the kind of thing that shakes investor confidence,” he
said.  The Hang Seng Index closed 1.1 percent lower at 20,668.80
in Hong Kong and for the week was down 3 percent, its biggest
such drop since November. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
of mainland companies listed in the city slid 1 percent to
10,658.07.  Below Estimates  Agricultural Bank said its quarterly profit dropped because
of lending restrictions and higher bad-loan costs. Net income
declined 14 percent to 21.2 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) for the
fourth quarter, from 24.7 billion yuan, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg based on full-year figures reported by the
Beijing-based lender yesterday. That fell short of the 28.84
billion-yuan average estimate of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. The stock slid 3.1 percent to HK$3.41.  In Europe, a euro-area composite index based on a survey of
purchasing managers in both industries dropped to 48.7 from 49.3
in February, London-based Markit Economics said in an initial
estimate yesterday. Economists forecast a gain to 49.6. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction. That added to pessimism
about the global economic outlook after an earlier index showed
China manufacturing is also shrinking.  Esprit fell 2.3 percent to HK$16.44. AAC Technologies
Holdings Inc., a supplier of speakers and microphones for Apple,
slid 2.9 percent to HK$22.15.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s
largest lender by market value, dropped 1.3 percent to HK$69.10.  China Developers  The cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen may follow Chongqing
and Shanghai in starting property tax trials, the Economic
Information Daily reported today, citing Jia Kang, head of the
 Finance Ministry ’s research institute for fiscal science, and
Wang Haibin, an analyst at Shenzhen World Union Properties
Consultancy Co. Property tax trials should be widened to target
existing home owners, the report said.  Developers in Hong Kong and China fell. Hong Kong-based
Henderson Land dropped 3.2 percent to HK$44.00. Mainland
developer  Agile Property Holdings Ltd. (3383)  slid 0.2 percent to
HK$8.78 and while rival Guangzhou R&F Properties Company Ltd.
fell 0.8 percent to HK$9.06.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  expiring this month declined
1.2 percent to 20,634. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  gained 2.5
percent to 21.02, indicating options traders expect a swing of
about 6 percent in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
