Russia ’s winter grain crop damage
was probably no more than 6 percent after soil tests this month,
compared with more than 6 percent estimated last month,
according to Anna Strashnaya, head of the agricultural forecasts
department at the Federal Hydrometeorological Center in Moscow.  Farmers in six southwestern and southern parts of Russia
will probably have to replant the damaged winter grains at
certain fields, Strashnaya said by phone today. Damage was from
frosts and insufficient snow cover, Strashnaya said.  Four regions in the southwest’s Black Earth and south’s
Krasnador and Stavropol account for about 30 percent of all
Russian grains, according to government estimates.  Winter grains, including wheat, barley, rye and triticale,
made up 35 percent of last year’s plantings that yielded 93.9
million metric tons, according to the state statistics service.
The final crop figure was raised to 94.2 million tons, Dmitry
Bobkov, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman, said by phone today.
This year’s crop is estimated to be equal to last year,  Yelena
Skrynnik , Agriculture Minister, said on March 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
