President  Dennis Lockhart  said the  U.S. economy  is gaining
momentum this year as consumers have become more confident about
the expansion.  “The economy appears to be gaining some traction,”
Lockhart said in a talk at  Georgetown University  in Washington.
“The economy has looked better and better” as more reports
have come in. “The public in general is beginning to get more
confident about the outlook and that translates into more
activity.”  “We would expect growth to come in in the range of 2.5 to
3 percent,” Lockhart said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
