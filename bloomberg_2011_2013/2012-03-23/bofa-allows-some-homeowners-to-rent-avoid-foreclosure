Bank of America Corp. , the second-
largest  U.S. bank , started a program this week to allow mortgage
borrowers facing foreclosure to stay in their homes as renters
while transferring title back to the lender.  The pilot program, dubbed “Mortgage to Lease,” will begin
with fewer than 1,000 borrowers in Arizona,  Nevada  and  New York ,
the bank said today in a statement. Homeowners will transfer
title to the bank and have their mortgage debt forgiven, the
lender said. They’ll then be able to lease the home from the
bank for as many as three years, at or below market rates.  “Our priority is designing a solution that helps our
customer,” Ron Sturzenegger, who oversees the bank’s unit
managing foreclosures and soured loans, said in the statement.
“If this evolves from a pilot into a more broadly based
program, we also see potential benefits from helping to
stabilize housing prices in the surrounding community.”  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  is seeking to
limit additional costs from faulty loans after the 2008 takeover
of Countrywide Financial Corp. helped saddle the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based bank with about $42 billion in expenses.
The bank will own the properties, hire management companies to
oversee them, and after some time sell the homes to investors,
the statement said.  Borrowers in other states won’t be able to volunteer or
apply for consideration in the initial trial program, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
