Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s Mexican unit
is focusing on mortgages and loans to small and medium-sized
businesses as this year’s biggest growth opportunities, Chief
Executive Officer Marcos Martinez said.  Santander is looking to repeat the 20 percent growth in its
total Mexican loan portfolio in 2011, Martinez said in an
interview after participating in a Bloomberg CEO Roundtable
discussion in  Mexico  City today.  Santander’s loans to small and medium-sized businesses
expanded 40 percent during 2011 and are on pace to repeat this
performance in 2012, he said. Mexico’s third-largest bank by
outstanding loans provides about 30 percent of mortgages that
are more than 300,000 pesos ($23,500), he said.  “In these two sectors, the bank and the country have
special interests,” Martinez said. “From the commercial bank’s
point of view, it’s what most strengthens your brand and where
there are the biggest opportunities for growth.”  Santander had about 310 billion pesos in total loans
outstanding as of January, according to data from the National
Banking and Securities Commission. It was second behind the
local units of  Spain ’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in
terms of loans to businesses and homeowners, according to the
commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
