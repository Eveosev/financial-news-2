Asia gasoil refining profits headed
for their first decline in four weeks, and losses from making
 fuel oil  widened. A trading unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. bought
gasoil in Singapore for the first time in two weeks.  Middle Distillates  JP Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. bought 150,000 barrels of
 gasoil  with 0.5 percent sulfur from Hin Leong Trading Pte at a
discount of 25 cents to benchmark prices of the grade, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of traders who monitored transactions
on the Platts window. The cargo was for loading April 18 to
April 22. JP Morgan Ventures previously bought a gasoil cargo on
March 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The gasoil crack, or its premium to Dubai crude, fell 55
cents, or 3.5 percent, to $15.05 a barrel at 6:10 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This  crack spread  is at the lowest since March 7 and has fallen
7.7 percent this week, the biggest weekly decline since Feb. 24.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil was at 20 cents a barrel, down
from 38 cents a week earlier. A narrower  regrade  indicates it is
less profitable to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  ConocoPhillips sold 20,000 metric tons of  380-centistoke (N6SHS380) 
fuel oil for loading April 18 to April 22 to China International
United Petroleum & Chemical Co., the survey showed. The Chinese
trader, also known as Unipec, paid a premium of $1.50 a ton over
benchmark prices of the grade.  Chevron Corp. sold 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke grade
loading April 12 to April 16 to Hin Leong at a premium of $2 a
ton to average prices published by Platts in April.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened to $6.38 a
barrel from $6.17 yesterday. The spread, a measure of losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products, has widened 14
percent this week, retracing some of last week’s gains.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was at $11.25 a ton, widening
from $11 a week earlier, PVM data showed. This means bunker, or
marine fuel, rose less than higher-quality fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $123.19 a ton at 6:17 p.m.  Singapore  time from $120.26
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack
spread has gained 13 percent this week.  Vitol bought 50,000 barrels of  92-RON (MOGFC92S)  gasoline loading
April 7 to April 11 from Gunvor Group Ltd. at $133.60 a barrel.  Refinery News  Cosmo Oil Co. is preparing to start the No. 2 crude-
distillation unit at its refinery in Chiba, according to a
statement on the company’s website today. Production will resume
at the 120,000 barrel-a-day unit after safety approvals by
prefectural officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
