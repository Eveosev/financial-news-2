Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , the world’s
biggest personal-computer maker, authorized a 10 percent
increase in its quarterly dividend, which the company expects to
declare in May.  The current dividend, payable on April 4, will remain at 12
cents a share, the Palo Alto, California-based company said
today in a  regulatory filing . Hewlett-Packard last raised its
dividend in 2011.  The company is working to reverse a slide in its stock
price that has erased more than $35 billion from its market
value over the past year. Under Chief Executive Officer  Meg Whitman , who took the reins in September, Hewlett-Packard is
restructuring the company’s business divisions and investing
more in research and development.  At the company’s annual shareholder meeting earlier this
week, Whitman said Hewlett-Packard has “real financial
challenges.” To streamline operations, she is combining the
personal-computing and printing units into a group led by  Todd Bradley , who ran the PC business.  Hewlett-Packard shares  rose 2.6 percent to $23.63 at the
close today in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
