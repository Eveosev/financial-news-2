Asian  stocks  fell, sending its
benchmark index to its biggest weekly loss this year, as a
surprise drop in profit at  China ’s third-largest bank compounded
concern the global economy is slowing as manufacturing shrinks
from  Europe  to  Asia .  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. , slid 3.1 percent after
posting lower-than-expected earnings and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
Europe’s largest lender by market value, dropped 1.3 percent in
Hong Kong.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which gets about 80 percent of its
revenue overseas, fell 2.9 percent in  Tokyo  after the yen
strengthened.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining
company, lost 1.2 percent in Sydney after metal and oil prices
fell yesterday.  “If you look at the situation rationally, there a lot of
risks still out there,” said Koji Toda, chief fund manager at
Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which oversees the equivalent of $68
billion. “Investors have been looking at the situation in the
U.S. and Europe optimistically and have been buying shares, but
that energy is exhausting itself.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  declined 0.6 percent to 126.08
as of 6:43 p.m. in Tokyo, dropping 1.5 percent for the week. The
gauge rose 11 percent this year through yesterday as the U.S.
showed signs of economic recovery and amid optimism China will
ease its monetary policy. Stocks in the index are valued at 14.9
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.1 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slid 1.1 percent.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.1 percent and South Korea’s
Kospi Index was little changed. Singapore’s  Straits Times Index (FSSTI) 
rose 0.4 percent as a report showed the city-state’s inflation
rate unexpectedly slowed for a third month in February.  U.S. Futures  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.1 percent, while China’s
Shanghai Composite Index declined 1.1 percent amid concern
slowing economic growth is hurting earnings.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.3 percent
today. The gauge lost 0.7 percent in  New York  yesterday as a
report showing manufacturing contracted in Europe added to
pessimism about the global economic outlook after an earlier
index showed China manufacturing is also shrinking.  In Europe, a euro-area composite index based on a survey of
purchasing managers in both industries dropped to 48.7 from 49.3
in February, London-based Markit Economics said in an initial
estimate yesterday. Economists forecast a gain to 49.6. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  HSBC slid 1.3 percent to HK$69.10 in Hong Kong. Esprit
Holdings Ltd., a clothier that gets most of its revenue from
Europe and is aiming to build its market share in China,
declined 2.3 percent to HK$16.44.  Nintendo Co. (7974) , a manufacturer
of game consoles that gets a third of its sales in Europe, slid
2.7 percent to 12,670 yen in  Osaka .  Chinese Manufacturing  In China, a preliminary report yesterday showed
manufacturing in the world’s second-biggest economy may contract
for a fifth month in March. The preliminary 48.1 reading in a
purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc. and Markit
Economics is the lowest since November and compares with a final
49.6 in February.  Agricultural Bank of China slumped 3.1 percent to HK$3.41
in  Hong Kong . Net income declined 14 percent to 21.2 billion
yuan ($3.4 billion) for the fourth quarter, from 24.7 billion
yuan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on full-year
figures reported yesterday. That fell short of the 28.84
billion-yuan average estimate of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  Yen Appreciates  “People already knew Europe’s economy is in a bad shape
and China is slowing down,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general
manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $27.6 billion. “Considering how much Japan has
risen, it wouldn’t be a surprise if we saw some correction given
the slowing in the yen’s weakness and the slowdown in Europe and
China.”  The yen appreciated to as high as 108.49 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 110.44 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 82.33 from 83.39. A stronger yen cuts the value
of overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Automakers Slip  Honda fell 2.9 percent to 3,180 yen in Tokyo, while  Nissan
Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that also gets about 80 percent of its
revenue overseas, lost 2.6 percent to 855 yen.  BHP dropped 1.2 percent to A$34.40 in Sydney. Cnooc Ltd.,

plants in China, declined 4.9 percent to HK$4.29 in Hong Kong.
The stock was cut to “hold” from “outperform” by Daiwa
Securities Capital Markets Ltd. Profits for 2011 were weak and
consensus estimates for 2012 may be reduced, the brokerage’s
analyst Dave Dai wrote in a report.  Among stocks that rose,  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of
clothes and toys to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., jumped 4.2 percent to
HK$19.86 after reporting a bigger-than-expected increase in 2011
profit.  Genting Singapore Plc (GENS) , a casino operator, rose 6.8 percent
to S$1.74 in Singapore after the Casino Regulatory Authority
awarded its first casino junket licenses.  To contact the reporters on this story:
