Canaccord Financial Inc. (CF) , Canada’s
largest non-bank brokerage, said founder  Peter Brown  will step
down as chairman next month.  “As of April 1st, Peter will assume the role of founder
and honorary chairman,” Chief Executive Officer Paul Reynolds
said yesterday in an internal memo. “He will continue to sit on
Canaccord Financial’s board of directors, but in a non-executive
capacity.”  Brown, after turning 70, “decided to focus more of his
time and efforts” on charity and nonprofit work, the memo said.
Brown has worked at Canaccord for 44 years. The change was
earlier reported in the Globe and Mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
