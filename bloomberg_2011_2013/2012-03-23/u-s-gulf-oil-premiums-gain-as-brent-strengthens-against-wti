strengthened as the spread between West Texas Intermediate and
Brent crudes widened.  Brent’s premium over WTI, based on May futures settlement
prices, rose by 47 cents to $18.26 a barrel in  New York . When

U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced against
the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium to WTI widened $1.15 to
$24.25 a barrel over the U.S. benchmark at 2:12 p.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana
Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium gained 80 cents to $23.25 a barrel.  Thunder Horse ’s premium added $1 to $21 a barrel over WTI
and  Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  increased 25 cents to a premium of $16.
Poseidon’s premium added 15 cents to $14.60, while Southern
Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $15.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount was unchanged at $6.25 a barrel
below WTI.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount narrowed $2 to $28 a
barrel. Bakken oil was unchanged at $15.50 a barrel under WTI,
