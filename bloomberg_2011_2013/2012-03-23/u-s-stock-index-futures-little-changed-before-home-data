U.S. stocks rose, trimming the
biggest weekly drop of the year for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, as gains in commodity and energy companies amid rising
oil prices offset an unexpected decline in new-home purchases.  Material and  energy shares  each climbed 1 percent, the most
among 10 groups in the  S&P 500 , as crude rose on a report that
sanctions will reduce Iranian exports.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  gained 1
percent.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  added 3.8 percent, pacing an advance
among financial companies, after it was raised to sector perform
by Royal Bank of  Canada . Bats Global Markets Inc. withdrew its
initial public offering after errors on its own system derailed
trading in the stock and forced a halt in  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   The S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent to 1,397.11 at 4 p.m. in New
York, paring the benchmark index’s decline for the week to 0.5
percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  gained 34.59 points,
or 0.3 percent, to 13,080.73 today.  “Energy’s leading and it’s a reflection of the news out of
 Iran  and concerns about a potential shortage of oil,” Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Milwaukee-based  Robert
W. Baird , which oversees $85 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “The market’s had a big run the first quarter and we
could see some sort of consolidation phase, but I don’t see the
market vulnerable to any significant correction. Despite the big
run in stocks, investor sentiment has been contained.”  U.S. stocks retreated yesterday as manufacturing contracted
in  China  and  Europe  and  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  tumbled amid a disappointing
forecast. The S&P 500 is still up 2.3 percent for March, heading
for its longest monthly rally since September 2009 as economic
data topped forecasts and the  European Central Bank  disbursed
more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) to lenders.  Volume Slump  At the same time,  American equity trading  has struggled.
Shares changing hands on all U.S. exchanges slumped 30 percent
to 5.9 billion today from last week. The average volume in the
past three months has been 6.61 billion, compared with the one-
year average of 7.53 billion.  Raw-material (S5MATR)  and energy companies had the biggest gains out
of 10 groups in the S&P 500 today as commodity prices rose. Oil
surged almost $3 a barrel after Reuters reported Iranian oil
exports will drop by 300,000 barrels a day because of tighter
sanctions.  Alcoa jumped 1 percent to $10.11, while Caterpillar added
1.3 percent to $107.83. Chevron climbed 1 percent to $106.36.
 Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG)  jumped 3.2 percent to $32.52, while  Consol
Energy Inc. (CNX)  jumped 2.5 percent to $33.76.  Financial Stocks  Financial shares advanced 0.9 percent as a group. Morgan
Stanley added 3.8 percent to $20.33. The New York-based firm was
raised to  sector perform  from underperform at Royal Bank of
Canada.  Discover Financial Services (DFS)  climbed 4.1 percent to
$33.83 after the payments network company was raised to
conviction buy at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The S&P Supercomposite  Homebuilding Index (S15HOME)  fell 1.2 percent.
Stocks declined earlier today after figures from the Commerce
Department showed that new-home sales fell 1.6 percent to a
313,000 annual pace, the slowest since October, from a 318,000
rate in January that was weaker than previously reported. The
median estimate of 78 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for 325,000.  KB Home (KBH) , the Los Angeles-based homebuilder that targets
first-time buyers, sank 8.5 percent to $10.29. Revenue in the
first quarter was $254.6 million, falling short of the average
analyst estimate of $328.6 million.  Micron Technology Inc. (MU)  fell 3.6 percent to $8.40 for the
biggest drop in the S&P 500 after reporting a third consecutive
quarterly loss as sluggish demand for personal computers dragged
down chip prices.  ‘Bit of Nervousness’  “There’s a little bit of nervousness this week,” Nick Sargen, chief investment officer at Fort Washington Investment
Advisors in Cincinnati, said in a telephone interview. The firm
oversees $40 billion. “This was the week where the market had a
little bit of second guessing on how strong is Europe, how
strong is China, and that raises the question, ‘How confident
are we that the economy is going to continue to grow at the pace
we’ve seen in recent months?’”  Bats Global Markets withdrew its initial public offering
after the six-year-old equity exchange priced the deal
yesterday.  Pulling the IPO capped a day of missteps for the electronic
exchange, beginning just as the shares were making their debut.
Data received by Bloomberg around 11 a.m. in  New York  showed the
stock, the first ever listed on its Lenexa, Kansas-based market,
quoted at pennies after being priced yesterday at $16.  Around the same time, a transaction in Apple was executed
on Bats so far away from the market price that it triggered a
halt. A single trade for 100 shares executed on a Bats venue
briefly sent Apple down to $542.80, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Bats sent a notice about 10 minutes before the Apple trade
saying it was investigating “system issues” affecting companies
with ticker symbols ranging between A and BF. Apple’s symbol is
AAPL; Bats’s ticker is BATS. Apple finished regular trading down
0.6 percent at $596.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
