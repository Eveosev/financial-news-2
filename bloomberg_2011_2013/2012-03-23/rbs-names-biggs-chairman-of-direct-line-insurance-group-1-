Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
the U.K.’s largest government-owned bank, named Mike Biggs
chairman of its Direct Line Insurance Group Plc unit.  Biggs will keep his role as chairman of  Resolution Ltd. (RSL) ,
the insurance buyout firm, RBS said in a statement today. Andrew
Palmer, who has been serving as interim chairman of Direct Line,
will remain on the board, alongside Jane Hanson, as an
independent non-executive director.  RBS is being forced to divest the insurance unit, which
also includes Churchill and Green Flag, in the second half of
this year to comply with a European Union ruling after receiving
45.5 billion pounds ($72.2 billion) in a taxpayer-funded
bailout. RBS Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  said last
month that an initial public offering in the second half of 2012
was the most likely route for a disposal.  “The successful divestment of Direct Line is one of our
priorities and we have confidence that Mike will help us get
this done,” Hester said in the statement. “The business has
been doing well and is increasingly ready to flourish as an
independent company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
