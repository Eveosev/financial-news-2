Hungarian government bonds fell for
a fourth day, lifting five-year yields to the highest in almost
two months for the European Unionâ€™s most-indebted eastern
member.  The yield on the benchmark domestic security maturing in
November 2017 rose 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to
8.94 percent by 3:40 p.m. in Budapest, the highest level since
Jan. 31. The yield is up 31 basis points this week, the most
since the five days ended Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
