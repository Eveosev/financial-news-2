South Korea ’s won dropped to a two-
month low as reports spurred concern the global economic
recovery is losing steam, sapping demand for riskier assets.
 Government bonds  declined.  Euro-area services and manufacturing output shrank more
than economists forecast in March, while a preliminary survey
signaled China’s manufacturing may contract for a fifth month,
figures showed yesterday. The Kospi Index of stocks snapped a
three-day decline as overseas funds  bought  more of the nation’s
shares than they sold for the first time in three days.  The won fell 0.4 percent to 1,135.35 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, the weakest level since Jan. 20, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency fell 0.8 percent for
the week, posting a third consecutive loss. The currency’s one-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, slid 18 basis points to 8.25 percent.  “Recent data from  China  and  Europe  may spur risk-averse
sentiment, making the won weaken to and stay at the 1,130 per
dollar level,” said Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based currency
dealer at Daegu Bank. “We may see overseas investors demanding
the dollar for conversion as Korean companies start paying out
dividends.”  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due December 2014
climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.63
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. For the week, the rate
advanced four basis points. Three-year debt futures fell 0.04
percent to 103.47 today, while the one-year interest-rate swap
was steady at 3.56 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
