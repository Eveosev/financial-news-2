Chile ’s peso had its steepest
weekly decline since December as concern Chinese growth is
slowing dimmed the outlook for Chilean commodity exports.  The peso, little changed at 489.05 per  U.S. dollar  today,
fell 1.3 percent since March 16, the biggest weekly drop since
the five days through Dec. 16.  Copper, which accounts for more than half of Chile’s
exports, lost 1.8 percent in New York this week after data
indicated manufacturing in  China , the biggest buyer of Chilean
copper, may be slowing. The metal for May delivery advanced
today on speculation that higher energy costs will limit
production of raw materials.  “The peso finally broke through the 488 level that had
been the top of its range,” said Katia Diaz, an economist at
4Cast Inc. in  New York . “Heading into the weekend with the euro
falling and risk coming off, it seems the market doesn’t want to
go long pesos.”  China, the second-largest economy, has been Chile’s biggest
customer for the past three years. In the fourth quarter of last
year, China bought a record $4 billion of Chilean copper, more
than double the amount bought by the U.S. and  Japan  combined.  Chilean  interest-rate swaps  rose today, trimming the first
weekly decline since January. Swaps fell earlier this week as
lower commodity prices led investors to cut bets on rate rises.  The two-year swap rate climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.32 percent today, reducing a weekly
decline to 13 basis points. The two-year breakeven inflation
rate reduced a weekly decline to 19 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
