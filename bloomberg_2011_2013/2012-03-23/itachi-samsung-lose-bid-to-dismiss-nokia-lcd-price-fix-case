Hitachi Europe Ltd. and  Samsung
Electronics (005930)  Co. lost a bid to have a U.K. court throw out an
antitrust lawsuit filed by  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  over the price of liquid-
crystal displays.  A judge ruled in favor of Nokia in a London court today,
allowing the company to proceed with the price-fixing dispute
that has been going on since 2009.  The European Union fined five companies, including  AU
Optronics Corp. (2409) , 648.9 million euros ($859.6 million) in 2010
for fixing the price of liquid-crystal display panels. Sharp
Corp., Samsung and five other manufacturers in December agreed
to pay $538.6 million to settle U.S. antitrust claims filed by
indirect purchasers.  “We are pleased that the  High Court  rejected cartel
participants’ attempts to strike out these suits on procedural
grounds,” Mark Durrant, a spokesman for Espoo, Finland-based
Nokia, said in an e-mailed statement. “We will continue to
pursue the actions against cartel participants.”  Nokia in 2009 filed lawsuits in the U.K. and U.S. over the
price fixing. Maria Ivy, a spokeswoman for Samsung’s lawyers at
Covington & Burling LLP in  London , declined to comment. Caroline
Livesey, a spokeswoman for Hitachi’s lawyers at Allen & Overy
LLP, also declined to comment.  The case is Nokia v. AU Optronics, High Court of Justice
Chancery Division, No. HC09C04421.  To contact the reporter on this story:
