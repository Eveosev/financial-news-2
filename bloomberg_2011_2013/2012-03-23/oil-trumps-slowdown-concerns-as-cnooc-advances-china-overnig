Chinese stocks traded in New York 
climbed, paring a weekly drop, as concern Iranian oil exports
will decline bolstered energy companies and overshadowed signs
the world’s second-largest economy is continuing to slow.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. added 0.7 percent to 104.61 by 2:39
p.m. in  New York , reducing the weekly decline to 0.2 percent.
 PetroChina Co. (PTR) , the nation’s second-largest oil refiner, and
 Cnooc Ltd. (883) , the biggest offshore oil explorer, both rose from
two-month lows. Online retailer  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  slid 12
percent after raising less than targeted in the first initial
public offering by a Chinese company in the U.S. since August.  Oil jumped almost $3 a barrel in New York as Reuters
reported Iran’s crude exports will drop by 300,000 barrels a day
in March because of tighter sanctions linked to its nuclear
program. The surge spurred the Bloomberg gauge of U.S.-listed
Chinese equities to reverse an earlier drop of as much as 0.3
percent. Data from  home prices  to manufacturing this week have
added to concern over  China ’s economy, which grew the least for
10 quarters in the last three months of 2011.  “The number one driver of markets in the next few months
will be the  Middle East , and it’s going to be reflected in
commodity prices,” Simon Quijano-Evans, an emerging-markets
economist at ING Groep NV, said by phone from  London . “This
week has been a profit-taking week after all the rally that
we’ve seen.”  Slower Pace  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., was unchanged at $36.89, the
lowest level since Jan. 13, after declining 4.9 percent in the
week. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.3 percent, its
first advance in four days, cutting the weekly loss to 0.5
percent.  An index of leading indicators in China rose at a slower
pace in February compared to a month earlier, adding to evidence
of moderating growth in the world’s second largest economy. The
gauge increased 0.8 percent to 227.2, according to a preliminary
reading from the Conference Board. That compares with a 1.5
percent gain in January that was revised down from 1.6 percent.  Vipshop (VIPS) , a Guangzhou, China-based online retailer, plunged
12 percent to $5.75 on its first day of trading. The company
raised $71.5 million by selling 11 million American depositary
receipts for $6.50 each, according to a PR Newswire statement
yesterday. The retailer was seeking as much as $117.3 million by
offering 11.2 million ADRs for $8.50 to $10.50.  ‘Below What We Thought’  “The market environment isn’t very good and the IPO price
was below what we thought would be a fair price for our company
stock,” Eric Shen, Vipshop’s chief executive officer, said in a
phone interview yesterday.  Beijing-based PetroChina gained 1.2 percent to $142.30 in
New York, trimming its weekly decline to 3.8 percent. The  Hong
Kong  shares were unchanged at HK$11.04, the equivalent of $1.42.
Each American depositary receipt is equal to 100 ordinary
shares.  ADRs of Beijing-based Cnooc gained 1.1 percent to $211.75.
Each depositary receipt is equal to 100 ordinary shares, which
dropped 1 percent to HK$16.38, the equivalent of $2.11, in Hong
Kong trading.  Crude oil for May delivery rose $1.72, or 1.6 percent, to
$107.07 a barrel by 1:55 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Earlier, it touched $108.25 a barrel.  China Unicom Jumps  ADRs of  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (CHU) , the nation’s second-
largest mobile-phone company, gained 4.3 percent to $17.04,
poised for the biggest advance since Nov. 30 and cutting the
weekly loss to 3.5 percent. China Unicom’s Hong Kong shares
advanced 0.9 percent to HK$13.24, the equivalent of $1.70. Each
ADR is equal to 10 ordinary shares.  The Hong Kong-based mobile provider said it will boost
capital spending to expand its network by 30 percent to 100
billion yuan ($16 billion) in 2012. Investors expect “Unicom to
still gain market share” as it expands its network, Jun Zhang,
an analyst at Wedge Partners, said by phone from  Santa Clara ,
 California . The company had 40 million subscribers on its third-
generation, or 3G, network at the end of last year.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland shares
listed in Hong Kong lost 1 percent to 10,658.07, extending its
losing streak to an eighth day, the longest run of losses since
July. The gauge is down 5 percent in the week. The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 1.1 percent for a 2.3 percent weekly
decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
