Optima Energia , a Mexican company
that helps clients reduce their energy consumption, plans an
initial public offering in two or three years as demand from
businesses and governments grows.  Optima, which has helped Ritz Carlton Hotel Co. and the
city of Acapulco reduce spending on energy, estimates a $7
billion market in Mexico to replace public lighting such as
street lamps and bulbs in city offices, Chairman Enrique Gomez-
Junco said today in Mexico City. The company’s contracted sales
doubled to $40 million last year and may quadruple this year, he
said in an interview after participating in a Bloomberg CEO 
Roundtable.  An IPO is “not just an aspiration but also a very specific
goal,” Gomez-Junco said. “It’s a natural process for a mid-
sized company growing with this market opportunity.”  Mexico ,  Latin America ’s second-largest economy, had three
IPOs last year, compared with 11 in  Brazil . The nation may have
as many as 13 IPOs this year,  Luis Tellez , chief executive
officer of Mexican stock exchange operator Bolsa Mexicana de
Valores SAB, said in an interview in November.  Optima, based in Santa Catarina, Mexico, uses financing
from banks and development banks to fund its projects. Clients
pay Optima from a portion of the energy savings, Gomez-Junco
said.  “There are few energy-service companies and there are even
fewer that can carry out financed projects,” Gomez-Junco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
