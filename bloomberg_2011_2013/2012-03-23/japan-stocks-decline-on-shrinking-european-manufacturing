Japanese  shares  fell, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average falling by the most in two months,
after European manufacturing shrank more than economists
forecast, dimming the outlook for global economic growth.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  sank 2.9 percent after gains in the yen
damped the earnings outlook for the carmaker, which gets almost
85 percent of its sales abroad.  Daiwa Securities  Group Inc.,
 Japan ’s second-biggest brokerage, slipped 1.8 percent after
jumping by more than a third this year. Stadium operator  Tokyo
Dome Corp. (9681)  jumped 5.1 percent after Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities Co. raised its target price.  The Nikkei 225 lost 1.1 percent to 10,011.47 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, after falling as low as 9,999.37 earlier today,
the first time since March 13 that it fell below the 10,000
level. The gauge declined 1.2 percent this week, its first fall
in seven weeks. The broader Topix Index lost 1.1 percent to
852.53, with about 2.5 shares declining for each that rose.
Trading volume was 28 percent below the 30-day average.  “Investors have been looking at the situation in the U.S.
and  Europe  optimistically and have been buying shares, but that
energy is exhausting itself,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund
manager  at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which oversees the
equivalent of $68 billion. “If you look at the situation
rationally, there’s a lot of risk still out there.”  European Manufacturing Contracts  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.1
percent today. The gauge lost 0.7 percent in  New York  yesterday
as a report showing manufacturing contracted in Europe added to
pessimism about the global economy after an earlier report
showed China factory activity also shrank.  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers dropped in February, showing unexpected contraction in
the manufacturing and services industries, London-based Markit
Economics said yesterday.  Exporters declined after the yen rose against all of its 16
major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  Honda fell 2.9 percent to 3,180 yen.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an
electronic components maker that gets more than a third of its
revenue from the U.S. and Europe, retreated 1.8 percent to 7,480
yen.  Yen Strengthens  The yen appreciated to as high as 108.49 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 110.44 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday. Japan’s currency strengthened to 82.33
against the dollar from 83.39. A stronger yen cuts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Brokerages, which gained  the most  this year among the
Topix’s 33 industry groups, were the biggest decliners today on
the gauge.  Daiwa Securities slipped 1.8 percent to 337 yen. Nomura
Holdings Inc., Japan’s biggest brokerage, lost 3.8 percent to
376 yen after jumping by more than a half this year. The company
fell 1.3 percent yesterday after being linked to an insider-
trading case by a person familiar with the matter.  “Considering how much Japan has risen, it wouldn’t be a
surprise if we saw some correction given the slowing in the
yen’s declines and slowdowns in Europe and China,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $27.6 billion.  Bull Market  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  has risen more than 20 percent since its low
in November on signs of a U.S. economic recovery, progress on
tackling Europe’s debt crisis and additional monetary easing by
the  Bank of Japan . The  bull market  has helped the benchmark
equity index nearly recoup all of its losses since last year’s
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crises.  Among companies that gained,  Tokyo Dome (9681) , which operates a
baseball stadium and hotels, jumped 5.1 percent to 270 yen after
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities raised its stock price
estimate to 330 yen from 240 yen, saying profit was recovering
quickly from effects of last year’s earthquake and related
power-savings measures. The brokerage maintained its
“outperform” rating, according to a report dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
