(Corrects name in headline.)  Juergen Stark, the German who quit
as the  European Central Bank ’s chief economist last year, said
liquidity the ECB has injected into the financial system boosts
the risk of inflation, Handelsblatt reported.  The running time of the central bank’s three-year loans to
banks to fight the euro-area debt crisis is long and makes it
more difficult to design an exit strategy to reduce liquidity,
Stark, a former ECB Executive Board member, told the Dusseldorf-
based newspaper in an interview published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
