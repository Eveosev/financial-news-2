Jim Moser , the deputy chief
economist at the U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission , this
month will leave the agency, which is in charge of writing new
rules for the global swaps market under the Dodd-Frank Act.  Moser, who analyzed Dodd-Frank rules restricting
speculation in oil and other commodities, as well as the costs
and benefits of regulations, will join  American University  in
Washington to direct the master’s in finance program, he said in
a telephone interview today.  “I’m looking forward to having an influence on policy
coming from a different direction. What I want to do is train
people to be more effective at the intersection, if you will,
between finance and law,” said Moser, who was acting chief
economist in 2010. “As it is, the legislation is getting more
and more into finance theory and quantitative aspects, and the
lawyers don’t understand that and certainly the quantitative
people that are financially trained don’t understand the law.
What I’m trying to do is kind of fill that gap.”  Moser was previously a research officer at the  Federal
 Reserve Bank  of Chicago and a senior director at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, according to  the CFTC .  Dodd-Frank, the financial-regulation overhaul enacted in
2010, requires the CFTC to write rules intended to have most
swaps guaranteed by central clearinghouses and traded on
exchanges or other platforms.  To contact the reporters on this story:
