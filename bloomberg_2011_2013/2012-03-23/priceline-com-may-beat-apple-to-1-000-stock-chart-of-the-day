Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN)  is closer to
$1,000 a share than  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , and comments by Piper Jaffray
Cos. analysts indicate the online travel agency will break that
barrier sooner.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows closing prices for both stocks
since Jan. 15, 2010. That’s when  Gene Munster , a Piper analyst
who follows Apple, discussed the possibility of a $1,000 price
during an interview with the Business Insider website.  Priceline.com’s prospects for getting there were outlined
yesterday by  Michael Olson , one of Munster’s colleagues at the
Minneapolis-based firm. The stock has “a realistic path” to
reach that level by mid-2014, he wrote in a report.  Earnings per share are poised to increase 21 percent
annually on an adjusted basis for 2011 through 2015, he wrote.
At that pace, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company will have
an annual profit of $50 a share when the period ends. A $1,000
price equals 20 times the eventual earnings.  “This is not a stretch in our view,” Olson wrote, as
Priceline.com will be the main beneficiary of a shift toward
booking travel online. His 12-month estimate for the stock is
$763, the third-highest of 19 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Priceline.com exceeded $700 a share on March 21, four days
after Apple first traded for more than $600. The stocks closed
yesterday at $711.99 and $599.34, respectively.  Munster didn’t disagree with  Henry Blodget , Business
Insider’s chief executive officer and editor-in-chief, in 2010
when asked whether Apple will rise to $1,000 in five years. The
analyst never actually predicted that the maker of iPhones and
iPads, based in Cupertino, California, will reach that price.
His projection for the next 12 months is $718.  To contact the reporter on this story:
