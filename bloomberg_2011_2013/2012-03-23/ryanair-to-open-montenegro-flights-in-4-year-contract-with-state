Montenegro said  Ryanair Holdings
Plc (RYA) ,  Europe ’s biggest discount carrier, will start seasonal
flights to the Adriatic Sea country in a four-year contract that
offers government incentives to boost tourism.  The flights will begin in June, initially from London,
Brussels and Milan, Italy, before adding at least three more
destinations by 2014, Montenegro’s  Tourism Ministry  said in an
e-mailed statement. The state said it would help lower airport
fees to not more than 10 euros ($13.2) per departing passenger
and cover part of promotional costs.  As of 2013, the flights will be starting in late March,
helping expand the tourist season and bringing some 50,000
visitors a year by 2015, under the agreement that the carrier’s
board of directors is expected to approve today, the  government 
said. The smallest state of the former  Yugoslavia  has two
 airports , in the coastal city of Tivat and near the capital
Podgorica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
