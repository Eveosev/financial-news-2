Japanese refiner  Idemitsu Kosan Co. (5019) 
and oil and gas explorer  Inpex Corp. (1605)  are considering building a
geothermal power plant in Fukushima as the nation seeks to
diversify its energy sources.  The companies are considering conducting a study for
possible sites, Tetsuji Yoshimine, a spokesman for Inpex, said
by phone today. Idemitsu is considering developing geothermal
power in Fukushima, company spokesman Kei Uchikawa said by
phone.  The Nikkei reported today that the companies plan to build
a 270-megawatt geothermal plant, the largest in the country, in
Fukushima. Yoshimine said a decision hasn’t been made.  Japan plans to ease regulations on building geothermal
projects in national parks, where more than 80 percent of the
resources lie. The country is seeking to diversify its energy
mix following the earthquake and tsunami that crippled Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station last
year.  Japan  has 537 megawatts of installed geothermal capacity,
accounting for 0.2 percent of its total power generation output,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. No new projects of
more than 10 megawatts have been developed since 1996, the
research agency said.  Inpex and Idemitsu haven’t decided how many plants they
plan to build in Fukushima, he said. “We don’t know how soon we
can start operations,” he said. “It can’t start in a year or
two.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
