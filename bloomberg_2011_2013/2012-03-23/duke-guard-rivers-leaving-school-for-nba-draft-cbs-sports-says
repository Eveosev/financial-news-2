Duke University guard Austin Rivers
is entering the National Basketball Association draft after one
year with the Blue Devils,  CBS Sports  reported, citing multiple
people it didn’t identify.  The son of Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers will sign with
an agent, meaning he can’t return to college basketball, CBS
said.  Most mock drafts have Rivers, who averaged 15.5 points, 3.4
rebounds and 2.1 assists this season, as a top-15 pick. Rivers
hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to beat  North Carolina  on Feb. 8,
ending the Tar Heels’ 31-game home winning streak.  Duke was upset by Lehigh in the round of 64 of the men’s
college basketball tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
