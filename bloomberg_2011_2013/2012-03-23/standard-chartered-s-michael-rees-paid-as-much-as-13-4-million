Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ’s  Mike Rees ,
head of corporate banking, may be paid as much as $13.4 million
for 2011, the highest-compensated director on the board.  The total includes $1.12 million in salary and deferred
shares of $6 million, the London-based company said in its
 annual report  published today. The package amounts to a 5
percent drop from his $14.1 million package for 2010.  Rees’s division contributes about three-quarters of the
lender’s profit and includes investment banking activities such
as equities, and mergers and advisory services. His variable pay
dropped as profit growth for his division “was not as strong as
2010,” the bank said.  Standard Chartered , the U.K.’s second-largest bank by
market value, said it plans to hire as many as 2,600 employees
after posting its eighth straight year of record earnings on
growth in corporate and consumer lending. Net income rose to
$4.85 billion in 2011 from $4.33 billion a year earlier, the
bank said on Feb. 29.  Chief Executive Officer  Peter Sands  may receive total pay
of as much as $8.1 million, up 3.5 percent from 2010, the bank
said. The bank’s five highest-paid employees got $42.1 million
for 2011, the company said.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Stephen Taylor  To contact the reporter on this story:
