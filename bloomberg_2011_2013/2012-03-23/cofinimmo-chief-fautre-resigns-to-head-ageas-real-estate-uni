Cofinimmo SA (COFB)  Chief Executive
Officer Serge Fautre, who spearheaded a shift at  Belgium ’s
biggest real-estate investment fund away from offices, resigned
to head AG Real Estate, a unit of Belgian insurer  Ageas. (AGS)   Fautre, 51, took over as CEO of Cofinimmo in 2002 and
starting in 2005 led the fund’s diversification drive. Fautre
began acquiring nursing homes and participating in public-
private partnerships such as prisons and fire stations to reduce
Cofinimmo’s dependence on the Belgian office market.  In 2007, Fautre bought most of InBev NV’s Belgian and Dutch
pubs. At the end of last year, offices represented 49 percent of
its real estate and more than one-fifth of the company’s
investments are outside Belgium, with 16 percent in  France .  “At this stage, it is difficult to bank on Cofinimmo
finding a CEO with similar qualities and experience,” said
Jean-Marie Caucheteux, an analyst at Bank Degroof in Brussels
who rates the stock “hold.” “It is difficult to measure the
impact of this departure on the direction and the speed of
Cofinimmo’s strategy of moving away from offices.”  Fautre will succeed Alain Devos as chief executive of AG
Real Estate “in the near future,” AG said in a statement.
Cofinimmo, in a separate release, said it will take “all
necessary transition measures to ensure the succession as soon
as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
