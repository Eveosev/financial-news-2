SAP AG (SAP) , whose shares this month
reached their highest level in 11 years, increased the salaries
of co-Chief Executive Officers Jim Hagemann Snabe and  Bill McDermott .  For 2011, McDermott received 6.57 million euros ($8.7
million) and Snabe was paid 5.49 million euros, the company said
today in a statement. That’s an increase of 49 percent for
McDermott and of 42 percent for Snabe. The salaries of both CEOs
included 950,000 euros in share-based bonuses for both 2010 and
2011.  SAP has  gained  27 percent this year in Frankfurt trading as
technology companies benefit from demand for applications that
allow consumers and companies to access data via smartphones and
tablet computers. Snabe said this month that SAP, which has more
than 54,000 employees and is based in Walldorf, will extend a
stock-based compensation program to all workers.  SAP needs to retain top-performing employees as it plans to
boost annual revenue with the help of cloud-computing software,
mobile applications gained through its Sybase acquisition and
the Hana technology, which enables processing of large amounts
of data on the fly.  The company will pay between 460 million euros and 500
milion euros this year for the new employee bonus program which
also ties compensation to the share price, SAP Chief Accountant
Christoph Huetten said at a press conference in  Frankfurt  today.
The company paid 69 million euros in share-based compensation in
2011, according to Huetten.  Virtual Shares  Employees will be allocated virtual shares at the beginning
of each year. The company’s financial performance will then
determine how many will be paid out at the end of the financial
year, according to the statement.  “We want the employee to feel as though he’s a shareholder
and feels invested in the performance of the company,” Huetten
said.  SAP, whose biggest rival is  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , today reiterated
its 2015 targets for more than 20 billion euros in annual
revenue and a 35 percent operating margin.  The company’s shares dropped 1 percent to 52.98 euros as of
1:50 p.m. in Frankfurt trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
