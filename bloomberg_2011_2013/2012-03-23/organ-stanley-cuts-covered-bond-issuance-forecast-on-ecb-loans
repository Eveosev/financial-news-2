Morgan Stanley (MS)  cut its forecast for
euro-denominated covered bond sales this year by as much as 47
percent after the  European Central Bank ’s program of cheap loans
eased pressure on banks to raise cash from the secured debt.  Sales of the loan-backed securities may slump to as low as
100 billion euros ($132 billion) in 2012 from a November
estimate of 190 billion euros, analysts Leef Dierks and Jason Somerville in  London  wrote in an investor note today. French
banks, the biggest sellers of the notes this year, may cut
issuance by 33 percent to 30 billion euros.  The ECB provided euro-area banks with more than $1 trillion
of three-year loans in two so-called longer-term refinancing
operations aimed at averting a credit crunch. The program
bolstered investor confidence in the region’s banks and helped
spur a rally in credit markets.  “Given the impact the ECB’s two 36-month LTROs have had on
 capital markets , we have revised our forecast,” the analysts
wrote.  Net supply of covered bonds, the difference between new
issues and securities that are redeemed, may shrink to about 13
billion euros from the previous estimate of 93.3 billion euros,
Morgan Stanley said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
