Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the insurer scaling back amid investor demands for a
breakup, offered as much as $2 million in a retention bonus to
David Levenson, president of  wealth management .  Levenson must remain “actively employed by the company in
the performance of his duties on certain specified payment dates
through February 28, 2013,” Hartford, based in the Connecticut
city of the same name, said today in a regulatory filing.
Levenson, who reports to Chief Executive Officer Liam McGee,
joined Hartford in 1995 from Fidelity Investments,  Hartford is seeking buyers for businesses that sell
individual life-insurance policies and 401(k) retirement
accounts, the company said this week. It will also halt sales of
variable annuities, the equity-based savings products that
contributed to losses during the market slump of 2008 and early
2009. Levenson told investors at a December conference he was
prepared to reshape his businesses to improve results.  “I am comfortable making tough decisions,” Levenson said
on Dec. 8. “These may range from personnel changes to cutting
expenses to shutting down or selling businesses that are not
profitable or core.”  The company is responding to calls from billionaire  John Paulson , who controls the biggest stake in Hartford, to split
its life-insurance and retirement businesses from its property-
casualty unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
