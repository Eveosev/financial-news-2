Scottrade Inc., a discount online
brokerage, will cooperate with three U.S. states in a probe of
possible antitrust violations in the retail securities brokerage
industry, the  Connecticut  attorney general said.  Scottrade reached an agreement to cooperate with the
inquiry and any resulting litigation, according to a statement
today from Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen. The deal
was reached with Connecticut, Iowa and  Missouri , according to a
letter posted at the attorney general’s website.  The investigation focuses on possible collusive conduct by
several retail securities brokers and firms that assist brokers
in executing orders, Jepsen said. The conduct may have hindered
competition, according to the statement.  “Scottrade’s client-centric focus and core values of trust
and integrity are important aspects of how we do business every
day, and we are pleased that this matter has been resolved,”
Scottrade spokeswoman Leigh Hamer said in an e-mailed statement.  As part of the agreement, the St. Louis-based company will
create an antitrust compliance policy and training program for
employees, the attorney general’s office said. Scottrade didn’t
admit wrongdoing, according to the office.  To contact the reporters on this story:
