Asian stocks fell, with the
regional benchmark index posting its biggest weekly loss this
year, on concern slowdowns in  China  and Europe will weigh on the
global economy, damping demand for growth-sensitive equities.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 31 percent of its
sales in Europe, lost 2.5 percent in Tokyo.  Guangzhou R&F
Properties Co. (2777) , the biggest developer in the southern Chinese
city, slid 5.9 percent in  Hong Kong  after mainland  home prices 
posted the worst performance in a year. Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. rose 5.3 percent to NT$85.4 in Taipei after
the world’s largest contract maker of chips said it may boost
 capital spending  to meet demand.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.3 percent to 126.33, the
biggest weekly loss since the period ended Dec. 16. The gauge
has climbed 12.5 percent this year amid optimism a U.S. economic
recovery will brighten the earnings outlook for the region’s
exporters. The rally boosted the value of stocks on the measure
to 14.9  estimated earnings  on average as of March 23, compared
with 13.4 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.1
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  “People are starting to realize that things are not as
great as initially thought,” said Lee King Fuei, a Singapore-
based  fund manager  at Schroders Plc, which oversees about $326
billion of assets globally. “There’s a risk of much slower
growth in China should bad debts climb and banks raise capital
or restrict lending.”  Japan’s Trade Surplus  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 1.2 percent this
week, snapping a six-week rally, after the nation posted an
unexpected  trade surplus , strengthening the yen. South Korea’s
 Kospi (KOSPI)  Index lost 0.4 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slid
0.1 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined 3 percent this week.
The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the larger of China’s
stock exchanges, lost 2.3 percent even after the central bank
cut reserve requirements to more branches of  Agricultural Bank
of China Ltd. (1288)   Asian stocks fell after a preliminary report on March 22
showed China’s manufacturing may contract for a fifth month in
March. Shares also declined after a euro-area composite index
dropped in February, showing unexpected contraction in the
manufacturing and services industries, London-based Markit
Economics said.  Exporters Fall  Canon slid 2.5 percent to 3,870 yen.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) ,
a clothier that counts Europe as its biggest market, dropped 3.2
percent to HK$16.44.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a Japanese construction
machinery maker that gets 23 percent of its sales in China, fell
3.8 percent to 2,344 yen.  Chinese developers fell in Hong Kong after new home prices
fell in 27 of 70 mainland cities last month from a year earlier,
the worst reading since the government began releasing
individual data for cities last year.  Guangzhou R&F slipped 5.9 percent to HK$9.06. Soho China
Ltd., a developer in Shanghai and Beijing, fell 3 percent to
HK$5.42.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s
biggest lender by market value, dropped 4.9 percent to HK$5.02.  China’s “property market is still the biggest risk the
economy is facing now and there’s lots of uncertainty to the
sector,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dazhong
Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “Earnings and the
economy have yet to bottom out.”  China Shares Fall  Agricultural Bank of China  slid 7.8 percent to HK$3.41
after posting lower-than-expected earnings. China Rongsheng
Heavy Industries Group Holdings Ltd., the biggest shipbuilder
listed in Hong Kong, declined a record 17 percent to HK$2.16
after profit tumbled 59 percent.  Of the 591 companies in the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  that
have  reported earnings  since Jan. 9, 349 have missed analysts’
estimates while 171 have beat estimates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that gained on the week, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing rose 5.3 percent to NT$85.4 after saying it may
invest more capital to meet growing demand for chips. Taiwan’s
