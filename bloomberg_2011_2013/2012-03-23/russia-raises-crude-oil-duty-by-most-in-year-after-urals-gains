Russia , the world’s biggest  oil 
producer, will increase its  export duty  on most crude shipments
by 12 percent from April 1, the biggest gain in a year, after
Urals prices climbed to the highest level since 2008.  The standard duty will jump to $460.70 a metric ton, or
$62.85 a barrel, from $411.20 a ton in March, according to an
order signed by Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  and published
today on the government  website . The discounted rate on some
Eastern Siberian and Caspian Sea oil will rise to $241.50 a ton
from $204.40 this month.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals crude
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
 Urals (RUOIEX%) , Russia’s benchmark export blend, averaged $123.53 to a
barrel during the most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a
Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone on March 15. In the
previous monitoring period, the crude price averaged $112.22,
according to the ministry.  On March 1, Urals exceeded $125 a barrel, the highest since
July 2008, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. It has since
declined.  The government lowered the crude  tax rate  in October,
applying a coefficient of 60 percent, down from 65 percent, and
unifying the duty on most refined products at 66 percent of that
levy. Without that reduction, the April crude duty would have
set a record, exceeding the previous high of $495.90 a ton in
August and September of 2008.  The duty for middle distillates and heavy products will
rise to $304 a ton next month from $271.40 in March.  A gasoline tax that Putin imposed from May to counter
domestic shortages will increase to $414.60 a ton, from $370.10
this month. That is 90 percent of the crude duty. The government
may raise the duty on liquefied petroleum gases such as butane
and propane to $158.60 a ton from $157.30 this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
