Anadolu Hayat Emeklilik AS (ANHYT) ,
 Turkey â€™s largest pension provider, rose to its highest since
July after Milliyet newspaper reported tax incentives for
corporate contributions to pension funds may be doubled.  Anadolu Hayat shares gained 1.8 percent to 4.04 liras at
the close in Istanbul, bringing their weekly increase to 6
percent.  The government may propose increasing the corporate tax
write-off to 20 percent from 10 percent, Milliyet reported,
without saying how it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
