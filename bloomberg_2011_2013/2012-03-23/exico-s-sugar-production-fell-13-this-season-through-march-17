Sugar output in  Mexico , the world’s
sixth-largest producer, fell 13 percent so far this season,
according to industry committee Conadesuca.  Production in the 2011-12 season, which started in October,
totaled 3.17 million metric tons through March 17, Conadesuca
said in a report on its  website  on March 21. That compares with
3.64 million tons in the same period in 2010-11.  Mexico will produce 5.1 million tons of sugar this season,
down from a previous forecast of 5.3 million tons, Conadesuca
said on Feb. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
