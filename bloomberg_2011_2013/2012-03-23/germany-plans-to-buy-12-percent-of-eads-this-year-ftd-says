Germany  plans to boost its stake in
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. by 12 percent this year
by purchasing shares owned by  Daimler AG (DAI)  and the Dedalus
consortium, FTD  reported , citing unnamed people close to the
government.  The country would through the state-owned development bank
Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau buy a 7.5 percent stake held by
Daimler and as much as 4.5 percent of the shares owned by the
Dedalus group of private banks, according to FTD. The purchase
would let Germany match  France â€™s 15 percent stake, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
