Canadian natural gas rose as
warmer-than-normal weather in the U.S. boosted demand for
electricity to run air conditioners.  Alberta  gas advanced 1.2 percent. Atlanta may have a high
temperature tomorrow of 74 degrees Fahrenheit (23 Celsius), 7
above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. Dallas’s high may be
84 degrees, 13 above normal, the  State College , Pennsylvania-
based forecaster said.  “There’s some cooling demand coming pretty soon with the
heat,” said Eric Bickel, a natural gas analyst with Summit
Energy Services in Louisville,  Kentucky . “Demand for power is
remaining robust and gas is at a good price for buyers.”  Alberta gas for April delivery rose 2.25 cents to $1.83 a
gigajoule ($1.73 per million British thermal units) as of 11:50
a.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
is down 0.6 percent this week.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 4.6 cents to $2.315 per million Btu at 12:03 p.m.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.9 billion cubic
feet, 61 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.79 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.2 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.04 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.61 billion cubic feet today, or 61 percent
of its capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.13
billion cubic feet at 10:50 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
