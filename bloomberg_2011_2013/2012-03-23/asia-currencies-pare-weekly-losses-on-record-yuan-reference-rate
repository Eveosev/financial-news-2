Asian currencies advanced, paring
weekly losses, after  China ’s central bank set the yuan’s rate at
a record high, boosting the outlook for exports to the world’s
second-biggest economy.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY)  snapped a three-
day drop as the People’s Bank of China set the reference rate
0.18 percent stronger. China is the largest overseas market for
 Thailand , South Korea and Taiwan. Thailand’s baht rebounded from
a one-week low as foreign funds increased holdings of the
nation’s assets after the central bank raised its economic
growth estimate.  “If China’s policy is to boost domestic demand, ultimately
the currency needs to appreciate,” said  Nizam Idris , a
Singapore-based strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd. “An
appreciating currency boosts domestic purchasing power, which
would be supportive of consumption.”  The ringgit gained 0.5 percent yesterday, the most in two
weeks, to 3.0768 per dollar in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Thailand’s baht climbed 0.2 percent to
30.77 and Philippine’s peso rose 0.2 percent to 42.963.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY)  extended losses
for the week to 0.5 percent. The gauge’s 60-day historical
 volatility  rose to 3.50 percent from 3.45 percent last week.  ‘A Surprise’  The yuan fell 0.1 percent yesterday and strengthened 0.2
percent this week to 6.3078 per dollar. The currency gained 0.17
percent in the last 30 minutes of trading on March 22, spurring
speculation the monetary authority was buying the yuan.  “The fixing is such a surprise,” said  Liu Dongliang , a
senior analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the
nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “The central bank is probably
trying to remind the market appreciation isn’t over yet.”  The ringgit pared its weekly decline to 0.5 percent.
Malaysia’s gross domestic product may rise 4 percent to 5
percent this year,  Bank Negara Malaysia  said on March 21, lower
than a prediction of 5 percent to 6 percent the Finance Ministry
made in October and an increase of 5.1 percent in 2011.  The baht fell 0.1 percent during the week. Global funds
poured a net $834 million into local equities this month through
March 22, according to exchange data. The Thai economy will
expand 5.7 percent this year, compared with a previous estimate
of 4.9 percent, central bank Assistant Governor Paiboon
Kittisrikangwan said on March 21.  Philippine’s peso advanced after Finance Secretary Cesar
Purisima said he is confident that a credit rating upgrade from
Standard and Poor’s may come sooner than later, he said in a
briefing in Manila yesterday.  Elsewhere,  South Korea ’s won fell 0.4 percent yesterday and
0.9 percent this week to 1,135.35 per dollar. Taiwan’s dollar
was steady yesterday and lost 0.1 percent this week to
NT$29.585.  India ’s rupee fell 2 percent this week through March
22 to 51.22. The nation’s currency markets were closed for a
public holiday yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
