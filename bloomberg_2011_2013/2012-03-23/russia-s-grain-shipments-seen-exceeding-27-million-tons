Russia’s  grain exports  may exceed
the government’s forecast of 27 million metric tons in the
marketing year that will end on June 30, SovEcon said.  Traders may export 1.8 million tons of grains this month,
up from 1.2 million tons in February, after ice thinned,
allowing easier navigation of the Azov Sea and some rivers,
Andrei Sizov Jr., managing director of the Moscow-based
researcher, said by phone. Grain exports may exceed 2 million
tons in April, he said. Grain sales from state stockpiles that
could begin by early next month may bolster exports also, Sizov
said.  Viktor Zubkov , first deputy prime minister, said on March
19 the country’s exports had reached 22 million tons and may
climb as high as 27 million tons.  Russia’s grain crop will probably be about the same as last
year’s, the  Agriculture Ministry  said. The country harvested
94.2 million tons of grains in 2011, according to revised state
statistics data, Dmitry Bobkov, ministry spokesman, said today
by phone in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
