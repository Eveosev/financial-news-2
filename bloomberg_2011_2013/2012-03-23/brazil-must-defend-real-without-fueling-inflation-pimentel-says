The challenge for the Brazilian
government is to defend the real without driving up inflation,
Trade Minister Fernando Pimentel said.  The government can’t intervene on the currency “too
aggressively because it could affect inflation,” he told
reporters in Brasilia today.  President  Dilma Rousseff  has condemned the loose monetary
policy of the U.S. and  Europe , saying in a speech in Germany on
March 5 that it was forcing a “monetary tsunami” on  Brazil .
European and U.S. investors seeking higher returns have been
buying Brazilian bonds. The influx of foreign capital has
strengthened the real, which reached a 12-year high against the
dollar last year.  The currency was the biggest gainer of 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg in the first two months of this year, and
the biggest faller this month.  The real declined 0.2 percent to 1.8223 against the U.S.
currency as of 11:15 a.m. in Brasilia.  Annual inflation eased to 5.61 percent through mid-March,
the slowest pace since 2010. The central bank targets inflation
of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  has said Brazil has an
“infinite arsenal” of measures it may use against investors
driving up the real.  The government would prefer a Latin American candidate for
the post of World Bank president, Pimentel also said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
