OAO Russian Railways lowered the
guidance on a benchmark-sized seven-year ruble Eurobond to a
yield of about 8.3 percent, Interfax reported, citing a banker
with knowledge of the deal last yesterday.  Yield guidance was cut to 8.375 percent yesterday from
about 8.5 percent.  Several days after the ruble Eurobond sale, Russian
Railways may issue dollar bonds with a longer maturity, the news
service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
