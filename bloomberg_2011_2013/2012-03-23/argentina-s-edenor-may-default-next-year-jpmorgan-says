Empresa Distribuidora &
Comercializadora Norte SA (EDN)  fell to its lowest price in almost
three years after JPMorgan Chase & Co. said the Argentine power
distributor may default on its bond payment next year as the
government’s caps on utility rates constrain cash flows.  Shares in the company, also known as Edenor, fell 1.9
percent to 1.03 pesos at the close in Buenos Aires, the lowest
price since June 2009.  Edenor won’t default this year and bonds would see
“significant upside” if negotiations with the government over
tariffs produce positive results, analyst Isabela Bacchi wrote
in the report today. JPMorgan maintained its recommendation to
buy Edenor bonds due in 2022.  Yields on Edenor bonds due in 2022 fell 16 basis points, or
0.16 percentage point, to 18.5 percent at 5:25 p.m. in  Buenos
Aires , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. They have
soared 405 basis points in the past month.  A telephone message and e-mail sent to Alberto Lippi, a
spokesman at Edenor, weren’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporters on this story:
