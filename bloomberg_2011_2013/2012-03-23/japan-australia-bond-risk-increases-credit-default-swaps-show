The cost of insuring Japanese and
Australian corporate and sovereign bonds from default rose,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index climbed 1 basis point to 164
basis points as of 9:48 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The index is set to close up 7 basis points since close on
March 21, when the new Series 17 started trading, according to
data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index jumped 5 basis points to
143 basis points as of 11:46 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The previous Series 16 index closed at
124.9 on March 20, dropping from 180.5 on Dec. 30, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 2 basis points to 153.5 basis
points as of 8:49 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
