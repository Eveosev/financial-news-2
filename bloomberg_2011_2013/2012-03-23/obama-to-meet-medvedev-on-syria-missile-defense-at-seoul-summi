President Barack Obama will hold a
one-on-one meeting with his Russian counterpart  Dmitry Medvedev 
in Seoul to discuss the deadly conflict in Syria and missile
defense, according to a Kremlin aide.  Obama and Medvedev are among about 50 world leaders
attending the Nuclear Security Summit in South Korea on March
26-27. Iran and  North Korea , which are in violation of United
Nations resolutions requiring them to halt their nuclear work,
are excluded because of organizers’ desire to reach consensus.  The continued fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan will also be
a topic for the U.S. and Russian presidents’ talks, Sergei
Prikhodko, Medvedev’s foreign policy aide, told reporters today
in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
