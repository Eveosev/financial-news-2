West Ham United submitted a bid to
use the Olympic stadium after the Games end later this year, the
 London  soccer club said.  The deadline to apply to take over the facility is today,
and West Ham is applying to be the anchor tenant of the site, it
said on its website. The plan is supported by U.K. Athletics,
and keeps the ability to host track meets, including the 2017
World Athletics Championships.  “It has been my firm, unwavering belief that the stadium
can truly become a multi-use destination of which east London
and the nation as a whole can be proud,” West Ham vice chairman
Karren Brady said in the statement.    London organizers recommended in February 2011 a bid from
the east London-based West Ham and the borough of Newham over a
joint attempt by Tottenham Hotspur and AEG, a U.S.-based
entertainment facility operator.  In October, the agreement to award the occupancy to the
Hammers, who had promised to keep the running track, collapsed
following a series of legal challenges from Tottenham and east
London soccer club Leyton Orient. Spurs wanted to make it a
soccer-only stadium and pay to refurbish a
running center in south London, but has gotten support for a new
stadium in Haringey, north London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
