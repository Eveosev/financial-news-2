The European Union today  added  12
Belarusians to its visa-ban list and froze the assets of 29
companies that it says are controlled by people who support the
government of Aleksandr Lukashenko.  “Instead of increasing repression, Belarus must release
and rehabilitate all political prisoners and roll back its
repressive policies,” EU foreign-policy chief  Catherine Ashton 
said, according to a statement published on the bloc’s website.  More than 200 Belarusians are already on the EU’s visa-ban
and asset-freeze list, according to the statement. The 27-nation
bloc has also blocked the assets of three companies it says are
linked to the country’s government and prohibited arms exports
to Belarus, the EU said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
