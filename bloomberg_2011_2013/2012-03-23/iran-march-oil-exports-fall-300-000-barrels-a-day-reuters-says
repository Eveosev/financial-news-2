Iranian oil exports fell about
300,000 barrels a day this month as buyers curbed purchases
because of sanctions, Reuters reported, citing Petrologistics
and a source at one  oil company  it didnâ€™t identify.  Petrologistics, a Geneva-based consultant, said exports
from  Iran  may fall to 1.9 million barrels a day in March from
about 2.2 million barrels a day in February, Reuters said.  No one at Petrologistics was immediately available for
comment when called today by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
