Peruvian bond yields increased the
most in four months after a leading economic index for  China 
rose at a slower pace in February, damping the outlook for the
Andean nation’s metal exports.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 climbed five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 5.46 percent at 4:32 p.m. in Lima,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the steepest
rise since Dec. 12. The security’s price fell 0.37 centimo to
115.75 centimos per sol.  The gauge of Chinese activity gained 0.8 percent in
February from the previous month, the Conference Board, a New
York-based research group, said today, citing a preliminary
reading. The index rose 1.5 percent in January. The data added
to concern the world’s second-largest economy is slowing after
retail sales and manufacturing eased and  home prices  declined.
Chinese demand for copper, gold and iron ore made it Peru’s top
export market last year.  “ There are worries about China demand and metals that
Peru produces,” said Bret Rosen, a Latin America strategist at
Standard Chartered Bank in New York.  Peru’s overseas sales of copper by volume fell 15 percent
in February, compared with the same month a year earlier, export
group Comexperu said today, citing preliminary customs data.  The sol was unchanged at 2.6690 per  U.S. dollar  at today’s
close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The central bank said it didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the
 spot market  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
