Gasoline jumped to a 10-month high
on speculation the  U.S. economy  is recovering and concern that
tensions over Iran’s nuclear program may limit oil supply.  Futures gained 1.4 percent, following crude oil higher. The
dollar fell against the euro for the first time in four days,
dropping 0.5 percent at 2:52 p.m. in  New York . The Labor
Department reported yesterday that  jobless claims  declined last
week to the lowest level in four years.  “The dollar keeps weakening and concern about Iran and
supply disruptions is back in and you’re getting some short-
covering because of it,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Gasoline for April delivery rose 4.56 cents to settle at
$3.3852 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
rose 0.8 percent this week, the seventh consecutive weekly
increase and longest win streak since futures rose 12 straight
weeks through April 13, 2007.  Futures have climbed 26 percent this year, making gasoline
the best performer in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24
commodities.  Gasoline hit the highest level since April 29 as  Brent
crude  for May settlement in  London  surged on a Reuters report
that Iran’s oil exports will fall by 300,000 barrels a day this
month. Brent reached $127.06 a barrel before retreating to
$125.13. May crude on the Nymex touched $108.25 a barrel, before
settling $1.52 higher at $106.87.  Some analysts doubted the report’s impact on the market,
citing below-average volume.  ‘Nervous’ Market  “There is no headline that would do this,” said Amrita Sen, a London-based analyst at  Barclays Capital . “You’ve got a
market that is really nervous on both sides, on the crude side
because of lack of capacity and on the gasoline side that demand
is falling off and that supplies are getting squeezed and
refinery glitches happen all the time.”  Gasoline touched $3.4248 a gallon at 9:55 a.m. before
paring gains. Volume was 125,694 as of 4:08 p.m., compared with
a three-month average of 140,000.  “I’ve never seen anything like this,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
Stamford,  Connecticut . “Computer-driven trading is getting a
little out of hand. The market just pushed through overnight
highs and that triggered algorithms.”  Gasoline surged this year on concern that refinery
shutdowns would tighten supply and as concern about tensions
over  Iran’s nuclear program  sent oil higher. Nymex crude is up
8.1 percent this year, while Brent oil in London has jumped 17
percent and is the second-best performer this year on the GSCI.  China Slowdown  Prices fell the prior three days on concern that growth in
China is slowing and that higher prices at the pump will stifle
U.S. fuel demand. A preliminary measure of Chinese manufacturing
fell to a four-month low. U.S. average pump prices are up 19
percent this year, according to AAA.  “Iranian tensions will not go away,” said  James Cordier ,
portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa, Florida. “And
today is a great example of the market discounting the fact that
 China ’s growth is slowing because the U.S. economy is now taking
up the slack.”  The U.S.  unemployment rate  was 8.3 percent for a second
consecutive month in February, down from 9.1 percent as recently
as August. U.S.  retail sales  climbed the most in five months in
February. The number of Americans saying the U.S. economy is
getting better rose in March to the highest level since 2004,
according to Bloomberg’s monthly consumer expectations survey.  “The U.S. economy seems to be getting better,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Heating oil for April delivery gained 3.14 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $3.2101 a gallon. Prices slipped 2.2
percent this week and are up 9.4 percent in 2012.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.8
cent to $3.889 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA, the
nation’s biggest motoring group. Prices are 9.6 percent higher
than a year ago. Gasoline peaked in 2011 at $3.985 on May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
