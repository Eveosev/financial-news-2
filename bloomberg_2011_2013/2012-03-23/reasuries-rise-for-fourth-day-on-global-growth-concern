Treasuries (YCGT0025)  rose for a fourth day in
their longest winning streak in almost a month as an unexpected
drop in U.S. home sales added to skepticism that the pace of the
economic recovery will diminish the refuge appeal of  U.S. debt .  Thirty-year bond  yields fell below their 200-day moving
average, indicating this month’s slump in prices that pushed
them to a six-month high may be drawing to a close. The gap in
yields between 10-year notes and Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities fell for a third day as investors bet surging  oil
prices  will weigh on growth rather than fuel inflation. Reports
this week showed slowing in  China  and the euro region.  “We haven’t seen tremendously robust growth in the U.S.
that would counteract negative news out of Europe,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors. “The strong run in yields to the upside made yields
more attractive, and since then there has been the revelation
with weaker data out of  Europe  and China that everything is not
yet all right with the world.”  Yields (USGG10YR)  on  10-year notes  dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.23 percent at 5:15 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They touched 2.21
percent. The 2 percent securities due in February 2022 rose
13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 30/32.  Thirty-year bond  yields slid five basis points today to
3.31 percent and touched 3.30 percent, the lowest since March
14, falling below their 200-day moving average of 3.3343
percent. They rose above the average on March 14.  ‘Signaling a Rejection’  “That the breaking the 200-day moving average didn’t
propel us to sell off further is signaling a rejection of the
rising yield trend,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-
bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“The market has readjusted the range in the recent steep
selloff, and now the market is pausing to reinvestigate.”  Ten-year yields fell six basis points this week, paring
their advance since March 2 to 26 basis points. The drop
reversed a nine-day climb, the longest run of increases since
2006. The yields touched 2.4 percent on March 20, the highest in
almost five months, after the Fed on March 13 raised its
assessment of the economy. The improved outlook reduced bets the
central bank will buy more debt under quantitative easing and
fueled investor appetite for riskier assets.  ‘Ahead of Itself’  “Clearly yields moved on the idea we were closer to the
end of accommodative policy, but that position is ahead of
itself,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at the
broker-dealer BTIG LLC in New York. “Growth concerns are re-
emerging.”  Treasuries extended gains today, pushing 10-year yields to
the lowest since March 14, as the Conference Board said in
Beijing its leading economic index for China rose 0.8 percent
last month to 227.2 in a preliminary reading. That compared with
a 1.5 percent gain in January.  German  10-year bunds  advanced as investors sought safety,
pushing yields down five basis points to 1.87 percent. The  yield
difference  between bunds and 10-year Treasuries matched the
widest since February 2011, 37 basis points.  Bunds and Treasuries rose yesterday as London-based Markit
Economics said in an initial estimate that a euro-area composite
index based on a survey of purchasing managers in services and
manufacturing dropped to 48.7 this month from 49.3 in February.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for
a gain to 49.6. A reading below 50 shows contraction.  Oil Climbs  Crude oil surpassed $108 a barrel for the first time in
four days, with May futures rising as much as 2.5 percent to
$108.25 in  New York , the highest in three weeks. The average
price over the past decade is $65 a barrel.  The yield difference between 10-year TIPS and nominal
notes, which signals the annual rise in consumer prices traders
expect over the next decade, shrank to 2.37 percent. It rose to
2.45 percent on March 20, the highest level since August.  “It’s impossible to stay insulated against any other
slowdown in the rest of the world,” said  Michael Franzese ,
managing director and head of Treasury trading at Wunderlich
Securities Inc. in New York. “That bodes well for bonds.”  Bonds extended gains today after Commerce Department data
showed sales of  new homes  in the U.S. dropped in February for a
second month. They fell 1.6 percent to a 313,000 annual pace,
the slowest since October, from a revised 318,000 rate in
January, department figures showed. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey was for an increase to 325,000.  Volume Falls  Treasury-market  volume  fell for a second day. About $190
billion of Treasuries changed hands through ICAP Plc, the
world’s largest interdealer broker, the least since March 12,
compared with  $260 billion yesterday. The average daily volume
over the past year is $267 billion.  Volatility eased yesterday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
 MOVE (MOVE)  index, which measures Treasury price swings based on
options, fell to 87.1. It reached 93.3 on March 20, the highest
level this year.  The Treasury will auction $99 billion in notes next week:
$35 billion of two-year securities on March 27, the same amount
of five-year debt on the following day and $29 billion of seven-
year notes on March 29. The amounts are the same as the last
time the government sold the securities, in February.  Negative Yield  The U.S. drew a record low  negative yield  yesterday at a
sale of $13 billion of 10-year TIPS. The offering yielded
negative 0.089 percent, the second sale of 10-year inflation-
linked notes in a row at which it was less than zero.  The Fed acquired $1.97 billion in Treasuries today due from
February 2036 to August 2041 as part of its plan to cap
borrowing costs by replacing $400 billion in shorter-term debt
in its holdings with longer-term securities. The operation
concluded five straight days of purchases, the most in a row
since January.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two
rounds of quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011 to
spur growth. It reiterated on March 13 a pledge to keep  interest
rates  at virtually zero through at least late 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
