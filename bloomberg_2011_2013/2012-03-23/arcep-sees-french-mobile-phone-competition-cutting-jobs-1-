French phone companies may
eliminate as many as 10,000 jobs to reduce spending as they
adapt to increased competition from  Iliad SA (ILD) ’s new mobile
service, telecommunications regulator Arcep said.  “If carriers’ sales and margins continue to decrease, they
will have to cut spending,” Arcep President Jean-Ludovic Silicani told journalists at a meeting in Paris today. “There
could be between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs cut” out of an industry
workforce of 130,000 in  France .  Iliad started offering mobile service at discounted prices
in January under the Free brand, competing with  France Telecom
SA (FTE) ’s Orange service, Bouygues Telecom and  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s SFR.
While France’s fourth mobile operator has declined to say how
many subscribers the service has attracted, Silicani has
estimated Free may have gained as many as 2 million customers in
the first two months.  The job cuts don’t “necessarily mean they’ll fire these
people,” Silicani said, adding that posts may be shed by such
measures as not replacing employees who retire for two years.  Vivendi, which began a review of its SFR wireless division
last month, may eliminate hundreds of marketing and
administrative positions to offset a projected slump in earnings
of as much as 570 million euros ($757 million) at the unit, top
union officials said two weeks ago.  Revenue Drop  Bouygues Telecom, a  Bouygues SA (EN)  subsidiary and France’s
third phone company by sales, said last month that cost savings
will partly make up for a negative effect of 250 million euros
on its 2012 earnings due to a drop in revenue. The company plans
to save about 300 million euros as of 2013.  France Telecom is the biggest employer in the industry,
with about 100,000 workers. The former French state-owned phone
monopoly has vowed to maintain its workforce in the country at
about level by 2015 as part of the four-year development plan it
detailed in May 2011.  Vivendi rose as much as 1.3 percent and was up 0.9 percent
at 14.03 euros as of 4:44 p.m. in Paris. Bouygues declined 0.1
percent to 23.26 euros and  France Telecom  stock fell 0.3 percent
to 11.48 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
