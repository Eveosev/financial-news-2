Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-
biggest Swiss bank, cut total compensation for Chief Executive
Officer  Brady Dougan  by 55 percent for 2011 after profit slumped
62 percent.  Dougan’s pay of 5.82 million Swiss francs ($6.37 million)
included fixed salary of 2.5 million francs and 3 million francs
in share awards, the Zurich-based bank said today in its annual
report. The bank paid Dougan 12.8 million francs for 2010.  The highest-paid member on Credit Suisse’s executive board
was asset-management head Robert Shafir with 8.5 million francs.
Antonio Quintella, who heads the Americas region, was the top
paid in 2010, with total compensation of 15.63 million francs.  Credit Suisse said last month that it cut the 2011 bonus
pool by 41 percent after its securities unit posted a second
consecutive quarterly loss, and reduced the average variable
compensation for executive board members 57 percent. The bonus
pool for the investment bank was cut 51 percent, Credit Suisse
said today. The bank’s net income fell to 1.95 billion francs in
2011 from 5.1 billion francs the previous year.  The CEO’s compensation “reflects the lower financial
performance compared to the prior year and the lower share
price, and also recognizes Mr. Dougan’s contribution to the
long-term execution of the strategy and positioning of the firm
in a changing regulatory and industry environment,” the bank
said in its annual report.  Board Compensation  Credit Suisse  shares  fell 42 percent in 2011 in Zurich
trading, outpacing the 32 percent decline by the  Bloomberg
Europe Banks Index (BEBANKS)  in the same period.  UBS AG, the biggest Swiss bank, said earlier this month
that it paid  Sergio Ermotti , who joined the bank in April and
took over as CEO after  Oswald Gruebel  resigned in September,
6.35 million francs. Deutsche Bank AG,  Germany ’s biggest lender,
said this week that CEO  Josef Ackermann  was paid 6.3 million
euros ($8.3 million).  The 13-member Credit Suisse executive board received total
pay of 70.2 million francs, compared with 160.34 million francs
paid to 16 individuals in 2010. Board members didn’t receive any
cash bonuses and their variable compensation was fully deferred
into future years and is subject to clawbacks, it said. Board
members, except for Dougan, Chief Financial Officer  David Mathers , Chief Risk Officer Tobias Guldimann and personnel chief
Pamela Thomas-Graham, will also be getting bonuses in the form
of bonds linked to derivatives.  Toxic Assets  Credit Suisse, which in 2008 awarded employees bonuses
linked to a pool of toxic assets, paid out about 500 million
francs in notes, named Partner Asset Facility 2, to more than
5,500 senior employees throughout the bank. The bonds were
designed to help the bank cut risks and improve its capital
position.  The bank said it would absorb the first $500 million of
losses on the bonds, which will pay a coupon of 5 percent for
franc holders and 6.5 percent in dollars for holders elsewhere.  Chairman Urs Rohner received total compensation of 4.33
million francs, the bank said. Credit Suisse also announced that
Peter Weibel will step down from the board of directors at the
annual  shareholders’ meeting .  To contact the reporter on this story:
