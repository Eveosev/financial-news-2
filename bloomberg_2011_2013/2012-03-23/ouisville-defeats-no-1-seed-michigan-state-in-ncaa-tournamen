Gorgui Dieng had seven blocked
shots as Louisville knocked No. 1 seed Michigan State out in the
West Regional semifinals of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association basketball tournament.  The fourth-seeded Cardinals (29-9), who won the Big East
conference tournament, won 57-44 to make the Spartans (29-8) the
first regional top seed to lose in this yearâ€™s tournament.  Dieng, a 6-foot-11 sophomore center from  Senegal , also had
three steals and nine rebounds in leading a Louisville defense
that held the Spartans to 29 percent shooting.  Draymond Green had 13 points and 16 rebounds for Michigan
State in the game at the US Airways Center in Phoenix.  Louisville will face either Marquette or  Florida  in the
regional final in two days. Cardinals coach Rick Pitino now is
10-0 in Round of 16 games in the NCAA tournament.  In the East Regional, top-seeded Syracuse (34-2) held on
for a 64-63 victory against fourth-seeded Wisconsin (26-10)
at the TD Garden in  Boston  and moved on to face Cincinnati or
Ohio State in the regional final.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
