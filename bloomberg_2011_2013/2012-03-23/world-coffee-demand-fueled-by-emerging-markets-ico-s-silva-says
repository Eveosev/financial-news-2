World coffee demand growth remains
“resilient,” led by  emerging markets , increased consumption in
producing countries, and the expanding popularity of single-cup
dispensers, said Roberio Silva, the executive director of the
London-based International Coffee Organization.  “From what we heard from the industry, consumption has
remained resilient, especially with the emergence of the single-
serve” technology, Silva said today during an interview at an
industry conference in Charleston,  South Carolina .  Low stockpiles of coffee in countries that produce and
import the beans means global supplies remain “tight,” he
said.  Global production will be 128.5 million bags in the season
that started in October, down from the previous forecast of
130.9 million bags, the ICO said on March 1. Consumption in
2010, the most recent data available, was 135 million bags.  To contact the reporter on this story:
