Expansion of single-serve coffee
technology will hurt demand for beans, Paul J. Fisher, the
president of Fisher Waterhouse LLC, said today.  Demand for arabica beans may drop by as much as 5 percent
in the long term as single-serve coffee makers reduce the amount
left unused in a larger pot, Fisher said during an industry
event in Charleston,  South Carolina . Coffee drinkers using drip
machines may make a whole pot, while only having one or two
cups, throwing the rest out and using more beans than they
needed.  With single-serve technology, “there’s no waste,” said
Fisher, who has been in the coffee business for 42 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
