This year marks a century since Japanese cherry trees first bloomed on the
National Mall, in  Washington , DC. Over one million people are expected to attend
the National Cherry Blossom Festival in 2012. Scientists have begun to study the bloom dates of cherry trees as an
indicator of manmade climate change. The " unabated increase " in global
temperatures is leading to an  earlier onset  of spring in many parts of the
world. In Washington, DC, 89 of 100 plants studied showed a  4.5-day advance  in
first flowering between 1970 and 1999, including cherry trees. A  study  last
November in the journal  PLoS One  predicts that by the middle of the
century, peak bloom dates will occur before National Cherry Blossom
Festival. Visit  www.bloomberg.com/sustainability  for the latest from Bloomberg News
