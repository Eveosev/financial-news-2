European Central Bank Executive
Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said officials are not
yet discussing the details of unwinding the central bank’s
crisis measures.  “Discussing in detail, no, because we’re still examining
the effects of the two auctions,” Gonzalez-Paramo told
reporters in Malaga,  Spain , today.  The ECB has loosened its collateral criteria and loaned
banks more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) for three years
to prevent a credit crunch. Gonzalez-Paramo said the measures
had contributed to improving the financial and economic
environment since the start of the year.  There has been a “turning point” in the euro-area crisis,
even as it “remains to be seen if this turns into a decisive
change,” he said.  While banks haven’t stepped up lending as a result of the
extraordinary loans, data suggests they may do so in the coming
months, he said.  “The credit cycle hasn’t changed drastically,” he said.
“But banks are contemplating much more positively their
disposition to offer credit and relax credit standards in the
coming months so we’ll have to see if that materializes.”  The euro-area economy is in a “stabilization moment,” he
said, and the Frankfurt-based ECB is “confident that in the
coming quarters” there will be a recovery.  While rising oil prices are “one of the upside risks” to
 price stability , “inflation expectations for the medium term
remain anchored” in line with the ECB’s definition of price
stability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
