The cost of insuring corporate and
bank debt fell in  Europe , according to credit-default swaps
prices.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps linked to 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 5.5
basis points to 592.5 as of 8:27 a.m. in London, according to
BNP Paribas SA. The gauge had risen each day since a new series
of the index started on March 20.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers dropped 1.5 basis points to 203.5,
snapping three days of increases, while a gauge of subordinated
debt risk fell 3.5 basis points to 319.5, BNP Paribas prices
show.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell 1.5 basis points to 277.5 after climbing for
the past two days.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was unchanged at 117 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter and
