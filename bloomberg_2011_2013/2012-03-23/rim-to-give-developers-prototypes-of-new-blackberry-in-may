Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  plans to
give software developers prototypes for its new BlackBerry
smartphone platform in early May, signaling RIM is a step closer
to debuting a handset it’s betting on to lift sales.  As many as 2,000 of the BlackBerry 10 test models will be
given out to developers at RIM’s BlackBerry Jam conference in
Orlando,  Florida  and they are designed primarily to allow
developers to build applications using the underlying operating
system, Alec Saunders, RIM’s vice-president developer relations,
said in a telephone interview today.  “It’s a huge step forward on our path to eventually
launching BB10,” Saunders said. “It’s tangible evidence of the
company making progress to finally shipping the device.”  RIM is counting on the BlackBerry 10 lineup, based on
software called QNX it bought in 2010, to revive sales that have
slumped in recent quarters, particularly in the U.S., its
biggest and most competitive market. RIM’s market share has
dropped as consumers abandoned the BlackBerry for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhone and touch-screen devices built on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android
software that offer a wider range of consumer apps.  Saunders said the design of the test model and the screen’s
look and navigation will be very different from what eventually
goes on sale to consumers.  “The experience on this device from a consumer’s
perspective is not in any way indicative of what the final
experience on BlackBerry 10 will be like,” he said. “We are
holding that back to create the interest around that at launch
time.”  Generate Buzz  RIM has said the first of the new phones will go on sale in
the “latter” part of 2012, a schedule reiterated today by
Victoria Berry, a company spokeswoman.  Waterloo, Ontario-based  RIM (RIMM)  fell 0.9 percent to $13.66 at 4
p.m. New York time. The stock  fell  75 percent last year and is
down 5.8 percent this year.  RIM is looking to generate buzz with developers who, like
consumers, have drifted away from the BlackBerry platform
because of the lack of a consistent operating system and recent
losses in market share. Eighty-nine percent of developers in a
January  survey  by Appcelerator and IDC said they were “very
interested” in developing for the iPhone. For Android phones,
the figure was 79 percent, while only 16 percent of developers
polled were “very interested” in building apps for the
BlackBerry phone.  Rekindle That Interest  The BlackBerry Jam event, which runs May 1-3 alongside the
larger BlackBerry World Conference in  Orlando , is designed to
bring together developers and RIM’s top software executives,
including Saunders, to rekindle that interest. Every BlackBerry
Jam participant will get a prototype up to the event’s limit of
2,000.  “This is a tool the developer can use to get a jumpstart
to build applications that will be great on a BlackBerry 10
device in the future,” Saunders said.  The BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, which uses an operating
system that is broadly the same as BB10, has about 10,000 apps,
which should port very easily onto the new generation of
smartphones, Saunders said.  “My goal is that every single PlayBook app works on
BB10,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
