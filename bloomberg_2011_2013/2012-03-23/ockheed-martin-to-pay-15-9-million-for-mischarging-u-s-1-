Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the biggest
U.S. defense contractor, will pay $15.9 million to settle
allegations it mischarged the federal government for tools used
on military aircraft.  The settlement arose from a pricing fraud by a Lockheed
subcontractor that began 14 years ago, according to the Justice
Department. Lockheed Martin passed the excessive costs on to the
government in violation of the  False Claims Act , the U.S. said
in a statement.  “It is troubling that a large defense contractor with
long-established contractual ties with the United States failed
to undertake appropriate measures to ensure the integrity and
validity of the costs it submitted to the United States,”
Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the
 Justice Department ’s civil division, said in today’s statement.  The settlement resolves two whistle-blower cases filed in
federal court in Dallas. The whistleblowers will receive $2
million of the proceeds, according to the Justice Department.  Joe Stout, a spokesman for Bethesda, Maryland-based
Lockheed Martin, said the company cooperated with the
government’s investigation into its tool supplier that led to
the conviction of the subcontractor’s president.  The case is U.S. ex rel. Becker v. Tools & Metals Inc., 05-
00627, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
