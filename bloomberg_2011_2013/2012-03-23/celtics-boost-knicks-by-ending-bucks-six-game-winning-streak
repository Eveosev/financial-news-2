The  Boston Celtics  ended
Milwaukee’s six-game winning streak, helping the  New York Knicks 
as they vie with the Bucks for the final playoff spot in the
National Basketball Association’s Eastern Conference.  Paul Pierce had 25 points and nine rebounds, and Kevin Garnett added 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists, as the
Celtics won 100-91 at Milwaukee’s Bradley Center last night.  The Knicks (23-24) are eighth in the Eastern Conference, 1
1/2 games ahead of the Bucks (21-25). The Celtics (25-21) are
seventh in the standings, 12 1/2 games behind the conference-
leading Chicago Bulls.  The Knicks host the Bucks at Madison Square Garden on March
26 and the teams meet again in  Milwaukee  on April 11.  The Knicks have won five straight games since Mike Woodson
took over as interim coach when Mike D’Antoni resigned following
a six-game losing run.  Brandon Jennings had 19 points and Carlos Delfino added 16
points and eight rebounds for the Bucks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
