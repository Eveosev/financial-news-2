Malaysia ’s ringgit was poised for a
third consecutive weekly drop after the central bank cut its
growth forecast for Southeast Asia’s third-biggest economy.  Gross domestic product may rise 4 percent to 5 percent this
year, Bank Negara Malaysia said on March 21, lower than a
prediction of 5 percent to 6 percent the Finance Ministry made
in October and an increase of 5.1 percent in 2011. A preliminary
survey of manufacturing in China, Malaysia’s biggest export
market in December, showed this week that factory output may
have shrunk for a fifth month in March.  “The risk for Malaysia’s economy is from external
factors,” said Saktiandi Supaat, the Singapore-based head of
foreign-exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. “If  China ’s
economy weakens, it will affect Malaysian exports and the
currency market.”  The ringgit weakened 0.7 percent this week to 3.0837 per
dollar as of 9:16 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It advanced 0.2 percent today.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, to 7.72 percent this week. It was up two basis
points today.  Asian currencies advanced today, snapping a three-day drop,
as the People’s Bank of China set the currency’s reference rate
0.2 percent higher at a record 6.2891 per dollar.  Five-year Malaysian  government bonds  were little changed
from a week ago. The yield on the 4.262 percent notes due
September 2016 held at 3.27 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
