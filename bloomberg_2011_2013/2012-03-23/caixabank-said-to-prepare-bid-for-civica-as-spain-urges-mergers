CaixaBank (CABK)  SA,  Spain ’s fourth-
biggest lender, is preparing a bid for Banca Civica SA, said a
person familiar with the situation.  CaixaBank has been studying  Banca Civica’s books  as it
readies an offer, said the person, who declined to elaborate on
the bid and asked not to be identified because the deliberations
are private.  CaixaBank and Banca Civica said in regulatory filings on
March 13 that they were studying plans to combine as part of an
overhaul of the country’s financial industry. Spain’s government
is encouraging more lenders to merge as it requires them to
recognize deeper losses on real estate accumulated during the
property crash.  El Pais newspaper reported today that a CaixaBank share
exchange offer for Civica might value the lender below its
existing share price. Civica shares fell as much as 8 percent
today, and were down 16 cents, or 6.8 percent, to 2.21 euros by
2:12 p.m. in Madrid trading.  A spokesman for Barcelona-based CaixaBank, who asked not to
be named in line with company policy, declined to comment. A
spokeswoman for Madrid-based Civica wasn’t immediately available
for comment when reached by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
