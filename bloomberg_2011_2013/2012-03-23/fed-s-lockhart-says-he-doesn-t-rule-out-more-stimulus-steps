President  Dennis Lockhart  said he favors a monetary policy of
“patient vigilance” and doesn’t rule out the possibility of
more stimulus if the economy falters.  “I want to see how the economy evolves before drawing the
conclusion that more stimulus is needed,” Lockhart said in a
talk with students today at  Georgetown University  in Washington.
“I don’t rule it out. We certainly have the tools to do more if
the Fed or  Federal Open Market Committee  decides that we need
more stimulus.”  Lockhart votes on the Fed’s monetary policy decisions this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
