Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD) ,  Latin America ’s third-
biggest retailer, rose for the first time in five days after
reporting better-than-forecast profit on record sales.  The shares jumped 1.4 percent to 3,180 pesos at 12:45 p.m.
in Santiago after retreating 3 percent in the previous four
days.  Chile ’s benchmark equity index advanced 0.2 percent.  Fourth-quarter net income slid to 108 billion pesos ($221
million) from 110 billion pesos a year ago, according to data on
the Chilean securities regulator’s website, beating a 99.7
billion-peso average estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Sales rose 20 percent to 2.19 trillion pesos, the
highest level since at least 2004 when Bloomberg records begin.  “Numbers were mostly in line with my expectations,
although net income was a little surprising to the upside,”
said Christopher Disalvatore, an analyst at IM Trust SA in
Santiago. “There are some issues with the upcoming share
issuance but fundamentals remain strong.”  Cencosud is preparing to sell as many as 270 million new
shares in Chile and  New York , which at today’s price would raise
$1.75 billion to finance expansions.  Billionaire controller Horst Paulmann resumed a regional
expansion in late 2009 as Chile’s economy recovered from its
steepest slump in a decade. Cencosud forecasts sales of $18
billion this year, from $15 billion last year, and budgeted $1.3
billion for expansion, according to a Feb. 10 statement.  Santiago-based Cencosud is the third-biggest retailer in
Latin America by sales after  Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB  and  Brazil ’s
 Cia Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
