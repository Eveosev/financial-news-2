Cosmo Oil Co. (5007)  is preparing to start
the No. 2 crude-distillation unit at its refinery in Chiba,
according to a company statement.  Production is to resume at the 120,000 barrel-a-day unit
after safety approvals by prefectural officials, the statement
on the company’s website today showed. It didn’t give a start
date for the unit, which was idled after being damaged in a fire
and explosion during the March 11, 2011 earthquake.  The unit will be idled for maintenance from late April
until the beginning of June, a company official said last month.  Cosmo is waiting for safety measures and inspections to be
completed at the plant’s 100,000 barrel-a-day No. 1 crude unit
before it begins preparing for its resumption as well, the
company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
