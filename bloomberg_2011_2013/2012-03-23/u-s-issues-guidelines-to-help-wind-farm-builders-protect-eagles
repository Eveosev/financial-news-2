The U.S. Interior Department
released guidelines today aimed at helping wind-farm developers
comply with laws that protect eagles, bats and other wildlife
from spinning turbine blades.  Developers such as  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  and  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) 
that follow the guidelines will face less scrutiny from federal
regulators, said Dan Ashe, director of the departments Fish and
Wildlife Service.  “Companies that follow the guidelines will not be a
priority in terms of our law-enforcement efforts,” Ashe said
today on a conference call with Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar .
“This is as much of a safe harbor as a developer can get under
the law.”  About 440,000 birds die annually from colliding with wind
turbines, the Fish and Wildlife Service estimates.  Wind farm developers installed 6,810 megawatts of turbines
in the U.S. last year, 31 percent more than in 2010, as they
rushed to qualify for a federal-tax grant that expired last
month, according to the Washington-based  American Wind Energy
Association .  The  guidelines  announced today will help expedite the
permitting process. They include recommendations about where
developers may build wind farms, how to mitigate harm to
protected species. It calls for wind-farm operators to monitor
and report wildlife fatalities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
