Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , Canada’s
largest insurer, reduced  Chief Executive Officer Donald Guloien’s compensation by 7.7 percent for 2011, a year in which
the shares fell by more than a third.  Guloien received C$8.1 million ($8.1 million) in salary,
share-based awards, option-based awards, incentive plans and
other compensation, the Toronto-based insurer disclosed in a
filing to securities regulators today. That compares with
C$8.78 million a year ago. Both figures exclude costs to service
his pension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
