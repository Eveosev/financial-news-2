What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that a smaller crop
in  South America  and reduced palm-oil output in  Malaysia  will
increase demand for supplies from the U.S.,  Mark Schultz , the
chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
 Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.  Soybean-oil  futures
are expected to open 0.7 cent to 0.8 cent a pound higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as dry weather will reduce production in Spain,
Italy and  France  and may move north and west in April,
increasing demand for U.S. wheat supplies, Schultz said.  -- Corn futures are called to open up 4 cents to 5 cents a
bushel in  Chicago  on speculation that  China , the biggest grower
after the U.S., will boost imports to cool inflation after
domestic grain prices surged, Schultz said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
