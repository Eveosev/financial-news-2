Spanish Deputy Prime Minister
Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said the Cabinet examined the draft
of a transparency law that will seek to punish politicians who
overspend.  “The law will complement the law on budget stability so
that Spanish public administrations meet their pledges, manage
public funds responsibly and transparently,” Saenz said at a
news conference in Madrid today after the Cabinet meeting.  The new rules will increase the local administrations’
credibility in  Spain  and abroad, Saenz said. Spain missed its
2011 budget-deficit target by 2.5 percentage points mainly due
to regional governments’ overspending.  The law will make senior officials personally responsible
and liable for sanctions when budget rules aren’t respected, for
example if surpluses aren’t used to reduce debt, Saenz said.  Sanctions include being barred from occupying certain
public positions for a period of five to 10 years, Saenz said.  The transparency law will also increase citizens’ access to
official documents and records so that information on subsidies,
the cost of public events or the wages of officials, public
contracts, spending and other government reports is made more
widely available, Saenz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
