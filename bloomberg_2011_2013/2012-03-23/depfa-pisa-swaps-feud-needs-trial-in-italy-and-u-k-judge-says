A  London  judge ruled that a dispute
between  Depfa Bank PLC,  (DEP) Dexia SA and the Italian province of
Pisa over a swaps deal needs separate trials in Italy and the
U.K.  While the banks had asked the judge to refer the case to a
 European Court  for a final ruling on jurisdiction, Judge Nigel Teare refused the request, saying proceedings in the two
countries were different.  The case is one of several being fought over derivatives
used to hedge  interest rates  sold to European regional
governments by investment banks that turned out to be far more
costly than predicted.  Dexia and Depfa filed a lawsuit in London in 2009 seeking a
ruling that the swaps are valid. Pisa wants an Italian court to
approve its decision to annul them, according to Teare’s
judgment.  “The proceedings are different and the administrative
matters must be heard in  Italy ,” Pisa lawyer Germana Lo Iacono-
Smith said in a phone interview.  Benoit Gausseron at Dexia in Paris didn’t immediately
respond to a phonecall requesting comment. A call to the press
room of Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, Depfa’s parent company,
wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
