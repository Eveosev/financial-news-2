The bankrupt Los Angeles Dodgers
baseball team are seeking dismissal of Jamie McCourt’s $131
million claim, saying owner  Frank McCourt  must pay his ex-wife.  The McCourts signed a divorce settlement requiring Frank to
give Jamie $131 million by April 30 or sell team assets to make
the payment, according to court records. Since the team isn’t a
party to the settlement, it cannot be forced to pay Jamie, the
Dodgers said in a filing yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Wilmington.  “It is anticipated that Ms. McCourt will be paid by Mr.
McCourt from any distribution,” from a sale of the team, the
Dodgers said.  Frank McCourt agreed to sell the Dodgers after months of
legal battles with  Major League Baseball ,  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox
Sports, which televises the team’s games, and Jamie McCourt. The
team may sell for more than $1 billion, it said in a court
filing last year. The sale is required to be completed by the
end of April.  Laura Davis Jones, a lawyer for Jamie McCourt, didn’t
immediately return a call for comment yesterday on the filing.
Jamie McCourt had filed a so-called proof of claim in the
bankruptcy case, demanding that the team pay her $131 million.  The case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-12010, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
