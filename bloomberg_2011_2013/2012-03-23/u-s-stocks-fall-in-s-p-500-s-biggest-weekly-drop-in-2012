U.S. stocks  retreated this week,
with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index having its biggest decline
since December, amid weaker-than-estimated housing data and
reports showing manufacturing contracted in Europe and  China .  Stocks rose on March 23 as a jump in  oil prices  lifted
energy shares. The rally failed to help the industry avoid
posting the worst performance for the week among the  S&P 500 ’s
10 groups, falling 3 percent as  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  slumped 11
percent. The Dow Jones Transportation Average lost 2.5 percent,
the most since Nov. 25, as FedEx Corp. tumbled amid a
disappointing earnings forecast.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  advanced 1.8 percent
after announcing its first dividend in 17 years.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.5 percent to 1,397.11 after rallying
in 10 out of 11 weeks this year. The benchmark index is still up
2.3 percent for March and has risen for four straight months,
poised for its longest string of monthly gains since September
2009. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 151.89 points, or
1.2 percent, to 13,080.73 after reaching its highest level since
December 2007 on March 15.  “We’ve had a tremendous run in the market, so it doesn’t
take much in terms of a slightly negative indicator or two to
make investors contemplate taking some of the profits,” Peter Tuz, who helps manage $750 million as president of Chase
Investment Counsel Corp. in Charlottesville,  Virginia , said in a
phone interview. “There was too much complacency in the market,
and that’s why some of the data caught people by surprise.”  Economic Slowdown  Equities declined amid concerns of a global economic
slowdown as a Chinese manufacturing index indicated a worse
contraction this month while euro-area services and
manufacturing output shrank more than forecast. In the U.S., new
home sales fell for a second month in February and purchases of
previously owned houses missed economists’ expectations. The
labor market continues to show signs of improvement, with
jobless claims dropping to the lowest level in four years.  About $3.5 trillion has been restored to American equity
values as the  S&P 500 (SPX)  rallied 27 percent from an October low
amid better-than-expected earnings and economic data. The S&P
500 closed at the highest level since May 2008 on March 19,
while the  S&P SmallCap 600 Index (SML)  reached a record and the Nasdaq
Composite Index rallied to an 11-year high that day.  Shares fell in the following three days as concern about
the global economy grew. Energy companies in the S&P declined
more than any other industries during the week, sinking 3
percent.  Baker Hughes (BHI) , the world’s third-largest oilfield-
services provider, tumbled 11 percent to $43.71 after saying
that a shift away from gas rigs will hurt earnings.  ‘Dubious Value’  Rowan Cos., (RDC)  an offshore-drilling contractor, slid 9.5
percent to $33.52. Former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
C. Robert Palmer said he’s “greatly disappointed by and
concerned with” the company’s management. Rowan’s plan to move
its legal headquarters to the United Kingdom is “of dubious
value” because it will increase costs, he wrote in a letter to
shareholders.  Industrial companies were the  second-worst  performing group
in the S&P 500, falling 2.1 percent.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the
biggest maker of construction and mining equipment, tumbled 5.1
percent to $107.83 as BHP Billiton Ltd. said China’s steel
production is slowing.  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , a maker of
Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters, dropped
4.3 percent to $81.80.  An index tracking 11 U.S. homebuilders slumped 4.2 percent
this week as the decrease in home sales signaled that the
recovery in the housing market may be uneven. The group surged
86 percent from Oct. 3 to March 16.  KB Home, the Los Angeles-based homebuilder that targets
first-time buyers, plunged 19 percent to $10.29 after it
reported a decline in orders.  FedEx, Apple  FedEx fell 2.1 percent to $92.38. The largest cargo airline
forecast a profit range for its current fiscal quarter whose low
end trailed analysts’ estimates amid slowing express-shipment
demand.  Apple climbed 1.8 percent to $596.05, helping drive the
Nasdaq to the sixth straight weekly gain. The world’s largest
technology company announced a quarterly dividend of $2.65 a
share and said it will buy back $10 billion of its stock.  Shares of Apple were briefly halted on March 23 amid a
system error on  Bats Global Markets Inc. (BATS)  that caused incorrect
price quotes. Bats, the six-year-old equity exchange, canceled
its initial public offering after the computer malfunctions
derailed trading in the company’s own market debut.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  slid 3.5 percent to $23.63. The company
will combine its personal-computer unit with the division that
sells printers into a group led by  Todd Bradley , who ran the PC
business, to help cut expenses amid declining sales and profit.  ‘Deeper Issues’  “Deeper issues will likely take more than management
changes,” Maynard Um, an analyst with UBS AG in  New York , said
in a March 21 note to investors.  Sears Holdings Corp. dropped for the first time in six
weeks, ending its longest string of weekly gains since 2004. The
shares fell 12 percent to $72.36 for the biggest decline in the
S&P 500. The retailer controlled by hedge-fund owner  Edward Lampert  faces “weaker” cash flow in 2013,  Gary Balter , an
analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a March 19 note.
The stock surged 87 percent in the previous seven weeks after
Sears announced plans to close stores and spin off units to
generate cash.  Western Digital Corp. (WDC)  rose the most in the S&P 500, jumping
11 percent to $42.44. The maker of disk drives and networking
products was raised to strong buy from buy at Needham & Co.,
meaning it is expected to have a total return of at least 25
percent over the next 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
