Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT)  and
 Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  fell in Mumbai on concern demand and
prices of aluminum and copper may decline as  China , the world’s
biggest base-metals buyer, reins in stimulus measures.  Sterlite, the nation’s largest copper producer, declined as
much as 3.4 percent, the most since March 26, to 106.85 rupees
and traded at 107.30 rupees as of 11:19 a.m. in Mumbai.
Hindalco,  India ’s second-largest aluminum maker, fell as much as
4.3 percent, the most since March 6, to 127.40 rupees and traded
at 128.1 rupees.  China’s inflation accelerated more than forecast in March
on a pickup in food prices, signaling that policy makers may
exercise caution in adding stimulus to boost growth. Consumer
prices rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier, the National Bureau
of Statistics said today, more than the median 3.4 percent
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 33 economists. Food-
related costs gained 7.5 percent.  “Inflation is again sticking out its neck and that’s not
good news for  emerging markets  like China and India, which
follow similar trends,” said Ameya Hardas, research head at
Shah Investor’s Home Ltd. in Mumbai. “Later this week China is
also likely to report a slower growth, which is severely
impacting investor sentiment.”  China’s economy  probably grew 8.4 percent in the first
quarter, according to the median estimate of 38 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. That compares with 8.9 percent in the
fourth quarter, which was the slowest in 10 quarters. The
customs department is set to issue provisional trade data for
commodities tomorrow.  India’s  Supreme Court  will today hear a Sterlite petition
challenging the government’s Aug. 24, 2010 decision to halt
bauxite mining in the eastern state of Odisha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
