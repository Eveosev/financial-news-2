Ukraine’s currency market was
balanced last month as public demand for dollars declined, the
central bank said.  Dollar-demand by households was a quarter of what it was in
March last year, Olena Shcherbakova, who heads the  Natsionalnyi
Bank Ukrainy ’s monetary policy department, said today in a
statement on the bank’s website. There were no dollar sales to
support the hryvnia, she added.  “The market is quiet, participation of the central bank is
nearing zero,” Shcherbakova said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
