Strauss Group Ltd. (STRS)  and  Osem
Investments Ltd. (OSEM) , Israeli food producers, dropped the most in
almost two weeks on speculation lower sales during the Passover
week and protests over food prices will erode earnings.  Strauss  declined  0.9 percent, the most since March 29, to
45.74 shekels at the close in Tel Aviv. Osem declined 1.4
percent, the largest retreat since March 28, to 56.56 shekels.  Local food stores reported weaker sales during the Passover
holiday that started April 6 as consumers preferred to buy
cheaper products amid signs of an economic slowdown, TheMarker
reported. Protests since July against rising prices, from
housing to cottage cheese, have spurred Israeli policy makers to
zero in on measures to reduce the cost of living. Food
manufacturers and supermarkets have cut prices in response to
the demonstrations.  “There are concerns that as we get into summer we will see
a renewal of consumer protests, which will put pressure on the
prices and sales of food makers,” said Gil Dattner, an analyst
at Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. in  Tel Aviv . “This comes in
addition to a weaker economic environment.”  Economic growth probably will slow to 3.1 percent this
year, the central bank said on March 26, from 4.7 percent in
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
