Mexico ’s peso bonds rallied the most
in four months as slower-than-forecast inflation in March added
to speculation that policy makers will cut benchmark borrowing
costs for the first time since 2009.  The yield on Mexico’s fixed-rate peso-denominated debt due
in December 2013 fell 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point,
to 4.57 percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the biggest daily yield decline
since Nov. 30. The price rose 0.22 centavo to 105.58 centavos
per peso.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.73 percent from 3.87 percent
in February, the national statistics institute said today.
Economists predicted inflation of 3.76 percent, according to the
median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The inflation report “could give support to the half of
the board that leans towards easing,”  Eduardo Suarez , a senior
currency strategist at Scotia Capital Inc., said in a telephone
interview from Toronto. “Lower inflation means lower nominal
rates.”  The central bank said in the minutes of its March 16 rate
meeting that it would consider lowering borrowing costs if
inflation remained in check.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 12.9712 per dollar, from
12.9842 on April 6. The currency is the biggest gainer among
major currencies this year, having advanced 7.4 percent.  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated debt due in 2024
fell 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 6.37 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
