(Corrects first and third paragraphs to show 30 shipments
have been halted since January, not in March.)  The U.S.  Food and Drug
Administration  has detained 30 orange-juice shipments since
January after samples tested positive for a banned fungicide.  The FDA made the announcement in a monthly update on April
5 on its website. The agency said it has tested 144 shipments.
As of March 1, 27 shipments had been halted.  Fourteen of the shipments halted were from Brazil, 12 were
from Canada, two were from  Costa Rica  and one each was from the
Dominican Republic and Poland.  Since January, the agency has been testing imports and
domestic supplies for carbendazim, which has been linked to
liver tumors in animals.  Brazil is the worldâ€™s largest citrus producer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
