A missile launch by  North Korea 
would be a “very provocative act” that indicates the country’s
leaders aren’t serious about meeting international obligations,
President Barack Obama’s spokesman said.  The U.S. is working with other nations, particularly  China ,
to keep up pressure on North Korea, White House press secretary
 Jay Carney  said at a briefing today in Washington.  A planned missile launch this month by North Korea is
raising regional tensions the most since Kim Jong Un in December
succeeded his father as head of the totalitarian state. South
Korea warned that North Korea may test a nuclear weapon
following the missile firing, as it did in 2009.  The Obama administration has said firing the long-range
rocket would breach a February agreement to halt nuclear and
missile tests and end uranium enrichment at its facility in
Yongbyon in exchange for 240,000 tons of food aid. Kim’s
government contends putting a “peaceful” satellite into orbit
doesn’t violate the deal.  North Korea may be using the threat of a nuclear test as a
bargaining chip to keep the deal from falling apart, said Koh Yu Hwan, a professor of North Korean Studies at  Dongguk University 
in Seoul.  The launch may take place between April 12 and 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
