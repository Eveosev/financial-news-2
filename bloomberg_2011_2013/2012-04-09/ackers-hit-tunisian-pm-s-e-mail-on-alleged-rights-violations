A group that claimed to be linked to
hacker group Anonymous said it obtained over 2,700 e-mails
belonging to  Tunisia ’s prime minister in protest against attacks
on demonstrators.  “We have kept a large part of the Tunisian government’s
data secret. If the government will not respect human rights and
the freedom of expression in Tunisia, we will publish these
secrets on the Internet,” a masked individual who claimed to be
with the group said in Web video posted on the Facebook page,
Anonymous TN. It was unclear when the video was posted.  “We are trying to verify the authenticity of the news and
the video and we will study the topic morally, and legally, and
issue a statement tomorrow,” Ridha Kosdoghli, spokesman for
Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali, said in a phone interview today.  The individual on the video said the hacking was a protest
against the government’s failure to protect artists who were
attacked by Salafis last month, as well as attacks by security
forces on unemployed demonstrators over the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story: Tarek El-Tablawy in Cairo
