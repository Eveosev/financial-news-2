The  European Central Bank ’s
 financing  for Portuguese lenders rose to a record in March, the
Bank of  Portugal  said.  ECB  financing  climbed to 56.3 billion euros ($74 billion)
from 47.6 billion euros in February, the Bank of Portugal said
today on the BPStat portion of its website. ECB financing
previously peaked at 49.1 billion euros in August 2010.  In April last year, Portugal became the third euro-area
country after Greece and Ireland to require aid and will receive
78 billion euros under its agreement with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union. The aid plan earmarks 12
billion euros for Portugal’s lenders, if needed.  As part of the plan, those lenders were required to raise
core Tier 1 capital ratios to 9 percent by the end of 2011 and
10 percent by the end of 2012.  The Frankfurt-based ECB awarded 529.5 billion euros to 800
financial institutions, it said on Feb. 29. The central bank’s
second round of three-year loans was designed to avert credit
paralysis and ease concern that  Europe ’s banks would run out of
cash or curb lending as the region’s sovereign-debt crisis drove
up borrowing costs.  Ricardo Salgado, the chief executive officer of  Banco
Espirito Santo SA (BES) , Portugal’s biggest publicly traded lender by
market value, said March 6 that the bank obtained 5 billion
euros of three-year ECB loans. The same day, Fernando Ulrich,
the CEO of  Banco BPI SA (BPI) , the country’s fifth-biggest bank,
applied for 2 billion euros of three-year loans.  European lenders tapped the ECB for 489 billion euros in
the first longer-term refinancing operation in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
