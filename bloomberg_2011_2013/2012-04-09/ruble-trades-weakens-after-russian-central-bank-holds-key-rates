The ruble depreciated against the
dollar for a second day and yields on  Russia ’s local-currency
debt rose as oil, the country’s chief export, dropped in New
York and Bank Rossii left rates unchanged.  The Russian currency declined 0.3 percent to 29.6775 per
dollar as of 4:48 p.m. Moscow, after losing 0.5 percent last
week. Russia’s 114 billion rubles ($3.8 billion) of local OFZ
bonds due 2021 fell for a fourth day, increasing the yield six
basis points to 7.96 percent.  Bank Rossii kept the  refinancing rate  at 8 percent,
refraining from cutting it and other key rates for a fourth
month at today’s meeting, even after the inflation rate fell to
the lowest in two decades. The slower price growth is a “short-
term” tendency, the central bank said.  The ruble saw its third consecutive week of declines last
week after a report showed U.S. employers added the fewest jobs
in five months in March and less than forecast, signaling a
recovery in the world’s largest economy may be stalling. Crude
futures dropped 1.5 percent to $101.77 per barrel in  New York 
after  Iran  agreed to resume talks on its nuclear program, which
may ease pressure on the country’s oil exports.  Most Western European markets are closed for a second day
today for Easter holidays.  The ruble was 0.2 percent weaker at 38.79 per euro and lost
0.3 percent to 33.7767 against the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket. Investors increased bets on the currency
depreciating, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
30.0275 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 29.843 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
