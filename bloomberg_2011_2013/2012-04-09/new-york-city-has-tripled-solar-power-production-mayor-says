New York City  has tripled its
production of solar power by completing the installation of
panels on city-owned buildings across the five boroughs, Mayor
Michael Bloomberg said.  The 10 projects increase the city’s total solar production
to 648 kilowatts –- enough to power 143 households –- and will
cut 205 metric tons of carbon emissions, Bloomberg said today in
a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
