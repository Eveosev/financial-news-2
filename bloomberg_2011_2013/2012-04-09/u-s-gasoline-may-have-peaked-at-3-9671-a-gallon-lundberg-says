The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations increased 3.74 cents over the
past two weeks and may have peaked, according to  Trilby Lundberg , the president of  Lundberg Survey Inc .  The price jump to $3.9671 a gallon covers the period ended
April 6 and is based on the Camarillo, California-based
company’s survey of about 2,500 stations.  “Price hikes at the pump have been losing steam for
weeks,” Lundberg said yesterday in a telephone interview.
“Crude  oil prices  have slipped and if they don’t rebound in the
very near future, gasoline prices will peak very soon, if they
haven’t already.”  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed was in Chicago, where the average was $4.45 a
gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Tulsa,  Oklahoma ,
where customers paid an average of $3.66.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline was $4.14 a gallon, while
Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $4.27, according to
Lundberg.  “The price spikes had been led by places like Chicago and
 Los Angeles ,” Lundberg said. “Now, we see some of these prices
tumbling.”  Gasoline on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell 1.3
percent to $3.3405 a gallon in the two weeks ended April 5.  Crude Prices  “Compared to the magnitude of recent price spikes, this is
small,” Lundberg said. The increase was the smallest rise for
the motor fuel since the two weeks between Jan. 6 and Jan. 20,
according to Lundberg Survey. A decline in U.S. oil prices over
the past two weeks has helped, she said.  The front-month crude contract on the Nymex fell $3.56 to
$103.31 a barrel during that period, while Brent oil in  London 
declined $1.70 to $123.43. Nymex trading was closed April 6 for
the Good Friday holiday.  Gasoline futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange have
climbed 24 percent this year, the best performance in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities.  Prices had surged on speculation that refinery closings
would tighten supplies and as crude rose on concern that
tensions with Iran over its nuclear program would reduce oil
supplies. New York-traded West Texas Intermediate crude is up
4.5 percent in 2012, and Brent oil on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange has gained 15 percent.  Summer Driving Season  With the U.S. jobs market and manufacturing showing
improvement, higher pump prices before the peak summer driving
season have become an issue in the 2012  U.S. presidential
election . The Obama administration has said it’s monitoring
prices in 360 U.S. cities to guard against fraud or price
manipulation.  The  U.S. Senate  rejected a Democratic bill to repeal about
$24 billion in tax breaks to  oil companies  on March 29.
Republicans have proposed legislation to deal with rising U.S.
gas prices by studying the effect of environmental rules.  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  fell 1.46 million barrels to a 10-
week low of 221.9 million in the week ended March 30, according
to Energy Department data. Gasoline demand over the prior four
weeks was 3.8 percent below a year earlier.  Consumption Eases  Retail consumption this year through March 30 was 5.6
percent lower than the same period in 2011, according to
 MasterCard Inc. (MA) ’s SpendingPulse report on April 3. Fuel use over
the previous four weeks was 5.9 percent lower than a year
earlier, a record 54th consecutive decline.  Oil may decrease this week after the  Federal Reserve 
signaled it may refrain from more monetary stimulus and U.S.
inventories surged the most since 2008, a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Sixteen of 30 analysts, or 57 percent, forecast oil will
fall through April. Five respondents, or 18 percent, predicted
prices will rise and seven estimated there will be little
change. Last week, 62 percent expected a decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
