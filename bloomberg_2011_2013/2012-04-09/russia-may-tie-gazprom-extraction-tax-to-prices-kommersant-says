The Russian government may link OAO
Gazprom’s mineral extraction tax rate to gas prices,  Kommersant 
reported, citing Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.  If the plan is adopted, the state will get as much as 80
percent of Gazprom’s additional income from rising prices,
starting from July, 2013; that could mean 50 billion rubles
($1.7 billion) of extra tax revenue in the second half of next
year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
