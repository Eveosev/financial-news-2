Ukraineâ€™s spring crop planting is
behind this time last year, researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  As of April 6, plantings were on 1.73 million hectares
(4.27 million acres) compared with 1.8 million hectares a year
earlier, UkrAgroConsult said. The five-year average is about 2.3
million hectares, it said.  The winter wheat plantings are 163,000 hectares and barley
is 1.24 million hectares, the researcher said.  Sunflowers cover 8,000 hectares, compared with 28,000
hectares a year ago, the Kiev-based researcher said, keeping its
forecast that 5.5 million hectares will be planted.  To contact the reporters on this story:
