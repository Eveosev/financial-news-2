Turkish yields rose and the lira
erased its losses after industrial production increased more
than expected in February.  Yields (BENCH)  on two-year benchmark bonds climbed four basis
points, 0.04 percentage point, to 9.36 percent at 10:04 a.m. in
Istanbul. The lira erased losses as much as 0.3 percent and
traded little changed at 1.7960 per dollar.  Industrial production  increased 4.4 percent in February
from a year earlier,  Turkey ’s statistics agency in Ankara said
today. Growth in output accelerated from 1.5 percent in January,
the agency said on its website today. It was forecast at 1.6
percent in a Bloomberg survey of five economists. Production
climbed 1.6 percent from a year earlier when adjusted for the
number of working days, and 0.7 percent from the previous month,
the agency said.  “The central bank will continue to be flexible according
to the moves of exchange rates and  oil prices  and keep the
tightening option on the markets’ agenda,”  Inan Demir , chief
economist at Finansbank AS in Istanbul, said in e-mailed
comments.  Turkey may take more steps to tighten monetary policy amid
concerns that commodity price fluctuations will boost inflation,
Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci said April 7. Basci introduced
a dual interest rates policy in October that allows him to lend
to banks at a high or low point in a so-called interest rates
“corridor,” which varies between 5.75 percent and 11.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
