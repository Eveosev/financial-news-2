Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 0.2 percent to 60,813.25 at the close in Istanbul,
declining for a fourth day to the lowest since March 13.  The following stocks were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Kiler Alisveris Hizmetleri Gida Sanayi & Ticaret AS (KILER)  , a discount retailer, added 3.5 percent to 3.58 liras,
closing at its highest since Oct. 31, after Haberturk newspaper
reported owner Kiler Holding AS may offer a stake in the company
for sale.  Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL)  , Turkey’s largest listed
media group, fell 1.2 percent to 82 kurus after reporting a 2011
loss of 1.2 billion liras ($667 million). Ekspres Invest
downgraded the shares to marketperform, the equivalent of hold,
saying although the company was likely to turn a profit this
year for the first time since 2007, the stock’s 64 percent gain
on the year gives limited room for any upside.  To contact the reporter on this story:
