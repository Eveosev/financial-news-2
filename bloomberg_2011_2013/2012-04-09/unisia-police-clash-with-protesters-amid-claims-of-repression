Tunisian police fired tear gas and
used electric batons to disperse a rally of thousands in the
country’s capital today, leaving dozens injured in unrest that
spotlighted persisting tensions in the Arab Spring’s birthplace.  Thousands gathered in an attempt to march on Tunis’s
central Bourguiba Avenue for a Martyrs Day event honoring those
killed by French troops in 1938.  Tunisia ’s  Interior Ministry 
last month banned demonstrations on the thoroughfare amid
complaints by businesses that they were a disruption. Dozens
were wounded or suffered respiratory problems from the tear gas.
The government has not issued a statement about the events.  “The Interior Ministry is carrying on the same repressive
policies that we lived under during the former regime” of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, said Tarek Asoudi, 35, in an interview at
the protest.  The march reflects the challenges for Tunisia’s new
Islamist-led government, after an uprising last year that
triggered a wave of similar revolts in the Arab world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
