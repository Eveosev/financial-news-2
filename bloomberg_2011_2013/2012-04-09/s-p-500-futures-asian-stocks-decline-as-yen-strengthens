(Corrects to remove reference to Swiss franc breaching
SNB ceiling in 11th paragraph.)  U.S. stocks fell, extending losses
from the  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index’s worst week of 2012, while
yields on 10-year Treasuries slipped and gold rose as job
creation in the world’s biggest economy trailed estimates.  The S&P 500 lost 1.1 percent to 1,382.20 at 4 p.m. New York
time. Treasury 10-year yields slipped as much as four basis
points to a one-month low of 2.02 percent. Gold futures added
0.8 percent to $1,643.90 an ounce. The euro reversed losses,
climbing 0.1 percent to $1.3113. Copper futures slumped to the
lowest level since Feb. 17.  U.S. employers added 85,000 fewer jobs in March than
economists projected, the biggest shortfall since the report
released on July 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Labor Department’s April 6 statement spurred concern about the
pace of American growth after improving economic data helped
fuel a 12 percent first-quarter rally in the  S&P 500 (SPX) , the best
annual start since 1998. The index lost 0.7 percent last week.  “The economy does continue to grow, but slowly,” John Carey, who helps oversee about $220 billion at Pioneer
Investments in Boston, said in a telephone interview. “That’s
been the source of frustration for a lot of investors, that we
haven’t had the big forward movement in the economy like we have
in the past.”  All western European stock markets were shut for holidays,
along with Australia,  New Zealand ,  Hong Kong , Thailand and  South
Africa . U.S. markets were closed on April 6, when the monthly
report from the Labor Department was released. The  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares in the region fell 0.6 percent today.  Overcoming Jobs  The U.S. jobs report presents a challenge that stocks have
overcome nine times during the bull market that drove the  S&P
500  up more than 100 percent in three years. While the S&P 500
averaged losses of 0.8 percent in the day after the data missed
projections by at least 85,000 since March 2009, the benchmark
gauge cut its decline in half a week later and was up 0.9
percent after two weeks, the data show.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  slipped 0.3 percent. The aluminum producer is
scheduled to disclose first-quarter results tomorrow, the first
Dow Jones Industrial Average company to report.  AOL Inc. (AOL)  surged
43 percent, the most since it was spun off from Time Warner Inc.
in 2009, after agreeing to sell and license patents to Microsoft
Corp. in a deal valued at $1.06 billion.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.9 percent. China’s
consumer prices rose 3.6 percent in March from a year earlier,
the government said. That compared with the 3.4 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists and a 3.2 percent
gain the previous month. The one-year swap rate rose five basis
points to 3.195 percent.  ‘High and Disappointing’  “The CPI number is very high and disappointing,” said  Ju Wang , a rates strategist at Barclays Plc in Singapore. “It’s
bad for sentiment as it may delay a reserve requirement cut.”
Barclays has predicted a reduction this month.  Treasuries rose, driving yields lower, as investors sought
the safety of U.S. debt amid concern about the economy.
Investors prepared to bid at three sales of coupon-bearing debt
totaling $66 billion starting tomorrow.  While gold futures advanced, the S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw
materials retreated 0.6 percent. Copper in  New York  fell to
$3.705 a pound, the lowest level since Feb. 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
