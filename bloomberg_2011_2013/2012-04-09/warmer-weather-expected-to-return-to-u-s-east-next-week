Warmer weather may return to the
eastern U.S. next week as high temperatures climb into the 70s
from Chicago to  New York City .  Temperatures may rise 8 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 to
7.8 Celsius) above normal throughout the East from April 14 to
April 18, said MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  Chicago may be 10 degrees above normal from April 15 to
April 19, according to  David Salmon , owner of Weather
Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  Commodities traders watch temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use
gas for hearing, according to the Energy Department. Natural gas
prices fell 30 percent this year through last week on a surplus
caused in part by a warm winter.  April began colder for much of the East after an abnormally
warm March. Across the U.S., 15,292 high temperature records
were broken or tied last month, according to a report released
today by the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  The first three months of 2012 have been the warmest on
record in the contiguous U.S., NOAA said.  The warmer weather is expected to continue in the East from
April 19 to April 23, according to an 11- to 15-day forecast
from MDA. The rest of the U.S. will be more seasonal.  The normal average temperature for April 11 in  New York  is
about 51, according to MDA. Itâ€™s 47 in Boston, 46 in Chicago, 56
in  St. Louis , 61 in Atlanta, 64 in Dallas, 68 in Houston, 50 in
Seattle and 61 in Burbank,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
