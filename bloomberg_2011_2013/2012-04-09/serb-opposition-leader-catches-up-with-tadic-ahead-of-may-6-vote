Serbia’s incumbent President  Boris Tadic , who is running for his third term in office, will
probably face tough competition as opposition leader  Tomislav
Nikolic  is gaining public support before the May 6 elections.  Tadic, the leader of the  Democratic Party , was backed by
35.8 percent of voters and his main challenger, Nikolic, the
leader of the Serbian Progressive Party by 35.7 percent, in an
opinion survey by the pollster Faktor Plus, its manager Vladimir
Pejic said at a news conference in Belgrade today.  The poll indicated 29.4 percent support for the Democrats
and 33.4 percent for the opposition Progressives, almost
unchanged from the previous survey released on March 26, Pejic
said.  The survey 1,160 respondents was carried out in the week
starting April 2,. There was a 3 percent margin of error.  Tadic stepped down on April 4 to ensure that presidential
elections are held on the same day with the vote for parliament
and local governments in a move that may help his party return
to power.  The poll did not indicate ratings for new presidential
candidates, including Jadranka Seselj, wife of Vojislav Seselj,
the leader of the Serbian Radical Party, who is standing trial
at the Hague war crimes tribunal.  Nikolic used to be Seselj’s deputy until 2008, just months
after Tadic defeated him for the second time in presidential
elections. Nikolic set up his own party in later that year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
