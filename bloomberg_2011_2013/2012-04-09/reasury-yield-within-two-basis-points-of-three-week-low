Treasuries held gains after last
week’s biggest rally this year as economists predicted U.S.
government reports will show consumer and producer prices grew
at a slower pace in March.  Benchmark 10-year yields were within two basis points of
the lowest level in three weeks after the Labor Department said
April 6 that the U.S. added 120,000 jobs in March, versus
205,000 projected by a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
Federal funds futures contracts indicate traders are paring bets
for the U.S. central bank to raise  interest rates  before its
target date of at least late 2014.  “Treasury yields should stay very low,” said Hajime Nagata, an investor in  Tokyo  at Diam Co., which manages the
equivalent of $121.6 billion and is an arm of Dai-ichi Life
Insurance Co., Japan’s second-biggest life insurer. “Friday’s
number was really bad. Concerns about inflation are muted.
Market participants may change their view about the Fed raising
interest rates earlier than the target.”  Ten-year  yields  were little changed at 2.06 percent as of
10:17 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The 2 percent note due in February 2022 changed hands at 99
15/32.  The yield was as low as 2.04 percent today, the least since
March 13. It dropped 15 basis points last week, the most since
the period ended Dec. 16.  Japan ’s 10-year yield declined 2 1/2 basis points, or 0.025
percentage point, to 0.960 percent. It has dropped for four
days, the longest stretch since Feb. 29.  Easing Inflation  The U.S. consumer price index advanced 0.3 percent after
climbing 0.4 percent in February, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the
April 13 report.  The producer price  index  probably rose 0.3 percent last
month after a 0.4 percent gain in February, economists forecast
ahead of the April 12 Labor Department data.  Treasuries have returned 0.2 percent so far this month,
recovering from March’s 1 percent loss, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Thirty-day fed futures contracts for delivery in July 2014
yielded 0.52 percent as of April 6, indicating investors expect
Fed rates to be higher by then. The contract settles at the
average overnight fed funds rate for the delivery month. Earlier
in the week, traders were betting on an increase in March 2014,
the contracts show.  Treasuries opened in  Asia  after an abbreviated session
April 6 in the U.S. for Good Friday.  Trading is scheduled to stop at 3 p.m. Tokyo time today and
remain shut in the U.K. for Easter Monday, resuming as usual in
the U.S., based on  recommendations  from the New York-based
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
