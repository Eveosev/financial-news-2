Egypt  will offer 3.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($580 million) of treasury bonds, a day after
nominations ended for candidates to enter the first presidential
vote since President  Hosni Mubarak ’s ouster. Dollar bonds fell.  The Arab nation will seek bids for 2 billion pounds of
three-year notes and 1.5 billion pounds of five-year bonds at an
auction today, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. It
paid an average yield of 16.17 percent and 16.69 percent,
respectively, at the most recent sales of similar maturity
securities.  The elections commission said yesterday it accepted
applications from 23 candidates vying for Egypt’s top office at
elections scheduled to be held May 23 and 24. The final list of
qualified nominees will be announced April 26. The vote pits
Islamist candidates against a number of secular figures
including  Omar Suleiman , one of the most-senior figures in
former President Hosni Mubarak’s government.  The finance ministry  has raised its target amounts at all
domestic debt sales this quarter, totalling 25 billion pounds
out of its goal of 150 billion by the end of June.  The yield on the 5.75 percent of dollar bonds due in 2020
gained six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.82
percent at 11:04 a.m. in Cairo, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the highest level in more than a month. The
Egyptian pound was little changed at 6.0360 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
