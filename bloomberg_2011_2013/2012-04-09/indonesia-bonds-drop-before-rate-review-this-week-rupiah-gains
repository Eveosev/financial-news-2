Indonesia ’s bonds fell, sending
yields to the highest in almost two weeks, on speculation the
central bank will hold interest rates when it meets this week.
The rupiah advanced.  Bank Indonesia  will leave the benchmark  reference rate  at
5.75 percent on April 12 after cutting it by 25 basis points in
February, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Oversea-
Chinese Banking Corp. Consumer prices rose 3.97 percent in March
from a year earlier, the first acceleration in seven months, the
Central Bureau of Statistics said last week.  “Bonds aren’t very attractive now given accelerating
inflation,” said Aris Setiawan, a Jakarta-based foreign-
exchange trader at PT Rabobank Internasional Indonesia. “Bank
Indonesia won’t cut or raise  interest rates  this week.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.95
percent as of 4:02 p.m. in Jakarta, according to closing prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. That was the highest
level since March 27.  The rupiah gained 0.1 percent to 9,150 per dollar,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, climbed 25 basis
points to a one-week high of 7 percent. The measure reached 6.50
percent on April 3, the lowest level since Sept. 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
