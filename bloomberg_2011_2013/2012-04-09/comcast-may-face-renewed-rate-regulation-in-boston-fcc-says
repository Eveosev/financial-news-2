Boston  may regain power to regulate
cable rates because anticipated competition didn’t materialize,
the Federal Communications Commission said in an order that the
city’s biggest provider  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  can block.  The agency  reversed  its 2001 decision freeing cable service
from rate regulation in Boston. Today’s action responded to
Boston’s filing in May arguing that cable provider RCN Corp.
wasn’t expanding, leaving most residents without a competing
service, the FCC said in its order released by e-mail today.  Comcast may ask the agency to consider competition from
satellite-television providers such as  DirecTV (DTV)  and  Dish Network
Corp. (DISH) , and Boston won’t be able to resume rate regulation while
the FCC considers that argument, according to the order.  “We plan to refile as soon as possible,”  Sena Fitzmaurice , a Washington-based spokeswoman for Comcast, said in
a statement. Philadelphia-based Comcast expects to demonstrate
sufficient competition to meet the FCC’s threshold for lifting
rate regulation, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
