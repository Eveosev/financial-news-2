The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and share prices are as of the close in Buenos
Aires.  The  Merval (MERVAL)  index fell 1.4 percent to 2,522.18.  Grupo Financiero Galicia SA (GGAL)   retreated 1.2 percent
to 3.18 pesos, its lowest price since Jan. 3. Argentina’s
largest consumer lender was the most active stock today by value
with 6.8 million pesos ($1.6 million) changing hands. It fell in
line with global stocks after March job creation in the U.S.
trailed economists’ estimates.  YPF SA (YPFD)   fell 2 percent to 122.5 pesos, its lowest
closing price since July 2009. The Argentine government may
disclose this week its plans for the country’s largest oil
company, newspaper El Cronista reported, citing unidentified
provincial officials. The plans may include an ownership model
that includes the participation of the federal state, provinces
and private capital, Cronista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
