A  gauge  of U.S. company credit risk
rose for a fourth straight day, the longest streak since
November, as traders responded to last weekâ€™s report showing
employers added fewer jobs than economists had estimated in
March.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, climbed 1.9 basis points to a mid-price of
102.1 basis points as of 5:08 p.m. in  New York , according to
Markit Group Ltd. The index touched the highest level since Feb.
16, matching the longest stretch of increases since the period
ended Nov. 17, when it climbed for four consecutive days.  The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, climbed in
reaction to a Labor Department report on April 6, a shortened
trading day in the  bond market , that showed hiring trailed
estimates, casting doubt on the strength of the U.S. economic
recovery. The payroll increase of 120,000 jobs was the smallest
in five months.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
