Azerbaijan ’s secular opposition
groups are planning to stage new protests ahead of next month’s
Eurovision Song Contest after holding the biggest demonstration
since 2005 against the government of President  Ilham Aliyev .  The Public Chamber, which comprises the main opposition
parties Musavat, People’s Front, National Independence and
several other opposition groups, said 10,000 people attended a
sanctioned rally yesterday in a suburb 10 kilometers from the
center of the capital, Baku. City police put the number at about
1,200. The next protest is set for April 22.  The protesters demanded Aliyev’s resignation and democratic
change and called for the release of 16 people imprisoned for
attending unsanctioned opposition rallies held in Baku last
year. Aliyev took over from his father in 2003.  Emboldened by popular movements that have toppled
authoritarian leaders in the  Middle East , Azeri opposition
leaders want to seize the media spotlight in the weeks before
Baku hosts Eurovision, the world’s most watched singing
competition. Azerbaijan, a Caspian Sea nation of 9 million
people, is the third-biggest energy producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan.  “We are confident that democratic changes will come to
Azerbaijan too,” Isa Qambar, leader of the main opposition
party Musavat, or Equality, told the protesters. “It is only a
matter of time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
