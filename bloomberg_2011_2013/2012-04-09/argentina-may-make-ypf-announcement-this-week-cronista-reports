The Argentine government may
disclose its plans for oil producer  YPF SA (YPFD)  this week, newspaper
El Cronista reported, citing unnamed provincial officials.  The announcement will likely be made on April 12 when
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  is scheduled to meet
with governors of oil-producing provinces, Buenos Aires-based
Cronista reported.  The governors support an ownership model that includes the
participation of the federal state, the provinces and private
capital, Cronista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
