The six-year-old daughter of a
police corporal was shot dead by suspected Nigerian Islamist
militants belonging to the group Boko Haram in the northeast
town of Potiskum, said Toyin Gbadegeshin, a police spokesman in
Yobe state.  Late yesterday “the gunmen stormed the home of a police
corporal, Hassan Isa, who narrowly escaped before his daughter
was dead,” Gbadegeshin said by phone from Damaturu, the state
capital. “Two other children of the officer, a boy and a girl,
sustained gunshot injuries during the attack and are now
responding to treatment at the Potiskum General Hospital.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
