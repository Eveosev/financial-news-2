Kiler Alisveris Hizmetleri Gida
Sanayi & Ticaret AS (KILER) , a Turkish discount supermarket chain, rose
to a five-month high after Haberturk newspaper reported owner
Kiler Holding AS may offer a stake in the company for sale.  The shares added 3.5 percent to 3.58 liras, closing at the
highest level since Oct. 31.  Kiler Holding, a group with holdings in retail and real
estate, has investors interested in its supermarket chain and
may start a sale process for the unit within a month, Haberturk
reported without saying how it got the information.  “We expect consolidation will continue in the retail
sector,” Istanbul-based brokerage Tera Brokers said in a report
today. “Retail companies including Kiler and  Uyum Gida Ihtiyac
Maddeleri Sanayi & Ticaret AS (UYUM)  are looking for acquisitions for
expansion; however these companies are also candidates for
acquisition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
