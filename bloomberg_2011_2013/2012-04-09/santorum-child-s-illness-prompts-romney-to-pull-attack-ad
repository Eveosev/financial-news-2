Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign
pulled an attack ad set to air in Pennsylvania targeting  Rick Santorum , responding to the Republican rival’s decision to
suspend politicking after the hospitalization of his daughter.  “Stations will comply with this request as soon as they
are technically able,” Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in a
statement.  The campaign asked stations in Pennsylvania to substitute a
pro-Romney commercial praising his record as former governor of
 Massachusetts  for the negative spot.  The $2.9 million ad buy was set to start yesterday, with a
spot focusing on Santorum’s “historically embarrassing” loss
in his 2006 bid for a third U.S. Senate term in Pennsylvania. In
a midterm election in which Republicans lost control of both
chambers of Congress, Santorum was defeated by 18 percentage
points by Democrat Robert Casey.  “We fired him as senator, why promote him to president?”
a narrator in the Romney-sponsored ad asks.  Santorum is pushing to regain momentum from front-runner
Romney in the Republican presidential nomination battle.  While Santorum has vowed to remain a candidate into May,
campaign aides have said winning Pennsylvania’s April 24 primary
is crucial to his political survival. Polls show a close race,
and losing his home state would intensify pressure on Santorum
to end his candidacy.  Delegate Count  Romney tops the race for delegates with 658, followed by
Santorum with 281, former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  with
135 and Representative  Ron Paul  of  Texas  with 51, according to a
tally by the  Associated Press . It takes 1,144 delegates to
clinch the GOP nomination for president. Romney is on pace to
reach the threshold in June, according to AP projections.  Santorum took several days off from the campaign trail
after announcing on April 6 that his three-year-old daughter,
Bella, was hospitalized. She suffers from a rare genetic
disorder known as Trisomy 18, and her survival has defied the
odds for those afflicted with the condition.  Romney also took a break from campaigning, spending the
weekend celebrating the Easter holiday with his family.  Both men plan to hold events today, with Romney campaigning
in Delaware and Santorum scheduled to participate in a religious
forum with Christian broadcaster  James Dobson  in Lancaster,
Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
