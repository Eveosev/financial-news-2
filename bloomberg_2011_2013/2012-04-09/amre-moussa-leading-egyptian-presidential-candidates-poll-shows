Former Arab League Secretary-General
Amre Moussa is leading in  Egypt ’s presidential race, with the
Muslim Brotherhood’s main nominee trailing in eighth place,
according to a poll published by the state-run Al Ahram
newspaper.  Moussa, a former foreign minister under ousted President
 Hosni Mubarak , had the support of 30.7 percent of those polled
while the Brotherhood’s Khairat el-Shater took only 1.7 percent,
according to the survey. In second place was Salafi candidate
Hazem Abu Ismail, who may be disqualified after election
officials said his mother held U.S. citizenship. The law
stipulates that neither a candidate nor either of his parents
may hold a foreign nationality.  Candidate registration for Egypt’s first presidential
elections since Mubarak’s overthrow ended yesterday. The late
entrance of Mubarak’s vice president,  Omar Suleiman , and the
Brotherhood’s decision to contest the race, reversing an earlier
position, have raised tensions ahead of the vote.  The survey, funded by the state-run  Al Ahram  establishment,
was based on interviews between March 31 and April 3 with 1,200
people nationwide except in border provinces, Al Ahram said.
About 8 percent of the interviews were conducted before the
Brotherhood officially announced that it was fielding el-Shater,
the newspaper reported. The margin of error was 4 percent, it
said.  Abdel Moneim Aboul-Fotouh, a former member of the Muslim
Brotherhood, came in third with 8.5 percent while Suleiman was
fourth with 8.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
