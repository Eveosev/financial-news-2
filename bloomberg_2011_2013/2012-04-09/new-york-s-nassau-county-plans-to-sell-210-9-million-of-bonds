New York ’s  Nassau County (9315MF) , whose
finances are controlled by a state oversight board, plans to
sell $210.9 million of general-obligation bonds on April 25,
 Fitch Ratings  said.  Capital projects will consume $147.4 million of the
proceeds, $43.5 million will go toward employee-termination pay
and $20 million will be for legal settlements, Fitch said in a
report today. The county will also issue $34.6 million of
federally taxable bond-anticipation notes.  Fitch cut Nassau’s general-obligation rating one level to
A+, its fifth-highest rank, on Dec. 12, citing the county’s
“strained financial situation.” The downgrade came after the
county received permission from the  Nassau County Interim
Finance Authority  to sell as much as $450 million of bonds
during the next four years.  The authority, which the state created in 2000, assumed
control of the Long Island municipality’s finances in January
2011. It had ruled that the budget had a gap of more than 1
percent of projected spending, the threshold for a takeover.  “Financial flexibility is adequate but limited, as
evidenced by consistent use of non-recurring measures to close
budget gaps, long-term labor contracts, slim margins and reserve
levels, and dependence on potentially volatile sales-tax
revenue,” Fitch analysts wrote today.  At the same time, the county benefits from “a broad and
wealthy economic base with high wealth levels,” Fitch said.  Nassau’s median property tax of $8,206 is the second-
highest among U.S. counties, according to the  Tax Foundation  in
 Washington . Its median  household income  was $92,450 from 2005-
2009, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
