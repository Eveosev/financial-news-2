Baylor University men’s and women’s
basketball teams may be penalized by college sports’ governing
body after an investigation found coaches made more than 1,260
impermissible calls and text messages to recruits,  ESPN
reported.   Men’s coach  Scott Drew , women’s coach  Kim Mulkey  and their
assistants were the target of the investigation. School
spokesman Heath Nielsen didn’t immediately return phone calls or
e-mails, seeking comment.  Baylor self-imposed penalties on its basketball teams after
receiving a 66-page report from the  National Collegiate Athletic
Association  detailing the rules violations last October, ESPN
said.  Mulkey, whose team went 40-0 and won the national
championship this season, can’t recruit off-campus during the
summer recruiting period July 1 through 31, under the self-
imposed sanctions. The women’s basketball program lost two of
its 15 scholarships this past season. The Baylor’s men’s
program, which reached the regional finals this year, lost a
scholarship for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons. Drew and
assistant coach  Jerome Tang  couldn’t make recruiting calls from
Jan. 1 through Feb. 29 of this year. The maximum number of
official visits the men’s basketball team is allowed in 2012-13
was reduced to seven from 12.  Then-Indiana coach Kelvin Sampson was banned from calling
recruits and carrying out off-campus visits for a year after
making nearly 600 impermissible calls when he was coaching at
the University of  Oklahoma , ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
