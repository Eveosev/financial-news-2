time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials climbed

10-year low, after a government report showed an above-average
increase in U.S. stockpiles as mild weather crimped demand.  OIL PRODUCTS  High-sulfur fuel oil swaps fell $7.50, or 1 percent, to
$730.25 a metric ton at 10:12 a.m.  Singapore  time, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. Prices are the

refining losses from the fuel in  Asia , widened to $6.19 a barrel

cents to $135.10 a barrel.  PRECIOUS METALS  April 9 (Bloomberg) -- Gold climbed for a third day,
rebounding from the first weekly drop in three, after worse-
than-forecast U.S. jobs data and the reopening of jewelers in
 India  boosted the outlook for demand. Palladium rallied.  Spot gold advanced as much as 0.8 percent to a one-week
high of $1,648.80 an ounce and traded at $1,643.63 at 2:05 p.m.

gained 4.6 percent this year.  Cash palladium, this year’s worst-performing precious
metal, rose as much as 1.8 percent to $653 an ounce, and last
traded at $650.75. Holdings in exchange-traded products backed

compiled by Bloomberg, the most since Jan. 17. Prices have
declined 0.7 percent this year while gold, silver and platinum
advanced.  BASE METALS  Copper in  China  declined after consumer prices in the
world’s largest base-metals user increased more than forecast
last month, boosting speculation that the government may not add
further stimulus.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans advanced to the highest level in more than seven
months on concern that the U.S. government may pare the global
inventory estimate, signaling smaller supplies for importers led
by China.  The May-delivery contract climbed as much as 0.9 percent to

Exchange, and traded at 3,591 at 4:11 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .
Earlier, the price advanced to 3,623 ringgit, the highest level
since March 2011.  Rubber declined for a fifth day as China’s inflation
accelerated, U.S. employers added fewer jobs than forecast and a
stronger Japanese currency reduced the attraction of yen-based
contracts. September-delivery rubber dropped as much as 1.5
percent to 321 yen a kilogram ($3,950 a metric ton) before
settling at 324.9 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange.
