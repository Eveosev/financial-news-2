site where the country conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009,
Yonhap News  reported  yesterday, citing an unidentified
intelligence official. The communist country also plans to
launch a long-range rocket this month, raising tension in the
region, with the South, Japan and China expressing concern.  “The defense stocks are rising thematically because of
 North Korea  issues,” Chi Ki Ho, a Seoul-based analyst at LIG

every time there are related issues.”  Victek shares have surged 99 percent this year, while Speco
