CME Group Inc. (CME)  is considering
whether to open a futures exchange in  London , according to the
Financial Times, which cited an interview with William Knottenbelt, the head of the company’s European operations.  The Chicago-based operator of three U.S. futures markets is
among bidders for the London Metal Exchange, a person familiar
with the matter told Bloomberg News in February. CME’s European
clearinghouse began in May 2011.  “The company is working to grow its business outside of
the United States, but we don’t have anything to announce at
this time,” Laurie Bischel, a CME spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
