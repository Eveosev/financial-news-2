AT&T Inc. (T)  agreed to sell a majority
stake in its Yellow Pages directory division to Cerberus Capital
Management LP for about $950 million as part of an effort to
dispose of units that are holding back revenue growth.  AT&T will receive $750 million in cash and a $200 million
note, according to a statement from the Dallas-based phone
carrier today. AT&T will keep a 47 percent stake in the
business, which had about $3.3 billion in revenue in 2011.  The sale lets AT&T, which hung on to its Yellow Pages
division as competitors fled the business, to reduce its
exposure to a unit facing increasing competition from online
rivals  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  and  Yelp Inc. (YELP)  To boost sales,
AT&T, the biggest U.S. phone company, is focusing on its mobile-
phone business, where it trails Verizon Wireless.  “It is a sensible step,” Craig Moffett, a Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. analyst in New York who rates AT&T shares market
perform, wrote in a report. “Unfortunately for AT&T, however,
the transaction is barely material, either in the proceeds it
returns or in the change it portends to AT&T’s overall growth
rate.”  Sales at the Yellow Pages business declined 16 percent last
year, compared with  revenue  growth of about 2 percent for AT&T
as a whole. Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson said in
January that the company was looking “to either divest or
restructure low-performing and non-strategic assets.”  Shares Fall  AT&T fell 1 percent to $30.64 at the close in  New York . The
 shares  have gained 1.3 percent this year.  The company said it won’t change its earnings forecast or
dividend plans as a result of the sale.  The advertising unit publishes about 1,200 Yellow Pages
directories in 22 states. AT&T recorded fourth-quarter costs of
48 cents a share to reduce the value of assets of its directory
operations. The company’s  net loss  was $1.12 a share in the
quarter.  Private-equity companies have made several investments in
Yellow Pages businesses since 2000, drawn by the traditionally
steady cash flow. KKR & Co. bought  France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s
PagesJaunes SA in 2006, while Hicks Muse Tate & Furst Inc. and
Apax Partners LLP bought  BT Group Plc (BT/A) ’s Yellow Pages unit in
2001.  Cerberus, a New York-based private-equity firm run by
Stephen Feinberg, has been raising money, including a $4 billion
flagship fund. Recent investments include the $1.02 billion
acquisition with  Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT)  of 64 hotels from
Innkeepers USA Trust in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
