Ship owners are anchoring the most
commodity carriers since at least 2008 after the biggest slump
in rates for more than a decade, cutting capacity just as
Brazilian farmers prepare for record soybean exports.  More than 25 percent of the Panamax fleet was anchored last
month, the most in data compiled by Bloomberg since 2008. Daily
 rates  for the 750-foot-long vessels will average $10,000 this
quarter, 25 percent more than in the first three months and the
biggest increase in more than two years, the median of nine
analyst estimates shows. Shares of Athens-based  Safe Bulkers (SB) 
Inc., which owns 18 Panamaxes, will rise 35 percent in 12
months, according to the average of seven predictions.  Rates have been below the $13,000 owners need to break even
every day this year, spurring more idling. The slump reflects a
glut of  capacity  rather than less trade, with Clarkson Plc, the
biggest shipbroker, forecasting record volume in 2012. Owners
with fleets of 20 vessels or more may keep anchoring some ships
to boost rates for those still competing for business, said Greg Lewis, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG.  “Can that strengthen rates? Absolutely,” said the New
York-based analyst, whose recommendations on the shares of
shipping companies returned 18 percent in the past six months.
“With the improvement in crop cargoes, we may see a pick up.”  Maritime Routes  Rates slumped 37 percent to $8,277 since Jan. 1, the worst
start to a year since at least 2000, according to data from the
London-based  Baltic Exchange , which publishes freight costs
along more than 50 maritime routes.  They averaged $7,983 in the first quarter, the lowest since
the final three months of 2008, when economies where going
through the worst global recession since World War II. The
predicted 25 percent gain would be the biggest quarter-on-
quarter advance since the end of 2009.  Returns for owners slumped because they ordered too many
ships in 2007 and 2008, when rates reached a record $94,977. The
fleet expanded 46 percent since the end of 2007 and  outstanding 
orders at ship yards are still equal to 36 percent of existing
capacity, data from Redhill, England-based IHS Fairplay show.  As little as 19 percent of the fleet was  anchored  in August
and last year’s average was 22 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. While that includes vessels waiting to load or
discharge cargoes, the increase indicates more are being idled
by owners or can’t find charters.  Fund Management  Brazilian soybean exports will jump 23 percent to 36.9
million metric tons in the 12 months ending in September, more
than compensating for a 3.4 percent decline in Argentine
shipments to 8.9 million tons, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates. The extra 7 million tons from  Brazil , the
largest soy shipper, is enough to fill about 100 Panamaxes.  The greatest influence on Panamax rates in the second
quarter is South American crop cargoes, said Philippe van den Abeele, the managing director of Castalia Fund Management (U.K.)
Ltd., a London-based adviser to a hedge fund trading shipping
derivatives.  A surge in South American demand may spur vessels to haul
anchor and compete for cargoes, driving rates lower. Laid end-
to-end, the fleet of anchored Panamaxes would stretch for about
108 kilometers (67 miles). Owners may also speed up vessels so
they can pick up more cargoes, reversing a three-year trend. The
average Panamax  sailed  at 8.6 knots last month, from 11.3 knots
in May 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Agricultural Service  Drought damaged crops across  South America  this season,
potentially reducing the amount available for export. Brazil’s
soybean crop will probably be 66 million tons, less than the
official USDA estimate of 68.5 million tons, the agency’s
 Foreign Agricultural Service  said in a report March 30. Growers
had harvested 82 percent of the crop as of April 5, according to
Celeres, a research company based in Uberlandia, Brazil.  Demand for the region’s crops also may be weaker than
expected after Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  cut the nation’s
growth target to 7.5 percent last month, the lowest since 2004.
The country consumes 28 percent of the world’s soybeans, 22
percent of its corn and 17 percent of its wheat, USDA data show.
The agency cut its forecast for  China ’s soybean imports by 0.9
percent to 55 million tons last month, still a record amount.  Safe Bulkers has the largest proportion of Panamaxes within
its fleet of any of the 10 largest publicly traded companies
operating the vessels, data from London-based Clarkson show. It
will report a 19 percent gain in profit this year to $106.6
million, the mean of five estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Pure Play  Shares of the company rose 6 percent to $6.35 in  New York 
this year, as of 11:20 a.m. local time yesterday, and will reach
$8.57 within 12 months, according to predictions compiled by
Bloomberg. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities jumped
8.6 percent and Treasuries lost 1.1 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows.  That compares with a 13 percent advance in the 14-member
Bloomberg Pure Play Dry Bulk Shipping Index and a 31 percent
gain in the Bloomberg Tanker Index of six companies carrying
crude and refined oil products. Rates to haul crude from  Saudi
Arabia  to  Japan , the industry’s benchmark route, rose more than
threefold this year, data from Clarkson show.  Global seaborne trade in dry bulk commodities, which also
includes coal and iron ore, will reach 3.814 billion tons this
year, compared with 3.685 billion tons in 2011, Clarkson
estimates. About 90 percent of world trade goes by sea, the
Round Table of International Shipping Associations estimates.  Transport Costs  The second-quarter Panamax rate predicted in the Bloomberg
survey is 5.8 percent higher than the costs anticipated by
forward freight agreements, traded by brokers and used to bet on
future transport costs. Contracts for the period are trading at
$9,456, according to data from the Baltic Exchange.  “The market still has far too many ships, but maybe the
glut won’t be quite so awful for a while,” said Erik Nikolai Stavseth, the analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo whose
recommendations on the shares of shipping companies returned 26
percent in the past year. “Owners are becoming increasingly
resistant to these dire markets and we are moving into peak
Latin American shipping season so demand is strengthening.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
