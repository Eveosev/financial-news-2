Eight members of  Estonia ’s
opposition Center Party, including four lawmakers, left the
party citing its lack of democracy and disagreements with the
leadership over “isolationist” policies.  The eight, including European Parliament members Siiri Oviir and Vilja Savisaar-Toomast, said they would continue to
stand for “a strong middle class,” according to a statement e-
mailed today.  The move reduced the party’s seats in the 101-member
Riigikogu to 21, following the defection of another lawmaker
last month over dissent with Chairman and Tallinn Mayor Edgar Savisaar. Tumult within the party will help the ruling coalition
of Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip , which saw its support in opinion
polls slide last month to the lowest level since elections were
held a year ago, said Rein Toomla, a political science lecturer
at  Tartu University .  The Center party and opposition Social Democrats back
higher social spending and scrapping Estonia’s zero-level
corporate income tax on reinvested profits. Center was the
Baltic nation’s only party opposing parliamentary ratification
of  Europe ’s temporary rescue fund last September and of the
second bailout package for  Greece  in February, saying Estonia’s
lower living standards didn’t justify help for wealthier
European countries.  Political infighting has cut Center’s public backing since
January, according to an opinion poll by TNS Emor published on
March 26. Even so, the combined support for Center and
opposition Social Democrats rose to a record 53 percent last
month following the country’s biggest strikes since independence
in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
