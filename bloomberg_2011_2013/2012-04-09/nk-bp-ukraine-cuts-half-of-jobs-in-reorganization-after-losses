TNK-BP Ukraine is cutting half of
its staff and making its  Linik (TLNICRUD)  oil refinery a separate unit as
part of a “radical” business change after net losses in the
past two years.  TNK-BP,  Russia ’s third-biggest oil producer, will cut
administrative spending in Ukraine, focus on marketing and keep
a representative office, the Kiev-based division said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The Linik refinery will be made into a separate unit after
being halted in March for repairs for an indefinite period
because it was unprofitable, TNK-BP Ukraine said today. The
Ukrainian operations had a net loss of $68 million in 2010 and
$23 million last year, according to the statement.  The new business structure is set to be approved by May 1
and come into effect from July 1, according to the statement.
TNK-BP’s board will consider mothballing the refinery, the
company said.  TNK-BP may seek to sell Linik, the  Kommersant-Ukraine 
newspaper reported today, citing market participants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
