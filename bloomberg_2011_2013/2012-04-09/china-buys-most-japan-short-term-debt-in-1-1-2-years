China  bought the most short-term
Japanese debt since May 2010 in February, according to data
released by  Japan ’s Ministry of Finance today.  The world’s largest holder of foreign-exchange reserves
increased net purchases of short-term Japanese debt to 651
billion yen ($8 billion), the highest since May 2010, when China
bought 694.8 billion yen, according to Japanese government data
going back to 2005. China sold 268.8 billion yen of medium- and
long-term Japanese bonds in February.  “China may have increased yen assets as the currency
became cheaper,” said  Akihiko Inoue , chief strategist in  Tokyo 
at Mizuho Investors Securities Co., one of the 25 primary
dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales. “The yen fell
in February after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  eased policy.”  The yen reached 84.18 per dollar on March 15, the lowest
since April 13, 2011, and was at 81.52 as of 12:28 p.m. in
Tokyo. The currency dropped against all of its 16 major
counterparts in February. Japan’s 10-year yields have fallen two
basis points since the start of this year, and were at 0.96
percent today.  The BOJ on Feb. 14 unexpectedly added 10 trillion yen to an
asset-purchase program and set an inflation goal of 1 percent
after an economic slide fueled criticism it’s lagging behind
efforts by other central banks to support growth.  Officials in both China and Japan have signaled the two
nations will increase investments in each other’s government
debt. People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor Yi Gang said on
March 12 the nation will buy Japanese  government bonds , while
Japanese Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  said the following day the
country got approval to purchase $10.3 billion in Chinese debt.
Azumi said Japan will start the purchases in small amounts.  China’s  foreign reserves  were at $3.18 trillion at the end
of December, down from a record $3.27 trillion in October,
according to the latest available data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
