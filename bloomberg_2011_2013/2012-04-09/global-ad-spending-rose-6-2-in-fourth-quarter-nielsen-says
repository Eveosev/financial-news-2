Advertisers increased spending 6.2
percent in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier,
according to  Nielsen Holdings NV. (NLSN)   Worldwide spending rose to $131 billion, while U.S.
advertising fell 0.2 percent to $31 billion, New York-based
Nielsen said in its Global AdView Pulse report released today.  The global advertising industry continued to achieve gains
after climbing out of recession in 2010. The fourth-quarter
advances contributed to a full-year increase worldwide of 7.3
percent to $498 billion, Nielsen said.  Geography mattered. Annual ad spending rose 11 percent to
$20 billion for the region comprising the Middle East and
 Africa , and 12 percent to $213 billion in the Asia-Pacific.
There was a 0.4 percent decline in  Europe , to $70 billion,
according to the report.  Latin America  had 12 percent growth, to
$80 billion.  Nielsen found that “all traditional media types”
attracted more ad spending in 2011, led by a 10 percent gain to
$324 billion for television. That medium also commanded the
largest portion of the global ad market, 65 percent. Internet ad
spending advanced 24 percent, Nielsen said.  Ad spending in clothing and retail increased the most, at
18 percent last year, according to the report.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
