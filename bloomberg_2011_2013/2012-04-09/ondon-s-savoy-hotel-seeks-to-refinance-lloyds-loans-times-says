London ’s Savoy Hotel is seeking
refinancing on 230 million pounds ($365 million) of bank loans
that mature this year, the London-based Times  reported , citing
an unidentified person with knowledge of the process.  The hotel’s debts are mainly loans from  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY) , which is looking to syndicate most of them, the
newspaper said. Directors of the Savoy’s holding company,
Breezeroad, have asked insurers, lenders and sovereign wealth
funds whether they are interested, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
