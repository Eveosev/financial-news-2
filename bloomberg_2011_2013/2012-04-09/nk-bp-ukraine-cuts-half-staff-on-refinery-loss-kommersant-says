TNK-BP Ukraine is cutting half of
its staff in the country and separating its  Linik (TLNICRUD)  refinery into
a separate business after net losses in 2010 and 2011,
 Kommersant-Ukraine  said, citing an unidentified press official.  TNK-BP may also sell the refinery, the Kiev-based newspaper
reported, citing market participants. The Russian oil producer
halted operations at the refinery in March for repairs.  Inna Troyan, a TNK-BP spokeswoman in Ukraine, didnâ€™t
immediately comment when called by Bloomberg news.  To contact the reporter on this story:
