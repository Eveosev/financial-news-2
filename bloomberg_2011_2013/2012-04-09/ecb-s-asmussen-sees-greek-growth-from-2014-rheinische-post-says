European Central Bank Executive
Board member Joerg Asmussen said he expects  Greece  to return to
growth in 2014 provided it implements its austerity program, and
the aim is to keep the country in the euro and return it to
capital markets starting in 2015,  Rheinische Post  reported,
citing an interview.  Asmussen also said investors shouldn’t assume the ECB will
conduct more long-term refinancing operations and existing
bailout funds are sufficient to protect euro-region countries
from speculators, according to the report.  “What matters is that the ECB’s non-standard measures are
only available for a limited time and nobody should conclude
from the fact that we conducted such a refinancing operation
twice that we will do it for a third time,” Asmussen was cited
as saying. “Discussions in  capital markets  about ever-bigger
and more massive firewalls are based, in my opinion, on the
simplified assumption that only a single measure can resolve the
crisis. That’s wishful thinking.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
