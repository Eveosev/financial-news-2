The cost of insuring Japanese
corporate bonds from default increased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 4.5 basis points to
162 as of 9:16 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG. The
benchmark is set for its highest close since March 22, according
to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Markets in Australia and  Hong Kong  are closed today for a
public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
