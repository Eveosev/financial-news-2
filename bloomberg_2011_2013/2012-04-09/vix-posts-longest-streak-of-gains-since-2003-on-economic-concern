The benchmark gauge for U.S. options
 prices  rose for a seventh day, the longest streak since August
2003, as concern about employment growth and earnings spurred
investors to guard against losses in stocks.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, rose 13 percent to 18.81 today, its highest
level in a month. The VIX measures the cost of options on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which has fallen four straight days
and retreated 1.1 percent to 1,382.20 today.  “We’re in a corrective phase and people are protecting
themselves,” Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal
Global Investors, which oversees about $242 billion, said today
in a phone interview. “The economic data is softening and
there’s a lot of risk in the market.”  Prices to insure equities increased after the Labor
Department said on April 6 that employers added 120,000 jobs,
the fewest in five months and less than the median economist
forecast of 205,000 in a Bloomberg survey. The VIX rose and
equities slumped last week after the  Federal Reserve  signaled it
will refrain from further monetary stimulus and concern grew
about  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Spain  is in “extreme difficulty,” Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said April 4, raising the possibility of a bailout. The
fourth-biggest economy in the region sold 2.59 billion euros
($3.4 billion) of bonds at an auction last week, near the
minimum, and the spread between yields on its 10-year debt and
German bonds widened to a level last seen Dec. 12.  Europe, Earnings  “There’s stress in Europe, concerns about the  U.S. economy 
and heavy news flow coming out in the next weeks in terms of
earnings,” Ralph Edwards, director of derivatives strategy at
Investment Technology Group Inc. in  New York , said in a phone
interview. “All of that is pushing the VIX back up.”  The VIX fell a record 64 percent in the last two quarters
as improvements in U.S. payrolls and consumer confidence pushed
the S&P 500 to its biggest first-quarter rally since 1998,
advancing 12 percent in 2012 through March 30.  Alcoa Inc. is scheduled to disclose first-quarter results
tomorrow, the first Dow Jones Industrial Average company to
report. The New York-based aluminum producer will report a loss
of 4 cents a share, according to the average of 19 analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  VIX futures  expiring  this month rose 6.2 percent to 19.60,
while May contracts rose 4.9 percent to 21.45. The VIX, a gauge
of expected  S&P 500  price swings over the next 30 days, has
averaged 20.54 over its 22-year history. The VIX averaged 18.04
from January through April 2011, falling to 14.62 on April 28, a
day before the S&P 500 peaked and began a 19 percent decline
that lasted until Oct. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
