Exco Resources Inc. (XCO) , the Dallas-
based natural-gas producer that rejected a buyout offer last
year, fell to its lowest price in more than three years as fuel
prices dropped and a negotiating period expired without a sale
agreement for one of its pipelines.  Exco  declined  1.4 percent to $6.23 at the close in  New
York , the lowest since December 2008. Gas prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange rebounded from a 10-year low today, settling
at $2.107 per million British thermal units.  Exco said Feb. 3 it was in a 45-day period of exclusive
talks with an unidentified private infrastructure fund to sell a
third of TGGT Holdings LLC, a pipeline partnership it owns with
 BG Group Plc. (BG/)  Exco estimated the sale price at more than $400
million and will use the proceeds to pay down debt.  “That period expired a while back and they haven’t
announced anything,”  Michael Hall , an analyst with Robert W.
Baird & Co. in Denver, said in an interview today. A delay in
the sale may complicate Exco’s ability to finance  capital
spending  this year, said Hall, who rates Exco neutral and
doesn’t own the stock.  Exco, which lost $166.7 million, or 78 cents a share, in
the fourth quarter, said Feb. 23 it will “significantly
reduce” drilling this year because of gas prices. About 97
percent of the company’s reserves are gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
