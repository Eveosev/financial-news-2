Saudi Arabia ’s King Abdullah asked
the stock market regulator to investigate trading violations
even if they involve members of the royal family, Al Sharq
reported on its website, citing a letter to the regulator.  An official at the Capital Market Authority declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  The kingdom’s benchmark  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  has surged
20 percent so far this year, a rally that has been driven by
retail investors, according to ING Investment Management’s Yazan Abdeen, who helps oversee about $250 million as a fund manager
in Dubai.  “Some believe that may imply inadequate trading
behavior,” Abdeen said. “The letter is a confirmation that the
CMA has regulatory power. Increased regulation from fraud is
something the market has to evolve into.”  The benchmark  stock index  slipped 0.3 percent today to
7,697.70 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh, the lowest level
since March 24. The measure yesterday lost 1.8 percent, the most
since Aug. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
