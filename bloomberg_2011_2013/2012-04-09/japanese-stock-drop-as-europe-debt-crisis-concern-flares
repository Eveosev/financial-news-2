Japanese  shares  fell for a fifth day,
sending the Nikkei 225 Stock Average to its longest losing
streak since November, as U.S. employers added fewer jobs than
expected, damping the outlook for recovery in the world’s
biggest economy and hurting the earnings prospects for exporters.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that earns more than half of
its sales from  North America  and  Europe , slipped 2.4 percent
after the yen strengthened. Hitachi Construction Machinery Co.,
which counts  China  as its biggest market, lost 2.3 percent after
mainland inflation accelerated more than forecast in March,
damping expectations of further easing. Takashimaya Co. fell 2.6
percent after the retailer’s president said the department store
market will contract, according to a Nikkei newspaper report.  “The job data reduced investors’ optimism,” said  Naoki
Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6.4 billion at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. in  Tokyo . “People in the markets are getting
more cautious and the mood is growing that the  U.S. economy 
won’t recover so easily.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  fell 1.5 percent to 9,546.26 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo. Volume on the gauge was about 30 percent lower
than the 30-day average. The broader Topix Index lost 1.5
percent to 813.69, with five times as many shares declining as
advancing. All 33 industry groups on the gauge declined.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slipped 1
percent today after the Labor Department said on April 6 that
U.S. employers added 120,000 jobs in March, the lowest number in
five months. The data also showed the  unemployment rate  fell to
8.2 percent as people left the labor force. Markets in the U.S.
were closed April 6 for the Easter holiday.  Yen Strengthens  Stocks fell as the yen appreciated to as high as 81.20
against the dollar today in Tokyo, compared with 82.27 at the
close of stock trading on April 6.  Japan ’s currency strengthened
to 106.18 from 107.55 against the euro. A stronger yen cuts the
value of some overseas income for Japanese companies.  Honda, Japan’s second-biggest carmaker by market value,
slipped 2.4 percent to 2,937 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker
that gets about 80 percent of its revenue overseas, retreated
1.7 percent to 3,780 yen.  A strengthening yen puts more pressure on the  Bank of Japan 
to do more to stimulate the economy. Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
said the bank’s asset-purchase program may be extended on April
27 when inflation data becomes available, according to Morgan
Stanley MUFG Securities Co. The central bank concludes a two-day
meeting on interest rate policy tomorrow.  “The situation is chaotic because we don’t know what
conditions could trigger additional easing,” said Koichi Kurose,
chief economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd.  Exporters to China  Shares linked to China also declined as faster-than-
estimated inflation reduced the scope for the government to ease
monetary policy to spur growth. Consumer prices rose 3.6 percent
from a year earlier after gaining 3.2 percent in February, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on its website today. That
was more than the economists’ estimates of 3.4 percent.  Hitachi Construction (6305)  retreated 2.3 percent to 1,707 yen.
Komatsu Ltd., an excavator maker that counts China as its
biggest market, lost 2 percent to 2,296 yen. TDK Corp., a
manufacturer of electronic parts which gets almost a third of
its revenue from China, fell 1.7 percent to 4,365 yen.  Takashimaya slumped 2.6 percent to 636 yen, its biggest
drop since Dec. 27, after President Koji Suzuki said the
domestic department store market “will lose 1 trillion yen in
sales over the next five years and shrink to 5.2 trillion yen by
2016,” according to a Nikkei report.  Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp. (6474)  tumbled 3.4 percent to 431 yen after
the bearing maker said net income fell 40 percent to 1.37
billion yen ($17 million) in the quarter ended Feb. 29. It said
earnings were hurt by the stronger yen, higher raw materials
costs and expenses from overseas business expansion.  Sony Rallies  Among stocks that gained,  Sony Corp. (6758)  rallied 0.6 percent to
1,644 yen. Japan’s biggest consumer-electronics exporter erased
earlier losses of as much as 3 percent after the Nikkei reported
that the company will cut 10,000 jobs worldwide.  The value of shares  traded  on the first section of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange totaled 964.3 billion yen, the lowest level
since Jan. 30, amid market closures today in  Australia , New
Zealand and  Hong Kong  today for national holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
