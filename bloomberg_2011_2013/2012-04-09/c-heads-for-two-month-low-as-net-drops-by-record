HTC Corp. (2498)  fell to the lowest in two
months in Taipei trading after the smartphone maker posted its
biggest profit drop since listing a decade ago.  HTC dropped 6.8 percent to NT$545 at the close today, the
lowest since Feb. 7. Taiwan’s benchmark  Taiex Index (TWSE)  declined 1.4
percent.  First-quarter net income tumbled 70 percent from a year
earlier to NT$4.46 billion ($151 million), HTC,  Asia ’s second-
biggest maker of smartphones, said April 6. The average of 17
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of
NT$4.62 billion.  Revenue at the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company fell 35
percent to NT$67.8 billion amid  competition  from Apple Inc. and
Samsung Electronics Co. That compares with the NT$71.1 billion
average of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg and HTC’s
own projection of NT$65 billion to NT$70 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
