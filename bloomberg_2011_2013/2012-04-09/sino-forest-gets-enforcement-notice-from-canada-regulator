Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) , the Chinese
timber company that filed for bankruptcy last month after being
accused of fraud, received an enforcement notice from  Canada ’s
main securities regulator.  The April 5 notice from the Ontario Securities Commission
“contains allegations of a serious nature” consistent with a
cease-trade order issued on Aug. 26, Sino-Forest said in a
statement yesterday. Chief Financial Officer David Horsley and
former Chief Executive Officer  Allen Chan  also received notices,
the Hong Kong- and Mississauga, Ontario-based company said.  Enforcement notices are usually issued by the commission
close to the end of an investigation and say that staff are
considering formal proceedings, Sino-Forest said. The commission
halted trading of Sino-Forest in August and began a probe after
the company was accused in June by short seller Carson Block of
exaggerating its revenue. Sino-Forest has denied the
allegations.  The commission said at that time that the company and some
of its officials may have provided public information that was
false or misleading.  The company also said yesterday that enforcement notices
were received by Alfred C.T. Hung, George Ho and Simon Yeung,
all of whom Sino-Forest said in August it was placing on
administrative leave. Albert Ip, who resigned in March, got an
enforcement notice as well.  Separately, the commission said yesterday it will hold a
hearing April 13 to consider whether to extend the cease-trade
order it made on Aug. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
