The Treasury 10-year note yield fell
to the lowest in four weeks as investors sought the safety of
 U.S. debt  amid concern the global recovery is slowing.  U.S. yields tumbled April 6, when a Labor Department report
showed jobs growth fell short of forecasts in March, spurring
speculation the  Federal Reserve  may be more likely to initiate a
third round of asset purchases, a policy known as quantitative
easing. Investors prepared to bid at three sales of coupon-
bearing debt totaling $66 billion starting tomorrow.  “It creates this back and forth with what the Fed may or
may not do,” said  Kevin Flanagan , a Purchase, New York-based
fixed-income strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
Additional weakness in job growth indicates “the Fed probably
is going do something, so the market rallies off it,” he said.  U.S. 10-year yields fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.05 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note
due in February 2022 gained 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 18/32. The yield declined to as low as 2.02
percent, the least since March 12. It dropped 15 basis points
last week, the most since the period ended Dec. 16.  The 30-year bond yield touched 3.17 percent, the lowest
since March 13.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.1 percent,
reaching the lowest level since March 13.  Inflation Measure  The  difference  between 10-year yields on conventional U.S.
government securities and Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities narrowed to 2.24 percentage points, the smallest
since March 7. The gap, known as the breakeven spread, is a
projection of the rate of inflation during the life of the debt.  The gap between yields on Treasuries maturing in two and 10
years narrowed to 1.73 percentage points, the least since March
12, the day before the Fed upgraded its assessment of the  U.S.
economy .  This week’s three three-, 10- and 30-year securities
auctions will raise $23.1 billion of new cash as maturing
securities held by the public total total $42.9 billion.  U.S. 10-year note yields will reach 2.56 percent by the end
of the year, according to weighted average in a Bloomberg News
survey of analysts.  Employers added 120,000 jobs in March and the jobless rate
fell to 8.2 percent, the Labor Department said April 6. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 205,000
rise. The report underscores Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s
concern that recent gains may not be sustained without a pickup
in growth.  Fed Stance  The central bank on March 13 reiterated its previous
statement that economic conditions would probably warrant
“ exceptionally low ”  interest rates  at least through late 2014.
It has kept its target rate for overnight bank loans to a range
of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  The Fed sold $1.26 billion of TIPS today maturing from July
2012 to January 2015 as part of a program to replace $400
billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings with longer
maturities to cap borrowing costs.  The increase in payrolls was the smallest in five months,
and was less than the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey in which the median estimate called for a 205,000
rise. Unemployment fell to 8.2 percent, the lowest since January
2009, from 8.3 percent.  The slowing pace of employment gains indicates it’s too
early to declare the economy self-sustaining, according to
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Mohamed A. El-Erian.  Economic Outlook  “We have structural problems all over our economy,” El-
Erian, chief executive officer at Pimco in  Newport Beach ,
 California , said in an “In the Loop” interview with Betty Liu
on Bloomberg Television. “The duration of unemployment is at
record highs. When it comes to hiring for future business,
companies are still hesitant.”  The  unemployment rate  fell to 8.2 percent from 8.3 percent,
even as fewer jobs than forecast were added, as people left the
 labor force .  “People have slightly adjusted their probabilities toward
QE3,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist BNP Paribas
in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“The Fed’s done a very good job of indicating to the street
they’re very data dependent, and that’s what everyone’s
responding to.”  Consumer prices excluding food and energy likely rose 2.2
percent for the 12 months ended March, matching the result for
February, the Labor Department in  Washington  is likely to say
April 13, according to the median forecast of 26 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Price Data  Prices including more volatile energy and food costs,
likely rose 2.7 percent for the period ended March, down from
2.9 percent for 12 months ended February.  Buyers bid $3.19 for each dollar of the $538 billion in
notes and bonds sold this year, the most since the government
began releasing the data in 1992 and on pace to beat the high of
$3.04 in 2011.  The net supply of Treasuries, or gross issuance minus the
amount of maturing debt, will fall by an average of $32.5
billion a month this year, to $77.3 billion, which will leave an
average of $99.4 billion of investable cash a month from
maturing debt, up from $68.1 billion in 2011, according to Ian Lyngen, a strategist in Stamford, Connecticut, at CRT Capital
Group and part of a team led by David Ader which has been ranked
first by Institutional Investor magazine in government-debt
strategy for the past six years. This comes as government sales
stay relatively constant at about $176.75 billion a month, he
said.  “The refining of economic expectations has put in a bid
for Treasuries and this will likely be supportive for auctions
later this week,” Lyngen said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
