Russian farmers bought back grain
from the state for the first time under a program Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin â€™s first deputy for agriculture introduced last
year, state-owned United Grain Co. said.  The Kristina farm in the Omsk region of Western Siberia
acquired 2,970 metric tons of third-grade milling wheat from the
state reserves on April 2, the grain trader said today in a
 statement  on its website. The marketing season ends June 30.  The farm covered storage costs, while repurchasing the
wheat at the same price it received from United Grain in
November and December last year, the trader said.  Russia offered farmers the chance to buy back grain from
January through May after selling to the stockpiles after the
harvest, allowing them to benefit as record exports helped
increase domestic prices. First Deputy Prime Minister  Viktor Zubkov  announced the program on Nov. 14, saying Russia planned
to acquire as much as 1.5 million tons from farmers for
stockpiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
