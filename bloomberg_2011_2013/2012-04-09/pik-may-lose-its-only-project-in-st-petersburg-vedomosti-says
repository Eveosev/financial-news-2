PIK Group (PIKK) , a Russian real-estate
developer, may lose its only project in St Petersburg as the
local authority is reclaiming the site,  Vedomosti  reported,
citing a PIK official.  The city government has filed a court case reclaiming the
land near Pulkovo airport, the newspaper said, citing court
documents.  PIK, which is partly owned by billionaire Suleiman Kerimov,
is in talks with partners and the city government to take the
project forward jointly, the company said by e-mail in response
to questions from Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
