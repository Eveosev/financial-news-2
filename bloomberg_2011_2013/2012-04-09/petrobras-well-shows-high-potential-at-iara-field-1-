Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, discovered “good quality” oil at
its third well at the Iara field in deep waters of the Atlantic
Ocean near the country’s biggest deposits.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
found a reservoir with high potential at the Iara West well and
plans to carry out tests to gage productivity, the company said
in an e-mailed statement.  Brazil has discovered more crude than any other country
over the past decade as it explores reservoirs that are trapped
under miles of water, rock and salt in the so-called pre-salt
region. Petrobras is investing more than any other oil company
to produce the oil and build new refineries to process it into
gasoline and other fuels.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  and  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP)  are Petrobras’s
partners at the project with 25 percent and 10 percent stakes,
respectively. The three companies are also partners at Lula,
Brazil’s biggest oil field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
