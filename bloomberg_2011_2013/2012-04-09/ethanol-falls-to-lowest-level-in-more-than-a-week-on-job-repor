Ethanol fell to the lowest level in
more than a week in  Chicago  after an employment report sparked
concern that fuel demand will slow.  Futures sank 1 percent following the April 6 Labor
Department report that the U.S. created 120,000 jobs in March,
below the median forecast of 205,000 in a Bloomberg News survey.
Ethanol is mixed with gasoline as part of the nation’s plans to
reduce dependence on crude oil.  “The jobs number was worse than they thought,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest in Chicago. “That pretty much made
it a red sea. The energy sector as a whole was getting hit.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery declined 2.2 cents to
settle at $2.262 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
lowest price since March 29. The fuel alternative has gained 2.7
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 3
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.28 a gallon and in Chicago the
biofuel slid 2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.22, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  declined 2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$2.305 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive slipped 0.5
cent to $2.385.  Gasoline for May delivery tumbled 4.38 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $3.2967 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract includes reformulated
gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
