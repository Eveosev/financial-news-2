Severe thunderstorms, possibly
accompanied by tennis ball-sized hail, are expected across
western  Oklahoma  and may move into northern  Texas , according to
the  National Weather Service .  Oklahoma today has a moderate risk of severe storms with a
45 percent chance of hail and 5 percent chance of tornadoes,
said the  Storm Prediction Center  in Norman, Oklahoma.  “Large hail and damaging winds will be the main threats,
although a couple of tornadoes cannot be ruled out,” the
weather service said in a hazardous weather statement.  There’s also a severe risk of damaging systems in parts of
 Kansas , Oklahoma and Texas from April 12 to April 14, according
to the storm center.  In March, 223 tornadoes were reported in the U.S., compared
with a normal for the month of 80, according a report issued
today by the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  Tornadoes and hail struck the Dallas area last week,
causing the cancellation of more than 1,900 flights and damaging
aircraft at  Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport .  A tornado outbreak March 2 and March 3 across the Ohio
Valley and the Southeast killed at least 40 people and caused
more than $1.5 billion in damage, according to NOAA. It was the
first time this year that a weather-related incident caused more
than $1 billion in losses. Last year, the U.S. had 14 such
disasters, according to NOAA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
