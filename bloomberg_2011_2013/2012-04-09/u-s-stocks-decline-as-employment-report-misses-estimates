U.S. stocks fell, dragging the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lower following its worst week of
2012, after employers added fewer jobs than forecast in March.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  General Electric Co. (GE)  sank more than
1.5 percent, pacing declines among industrial shares. Financial
shares lost 1.6 percent among 10 groups in the S&P 500.  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  and Citigroup Inc. erased at least 2.4 percent.
 Alcoa Inc. (AA) , scheduled to report earnings tomorrow, slipped 0.3
percent.  AOL Inc. (AOL)  soared 43 percent after agreeing to sell and
license patents to Microsoft Corp.  The S&P 500 slumped 1.1 percent to 1,382.20 at 4 p.m. New
York time, after losing 0.7 percent last week. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  dropped 130.55 points, or 1 percent, to
12,929.59. About 5.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges today, 19 percent below the three-month average.
Equity markets were shut for Good Friday on April 6, when the
employment report was released.  “At the moment, the one big news story that people have to
focus on is the jobs number so there’s a focus on the
disappointment there,”  John Carey , who helps oversee about $220
billion at Pioneer Investments in  Boston , said in a telephone
interview. “The economy does continue to grow, but slowly, and
I think that’s been the source of frustration for a lot of
investors, that we haven’t had the big forward movement in the
economy like we have in the past.”  Equities slumped last week after the  Federal Reserve 
signaled it will refrain from further monetary stimulus and
concern about  Europe  intensified. The U.S. Labor Department said
April 6 that employers added 120,000 jobs, the fewest in five
months and less than the median economist forecast of 205,000 in
a Bloomberg survey. The amount had exceeded 200,000 for three
straight months.  ‘Real Shock’  “This is a real shock,”  Donald Selkin , the New York-based
chief market strategist at National Securities Corp., which
manages about $3 billion, said last week after the jobs report.
“Everybody is so hung up on the 200,000 increase.”  The U.S. jobs report presents a challenge that stocks have
overcome nine times during the  bull market  that’s driven the  S&P
500 (SPX)  up 107 percent in three years. The government’s monthly
tally of U.S. hiring missed the median projection by 85,000,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the S&P 500
averaged losses of 0.8 percent in the day after shortfalls of
this magnitude since March 2009, the benchmark gauge cut its
decline in half a week later and was up 0.9 percent after two
weeks, the data show.  Most Tied  The  Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC)  of stocks most tied to
the economy slipped 1.9 percent for a fourth straight day of
losses, the longest streak since Nov. 25, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The Dow Jones Transportation Average of
airlines, trucking companies and shipping stocks lost 1.7
percent.  Economists forecast the  U.S. economy  expanded 2 percent in
the first quarter, after growing 3 percent in the last three
months of 2011, according to the average compiled by Bloomberg.  Industrial stocks fell 1.6 percent for the biggest drop as
a group in the  S&P 500 . Caterpillar, the world’s largest
construction and mining-equipment manufacturer, retreated 2.2
percent to $103.57, while General Electric, the maker of jet
engines and power generation equipment, declined 1.5 percent to
$19.20.  The KBW Bank Index dropped 1.9 percent, with all 24 of its
components falling at least 0.9 percent. Bank of America lost
3.3 percent to $8.93, the biggest retreat in the Dow. Citigroup
erased 2.4 percent to $33.97.  DuPont, Alcoa  Raw-material stocks had the third-biggest retreat in the
S&P 500, falling 1.5 percent. DuPont Co., the most valuable U.S.
chemical maker, slumped 1.4 percent to $51.95. Alcoa slipped 0.3
percent to $9.60. The largest U.S. aluminum producer is
scheduled to disclose first-quarter results after the close of
trading tomorrow, the first company in the Dow average to
report. The  average estimate  of 19 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey is for an adjusted loss of 4 cents a share.  Earnings for companies in the S&P 500 increased 0.8 percent
last quarter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. They
exceeded forecasts by 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011
for the 12th straight period of better-than-estimated results,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Shutterfly Inc. sank 4.3 percent to $28.21. The operator of
a website that offers photo-related products dropped after
Facebook Inc. agreed to buy the Instagram photo-sharing
application for about $1 billion.  800 Patents  AOL soared the most since at least November 2009, adding 43
percent to $26.40. The Internet company, under shareholder
pressure to make strategic changes as revenue declines, agreed
to sell and license more than 800 patents to Microsoft in a deal
worth $1.06 billion. Microsoft fell 1.3 percent to $31.10.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  advanced 0.4 percent to $636.23. The world’s
most valuable company erased an earlier decline of as much as
1.3 percent. The Cupertino, California-based company was cut to
neutral from buy by BTIG LLC, which said investors should “take
a breather” on expected strength this quarter.  Equities are failing to build on the S&P 500’s best first-
quarter  rally  since 1998. The U.S.  jobless rate  fell to 8.2
percent, the lowest since January 2009, from 8.3 percent, the
Labor Department said. Faster employment growth that leads to
bigger wage gains is needed to propel  consumer spending  that
accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. Americans worked
fewer hours and earned less on average, helping explain why the
Fed says  interest rates  may need to stay low at least through
late 2014.  Near Zero  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has kept rates near zero since
2008 and expanded the central bank’s balance sheet with two
rounds of asset purchases totaling $2.3 trillion. S&P 500
rallies during the first quarter of 2010 and 2011 stalled in
April both years, with the index sinking as much as 16 percent
and 19 percent, respectively, amid concern the Fed would stop
stimulating the economy.  The S&P 500 surged 12 percent from  January through March  of
this year as data on manufacturing, real estate and the labor
market boosted optimism about the world’s largest economy.
Reports last week showed manufacturing in the U.S. expanded at a
faster pace than forecast while jobless claims dropped to the
lowest level in four years.  Dennis Gartman , an economist and newsletter editor, said he
abandoned his bullish view of stocks in March because of the
possibility the market will retreat.  “The only things that I own at this point are a few
shipping companies and a little natural gas, and I have those
completely hedged with S&P futures,” Gartman, the editor of the
Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter, said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Radio’s “Bloomberg Surveillance.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
