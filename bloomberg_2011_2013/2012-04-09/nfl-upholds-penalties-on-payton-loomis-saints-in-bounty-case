The  National Football League  upheld
the penalties imposed on the New Orleans Saints, coach Sean
Payton and General Manager Mickey Loomis in a case involving
bounties for players to target opponents.  Commissioner Roger Goodell told the Saints he had denied
their appeals after hearings last week. The decision was
announced today in a news release.  Payton was suspended for a year, Loomis for eight games of
the 2012 season and the team was fined $500,000 and lost draft
choices.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
