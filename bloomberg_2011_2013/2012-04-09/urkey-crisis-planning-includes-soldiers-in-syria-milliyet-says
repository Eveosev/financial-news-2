Turkish soldiers may establish
buffer zones in  Syria  by the end of the month to protect
civilians, Milliyet newspaper  reported , citing interviews with
unidentified officials.  Turkish soldiers could establish protective zones and
humanitarian corridors in Syria after April 10 should the number
of refugees in Turkey double to about 50,000 from about 25,000
now, the Istanbul-based newspaper said. The decision to enter
Syria may be taken on security grounds without the approval of
the United Nations, the paper said citing the Turkish officials.  U.S. senators John McCain and  Joe Lieberman  are expected to
meet President Abdullah Gul today in Istanbul, and may also
travel to refugee camps near Turkey’s border with Syria,
Milliyet said.  The plans are part of Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s
vow that Turkey will take additional steps should Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad not abide by an April 10 deadline
agreed with the United Nations for a cease-fire, Milliyet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
