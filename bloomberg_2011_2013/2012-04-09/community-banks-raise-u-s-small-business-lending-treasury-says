Most banks in its Small Business
Lending Fund increased loans by more than 10 percent, the U.S.
Treasury Department reported.  Banks in the program boosted their small-business lending
by $1.3 billion over the prior quarter and a majority of the
participants increased it by 10 percent or more, according to a
Treasury Department report issued to Congress today. Treasury
also said 84 percent of participants increased their lending.  Treasury distributed more than $4 billion of its $30
billion for the program into 332 community banks nationwide with
incentives for those institutions to make more loans to small
businesses.  To contact the reporters on this story:
