Greece  will probably hold general
elections on May 6, as all the required legislation has been
approved, Antonis Samaras, leader of the Greek New Democracy
party, said in an interview on Athens-based Mega TV today.  Samaras said he will aim for a strong parliamentary
majority for his party, the second-biggest in parliament, adding
that a coalition would mean “weak leadership, weak
government.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
