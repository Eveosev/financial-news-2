The Australian and New Zealand
dollars erased advances versus the yen after the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
declined to boost stimulus measures and a Chinese official said
the global environment remains “grim.”  Australia’s bonds surged as Asian stocks fell, with gains
in 15-year debt meaning that all government yields are lower
than the central bank’s overnight rate for the first time in two
months. Demand for the so-called Aussie was supported after
 China  posted an unexpected  trade surplus  and a private report
showed that business confidence in Australia rebounded.  “The market was pricing in a bit more than what they
actually received from the Bank of  Japan ,” said Alex Nicholas,
a foreign-exchange dealer at Velocity Trade Ltd. in Auckland.
“We saw quite a drop following the announcement,” he said,
referring to the Aussie-yen rate.  Australia ’s dollar slid 0.2 percent to 83.88 yen as of 4:12
p.m. in Sydney, after earlier advancing as much as 0.7 percent.
It was unchanged from yesterday at $1.0313, holding onto a
three-day increase. New Zealand’s currency declined 0.3 percent
to 66.77 yen. The so-called kiwi lost 0.1 percent to 82.09 U.S.
cents.  Australia’s government bonds advanced, pushing the yield on
the 10-year security down as much as 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 3.87 percent, the lowest since Feb. 7 and
below the  Reserve Bank  of Australia’s cash rate of 4.25 percent.
The 15-year yield slid 15 basis points to 4.19 percent.  The BOJ kept its key rate at between zero and 0.1 percent,
according to its statement released in  Tokyo  today. The central
bank refrained from expanding monetary easing to counter
deflation, resisting pressure from lawmakers for more stimulus.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks slid 0.3 percent,
following a 1.1 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
yesterday.  China Trade  China’s trade surplus was $5.35 billion, the customs bureau
said in a statement on its website today. Exports rose 8.9
percent from a year earlier, while inbound shipments increased
5.3 percent. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists was for a $3.15 billion trade deficit.  “While there is sustained mediocre-to-good news coming out
of China on the growth front, the Aussie is likely to slowly
grind higher,” said Velocity’s Nicholas.  The March trade data shows the global environment remains
“grim,” Zheng Yuesheng, head of the customs bureau’s
statistics department, said on Chinese state television today.  Australian business confidence rebounded to a reading of 3
last month from a five-month low of 1 in February, a  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  survey of about 400 companies taken March
26-30 and released in Sydney today showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
