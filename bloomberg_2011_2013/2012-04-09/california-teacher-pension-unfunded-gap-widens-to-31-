The California State Teachers’
Retirement System, the second-biggest U.S. public pension, said
the gap between its assets and projected obligations rose $8.5
billion as investment gains failed to cover previous losses.  The unfunded liability climbed 13 percent to $64.5 billion
as of June 30, according to a report from actuaries released
today. The system had about 69 percent of assets needed to cover
promises to current and future retirees at the end of fiscal
2011, down from about 71 percent a year earlier.  The widening gap may require increased state funding, plan
officials have said. Public pensions nationwide had a median of
about 75 percent of the funds needed to cover obligations in
2010, according to Bloomberg Rankings data. The California
fund’s overseers said losses on invested assets in 2008 and 2009
added $12.7 billion to the new deficit figure.  “The projected revenue shortfall is due primarily to
investment return experience averaging 5.5 percent per year over
the last decade that was significantly less than the long-term
actuarial assumption of 7.5 percent,” Milliman Inc. consultants
said, according to the report. The study will be formally
presented to the $152 billion plan’s board members April 12.  Smoothed Results  The so-called funding ratio has been less than 100 percent
since 2001. Because the ratio is “smoothed” by averaging three
years of investment returns to minimize volatility, the latest
gap only partially reflects the almost 24 percent net gain from
investments in fiscal 2011, according to the report. The system
earned 2.3 percent on assets in the past calendar year,
according to a January study.  Teachers pay 8 percent of their income toward retirement.
Districts add 8.25 percent, while the state’s share is about 2
percent. Contribution rates for teachers and school districts
haven’t changed since 1990.  In February, plan overseers lowered the assumed rate of
return on investments to 7.5 percent from 7.75 percent. The
change retroactively added $3.5 billion to the system’s funding
gap as of June, according to the plan report.  By comparison, the  California Public Employees’ Retirement
System , the largest U.S. public pension with $234.8 billion of
assets, has between 70 percent and 75 percent of the money it
needs to cover future liabilities, according to  Brad Pacheco , a
spokesman. Calpers, as the fund is also known, cut its assumed
rate of return to 7.5 percent from 7.75 percent March 14.  The system for state and local government workers was fully
funded when the last recession began. Its ratio of assets to
projected costs dropped to as low as 65 percent after a 28
percent drop in value from December 2007, when the slump
started, to June 2009, when it ended, as the global downturn
depressed equity and property values.  In fiscal 2011, Calpers had an almost 21 percent return on
investments, its best performance in 14 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
