The Orthodox Christian Church of
Cyprus wants to invest hundreds of millions of euros in the
country’s economy to boost jobs and benefit the church,
Archbishop Chrysostomos II said.  “As a church, we are ready to invest so that the economy
improves and people can work,” Chrysostomos said today
following a meeting with President Demetris Christofias,
according to a  transcript  of his comments posted on the Cypriot
government’s information website.  While investment plans include banks and natural gas, the
church is especially looking at solar panels and building a
power production plant, Chrysostomos said. The cost of these
investments could reach tens and possibly hundreds of millions
of euros, he said.  The church has shares in  Bank of Cyprus  Plc and  Hellenic
Bank Pcl (HB)  and a minimal holding in Laiki Bank Group and it sees
no problems for any of these lenders, Chrysostomos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
