Mexico ’s  inflation rate  fell for a
second consecutive month in March, fueling speculation that
policy makers may cut the overnight lending rate to bolster the
economy.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.73 percent from 3.87 percent
in February, the national statistics institute said on its
website today. The median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for prices to rise 3.76 percent. Prices climbed
0.06 percent from the previous month.  Inflation eased after a drought in the north of the country
began to wane, reducing pressure on the cost of agricultural
produce. The central bank said in the minutes of its March 16
rate meeting that it would consider lowering borrowing costs if
inflation remained in check.  Today’s report “helps to build on the willingness of the
central bank to reduce the benchmark rate,” said  Gabriel Casillas , Mexico chief economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Still,
“we continue to believe Banxico will stay on hold for a long
time.”  The yield on Mexico’s fixed-rate peso-denominated debt due
in December 2013 fell 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point,
to 4.60 percent at 10:13 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the biggest daily decline since Nov.
30. The price rose 0.17 centavo to 105.53 centavos per peso.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 13.0023 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:15 a.m. Mexico City time, from 12.9842 April 6. The currency
has appreciated 7.1 percent this year, the best performance of
16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, helping to limit
inflation.  Drought Eases  Prices for agricultural products fell 1.61 percent in
March, while the cost of fruits and vegetables dropped 3.7
percent, the statistics agency said.  “It’s possible to say that the effect of the drought that
we saw last year is fading away,” Casillas said in a telephone
interview in Mexico City.  Core prices, which exclude food and energy, gained 0.24
percent in March from the month before, the statistics agency
said, less than the 0.28 percent median estimate of 12
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Economists lowered their year-end inflation forecast to an
average 3.78 percent from 3.88 percent, in a monthly survey by
the central bank released April 2.  ‘Balance of Risks’  “With respect to the balance of risks for inflation, most
of the board members agreed that it has improved,” policy
makers said in the  minutes  of their March 16 meeting. “If
current favorable conditions in the inflation outlook are
consolidated, it may be advisable to adjust to the downside the
reference interest rate.”  Still, inflation may accelerate in the next few months, in
part because of higher commodity prices, said Gustavo Hernandez,
economic analyst at ScotiaBank Casa Bolsa, which forecasts year-
end inflation of 4.04 percent.  The central bank last cut its benchmark rate in July 2009,
bringing it to a record low 4.5 percent.  The central bank next meets April 27 to decide on rates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
