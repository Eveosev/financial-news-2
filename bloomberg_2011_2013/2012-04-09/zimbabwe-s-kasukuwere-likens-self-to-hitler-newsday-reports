Saviour Kasukuwere,  Zimbabwe ’s
indigenization minister, said he’s the “Hitler of our time”
for forcing foreign-owned companies to sell or cede 51 percent
of their shares to black Zimbabweans,  Newsday  said.  Kasukuwere told the paper he’s seeking justice for his
people and a restoration of their rights over the country’s
resources, Harare-based Newsday said today. “If that is Hitler,
let me be a Hitler tenfold,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
