Splunk Inc., a maker of software
that helps companies analyze data, plans to sell 13.5 million
shares for $8 to $10 each in its initial public offering.  The share sale would value the San Francisco-based company
at $945.5 million at the high end of the range, if underwriters
exercise an overallotment option, according to a  filing  today
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Splunk will
trade under the symbol SPLK on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Splunk delivers software through the Internet that helps
companies monitor and analyze data to improve  service , cut
operations costs and reduce security risks. The company said it
had more than 3,700 customers as of Jan. 31, including Bank of
America Corp., Zynga Inc. and  Harvard University .  Revenue in the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31 rose 83
percent to $121 million. Splunkâ€™s net loss widened to $11
million from $3.81 million a year earlier, according to the
filing.  Chief Executive Officer Godfrey Sullivan has run Splunk
since 2008. He previously led Hyperion Solutions Corp. and
helped sell that company for $3.3 billion to Oracle Corp. in
2007. In July, the company named David Conte as chief financial
officer, gaining an executive with experience at a public
company.  Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Bank of America are leading the IPO. Pacific Crest
Securities, UBS AG and Cowen and Co. are also working on it.  Paul Wilke, a Splunk spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
