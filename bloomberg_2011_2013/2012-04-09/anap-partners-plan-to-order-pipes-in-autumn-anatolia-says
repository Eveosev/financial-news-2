Companies developing the Trans-
Anatolia natural-gas pipeline project, or Tanap, plan to order
pipes and other items in the autumn,  Turkey â€™s official Anatolia
news agency reported, citing Vaqif Aliyev, the vice president of
State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, known as Socar.  Aliyev said Tanap, which also includes Turkish state
pipeline company Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS, or Botas,
and Turkiye Petrolleri AO, has started a feasibility study.  Baku-based Socar plans to offer part of its 80 percent
stake in Tanap to European companies that have shown interest in
the project, Aliyev said. Botas and Turkiye Petrolleri own the
remaining 20 percent of Tanap.  The 2,000-kilometer (1,240 mile) pipeline is designed to
carry gas from the BP Plc-led Shah Deniz field in the  Caspian
Sea  to  Europe  via Turkey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
