Praktiker AG (PRA)  Chief Executive Officer
Thomas Fox opposes calls by the company’s two largest investors
to sell its Eastern Europe business,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing an interview.  It would be difficult to find someone who wants to buy
assets in markets like Greece, Romania, Hungary and Poland given
the current macroeconomic situation, the newspaper cited Fox as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
