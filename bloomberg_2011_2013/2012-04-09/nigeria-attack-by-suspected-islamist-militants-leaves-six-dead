At least six people were killed in
the town of Dikwa, northeast  Nigeria , when suspected Islamist
militants attacked and burnt down a police station and a church,
a military official said.  A former local government chairman, a police sergeant and a
civilian were killed in the attack, along with three suspected
members of the Boko Haram Islamist group, Lieutenant Colonel
Sagir Musa, a military spokesman, said by phone from Maiduguri,
Borno state. “Many escaped with bullet injuries during the
shootout,” he said.  Authorities in Nigeria,  Africa ’s biggest oil producer and
most populous nation, blame Boko Haram, whose name means
“western education is a sin,” for a surge of attacks since
2009 against government buildings and security forces in the
mainly Muslim north and in Abuja, the capital. Those attacks
have caused hundreds of deaths.  In a separate incident yesterday, the six-year-old daughter
of a police corporal was shot and killed in an attack on their
home in the town of Potiskum by suspected Boko Haram members,
said Toyin Gbadegeshin, a police spokesman in Damaturu, Yobe
state.  The police corporal managed to escape, Gbadegeshin said by
phone. “Two other children of the officer, a boy and a girl,
sustained gunshot injuries and are now responding to treatment
at the Potiskum general hospital,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
