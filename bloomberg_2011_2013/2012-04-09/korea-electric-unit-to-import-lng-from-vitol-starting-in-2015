A  Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP)  unit
signed a $3.4 billion agreement with Vitol SA to import
liquefied natural gas for 10 years starting in 2015.  Korea Midland Power Co. plans to take in 400,000 metric
tons of the gas a year from Switzerland-based Vitol, which is
equivalent to a sixth of its consumption of the fuel in 2011,
the  Seoul-based company  said in an e-mailed statement today.  The thermal power generator also has an option to increase
the contracted volumes and resell some cargoes, depending on
global prices, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
