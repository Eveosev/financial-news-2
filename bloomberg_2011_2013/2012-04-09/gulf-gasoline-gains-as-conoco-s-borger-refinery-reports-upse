Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened as
ConocoPhillips reported a “process upset” at its Borger
refinery in Texas.  The event occurred overnight at the 146,000-barrel-a-day
plant, according to a filing with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality. Rich Johnson, a company spokesman,
declined to comment.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  narrowed 1.87 cents to 12.13 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:57
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
fell 6.38 cents to $3.1367 cents a gallon.  The same fuel in New York Harbor weakened 0.75 cent to a
discount of 4 cents a gallon versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
