will assess them and decide on the seven positions, Moeis said.  Rahmat Waluyanto, director general at the finance
ministry’s debt management unit, Nurhaida, head of the capital
market supervisory agency, Firdaus Djaelani, chief executive
officer at the Indonesian deposit insurance agency, and
Riswinandi, vice president director at PT Bank Mandiri, are also

Otoritas Jasa Keuangan or OJK, will start to supervise  capital
markets , pension funds,  finance company  and all non-bank
institutions in early 2013 and start to manage banking
industries in early 2014.  Iljas was former deputy governor of the central bank from
1998 to 2002.  Bank Indonesia  has several deputy governors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
