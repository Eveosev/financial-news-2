Vivus Inc. (VVUS)  said U.S. regulators
delayed their decision date on whether to approve the obesity
pill Qnexa by three months to July 17.  The date was extended after Vivus submitted, at the Food
and Drug Administration’s request, a risk evaluation and
mitigation strategy, the company said today in a statement. The
strategy is based on discussions with the agency after advisers
voted Feb. 22 in favor of the medication, while raising concern
that the drug may potentially contribute to heart risks and
birth defects.  The extension is standard to provide time for a full
review, Vivus said. The  Mountain View , California-based company
is competing with  Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARNA)  and  Orexigen
Therapeutics Inc. (OREX)  to bring the first weight-loss drug to market
in 13 years.  “The Qnexa REMS submission is comprehensive, with
materials based on ongoing feedback from the FDA since our
advisory committee meeting in February,” Leland Wilson, chief
executive officer of Vivus, said in the statement. “We look
forward to finalizing our REMS with the FDA while we move
forward with our commercialization plans.”  Vivus  declined  8.2 percent to $21.03 in extended trading at
7:31 p.m. New York time after gaining 1.7 percent to $22.92 at
the close.  Qnexa raised patients’ heart rates in clinical trials. The
pill is a combination of the appetite suppressant phentermine
and topiramate, an antiseizure and migraine drug.  The company submitted its risk mitigation plan on April 4,
Vivus said in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
