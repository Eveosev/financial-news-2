Jordan’s Aphrodite Trading Co. won a
$240 million contract to build 2,500 housing units in northern
 Iraq , according to Jawhar Hamad, the president of Salahuddin
Investment Commission.  The project will be carried out within three years in the
city of Tikrit, Salahuddin province, Hamad said in a phone
interview today. The province needs 19,800 residential units to
satisfy demand, he said.  Iraq, which holds the world’s fifth-largest crude reserves,
is seeking foreign investment to help rebuild an economy and
infrastructure damaged by years of conflict, sanctions and lack
of investment. In March 2010, the government approved a plan to
build 1 million homes by 2014 for low- and mid-income families
to reduce the country’s housing shortage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
