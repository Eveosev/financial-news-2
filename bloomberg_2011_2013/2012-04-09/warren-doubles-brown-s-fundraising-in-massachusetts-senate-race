Elizabeth Warren , a Democrat seeking
the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts held by Republican  Scott Brown , more than doubled the incumbent’s fundraising during the
first three months of 2012.  Warren brought in $6.9 million, compared with $3.4 million
raised by Brown, according to statements from the campaigns in
advance of the April 15 reporting deadline to the  Federal
Election Commission .  Warren, 62, has raised about $16 million overall for her
campaign, compared with $12 million for Brown, 52. He reported
$15 million in the bank as of March 30 while Warren had about
$11 million, the campaigns said.  Brown, who won a special election in 2010 for the seat that
had been occupied by the late Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy,
is rated with Dean Heller of  Nevada  as the two most endangered
Senate Republicans in this year’s elections by analysts Charlie Cook and Stuart Rothenberg.  Democrats hold several more seats viewed as vulnerable, and
picking up a Republican one could be crucial to maintaining
their majority in the chamber. Democrats control the Senate,
53-47.  Warren served as an adviser to President  Barack Obama ,
helping to set the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that
Congress, over near-unanimous Republican opposition, created
under the new financial regulation law.  Through Dec. 31, Brown’s biggest source of campaign
contributions has been the securities and investment industry,
whose employees have given $1.6 million, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group that
tracks campaign donations.  That’s 13 times the $123,200 Warren raised from that
sector. Warren received almost $500,000 from lawyers, and took
in $300,000 through Emily’s List, a  Washington  group that raises
money for female Democrats who support abortion rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
