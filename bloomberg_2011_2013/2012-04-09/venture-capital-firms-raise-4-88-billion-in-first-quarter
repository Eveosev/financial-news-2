Venture fundraising raised $4.88
billion in the first quarter, the industry’s third-highest tally
since the recession ended, according to the National Venture
Capital Association.  Forty-two U.S. venture funds were created in the first
three months of the year, the NVCA said today in a  statement .
While the amount raised was the highest since the second quarter
of 2009, it fell 35 percent from the year-ago period, when 46
funds reeled in $7.56 billion.  Even as venture firms downshift their investment pace from
a year earlier, they’re benefiting from the best stretch of
Internet initial public offerings in more than a decade.
 LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , Zynga Inc., Groupon Inc. all went public at
multibillion-dollar valuations last year, followed by Yelp Inc.
this year, which is worth $1.4 billion. Facebook Inc. may sell
shares next month at a valuation of as much as $100 billion.  Andreessen Horowitz, based in  Menlo Park , California,
raised the biggest single fund in the quarter, bringing in $1.5
billion from its limited partners.  Canaan Partners  and Bain
Capital Ventures each raised $600 million in the period, while
the biggest new firm to raise capital was Fraser McCombs
Ventures, attracting $16.9 million, the NVCA said.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is an investor
in Andreessen Horowitz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
