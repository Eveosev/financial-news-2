South Korea’s won and India’s rupee
led losses in Asian currencies as weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs
data damped the outlook for the world’s biggest economy, sapping
demand for riskier assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of shares fell for a fourth day
after a government report on April 6 showed U.S. employers added
120,000 jobs in March, less than the 205,000 median estimate in
a Bloomberg survey. Chinese consumer prices increased 3.6
percent in March from a year earlier, compared with the 3.4
percent median forecast in a Bloomberg poll, data showed today.  “Disappointment over the U.S. data is spurring some risk-
averse sentiment in the market,”  Thomas Harr , the Singapore-
based head of Asian foreign-exchange strategy at Standard
Chartered Plc, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. “China’s
CPI was slightly higher than expected which will reduce easing
expectations, which is also not good for risk sentiment.”  The won weakened 0.6 percent to 1,138.32 per dollar at the
3 p.m. close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rupee fell 0.4 percent to 51.2850, Malaysia’s ringgit
dropped 0.3 percent to 3.0725 and Indonesia’s rupiah lost 0.1
percent to 9,176. Financial markets in the Philippines and
Thailand are closed today for holidays.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen, fell 0.1
percent. The gauge’s 60-day historical volatility dropped to
3.32 percent from 3.36 percent at the end of last week.  North Korea Risk  The won touched its weakest level this month as reports
 North Korea  is preparing for a rocket launch and a nuclear
weapons test heightened geopolitical risks on the peninsula. The
North announced last month through state media that it intends
to fire a long-range rocket to put a satellite in orbit between
April 12 and April 16. North Korea appears to be readying a
nuclear weapons test to follow a long-range rocket launch,
according to a report by South Korean intelligence officials.  “Reports that North Korea may launch a rocket near the end
of this week is tilting market sentiment toward a weaker won,”
said Ryoo Hyun Jung, the Seoul-based chief currency dealer at
Citibank Korea Inc.  The yuan slipped 0.02 percent to 6.3077 per dollar after
the People’s Bank of  China  set its  reference rate  0.08 percent
stronger at 6.3021. The currency is allowed to trade 0.5 percent
on either side of the daily fixing.  “The CPI number was very high and disappointing,” said  Ju Wang , a rates strategist at  Barclays Capital  in Singapore.
“It’s bad for sentiment as it may delay a reserve-requirement
cut.” Barclays has predicted a reduction this month.  Elsewhere, the  Taiwan dollar  advanced 0.1 percent to
NT$29.530 against its U.S. counterpart. Vietnam’s dong was
steady at 20,835.  To contact the reporters on this story:
