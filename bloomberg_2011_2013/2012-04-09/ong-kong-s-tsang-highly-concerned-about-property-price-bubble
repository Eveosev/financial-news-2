Hong Kong  Financial Secretary  John Tsang  said he’s ready to step in if there are signs of
overheating in the property market and warned property buyers
not to “blindly” follow the market.  “I remain highly concerned about the risk of a price
bubble” as the low interest environment persists, Tsang said in
a Chinese-language blog posting on a government website
yesterday.  Hong Kong’s housing  prices  rose more than 70 percent
between the start of 2009 and mid-2011 on record low mortgage
rates and an influx of mainland Chinese buyers. Prices have
risen almost 4 percent this year, after falling about 5 percent
in the second half, according to an index compiled by Centaline
Property Agency Ltd.  Buyers shouldn’t believe that property prices will only
rise and never fall, Tsang said.  The government is “determined” to increase land supply
and will continue with measures to maintain stable  home prices ,
Tsang said in a Feb. 1 annual budget address.  To contact the reporter on this story:
