Sanofi’s (SNY)  two patents on the cancer
drug Taxotere were ruled invalid and unenforceable by a U.S.
court today in a victory for generic-drug makers  Hospira Inc. (HSP) 
and Apotex Inc.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit upheld a
lower court finding on the two patents. The  decision  was posted
on the court’s website.  Taxotere, the successor to the cancer drug Taxol, generated
922 million euros ($1.2 billion) last year for Paris-based
Sanofi. That’s a 57 percent drop from the year before because of
generic-drug competition, Sanofi said Feb. 8.  The Federal Circuit, which specializes in U.S. patent
cases, said a judge was correct to rule that the two patents
were obvious variations of earlier research, and that the
inventor misled the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to obtain
the patents by withholding that earlier know-how.  Sanofi (SAN)  was disappointed by the appeals court decision on
the patents for Taxotere and is evaluating its options, said
Carrie Brown, a spokeswoman. Hospira said it was pleased with
the decision.  “Hospira is committed to continuing to provide U.S. cancer
patients with high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to branded
oncology products,” said Dan Rosenberg, a spokesman for  Lake
Forest , Illinois-based Hospira.  The case is Aventis Pharma SA v. Hospira Inc., 11-1018,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower court case is Aventis Pharma SA v. Hospira Inc. and Apotex
Inc., 07CV721, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To see the patents, click: 5,714,512 and 5,750,561.  To contact the reporter on this story:
