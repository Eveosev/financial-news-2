Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW) , the largest
U.S. paint retailer, reported preliminary first-quarter earnings
that exceeded its guidance and analysts’ estimates amid rising
demand and prices.  Net income rose to 92 cents to 95 cents a share, from 63
cents a year earlier, Cleveland-based Sherwin-Williams said
today in a statement. The average profit  estimate  of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 72 cents, while the company in January
forecast profit of 56 cents to 74 cents.  Paint-store revenue increased about 20 percent because of
improved sales volumes for architectural paint and higher
prices, said Sherwin-Williams, which also produces paint.  PPG
Industries Inc. (PPG) , the world’s second-biggest paint maker, on
April 5 posted first-quarter earnings that were better than
expected and said mild winter weather in the U.S. boosted sales.  Sherwin-Williams rose 1 percent to $111.83 at the close in
New York. The shares gained 26 percent this year.  Complete first-quarter results will be announced on April
19, the company said.  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA)  is the world’s biggest paint maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
