The mutual-fund rankings were
created using two Bloomberg functions. We used the Fund
Screening (FSRC) function to generate separate lists of funds
for global and U.S. equities and global and U.S. bonds.  All searches included only active, open-end, U.S.-domiciled
funds with more than $250 million in total assets. We excluded
institutional-class, index, sector and market-neutral funds. For
global equity and global bond funds, we limited the universe to
funds with at least one-third of their assets invested outside
the U.S. For the U.S. bond ranking, we included only
intermediate/long funds.  We used the Fund Scoring (FSCO) function to create a
scoring model with five criteria: total returns for one, three
and five years and Sharpe ratios for three and five years, all
as of Feb. 17. Sharpe ratios were added because they show how
well the return of a fund compensates investors for the risk
taken. A fund that takes substantial risk to produce a high
return may score a lower ratio than a fund that takes less risk
and gets a lower return.  We gave equal weight to the five criteria. Each of the
funds in our customized mutual-fund searches was ranked using
this scoring model. The winning funds were those that received
the highest scores.  To contact the reporters on this story:
