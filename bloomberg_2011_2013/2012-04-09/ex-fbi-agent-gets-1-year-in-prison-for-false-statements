An ex-FBI agent accused of making
false statements about a confidential informant was sentenced to
12 months and a day in prison.  Adrian Busby, 38, a former agent for the  Federal Bureau  of
Investigation, was convicted by a federal jury in November of
four counts of making false statements about his use of a
confidential source in a mortgage-fraud investigation.
Prosecutors said Busby had begun an intimate relationship with
the informant, an unidentified woman, in 2008.  Busby assisted the woman’s defense after she was arrested
by New York police in February 2008 and prosecuted for  identity
theft , according to the government. He was sentenced today by
U.S. District Judge Harold Baer in  Manhattan .  Busby made “numerous false statements regarding the
confidential source and the steps he took to assist her in
connection with her trial,” prosecutors alleged.  Busby falsely stated that she wasn’t the subject or target
of any criminal investigation by police or prosecutors when he
knew she was, the U.S. alleged. He also falsely stated in an
official FBI report that he hadn’t intentionally provided her
defense attorney with the official reports, authorities said.  The woman was convicted in December 2009, prosecutors said.  The case is U.S. v. Busby, 11-cr-370, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
