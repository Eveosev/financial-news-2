U.S. employment growth that trailed
economists’ forecasts in March presents a challenge that stocks
have overcome nine times during the  bull market  that’s driven
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index up 107 percent in three years.  The Labor Department’s monthly tally of U.S. hiring missed
the median projection by 85,000, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. While the  S&P 500 (SPX)  averaged losses of 0.8 percent in
the day after shortfalls of this magnitude since March 2009, the
benchmark gauge cut its decline in half a week later and was up
0.9 percent after two weeks, the data show.  The S&P 500 lost 1.1 percent today after the April 6 report
renewed concern about the pace of the U.S. recovery. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s March 26 pledge to keep
“accommodative” monetary policy to stimulate jobs may cushion
the blow, said U.S. Trust Co.’s Chris Hyzy and National
Securities Corp.’s  Donald Selkin . So will corporate earnings,
said  Wells Fargo & Co .’s Ann Miletti.  “With a bad number, the thought is, well, the Fed has
ammunition,” Hyzy, who helps oversee about $325 billion as
chief investment officer of U.S. Trust in New York, said in an
April 6 telephone interview. “The market comes back after a
drop. The only way they add liquidity is if it looks like the
economic recovery is receding.”  Last Week  The  S&P 500  slumped 0.7 percent to 1,398.08 last week after
the Fed signaled it may refrain from monetary stimulus and
concern intensified about  Europe ’s debt crisis. The index
rallied to the highest level since May 2008 on April 2, a week
after Bernanke said reducing the jobless rate “can be supported
by continued accommodative policies.”  The Labor Department’s monthly report trailed economists’
projections by 85,000 or more twice in 2009, four times in 2010
and three times in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The S&P 500 tumbled 3.4 percent on June 4, 2010, for
the biggest one-day slump. Two weeks later, the benchmark
measure of U.S. stocks was up 1.2 percent from its June 3 close.  Stocks surged in the month after the government’s statement
on July 2, 2009, when the report fell short of projections by
102,000 jobs. The S&P 500 rose 5.6 percent in four weeks,
recovering from a 2.9 percent loss on the first day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The index posted one-month gains
even after shortfalls were announced in October and December of
2010 and February and June of 2011.  Global Retreat  Equities slumped around the world last week after the Fed
signaled it will hold off on more monetary stimulus unless the
U.S. economic expansion falters or prices rise at a rate slower
than its 2 percent target. Minutes from Fed policy makers’ March
13 meeting showed less urgency to add stimulus.  Weaker demand at a Spanish government debt auction fueled
concern the global economic recovery will slow.  Spain  sold 2.59
billion euros ($3.4 billion) of bonds due between 2015 and 2020,
compared with a planned maximum of 3.5 billion euros.  “The combination of the European problem and slow job
growth may prompt the Fed to do something,” Selkin, the New
York-based chief market strategist at National Securities, which
manages about $3 billion, said in an April 6 phone interview.
“That’s the only silver lining behind the cloud.”  The S&P 500’s  valuation  has climbed 20 percent to 14.3
times earnings since reaching a two-year low of 11.9 in October.
The gain reflects an overestimation of U.S. economic growth
mirroring 2011, according to Bill Fleckenstein, president of
Fleckenstein Capital Inc. in  Seattle . Forecasts for expansion in
U.S. gross domestic product last year fell from 3.2 percent in
March to 1.6 percent in September, according to surveys of
economists by Bloomberg.  Carried Away  “People got all excited and carried away with themselves”
since October, Fleckenstein said in an April 8 phone interview.
“When we look at the next three months, it’ll be back to the
same subpar, weak economy stuff we’ve been going through for the
past three years.”  After increasing by 251,000 in April 2011, the most in a
year, average growth in nonfarm payrolls slipped to 80,000 over
the next four months, missing economists’ projections three
times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500
slumped 19 percent from April 29 through Oct. 3.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the New York-based aluminum producer, is
scheduled to disclose first-quarter results tomorrow, the first
Dow Jones Industrial Average company to report. While S&P 500
per-share profit growth slowed to 0.8 percent during the period
from 4.9 percent in the  fourth quarter  and 15 percent in the
three months ended in September, it will accelerate to 8.3
percent during all of 2012, according to analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Earnings aren’t at risk,” Ann Miletti, a senior  money
manager  for Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in  Menomonee Falls ,
 Wisconsin , said in an April 6 phone interview. Her firm manages
$213 billion. “We spend a lot of time with management teams,
and I see more optimism this year than I did even at the end of
last year, so I’m thinking that that should bode well.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
