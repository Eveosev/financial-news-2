Lamar Odom’s four-month tenure with
the  Dallas Mavericks  ended midway through a National Basketball
Association season in which the forward is averaging career lows
in minutes, points and rebounds.  Odom, 32, will remain on the  Dallas  roster for the
remainder of the season and won’t play again for the Mavericks
under a mutual agreement, team spokeswoman Sarah Melton said
today in an e-mail. The move gives Dallas the postseason option
of trading Odom, who is unable to compete in the playoffs for
another team because he wasn’t waived before the league’s March
23 deadline.  Any team that has Odom on its roster on June 29 must either
buy out his contract for $2.4 million or pay the full $8.2
million he is set to make next season, according to ESPN.  Odom is in his first year with the defending-champion
Mavericks after spending the previous seven with the  Los Angeles
Lakers . He started four games for Dallas and is averaging 20.5
minutes, 6.6 points and 4.2 rebounds, all career lows.  Odom played just 4:15 in the team’s last game, a 94-89
victory against the  Memphis Grizzlies  on April 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
