Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its oil, increased purchases in March to support
processing at Formosa Petrochemical Corp.  Shipments climbed to 27.4 million barrels last month, up
7.8 percent from a year earlier, the  Ministry of Finance  said
today in Taipei. The island’s March payments for oil jumped 27
percent to $3.32 billion, the ministry said in a statement.  Formosa Petrochemical, Taiwan’s only publicly traded oil
refiner, processed 69,000 barrels more crude a day on average in
March than a year earlier, it said in an April 3 statement.
Crude prices rose in the first quarter as the  U.S. economy 
improved and sanctions targeting  Iran  raised supply concerns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
