South Korea ’s won slid to the lowest
this month and  government bonds  gained as reports the North is
preparing for a rocket launch and a nuclear weapons test
heightened geopolitical risks on the peninsula.  North Korea announced last month through state media that
it intends to fire a long-range rocket to put a satellite in
orbit between April 12 and April 16. South Korea’s Yonhap News
reported yesterday that the North is also preparing for an
underground nuclear weapons test. A ministry spokesman said in
 Seoul  today the government isn’t aware of the North’s nuclear
test plans. Hiring by American employers rose 120,000 in March,
trailing the most pessimistic forecast, data showed on April 6.  “Reports that  North Korea  may launch a rocket near the end
of this week is tilting  market sentiment  toward a weaker won,”
said Ryoo Hyun Jung, a Seoul-based chief currency dealer at
Citibank Inc. “The U.S. job data’s effect on the won is less
clear, as it can be a dollar-weakening factor as well.”  The won fell 0.6 percent to 1,138.63 per dollar as of 9:13
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,138.71, the lowest since March 29. One-month implied
volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, gained 22 basis points to 8.40 percent. South
Korea’s financial markets are closed on April 11 for a holiday.  North Korean space officials have moved all three stages of
a long-range rocket into position at the launch site, the
 Associated Press  reported yesterday. South Korean  producer
prices  climbed 2.8 percent from a year earlier in March, the
smallest gain in two years, the  Bank of Korea  said in a
statement in Seoul today.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.49
percent in Seoul, the lowest since March 13, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. Three-year debt futures rose 0.16 today to 104.00
and one-year interest-rate swaps slid three basis points to 3.52
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
