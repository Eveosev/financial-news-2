South Korea ’s  stocks  fell to a one-
month low and the won weakened as speculation the North is
preparing for a rocket launch and a nuclear weapons test
heightened geopolitical risks on the peninsula.  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  sank 1.6 percent to 1,997.08, its
lowest close since March 7. The won declined 0.6 percent to
1,138.32 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,138.90 earlier, the lowest level since March 29.
Equities and the currency also dropped as U.S. jobs data missed
estimates.  North Korea announced last month through state media that
it intends to fire a long-range rocket to put a satellite in
orbit between April 12 and April 16. The Pyongyang regime
appears to be in the final stages of preparations for an
underground nuclear test to follow the rocket launch, according
to a report compiled by South Korean intelligence officials.  North Korea concerns “could be a short-term drag on the
market as it reminds investors of the so-called Korea
discount,” said Han Sang Soo, a  fund manager  at Seoul-based
Samsung Asset Management Co., which oversees about $30 billion
in assets. “That, combined with the U.S. job market data, may
weigh on sentiment in the near term.”  South Korea sent 10 percent of its total outbound shipments
to the U.S. last year, according to government data. Hiring by
American employers rose 120,000 in March, data showed on April
6, trailing the most pessimistic economist forecast.  Rocket Launch  South Korea, Japan and  China  expressed concern over North
Korea’s plan to launch a rocket as it raises tension in the
region. North Korean space officials have moved all three stages
of a long-range rocket into position at the launch site, the
Associated Press reported yesterday.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , South Korea biggest exporter of
consumer electronics, slipped 1.1 percent to 1.317 million won,
while  KB Financial Group Inc. (105560) , owner of South Korea’s largest
bank, dropped 2.6 percent to 41,600 won.  Victek Co. (065450) , a South Korean maker of electronic warfare
equipment, led gains in the country’s defense-related stocks
today. Victek surged by the daily limit of 15 percent to 3,260
won, while  Speco Co. (013810)  jumped 15 percent to 3,895 won.  Huneed
Technologies (005870) , a military communication equipment maker, rallied
15 percent to 4,600 won.  One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, gained 43 basis
points to 8.6 percent. The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent
bonds due December 2014 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.50 percent in Seoul, the lowest since
March 13, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.  “Reports that  North Korea  may launch a rocket near the end
of this week is tilting market sentiment toward a weaker won,”
said Ryoo Hyun Jung, a Seoul-based chief currency dealer at
Citibank Korea Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
