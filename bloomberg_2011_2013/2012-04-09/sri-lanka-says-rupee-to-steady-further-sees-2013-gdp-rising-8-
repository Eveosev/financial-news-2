Sri Lanka ’s rupee will stabilize
further and economic expansion may accelerate to 8 percent next
year from 7.2 percent in 2012, the island’s central bank said.  Inflation will remain in “single-digit” levels this year
even as “high and volatile” food and energy costs add to
uncertainty about price movements, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka
said in its annual  report  released in Colombo today.  The nation raised  interest rates  last week for the second
time in 2012 to damp credit growth and inflation, extending the
biggest overhaul of economic policy since its civil war ended in
2009. Officials let the rupee weaken to a record low and raised
fuel prices under the measures, seeking to pare demand for
imports such as oil, restrain the trade deficit and shield
foreign-exchange reserves.  The reserves have climbed since mid-March and Sri Lanka
will aim to rebuild them, Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said in
 Colombo  today at the release of the report. The rupee will
probably stabilize further and the balance-of-payments will have
a surplus of $1.2 billion in 2012, he also said.  The currency, which has weakened about 8.2 percent in
2012, was little changed at 125.65 per dollar at 1:35 p.m. local
time. It appreciated about 2 percent last week, aided by the
International Monetary Fund’s decision on April 2 to disburse a
$426.8 million loan tranche to the $50 billion economy.  The central bank raised borrowing costs on Feb. 3 for the
first time since 2007. Officials scrapped a trading band for the
rupee on Feb. 9 and boosted energy costs from Feb. 12. The IMF
said February’s steps will put the economy on a “more
sustainable trajectory.”  Accelerating Inflation  Inflation accelerated to a six-month high of 5.5 percent in
March on energy costs. The trade deficit was $966 million in
January 2012, compared with $645 million a year earlier.  Improvements in supply conditions will help to restrain
price increases, the central bank said today. On April 5, it
raised the  reverse repurchase  rate to 9.75 percent from 9
percent and the  repurchase rate  to 7.75 percent from 7.5
percent.  The monetary authority may raise rates by 50 basis points
to 75 basis points in the coming three-to-six months because of
concern about credit growth,  Barclays Capital  said in an e-
mailed note today.  Sri Lanka’s monetary tightening contrasts with rate cuts in
nations from  Brazil  to the  Philippines  in recent months, as
officials in  emerging markets  move to shield growth from the
impact of  Europe ’s debt crisis on exports.  The central bank estimated 8.3 percent gross domestic
product growth in 2014.  The economy is posting strong expansion after the end of
the 26-year civil conflict, President  Mahinda Rajapaksa  said in
Colombo today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
