The  Federal Reserve  may commit to
more asset purchases “later this summer” to boost growth if
the economy slows, said  Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody’s
Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania.  “The bar is pretty low for additional quantitative easing,
QE, if the economy does continue to weaken,” Zandi said on
Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with Betty Liu today. “I
don’t think the Federal Reserve at this point needs to do
anything additional,” he said. “Odds for another round of QE
are less than even.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
