Azeri crude exports through the BP
Plc-operated Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline fell 7.8 percent to
7.93 million metric tons in the first quarter from the same
period a year earlier.  As of April 1, the pipeline, also known as the BTC, has
carried 183.7 million tons of crude since it started in 2005,
State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan , or Socar, said on its website
today.  The Baku, Azerbaijan-based energy producer, which is a
partner in the BTC, gave no reason for the decline.  In 2011, Azerbaijan’s oil output declined to 45.4 million
metric tons, or about 911,000 barrels a day, from 50.8 million
tons a year earlier. Gas production fell 2.4 percent to 25.7
billion cubic meters.  The Caspian Sea nation, which is the third-largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , also uses two smaller
export pipelines, running from Baku to the Black Sea ports of
Supsa and Novorossiysk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
