Dmitri Tulin, a former deputy head
of  Russia ’s central bank, may join the board of state lender OAO
Sberbank as an independent director,  Vedomosti  reported, citing
bank documents.  Tulin, who now works for Deloitte, has also been nominated
for the board of closely held MDM bank, the newspaper said,
citing Oleg Viyugin, MDM’s chairman.  Tulin, who left the central bank in 2006, may need to chose
between the two positions, as Sberbank sees a conflict of
interests if Tulin works for MDM, Vedomosti said, citing an
unidentified Sberbank official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
