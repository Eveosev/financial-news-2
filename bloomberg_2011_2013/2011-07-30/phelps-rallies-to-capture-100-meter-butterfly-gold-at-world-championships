Michael Phelps of the U.S. came from
behind to retain his 100-meter butterfly title at the world
swimming championships in  Shanghai .  Phelps, a 14-time Olympic gold medalist, was third after 50
meters before winning in 50.71 seconds over Konrad Czerniak of
Poland and Tyler McGill of the U.S.  “I want to be faster,” Phelps, the world-record holder in
the race at 49.82 seconds, told reporters. “Sometimes I need to
judge what I can do better. I need definitely to push in the
first 50 meters.”  The gold medal was Phelps’s third in Shanghai after winning
the 200-meter butterfly and being part of the U.S.’s winning
800-meter freestyle relay team. He’s also taken two silvers and
a bronze in his return to China after winning eight gold medals
at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.  American teenager Missy Franklin also made it three golds
at the championships by winning the women’s 200-meter backstroke
and helping the U.S. to victory in the 400-meter medley relay.
The 16-year-old also won in the 800-meter freestyle relay
earlier in the week.  “This is obviously the meet of my life,” Franklin said in
an interview with Eurosport.  Natalie Coughlin, Rebecca Soni and Dana Vollmer were also
part of the U.S. team, which had a time of 3 minutes, 52.36
seconds, 0.17 second off  China ’s world record.  Britain, Netherlands  Olympic champion Rebecca Adlington won Great Britain’s
first gold of the championships in the 800-meter freestyle.
Adlington overtook defending champ Lotte Friis of  Denmark  in a
time of 8 minutes, 17.51 seconds, with Kate Ziegler of the U.S.
in third.  Inge Dekker of the Netherlands won the women’s 50-meter
butterfly and  Brazil ’s Cesar Cielo Filho took the men’s 50-meter
freestyle gold medal.  The championships, which conclude tomorrow, are the last
