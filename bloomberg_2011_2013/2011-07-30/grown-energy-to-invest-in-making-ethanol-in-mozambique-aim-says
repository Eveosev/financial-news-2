Grown Energy Zambeze Ltda. will
invest $320 million to make ethanol from sugar cane in the
central Mozambican province of Sofala, state-controlled Agencia
de Informacao de Mocambique reported.  Production is scheduled to start in 2013, the Maputo-based
 news agency  said on its website today, citing Rademan Rensburg,
the companyâ€™s managing director. Grown Energy aims to produce
25,000 liters (6,600 gallons) of the biofuel initially,
increasing to 100,000 liters in three years, it said.  Grown Energy, which has shareholders in South Africa and
Asia as well as Mozambique, is raising sugar cane on 24,000
hectares (59,300 acres) to supply the local market and export to
the European Union, the agency cited Rensburg as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
