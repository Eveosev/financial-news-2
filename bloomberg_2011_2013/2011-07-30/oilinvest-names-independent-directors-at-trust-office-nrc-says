Oilinvest BV registered three
Dutchmen as independent directors at trust office Stichting
Administratiekantoor Oilinvest, Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad
reported, citing data from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.  The directors include Arthur Docters van Leeuwen, Flip
Klopper and Peter Waaijer, NRC Handelsblad said.  The  Libyan Investment Authority , which owns Ridderkerk,
Netherlands-based Oilinvest, has been placed at a greater
distance by the appointments, the newspaper said. Oilinvest had
said earlier its profit wonâ€™t be transferred to the Libyan
Investment Authority, NRC said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
