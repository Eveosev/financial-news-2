Adani Enterprises Ltd. (ADE) , India’s
biggest coal importer, said linking it to illegal mining is
“far-fetched” because it hasn’t owned  iron ore  assets or mined
the raw material in any part of the country.  The stock fell 21.4 percent yesterday, the most since it
began trading on the exchanges in November 1994. Adani
Enterprises led declines among Indian miners, after a newspaper
reported that the Karnataka state’s anti-corruption ombudsman
accused the companies of procuring and exporting iron ore
illegally.  “Adani has never had any mining interest in iron-ore
directly or indirectly anywhere in India, let alone in
Karnataka,” the Ahmedabad-based company said today in a
statement to BSE Ltd. “Linking Adani’s name with illegal mining
is far-fetched to say the least.”  Santosh Hegde, the anti-corruption investigator of
Karnataka, sent a 25,000-page report to the government on July
27, naming political leaders, companies and officials involved
in a mining scam that may have cost the southern state 160
billion rupees ($3.6 billion) in lost revenue.  India ’s top court
yesterday banned mining in the Bellary area in Karnataka after
the report.  Adani was one of four parties providing services as a port
operator at Belekeri, it said in today’s statement. It
discontinued the operations as a port operator at Belekeri in
June 2010, it said.  “The company conducts its business within the framework
laws and would defend its legal position vigorously,” Adani
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
