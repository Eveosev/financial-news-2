National Football League players
have enough votes to recertify their union, the  Associated Press 
reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the vote
count it didnâ€™t idenfiy.  Recertification is one of the last steps in completing the
collective bargaining agreement, AP said. The union would be
required to negotiate with the NFL on several outstanding items,
such as drug testing, player discipline, disability and pension
programs, AP said.  Representatives for the players unanimously approved a 10-
year labor agreement five days ago, ending a four-month
shutdown. The owners voted 31-0 to approve the agreement on July
21.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
