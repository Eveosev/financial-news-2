Rwanda capped the wholesale cost of
local sugar at 36,000 Rwandan francs ($60) for a 50-kilogram
(110-pound) bag after prices gained, the Ministry of Trade and
Industry said in a statement late yesterday.  Wholesale and retail prices for the sweetener have been
rising since May, according to Emmanuel Hategeka, the ministryâ€™s
permanent secretary. Sugar has climbed to 1,000 francs a
kilogram from about 780 francs in April, he said today by text
message.  Raw sugar gained 13 percent in July on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York , extending the three-month advance to 34 percent.
White, or refined, sugar traded on NYSE Liffe in London rose 26
percent in the same span.  To contact the reporter on this story:
