Air  Zimbabwe  grounded flights after
pilots held a strike for the second time in 30 days, the state-
controlled  Herald  said, citing Moses Mapanda, the airlineâ€™s
acting chief executive officer.  Pilots for the state-owned business are demanding unpaid
salaries and allowances for June and July, the Harare-based
Herald said on its website. The strike left hundreds of
passengers stranded, it said.  Air Zimbabwe operates flights within Zimbabwe as well as to
international destinations such as London and Beijing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
