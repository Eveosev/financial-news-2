Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd. (TGR)  may curb
its business in Australia, the  Straits Times  reported.  Chin Yau Seng, whose appointment as acting chief executive
officer will begin at the end of July, didn’t rule out a
possible downsizing of operations during an interview yesterday,
the Singapore paper said.  Australian regulators extended a fight ban on the budget
carrier until Aug. 4 because of safety concern. Vanessa Regan,
head of communications and marketing in Melbourne, didn’t
immediately reply to an e-mail and a call to her mobile phone
seeking comment outside office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
