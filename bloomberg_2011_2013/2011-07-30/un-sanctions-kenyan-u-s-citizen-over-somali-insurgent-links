The  United Nations Security Council 
imposed travel bans and asset freezes on a Kenyan-born man and a
U.S. citizen over their links to al-Shabaab, the al-Qaeda linked
insurgency group.  Hassan Mahat Omar, a 32-year-old Imam, was sanctioned for
engaging in acts that threaten peace, security or stability in
Somalia, the council said in a statement on the UN’s website
yesterday. Omar is a leader of Masjid-ul-Axmar, an informal al-
Shabaab affiliated center in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, and is
involved in recruiting new members and soliciting funds for al-
Shabaab, it said.  The council also imposed the bans on Omar Hammani, a 27-
year-old man from  Alabama  who it said is a “senior member” of
al-Shabaab. Hammani is involved in recruitment, finance and
payroll for foreign fighters in Somalia and is described as an
explosives expert, it said.  The bans bring to 11 the number of groups and individuals
targeted by the UN over the conflict in Somalia. The  list 
includes al-Shabaab, which has waged a four-year insurgency
against the Horn of  Africa ’s Western-backed government, and
Hassan Dahir Aweys, who heads an alliance of groups opposed to
Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed’s administration.  Somalia has been mired in a civil war for two decades and
hasn’t had a functioning central government since the 1991
ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
