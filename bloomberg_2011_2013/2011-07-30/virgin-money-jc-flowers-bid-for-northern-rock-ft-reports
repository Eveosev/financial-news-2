Virgin Money Ltd. and JC Flowers
filed formal bids to buy Northern Rock Plc before the first
deadline for offers on July 28, the  Financial Times  said today,
citing unidentified people familiar with the process.  The U.K. government, which took over the bank when it
collapsed in 2007, may receive about 1 billion pounds ($1.6
billion) for Northern Rock, the paper said. Blackstone Group LP
was also named by newspapers as a possible bidder, though it
didn’t hand in an offer, the Financial Times said.  Northern Rock spokeswoman Andrea Coleman declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Virgin Money and JC
Flowers spokesmen weren’t immediately available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
