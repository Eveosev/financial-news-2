Indianapolis Colts quarterback
 Peyton Manning  has agreed to a five-year, $90 million contract,
ESPN reported on its website.  Manning’s $18 million-per-year deal matches Tom Brady’s as
the highest in the  National Football League . Colts owner Jim
Irsay wanted to make Manning the league’s best-paid player, but
the four-time MVP had been resisting the offer, ESPN said.  Manning, 35, underwent surgery in May to repair a bulging
disc in his neck and his goal is to be ready for the start of
the regular season. He’s started 208 straight games, the longest
among active playrs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
