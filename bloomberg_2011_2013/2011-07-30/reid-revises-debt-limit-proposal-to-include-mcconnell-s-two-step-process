Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid 
revised his debt-limit proposal to adopt a two-step procedure
modeled after one proposed by Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell 
that would let the president raise the ceiling in two steps
unless a supermajority of Congress blocked it.  According to a summary of the new plan, the borrowing
authority would be provided in two separate $1.2 trillion
installments, one immediately, and one in several months, the
next time the nation nears its borrowing limit.  All but the first $416 billion could be blocked through a
joint resolution of Congress, though opponents would have to
muster supermajorities in both chambers to override a veto.  The new plan would yield debt savings of $2.4 trillion --
the same as the total borrowing authority extended -- and call
on a 12-member bipartisan congressional committee to draft
legislation to lower the deficit to 3 percent or less of gross
domestic product.  The panel would be directed to consider other bipartisan
plans, the summary said, such as the one proposed by the “Gang
of Six,” a group of three Republicans and three Democrats that
negotiated a package to shave $3.7 trillion off the long-term
debt over a decade through a mix of spending cuts and tax
increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
