AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA)  Chief Executive Officer
 Tony Fernandes  may buy Queens Park Rangers soccer club for 100
million pounds ($164 million), the U.K.’s Daily Mail reported
without saying where it obtained the information.  Queens Park Rangers, promoted to English soccer’s Premier
League at the end of last season, said in a July 28 statement it
has entered talks with a second potential buyer.  Fernandes didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail and two
phone calls from Bloomberg to his office in  Malaysia ’s capital,
 Kuala Lumpur . The U.K. newspaper said Fernandes has been shown
around Loftus Road, where the club is located, and talked to
manager Neil Warnock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
