Manchester City and  Inter Milan  will
hold talks this weekend over a possible trade involving  Carlos
Tevez  and Samuel Eto’o, the Daily Telegraph said.  Both clubs are in Dublin for a preseason tournament and the
deal being proposed is a straight swap that values each player
at about 40 million pounds ($66 million), the Telegraph said.
City is anxious to move Tevez, who wants to leave, after signing
Sergio Aguero this week from Atletico Madrid, the newspaper
said.  Eto’o is trying to negotiate a new contract at Inter,
without success, and is open to a move to England. He scored 21
goals last season, while Tevez tied Dimitar Berbatov for the
Premier League lead with 20 goals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
