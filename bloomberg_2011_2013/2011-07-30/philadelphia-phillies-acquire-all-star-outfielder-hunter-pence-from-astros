The  Philadelphia Phillies , who have
the best record in  Major League Baseball  this season, acquired
All-Star right fielder Hunter Pence from the Houston Astros in
exchange for four players.  Pence, 28, who is hitting .308 with 11 home runs and 62
runs batted in this season, was removed from the game in the
middle of Houston’s loss at  Milwaukee  last night. The Astros,
35-71, have the worst record in baseball this year.  “I think every competitor at the highest level wants to
be in a pennant race, wants to be in a World Series,” Pence
told reporters in Milwaukee. “I’m pretty lucky now I get to
jump on board with one of the best teams.”  The Phillies (66-39) lead the National League East
Division by five games over the Atlanta Braves. Philadelphia
lost in the NL Championship Series last season to the  San
Francisco  Giants after making it to the  World Series  in 2008
and 2009.  Philadelphia said in a news release last night that it
sent three minor leaguers to the Astros -- first baseman
Jonathan Singleton and right-handed pitchers Jarred Cosart and
Josh Zeid.  The Astros also will get a player to be announced later,
and the Phillies will get an undisclosed amount of cash in
addition to Pence, Philadelphia General Manager Ruben Amaro Jr.
said in the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
