Laird Plc (LRD) , the biggest maker of
electronic shields for laptops and televisions, said  Cooper
Industries Plc (CBE)  is unwilling to lift its bid to 220 pence a
share, as the suitor said it’s “frustrated” by the stalemate.  Laird, based in London, had proposed meeting today with
managers at Houston-based Cooper to provide “value related
information” that would help persuade the suitor to increase
its bid, the U.K. company said in an e-mailed statement.  Cooper responded that a price of 220 pence was not
“appropriate or justifiable,” according to a release. The
higher offer would value Laird at 585.9 million pounds ($963
million), based on the number of shares outstanding.  “Cooper confirmed it was not prepared to meet in these
circumstances,” Laird said. “In particular, Cooper has
confirmed that it is not prepared to contemplate an offer at a
level of 220 pence per share.”  Cooper, which makes electrical-distribution equipment, said
July 27 it would consider offering 200 pence a share, up from
its prior indicative bid of 185 pence, with the potential to
increase the offer further subject to being allowed to do due
diligence. The additional information it was willing to provide
wouldn’t constitute due diligence, Laird said today.  “We are frustrated,” Cooper Chairman Kirk Hachigian said
in today’s statement. “We have been clear that we have some
flexibility on price and are keen to review any information
provided by Laird to see if a deal can be done. However we don’t
think we can justify the 220 pence -- ex dividend -- per share
which Laird says it requires.”  Laird rose 2.6 percent to 187.7 pence in  London  trading
yesterday, boosting its market value to 499.9 million pounds.
The company said July 27 its first-half loss widened to 113
million pounds, or 42.6 pence a share, from 12.3 million pounds,
or 4.6 pence, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
