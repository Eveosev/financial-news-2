INA Industrija Nafte d.d., a
Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt., returned to
profit in the first half as increased production at its Syrian
and Adriatic operations boosted revenue.  Net income rose to 1.9 billion kuna ($367 million) from a
loss of 108 million kuna in the year-earlier period, the company
said today in a statement. Revenue advanced to 14.7 billion kuna
from 11.3 billion kuna, while earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization rose to 4 billion kuna from 2.5
billion kuna.  INA returned to profit last year following two years of
losses. Mol, which secured managing rights in a 2009 contract
with the Croatian government, owns 47.47 percent of INA, with an
option to buy another 1.6 percent. The government holds a 44.84
percent stake.  Tensions between the two shareholders increased after Mol
made an offer to purchase the company’s outstanding shares in
December. The government claimed it had not been notified of
Mol’s intention prior to the offer.  INA’s stock has been suspended from trading at the Zagreb
 stock exchange  since April, as  Croatia ’s market regulator has
filed charges against Mol claiming market manipulation in
purchasing INA shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
