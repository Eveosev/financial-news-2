Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , the largest
producer of the metal in Peru and Mexico, said second-quarter
profit more than doubled after copper prices and output
increased.  Net income climbed to $658 million, or 78 cents a share,
from $313.4 million, or 37 cents, from the same period a year
earlier, the Phoenix-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. Profit, excluding items, was expected to be 74 cents
a share, the average estimate of nine analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  Sales increased 54 percent to $1.8 billion from $1.17
billion as New York-traded copper futures averaged 30 percent
higher in the quarter than a year ago and silver prices doubled.
Southern also benefited from the restart of its Buenavista
copper mine in  Mexico , following a three-year strike. The mine
was formerly known as Cananea.  “It was a strong quarter thanks to both higher prices and
production,” Daniel Mori, a mining analyst at Lima-based
brokerage Inteligo SAB, said in a phone interview before the
report was released. “But the company isn’t getting the full
benefit of prices due to its conservative hedging policy.”  Southern hedged 32 percent of its 2011 copper output at
$4.08 per pound and 30 percent with an average floor price of
$3.02 a pound and a maximum price of $4.84 a pound. The
remaining 38 percent isn’t hedged.  Mori, who rates the stock a “buy,” doesn’t own any.  Copper for September delivery rose 1 cent to $4.4795 a
pound yesterday on the Comex division of the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  ( Southern Copper  will hold its quarterly conference call
