Fidelity International Ltd. fund
manager  Anthony Bolton  urged the U.S. to close a loophole that
allows Chinese companies to list on its exchanges through
reverse takeovers, the  Financial Times  reported.  Chinese companies use the practice by merging with a U.S.
shell company to avoid the scrutiny of an initial public
offering, the newspaper cited Bolton as saying. He made his
comments yesterday at the first general meeting of the Fidelity
China Special Situations fund, the Financial Times said.  U.S.-listed Chinese companies were among the lowest
performers in Boltonâ€™s portfolio at Fidelity, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
