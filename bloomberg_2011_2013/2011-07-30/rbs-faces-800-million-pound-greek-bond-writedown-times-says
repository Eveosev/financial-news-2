Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  may
be forced to write down the value of its holdings in Greek
government bonds by at least 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion),
 the Times  said, citing calculations by unidentified analysts.  Royal Bank of  Scotland  is the most vulnerable of the
British banks to Greek debt and it has a gross exposure of 1.6
billion pounds after the acquisition of ABN Amro Group NV, the
newspaper said. The bank announces first-half results on Aug. 5.  RBS spokesman Michael Strachan declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
