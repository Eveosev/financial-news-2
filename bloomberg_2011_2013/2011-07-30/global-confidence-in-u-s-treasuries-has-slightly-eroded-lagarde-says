Christine Lagarde , the new chief of
the  International Monetary Fund , said confidence in  U.S.
Treasuries  is “slightly eroded” as politicians continue to
squabble over whether to raise the country’s debt limit.  “There was a positive bias toward the United States of
America, toward Treasury bills,” Lagarde said in an interview
on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” to be broadcast tomorrow.  “The current crisis is probably chipping into that very
positive bias,” she said, according to a transcript provided by
CNN. The “very strong confidence” in Treasury bonds is
“slightly eroded at the moment.”  Congress entered the final weekend before a threatened
default deadlocked over legislation to raise the debt limit as
President  Barack Obama  appealed to party leaders to reach a
compromise. The Treasury Department has said the U.S. will
breach its borrowing limit and run out of options for avoiding
default if the $14.3 trillion ceiling isn’t raised by Aug.  2.  “This level of uncertainty, the trepidation arising from
August the 2nd, is bringing about a lot of instability,”
Lagarde said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
