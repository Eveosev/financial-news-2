The U.S. will be joined by Jamaica
and two teams to be determined in a qualifying group for
soccerâ€™s 2014 World Cup.  The groups were determined by a draw today in  Brazil , which
will host the tournament. The North, Central American and
Caribbean region (CONCACAF) will have three teams automatically
qualify for the World Cup, with a fourth taking part in a
playoff against a team from Oceania.  The U.S., which named Juregen Klinsmann as coach yesterday,
and Jamaica enter in the third qualifying round, with the other
two teams determined by the results of the second qualifying
round. One will come from among Grenada, Guatemala, St.
Vincent/Grenadines or Belize and the other from among Haiti,
Antigua and Barbuda, Curacao and the  U.S. Virgin Islands .  The top two teams in each of the three groups in round
three advance to a six-team fourth round group. The top three
from there qualify for the  World Cup  and the fourth goes into
the playoff.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
