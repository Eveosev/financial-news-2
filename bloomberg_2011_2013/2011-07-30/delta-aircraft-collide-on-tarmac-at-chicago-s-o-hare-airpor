Two  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  planes
collided on the taxiway at  Chicago ’s O’Hare  International
Airport  yesterday, the fourth incident in four months involving
the carrier’s aircraft.  Delta Flight No. 2207, which was scheduled for  Minneapolis ,
and Flight No. 1777, headed to Atlanta, had a “taxiway
incursion,” said Delta spokeswoman Chris Kelly Singley. She
didn’t know the full extent of the damage to the aircraft.  After the incident, which occurred about 7:30 p.m. local
time, the passengers of both planes were removed and rescheduled
on other Delta flights or those of another airlines last night
and this morning, Kelly Singley said. No injuries were reported,
said Karen Pride, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of
Aviation.  “Delta’s No. 1 priority is safety,” Kelly Singley said in
a telephone interview.  Earlier this month, a Delta wide-body plane struck the tail
of a smaller jet from regional partner Atlantic Southeast
Airlines as they prepared for takeoff from  Boston ’s Logan
Airport.  In April, a Bombardier CRJ-700 from Delta’s Comair unit was
clipped by the wing of an Air France Airbus SAS A380 superjumbo
at  New York ’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, spinning
the smaller plane and 66 occupants through 90 degrees.  A month later, the wing of a Delta Boeing 737 struck the
tail of another at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, Delta’s
hometown hub.  “Each of the incidents is being looked at individually,
and by no means do we believe we have a trend,” said Kelly
Singley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
