Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ,  India ’s biggest
maker of  wind turbines , reported first-quarter profit that beat
analyst expectations amid the highest sales yet for the period.  Net income was 600 million rupees ($13.6 million), compared
with a 9.1 billion-rupee loss a year earlier, the Ahmedabad,
India-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. The
median estimate of 6 analysts compiled by Bloomberg was for a
loss of 1.8 billion rupees. Sales rose 80 percent to 43 billion
rupees, Chief Financial Officer  Robin Banerjee  said.  “That’s the highest ever for the first quarter,” Banerjee
said. Offshore wind projects and emerging markets are driving
demand, he said.  The company, controlled by billionaire Tulsi Tanti, has
been boosting orders and raising cash ahead of next year, when
$389 million in convertible bonds mature and principal
repayments restart on 100 billion rupees of loans.  Suzlon booked 580 megawatts of orders during the period,
bringing its order book to 4,739 megawatts with a value of about
293 billion rupees ($6.6 billion), the statement said.  Suzlon has fallen 4.2 percent this year, compared with an
11.3 percent drop in the benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay
Stock Exchange. The stock fell 0.2 percent to 52.4 rupees
yesterday before the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
