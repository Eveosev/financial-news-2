Willie Walsh , chief executive
officer of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, wants
to merge Portuguese state-owned airline TAP SGPS SA with British
Airways and Iberia, the London-based Times reported.  Walsh spoke yesterday about the possibility of including
TAP within the airline holding company, the newspaper said.  IAG is interested in TAP “because it has a very strong
network into  Brazil ,” the Times quoted Walsh as saying. “They
are the No. 1 player between Europe and Brazil.”  Walsh has said he has a list of about 12 carriers he would
like to include within IAG, according to the Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
