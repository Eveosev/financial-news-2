China Vanke Co. (3333) , the nation’s
biggest developer by market value traded on mainland exchanges,
said full-year profit rose 30 percent it sold more small and
medium-sized homes that are less affected by government curbs.  Net income  climbed to 12.55 billion  yuan  ($2 billion) in
the 12 months to Dec. 31 from 9.62 billion yuan a year earlier,
the company said in a statement today. That compares with the
11.95 billion yuan average profit  estimate  based on 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 43 percent to 96.9 billion
yuan, it said.  About 90 percent of Vanke’s projects were homes of less
than 144 square meters (1,550 square feet) in 2012, the company
said. That helped it boost sales even as the government
maintained property curbs, including tighter lending and
restrictions on the number of homes people can own.  “Vanke’s good sales last year definitely helped boost the
earnings as it tapped into the first-home buyers, a segment less
affected by the government’s curbs,” said Zhao Zhenyi, a
Shanghai-based property analyst at Industrial Securities Co.,
before the earnings announcement.  In almost three years since the government began efforts to
rein in property prices, it has raised down-payment and mortgage
requirements, imposed a property tax for the first time in
Shanghai and Chongqing, and enacted home-purchase restrictions
in about 40 cities, while attempting to preserve real demand
from homeowners.  Vanke  shares  rose 4.6 percent to 11.32 yuan at the close of
trading in Shenzhen, before the earnings were announced. They
have gained 12 percent this year. The Shanghai Stock Exchange
Property Index, which tracks 24 developers, advanced 2.8 percent
today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
