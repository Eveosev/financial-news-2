Gold futures dropped, heading for
the longest run of monthly declines in 16 years, as confidence
that the  U.S. economy  is recovering curbed demand for the metal
as an investment hedge.  In January, an index of pending home resales in the U.S.
increased to highest since April 2010, and a measure of durable-
goods orders climbed the most in a year, reports showed today.
Yesterday, gold jumped the most in three months as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  defended monetary stimulus.  “The safe-haven premium is definitely falling,” Vedant Mimani, a portfolio manager at Atyant Capital Management Ltd. in
Miami, said in a telephone interview. “Also, some people are
booking profit after yesterday’s big gain.”  Gold futures for April delivery fell 1.2 percent to settle
at $1,595.70 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New York , the
biggest slide in a week. This month, the price has declined 4
percent, poised for the fifth straight drop and the longest
slump since January 1997.  The index of pending-home resales increased 4.5 percent to
105.9, a report from the National Association of Realtors
showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a
1.9 percent advance. Government data showed that orders for
durable goods excluding transportation equipment climbed 1.9
percent, exceeding all forecasts in another survey.  “Investors have the tendency to buy less of the precious
metal in an environment where growth is stabilizing,” Credit
Suisse Group AG’s private-banking unit said in a report.  Holdings in exchange-traded funds backed by gold fell to a
five-month low of 2,530 metric tons yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. This month, they have dropped 3.1 percent, the
most since April 2008.  Silver futures for May delivery declined 1.1 percent to
$28.985 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest drop in a week.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery fell 1 percent to $1,600.10 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$745.65 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
