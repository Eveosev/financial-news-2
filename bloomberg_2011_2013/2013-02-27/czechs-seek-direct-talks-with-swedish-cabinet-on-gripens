The Czech Cabinet wants to negotiate
with the Swedish government about conditions for prolonging the
lease of Gripen fighter jets, Prime Minister Petr Necas said.  The Czech Republic is seeking better terms than initially
proposed by  Saab AB (SAABB) , the Swedish maker of Gripen combat jets, to
continue leasing the fighter planes.  The country may still decide to hold a tender to secure
protection of its airspace if it fails to agree on long-term
conditions for leasing the Gripen jets, Necas said after the
weekly government meeting in  Prague  today.  The Czech government in 2004 entered a 10-year lease for 12
single-seat and two dual-seat Gripen fighters. The negotiations
are unfolding as Saab seeks to win more orders for the Gripen in
the region, including in Croatia and  Bulgaria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
