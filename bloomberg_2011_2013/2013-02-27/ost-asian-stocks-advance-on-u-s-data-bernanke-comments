Asian  stocks  outside Japan gained
after U.S. housing and  consumer confidence  data beat estimates.
Japanese shares fell as the yen rose ahead of an Italian bond
sale, with yields surging after the nation’s deadlocked election
stoked debt crisis concern.  Techtronic Industries Co., a power-tool maker that counts
the U.S. as its biggest market, advanced 5.8 percent in Hong
Kong.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese camera maker that gets 29 percent
of its sales in Europe, lost 2.7 percent.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) 
added 2 percent in Sydney as gold jumped the most since November
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  defended the
central bank’s asset purchases.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index gained 0.5
percent at 9:42 p.m. in Tokyo, with about 2 stocks rising for
each that fell. The broader MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.2
percent to 133.14.  “You need to watch what happened to Italian bond yields
and how much further they may rise,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-
based chief investment strategist at Russell Investment Group,
which manages about $160 billion. “The markets are copying the
U.S. and Europe right now. There were better data out of the
U.S. and Bernanke’s somewhat reassuring comments.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 9.4 percent from the end
of October through yesterday as Japanese shares rallied on
speculation a new government led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
will press for more stimulus to beat deflation. Asia’s benchmark
 traded  at 14.7 times estimated earnings compared with 13.5 for
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 12.4 for the Stoxx Europe
600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nikkei, Kospi  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 1.3 percent,

rose 0.2 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index added 0.3 percent. China’s
Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.9 percent.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index (TWSE) 
gained 0.2 percent and Singapore’s Straits Times Index rose 0.2
percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.2

yesterday, when reports showed purchases of new homes surged in
January by the most in two decades and consumer confidence
jumped this month.  Companies that do business with the U.S. advanced.

advanced 1.7 percent to A$2.45.  Perseus Mining Ltd. (PRU)  climbed 4.1
percent to A$1.67.  Investors are awaiting Italy’s sale today of as much as 4
billion euros ($5 billion) of a 10-year bond and 2.5 billion
euros of a five-year benchmark note.  This week’s Italian elections produced a hung parliament,
with comedian Beppe Grillo’s anti-austerity movement winning
more than 25 percent of the popular vote, creating the risk of
another election later this year. Italy’s 10-year bond yield

percent growth last year, helped by investments, stronger Asian
currencies and product improvements.  Jupiter Telecommunications Co. jumped 11 percent to 122,900
yen in Osaka, the biggest gainer on the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index. (MXAP)

cable-television broadcaster to 123,000 yen per share from
110,000 yen.  AirAsia Bhd, Asia’s biggest discount carrier, jumped in
Kuala Lumpur after saying it will introduce dividends this year
as profits rose a fourth straight quarter. The stock soared 7.2
percent to 2.83 ringgit, the biggest gain since May.  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. closed unchanged at
HK$137.80 after falling as much as 1.6 percent to HK$136.10. Its
