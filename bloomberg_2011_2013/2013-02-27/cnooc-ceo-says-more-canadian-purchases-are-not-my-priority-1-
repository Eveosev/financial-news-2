Cnooc Ltd. (883)  isn’t looking for more
acquisitions in Canada after completing its $15.1 billion
takeover of  Nexen Inc. (NXY)   More purchases in Canada are “not my priority,” Chief
Executive Officer Li Fanrong told reporters at a press briefing
in Calgary today. Cnooc, the largest offshore oil and natural
gas producer in China, will focus on improving performance and
stabilizing the workforce at Nexen. The acquisition added 20
percent to Cnooc’s production and 30 percent to its reserves, he
said.  Cnooc will keep Nexen’s bonds outstanding, Chief Financial
Officer Zhong Hua said at the briefing. “If necessary, we’re
going to provide the necessary guarantee for the facility,”
Zhong said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
