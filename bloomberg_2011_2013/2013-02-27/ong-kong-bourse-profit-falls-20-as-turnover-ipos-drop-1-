Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. (388) ,
the world’s largest exchange operator by market value, said
full-year profit plunged 20 percent, the first drop in three
years, as turnover and listings fell amid concerns of an
economic slowdown in China and Europe’s debt crisis.  Net income fell to HK$4.08 billion ($526 million), or
HK$3.74 a share, for the year ended Dec. 31, from HK$5.09
billion, or HK$4.70 a share, a year earlier, the company said in
a statement today. That compares with the average HK$4.29
billion  estimate  of 20 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Global equity volumes plunged last year, squeezing
exchanges and brokerages as slowing growth in China and the
U.S., plus Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis, sapped investor
confidence. Hong Kong Exchanges bought the London Metal Exchange
for $2.2 billion in December as Chief Executive Charles Li seeks
to transform the bourse into a global operator to compete with
other exchanges in the region.  “Investors are now watching closely the LME development to
see if it will have a positive impact on the stock exchange,”
said  Ben Kwong , chief operating officer at brokerage KGI Asia
Ltd. in Hong Kong. The company’s shares are likely to trade
between HK$130 and HK$150 “until there’s a fresh catalyst for
earnings. It all depends on market activities in the coming
months.”  Hong Kong Exchanges rose 0.8 percent to HK$138.90 at the
midday trading break today, compared with a 0.5 percent gain by
the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)  The stock rose 4.5 percent this
year through yesterday, and are traded at about 29.5 times
estimated earnings, compared with 25.2 times for the  Singapore
Exchange Ltd. (SGX)  and 18.1 times for the Australian counterpart ASX
Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
