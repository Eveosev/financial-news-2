Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank is looking into whether asset-
price bubbles may be forming in some financial markets as a
result of a prolonged period of low interest rates.  The potential for bubbles is a “cost to these policies,
and one that we take very seriously,” he said in  Washington 
today in response to questions from members of the House
Financial Services Committee.  The Fed chairman said the central bank is looking at the
conditions behind asset markets, such as whether prices are
rising in the context of higher leverage or whether these assets
are owned by institutions that could jeopardize the broader
economy if prices fall.  The Fed has held the benchmark lending  rate  near zero since
December 2008, encouraging investors to seek higher yields in
riskier securities. The central bank is also keeping rates low
on mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasury debt,
buying $85 billion a month of the securities in a third round of
quantitative easing.  “We are examining this with a great deal of care,”
Bernanke said. “ Interest rates  are low for a good reason.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
