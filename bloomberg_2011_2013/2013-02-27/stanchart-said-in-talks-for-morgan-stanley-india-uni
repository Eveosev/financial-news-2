Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K bank
that earns most of its profit in Asia, is in talks to buy  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ’s Indian wealth management unit, two people familiar
with the discussions said.  Standard Chartered, which re-entered the private banking
business in 2006, is planning to expand in India, one of the
people said, asking not to be identified as the information is
private.  Morgan Stanley is narrowing its focus on  investment banking 
and asset management in the South Asian nation. Even after it
won approval for commercial banking operations in India last
year, the New York-based bank won’t be starting that business in
the country, one person said. The bank has more than 400
employees in India.  India is  Standard Chartered ’s third  largest  market after
Hong Kong and Singapore, company  presentations  show. In the six
months through June, the bank generated $311 million in profit
before tax, or about 8 percent of its total worldwide, from the
country.  Standard Chartered and Morgan Stanley declined to comment
on the talks in e-mailed statements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
