Chile’s peso appreciated after  Italy 
reached its target in a bond sale and U.S. data showed company
spending and home sales rose faster than forecast, boosting
appetite for riskier assets such as emerging-market currencies
and stocks.  The peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 473.03 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close in Santiago. The peso has traded between 472 and
475 per dollar since Feb. 20.  Italy sold 6.5 billion euros ($8.5 billion) of five- and
10-year bonds in its first auction since inconclusive election
results. An index of U.S. pending home sales increased more than
forecast and durable goods orders excluding transportation gear
climbed the most in a year in January, helping boost U.S.
stocks.  “The dollar’s weaker today because we are stabilizing
after the sell-off,” said Katia Diaz, an economist at 4Cast
Inc. in  New York . “The peso’s ranges are getting tighter as the
global market stabilizes, but given the falling copper price and
the uncertainty from the Italian elections we’ll continue to
trade within a range until there’s a bigger trigger.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
