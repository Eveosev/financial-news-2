United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB) , Southeast
Asia’s third-largest lender by assets, said profit rose for the
fourth straight quarter, driven by operations such as  capital
markets  and  wealth management .  Fourth-quarter net income rose 25 percent to S$696 million
($561 million) from S$558 million a year earlier, the bank said
in a statement to the Singapore stock exchange today. That beat
the S$614 million average of nine analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  UOB joins DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. in boosting profit amid four years of shrinking
loan profitability and a 2012 economic expansion that was
Singapore’s slowest in three years. Cost control and income from
businesses such as credit cards and fund management have helped
compensate for the region’s thinnest lending margins.  “We expect the momentum in fees and commissions to
continue into 2013, specifically in areas such as wealth
management,” Ken Ang, a Singapore-based analyst at Phillip
Securities Pte, said before the earnings were announced. “The
equities outlook for 2013 is also benign, which may add to some
positive surprises on trading income.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
