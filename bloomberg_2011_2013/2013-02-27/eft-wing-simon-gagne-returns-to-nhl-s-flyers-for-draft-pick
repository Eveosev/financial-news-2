the  Philadelphia Flyers  from the  Los Angeles Kings  in exchange
for a draft pick, Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren said.  Gagne, 32, was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning from the
Flyers in 2010. He rejoined the team yesterday in exchange for a

of areas,” Holmgren said in a statement released by the team.  Gagne had 40 points in 63 games during the 2010-11 season
with the Lightning. He signed as a free agent with the Kings
before the 2011-2012 season. He had no goals and five assists in
11 games with  Los Angeles  this season.  In 10 seasons with the Flyers, Gagne scored 259 goals and
had 265 assists in 664 regular-season games. He led the team in
goals in 2001-02, 2005-06 and 2006-07.  To contact the reporter on this story:
