TMX Group Ltd. (X)  and  London Stock
Exchange (LSE)  Group Plc plan to combine existing data pools to create
indexes that track C$1 trillion ($975 billion) in bonds.  The new provider will be called FTSE TMX Debt Capital
Markets and will be the third-biggest provider of indexes to the
exchange traded fund industry, Toronto-based TMX Group and
London Stock Exchange’s FTSE Group said in a  statement  today.
The London-based firm will own 75 percent of the venture and
will pay TMX Group, owner of the remaining stake, C$112.2
million ($109.4 million) in cash.  “This transaction provides TMX Datalinx with a new global
presence in the fixed income index business,” Eric Sinclair,
head of information services at TMX Group said in the statement.
TMX Group owns PC-Bond, which publishes the Dex Universe Bond
Index. “By partnering with FTSE, we will grow the business
globally, while continuing to serve our existing Canadian
clients.”  The data provider, to be based in  London  and Toronto,
employs nine people and had combined pro forma revenues of
C$21.3 million in 2012, according to the statement.  The deal, which the companies expect to close in the second
quarter, will be “slightly dilutive” to TMX Group’s earnings
per share this year, the companies said. FTSE will open an
office in Toronto, the companies said, without giving a
timeframe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
