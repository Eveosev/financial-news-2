Russian winter-grain losses may fall
to as low as 8 percent because of warm weather in southern
regions, said Roman Vilfand, director of the Federal
Hydrometeorological Center.  The losses are expected to be 8 percent to 9.5 percent of
the sown area, he said by phone in Moscow today. That would be
on about 1.2 million hectares (3 million acres) to 1.5 million
hectares of land, said Anna Strashnaya, head of the center’s
agrometeorological forecasts department.  The losses compare with a December estimate of 9.5 percent.
The average estimated winter kill range is about 8.75 percent of
the total sown area, Strashnaya said by phone in Moscow.  Winter frosts in parts of the Volga, Central, and Southern
federal districts caused the losses, Strashnaya said. The three
areas account for 71 percent of the 50.5 million metric tons
harvested in the season which started July 1, according to the
state statistics data.  “Winter grains’ loss is better than on average in the past
five years,” Gennady Yeliseyev, deputy head of the weather
center, said by phone. “The situation improved a little bit
because of high temperatures of 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees
Fahrenheit) to 17 degrees Celsius in the south, which helped
plants develop.” Several southern farms started spring sowing
in February because of favorable weather, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
