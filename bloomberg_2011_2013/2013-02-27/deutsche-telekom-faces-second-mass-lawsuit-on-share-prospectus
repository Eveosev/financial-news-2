Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  is facing a
second mass shareholder damage case over allegations the company
misled investors when it sold shares.  About 150 investors are suing over Deutsche Telekom’s
second share sale, done in 1999, arguing the company made false
statements in its prospectus, including wrong information about
the value of its real estate, Ingo Noehre, a spokesman for the
Frankfurt Higher Regional Court said in an e-mailed statement.
The tribunal held a hearing in the case today and judges
scheduled a ruling for May 22.  Last year, Deutsche Telekom won dismissal of a case
bundling suits by more than 16,000 shareholders over the
prospectus issued for a 13 billion-euro ($17 billion) share sale
in 2000. The shareholders, who mostly held small stakes, were
seeking about 80 million euros in compensation and argued the
sales prospectus contained dozens of mistakes. That case is now
pending on appeal in  Germany ’s top civil court.  Deutsche Telekom spokesman Nico Goericke rejected the
allegation, adding that the prospectus was complete and correct.
The same judges hearing the new case have ruled in favor of
Deutsche Telekom in the earlier case, where the arguments were
for the most part identical, he said in an e-mailed statement.  Today’s case is: OLG Frankfurt am Main, 23 Kap 2/06.  To contact the reporter on this story:
