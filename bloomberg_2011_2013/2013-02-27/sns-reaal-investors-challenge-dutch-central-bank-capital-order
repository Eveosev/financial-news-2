Four investors in SNS Reaal NV
challenged a Dutch central bank decision ordering the lender to
boost its capital, saying that wrongfully triggered the
government’s decision to seize their securities.  The central bank  ordered  SNS Reaal on Jan. 27 to close a
capital shortfall of at least 1.84 billion euros ($2.4 billion)
caused by losses on real-estate loans. On Feb. 1, the  Finance
Ministry  announced that the bank would be nationalized after it
missed the Jan. 31 deadline.  The central bank misinterpreted banking supervision law,
 Jeroen Wendelgelst , a lawyer for the investors, wrote in a
complaint dated Feb. 26 seeking restitution. The order was
unjustified because the law allows the central bank to raise the
minimum-capital requirement, not to demand an increase in
capital, he wrote. Wendelgelst declined to identify his clients
when contacted by  Bloomberg News .  The Amsterdam-based central bank confirmed receipt of the
complaint. “We will look into it,” bank spokesman Tobias
Oudejans said by telephone.  The Netherlands’ top administrative court upheld the
government’s seizure of SNS Reaal’s shares and subordinated
loans because without such action the bank would probably have
gone bankrupt, the Council of State said on Feb. 25.  Under Dutch law, complaints regarding the central bank must
be made first to the bank itself. The central bank’s response
can be appealed in administrative court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
