Italy’s 10-year bonds rose, pushing
yields down from a three-month high, as the nation prepared for
its first bond auction since inconclusive election results
renewed concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will deepen.  Italian 10-year securities pared a monthly decline as
nation prepared to sell as much as 4 billion euros ($5.23
billion) of new 10-year bonds and 2.5 billion euros of five-year
notes. Spanish bonds also gained before a report that analysts
said will show euro-area  economic confidence  increased to the
highest level in eight months in February.  Germany ’s 10-year
yields reached an eight-week low.  “The market is going to focus on the Italian auctions
after the election,” said Niels From, chief analyst at Nordea
Bank AB in Copenhagen. “There is a lot of uncertainty and we
may be facing another election. There’s a risk of yields moving
higher. The longer it takes to create political certainty in
 Italy , the higher the risk will be.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.86 percent at 9:10 a.m. London time,
after rising to 4.96 percent, the  highest level  since Nov. 15.
The 5.5 percent bond due November 2022 gained 0.265, or 2.65
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 105.315.  The rate jumped as much as 44 basis points yesterday, the
biggest increase since Dec. 19, 2011, and has climbed 55 basis-
point this month.  Election Stalemate  Italian 10-year bonds tumbled yesterday as results showed
pre-election favorite Pier Luigi Bersani won the lower house by
less than a half a percentage point, while  Silvio Berlusconi ,
the former premier fighting a tax-fraud conviction, gained a
blocking minority in the Senate.  The Rome-based Treasury last auctioned 10-year bonds on
Jan. 30 at an average yield of 4.17 percent. The same day, it
sold securities maturing in November 2017 at 2.94 percent.  Spain ’s 10-year yield dropped three basis points to 5.33
percent after climbing 20 basis points yesterday.  An index of economic confidence in the currency bloc rose
to 89.9 from 89.2 in January, according to the median forecast
of 29 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Germany’s 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.45
percent after reaching 1.44 percent, the least since Jan. 3.  German  government bonds  handed investors a loss of 0.5
