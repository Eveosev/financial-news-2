Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the biggest U.S.
chemical maker by sales, said the spread of weeds resistant to
the glyphosate herbicide made by  Monsanto Co. (MON)  is accelerating,
creating opportunites for products it plans to begin introducing
this year.  About 65 million acres of U.S. cropland harbored weeds last
year that aren’t killed by glyphosate, the world’s best-selling
herbicide, Antonio Galindez, president of Dow AgroSciences, said
today in a webcast from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Agriculture Conference in Miami. Infested land rose 25 percent
in 2011 and 51 percent last year, he said.  Glyophosate is the active ingredient in Roundup, Monsanto’s
brand for the weed killer.  Dow expects to earn $1.5 billion selling a its 2,4-D
herbicide and crops engineered to tolerate it, Galindez said,
repeating earlier forecasts.  Dow should receive U.S. approval to sell a reformulated
version of 2,4-D in months, he said. Corn that tolerates 2,4-D
should be approved later this year, with soy approval expected
in 2015 and cotton in 2016, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
