(Corrects second graph to say two-week low.)  Swiss stocks were little changed,
after the benchmark Swiss Market Index yesterday dropped the
most in 10 months, as investors awaited the outcome of Italy’s
sale of long-term debt.  Swiss Life Holding AG jumped the most since November after
reporting a second-half loss that was narrower than analysts had
projected.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s largest cement-maker,
dropped to a two-week low.  The SMI slipped less than 0.1 percent to 7,447.23 at 10:16
a.m. in Zurich. The benchmark measure has still rallied 9.1
percent this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise
 federal budget  and the Swiss franc depreciated against the euro.
The broader Swiss Performance Index also fell less than 0.1
percent today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
