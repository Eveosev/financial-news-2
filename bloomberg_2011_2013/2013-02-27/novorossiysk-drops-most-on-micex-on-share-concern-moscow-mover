OAO Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port
fell the most on Russia’s benchmark stock gauge after the
government said it may sell a 20 percent stake in the country’s
largest Black Sea harbor through an additional share placement.  Novorossiysk dropped 3.7 percent to 3.45 rubles by 2:19
p.m. in Moscow, poised for the lowest close since Feb. 5. The
stock declined 2.6 percent in London.  The government hasn’t yet made a final decision on how to
sell its 20 percent stake in Novorossiysk, which it may offer in
an additional share placement or to a strategic investor, Olga Dergunova, the head of Federal Property Management Agency, said
in Moscow today. The sale, which is planned for this year, is
unlikely to happen in the “spring window,” Dergunova said.
Russia is interested in finding a strategic investor for the
Novorossiysk shares, Economy Minister Andrei Belousov said Feb.
7 at a government meeting.  “The fact that the government is once again considering an
additional share placement instead of a sale to a strategic
investor, is negative for sentiment because it creates a share
overhang risk,” Vladimir Dorogov, an analyst at Alfa Bank, said
by phone from Moscow. “Also, investors are concerned that there
may be a delay in the privatization.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
