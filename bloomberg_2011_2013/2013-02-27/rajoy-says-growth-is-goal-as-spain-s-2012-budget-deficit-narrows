Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
said his top priority is to return the euro region’s fourth-
largest economy to  growth  after the budget  deficit  narrowed to
6.7 percent of output in 2012.  “The most important of  Spain ’s goals are economic growth
and creating jobs,” Rajoy told lawmakers in Madrid today.
Current economic policy including measures announced last week
to spur financing for small businesses and reduce youth
unemployment will enable the government to achieve them, he
said.  The Bank of Spain said today the recession is extending
into the first quarter after worsening in the final three months
of 2012. Spain’s national statistics institute is due to release
a breakdown of fourth-quarter gross domestic product tomorrow as
the  International Monetary Fund  forecasts a deeper contraction
this year.  Spain will notify the European Commission that its
overspending narrowed to 6.7 percent of GDP last year, Rajoy
said. Including European aid to recapitalize banks, the figure
is 10.2 percent of GDP, the Commission estimated last week.  “There is no doubt this increases confidence in Spain,”
Rajoy said. “What happened yesterday on the markets had nothing
to do with Spain.”  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  dropped five
basis points after Rajoy spoke to 5.32 percent at 9:44 a.m.
before paring the decline. It was at 5.36 percent at 11:05 a.m.
in Madrid, up 19 basis points from Feb. 25, before the results
of the Italian elections were known.  To contact the reporter on this story:
