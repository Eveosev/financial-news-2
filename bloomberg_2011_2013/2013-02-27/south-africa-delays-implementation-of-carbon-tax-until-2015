South Africa delayed introducing a
carbon tax until 2015 after objections from metals companies
such as  ArcelorMittal (MT)  South Africa Ltd. and  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)   The tax of 120 rand ($14) a metric ton of carbon on 40
percent of a company’s emissions will rise 10 percent a year
until 2020, the National Treasury said today in its Budget
Review in Cape Town. The government is also considering
scrapping an electricity levy over the same period, it said.  The Treasury previously said it would impose the carbon
tax, initially proposed in December 2010, from April 1.  “By pricing the external costs associated with carbon-
dioxide emissions, incentives will be created to change behavior
and encourage energy-efficiency measures,” the Treasury said.  South Africa will probably raise 8 billion to 30 billion
rand a year from the proposed tax, Cecil Morden, chief director
of tax policy, said in an interview. The Treasury will release
an updated policy paper for comment by the end of next month.  The country said in 2009 it would try to cut emissions 34
percent by 2020 and 42 percent by 2025 on condition developed
countries offer money and technical assistance. Carbon released
may peak at 614 million tons by 2025 and a maximum 428 million
tons by 2050, according to government estimates.  While the Treasury says some revenue from the tax will fund
incentives to spur energy efficiency, mining and manufacturing
companies believe it’s unaffordable and will deter investment.  “We welcome the delay of the carbon tax on the basis that
it would have added to the already significant burden of input-
cost rises the industry is facing,” Sven Lunsche, a spokesman
for Gold Fields in Johannesburg, said by e-mail. “We question
whether revenue from carbon taxes will be ring-fenced to fund
nationwide carbon adaptation and mitigation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
