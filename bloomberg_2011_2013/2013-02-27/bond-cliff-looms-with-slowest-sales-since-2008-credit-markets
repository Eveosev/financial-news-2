Company bond  sales  worldwide are on
pace for the slowest February since 2008 as the prospect of
rising interest rates in the U.S. and persistent recession in
 Europe  quashes the busiest start to a year on record.  “Economic conditions don’t warrant necessarily any
significant increases in funding,” Kevin Flanagan, chief fixed-
income strategist at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Purchase,
New York, said in a telephone interview. “In terms of balance
sheet and liquidity, cash on hand and refunding, the lion’s
share of all that balance sheet repair work has been done.”  Ashland Inc. (ASH) , the biggest producer of specialty paper-
making chemicals, and Newbury, England-based Vodafone Group Plc
are leading sales of at least $207.1 billion, down 50 percent
from  $415.6 billion  in February 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Offerings have fallen from an unprecedented $425
billion in January.  Debt maturing in three years accounted for 23.2 percent of
U.S. sales this month, the biggest share since March 2011, amid
concern borrowing costs may rise as the Federal Reserve signals
it may wean the economy off stimulus measures. In Europe,
companies are avoiding the bond market as they accumulate more
than three times the cash they held a decade ago, with the
European Commission forecasting the euro area will shrink for a
second year.  Accumulating Cash  Yields on global corporate bonds from the riskiest to the
most creditworthy have risen to 3.3 percent as of Feb. 25 from
an all-time low of 3.24 percent on Dec. 28, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate & High Yield
index. The extra yield investors demand to own the debt rather
than government debentures has narrowed 8 basis points during
the same period to 211 basis points.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting
corporate debt from default in the U.S. fell, with the Markit
CDX North American Investment Grade Index, which investors use
to hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness,
decreasing 1 basis point to a mid-price of 88.4 basis points as
of 10:54 a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The measure has declined from 90.2 basis points on
Feb. 25, the highest level in three weeks.  Swap Spreads  The index typically falls as investor confidence improves
and rises as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  In  London , the  Markit iTraxx Europe Index  a credit-default
swaps benchmark of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings
fell 3.3 to 119.1.  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt market stress, rose 0.93 basis point to 15.75 basis points
as of 10:57 a.m. in New York. The gauge widens when investors
seek the perceived safety of government securities and narrows
when they favor assets such as company debentures.  Bonds of New York-based  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  are the
most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by
dealers today, accounting for 3.1 percent of the volume of
dealer trades of $1 million or more, at 11 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  February Sales  February’s corporate bond sales have been the slowest since
$170.3 billion in the similar period in 2008, Bloomberg data
show. Issuance is 30 percent below the $297.9 billion February
average from the past five years.  “It’s hard to top what happened last February,” Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
in Philadelphia, said in a telephone interview. “There’s still
demand, but it’s a little bit spottier than last year.”  Ashland raised $2.3 billion with senior unsecured notes to
pay back a portion of its secured loans. The chemicals maker’s
sale included $600 million of 3 percent debt due in 2016 that
yields 260 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
$650 million of 4.75 percent bonds maturing in 2022 with a 290
basis-point spread and $700 million of five-year bonds with a
3.875 percent coupon that pay 304 more than benchmarks,
Bloomberg data show.  Three-Year Debt  Borrowers in the U.S. issued $20.3 billion of debt maturing
in about three years this month, the biggest share since March
2011, when they made up $36.6 billion or 23.5 percent of sales,
Bloomberg data show. The share of 30-year debt being sold fell
to 5.5 percent from 7.7 percent last month.  “We’ve been on a floater, non-standard tenor tear,”
Timothy Cox, executive director of debt capital markets at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc., said in a telephone interview.
“You’ve had a whole gamut of spreads and products.”  Benchmark 10-year  Treasury yields  closed above the 2
percent mark this month for the first time since April, reaching
 2.01 percent  on Feb. 1, before falling to 1.88 percent
yesterday, Bloomberg data show. Rates have risen from an all-
time low of 1.39 percent on July 24.  Several Fed officials “emphasized that the committee
should be prepared to vary the pace of asset purchases, either
in response to changes in the economic outlook or as its
evaluation of the efficacy and costs of such purchases
evolved,” according to the minutes of the Federal Open Market
Committee’s Jan. 29-30 meeting released on Feb. 20.  Fed Divisions  The minutes showed policy makers were divided about the
strategy behind Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s program of buying
bonds until there is “substantial” improvement in a U.S. labor
market burdened with 7.9 percent unemployment, with some saying
an earlier end to purchases might be needed, and others warning
against a premature withdrawal of stimulus.  Bernanke defended the central bank’s unprecedented asset
purchases yesterday, saying they are supporting the expansion
with little risk of inflation or asset-price bubbles.  Dollar-denominated sales have declined to $87.6 billion
this month from  $148.3 billion  in February 2012, Bloomberg data
show. As investor sensitivity to interest rates mounts, inflows
to bank loan funds reached a record $1.4 billion in the week
ended Feb. 13, helping bring the total through the year to $6.9
billion, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc research.  ‘Cautious’ Institutions  “Institutional investors are starting to get very
nervous,” Mark Pibl, head of credit strategy at Cortview
Capital Securities LLC, said in a telephone interview, referring
to the rising rates. “I wouldn’t say institutional money is
becoming defensive, I would say they are more cautious.”  The euro area will shrink for two straight years for the
first time since the common currency was introduced, the
European Commission predicted on Feb. 22, scrapping an earlier
growth forecast.  Europe’s iTraxx default-swaps index has climbed 17 basis
points since Jan. 21 from 102.1, the least since May 2011.  Cash holdings at the 265 European companies in the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, excluding banks and insurers, have reported
2012 results totaled $475 billion at the end of last year,
Bloomberg data show. That compares with $136 billion in 2002 and
is 14 percent more than in 2011. Siemens AG,  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) 
and  Total SA (FP)  are among nine companies that each held more than
$10 billion.  Vodafone Group, the world’s second-largest mobile-phone
company, raised $6 billion on Feb. 11 in five parts, Bloomberg
data show. The offering from the company included $1.6 billion
of 2.95 percent, 10-year securities at a spread of 105 basis
points.  “It’s healthy that we have some pullback,” Mizuho’s Cox
said. “Nothing goes straight up forever.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
