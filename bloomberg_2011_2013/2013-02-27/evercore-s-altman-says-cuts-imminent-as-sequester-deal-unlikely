Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  Chairman
 Roger Altman  said the Obama Administration and Congress aren’t
likely to reach agreement on avoiding automatic spending cuts
scheduled to go into effect March 1.  “There’s not going to be a deal,” Altman, a former U.S.
deputy treasury secretary, said today in an interview with Betty
Liu on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop.” “What’s likely
here is that the sequester will take effect, but not long
enough to have a big impact on the economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
