Brazil’s soybean growers association
plans to sue  Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s biggest seed company, for
charging royalty payments two years after a patent expired, the
head of the association known as Aprosoja said.  “We want Monsanto to give back to producers 1.2 billion
reais ($606.7 million) of royalties charged incorrectly,”
Glauber Silveira told reporters in Brasilia. Monsanto, based in
St. Louis, also faces lawsuits from producers in the Brazilian
states of  Rio Grande  do Sul and Mato Grosso.  Brazil’s Superior Court denied an appeal from Monsanto last
week to extend the patent that expired in 2010 for a genetically
modified soybean seed called RR1. The company yesterday said
that it would suspend RR1 royalties until the case is resolved.
Monsanto appealed and is seeking to have the case heard by
Brazil’s  Supreme Court .  “We believe we are in our right to charge the royalties,”
Marcio Santos, strategy and products director at Monsanto, said
in an interview in Brasilia today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
