Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the most
popular social-networking service, is expanding a service that
lets marketers tailor ads based on customer lists.  Facebook said in a blog posting that it’s expanding its
Custom Audiences service to third parties.  “An auto dealer may want to customize an offer to people
who are likely to be in the market for a new car,” the company
said. “To do this many businesses work with third party
companies to better understand who might be in the market for a
new car.”  Facebook, which has more than 1 billion users, is looking
for new ways to improve revenue growth.  -- Editor: Tom Giles  To contact the reporter on this story:
