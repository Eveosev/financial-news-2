Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JMT) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest retailer, fell the most since in seven months after
declining consumption at home and a slowdown in  Poland  led to
earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  The stock  declined  as much as 7.1 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since July 25. The shares were down 5.5 percent at
15.22 euros as of 10:30 a.m.  Same-store sales at Jeronimo Martin’s Pingo Doce chain in
Portugal fell 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter after rising 0.1
percent in the first nine months of last year, the Lisbon-based
company said in a  statement  today. Net income in 2012 rose 5.9
percent to 360.4 million euros, missing the 387.5 million-euro
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The news today is earnings which were lower than
expected,” Andrew Gwynn, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said
in a note. “We would expect negative revisions to consensus
today.”  Jeronimo Martins  said it expects “double-digit” sales
growth this year at constant exchange rates as it opens 30 to 40
stores in  Colombia , its third market after Portugal and Poland.  “In the context of declining consumption in Portugal and
the slowdown in economic growth in Poland, the group delivered
its ambition of growing ahead of the market,” Jeronimo Martins
said.  The company will propose a gross dividend of 29.5 euro-
cents a share after paying an extraordinary dividend of 23.9
cents a share in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
