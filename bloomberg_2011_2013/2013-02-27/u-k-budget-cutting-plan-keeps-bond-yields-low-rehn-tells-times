The U.K. needs to continue its
budget-cutting strategy to keep government borrowing costs low,
European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said.  The U.K.’s public debt is approaching levels that are
“normally considered to have a drag on growth for quite some
time,” Rehn said in an interview with the  Times newspaper 
published today.  “I don’t believe that fiscal-consolidation plans should be
reversed, as growth is now set to start to pick up,” Rehn was
quoted as saying by the Times. “It is still decisive in
affording favorable financing conditions into the U.K. and
therefore it should be maintained.”  Rehn also said France is a “borderline” case in terms of
its efforts to make structural changes to its economy, according
to the newspaper. The Times cited Rehn as saying that the EU’s
economic governance rules are not “stupid” and won’t be too
severe.  “The rules of the pact are designed to avoid too drastic
consolidation in case there is a credible medium-term strategy
of fiscal sustainability in place,” Rehn told the newspaper.
“That is what we have been calling for from  France .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
