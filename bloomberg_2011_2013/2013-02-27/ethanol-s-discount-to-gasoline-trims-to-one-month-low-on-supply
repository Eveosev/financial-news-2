Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed to the smallest level in more than a month as plant
shutdowns drained stockpiles of the fuel.  The spread contracted 11.41 cents to 47.15 cents a gallon
the least difference since Jan. 23 and the biggest one-day fall
since Oct. 1. Stockpiles have fallen four consecutive weeks, the
longest streak of declines since October 2010, to the lowest
level in 12 weeks, an Energy Information Administration report
showed today.  “It’s harder and harder to get stuff bought,” said Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida .
“There’s less ethanol available.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery slid 1.1 cent, or 0.5
percent, to $2.385 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have advanced 8.9 percent this year.  Gasoline for March delivery plunged 12.51 cents, or 4.2
percent, to $2.8565 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol.  Ethanol futures traded higher before the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, released the report showing
production gained a fourth week, the longest string of advances
since Aug. 17.  Output was 812,000 barrels a day, down 16 percent from the
record in December 2011. On an annualized basis of 12.5 billion
gallons, that’s short of the 13.8 billion refiners are mandated
to use under a 2007 law.  Drought’s Effect  Drought in the corn-rich U.S. Midwest devastated yields and
raised the cost of turning the grain into the biofuel. At least
19 ethanol plants have been idled since June, according to the
 Renewable Fuels Association  in  Washington .  Corn for March delivery rose 4.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$7.095 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 20 cents,
compared with minus 17 cents yesterday and minus 35 cents on
Dec. 31. The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production,
which can be fed to livestock.  Imports of the fuel have increased as output has dropped,
EIA data show. Ethanol  imports  last week rose 52 percent to
32,000 barrels a day, the highest level in five weeks.  Spot Prices  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  fetched $2.43 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 88 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Feb. 22, down from 90
percent the previous week, the EIA reported.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 1.5 cent to $2.52 a
gallon in  New York ; was unchanged at $2.38 in Chicago; added 0.5
cent to $2.45 on the  Gulf Coast ; and climbed 0.5 cent to $2.58 a
gallon on the West Coast, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf was unchanged
at 13 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor widened
to 14 cents from 12.5.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, for
corn-based ethanol reached a record 53 cents today, according to
Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York. They were 45.5 cents
yesterday.  RINs are a mechanism to help the Environmental Protection
Agency rack compliance with government biofuel use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
