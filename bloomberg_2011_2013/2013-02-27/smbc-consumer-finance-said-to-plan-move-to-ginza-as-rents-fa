Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. (8316) ’s consumer lending unit plans to move its Tokyo office to
the Ginza shopping district to take advantage of lower rents and
better facilities, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  SMBC Consumer Finance Co. aims to move its headquarters
into  Shochiku Co. (9601) ’s new kabuki theater building later this year,
one of the people said, asking not to be named before a final
agreement is reached.  The consumer lender, which was created last year after
 Japan ’s second-largest bank by market value made Promise Co. a
wholly owned unit, is located in the city’s Otemachi financial
district. Rents in central Tokyo fell to a  record low  in
January, according to Miki Shoji Co., an office brokerage firm.  “Nothing has been decided” about a relocation, said
Takahiko Ishibashi, a spokesman at SMBC Consumer Finance in
 Tokyo . Taisuke Agata, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Shochiku,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
