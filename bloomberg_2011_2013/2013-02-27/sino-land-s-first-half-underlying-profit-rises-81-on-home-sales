Sino Land Co. (83) , the developer that
derives almost all its earnings from Hong Kong, said fiscal
first-half underlying profit rose 81 percent after booking more
apartment sales as the city’s home prices rose to a record.  Profit excluding revaluation gains increased to HK$4.49
billion ($579 million) for the six months ended Dec. 31 from
HK$2.49 billion a year earlier, the company said in a statement
to Hong Kong’s stock exchange today. That compares with the
HK$3.9 billion median estimates of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Sino Land, controlled by the family of billionaire Robert
Ng, last year more than tripled the number of homes it sold in
Hong Kong, where  home prices  have doubled in the past four
years, according to figures compiled by Centaline Property
Agency Ltd. Builders in the city are accelerating home sales as
the government pledged to increase land supply to make housing
more affordable for the general public.  “Sino is clearly a beneficiary of rising land supply,”
CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets analysts Susanna Leung and Nicole Wong
wrote in a report yesterday. The developer has expanded its land
reserve by 26 percent since July, according to the analysts.  The  developer , the smallest among the nine-member Hang Seng
Property Index, rose 2.9 percent to HK$13.64 at the close of
trading in Hong Kong today, before earnings were announced. The
stock has fallen 1.2 percent in the past 12 months, compared
with a 15 percent gain in the index.  Sino Land said revenue from rental properties gained 9.9
percent from a year ago to HK$1.4 billion, while revenue from
home sales more than doubled to HK$3.9 billion.  The builder sold about 1,900 homes for revenue of more than
HK$21 billion in 2012, according to Centaline.  Hong Kong home prices have doubled since early 2009 and
have surpassed their 1997 peak earlier last year, according to
Centaline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
