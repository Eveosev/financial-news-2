Gasoline futures declined the most
in 14 months after a government report showed rising East Coast
inventories as refineries restored production following
maintenance.  The discount of March to April contracts widened as the
U.S. prepared to switch from winter- to summer-grade fuel.
Gasoline  supplies  on the East Coast grew by 0.4 percent to 59.8
million barrels in the week ended Feb. 22, the highest level
since March 16, an Energy Information Administration report
today showed. Refinery  production  rose to 85.1 percent of U.S.
capacity from 82.9 percent a week earlier.  “Refinery utilization increased,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “Refineries
are starting to exit from peak maintenance season and will be
producing more gasoline as we go forward.”  March-delivery gasoline dropped 12.51 cents, or 4.2
percent, to settle at $2.8565 a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the biggest one-day percentage drop since
Dec. 14, 2011. Trading was 42 percent above the 100-day average
at 4:02 p.m. Prices are down 5.6 percent this month.  The March contract expires tomorrow. The more actively
traded April-delivery futures fell 9.25 cents to $3.1063 a
gallon. Prices are higher than March futures because the summer
blend of fuel represented by the April contract is costlier to
produce. The discount of March to April, known as a  contango ,
was 24.98 cents a gallon, widening from 13.69 cents at the end
of December.  “There appears to be ample winter-grade around; perhaps
people are selling to get rid of inventory as we head toward
expiration,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at
Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.  Refinery Shuts  Hess Corp. (HES)  shut its 70,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Port
Reading, New Jersey, yesterday as the company exits the refining
business, a spokesman for the New York City-based company said
by e-mail today.  The plant, which opened in 1958, will now operate as a
terminal. The refinery didn’t process crude. It had a fluid
catalytic cracker that converted heavy gasoil into lighter
transportation fuels like gasoline and diesel.  Colonial Pipeline Co. “essentially completed” an
expansion of Line 3, which carries mixed oil products to Linden,
New Jersey, from Greensboro, North Carolina, said Steve Baker,
an Alpharetta, Georgia-based spokesman for the company.  Line Capacity  The pipeline has added 60,000 barrels a day to bring its
capacity to 885,000. One new pump station remains offline as the
company waits to receive a permit to operate it, Baker said.
When turned on, it will add a small amount of capacity to the
line.  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.4 cent to
$3.786 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website. It was the
highest price since Oct. 14.  Heating oil for March delivery fell 4.38 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.9879 a gallon on the Nymex on trading 31 percent
above the 100-day average. Prices have slipped 4.5 percent this
month. The April contract fell 4.22 cents to $2.9846 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
