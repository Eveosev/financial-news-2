Egypt  has 3 million metric tons of
domestic and imported wheat in stockpiles, enough to meet
consumption for 123 days, the cabinet said.  Inventories of domestic and imported sugar are about
290,000 tons, sufficient to satisfy 71 days of local demand, the
cabinet said today in an e-mailed statement. The government has
142,000 tons of domestic and imported food oil on hand, enough
to meet consumption through the middle of May, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
