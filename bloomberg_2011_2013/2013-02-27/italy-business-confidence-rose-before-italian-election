Italian business confidence rose
this month before the Italian election that produced a hung
parliament and sent bond yields soaring.  The manufacturing-sentiment index rose to 88.5 in February
from a revised 88.3 the previous month, Rome-based national
statistics institute Istat said today. Economists had predicted
a reading of 88.4, according to the median of 14 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. The index is based on a poll of about
4,000 businesses and was carried out in the first half of
February.  Italy’s vote on Feb. 24-25 saw the leading bloc headed by
Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani failing to win a
majority in both houses of Parliament, making it difficult to
form a government able to deal with the slump in the euro
region’s third-biggest economy. Italy will contract again this
year and unemployment will continue to rise in 2014 to reach 12
percent, European Commission forecasts released on Feb. 2 show.
Italy’s gross domestic product will fall 1 percent this year
after a 2.2 percent decline in 2012, the Brussels-based
commission said.  The confidence index rose as executives grew optimistic
about the outlook for orders and production, today’s report
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
