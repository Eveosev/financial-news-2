Russian stocks traded in New York
are set for their  biggest monthly plunge  since May after a slump
in commodities sank  OAO Mechel (MTL)  and OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most traded
Russian equities in New York fell 0.5 percent to 100.10
yesterday, extending the gauge’s slump this month to 5.1
percent.  Mechel (MTLR) , the nation’s biggest maker of steelmaking coal,
declined to the lowest level in seven months as Norilsk, the
world’s largest producer of nickel, dropped 9.9 percent in
February. Futures expiring next month on Moscow’s dollar-
denominated RTS equity index rose 0.3 percent during New York
hours to 153,300.  Oil retreated 5 percent this month and commodities dropped
the most since October as inconclusive elections in Italy
spurred concern that Europe’s debt crisis may worsen a week
after minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s meeting showed policy
makers were divided over its bond buying program. Europe,
Russia’s biggest trading partner, accounts for about half of OAO
 Gazprom (OGZPY) ’s total energy sales.  “We are facing a lot of uncertainty over Italy, as it may
take them months to get a functional government, while the EU is
the main market for Russian exports,”  Alec Young , a global
equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said by phone from New York
yesterday. “Russian equities fell as commodities declined.”
There were “some concerns over the premature end to the
program, following the release of minutes by the Federal Reserve
last week,” he said.  The Russia-US gauge  sank  22 percent in May, the biggest
retreat since 2008, as German business confidence fell more than
economists forecast and speculation Greece might leave the euro
area clouded the economic outlook.  Curtailing Purchases  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S. exchange-
traded fund that holds Russian shares, gained 0.9 percent to
$29.05 yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures
expected swings in the index futures, was little changed at
22.04.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  defended the
central bank’s unprecedented asset purchases in his testimony to
the Senate Banking Committee in Washington yesterday, saying
they are supporting the expansion with little risk of inflation.
Bernanke used his testimony to push back against colleagues on
the  Federal Open Market Committee  who favor curtailing the $85
billion in monthly bond-buying.  Senate Control  Italy’s Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani won in
the Chamber of Deputies by a margin of less than half a
percentage point over former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi 
and will fall short of controlling the Senate. A political
stalemate would threaten to derail 15 months of austerity under
Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s government, reviving speculation
the country will struggle to pay its debt.  Oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, fell 0.5 percent to
$92.63 a barrel in New York yesterday, while the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI raw materials index dropped 0.8 percent to a one-
month low of 653.56.  Brent crude  for April settlement on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange declined 1.5 to $112.71 a barrel. Urals
crude slid 0.7 percent to $110.10, to cap a 3.8 percent retreat
in February.  “Oil price is an extremely strong factor when it comes to
Russian equities in every sector of the economy,”  Mark Rubinstein , the head of research at IFC Metropol in Moscow, said
by phone yesterday. “As oil price drops, investors’ appetite
for Russian risk vanishes.”  American depositary receipts of  Mechel (MTLR)  sank 1.2 percent to
$5.58, the lowest level since July 25. The ADRs are down 17
percent this month. The ruble-denominated Moscow-listed  stock 
tumbled 2 percent to 174.60 rubles, or the equivalent of $5.70.  Norilsk, Gazprom  Norilsk retreated 2.3 percent to $17.91 in New York after
shares lost 1.4 percent to 5,493 rubles, or the equivalent of
$179.05 in Moscow. One ADR equals one-10th of a share.  Gazprom, the world’s biggest producer of natural gas and
Russia’s largest company, fell 0.4 percent to $8.91 in New York.
The  company  dropped 1.1 percent to 136.52 rubles, or $4.46, in
Moscow yesterday. One ADR equals two shares.  Russia’s ruble declined 0.4 percent to 30.6345 per dollar,
the weakest level since Dec. 25. The currency lost 0.3 percent
to 34.8557 against the dollar-euro basket used by Russia’s
central bank to manage swings that erode exporter
competitiveness.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
climbed 1.8 percent to HK$4.46 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:03
a.m. local time. The company said yesterday that $7 million in
claims by Russia’s tax service against Rusal’s foil unit were
“unjustified” and that it will appeal a court decision that
led to a search of its Moscow office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
