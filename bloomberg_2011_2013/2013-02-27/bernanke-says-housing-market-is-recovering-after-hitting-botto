Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the U.S. housing market is on the road to
recovery.  “The evidence thus far is that the housing market has hit
the bottom,” Bernanke said in  Washington  today in response to
questions from members of the House Financial Services
Committee. “It’s recovering. We’ve seen rising prices in the
last year or so. We’ve seen significant increases in starts and
sales.”  Contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes climbed
more than forecast in January, a sign the industry will keep
strengthening this year, a report today showed.   The index of pending home resales increased 4.5 percent to
105.9, the highest level since April 2010, after a revised 1.9
percent drop the prior month, according to the National
Association of Realtors. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey called for a 1.9 percent advance.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
