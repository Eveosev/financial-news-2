The ruble declined against the
central bank’s target basket and yields on long-term Russian
 government bonds  remained near a three-month high after the
 Finance Ministry  sold 50 percent of a debt offering.  The Russian currency fell 0.1 percent to 34.8621 against
the central bank’s basket of dollars and euros by 7 p.m. in
Moscow. The ruble gained 0.1 percent against the dollar to
30.6085, paring its decline to the greenback this month to 1.9
percent. The yield on benchmark OFZ bonds due in February 2027
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.23 percent,
four basis points below this year’s highest level.  The Finance Ministry sold 12.2 billion rubles in five-year
OFZ bonds from an  auction  target today of 26.4 billion rubles of
the securities at an average yield of 6.20 percent, the top end
of guidance. The government shelved a planned sale of 15-year
bonds, citing an analysis of market conditions.  The ruble’s decline against the dollar this month has made
assets in the Russian currency less attractive to foreigners,
while the start to operations with Russian government debt by
Euroclear Bank SA hasn’t led to an influx of money, according to
Moscow-based brokerage Aton Capital.  “The launch of Euroclear settlements has so far resulted
in profit taking by foreign investors who bought ruble bonds
earlier, rather than new fund inflows,” Anna Bogdyukevich, a
fixed-income analyst at Aton, said in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
