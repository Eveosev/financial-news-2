Irish payrolls grew in the fourth
quarter for the first time in more than four years as employers
hired more part-time staff and emigration reduced the number of
unemployed.  The number of people in work  rose 0.1 percent  from the
year-earlier period to 1.849 million, the first increase since
the second quarter of 2008, the  Central Statistics Office  said
in Dublin today. The  unemployment rate  was  unchanged  at 14.1
percent in February after the January rate was revised down.  “The economy seems to be generating a little more activity
and that’s now proving sufficient to stabilize numbers at
work,” said  Austin Hughes , chief economist at KBC Bank Ireland
Plc in Dublin. “It’s no dramatic turnaround in the economy.
It’s still quite a struggle and we’re going to see fairly
limited growth this year.”  Ireland’s unemployment rate has tripled since 2007 as a
crash in the country’s property market led to the loss of more
than 170,000 construction jobs. Increased hiring in Ireland by
U.S. companies such as Google Inc. and  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  is helping to
ease jobless queues as government austerity measures continue to
constrain the domestic economy.  Gross domestic product  rose 0.2 percent in the third
quarter after a 0.4 percent gain in the previous three months.
The government forecasts growth of 1.5 percent this year.  Job Creation  EBay said on Feb. 14 that it plans to create 450 jobs in
Ireland on top of about 1,000 announced last year by its
payments unit, PayPal Inc. Facebook Inc. said this month it
plans to hire 100 people in Ireland this year.  A 3.2 percent increase in part-time employment in the
fourth quarter offset a 0.9 percent decline in full-time jobs,
today’s report showed. The seasonally adjusted fourth-quarter
jobless rate fell to 14.2 percent from 14.6 percent.  Net emigration is helping to cushion unemployment numbers,
according to the CSO. The number of people in the  labor force 
fell by 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
