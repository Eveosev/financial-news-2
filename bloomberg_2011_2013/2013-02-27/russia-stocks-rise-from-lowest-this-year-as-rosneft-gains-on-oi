Russian stocks  climbed from the
lowest level this year as rising crude prices lifted OAO
Rosneft, the country’s biggest oil producer.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.2 percent to 1,488.28 by 10:37 a.m.
in Moscow, after plunging 1.3 percent yesterday to the lowest
since Dec. 28. Of 50 stocks, 38 increased, one was unchanged and
11 decreased.  Oil in  New York  added 0.2 percent to $92.79, the first
advance in three days. Oil and natural gas account for about 50
percent of  Russia ’s budget revenue. Rosneft, which has the
fourth-largest weighting on the Micex at 5.6 percent, gained 0.6
percent.  “For now, markets are staging a minor bounce,” UralSib
Capital analysts wrote in an e-mailed report.  OAO Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port surged 1.7 percent,
the strongest increase on the index, as OAO Transneft said it
won’t call for the sea port’s board to change management,
according to a statement on the oil pipeline operator’s website
yesterday.  Transneft Vice President Maxim Grishanin had called on the
port’s board to resign on Feb. 18. Transneft and Summa Group
control 50.1 percent of the port. Ziyavudin Magomedov, the
former chairman of Novorossiysk and the founder of Summa Group,
remains on the port’s board, while Marat Shaydaev, a former
president at Summa, is the current chairman.  “The disagreement between Summa and Transneft is likely to
come to an end, which is positive since the stock has been
pressured in recent weeks as the conflict between the two
parties escalated,” VTB Capital analysts said in an e-mailed
note.  Price Swings  Thirty-day price swings  on the Micex fell to 12.261, while
the number of shares traded on the gauge was 24 percent above
the measure’s 30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials was steady at
653.70.  The Micex trades at about 5.6 times  estimated earnings  and
has added 0.9 percent this year. That compares with a multiple
of 10 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, which lost 1
percent over the same period.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, gained 0.9 percent to $29.05
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the index futures, was little changed at 22.04
yesterday. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-
traded Russian stocks in the U.S. fell 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
