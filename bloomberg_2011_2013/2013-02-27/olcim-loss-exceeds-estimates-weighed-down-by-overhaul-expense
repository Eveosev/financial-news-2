Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s largest
cement-maker, reported a bigger-than-estimated loss in the
fourth quarter on restructuring charges and said it’s become
less optimistic about European markets.  The loss narrowed to 161 million francs ($172.7 million)
from a 438 million-franc loss a year earlier, the company said.
Analysts predicted a loss of 79.3 million francs. Sales rose 1.2
percent to 5.4 billion francs, compared with a 5.5 billion-franc
prediction.  Chief Executive Officer Bernard Fontana is in the midst of
overhauling Holcim’s European business as a construction slump
erodes demand for cement. Holcim said in December it is
accelerating a program to deal with underperforming European
plants as peers from France’s  Lafarge SA (LG)  to Mexico’s  Cemex SAB
de CV (CEMEXCPO)  sell assets to cut debt acquired in pre-crisis takeovers.  Cash restructuring costs of 181 million francs and 457
million francs in asset write-offs hurt fourth-quarter results
as Holcim adjusted capacity from Belgium to Italy. The Jona-
based cement-maker said in December it would book a 410-million-
franc charge for writedowns on property, plants and equipment
related to a European re-structuring.  Rival Lafarge SA reported earnings last week that beat
analyst estimates as sales rose in  Asia  and Latin America.
 HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  also beat predictions. Holcim’s
restructuring costs for the 2012 full-year increased 50 percent
from a year earlier to 1 billion francs, the Swiss company said.  Better 2013  Holcim forecast a significant growth in operating profit in
2013 on rising cement sales in Asia,  North America  and  Latin
America  and as efficiency improvements from a savings program
begun by Fontana last year gain momentum.  Holcim, which has promised to save 1.5 billion francs with
efficiency gains in areas like procurement and logistics by
2014, raised 375 million francs in December through asset sales
in Thailand and Guatemala.  The company proposed a dividend of 1.15 francs a share,
beating the 1.10 franc estimate of analysts in Bloomberg data.
Shares in Holcim fell 0.4 percent to 71.65 francs at 10 a.m. in
Zurich. Volume traded was 77 percent of the three month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
