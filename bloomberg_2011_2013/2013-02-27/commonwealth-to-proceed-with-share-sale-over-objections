CommonWealth REIT (CWH)  said it would
proceed with a planned offering of 27 million shares, rejecting
a call from activist investors to scuttle the sale.  “The best interests of CommonWealth will be served by
CommonWealth continuing the common share offering and debt
tender offer previously announced,” the Newton, Massachusetts-
based real estate investment trust said in a statement today.  CommonWealth said two days ago that it would issue stock
and use the $450 million in proceeds to retire some of its debt.
Activist investor Keith Meister and Related Cos., who together
own 9.8 percent of the REIT’s existing shares, challenged the
plan yesterday, saying they’re prepared to make a bid of $25 a
share, or $2.1 billion, for the company. They are also prepared
to file a lawsuit to stop the share issue, according to a  letter 
sent to CommonWealth by Related and Meister’s firm, Corvex
Management LP.  Issuing 27 million additional shares will dilute
CommonWealth’s outstanding stock by more than 30 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, lowering the dividends
paid to shareholders. REITs, whose primary income streams are
from real estate, are required by the  Internal Revenue Service 
to distribute at least 90 percent of their taxable earnings to
shareholders in the form of dividends. In exchange they pay
little or no income tax.  Shares of CommonWealth jumped 54 percent yesterday, the
most since at least 1986, after Corvex and Related challenged
the offering. The  stock  closed at $24.40.  If the company doesn’t cancel the share offering, Corvex
and Related may try to replace members of the  board , including
CommonWealth President Adam Portnoy and his father, Chairman
Barry Portnoy, according to a regulatory filing yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
