Conning Holdings Corp., the asset
manager controlled by Jeff Greenberg’s Aquiline Capital Partners
LLC, named David Marks and Ron Joelson to its board as the
company seeks to expand offerings to insurance clients.  Joelson is chief investment officer of Northwestern Mutual
Life Insurance Co., where he oversees a $174 billion portfolio,
Hartford, Connecticut-based Conning said today in a statement.
Marks is CIO of insurer CUNA Mutual Group. Both have more than
three decades of experience in the industry, Conning said.  Adding Joelson and Marks reflects Conning’s need “to have
more partners in the industry who are active investors and
active in the insurance business,” Chief Executive Officer
Woody Bradford said in a phone interview. “That’s how I view
Ron and David, as partners, to help us grow the company.”  Bradford is bolstering Conning’s oversight and resources as
he competes with JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  and other asset managers for mandates.  Low
interest rates  have pressured insurers’ investment income and
spurred some companies to outsource part of their portfolios to
specialized investment firms.  Conning oversaw about $91 billion at the end of December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
