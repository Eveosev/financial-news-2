A group of 28 Czech senators
submitted a request to file treason charges against President
Vaclav Klaus over an amnesty he granted to thousands at the
start of the year.  The upper house of parliament, controlled by the opposition
Social Democrats, will vote on the request if the chamber’s
administrative committee rules the proposal is valid, the
Prague-based Senate said on its  website  today. If approved, the
charges would be filed at the Constitutional Court.  The Social Democrats, the most popular party in opinion
polls and the largest in both houses of the legislature, has
criticized Klaus’s amnesty of convicted criminals and suspects
and last month initiated a no-confidence vote against the
government over the President’s move. Klaus has repeatedly said
the amnesty was in line with legislation.  Klaus, the Czech Republic’s highest-profile critic of the
European Union and its common currency, will leave his post next
week when his second and the final term expires on March 7. One
of his most eminent acts during the 10-year presidency was to
delay signing of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty in 2009.  The request for treason charges includes Klaus’s refusal to
sign the amendment to the treaty that created the European
Stability Mechanism, the bloc’s rescue fund, the CTK newswire
reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
