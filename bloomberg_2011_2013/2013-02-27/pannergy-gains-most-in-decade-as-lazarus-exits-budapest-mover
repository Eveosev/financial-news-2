Pannergy (PANNERGY)  Nyrt., a Hungarian
renewable energy company, had the biggest two-day gain in more
than 14 years as Lazarus Vagyonkezelo Zrt. sold its last shares
in the company, ending a forced liquidation process.  The shares rose 15 percent to close at 379 forint in
Budapest, extending the two-day gain to 32 percent, the biggest
such advance since September 1998. Pannergy slumped 50 percent
from the start of 2013 through Feb. 25 as Lazarus unwound its
position. Lazarus held a 9.6 percent stake in Pannergy as of
Nov. 19, according to the energy company’s website.  Lazarus sold 1.98 million Pannergy shares yesterday at 275
forint each, reducing its stake to zero, Pannergy said in a
 statement  to the Budapest Stock Exchange. ONP Holdings SE, a
part-owner of a Pannergy geothermal plant, bought 2.6 million
shares at the same price, Pannergy said in a separate statement.
The transactions will help relieve the pressure the Lazarus
liquidation had put on Pannergy’s stock,  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  said.  “Although the news is rather positive, we still see many
uncertainties in connection with Lazarus’ forced liquidation and
the current ONP transaction,” Peter Szentirmai, a Budapest-
based analyst at KBC Groep NV, wrote in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
