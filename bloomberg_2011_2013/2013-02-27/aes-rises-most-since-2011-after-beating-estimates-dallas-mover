     Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) -- AES (AES)  Corp., the power producer with
operations in 25 countries, rose the most in 18 months after
reporting fourth-quarter profit that beat analystsâ€™ estimates.  AES, based in Arlington, Virginia, rose 6.3 percent to
$11.64 at the close in  New York , the most since Aug. 11, 2011.  Net income attributable to AES was $175 million, or 23
cents a share, compared with a loss of $209 million or 27 cents
a year earlier, AES reported today in a filing. Profit was 32
cents excluding one-time items, 2 cents better than the average
of seven  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  AES also today announced plans to buy back another $300
million shares, according to a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Andres Gluski has cut costs, sold
assets and begun distributing dividends since assuming the post
in September 2011.  The company will exit five countries this year, using the
proceeds to fund $1.4 billion of plant improvements or
expansions in the U.S.,  Chile , the  Philippines  and India, Gluski
said on an earnings call today. The improvements are expected to
generate returns of 14 percent in 2015, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
