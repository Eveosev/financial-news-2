The BRICS group of emerging-market
nations will consider plans to pool foreign-currency reserves
when heads of state meet next month, South African Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  The funds may be used to “support each other at times of
balance of payments or currency crisis,” Gordhan said in his
budget speech in Cape Town today. China, Russia, Brazil, India
and  South Africa  have combined reserves of $4.5 trillion, he
said.  BRICS leaders meeting in Durban, South Africa in March will
also discuss proposals to create a regional  development bank  and
set up a trade insurance fund, Gordhan said.  A BRICS-led bank “is intended to mobilize domestic savings
and co-fund infrastructure in developing regions,” he said.
“Work is under way on creating a trade and development risk
pool. The aim is to establish a sustainable and alternative
insurance and reinsurance network for the BRICS countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
