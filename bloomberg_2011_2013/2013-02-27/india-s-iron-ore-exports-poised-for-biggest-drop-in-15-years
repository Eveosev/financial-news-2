Iron ore  shipments from  India , the
world’s third-largest exporter of the commodity, are headed for
the biggest decline in at least 15 years as a mining ban in a
key producing region erodes output.  Exports of the steelmaking ingredient tumbled 68 percent to
16.4 million metric tons in the 10 months ended Jan. 31,
according to a statement e-mailed by the Federation of Indian
Mineral Industries today. Exports may be about 17 million tons
in the year ending March 31, said the industry group’s Secretary
General R.K. Sharma. That’s the lowest since at least fiscal
1999, according to Sharma and government data.  In September, Goa, the nation’s biggest exporter, banned
all mining after a government panel said the state’s exchequer
lost an estimated 349.4 billion rupees ($6.5 billion) because of
illegal mining. The nation’s top court extended the halt in
October. About 127 million tons of  iron ore  was mined illegally
between 2006 and 2011, the panel, headed by former Judge M.B.
Shah, said in its September report.  Shipments from Goa fell 69 percent to 10.6 million tons
from 34 million tons a year ago in the 10-month period.  Higher taxes and freight charges on iron ore also impeded
shipments, said Sharma. The export levy was increased to 30
percent in December 2011 on all grades of ore from 20 percent,
while the railways increased freight charges to ports by as much
as four times to encourage local supplies.  “Shipments have been abysmal and this trend is likely to
continue unless freight and taxes on iron ore meant for exports
are reduced,” Sharma said.  Exports from the Paradip port in the eastern state of
Odisha declined 81 percent to 1.1 million tons, while overseas
shipments from Haldia port declined 70 percent to 950,000 tons,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
