A majority of Dutch lawmakers backed
a 5.7 billion-euro ($7.5 billion) guarantee the government gave
to the central bank, a move that should help ease the nation’s
budget deficit.  The state provided a guarantee covering loans the central
bank provided to the European System of Central Banks, the
government said on Feb. 15. The state expects to earn about 3.2
billion euros from the commitment between 2013 to 2017 and the
budget gap will be reduced by 813 million euros this year and
877 million euros in 2014, the government said. The central bank
and the  Ministry of Finance  haven’t explained how these amounts
were calculated.  “This is a one big trick to make yourself rich with money
that isn’t there,” Tony van Dijck, a lawmaker from the
opposition  Freedom Party , said in parliament in The Hague today.
Lawmakers from the Liberal VVD party and the  Labor Party  that
make up the government coalition led by Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  defended the move.  The government may cut the 2014 budget by as much as 4
billion euros to keep the deficit within European Union limits,
RTL-Z reported yesterday, citing people with knowledge of the
matter. The cuts would come on top of a 16 billion-euro
austerity package in the next four years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
