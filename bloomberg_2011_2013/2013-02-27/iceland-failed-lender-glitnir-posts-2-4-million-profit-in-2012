Failed Icelandic lender Glitnir Bank
hf said profits rose 69 percent in 2012 as it struggles to reach
an agreement with the island’s central bank to begin
distributions to its creditors.  Profit rose to 301 million kronur ($2.4 million) in 2012
from 178 million kronur the previous year as it reversed
impairments, the Reykjavik-based lender said today.  The bank’s assets rose 5.7 percent to 934 billion kronur
from 883 billion kronur in 2011. The liabilities fell to 2.4
trillion kronur from 2.7 trillion kronur, according to the
 statement .  “In November 2012 a request was sent to the central bank
of Iceland for approval of the composition proposal,” the
lender’s winding-up committee said in the statement. “Glitnir
is waiting for response.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
