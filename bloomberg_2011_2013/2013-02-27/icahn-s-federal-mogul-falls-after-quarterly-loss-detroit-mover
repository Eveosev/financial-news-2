Federal-Mogul Corp. (FDML) , the auto-parts
supplier controlled by billionaire  Carl Icahn , dropped the most
in almost three months after the slowdown in Europe’s vehicle
market contributed to a third straight quarterly loss.  The  shares  fell 6.9 percent to $8.45 at the close in  New
York , the biggest decline since Dec. 3. They have gained
5.4 percent this year, as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose
6.3 percent.  Federal-Mogul said today that it will shut more factories,
mostly in western Europe, and shift the work by 2015 to lower-
cost locations such as Mexico, China and Poland. Last year, the
Southfield, Michigan-based company announced a $60 million
restructuring that included closing three plants by this July.
Vehicle sales in the  Europe  slumped to a 19-year low in 2012.  “This was really a very disappointing quarter,” Brian Sponheimer, a Gabelli & Co. analyst in Rye, New York, said in an
interview. He has a buy rating on Federal-Mogul shares.  Sponheimer said Federal Mogul “needs to effectively
address its cash in 2013 and there needs to be a clearer path
toward profitability” in its division that sell to automakers.  Federal-Mogul said in a statement today that it used
$480 million more cash in 2012 than it took in, and ended the
year with $467 million.  The fourth-quarter  net loss  narrowed to $80 million, or
81 cents a share, from $239 million, or $2.42, a year earlier,
the Southfield, Michigan-based company said. The loss excluding
items such as legal, impairment and restructuring costs was
$41 million, Federal-Mogul said. The single analyst estimate
compiled by Bloomberg was for adjusted profit of $15 million.  Sales fell 3.6 percent to $1.6 billion, beating the
$1.55 billion average of two estimates. Gross margin fell to
10.5 percent of sales, from 14.9 percent a year earlier.  Federal-Mogul didn’t break out its 2012 sales by country or
region. In 2011,  Germany , France,  Italy ,  Switzerland  and the
U.K. combined for 39 percent of the company’s  revenue , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Icahn controlled 78 percent of Federal-Mogul’s  shares  as of
Dec. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
