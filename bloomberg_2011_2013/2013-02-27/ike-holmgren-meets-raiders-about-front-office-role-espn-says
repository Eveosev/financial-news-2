Former  Green Bay Packers  and Seattle
Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren has met with the Oakland Raiders
about a top front-office role,  ESPN reported , citing two
unidentified people familiar with the situation.  Holmgren, 64, was ousted as the Cleveland Browns’ president
after the 2012 National Football League season.  Holmgren previously worked with Raiders General Manager
Reggie McKenzie, who was the Packers’ director of football
operations from 2008-2011. While there is no timetable for the
Raiders to hire a top executive, part of the job would be to
lead the push for a new stadium, ESPN said.  Holmgren led the 1996 Packers to the Super Bowl title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
