West Texas Intermediate was poised
for its first monthly decline since October. U.S. crude
stockpiles rose less than forecast, and fuel demand increased in
the world’s biggest oil consumer.  Futures dropped as much as 0.4 percent, and have lost 5.2
percent this month, the first February since 2006 that WTI has
fallen. Crude supplies climbed  1.1 million barrels  last week,
data from the Energy Department showed, more than the 2.5
million increase forecast in a Bloomberg survey. U.S. fuel
 consumption  averaged 18.5 million barrels a day over the past
four weeks, up 2 percent from 2012, according to the report.  “The EIA delivered a mixed set of U.S. fuel inventory
numbers,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in
London who predicts that WTI will trade from $90 to $94.70 a
barrel next month. “We are in the refinery maintenance season,
when demand slackens.”  WTI for April delivery was down 11 cents at $92.65 a barrel
in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at
12:47 a.m. in London. The volume of all futures traded was 29
percent below the 100-day average.  Brent for April settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange advanced 35 cents to $112.22 a barrel. Volumes
were about 45 percent of the 100-day average. The European
benchmark grade was at a premium of $19.57 to WTI futures,
compared with $19.11 yesterday.  Fuel Supplies  U.S. gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.9 million barrels last
week, the EIA report showed. They were projected to decline by 1
million, according to the  median estimate  of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Distillate inventories, including heating
oil and diesel, increased 557,000 barrels, the data showed.
Supplies were expected to decrease by 1.55 million.  Iran  hailed a positive “turning point” after talks about
its nuclear program with Western officials. The Islamic
republic’s negotiator,  Saeed Jalili , said yesterday a “more
realistic and logical” proposal was made by the U.S. and its
five partners at the two-day session in Almaty,  Kazakhstan .  In exchange for Iran agreeing to cease its output of 20
percent enriched uranium, the group offered to ease restrictions
on its exports of petrochemical products and some additional
items, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said.
Jalili told reporters that technical talks will be held in
Istanbul on March 18, and political discussions with
international negotiators will resume in Almaty on April 5.  Bollinger Band  WTI has technical support along its lower Bollinger Band,
about $92.35 a barrel today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures yesterday traded below the indicator for a
fifth day before settling higher, signaling chart support, where
buy orders may be clustered.  Orders for U.S. durable goods excluding transportation
equipment, which is often volatile, climbed 1.9 percent in
January, exceeding all forecasts of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, Commerce Department data showed. An index of pending
home resales rose 4.5 percent to 105.9, the most since April
2010, the National Association of Realtors said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
