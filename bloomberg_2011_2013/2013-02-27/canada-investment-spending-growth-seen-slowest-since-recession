 Canadian investment spending will
increase this year at the slowest pace since the 2009 recession,
a government survey projects, adding to evidence there may be
little scope for growth to accelerate in the world’s 11th-
largest economy.  Spending on construction, machinery and equipment will
increase 1.7 percent to C$398.2 billion ($388 billion) in 2013,
following a 7.2 percent rise in 2012, Statistics  Canada  said
today in Ottawa, based on a survey of businesses and
governments. Excluding housing, investment may grow 2.2 percent
after a 6.5 percent gain in 2012, the agency said.  The report suggests businesses aren’t picking up the slack
created by slowing spending from indebted households, amid
sluggish global demand and weak commodity prices.  Bank of Canada 
Governor  Mark Carney  said Feb. 25 the “rotation” of demand
from the country’s indebted households to businesses “is the
fundamental challenge” for the country’s economy.  “Canadian businesses have taken a cautious turn amid an
uncertain outlook and weaker commodity prices,”  Benjamin Reitzes , a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto,
said in a note to investors. “The softness in private sector
capital spending intentions doesn’t bode well for 2013 growth,
especially given hopes the sector would be a key contributor.”  Canada’s currency slipped 0.1 percent to C$1.0267 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:12 a.m. Toronto time. One Canadian dollar buys
97.40 U.S. cents. Swaps trading suggests investors are pricing
in 12 basis points of easing by the Bank of Canada by its Dec. 4
announcement.  Weakest Pace  Recent data suggest Canada’s economy is  growing  at the
weakest pace since 2009 as the nation’s exporters struggle to
sell goods abroad.  Statistics Canada  releases fourth-quarter
growth figures on March 1 that are projected to show output
stalled at an annualized 0.6 percent in the last three months of
2012, according to economists  surveyed  by  Bloomberg News .  The Bank of Canada forecast gross domestic product
increased at a 1 percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter,
and projects 2 percent growth for 2013.  Eight of the 21 industries  tracked  by Statistics Canada
will record declines in capital spending this year, and another
seven will post slowing growth. The survey of 28,000 private and
government organizations was conducted between October and
January, the statistics agency said.  Oil, Gas  Investment by mining, oil and gas companies will decrease
2.7 percent, after increasing 4.1 percent in 2012, largely
reflecting a 32 percent decline by the metal ore mining
industry, Statistics Canada said.  Capital spending  by the oil
and gas industry will rise 0.8 percent to C$58.8 billion,
unchanged from 2012.  Non-residential construction will rise 1.4 percent, after
growth of 7.2 percent in 2012, while spending on machinery and
equipment will increase 3.6 percent, compared with a 2012 gain
of 5.3 percent, the survey showed.  The transportation and warehousing industry will record the
biggest gains in spending, a 12.8 percent increase that reflects
gains in expenditures to build new pipelines, Statistics Canada
said.  Housing investment is forecast to rise 0.2 percent,
following a 9.3 percent gain in 2012. Investment spending by
government and state-owned companies will grow 5 percent in
2013, from 4.9 percent in 2012, led by new planned investments
by utilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
