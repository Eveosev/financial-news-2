Taiwan ’s industrial output rose more
than economists estimated in January, as a recovery in  China 
boosted demand for the island’s goods and construction picked up.  Production climbed 19.17 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a revised 2.05 percent gain in December, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said in Taipei today. The median of
11 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was 16.8 percent.  China’s recovery from a seven-quarter growth slowdown and a
rebound in housing in the U.S. are adding to signs that the
global economy is strengthening. Taiwan’s  export orders , an
indicator of shipments in the next one to three months, climbed
the most in two years in January, a report showed yesterday.  “Taiwan’s manufacturing sector has been recovering after
an increase in exports,” Laura Ho, an economist at Taipei-based
Jih Sun Securities Investment Consulting Co., said before the
report. “We expect the growth momentum to persist in the rest
of the year.”  Manufacturing on the island climbed 19.86 percent last
month from a year earlier, while construction gained 11.74
percent, today’s report showed.  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.705 against
its U.S. counterpart. The benchmark Taiex Index of stocks
advanced 0.2 percent at the 1:30 p.m. close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
