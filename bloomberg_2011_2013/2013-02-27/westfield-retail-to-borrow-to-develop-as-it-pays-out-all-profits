Westfield Retail Trust (WRT) , Australia’s
second-biggest property trust by market value, will take out
loans to fund A$1.2 billion ($1.2 billion) of redevelopments as
it pays out all its earnings to shareholders.  The company will start work on two malls in New South Wales
and Queensland states as part of a plan to undertake about A$200
million of redevelopments a year on existing properties, Domenic Panaccio, the trust’s managing director, said. It can
“comfortably” boost its debt to 28 percent of equity, from
20.7 percent as of Dec. 31, he said.  “Our  balance sheet  is very strong and we have low gearing,
so we can afford to provide higher cash returns and still
continue to execute our strategy,” Panaccio said in a telephone
interview from Sydney. “We have lots of capacity to fund
projects.”  Westfield Retail, the  Australia  and New Zealand-focused
company spun off by Westfield Group, today reported a 2 percent
increase in distributable  earnings  to A$572.6 million in the 12
months to Dec. 31. It will  pay out  the full amount in dividends,
equating to 18.75 cents a share. The company will continue to
pay out all its distributable earnings in 2013, which it
forecasts to be 19.85 a share, it said.  The  shares  rose 1.6 percent to A$3.19 as of 2:17 p.m. in
Sydney, extending this year’s gain to 5.5 percent. That compares
with a 0.7 percent advance in the benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51) 
today.  Increases in the ratio of debt to equity may be offset by
the rise in values resulting from the redevelopment of its malls,
Panaccio said.  Westfield Retail and its manager and joint venture partner
 Westfield Group (WDC)  last year completed the development of a new
mall in Sydney’s city center. They also finished the
redevelopment of the Westfield Fountain Gate shopping center in
 Melbourne , which resulted in a A$107 million increase in the
mall’s value for the trust.  Westfield Group today reported an 18 percent increase in
profit to A$1.72 billion, driven by real estate management fees
and development income, and a recovery in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
