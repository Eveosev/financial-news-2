The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development may lend as much as 10.8 million euros ($14
million) to Vital SA, a Romanian regional utility, to improve
the water network of the northern county of Maramures.  The London-based bank’s loan will co-fund a 148.2 million-
euro regional investment program by the European Union and
Romania, the EBRD said today in a statement on its website. The
bank’s board will meet to discuss the loan May 29, it said.  “Investments are expected to significantly reduce water
losses, optimize operating costs and expand water supply and
wastewater collection and treatment services in Maramures County
in line with the relevant EU directives,” the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
