AES Gener SA (AESGENER) , Chile’s second-largest
power producer by revenue, led gains on Chile’s benchmark index
after reporting profit that beat analysts’ estimates as a jump
in energy sales blunted higher costs.  AES Gener advanced 1.4 percent to 325 pesos at 1:09 p.m. in
Santiago, the highest closing price since Feb. 15. The power
producer closed at an all-time high 329.51 pesos on Feb. 4.  The company, a unit of Arlington, Virginia-based  AES Corp. (AES) ,
reported yesterday fourth-quarter net income of $75.4 million,
down from $89.4 million a year before and 22 percent above an
average estimate of $61.9 million among three analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  “We should see a positive effect in the market after this
report,” Corpbanca analysts including Cristobal Lyon and Sergio Zapata said in a note to clients today.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, grew 13 percent to $185 million, which
compares with an average estimate of $156 million.  AES Gener revenue rose 29 percent in  Chile  last year as
sales costs jumped 20 percent in the period, according to
documents on the website of Chile’s securities regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
