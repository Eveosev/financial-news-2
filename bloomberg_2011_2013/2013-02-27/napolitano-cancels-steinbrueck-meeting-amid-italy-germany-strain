Italian President Giorgio Napolitano
canceled a meeting with  Peer Steinbrueck  after the candidate to
be Germany’s next chancellor ridiculed the results of this
week’s election in Italy.  The meeting, scheduled for today in Germany, was called
off, a spokesman for Napolitano said by phone. Steinbrueck’s
comments, reported in German newspapers today, were “totally
out of place,” Napolitano told journalists in Munich.  The inconclusive Feb. 24-25 election intensified tensions
between the two countries as Italian voters rejected the fiscal
austerity pushed by Germany as the cure for Europe’s debt
crisis. Former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  and ex-comic
Beppe Grillo, who pledged to roll back the budget rigor imposed
by outgoing premier Mario Monti, won about 55 percent of the
popular vote.  Steinbrueck said yesterday that he was “horrified that two
clowns won the election.”  Napolitano traveled to Germany yesterday and will remain in
the country until March 1. He is scheduled to meet  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  and President Joachim Gauck.  To contact the reporters on this story:
