Styrolution Group GmbH, the plastics
venture formed by  BASF SE (BAS)  and Ineos Group AG, forecast the
automotive industry will be a bright spot for sales and earnings
this year, countering weakened markets in  Europe .  The U.S. car industry has seen a “significant” revival,
the Frankfurt-based company said in a statement. Earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will likely
exceed last year’s result, as a result of cost-savings, it said.  “We anticipate sales will be buoyed up globally by the
automotive sector,” Styrolution said.  Chief Executive Officer Roberto Gualdoni is using an
efficiency drive as he combines the operations of Ineos and BASF
into a 6 billion-euro ($7.8 billion) company. He aims to reduce
costs by more than 200 million euros by 2016 and Styrolution
said today the program is ahead of schedule with 80 percent of
annual targets to be achieved this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
