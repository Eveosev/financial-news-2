Rasheed Wallace, who has missed the
 New York  Knicks’ past 31 National Basketball Association games,
probably will be out for another eight weeks after tests showed
he’ll need surgery on a broken bone in his left foot.  Wallace, 38, hasn’t played since Dec. 13 because of a
stress reaction in his foot. The Knicks said in a statement
today that new X-rays revealed “progression” to a fractured
fifth metatarsal, requiring Wallace to have surgery this week.  Recovery time is about eight weeks, which would keep him
out until the end of April. The Knicks’ regular season schedule
ends April 17, meaning Wallace may be able to return if the team
makes the playoffs. New York is in first place in the Eastern
Conference’s  Atlantic Division  with a 33-20 record.  Wallace, a 6-foot-11 former All-Star, ended a two-year
retirement when he signed with the Knicks in October. In 20
games off the bench, he averaged 7.2 points and 4.2 rebounds.  The Knicks signed 35-year-old forward Kenyon Martin last
week because of the injuries to Wallace and 38-year-old Marcus Camby, who has been sidelined since mid-January with a left foot
injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
