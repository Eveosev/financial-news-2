Centrica Plc, the biggest power and
gas supplier to U.K. homes, said it’s in talks with a financial
partner to develop the 580-megawatt Race Bank offshore wind
project.  Centrica is prepared to commit 200 million pounds ($302
million) of its own money to Race Bank, off the coast of eastern
 England , the utility said today in a statement. It’s in talks
with the government and a financial partner it didn’t name over
the economic framework that will underpin the farm, the Windsor,
England-based company said.  “We will only invest for value and will seek to reduce our
equity ownership through partnering where appropriate,”
Centrica said of its offshore wind projects. The utility in
March sold 50 percent of its interest in as many as 4.2
gigawatts of wind projects in the Irish Sea to Dong Energy A/S.  The U.K. has just under 3 gigawatts of  Europe ’s 5 gigawatts
of installed offshore wind turbines, according to the European
Wind Energy Association. The country is banking on the
technology to help meet its European Union renewable energy
targets, and plans to install a total of 18 gigawatts of
offshore wind farms by 2020.  Centrica’s 270-megawatt Lincs project, between the coast
and Race Bank, has generated its first power and is expected to
be fully operational in the second half of this year, the
company said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
