PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  shelved plans to build
a $140 million drinks plant in  Russia  after acquiring local
dairy and juice producer OAO Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods in 2011, the
company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The company announced it would build the plant in Rostov
region, southern Russia, in 2010. The plan was “delayed
indefinitely” after PepsiCo bought Will-Bill-Dann, becoming
Russia’s largest food and beverage producer, spokesman Sergey
Glushkov said in the statement.  After the acquisition, PepsiCo has 40 production units in
Russia and ex-Soviet states and needs to develop them, Glushkov
said. The company plans to invest “several hundreds of millions
of dollars” to develop in Russia, Zein Abdalla, then-chief
executive officer for PepsiCo  Europe , said last year. Abdalla
became president of PepsiCo in September.  PepsiCo acquired 66 percent of Wimm-Bill-Dann in 2011 for
$3.8 billion from Russian controlling owners and then bought out
minorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
