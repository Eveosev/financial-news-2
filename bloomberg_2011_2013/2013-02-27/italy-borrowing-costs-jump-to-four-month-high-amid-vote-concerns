Italy  managed to sell the maximum
6.5 billion euros ($8.5 billion) at a bond auction today as the
country’s inconclusive elections forced the Treasury to offer
higher yields, fueling an increase in demand for the debt.  The Treasury in  Rome  today sold 4 billion euros of a new
10-year bond due 2023 at 4.83 percent, up from 4.17 percent at
an auction of similar-maturity debt on Jan. 30 and the highest
since Oct. 30. It also sold 2.5 billion euros of bonds due in
2017 at 3.59 percent compared with 2.94 percent last month.  Investors bid for 1.65 times the amount of the 10-year debt
offered, up from 1.32 times Jan. 30, and for 1.61 times the
amount of the five-year bonds compared with 1.30 last month.  “Demand for both lines was relatively solid, probably led
by domestic accounts who took advantage of higher yields,”
Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in
 London , said by e-mail. “We rule out foreign accounts have
played a major role at today’s auction as political risks remain
high.’  This week’s vote produced a hung parliament, with comedian
Beppe Grillo’s anti-austerity movement winning more than 25
percent of the popular vote, creating the risk of another
election later this year. The outcome raises the chance for
prolonged uncertainty, putting Italy’s sovereign credit rating
at risk of a downgrade, Moody’s Investors Service said today.  New Election?  President Giorgio Napolitano may be forced to call new
elections if the coalition led by Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani, who won the Chamber of Deputies by a thin margin,
fails to form a government.  Ten-year bond yields surged the most in 14 months yesterday
amid rising political concerns. Italy’s 10-year yield dropped 7
basis points to 4.83 percent at 2:10 p.m. in Rome. The yield
difference with  Germany  narrowed 6 basis points today to 339
after jumping 51 basis points yesterday.  “A minority government or an unstable government until
there are new elections a few months from now means that
investors might short Italian debt, spreads may keep rising and
the shield that’s supposed to be there isn’t there,”  Nouriel
Roubini , the  New York  University professor who predicted the
2008 financial crisis, said in an interview at a Doverie
conference in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia. “That could
create a vicious circle.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
