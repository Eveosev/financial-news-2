Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  was fined
NT$5 million ($168,500) for inadequate internal controls after
an employee in Taiwan embezzled funds through a  credit card 
business-related loophole.  The Financial Supervisory Commission also ordered the bank
to fire the employee in the case, according to a statement on
its website yesterday.  “We respect the regulator’s decision and we take this
matter seriously,” Joyce Li, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman at
Standard Chartered, said in an e-mail. “This is an isolated
incident and we have taken actions to prevent re-occurrence.”  This was the second time in less than a year that Taiwan’s
financial regulator penalized the London-based bank. The FSC
fined Standard Chartered NT$6 million in August over lax
customer data controls, and barred the lender from accepting
faxed applications for credit loans for the rest of 2012.  Standard Chartered in December agreed to pay $327 million
of fines to U.S. authorities after regulators alleged it
violated U.S. sanctions with Iran.  To contact the reporters on this story:
