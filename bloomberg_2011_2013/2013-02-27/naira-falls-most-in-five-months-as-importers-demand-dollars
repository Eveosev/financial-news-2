Nigeria ’s naira fell the most in
almost five months as importers demanded dollars to settle oil
bills and foreign-exchange obligations.  Nigeria’s currency retreated 0.4 percent to 158.25 per
dollar as of 3:21 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, the
biggest decline on a closing basis since Oct. 5, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, relies on imports
to cover 70 percent of its own fuel needs because of inadequate
refining capacity. Fuel imports are a source of pressure on the
naira, according to the central bank.  “The weakening of the naira is due to increased dollar
outflows to cover oil import bills and other foreign-exchange
obligations,” Kunle Ezun, a Lagos-based analyst at Ecobank
Transnational Inc., said by phone today.  Traders are also increasing dollar demand before next
month’s Easter celebrations, Tunde Ladipo, chief executive
officer of Lagos-based Valuechain Investment Ltd., said.  Africa’s most populous country of more than 160 million
people, with Muslims and Christians almost at par, imports
higher levels of  consumer goods  during religious festivities.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $200 million at a foreign-
currency auction today to stabilize the naira, compared with
$150 million at the previous sale on Feb. 25, it said in an e-
mailed statement. The regulator held the benchmark  interest rate 
at a record high 12 percent for an eighth straight time on Jan.
21. The nation’s inflation rate fell to 9 percent in January
from 12 percent in December, the statistics bureau said Feb. 18.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose six basis points to 10.55 percent, according
to yesterday’s data compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 fell six basis points to 4.45 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.9155 per dollar
in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
