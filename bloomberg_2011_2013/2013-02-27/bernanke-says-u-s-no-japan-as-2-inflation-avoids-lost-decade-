Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. doesn’t face a “lost decade” like
Japan’s because policy makers have helped the world’s largest
economy avoid the deflation that has plagued the No. 3 nation.  “Very importantly, the Federal Reserve has kept inflation
close to 2 percent and we have avoided deflation which was the
major problem for the Japanese,” Bernanke said today in
response to questions from members of the House Financial
Services Committee in Washington.  He added that there are “important differences” between
the nations. “Japan has even a more rapidly aging society than
we do. Their  workforce is actually declining . They’ve had more
difficulties with their banking sector. We were more rapid at
getting our banks up and running again.”  The Fed chairman, who offered Japan a prescription for
ending deflation as a Fed board member a decade ago, also said
the  Bank of Japan (8301)  wasn’t aggressive enough.  “They were too cautious,” Bernanke told lawmakers. “One
of the most salient facts about Japan is they’ve had deflation,
falling prices now for quite a few years. And that’s suggestive
of a monetary policy which is not achieving  price stability .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
