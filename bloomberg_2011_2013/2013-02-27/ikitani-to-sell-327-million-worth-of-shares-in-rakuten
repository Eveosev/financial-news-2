Rakuten Inc. (4755)  President Hiroshi Mikitani and his wife Haruko, who own 43 percent of  Japan ’s
biggest online retailer, plan to sell 36 million shares worth
$328 million at yesterday’s price.  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd. was hired to make the
transaction, according to a filing with Japan’s Finance Ministry
yesterday. The contract with the bank runs from Feb. 21 to Dec.
27, according to the filing, which didn’t say why the shares
would be sold. A  company  spokeswoman declined to comment on the
filing.  Rakuten had surged 24 percent in 2013 before today, the
fourth best performer on the 60-member  MSCI World Retail Index (MXWO0RT) 
during the period, giving it a market value of 1.1 trillion yen
($12 billion). Mikitani is the largest stockholder with a 32.5
percent stake. He holds the  shares  directly and through his
Tokyo-based consulting company Crimson Group. Haruko Mikitani
owns about 11 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The online retailer and Internet mall operator dropped 4.1
percent to 801 yen, the lowest in a month, as of the close in
Tokyo trading today.  Mikitani is Japan’s third-richest individual with a net
worth of $5.3 billion, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires
Index . The 36 million shares the couple intend to sell would be
worth about 30 billion yen at yesterday’s closing price.  Japan’s benchmark  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average has  gained  10
percent this year, partly because a depreciating yen has boosted
the value of exporters’ overseas earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
