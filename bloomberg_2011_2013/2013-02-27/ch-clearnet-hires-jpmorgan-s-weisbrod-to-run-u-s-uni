LCH.Clearnet Ltd. named David Weisbrod to head its U.S. unit as the world’s largest interest-
rate-swap clearinghouse looks to expand outside  Europe .  Weisbrod spent 40 years at JPMorgan Chase & Co., LCH said
in an e-mailed statement today. His most recent role at the New
York-based bank was vice-chairman of risk management.  In the past year, the clearinghouse has agreed to sell a
majority stake to  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) , applied for a
license to operate in  Australia  and bought International
Derivatives Clearing Group LLC from Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and
other investors. The London-based company renamed IDCG as
LCH.Clearnet LLC and has made it the base for U.S. expansion.  Chief Executive Officer Ian Axe is hiring as he seeks to
expand Europe’s largest clearinghouse overseas. Led by Axe and
chairman Jacques Aigrain, LCH is introducing new over-the-
counter services, including one for foreign exchange, as
regulators seek to push more trading onto clearinghouses.  LCH’s SwapClear business said clearing revenue rose 36
percent to 59.8 million euros ($78.4 million) in 2012. The
increase was down to new members, existing members moving from
the introductory to the standard tariff and the growth of client
clearing, the firm said on Feb. 15.  In addition to setting up a U.S. unit, Axe is forging a
strategy for Asia and Australia. LCH is in talks to sell a
holding to  Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX) , the operator of Southeast
Asia’s biggest stock market, according to three people familiar
with the negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
