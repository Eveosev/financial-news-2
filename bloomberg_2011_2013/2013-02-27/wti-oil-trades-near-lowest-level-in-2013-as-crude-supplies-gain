West Texas Intermediate traded near
its lowest level this year. The Energy Department will probably
report U.S. crude stockpiles rose to a seven-month high,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  Futures slipped 0.3 percent, erasing an earlier gain. U.S.
crude inventories climbed 2.5 million barrels, or 0.7 percent,
to 378.9 million, a Bloomberg survey indicated. Iranian nuclear
negotiator Saeed Jalili said talks with the U.S. and its
partners will resume next month in Istanbul after discussions on
the country’s atomic program concluded without agreement in
Almaty,  Kazakhstan .  “Price weakness is likely to continue in the short term”
as the U.S. market is “well-supplied,” said  Eugen Weinberg ,
head of commodities research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.  WTI for April delivery was at $92.49, down 13 cents, as of
1:42 p.m. London time in electronic trading on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. The volume of all futures traded was 27
percent below the 100-day average. The contract slid 48 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $92.63 yesterday, the lowest close since Dec.
31. Prices have gained 0.8 percent this year and declined 5.1
percent this month.  Brent for April settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange was up 24 cents at $112.95 a barrel. The volume
of all futures traded was 9.4 percent below the 100-day average
for this time. The European benchmark crude was at a premium of
$20.48 to WTI futures, compared with $20.08 yesterday.  Turning Point  Iran ’s Jalili called the two-day session a “ turning
point ” and said a more realistic and logical proposal was made
to Iran. He didn’t give details. Technical talks will be held in
Istanbul on March 18 and political discussions with the so-
called P5+1 -- the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia
-- will resume in Almaty on April 5, Jalili told reporters.  “The result of the discussions is yet another example in a
series of postponements,” said  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of
commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London.
“Geopolitical tensions with Iran can easily flare up and boost
the  risk premium  embedded in the oil price.”  The Energy Department’s statistics unit is scheduled to
release its inventory report at 10:30 a.m. in Washington. It may
show that gasoline stockpiles declined by  1 million barrels ,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Crude inventories climbed by 904,000 barrels last week to
373.4 million, the highest level since December, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said yesterday.  WTI may rebound after the formation of a technical-reversal
candlestick yesterday known as an “inverted hammer,” according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures also traded below the
lower Bollinger Band for a fourth day before settling higher,
signaling chart support where buy orders may be clustered. This
indicator is around $92.43 a barrel today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
