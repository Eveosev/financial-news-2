Huawei Technologies Co.,  China ’s
largest maker of telecommunications equipement, is targeting a 9
percent increase in revenue this year from its Carrier Network
Business Group.  The unit, which designs and builds networks for mobile-
phone operators and accounted for 73 percent of revenue last
year, is also seeking to achieve a 10 percent annual growth rate
by 2015, said Ryan Ding, head of the division.  The company’s carrier network business had sales of $25.7
billion in 2012, said Ding in an interview at the  Mobile World
Congress  in Barcelona today.  Huawei is expecting an increase in network spending this
year as carriers worldwide build out faster, fourth-generation
networks using a technology called long-term evolution. China,
where  China Mobile Ltd. (941)  will be adding 200,000 4G sites, and
Asia Pacific, where 4G licenses have recently been awarded, will
grow particularly well, Ding said.  “We are quite optimistic for 2013,” Ding said through a
translator. “Investment increases into LTE will also drive an
increase in the whole industry.”  Carriers will spend about $11 billion upgrading their
networks to 4G, compared with $6 billion last year, he said,
adding Huawei is also investing in technology which reduces
energy consumption or lets carriers control their networks from
the cloud.  To contact the reporter on this story:
