Intu Properties Plc, the U.K.â€™s
biggest mall owner, plans to sell shares to finance a 250.5
million-pound ($378 million) shopping center purchase. The stock
fell the most since September.  Intu, formerly known as Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc,
will acquire Midsummer Place Shopping Centre from  Legal &
General Group Plc (LGEN) , according to a statement today. London-based
Intu said it plans to sell as many as 86 million shares to help
finance the transaction.  Retailers are favoring large malls that attract crowds with
global brand names, allowing Intu to attract new stores and
restaurants to its properties last year even as the weak U.K.
economy led to tenant failures. Midsummer Place has 16.6 million
square feet (1.5 million square meters) of shopping space, Intu
said.  Adjusted earnings per share fell to 16.1 pence last year
from 16.5 pence a year earlier. That equaled the average
estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Net rental income
was little changed at 363 million pounds.  Intu dropped as much 3.8 percent in  London  trading, the
 biggest decline  since Sept. 20. The shares were down 2.2 percent
at 335.4 pence at 8:46 a.m. in London. Before today, they had
gained 4.3 percent in six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
