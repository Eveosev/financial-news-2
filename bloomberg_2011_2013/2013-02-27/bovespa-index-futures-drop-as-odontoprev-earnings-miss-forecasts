The  Bovespa index  gained for a
second day as homebuilders rallied amid speculation that
Brazilian policy makers may wait longer before raising record-
low interest rates, benefiting companies that sell on credit.  MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA  led advances on the
BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index, which advanced the most in 12
weeks. Utility  AES Tiete SA (GETI3)  rallied after its fourth-quarter
profit exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  rose 0.6 percent to 57,273.88 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo. Forty-four stocks advanced on the measure
while 25 dropped. The real climbed 0.5 percent to 1.9728 per
dollar.  “The outlook for companies that are linked to domestic
consumption is more positive as the economy is expected to grow
faster this year than it did in 2012,” Fernando Goes, an
analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage Clear Corretora, said in a
telephone interview.  Most swap rates dropped after the Getulio Vargas Foundation
reported that the IGP-M price index of wholesale, consumer and
construction costs rose 0.29 percent this month, compared with
the 0.34 percent median forecast of economists. Policy makers
cut borrowing costs 5.25 percentage points since August 2011 to
7.25 percent to stoke growth forecast by economists surveyed by
Bloomberg to be 3.5 percent this year after a 1 percent
expansion in 2012.  MRV Rally  AES Tiete advanced 2 percent to 20.60 reais. MRV

state of Sao Paulo, slumped 5.9 percent to 11.90 reais after
posting an adjusted net loss of 24.1 million reais in the fourth
quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Results were “very weak” and signal that the company may
breach debt covenants in the first quarter, Banco Santander SA’s
analysts Marcio Prado and Maria Carolina Carneiro wrote in a
research note.  Dental-plan provider  Odontoprev SA (ODPV3)  tumbled 4.1 percent to
9.35 reais. The company posted adjusted net income of 27.1
million reais in the fourth quarter, which compares with an
average estimate of 42.1 million reais among eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Earnings Misses  Seventeen of 27 companies on the Bovespa index that have
already reported fourth-quarter earnings missed analysts’
 forecasts , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Steelmaker  Gerdau SA (GGBR4)  fell 2.4 percent to 16.40 reais,
following metals lower. The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price
Commodity Index lost 0.3 percent.  The Bovespa has dropped 9.5 percent from this year’s high
on Jan. 3 while the  MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC)  of shares in  Brazil ,  Russia ,
 India  and  China  has slid 4.1 percent over the same period.

nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 7.98 billion
