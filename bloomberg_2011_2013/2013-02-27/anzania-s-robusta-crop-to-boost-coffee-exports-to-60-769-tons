Tanzania’s coffee exports through
direct sales, outside of the auction system, may rise to 60,769
metric tons in 2012-13, following a  bumper crop  for robusta.  That compares with 33,305 tons last season, according to
the Tanzania Coffee Board. The nation was  Africa ’s fourth-
biggest exporter of the beans from December 2011 through
November last year, according to the London-based International
Coffee Organization.  “We produced more robusta which is directly sold to
markets,” Primus Kimaryo, director of quality and promotions
for the board, said today by phone from the commercial capital
Dar es Salaam.  Robusta output may climb this season to around 30,000 tons,
up from a 15,000-ton average, because of increased planting and
good weather, Adolph Kumburu, the board’s director general, said
on Feb. 14. The season’s combined output for both arabica and
robusta may rise to more than 65,000 tons from 33,400 tons last
season, he said.  Tanzania, which reaps the crop from April through August,
produces robusta in the western region, known as Kagera, while
arabica is grown in the northern and southern regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
