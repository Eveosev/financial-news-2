General Electric Co. (GE) ’s finance arm
is in the final stage of a regulatory review to determine
whether it needs extra scrutiny because of the risk that its
potential failure would pose to the  U.S. economy .  GE Capital  Corp. “is under consideration for a proposed
determination as a nonbank systemically important financial
institution,” Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE said today in a
filing. “Such a determination would subject GECC to proposed
enhanced supervisory standards.”  The document confirms an October report that GE Capital was
under consideration to be deemed systemically important. GE
included the same language in a third-quarter filing. Other
firms in the final stage of review include insurers American
International Group Inc. and Prudential Financial Inc.  Companies tagged systemically important could see dividends
and buybacks curbed as regulators try to head off a repeat of
the 2008 crisis that almost destroyed the banking system. The
Financial Stability Oversight Council is evaluating which
companies must submit to Federal Reserve supervision.  GE, the maker of jet engines to locomotives, rose 1.1
percent to $23.05 at the  New York  close. The  shares  have surged
24 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
