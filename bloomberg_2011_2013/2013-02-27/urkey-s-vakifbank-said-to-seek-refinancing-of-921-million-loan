Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN)  is
seeking to refinance $921 million of loans at a reduced rate
that will match those paid by two of its domestic rivals.  Turkey ’s third-largest state lender, known as Vakifbank, is
offering to pay interest at 60 basis points more than benchmark
rates for a one-year self-arranged loan, according to two people
with knowledge of the deal. When banks’ fees are included the
so-called all-in margin rises to 100 basis points, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the terms are
private.  Bank of America Corp. is helping coordinate the deal, which
includes euros and dollar portions, the people said. The
financing replace a one-year credit pact maturing April 9 that
paid an all-in margin of 145 basis points more than benchmarks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Vakifbank joins Turkey’s biggest state-owned lender TC
Ziraat Bankasi AS and  Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , a lender part-owned by
Citigroup Inc., in seeking one-year loans priced at 100 basis
points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. Lenders must
commit to the Vakifbank facility by March 27, one of the people
said.  Aslihan Ahiskal, an Istanbul-based spokeswoman for
Vakifbank, did not answer a phone call seeking comment. A Bank
of America spokeswoman in  London  couldn’t immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
