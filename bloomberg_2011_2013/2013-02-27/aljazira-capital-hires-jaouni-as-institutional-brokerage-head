Aljazira Capital Co., the investment
arm of Saudi Arabia’s  Bank Al-Jazira (BJAZ) , hired Samer Al-Jaouni as
head of institutional brokerage and assistant general manager.  Al-Jaouni, previously general manager of Middle East
Financial Brokerage Co. in Dubai, will start at the bank after
regulatory approval, Luay Al-Motawa, head of international
investment business at Aljazira Capital, said today by phone.  Middle East Financial is one of about 50 brokerages that
closed in the  United Arab Emirates  after a real estate crash in
2008 caused Dubai’s benchmark stock index to tumble about 80
percent from its peak. Even as the emirate’s DFM General Index
recovers, leading gains in the Persian Gulf last year,
international and regional banks are betting on Saudi stocks,
with Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley shifting their
regional equities bases to Riyadh from Dubai.  Aljazira Capital is one of about 30 brokerages in  Saudi
Arabia , according to data from the country’s bourse.  To contact the reporters on this story:
