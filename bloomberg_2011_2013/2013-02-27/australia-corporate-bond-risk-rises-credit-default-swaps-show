The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Australia  against non-payment rose to the highest in almost
three weeks, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 1.75 basis
points to 118.75 basis points as of 10:59 a.m. in Sydney,
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The benchmark is set for its
highest close since Feb. 7, paring its decline this month to 0.8
basis point, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell one basis point to 110 basis points
as of 8:49 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge dropped 6.2 basis points since Jan. 31
and 3.4 this year, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index was little changed at 127
basis points as of 9:09 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. The measure has fallen 8.2 basis points in
February, taking its 2013 decline to 32 basis points, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
