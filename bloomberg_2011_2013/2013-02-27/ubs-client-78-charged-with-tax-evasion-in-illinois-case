A 78-year-old client of  UBS AG (UBSN)  was
charged with tax evasion for using a Swiss bank account to hide
income from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.  Peter Troost, the owner of Troost Memorials, which designs
and sells cemetery monuments and gravestones, was charged
yesterday in federal court in  Chicago . Troost transferred income
to his UBS account, evading payment of at least $193,641 in
taxes from 2007 to 2009, according to a charging document known
as a criminal information that typically precedes a guilty plea.  Troost, of Skokie, Illinois, worked with a UBS banker on
the island of  Jersey  and failed to declare his account on his
tax returns, according to a statement by U.S. Attorney  Gary Shapiro . An attorney for Troost, Theodore A. Sinars, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the charges.  Since 2009, at least 85 people have been charged by the
U.S. in a crackdown on offshore tax evasion, including two dozen
offshore bankers, lawyers and advisers. Zurich-based UBS,
Switzerland’s largest bank, avoided prosecution in the U.S. in
2009. It paid $780 million, admitted it fostered tax evasion and
later handed over data on more than 4,800 accounts.  More than 38,000 Americans avoided prosecution by entering
an IRS amnesty program in which they paid back taxes and
penalties while disclosing the banks and bankers who helped them
hide offshore accounts.  The case is U.S. v. Troost, 13-cr-185, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
