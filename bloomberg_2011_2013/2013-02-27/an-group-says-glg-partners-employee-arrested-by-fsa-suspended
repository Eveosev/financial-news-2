Man Group Plc (EMG)  said an employee of
its GLG hedge-fund division was arrested by the U.K. Financial
Services Authority and London police today.  The FSA has told Man Group the investigation is regarding
the person’s “actions as a private individual and not as an
employee of Man or GLG,” the hedge-fund company said in an e-
mailed statement today. The employee has been suspended, Man
Group said, without naming the person.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
