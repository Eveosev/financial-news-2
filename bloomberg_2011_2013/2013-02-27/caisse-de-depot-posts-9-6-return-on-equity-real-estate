Caisse de Depot et Placement du
 Quebec  regained the top spot among Canadian pension-fund
managers as it posted a 9.6 percent investment return last year
with the help of gains in real estate, public and private
equity.  The Caisse recorded C$14.9 billion ($14.5 billion) in
investment income in 2012, and depositors made net contributions
of C$2.3 billion, the Montreal-based fund manager said today in
a statement. Net assets rose to C$176.2 billion as of Dec. 31,
overtaking the C$172.6 billion managed by the Canada Pension
Plan Investment Board.  The results beat the 9.4 percent median return of Canadian
pension funds for 2012, based on a Jan. 29 report by Royal Bank
of Canada’s RBC Investor Services unit. They also exceeded a 9.3
percent return for the Caisse’s benchmark portfolio.  “These results reflect the efforts we’ve made in recent
years, but one thing is certain: we still have more work to
do,” Chief Executive Officer  Michael Sabia  said at a press
conference in  Montreal  today. “We manage the savings of
Quebeckers, of generations of Quebeckers, so we have to have a
perspective that’s 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.”  Income includes C$1.7 billion from a reversal of provisions
on the Caisse’s portfolio of asset-backed term notes, the  money
manager  said. The Caisse, which oversees pensions in the French-
speaking province, wrote down the value of its asset-backed
commercial paper holdings after the market for the securities
seized up in August 2007.  Public and private equity powered gains in 2012, generating
a combined C$8.8 billion in investment income, the Caisse said.
Stock market investments returned 12 percent, compared with 13.6
percent for private equity, 11 percent for “inflation-
sensitive” investments such as real estate and 3.9 percent for
fixed income.  Real Estate  The Caisse had about 37 percent of its assets invested in
publicly traded stocks and 36 percent in fixed income as of Dec.
31. Assets held within Quebec rose to C$47.1 billion at year-end
from C$41.2 billion a year earlier.  Sabia said last month the Caisse wants to increase
investments in assets such as real estate, infrastructure and
private equity to reduce volatility in its returns. The  fund
manager  plans to add C$10 billion to C$12 billion in what it
calls less-liquid investments in the next two years, Sabia said
at the time.  Real estate rose 12 percent in 2012, contributing to an
11.1 percent return for the Caisse’s C$25.5 billion “inflation-
sensitive” portfolio. That portfolio also includes about C$6.3
billion in infrastructure assets such as airports, hospitals and
pipelines, which generated a return of 8.7 percent last year.  Equities, the Caisse’s largest asset class with C$82.3
billion under management, returned 12.2 percent, the pension
manager said. Canadian stocks, a C$22 billion portfolio, rose
6.6 percent, while the C$10.2 billion portfolio of U.S. stocks
returned 14 percent.  Emerging markets  stocks topped all equity
portfolios, returning 16 percent.  Canada ’s benchmark Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index
returned 4 percent last year, trailing the performance of
markets in every developed nation except Spain and  Portugal .  Since Sabia led an overhaul of operations in July 2009, the
Caisse has posted an annualized return of 11 percent, according
to today’s statement. That exceeds the 9.2 percent return of the
Caisse’s benchmark portfolio in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
