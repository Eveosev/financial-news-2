Soybeans dropped for a fourth day as
rising supplies from the harvest in  Brazil , poised to be the
world’s largest grower and exporter this year, boost shipments.  The oilseed for May delivery slipped as much as 0.5 percent
to $14.25 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, before trading
at $14.2925 at 12:20 p.m. Singapore time. Futures are up 1.4
percent this year after a 17 percent advance in 2012.  About 7.36 million metric tons of soybeans and grains are
scheduled for shipment on vessels berthed, arrived, or expected
at Brazil’s major ports as of Feb. 26, researcher SA Commodities
data show. About 28 percent of the nation’s crop has been
harvested, researcher Celeres said in a report Feb. 25.  The decline “has got to do with the Brazilian harvest
coming in,” Joyce Liu, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte, wrote
in an e-mail in response to Bloomberg queries.  Corn for May delivery traded little changed at $6.945 a
bushel. That puts the price of soybeans at 2.05 times the cost
of corn, compared with a 10-year average of 2.43  times . Both
crops compete for acreage.  Wheat for May delivery gained as much as 0.4 percent to
$7.14 a bushel after slumping yesterday to as low as $6.9775,
the cheapest price for the most active contract since June 25.
It last traded at $7.1275.  In the cash market, hard red winter  wheat  in  Kansas City 
was 38 cents a bushel below  corn  yesterday, the cheapest since
May 16, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data
compiled by Bloomberg. Wheat traded at a discount to corn for a
fourth day, compared with an average premium of $1.57 in the
past decade, USDA data show. The two grains can be used
interchangeably in animal feed rations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
