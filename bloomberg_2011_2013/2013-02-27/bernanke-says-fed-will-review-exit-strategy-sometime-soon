Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the central bank will soon conduct of a review of
its strategy for an exit from record monetary easing.  “We haven’t done a new review of the exit strategy yet I
think we will have to do that sometime soon,” Bernanke said in
 Washington  today in response to questions from members of the
House Financial Services Committee.  He said he thought the “basic outline” of the existing
strategy would hold. “The one thing we could do differently is
hold some of the securities a little longer,” he said. “We
could just let them run off.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
