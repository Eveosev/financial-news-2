The  San Francisco 49ers  will trade
quarterback  Alex Smith  to the Kansas City Chiefs, Fox Sports
reported, citing an unidentified person with knowledge of the
deal.  The 49ers will get a second-round pick in the 2013 National
Football League draft and possibly a selection in 2014 for
Smith, according to NFL.com. The trade won’t be official until
March 12, when the new league year begins.  Smith was taken No. 1 overall in the 2005 draft and was the
49ers’ starter before being replaced by Colin Kaepernick this
past season during the team’s run to the Super Bowl, where they
lost to the Baltimore Ravens 34-31.  Smith, 28, had a 6-2-1 record as a starter last season,
completing a career-high 70.2 percent of his passes for 1,737
yards with 13 touchdowns and five interceptions. Over seven NFL
seasons, Smith is 38-36-1 as a starter with a 59.3 percent
completion rate, 81 touchdowns and 63 interceptions.  The Chiefs went 2-14 last season, tied for the worst record
in the NFL. Kansas City has the first pick in April’s draft and
hired former Philadelphia Eagles coach  Andy Reid  in January to
replace Romeo Crennel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
