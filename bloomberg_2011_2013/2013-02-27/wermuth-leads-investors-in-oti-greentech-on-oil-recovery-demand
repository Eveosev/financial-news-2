Wermuth Asset Management GmbHâ€™s
Green Gateway Fund led investors in OTI Greentech Group AG to
help the Swiss provider of oil recovery and waste treatment
services expand in North America,  Russia  and the Middle East.  Green Gateway agreed to invest 7.2 million Swiss francs
($7.7 million) in two phases with the second due later this
year, Wermuth, based in Mainz,  Germany , said in a statement. OTI
raised 4 million Swiss francs from investors with this financing
round, according to the statement.  As nations seek to boost oil output from unconventional
sources such as oil sands to curb imports, demand for
technologies that efficiently recover or recycle the fuel is
increasing, according to Zug-based OTI. The company also cleans
up industrial machinery, tanks and oil spills.  Green Gateway, with 110 million euros ($144 million) in
commitments and a 250 million-euro target, invests in energy and
resource efficiency companies, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
