Jet fuel in New York Harbor
strengthened to the highest level against futures in almost a
month as inventories slumped.  Stockpiles of kerosene and jet fuel on the U.S. East Coast,
the PADD 1 region, slipped 280,000 barrels to 9.31 million in
the week ended Feb. 22, Energy Information Administration data
showed today. That’s the lowest  seasonal level  since 2008 and
almost 9 percent below the five-year average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Jet 54 strengthened  0.5 cent  to a premium of 13.5 cents a
gallon versus heating oil futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 3:38 p.m., the highest level since Jan. 30. The fuel
has  rallied  almost 13 percent this month from a 12-cent premium
at the end of January.  Supplies of the aviation fuel slid for a second week in the
region, even as  East Coast jet fuel imports  gained 19,000
barrels to 32,000 last week, EIA data showed.  The New York-Gulf Coast jet fuel spread widened  2.53 cents 
to 6.93 cents a gallon. The fuel on the Gulf was unchanged at a
premium of 8.5 cents.  Gasoline weakened in New York after inventories increased
amid a climb in East Coast imports. Refineries boosted activity
in the region for the first time in  six weeks .  ‘Increased Imports’  “The region saw a slight build this week off the back of
increased imports,” a CIBC World Markets Inc. report showed.  Stockpiles of motor fuel in the Central Atlantic region,
which includes New York and is known as PADD 1B, grew 153,000
barrels to  33.5 million  barrels last week, EIA data compiled by
Bloomberg showed.  Imports of gasoline rose  48,000 barrels  to 495,000 barrels,
while East Coast refineries processed 968,000 barrels a day of
crude and other feedstock, 3.5 percent higher than the week
earlier, according to EIA data.  Reformulated,  84-octane gasoline  slid 0.13 cent to 2.63
cents a gallon below Nymex futures, the lowest level since Feb.
14, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The  differential  between
motor fuel in New York and the Gulf Coast fell 4.22 cents to
2.72 cents a gallon.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a measure of refining
profitability based on Brent oil in  Europe , retreated $3.21 to
almost $10 a barrel. The same spread on the U.S. Gulf Coast,
based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, slipped
$3.86 to $29.25 a barrel, while the crack for Light Louisiana
Sweet  Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  on the Gulf strengthened
1.25 cents to trade 3.25 cents under futures. Inventories of the
fuel slumped 1.86 million barrels to  75.5 million  last week, the
sixth consecutive weekly decline, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
