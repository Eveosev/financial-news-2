Coach Inc. (COH) , the largest U.S. luxury-
handbag maker, rose after DealReporter said there is speculation
the company may consider a sale.  The  shares  climbed 2.8 percent to $47.82 at the close in
 New York . The New York-based company slid 14 percent this year,
compared with a 6.7 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Consumer Discretionary Index.  Coach is speculated to be exploring a sale, DealReporter
said today, citing two bankers it didn’t name. Andrea Resnick, a
spokeswoman for Coach, said the company doesn’t comment on
speculation or rumors, “particularly unsubstantiated ones.”  “I am not putting too much weight on” takeover
speculation, said Corinna Freedman, an analyst with Wedbush
Securities in New York. “I am not sure who would make sense for
this.”  Coach’s large size limits the number of potential buyers
and its small presence in  Europe  probably precludes interest
from large European luxury companies, she said in an e-mail.
Freedman rates Coach neutral, the equivalent of a hold.  The company’s North American same-store sales have declined
amid economic pressure on consumers and growing competition from
 Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. (KORS)  Coach earlier this month said Victor Luis, head of its international business, would succeed Chief
Executive Officer Lew Frankfort next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
