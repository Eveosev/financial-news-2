Abu Dhabi’s benchmark index rallied
to the highest level in more than three years as investors
bought banking stocks to take advantage of higher dividends.  First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) , which recommended a  cash dividend  of
83 fils per share for 2012, rose 4.2 percent.  Abu Dhabi
Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB)  advanced to the highest level in more than
four years after raising $1.5 billion from a bond sale. The  ADX
General Index (ADSMI)  gained 1.7 percent to 3,056.39, the strongest
close since October 2009.  United Arab Emirates lenders have raised dividends as they
recover from the impact of the global credit crisis which slowed
lending, hit investment banking and led to a surge in loan-loss
charges. Abu Dhabi banks offer an average  dividend yield  of 4
percent, versus 3.3 percent for the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Financial
Index (BGCCFINL)  of the Gulf Cooperation Council’s most-traded stocks.  “The prospects of the banks profits in 2013 are good in
addition to the attractive dividend yield,” said Nabil Farhat,
partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities.  The Abu Dhabi measure was the biggest gainer in the six-
nation GCC today and about  316 million shares  were traded,
compared with a 12-month daily average of 82 million, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Higher Dividends  Abu Dhabi Commercial, the third-biggest U.A.E. lender by
assets, said in January it would pay a 25 percent  cash dividend 
for 2012, up from 20 percent a year earlier. The lender’s
fourth-quarter profit rose 19 percent, beating estimates. The
shares surged 3.3 percent today to 4.03 dirhams, the highest
level since September 2008.  Abu Dhabi Commercial “has a steady and progressive growth
rate,” Hakim Azaiez, the head of investments at GCA Asset
Management in  London , who bid for the bonds, said in an e-mail
yesterday. “The diversification between the commercial and
investment banking give the bank a balanced revenue stream.”  First Gulf, whose 2012 profit grew 12 percent, advanced to
13.7 dirhams, the highest since July 2008. The bank will
probably post the fastest loan growth in the U.A.E. in 2013,
EFG-Hermes Holding SAE said in December.  Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR)  and  Sorouh Real Estate Co. (SOROUH) , Abu
Dhabi’s biggest property developers, rallied 1.3 percent and 2.7
percent. Shareholders of both companies will meet March 3 to
vote on a potential merger after failing to reach quorum at an
extraordinary general meeting on Feb. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
