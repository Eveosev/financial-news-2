Vietnam ’s two-year bond yield fell
by the most in more than a month after interest rates dropped at
a government debt action. The dong was little changed.  The State Treasury sold 2 trillion dong ($96 million) of
two-year notes at 8.30 percent and 3 trillion dong of three-year
securities at 8.53 percent yesterday, according to the Hanoi
Stock Exchange website. Similar-maturity debt was sold at 8.64
percent and 8.65 percent, respectively, at previous auctions on
Feb. 7 and Jan. 29.  “The decline in yields at the government bond action
trimmed yields in the secondary market,” said Pham Tri Hieu, a
fixed-income trader at Military Commercial Joint-Stock Bank in
Hanoi. “Banks are still keen on investing in bonds.”  The two-year yield declined 19 basis points, or 0.19
percentage point, to 8.4 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 29,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest one-day decline since Jan. 15. The three-year
rate dropped 11 basis points to 8.58 percent.  The dong traded at 20,910 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in Hanoi,
compared with 20,905 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, 2011, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
