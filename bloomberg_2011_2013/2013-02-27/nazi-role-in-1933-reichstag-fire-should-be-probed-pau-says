The vice president of  Germany ’s
lower house of parliament, Petra Pau, called for a review into
the 1933 fire that destroyed the Reichstag in Berlin which
helped clear the way for the Nazi rise to power.  A communist Dutchman, Marinus van der Lubbe, was sentenced
to death for treason and arson in 1933 for setting fire to the
parliament building four weeks after  Adolf Hitler  became
chancellor. Historians still debate whether van der Lubbe acted
alone or if the Nazis were involved in the crime.  “The Reichstag fire is a stigma of German history,” Pau,
a member of the Left Party that’s a successor to former East
Germany’s ruling communists, said in a speech in Berlin on Feb.
26. “The Bundestag especially should have a particular interest
in this and push for a clarification.”  The Nazis used the blaze as a pretext to persecute the
opposition and suspend civil rights, saying the fire was the
start of a communist revolution. Pau said the review of the fire
should be undertaken by scientists, such as fire experts, and
historians.  In 2008, a German law overturned the 1933 verdict against
van der Lubbe, saying it may have been “politically
motivated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
