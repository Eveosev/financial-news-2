West  Texas  Sour crude gained to its
strongest level in almost 14 months against benchmark West Texas
Intermediate after a government report showed that U.S.
refineries boosted production.  Refineries operated at 85.1 percent of capacity in the
seven days ended Feb. 22,  up 2.2 percentage points  from the
prior week, according to data released today by the Energy
Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy
Department. The median of nine analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
survey before the report showed an expected increase of 0.2
percentage point.  “Refinery runs were up significantly, definitely more than
the market had thought,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice
president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.  West Texas Sour, a low-density, high-sulfur oil delivered
in Midland, Texas, rose $1.25 a barrel to a discount of $1.50 at
2:04 p.m. New York time, the smallest discount for WTS since
Jan. 3, 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The discount narrowed in the past month as  Sunoco Logistics
Partners LP (SXL)  and  Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  prepare to expand
pipeline capacity from the Permian Basin to Houston, and after
 HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  executives said maintenance at the Navajo,
 New Mexico , refinery is complete.  Light Louisiana Sweet oil weakened 40 cents to a premium of
$20.30 over WTI, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil lost 35 cents a
barrel to trade at a premium of $20.85.  Eugene Island gained 85 cents a barrel to a $19.10 premium
over WTI, and Bonito Sour gained $1 to a $19-a-barrel advantage.  Mars Blend weakened 25 cents to a $16-a-barrel premium over
the U.S. benchmark. Poseidon’s premium was unchanged at $16.60 a
barrel while Southern Green Canyon’s rose 25 cents to $15.65.
 Thunder Horse  was unchanged at $19 above WTI.  In Alberta, Western Canada Select strengthened 25 cents to
a discount of $25 a barrel to WTI and Syncrude strengthened 50
cents, bringing its premium to to $3 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
