Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  gained for the first time in six days as investors
bought the building material because they expect high production
costs to support the price.  Rebar for October delivery rose by as much as 0.9 percent
to 3,992  yuan  ($640) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange, before trading at 3,975 yuan at 9:59 a.m. local time.
The contract closed at 3,956 yuan yesterday, the lowest close
for this contract since Jan. 11.  Iron ore  has surged 75 percent from a near three-year low
in September as China’s growth rebounded from a seven-quarter
slowdown. Iron ore for immediate delivery was unchanged at
$151.90 a ton yesterday, trading near 16-month high, according
to data compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  “Raw material costs will continue to provide certain
support for rebar prices,” Wu Zhili, analyst at Shenhua Futures
Co., said in a report today. “Any news on hurricane or
transport problems in  Australia  is bullish for the  iron ore 
prices.”  Severe Tropical Cyclone Rusty was bearing down on north-
west Australia’s Port Hedland today, the world’s biggest bulk
export terminal.  Still, gains will be limited due to high capacity in the
 steel industry  and expectations that the Chinese government may
announce curbs on the property markets during a legislative
meeting next week, Wu said.  The average spot  price  for rebar fell 0.5 percent to 3,821
yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
