Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  clients are
seeking longer and more comprehensive service contracts worth
more to the company, Chief Turbines Officer Anders Vedel said.  Vestas, the manufacturer that has sold more wind generation
capacity than any other, offers five types of turbine-service
plans of varying length and complexity, said Vedel, a member of
the Aarhus, Denmark-based manufacturer’s executive management.  “Customers are moving from the less complex contracts to
the more complex ones, where they leave more and more to
Vestas,” he said today in a telephone interview. “The length
of the contract is increasing, and also the value.”  Vestas is seeking to broaden income beyond sales to ensure
it has a steadier stream of revenue when purchases of machines
are slack. Service income has grown an average of 33 percent a
year since 2007. The service unit is also more profitable, with
a margin of 17 percent last year compared with a companywide
margin before interest, tax and special items of 0.1 percent.  Earnings from services rose 26 percent to 886 million euros
($1.2 billion) last year. Vestas forecasts revenue of 1 billion
euros this year, compared with total sales of 5.5 billion euros.  “We have a strategy to have two legs for Vestas to stand
on; turbine sales and the service business,” Vedel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
