Palm oil  climbed for the first time
in six days on speculation that stockpiles in Malaysia may drop
from a near record as  India , the world’s biggest importer,
boosts purchases to an all-time high this year.  The contract for May delivery advanced as much as 0.8
percent to 2,439 ringgit ($787) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, before trading at 2,434 ringgit at 12:17
p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures lost 5.7 percent in the five
sessions through yesterday, erasing this year’s gains.  India’s cooking oil purchases in the year through October
are set to exceed the 9.98 million tons it bought in 2011-2012
as demand outstrips supply, according to Atul Chaturvedi, chief
executive officer of Adani Wilmar Ltd., the country’s second-
biggest importer. Demand will expand 6 percent to 17.5 million
tons this year, said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the the
Solvent Extractors’ Association of India.  “Production is expected to drop in Malaysia, so there is a
good chance we will see some draw-down in stockpiles, and any
demand from India will be another plus point,” Chung Yang Ker,
an analyst with Phillip Futures Pte, said by phone from
 Singapore . “Futures were a bit oversold after five consecutive
sessions of decline and we can see some bargain hunting.”  Stockpiles in Malaysia were 2.58 million tons in January,
near the record 2.63 million tons in December, according to the
nation’s palm oil board said. While  production  fell 10 percent,
it was still 24 percent higher than the same month last year.  Soybean oil  for May delivery was little changed at 49.38
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Its  premium  to palm
oil narrowed to $305.64 a ton today from $307.95 yesterday. They
are the most consumed oils. Soybeans for May delivery dropped
0.4 percent to $14.2675 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September rose 0.3 percent
to 6,722  yuan  ($1,079) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month was little changed at
8,306 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
