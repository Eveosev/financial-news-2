MetLife Inc. (MET)  said a unit won a $190
million tax case in a Tokyo court and was required to send part
of the refund to  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , which
previously owned the business.  The American Life Insurance Co., acquired from AIG in 2010,
won the award, including interest and penalties, and had
collected $160 million, New York-based MetLife said yesterday in
a regulatory filing outlining the company’s condition at the end
of 2012.  MetLife is “required to remit the refund to AIG net of
certain amounts it can retain as a counter claim,” according to
the filing, which didn’t state the size of the refund.  Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian is focusing on
international expansion to boost profits at MetLife. His company
acquired Alico from AIG in 2010 for about $16 billion to expand
beyond the U.S. AIG sold the unit, which had operations in more
than 50 countries, to help repay a U.S. bailout.  The tax case stemmed from “unrealized foreign exchange
losses on certain securities held by American Life prior to the
Alico acquisition,” MetLife said in the filing.  MetLife will record a $30 million charge tied to the refund
in the current quarter, according to the filing. The insurer
will also incur charges of $60 million to $85 million related to
exiting banking, after costs of $163 million last year tied to
the move, the filing shows.  Banking Exit  Kandarian retreated from banking to limit oversight from
the Federal Reserve, which blocked MetLife from raising its
dividend or buying back shares in a review of how the largest
U.S. lenders would fare in a financial crisis. MetLife reached
deals to sell deposits to General Electric Co., mortgage
servicing rights to JPMorgan Chase & Co., and a reverse-mortgage
portfolio to Nationstar Mortgage LLC as part of the exit.  In servicing, MetLife sold net assets of $608 million for
$580 million of consideration, it said in the filing. The
insurer received $190 million last year and most of the
remaining amount in January, according to the filing. Chris Breslin, a MetLife spokesman, said the sums include both forward
and reverse mortgages, and declined to comment further.  Jon Diat, a spokesman for New York-based AIG, declined to
comment on payments related to Alico.  MetLife climbed 2.4 percent yesterday to $35.70 in  New York 
trading. AIG advanced 0.2 percent to $37.77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
