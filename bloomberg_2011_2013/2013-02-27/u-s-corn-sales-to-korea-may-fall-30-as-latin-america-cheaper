South Korea ,  Asia ’s second-biggest
corn buyer, may reduce imports from the U.S. for a third year as
it increases cheaper purchases from  South America , the largest
local feed miller said.  Shipments including feed and food may fall below 2 million
metric tons, from 2.84 million tons in 2012, Lee Tae Woong, a
general manager at  Nonghyup Feed Inc. , said in an interview in
Seoul on Feb. 26. Last year’s imports were the smallest amount
since 2005, Korean customs data show.  Brazil, Argentina and Ukraine are taking market share from
the U.S. in the three biggest importers --  Japan ,  Mexico  and
Korea -- after drought in the American grain belt pushed prices
in  Chicago  to a record last year. The Latin American nations
will increase output by 5.9 percent to a record this year, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said Feb. 8.  “South America is producing more, while the availability
of U.S. supply is tight,” Lee said. “Unless the U.S. crop gets
significantly cheaper, or even at the same price, it’s hard to
choose it now.”  U.S. corn is about $30 per ton more expensive than the
South American grain on a cost and freight basis, with the gap
likely to remain until the next crop is brought to market later
this year, he said.  Corn futures for May delivery were little changed at $6.95
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 4:24 p.m. in  Seoul .
The price remains has declined 0.5 percent this year after
climbing 8 percent in 2012, the fourth straight yearly advance.  Quality Boost  U.S. corn supply accounted for 35 percent of Korean imports
in 2012, the lowest since 2005 and down from 78 percent in 2011
and 85 percent in 2010, customs data show.  “The quality of South American corn has also improved,”
Lee said.  Nonghyup’s purchases will drop to less than 500,000 tons
this year from about 1 million tons in 2012, with the company’s
total corn imports to be largely unchanged around 2 million tons,
he said.  Korean buyers will continue to switch to South American
purchases of corn, Kim Chi Young, a director at the  Korea  Feed
Association said in an interview on Feb. 1.  Nonghyup plans to increase purchases through private
negotiations with some suppliers to half its grain needs
starting this year in an effort to cut costs, Lee said. The
company has traditionally bought most of its grain via public
tenders.  In Japan, U.S. corn imports fell to 11.1 million tons in
2012, representing 74 percent of total purchases, data from
Japan’s agriculture ministry show. Japan’s total corn imports
dropped to 14.9 million tons last year, the lowest since 1986,
according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
