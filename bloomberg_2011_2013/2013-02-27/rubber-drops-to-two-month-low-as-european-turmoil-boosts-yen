Rubber fell for a seventh day and
reached the lowest level since December amid concern that
European turmoil may slow the global recovery and boost  Japan ’s
currency as a haven, cutting the appeal of yen-based contracts.  The contract for delivery in August on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange declined as much as 1.7 percent to 284.8 yen a kilogram
($3,103 a metric ton), the lowest level since Dec. 21. Futures
traded at 287.3 yen at 12:19 p.m. in Tokyo, expanding losses
this year to 5 percent.  The yen climbed 0.2 percent to 91.80 per dollar,
strengthening from 94.77 reached Feb. 25, the weakest level in
almost three years. Italy will sell bonds today after the
nation’s inconclusive elections sparked the biggest advance in
sovereign yields in 14 months, raising concerns the region’s
debt-crisis may return.  “Optimism about global recovery is receding, sapping
investor appetite for rubber,” Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at
broker ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Inventories in China, the world’s largest consumer,
monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose by 2,401 tons to
102,416 tons last week, the highest level since March 2010,
according to data from the bourse.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 1 percent to 24,400  yuan  ($3,918) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board declined 1.6 percent to 89.70 baht ($3.01)
a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
