FIFA , soccerâ€™s global governing
body, gave worldwide bans to 74 people suspended by the Italian
and South Korean federations for match-fixing and corruption.  The punishment affects 70 players and officials prevented
from taking part in soccer-related activity in Italy and four
others banned in  South Korea , FIFA today said in a statement.  The Italian Football Federation issued 123 sanctions,
ranging from one month to lifetime bans, over match-fixing in
2012, with those yet to expire or annulled on appeal having been
extended worldwide.  In addition, four players receiving lifetime suspensions
from the Korean Football Federation last year had those extended
globally by FIFA.  Two days ago, FIFA gave similar worldwide bans to 58 people
as part of an investigation into match-fixing in  China .  Earlier this month, the Europol police agency said a
Singapore-based operation tried to fix games across Europe,
including  World Cup  and European Championship qualifiers, to
generate more than 8 million euros ($10.6 million) in profit. An
18-month investigation, Operation VETO, found 425 match
officials, club executives, players and criminals in 15
countries worked to cheat in more than 380 matches, with another
300 targeted in other regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
