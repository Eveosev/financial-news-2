An artificial pancreas device can
help control the level of blood-sugar in young diabetics at
night, when the most severe declines tend to occur, better than
a standard method, a study shows.  As many as 56 patients 10 to 18 years old and suffering
from type 1 diabetes were tested with the MD-Logic artificial
pancreas made by researchers and, on alternate nights, an
insulin pump linked to a glucose sensor. There were 7 events of
night-time hypoglycemia as defined by European guidelines with
the experimental device and 22 with the pump, according to the
study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Sanofi (SAN) , maker of the insulin Lantus, helped fund the
research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
