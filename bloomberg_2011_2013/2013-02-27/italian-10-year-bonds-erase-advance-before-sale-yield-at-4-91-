Italian 10-year bonds erased their
advance as the nation prepared to sell as much as 4 billion
euros of new 10-year securities and 2.5 billion euros of five-
year notes.  Ten-year yields were little changed at 4.91 percent as of
9:41 a.m. London time, after dropping as much as six basis
points to 4.84 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
