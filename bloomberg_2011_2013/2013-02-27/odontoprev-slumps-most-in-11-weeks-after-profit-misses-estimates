Odontoprev SA (ODPV3) , a Brazilian dental
benefits company, fell the most in 11 weeks after reporting
fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  Shares dropped 4.8 percent to 9.28 reais at 3:17 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, the biggest one-day slump since Dec. 13. It was the
main decliner in the Bovespa’s small-cap  index , which gained 0.2
percent. Trading volume on the stock was 4.9 times the daily
average over the past three months, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Odontoprev’s adjusted net income was 27.1 million reais
($13.7 million) in the fourth quarter, data compiled by
Bloomberg after the company released results yesterday shows.
The average estimate of eight analysts was 42.1 million reais.  “As the cost-related miss seems structural, the fourth
quarter could have more serious implications for future years,
potentially driving strong downward revisions,” Banco BTG
Pactual SA’s analysts Joao Carlos Santos and Pedro Montenegro
wrote in a research note to clients today, calling the results
“dismal.”  Santos and Montenegro reiterated their sell rating on the
stock. Josh Milberg, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, cut
Odontoprev to sell from hold and reduced the target price 26
percent to 8.5 reais today.  The Barueri, Brazil-based company’s shares have dropped 18
percent since reaching this year’s  high  on Jan. 7, while the
Bovespa benchmark index has fallen 7.9 percent in the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
