PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s largest utility,
rose the most in almost nine months as Citigroup Inc. and Bank
Zachodni WBK SA recommended buying its shares, saying investors’
concern about a possible dividend cut was overdone.  The  stock  rallied as much as 4 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since June 2012, and traded 3.4 percent higher at
16.37 zloty as of 12:21 p.m. in Warsaw. PGE shares slumped to a
record two days ago on speculation the state-controlled company
will cut a dividend after an asset writedown.  Citigroup increased its recommendation to buy from neutral
and lifted its share-price estimate to 17.6 zloty from 17.4
zloty, it said in a note today. Zachodni raised its rating to
buy from sell, while keeping its price projection at 18.3 zloty.  “We believe the company could be revising its long-term
strategy and expect cuts in investment program due to lower
electricity prices,” said Piotr Zielonka, a Warsaw-based
analyst at Citigroup. “Having in mind the already strong
balance sheet, any cuts in capex would result in higher
dividends.”  Polish baseload electricity for next year has dropped 16
percent in 2012, the most among any country in the European
Union, and lost a further 7.7 percent this year as declining
consumption eroded profit margins. The nation’s 2012 power
demand declined for the first time in three years, according to
the country’s transmission grid.  PGE wrote down the value of its Dolna Odra coal-fired power
plant by 1.49 billion zloty ($468 million), the Warsaw-based
company said in a regulatory filing on Feb. 19. That will lower
its 2012 net income by 1.21 billion zloty and earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 1.52 billion
zloty, it said.  The stock’s slump after the writedown announcement was an
“overreaction,”  Pawel Puchalski , an analyst at Zachodni in
Warsaw, said in a note today. PGE “stands out as an ideal
overweight versus its European peers and we would advise cashing
in 2013 dividend.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
