Global grain and oilseed costs will
moderate on increased production after drought in the U.S.
slashed yields and boosted prices, Agriculture & Agri-Foods
Canada said today.  “The 2012 U.S. drought dramatically reduced yields and had
a significant price impact on world grains and oilseeds,” the
government agency said in an e-mailed  report . “The outlook
anticipates a strong global supply response, which will reduce
prices in the short term. Although prices will moderate, the
medium-term outlook is for commodity prices to remain on a
higher price plateau.”  The worst drought since the 1930s last year sent corn and
soybean prices to a record as U.S. yields declined. Wheat on the
Chicago Board of Trade surged 19 percent in 2012, the biggest
gain among the 24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Spot Index. Canola on ICE Futures Canada in Winnipeg rose
13 percent.  Net cash-income for Canadian farms reached a record C$13.1
billion (US$12.8 billion) in 2012, 14 percent higher than 2011,
the government said in a separate report. The net worth per farm
climbed to C$1.8 million in 2012 and is forecast to reach an
all-time high of C$1.9 million in 2013, Agri-Canada said.  Farm income will continue to be “strong” in 2013 as a
“promising”  South America  spring harvest and a normal fall
crop in the northern hemisphere will increase supplies, the
government said.  Livestock farmers probably had record incomes in 2012 amid
higher cattle prices, Agri-Canada said. Cattle and hog price
will continue to increase, and hog-farm income will rise 25
percent in 2013 as feed costs decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
