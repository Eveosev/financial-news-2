climbing 0.2 percent in January and remaining unchanged in the
last month of 2012, according to the bi-weekly survey of traders
and investors posted on the bank website today. Traders in the
previous survey forecast 0.2 percent inflation this month.  Policy makers since the last survey was published on Feb.

consecutive month, saying in a statement accompanying their
decision that domestic demand had exceeded forecasts and the
labor market was tight. The  key interest rate  will remain
unchanged for six months before rising to 5.25 percent by March
next year, according to today’s poll.  Economic growth as measured by the Imacec index, a proxy

6.6 percent in the year-ago period.  Manufacturing output grew 2.4 percent in 2012 as retail
sales surged 8.8 percent, according to government data. GDP
gains will slow this year, expanding 4.6 percent over 2012,
according to analysts polled by Bloomberg.  Annual inflation will speed up to 3 percent in 12 months
after accelerating to 1.6 percent in January from 1.5 percent in
December, according to today’s survey of 56 traders and
investors. Policy makers target 3 percent inflation, plus or
minus one percentage point over two years.  The peso was largely unchanged at 473.63 per  U.S. dollar  at
