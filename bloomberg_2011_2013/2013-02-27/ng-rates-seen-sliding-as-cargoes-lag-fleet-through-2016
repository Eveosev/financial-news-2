Rates to ship liquefied natural gas
will decline over the next three years as trade fails to keep
pace with the construction of new vessels, according to Lloyd’s
List Intelligence.  Global cargoes would need to increase to 4,800 a year by
2016 from less than 4,000 in order to keep the fleet as busy as
it is now, while vessel capacity expands 25 percent in that time
period, Claire Wright, head of the analyst team at the London-
based consultant, said at the Informa Plc LNG Shipping
Conference today. That won’t happen because there aren’t enough
export facilities being built, she said.  “This gap is going to be one of the big challenges,”
Wright said at the conference in  London . “It’s going to have an
effect on rates and employment.”  Ships on order that haven’t secured contracts will be most
affected, according to Wright. The “mismatch” between supply
and demand will subside after 2018 as new production plants are
finished, she said. The outlook depends on energy policies in
 Japan , the biggest importer, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
