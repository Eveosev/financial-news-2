Litha Healthcare Group Ltd. (LHG) , a South
African drugmaker, rose the most in almost ten months after
saying its considering buying shares back and going private.  Stocks  advanced  as much as 9 percent, the most since May 3,
and traded 7.5 percent higher at 3.60 rand by 11:02 a.m. in
Johannesburg. About 328,000 shares changed hands, more than
three times the daily average over the past three months.  The Johannesburg-based company will probably offer holders
3.90 rand a share following a transaction where a black-owned
company will take a stake in Litha, it said in a statement
yesterday after normal trading hours.  Earnings per share adjusted for one-time items for 2012
will be 60 percent to 80 percent lower from a year earlier,
because of transaction costs related to acquisitions and because
of a weaker rand in the period, the company said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
