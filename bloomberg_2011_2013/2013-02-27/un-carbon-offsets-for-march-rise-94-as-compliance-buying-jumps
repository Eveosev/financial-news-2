United Nations carbon credits for
March jumped the most ever and trading rose to the highest in
more than two months ahead of a deadline to surrender permits
and offsets in the European Union’s carbon market.  March Certified Emission Reduction futures gained as much
as 94 percent to 33 euro cents ($0.43) a metric ton on  London ’s
ICE Futures Europe exchange. That’s the highest price since Dec.
11. ICE Futures handled 5.2 million tons of March offsets, the
busiest day since Dec. 11. The contract closed 82 percent higher
at 31 cents.  March is the latest futures contract in which delivery of
CERs to buyers is guaranteed to take place before factories and
power stations in the EU emissions trading system must surrender
offsets and permits matching their emissions for 2012. Emitters
may surrender a limited number of CERs as part of their
compliance, under EU rules.  “I reckon compliance buyers have decided they may as well
use up their compliance space now with CERs being so cheap,”
says Mark Meyrick, head of the carbon trading unit of Dutch
utility Eneco in Rotterdam.  December CERs rose as much as 14 percent to 40 cents and
closed 2 cents higher at 37 euro cents.  EU permits for December gained as much as 4.4 percent to
4.49 euros a ton and closed 17 cents higher at 4.47 euros. ICE
Futures handled 15 million tons of December allowances, the
lowest volume for that contract since Jan. 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
