Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) , the U.K.’s
largest homebuilder by volume, said first-half profit more than
doubled as the company reduced costs while margins and mortgage
lending improved.  Net income for the six months ended Dec. 31 rose to 33
million pounds ($50 million), or 3.3 pence a share, from 12.1
million pounds, or 1.2 pence, a year earlier, the London-based
company said in a statement today. Revenue was little changed at
951.1 million pounds.  “The foundations of stronger mortgage lending are a lot
firmer than they have been for some time, which is why we are a
little more confident,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Clare said
on a conference call. “Mortgage availability is clearly
improving. We’ve also got the benefit of NewBuy, which is firing
on all cylinders now.”  U.K. house-construction companies are reporting increasing
sales of new homes and higher average prices, resulting in
improved profitability after a slump during the global recession
in 2008. Homebuilders have also widened their margins after
focusing more on houses and developing land acquired at
discounts during the global financial crisis.  Shares Gain  Barratt was down 0.40 penny at 235.1 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London . The shares have gained 66 percent in the 12
months, giving the company a market value of 2.3 billion pounds.  The Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders Index, composed of
Britain’s seven biggest publicly traded house builders, rose 70
percent last year even as mortgage lending remained at less than
half the levels in 2007. The index has risen about 5 percent
this year.  Barratt’s operating margin widened to 8.5 percent from 6.4
percent a year earlier. Completions were little changed at 5,085
homes and the average selling price of its properties rose 2.4
percent to 185,500 pounds.  The company’s net debt was 331.7 million pounds at the end
of 2012 compared with 542.2 million pounds a year earlier.
Barratt expects to be debt-free by June 2016, Clare said on the
call.  The government’s NewBuy program, which helps to reduce the
cost of mortgages for those buying their first home, is helping
Barratt to sell more homes. Around 8 percent of its private
reservations in autumn were aided by the mortgage indemnity
program and Barratt expects the increase to amount to as much as
15 percent in the second half of its fiscal year.  “We will remain cautious as to whether the slow thaw in
the lending market is sustained,” Clare said by telephone. The
company’s fiscal year ends June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
