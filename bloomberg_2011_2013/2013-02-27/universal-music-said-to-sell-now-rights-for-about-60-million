Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s  Universal Music  Group
sold its European rights to the Now! compilation series to Sony
Music Entertainment in the final step of the asset sales
required by regulators to approve its purchase of  EMI Group. (EMIS)   Universal Music didn’t disclose the financial details on
the sale in an e-mailed statement today announcing the deal.  The sale “demonstrates the value we have been able to
unlock through the targeted divestment of quality assets,”
Universal Music Group International Chief Operating Officer Max Hole said in the statement.  The agreement, valued at about 40 million pounds ($60.5
million), is among asset sales required by European regulators
after Universal Music’s acquisition of EMI, according to a
person with knowledge of the transaction before it was made
public.  Universal Music won European Union approval to take over
the recorded-music business of EMI in September after pledging
to sell about a third of the London-based company’s assets to
cut the combined group’s market share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
