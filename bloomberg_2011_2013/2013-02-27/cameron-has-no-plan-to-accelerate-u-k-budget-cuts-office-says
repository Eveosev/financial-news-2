David Cameron’s office said the
government is sticking with its existing plans to reduce the
budget deficit after the prime minister told British lawmakers
that “further and faster” cuts were required.  Cameron was referring to the extension until 2018 of the
budget squeeze announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in December rather than expressing a desire for further
action, according to his office. Cameron made the comment today
as he defended his economic strategy in the wake of Moody’s
Investors Service stripping Britain of its top credit rating
last week.  “This credit rating does matter,” Cameron told lawmakers
in the House of Commons in  London , when asked about the
downgrade. “It demonstrates that we have to go further and
faster on reducing the deficit.”  Osborne said as far back as 2010 that he should be judged
on his ability to protect Britain’s top investment grade as he
mapped out the toughest austerity program since World War II.
Gilts have tumbled this year amid signs government is struggling
to reach its deficit-reduction targets.  Cameron said U.K. borrowing costs are still at record
lows, even after the downgrade.  “While I don’t deny for one second the importance of the
ratings agencies, the most important test, which is one we face
day in, day out at the market, is the rate of interest at which
we borrow,” Cameron said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
