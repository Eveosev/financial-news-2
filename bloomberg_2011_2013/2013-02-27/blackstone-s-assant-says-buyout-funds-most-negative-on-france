Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s head of
European private equity, Lionel Assant, said his industry is
“absolutely negative” about investing in France because the
country is delaying economic reforms.  “It is very difficult to be excited on France these
days,” Assant said at the SuperReturn International conference
in Berlin today. “Structural reforms have not started. The
country is effectively denying the inevitable.”  Assant also said France is viewed as the least promising
economy in the euro region, while perceptions of nations harder-
hit by the  European debt crisis  have improved. French President
Francois Hollande is struggling to boost employment in an
economy teetering on the brink of recession as more than 3
million people look for work, the highest level of joblessness
in 15 years.  “I was sitting at a round table with private-equity
executives a couple of weeks ago,” Assant said. “People were
incredibly optimistic about Ireland, starting to be optimistic
about Spain. There was just one country were there was
consensus: it is France. They were absolutely negative about
France.”  Assant has worked for New York-based Blackstone, the
world’s largest buyout-fund manager, since 2003 and became head
of European private equity last year.  France’s government and industrial competitiveness were
criticized this month by Titan International Inc. Chairman
Maurice Taylor, who exchanged letters with Industry Minister
Arnaud Montebourg after the U.S.-based company declined to
reconsider buying a tire plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
