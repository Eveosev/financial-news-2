Centrica Plc (CNA) , the biggest power and
gas supplier to U.K. homes, boosted 2012 profits by 5.5 percent
as domestic gas demand rose because of cooler weather.  Adjusted earnings rose to 1.4 billion pounds ($2.1 billion)
from 1.33 billion pounds a year earlier, the Windsor, England-
based company said today in a statement. That was in line with
the average average of 1.38 billion pounds estimate by 16
analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “After a warm 2011, cooler weather saw average domestic
gas consumption increase” by 12 percent, the company said in
the statement.  Chief Executive Officer Sam Laidlaw, outlining the
company’s strategy, said the company would make North America a
“more material” part of Centrica’s business, doubling
profitability there within five years. He also rejigged
management, appointing international heads of downstream and
upstream. British Gas chief Phil Bentley will leave the company.  Centrica earlier this month opted out of a plan to build
nuclear reactors at two power plants in the U.K. with
Electricite de France SA, writing off 200 million pounds it
spent on advanced costs. It also completed a 500 million-pound
share buyback program.  The company’s British Gas unit made a profit of 1.09
billion pounds versus 1 billion pounds a year earlier, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
