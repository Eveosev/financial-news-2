Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank has the “tools” necessary to
scale back record stimulus and avert a rise in inflation
expectations, in congressional testimony that was identical to
his remarks yesterday to the Senate Banking Committee.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  “remains confident that
it has the tools necessary to tighten monetary policy when the
time comes to do so,” Bernanke said today in the text of
comments to the House Financial Services Committee in
Washington.  Bernanke and his FOMC colleagues are debating whether to
curtail $85 billion in monthly bond-buying amid concern the
Fed’s record $3.1 trillion balance sheet may encourage excessive
risk-taking by investors and complicate the Fed’s exit from
easing. Several participants at the Jan. 29-30 meeting said the
Fed should be prepared to vary the pace of purchases as the
economic outlook changes, according to minutes released last
week.  “Highly accommodative monetary policy has several
potential costs and risks, which the committee is monitoring
closely,” Bernanke said in his prepared remarks. “Inflation is
currently subdued, and inflation expectations appear well
anchored; neither the FOMC nor private forecasters are
projecting the development of significant inflation pressures.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
