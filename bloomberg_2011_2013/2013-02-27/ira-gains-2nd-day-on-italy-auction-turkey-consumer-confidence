The lira gained for a second day as
a better-than-expected Italian debt auction helped improve
investor sentiment and  consumer confidence  rose in Turkey for a
fourth consecutive month.  The Turkish currency pared its monthly loss after  Italy 
managed to sell the maximum $6.25 billion ($8.5 billion) at a
bond sale today. Turkey’s gauge for consumer confidence rose to
76.7, its highest level since July. Economic confidence in the
euro area increased more than economists forecast in February.
The European Union is Turkey’s biggest trading partner,
accounting for 37.4 percent of its exports.  “Sentiment has improved slightly today,” Thu Lan Nguyen,
a foreign-exchange strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt ,
said in e-mailed comments. “Most emerging-market currencies as
well as the euro are recovering modestly.”  The lira gained 0.1 percent to 1.8044 per dollar by 2:35
p.m. in Istanbul, trimming its monthly retreat to 2.5 percent.
Yields on two-year benchmark notes rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.72 percent.  The euro appreciated 0.4 percent against the  U.S. dollar ,
strengthening for the first time in six days.  “We had a better-than-expected Italian bond auction as
well as a stronger-than-expected improvement of the Economic
Sentiment Indicator for the  euro zone ,” Nguyen said.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment rose to 91.1
from a revised 89.5 in January, the European Commission in
Brussels said.  The Treasury in  Rome  sold 4 billion euros of a new 10-year
bond due 2023 at 4.83 percent, up from 4.17 percent at an
auction of similar-maturity debt on Jan. 30 and the highest
since Oct. 30. It also sold 2.5 billion euros of bonds due in
2017 at 3.59 percent compared with 2.94 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
