Italy’s  government bonds  rose,
pushing 10-year yields down from the highest level in three
months, after demand increased at the nation’s first debt
auction since inconclusive election results.  Benchmark  securities  trimmed their first monthly decline
since July as the Rome-based Treasury sold 6.5 billion euros
($8.51 billion) of five- and 10-year bonds, matching its target.
Spanish and Portuguese bonds also gained as a euro-area report
showed economic confidence increased in February, adding to
optimism the debt crisis can be contained. German bunds were
little changed after 10-year yields dropped to the lowest level
in eight weeks.  “The auction has cleared with strong demand and better-
than-expected yield levels,” said Owen Callan, an analyst at
 Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Dublin. There is “very strong demand for the
10 year in particular, which is encouraging. It shows that fears
of a rapid disintegration of investor sentiment toward  Italy  may
be overstated.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 4.80 percent at 5 p.m.  London  time after
rising to 4.96 percent, the highest level since Nov. 15. The 5.5
percent bond due November 2022 gained 0.655, or 6.55 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 105.705.  The yield jumped as much as 44 basis points yesterday, the
biggest increase since Dec. 19, 2011, and has climbed 50 basis
points this month.  Demand Increases  Investors bid for 1.65 times the 4 billion euros of new 10-
year bonds that Italy sold, up from 1.32 times at the previous
auction of the maturity on Jan. 30. The so-called bid-to-cover
ratio for the five-year notes was 1.61, versus 1.3 last month.
The 10-year securities were sold at an average yield of 4.83
percent, compared with 4.17 percent in January.  The auction came as European Union leaders put pressure on
Italy’s political parties to form a unity government committed
to budget rigor. EU Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn
said it is “important to get a functioning government.”  Silvio Berlusconi , a three-time prime minister ousted in
November 2011 during an escalation of the debt crisis, gained a
blocking minority in the upper house in the elections. The
billionaire’s re-emergence and rise of former comedian Beppe Grillo risked plunging Italy into weeks of paralysis.  Grillo said today that lawmakers from his 5 Star Movement
won’t vote confidence in any government.  ‘Really Unclear’  “Things are really unclear with regard to the election
results and it’s difficult to pin down what’s going to happen,”
said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “It won’t take much for
the market to sell Italian bonds more, and if the prospect of a
second vote becomes greater then that will probably happen. The
longer it drags on for the greater the risks will be.”  The bonds of so-called peripheral nations rallied as the
European Commission said its index of euro-area  executive and
consumer sentiment  improved to 91.1 this month from a revised
89.5 in January. Economists forecast an increase to 89.9,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Spanish 10-year yields fell 13 basis points to 5.23 percent
after jumping 20 basis points yesterday.  Portugal ’s 10-year rate
declined seven basis points to 6.49 percent.  Germany ’s 10-year yield closed at 1.45 percent after
dropping to 1.42 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 2.  Italian government bonds returned a loss of 1.3 percent
this year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German debt slid 0.5 percent, while Spanish
securities gained 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
