A shark killed a man swimming off a
beach in  New Zealand  in the second fatal attack in the nation in
four years, prompting police to shoot at the animal from rubber
dinghies as it mauled his corpse.  The man, aged in his 40s, was swimming about 200 meters
(650 feet) off Muriwai Beach on the west coast of the  North
Island  when he was attacked by a four-meter shark at about 1:30
p.m. local time today,  New Zealand Police  said in a  statement .  “Police and surf life savers went out in two inflatable
rubber dinghies and fired on the shark,” Inspector Shawn Rutene
said. “It rolled over and disappeared.”  There have been 44  recorded unprovoked shark attacks  in New
Zealand since 1852, according to Te Ara: the Encyclopedia of New
Zealand.  Great White Sharks  have been responsible for most of
the 11 fatal attacks where the shark has been identified. The
last deadly incident was in 2009, when a swimmer was killed at
Clark Island, according to  Shark Attack File Info.   “We have an eyewitness that said there were possibly two
sharks that were there,” Rutene said in a televised news 
conference  at the beach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
