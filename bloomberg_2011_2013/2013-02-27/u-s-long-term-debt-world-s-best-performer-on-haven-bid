Treasuries erased gains before
Treasury auctions $29 billion of seven-year notes, the last of
three sales this week totaling $99 billion.  U.S. debt  rose earlier today, extending their first monthly
gain since November, as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
reduced concern the central bank’s monetary stimulus would spark
inflation. Benchmark 10-year note yields reached an almost one-
month low as Bernanke testified to lawmakers for a second day.
U.S. debt was also supported as Congress-mandated $1.2 trillion
in across-the-board spending cuts are set to begin March 1.  “Bernanke hasn’t changed his viewpoint, and that means
more easing,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist at
BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade
with the Fed. “With the sequestration and all the politics
coming that the market has to deal with, we are likely to see a
continued grind lower in yield. The economy has gotten better,
but there is no evidence yet that the recovery will be self-
sustaining.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  was little changed at 1.88
percent at 12:39 p.m.  New York  time, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 2 percent note due February 2023 traded at
101 2/32.  The yield fell as much as four basis points and it reached
1.84 percent yesterday, the least since Jan. 24. The yield has
dropped 11 basis points since Jan. 31.  Debt Returns  U.S. government debt  returned 0.6 percent in February,
after sliding 1 percent the previous month, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The difference between the yields on two-year and 10-year
notes, the so-called yield curve, narrowed to 1.64 percentage
points, almost the least since Jan. 24. It dropped from a 2013
high of 1.79 percentage points reached on Feb. 4.  The 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, reached
minus 0.74 percent, the most costly level since Jan. 23. A
negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value.  Treasury trading volume was $399 billion yesterday, down
from $401.6 billion on Feb. 25, the highest level since Feb. 1,
according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S.
government debt. Daily volume has averaged $294 billion this
year, compared with $240 billion in 2012.  Fed Policy  The central bank is buying $85 billion of Treasury and
mortgage bonds a month to put downward pressure on interest
rates. The Fed purchased $5 billion of Treasuries maturing from
February 2017 to November 2017 today.  Bernanke’s testimony “reminded people the Fed’s QE program
was not ending anytime soon,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global
strategist at the broker-dealer BTIG LLC in New York. “There’s
a tremendous amount of demand for U.S. Treasuries. I don’t see
any reason today’s auction should be the exception.”  The seven-year notes being sold today yielded 1.26 percent
in pre-auction trading, down from 1.416 percent at the previous
sale of similar-maturity securities on Jan. 30. That compares
with a  record-low  auction yield of 0.954 percent on July 26.  The U.S. sold $35 billion of five-year securities yesterday
and the same amount of two-year debt on Feb. 25.  Treasury 10-year yields will fall to 1.85 percent by the
end of March and then climb to 2.31 percent by Dec. 31, based on
a Bloomberg survey of financial companies with the most recent
projections given the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
