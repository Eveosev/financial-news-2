The Canadian dollar fluctuated
versus its U.S. peer before Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke’s second day of congressional testimony and a report
that may show that U.S. durable goods orders fell in January.  The currency declined to the weakest level since June
yesterday against the greenback after Bernanke defended the
central bank’s asset-buying program, known as quantitative
easing, and said spending cuts set to take effect in two days
would harm the economy of  Canada ’s largest trading partner. The
so-called loonie fell against a majority of its most-traded
peers before a March 1 report forecast to show the world’s
largest economy contracted in December, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 20 economists.  “People are going to be paying attention to Bernanke,”
John Curran, senior vice president at Canadianforex Ltd., an
online foreign-exchange dealer, said by phone in Toronto. “If
he comes out again as being more supportive of quantitative
easing, that will strengthen the Canadian dollar.”  The Canadian dollar, known as the loonie for the image of
the water fowl on the C$1 coin, was little changed at C$1.0264
per U.S. dollar at 8:32 a.m. Toronto time. One loonie buys 97.43
U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
