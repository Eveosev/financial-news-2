Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest
agricultural-equipment maker, raised its quarterly dividend by
11 percent to 51 cents a share from 46 cents previously.  The increase is the 11th since early 2004, the Moline,
Illinois-based company said today in a statement. The boosted
dividend is payable May 1 to holders of record on March 28.  “Our dividend increase reflects our confidence in our
long-term cash flows,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sam
Allen said in the statement. “Deere is well-positioned to
benefit from major trends that we continue to believe hold great
promise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
