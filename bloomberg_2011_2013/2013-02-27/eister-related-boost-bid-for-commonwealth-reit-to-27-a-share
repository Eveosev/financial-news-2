Activist investor Keith Meister and
Related Cos., who together own 9.8 percent of  CommonWealth REIT (CWH) ,
increased their bid for the company to $27 a share as they try
to thwart its plan to issue 27 million shares.  The two investors said yesterday they were prepared to
offer $25 a share for CommonWealth. Earlier, they sued the
company and claimed breach of fiduciary duty, seeking to stop
CommonWealth’s plan to issue the new stock and use $450 million
in proceeds to pay off debt. The new offer is contingent upon
suspension of the share offering and meeting with the two
investors within 48 hours, they said in a statement.
CommonWealth said today that it will proceed with the sale.  Meister’s Corvex Management LP and Related, led by Chief
Executive Officer Jeff Blau, project that CommonWealth’s real
estate assets are worth about $40 a share, according to a
regulatory filing yesterday, and assert that poor management has
driven down the value of the stock. With better management, the
two investors expect CommonWealth could hit a target share price
of more than $50, the filing shows.  “You continue to ignore your largest shareholders’ call
for a cancellation of your proposed equity offering, and you
continue to ignore our proposal to acquire all outstanding
shares for $25 per share,” Meister and Blau said in a letter
sent to the company’s board today. “We are prepared to increase
our proposal to $27 per share.”  The Newton, Massachusetts-based real estate investment
trust said in a previous statement that, “the best interests of
CommonWealth will be served by CommonWealth continuing the
common share offering and debt tender offer previously
announced.”  Prepared Bid  Meister and Related have said their offer could be reduced
if CommonWealth proceeds with the share offering scheduled for
tonight.  Issuing 27 million additional shares will dilute
CommonWealth’s outstanding stock by more than 30 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, lowering the dividends
paid to shareholders. REITs, whose primary income streams are
from real estate, are required by the  Internal Revenue Service 
to distribute at least 90 percent of their taxable earnings to
shareholders in the form of dividends. In exchange they pay
little or no income tax.  Shares of CommonWealth jumped 54 percent yesterday, the
most since at least 1986, after Corvex and Related challenged
the offering. The  stock  today fell almost 8 percent to $22.51 as
of 4 p.m. in  New York .  If the company doesn’t cancel the share offering, Corvex
and Related may try to replace members of the  board , including
CommonWealth President Adam Portnoy and his father, Chairman
Barry Portnoy, according to a regulatory filing yesterday.  The case is Corvex v. CommonWealth REIT, Circuit Court for
