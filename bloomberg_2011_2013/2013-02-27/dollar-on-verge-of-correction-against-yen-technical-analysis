The dollar is on the verge of a
downward correction versus the yen after it failed to surpass
95, Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  The greenback touched 94.77 yen on Feb. 25, the highest
since May 2010, before falling below the base line of its daily
ichimoku chart for the first time in three months. The U.S.
currency traded at 91.88 as of 12:38 p.m. in  Tokyo , compared
with the base line at 91.41 and yesterday’s close at 91.98.  “Should the dollar close below the base line, it’s likely
to drop further,” said  Hiroyuki Tanaka , the chief technical
analyst at Tokyo-based Mizuho, a unit of  Japan ’s third-biggest
financial group by market value. “The dollar may plunge into
the cloud and slide toward a 86-88 range by the end of March”
once it enters a declining trend, he said. The greenback has
been above 86 this year.  The cloud on an ichimoku chart refers to the area between
the first and second leading span lines on the chart and is used
to show an area where buy orders may be clustered. It stretches
between 84.73 and 88.04 today.  Ichimoku analysis is used to predict a currency’s direction
through analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows. In
 technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts of
trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
