Pentair Ltd. (PNR) , a water treatment and
filtration company, rose as much as 3.3 percent in New York
trading, the most in two months, after its board recommended
raising the quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share through the
second quarter of 2014, up from 23 cents a share in the first
and second quarters of this year.  Pentair was formed when Pentair Inc. merged last year with
 Tyco International Ltd. (TYC) â€™s flow-control unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
