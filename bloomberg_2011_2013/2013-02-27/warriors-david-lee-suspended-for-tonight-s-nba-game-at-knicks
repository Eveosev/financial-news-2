Golden State Warriors All-Star
forward David Lee will miss tonight’s game at the  New York
Knicks  while serving a one-game suspension following a shoving
match last night in a game with Indiana’s Roy Hibbert.  Lee, who played for the Knicks from 2005-2010, and Hibbert
both were suspended one game without pay for instigating the
battle that extended into a fan seating area behind the basket.  The Warriors’ Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, and the
Pacers’ Lance Stephenson, were fined $35,000 each for escalating
the altercation, NBA Executive Vice President Stu Jackson said
in an e-mailed release.  Hibbert will serve his suspension tomorrow when the Pacers
host the  Los Angeles Clippers , the NBA said in the release.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
