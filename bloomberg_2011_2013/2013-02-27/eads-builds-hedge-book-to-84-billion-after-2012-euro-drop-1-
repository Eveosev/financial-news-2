European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. (EAD)  said it secured more contracts last year that help it smooth
out swings between the euro and the dollar, the currency of
choice in the global aviation industry.  The parent company of Airbus SAS boosted its hedge book to
$84 billion in 2012 from $75 billion a year earlier, EADS said.
EADS bought $30 billion in new hedges throughout 2012, locking
in an average rate of $1.30 to the euro to protect the future
revenues for its large commercial aircraft, helicopters and
satellites, Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said.  The vast majority of the 588 Airbus planes delivered last
year were paid in dollars, and with more than 50 percent of
costs incurred in euros, EADS needs to buy financial contracts
to protect revenue translated back into euros. Every 10-cent
drop in the value of the dollar against the euro costs the
company about 1 billion euros in pretax profit, EADS has said.  “We’ve taken advantage of a more-favorable U.S. dollar
environment, accelerating our hedging speed in 2012,” Wilhelm
told analysts today on a call, after EADS reported earnings.  The euro gained 0.3 percent to $1.3087 at 12 p.m. in
 Frankfurt  after falling to $1.3018 yesterday, the weakest since
Jan. 7. EADS has based its financial guidance based on the
expectation of $1.35 to the dollar.  Maturing Hedges  EADS has been seeking to increase the number and the
quality of banks that can take the other side of its hedging
transaction to limit risk, Wilhelm said.  “One of the strategic pillars of 2012 was to expand the
number of banks to hedge risks,” Wilhelm told journalists.
“We’re looking for diversification and quality of banks. We
expanded our profile, going East, North and West.”  EADS  has about 40 banks with which it engages in hedging
transaction, Wilhelm said, without providing a comparison for
earlier.  In 2012, hedges of $22.2 billion matured at an average
hedge rate of $1.36 to the euro, Wilhelm said. In 2013, the
average hedge rates will be $1.37 to the euro, declining to
$1.36 billion and $1.35 in the two following years. By 2016,
EADS will benefit from average hedge rates of an estimated $1.32
to the euro after having purchased dollar hedges at more
favorable rates, partly in 2012, the company said.  The expected “exposure,” or amount of dollar sales that
require coverage from hedges, will be about $23.1 billion in
2013. By 2016 it will be about $20.4 billion. The earlier EADS
can move to lock in favorable currency translation rates, the
more secure it can be about future revenues when they are
brought back into the company in euros.  Wilhelm, who is CFO of both EADS and Airbus, said 2013 is
already fully covered, and non-covered dollars for 2014 through
2016 “have been reduced at more attractive rates, which
increase EADS’s resilience to currency fluctuations in the
medium term,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
