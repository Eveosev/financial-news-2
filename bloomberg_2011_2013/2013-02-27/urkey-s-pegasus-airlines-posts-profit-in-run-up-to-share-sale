Turkish discount carrier  Pegasus
Airlines  reported a full-year profit as it prepares for an
initial public offering that will help fund the purchase of 75
single-aisle aircraft from Airbus SAS.  Istanbul-based Pegasus, which serves 39 foreign cities and
24 in  Turkey , posted net income of 126.3 million liras ($70
million) in 2012, versus a 14.1 million-lira year-earlier loss,
according to the IPO prospectus published on its  website .  Pegasus will become the second carrier listed on the
Istanbul stock exchange after  Turkish Airlines (THYAO)  when local
private-equity firm Esas Holding AS cuts its stake. Originally
founded by Irish airline  Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL) , Silkar Investment
and Turkish tourism group  Net Holding AS (NTHOL)  in 1990, the low-cost
operator is looking to add more domestic services and routes to
the  Middle East  and North Africa as demand for travel grows.  “Proceeds from the IPO will be used in part to finance new
aircraft purchases and also to expand the network and strengthen
liquidity,” Pegasus said in the sale prospectus. “The Turkish
market is underpenetrated and offers room for good growth.”  Esas Holding, which owns 96.5 percent of Pegasus, with the
rest held by the family that controls the investment firm, will
sell 32.08 million shares, equating to a 31.4 percent stake, the
prospectus reveals. That should lift the low-cost carrier’s
capital to 102.3 million liras from 75 million liras.  Fleet Plan  Another 3.21 million shares could be made available should
there be sufficient demand, it said. Esas, which bought Pegasus
in 2005, has hired  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Is Yatirim Menkul Degerler
AS (ISMEN)  to run the IPO, people familiar with the matter said Feb. 25.  Pegasus, which currently operates 42 Boeing 737 aircraft
with five more due through 2015, ordered 57 A320neo and 18
A321neo planes from Airbus in December, with an option to buy 25
more for a total list price of $12 billion. Deliveries are
planned from late 2015 through 2022.  The carrier’s passenger count rose 20 percent last year to
13.6 million, or about one-third of the near 39 million total at
Turkish Airlines. Its  load factor , a measure of seat occupancy,
advanced 3.2 points to 78.1 percent in the 12 months.  Pegasus Hava Tasimaciligi AS, as the carrier is known in
Turkey, boosted sales 30 percent to 1.92 billion liras in 2012
and had 1.42 billion liras of debt as of the year’s end,
including 1.24 billion liras of long-term debt for financial
leasing of aircraft. In addition to IPO proceeds it plans to tap
export-credit agencies to fund the Airbus purchase.  Pegasus also owns 49 percent of Air Manas of Kyrgyzstan and
a majority stake in Izmir, Turkey-based IzAir, after selling a
46.8 percent holding to  Air Berlin Plc (AB1)  in September, according
to the prospectus. Esas in turn owns 12 percent of the German
company,  Europe ’s third-biggest discount carrier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
