Taiwan ’s dollar gained for the first
time in four days on signs the island’s economy is improving.
 Government bonds  were steady.  Export orders, an indicator of shipments in the next one to
three months, rose 18 percent in January from a year earlier,
the most in more than two years, official data showed yesterday.
The statistics bureau raised its economic-growth forecast for
2013 to 3.59 percent from 3.53 percent on Feb. 22. Taiwan sold
30-year bonds last week at a yield of 1.795 percent compared
with 1.705 percent at the previous sale on Nov. 20.  “Because of the economic environment in Taiwan,
expectations for GDP are high,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income
trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Insurance companies
require higher yields for long-term bonds. In the fourth
quarter, the central bank may change its policy.”  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.705
against its U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex
Inc. The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 11 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped five basis
points to 5 percent.  Industrial production  expanded 19.17 percent in January
from a year earlier, after a revised 2.05 percent increase the
previous month, a government report today showed. The data for
January and February may be distorted by the Chinese New Year
holidays, which Asian nations celebrated in January in 2012 and
in February this year.  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due March 2023 was
little changed at 1.212 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market, the most since Oct. 3. The  overnight interbank lending
rate  was steady at 0.389 percent, according to Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
