Thai Tap Water Supply (TTW)  Plc plans to
invest 23.8 billion baht ($798 million) over five years,
including expanding to neighboring Myanmar, the Thai-language
Krungthep Turakij said, citing Managing Director Sompodh Sripoom.  Thailandâ€™s largest non-state producer of drinking water,
whose shares have doubled over the past year, is studying
businesses in Myanmar, Laos,  Vietnam  and Indonesia, the report
said. Investments would involve a joint venture or a takeover,
Sompodh was quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
