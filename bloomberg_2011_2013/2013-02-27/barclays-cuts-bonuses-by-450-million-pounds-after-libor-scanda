Barclays Plc (BARC)  plans to impose a 450
million-pound ($682 million) cut in bankers’ compensation to
recoup the fine the British lender paid for manipulating Libor
last year, said a person with knowledge of the situation.  The majority of the reduction will come from the 2012 bonus
pool, with the remainder from earlier share awards, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is
private. London-based Barclays on Feb. 12 announced plans to cut
3,700 jobs and cut annual costs by 1.7 billion pounds after
posting its first full-year loss in two decades.  Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins , who took charge in
August, is seeking to return Britain’s second-biggest lender by
assets to profit and avoid repeating regulatory mis-steps such
as the 290 million-pound Libor-rigging fine that led his
predecessor,  Robert Diamond , to resign. Barclays follows  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc , fined $612 million for manipulating
benchmark  interest rates , which said this month it plans to claw
back three-quarters of the money from bonuses and awards already
paid to employees.  A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment on the bonus
reduction.  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, said
earlier this month it will cut its bonus pool as it sets aside
an additional 1 billion pounds to cover the mis-selling of
payment-protection insurance and other products. Sky News
reported the reduction for Libor earlier today.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Simone Meier  To contact the reporter on this story:
