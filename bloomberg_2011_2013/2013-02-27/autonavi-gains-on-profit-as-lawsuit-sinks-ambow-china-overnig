Chinese stocks traded in  New York 
rose for a second day after  AutoNavi Holdings Ltd. (AMAP)  rallied on
better-than-estimated earnings.  Ambow Education Holding Ltd. (AMBO) 
plunged as investors pursued a lawsuit against the company.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. added 0.8 percent to 93.8
yesterday. AutoNavi, a Chinese digital map content provider,
gained the most in five weeks after fourth-quarter net income
surged 23 percent.  Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD)  rallied as
Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. traded at the biggest premium to its
Hong Kong shares since Jan. 2. Ambow tumbled to a record low as
investors filed a class action against the company.  The China-US gauge followed stocks in  Shanghai  higher as
speculation grew the government will take steps to bolster local
markets and as better-than-estimated U.S. housing data and
rising durable goods orders bolstered confidence in the world’s
largest economy. The 22 companies on the China-US gauge that
reported since mid-January  earned  on average more than double
what analysts forecast, while their results fell below
projections by a mean 8.6 percent three months ago, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We’re going to see earnings grow again after 18 to 24
months of flat earnings, which helps create tailwinds for
Chinese stocks,” Eric Brock, who helps manage $3.8 billion as a
portfolio manager at Clough Capital Partners, said by phone
yesterday from Boston. “The general recovery trend in the
Chinese economy continues, and we look at  China  as being on a
sweet spot now. U.S. data continue to come in strong.”  ETF Advances  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., climbed 0.9 percent to $38.47.
The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rallied 1.3 percent to 1,515.99.  AutoNavi’s American depositary receipts added 2.6 percent
to $10.64, gaining the most since Jan. 22 and trimming its 2013
decline to 6.2 percent.  The provider of Chinese map content to companies from Apple
Inc. to Sina Corp. reported fourth-quarter profit of $8.7
million, according to a statement yesterday from the Beijing-
based company. Net income beat the $6.4 million average estimate
of two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue jumped 26 percent
to $43.6 million. AutoNavi said it expects 2013 revenue to grow
as much as 10 percent to $176 million.  AutoNavi had a total 98 million users of its free mobile
map application by the end of 2012, up from 40 million a year
earlier, it said. Its monthly active users of more than 49
million last year compared with over 20 million in 2011.  Spreadtrum’s Earnings  Spreadtrum, a Shanghai-based mobile chipmaker, surged 5.2
percent to $16.53, the highest close since Feb. 5.  The company said Feb. 26 first-quarter revenue will range
from $180 million to $186 million, beating the $179.9 million
mean estimate of eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Fourth-
quarter adjusted profit of $31.2 million was higher than the
$29.7 million average projection of three analysts and revenue
of $203.1 million also beat the $195.5 million mean estimate.  “Smartphones are driving better than seasonal first
quarter,” Randy Abrams, a Taiwan-based analyst at Credit Suisse
Group AG, who rates Spreadtrum the equivalent of buy, wrote in a
note yesterday. “The stock is reasonable with valuations
remaining low and smartphones ramping up with strength.”  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMI) , a chip
foundry also based in Shanghai, soared 5.9 percent to $2.71, the
steepest rally in three weeks. Its ADRs traded 0.1 percent above
shares in  Hong Kong , the first premium since Feb. 18.  Ambow, a private tutoring company based in Beijing, tumbled
17 percent to $1.30, the lowest close on record. The drop, the
biggest since September, has extended this year’s  loss to 42
percent.  ‘Fake Acquisition’  Ambow was sued by a group of investors including Byron
Brown, who are seeking unspecified damages and legal fees on
behalf of U.S. purchasers of Beijing-based Ambow’s ADRs in
connection with the its initial public offering on Aug. 5, 2010,
according to an amended complaint filed Feb. 19 in federal court
in  Los Angeles .  Ambow, which runs elementary, middle and high schools, as
well as colleges and career centers, wrongly said it had
acquired Changsha Study School in 2008, while it actually paid
“to borrow this school’s name and revenue for the IPO,” the
plaintiffs alleged. Mandy Li, a spokeswoman for Ambow in
Beijing, didn’t immediately respond yesterday to an e-mail
seeking comment on the amended complaint.  Yanzhou Gains  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC) , China’s fourth-largest coal miner,
climbed 3.1 percent to $15.20 yesterday, increasing the most
since Jan. 2. Its ADRs, each representing 10 underlying shares,
traded 2.5 percent above its Hong Kong shares.  The Shandong province-based company’s unit  Yancoal
Australia Ltd. (YAL)  posted net income of A$404.6 million ($414
million) in 2012, from A$301.5 million in the previous year,
Yanzhou Coal said in a filing yesterday.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  advanced 0.4 percent
to 11,144.34, rebounding from a two-month low, while the
Shanghai Composite Index of domestic Chinese shares gained 0.9
percent to 2,313.22, the most in three weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
