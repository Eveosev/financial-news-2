European (SXXP)  stocks were little changed
after yesterday’s selloff, before Italy auctions as much as $5
billion worth of long-term debt today. U.S. futures were also
little changed, while Asian shares fell.  Bouygues SA jumped 5.8 percent after the French builder
reported full-year profit that topped forecasts. Swiss Life
Holding AG surged 5.9 percent after the insurer posted a
narrower-than-estimated loss.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.1 percent to 284.87
at 9:34 a.m. in  London , extending the gauge’s advance this year
to 1.9 percent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures fell less
than 0.1 percent today and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.3
percent.  The Stoxx 600 slid 1.3 percent yesterday after Italy’s
inconclusive parliamentary election sent the country’s borrowing
costs to the highest level in four months, renewing concern that
the euro area’s debt crisis may deepen.  Italy will test markets today as it seeks to sell as much
as 4 billion euros ($5 billion) of a new 10-year bond and 2.5
billion euros of a 5-year benchmark note.  In the U.S., the benchmark S&P 500 Index rose 0.6 percent
amid better-than-estimated housing and  consumer confidence  data
and as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke dismissed
concerns that record easing risks sparking inflation or fueling
asset price bubbles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
