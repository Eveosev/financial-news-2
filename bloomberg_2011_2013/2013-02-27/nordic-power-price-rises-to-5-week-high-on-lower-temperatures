Nordic electricity for next month
rose to the highest in four weeks after carbon and German power
prices climbed.  The March contract rose as much as 1 percent to 39.50 euros
($51.74) a megawatt-hour, the highest since Jan. 23, and traded
at 39.45 euros as of 3:51 p.m. on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy
exchange in Oslo. The benchmark Nordic next-quarter contract
traded 0.6 percent higher at 36.80 euros after advancing as much
as 1 percent to 36.95 euros.  EU carbon permits for December advanced as much as 4.2
percent to 4.48 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London . Emission prices can influence generation
costs at plants fueled by coal and gas.  German power for baseload delivery next quarter gained 0.4
percent to 37.30 euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. Electricity usually flows from the
cheaper area to the more expensive one, which means Nordic
contracts can track movements in  Germany .  High nuclear output and hydropower supply and subdued
demand have kept Nordic power prices “relatively low, and they
have failed to soar, even if January and February are
statistically the coldest months with the highest electricity
use,” Swedish power trading company Telge Kraft AB said today
in an e-mailed report.  Nordic hydropower reservoirs were 44 percent full on Feb.
24, down from 47.4 percent a week earlier, and with an energy
content of 53.4 terawatt-hours, according to  data  from Nord Pool
Spot. That’s more than twice  Denmark ’s annual electricity use.
The region meets more than half of its power demand by running
water through turbines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
