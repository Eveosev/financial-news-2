Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIA) ,  LG
Electronics Inc. (066570)  and a Samsung Electronics Co. unit appealed
their shares of record European Union antitrust fines for
plotting to fix prices of cathode-ray tubes used in TV screens
and computer displays.  The trio, who were among the electronic companies ordered
in December to pay 1.47 billion euros ($1.93 billion), filed
appeals with the EU General Court in Luxembourg, the bloc’s
second-highest tribunal. The appeals were confirmed by officials
in the court’s press service, who aren’t allowed to be quoted by
name, in line with its policy.  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  separately said it
also appealed.  The companies conspired to fix prices amid a slide in sales
of cathode-ray tubes after customers switched to slimmer liquid-
crystal and plasma display sets, EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia said on Dec. 5. Antitrust regulators in the EU,
Japan and South Korea raided companies in 2007 over concerns
they colluded. Philips and  Technicolor SA (TCH) , previously known as
Thomson SA, received objections in the EU probe in 2009.  Philips was fined 313.4 million euros, LG 295.6 million
euros, plus a joint fine for both companies of 391.9 million
euros. Samsung SDI Co. Ltd., an affiliate of Samsung Electronics
Co., lodged an appeal against its 150.8 million-euro fine on
Dec. 14, according to court filings.  Joost Akkermans, a spokesman for Amsterdam-based Philips,
confirmed the appeal at the EU’s second highest court, declining
to comment further. Samsung and LG representatives didn’t
immediately respond to calls or e-mails seeking comment. Toshiba
said in an e-mailed statement that it filed its appeal Feb. 20,
declining to comment further.  Chunghwa Picture Tubes (2475)  Ltd. escaped a fine because it was
the first to inform regulators of  the cartel .  The cases are: T-92/13, Philips v. Commission; T-91/13, LG
Electronics v. Commission; T-104/13, Toshiba v. Commission; T-
84/13, Samsung SDI v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
