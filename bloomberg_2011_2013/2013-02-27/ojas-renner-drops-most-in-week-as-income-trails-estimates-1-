Lojas Renner SA (LREN3) , Brazil’s biggest
clothing retailer, fell the most in a week after reporting
fourth-quarter net income that trailed analysts’ estimates.  Shares dropped 0.5 percent to 75.30 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo , the steepest decline since Feb. 21.
Trading volume was 2.7 times the three-month daily average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark  Bovespa
index (IBOV)  rose 0.6 percent.  Fourth-quarter adjusted net income was 147.7 million reais
($74.9 million), according to data compiled by Bloomberg after
the company filed results yesterday following the market’s
close. The average estimate of nine analysts was 153.2 million
reais. The share of the retailer’s own credit card in sales
dropped to 51.2 percent from 54.2 percent a year earlier.  “The consumer finance operation did not meet our
optimistic estimates,” Itau BBA analysts Juliana Rozenbaum and
Vitor Paschoal said in a research note to clients. The
deteriorating consumer finance numbers might signal a
contraction in profitability while the overall result for the
quarter was “in line with strong estimates,” the analysts
wrote. Renner  shares  are still the equivalent of a buy,
according to Itau.  Renner has advanced 20 percent in the past year. The
Bovespa has lost 12 percent during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
