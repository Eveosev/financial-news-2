Bwin.Party, the gaming company that
has a partnership with  Atlantic City ’s top-grossing casino,
surged to a nine-month high after New Jersey approved Internet
betting and Morgan Stanley said the stock may quadruple
as the U.S. market opens to online gambling.  Bwin.Party rose as much as 15 percent to 158 pence,
leading advancing stocks on the  FTSE All-Share Index. (ASX)  It was
up 13 percent at 11:27 a.m., boosting its market value by about
140 million pounds ($212 million), to 1.25 billion pounds. About
4.2 million shares traded, or 35 percent more than the daily
average in the past three months.  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed legislation
yesterday that opens the door to online gambling in the state in
an effort to help struggling casinos. “This should benefit
industry leaders with proprietary technology, such as  Bwin.Party (BPTY) 
and 888,” analysts at Morgan Stanley led by Vaughan Lewis and
Thomas Allen wrote in a note today.  Bwin.Party has partnership agreements with  Boyd Gaming
Corp. (BYD)  and  MGM Resorts International (MGM) , co-owners of the Borgata
Hotel Casino & Spa, the top producing gaming facility in
Atlantic City.  888 Holdings Plc (888)  has an agreement to provide
technology to  Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR) , the largest operator
in the beachfront resort.  The analysts raised their price prediction on Bwin.Party
shares to 200 pence from 160 pence. 888 Holdings, which gained
as much as 8.3 percent to 162.75 pence, may rise to 175 pence,
they said.  More States  The potential opening of the U.S. market, where states
including Pennsylvania and Florida are among those close to
offering online gambling, could mean that Bwin.Party and 888
shares will more than quadruple, the analysts said.  “The USA is the largest single gambling market in the
world, and we see long-term potential worth up to 460 pence per
share for 888 and 560 pence per share for Bwin.Party,” they
said.  Online gambling in  New Jersey  could be a $1.5 billion
annual business in five years, Dennis Farrell, a casino analyst
at Wells Fargo Securities wrote on Jan. 24.  “Federal efforts for a U.S. online poker bill fell short
in 2012 and we expect legislation to pass on a state by state
basis,” James Ainley, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., wrote in a
note today, upgrading Bwin.Party to neutral from sell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
