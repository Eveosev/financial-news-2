Petur Einarsson, the chief executive
officer of Iceland’s Straumur Investment Bank hf, was barred
from acting as a director of companies in the U.K. for failing
to pay taxes, according to the Insolvency Service.  Einarsson was the director of now-bankrupt London-based
Cbridge Ltd., a company which provided financial advice to the
aviation industry, the  service  said in a Feb. 13 statement on
its website.  He was found to have paid himself more than 100,000 pounds
($152,000) out of the company’s profits to “fund his own
lifestyle but he made no attempt to pay the mounting corporation
taxes owed by the company,” according to the statement. The
company went into voluntary liquidation on June 4, 2010.  “This disqualification sends out a clear message; if you
run a business in a way that is detrimental to your customers or
to your creditors we will target you and remove you from the
business environment,” said Mark Bruce, a chief examiner at the
Insolvency Service, in the statement.  Einarsson said today in a telephone interview that the
ruling is “incredibly harsh and unfounded.”  The executive said he lost more than $1 million in claims
when the company failed and that he only took salary from the
company during the two years in question.  “The person that has lost the most from this was me,”
Einarsson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
