The Dominican Republic water
authority is planning a $160 million drinking water and
wastewater project along the north-south border so residents can
have potable water and sanitation 24 hours a day year-round,
BNamericas said, citing the water agency’s director.  Inapa’s Alberto Holguin said the agency plans to tender the
project in April to improve “access to potable water and
sanitation in the region,” Holguin said at a news conference.
An $85 million water pipeline in Hermanas Mirabal province is
nearing completion, BNamericas also said, citing the director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
