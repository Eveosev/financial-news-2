Hong Kong’s government plans to sell
as much as HK$10 billion ($1.3 billion) of inflation-linked
bonds to local residents, its third such issuance of the debt
since a debut offering in 2011.  “New rounds of quantitative easing in  Europe , the U.S. and
Japan may trigger another round of imported inflation,” John Tsang, Hong Kong’s financial secretary said in his budget speech
to lawmakers today. He said further details for the three-year
notes will be issued later, without being more specific.  Consumer prices may climb 4.5 percent this year, compared
with 4.1 percent in 2012, Tsang said. Inflation reached a peaked
of 7.9 percent in July last year and has since eased to 3
percent. The linkers due July 2014, sold in 2011, traded at
HK$103.2 as of 12:14 p.m. in Hong Kong, down from HK$105.50 on
July 31. The notes paid out interest rates of 6.08 percent, 5.07
percent and 3.38 percent over six-month periods, with the last
installment on Jan. 28.  The city first introduced inflation-linked bonds to help
citizens preserve purchasing power and boost the local debt
market. Hong Kong is due to raise the minimum wage to HK$30 per
hour from HK$28 on May 1.  The inaugural sale of HK$10 billion got orders for HK$13.2
billion, while the second offering for the same amount saw bids
of HK$49.8 billion, according to the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority’s website. Interest payments are based on yields of
similar-maturity floating-rate bonds or the average inflation
rate over the previous six months, whichever is higher, Tsang
said. A fixed rate of 1 percent will be paid if consumer prices
rise less than 1 percent, he said.  Bond Program  Hong Kong’s inflation-linked bonds due June 2015 traded at
HK$105.75, compared with the record HK$107 reached on Aug. 15,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Money printing in developed markets in Europe, the U.S. and
 Japan  has led to a flood of dollars into Asian fixed-income
securities. Hong Kong will double the government’s bond program
to HK$200 billion from HK$100 billion to cater to global
investors’ demand for emerging-market debt and to meet the
criteria of certain global benchmark bond indexes to attract
funds, Tsang said.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke defended the
central bank’s $85 billion monthly bond buying yesterday, saying
purchases are supporting economic expansion with little risk of
inflation or asset-price bubbles. Japan’s yen reached a 33-month
low against the dollar this week on speculation the government
will push for more monetary easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
