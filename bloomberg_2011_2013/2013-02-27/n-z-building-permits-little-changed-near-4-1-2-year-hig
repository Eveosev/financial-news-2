New Zealand  building approvals were
little changed in January, remaining near the highest in more
than 4 1/2 years, amid record-low borrowing costs and increasing
demand in Auckland, the nation’s largest city.  Permits for dwellings fell 0.4 percent to 1,557 in January
from 1,564 in December, which was the highest since May 2008,
Statistics New Zealand said in Wellington. Excluding apartments,
approvals rose 9.6 percent from December.  Increases in planned construction add to signs of a revival
in the  property market . A shortage of properties in Auckland and
rebuilding in Christchurch city and the surrounding Canterbury
district after earthquakes in 2010 and 2011 is stoking demand.
Central bank Governor Graeme Wheeler will probably keep rates
unchanged at 2.5 percent until the fourth quarter, according to
13 of 16 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “Housing market pressures are encouraging stronger house
building demand” in Christchurch and Auckland,  Jane Turner , an
economist at ASB Bank Ltd. in Auckland, said in a note earlier
this week. “We expect demand will continue to lift over 2013 in
light of the more acute housing market pressures in these
regions.”  Economists expected a 2 percent drop, according to the
median of five forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. New
Zealand’s dollar was little changed after the report, buying
82.73 U.S. cents at 10:48 a.m. in Wellington.  New Zealand’s effective home-lending rate in December was
the lowest since records began in 1998, according to the  Reserve
Bank  of New Zealand. The central bank has kept the official cash
rate at 2.5 percent since March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
