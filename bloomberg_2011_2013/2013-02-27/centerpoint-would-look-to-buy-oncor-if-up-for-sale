Centerpoint Energy Inc. (CNP) , a Houston-
based energy distributor, rose to its highest in more than three
months after it said it’s still considering forming a master-
limited partnership.  Shares rose 2.6 percent to $21.23 at the close in New York,
the highest since Nov. 6. The company may still form an MLP to
hold its midstream assets, Centerpoint Chief Executive Officer
David McClanahan said today during a conference call with
analysts.  MLPs don’t pay federal income taxes and have assets that
generate cash flow to make payouts to unit holders.  McClanahan would also consider buying Energy Future
Holdings Corp.’s Oncor Electric Delivery utility unit to boost
earnings, he said.  “It’s all about buying it for a price where you can create
shareholder value and we will look hard at it if it ever comes
on the market,” McClanahan said.  Oncor would be a “nice fit” with the company’s regulated
utility business, which Centerpoint is looking to expand,
McClanahan said.  Energy Future has no plans to sell Oncor, said  Allan Koenig , a spokesman for the company.  Energy Future holds an 80
percent interest in Oncor, a regulated utility that owns power
lines in and around Dallas,  Fort Worth  and Midland, Texas and
delivers electricity to 3 million customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
