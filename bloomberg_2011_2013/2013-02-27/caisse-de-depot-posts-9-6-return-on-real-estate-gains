Caisse de Depot et Placement du
Quebec,  Canada ’s largest pension-fund manager, posted a 9.6
percent investment return last year, led by gains in real estate
and equities.  Net investment income rose to C$14.9 billion ($14.5
billion) from C$5.7 billion in 2011 when the return was 4
percent, the Montreal-based manager said today in a statement.
Net assets rose to C$176.2 billion as of Dec. 31 from C$165.7
billion on June 30.  The results beat the 9.4 percent median return of Canadian
pension funds for 2012, based on a Jan. 29 report by Royal Bank
of Canada’s RBC Investor Services unit. Ontario Municipal
Employees Retirement System, which manages C$60.8 billion, said
Feb. 22 its 2012 return on investments was 10 percent.  The Caisse oversees pensions for retirees in the French-
speaking province of  Quebec . Chief Executive Officer Michael Sabia said last month the Caisse wants to increase investments
in assets such as real estate, infrastructure and private equity
to reduce volatility in its returns.  Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is the country’s
second-biggest public pension manager, with net assets of
C$172.6 billion as of Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
