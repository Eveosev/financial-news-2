Eletropaulo Metropolitana SA,
 Brazil ’s largest electricity distributor, fell to a record after
it reported a fourth-quarter loss that was made worse by higher
power costs.  The  AES Corp. (AES)  unit’s shares slid 4.5 percent to 12.08 reais
at 3:02 p.m. in Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the
lowest since the stock started trading in September 2006. It was
the worst performance on the benchmark Bovespa index, which rose
0.5 percent.  Eletropaulo said in a regulatory filing yesterday the cost
of the power it distributes rose 29 percent to 1.5 billion reais
($758.8 million) in the fourth quarter while losses excluding
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were 14.5 million
reais. The average estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a profit of 92.8 million by the same measure.  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  had estimated Eletropaulo’s Ebitda
would be 133 million reais. Analyst Oswaldo Alcantara Telles Filho said that the higher costs were driven primarily by a lack
of rain that forced the company to buy more expensive power from
thermal plants because less hydropower was available.  “Were it not for this extraordinary effect, the results
would have been nearly in line with our forecasts,” he wrote in
a note to clients published today.  Eletropaulo has declined 28 percent this year, the steepest
drop on the  Brazil Electrical Energy Index (IBOVIEE) , which slid 5.9
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
