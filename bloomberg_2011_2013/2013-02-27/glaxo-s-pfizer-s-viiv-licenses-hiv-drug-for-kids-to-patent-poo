ViiV Healthcare Ltd., a joint
venture of  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  and two other drugmakers, plans
to license pediatric versions of its HIV drug abacavir to a
patent-sharing body backed by the United Nations to improve
children’s access to treatment.  ViiV will grant the voluntary license to the Medicines
Patent Pool for the drug in the 118 countries where 99 percent
of children with HIV live, it said in a statement today.  About 3.4 million children have HIV worldwide, and 72
percent of those in need of treatment don’t have access to
appropriate care because of a lack of affordable medicines,
according to ViiV. ViiV and other drugmakers including  Gilead
Sciences Inc.  also work with generic licensing partners in
countries like India and South Africa to produce low-cost
version of HIV therapies to sell in developing countries.  “This agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool builds on
the existing 13 licenses granted to our generics partners,”
Chief Executive Officer Dominique Limet said in a statement.
“The overarching goal of our efforts is to improve the lives of
children living with HIV.”  ViiV is Glaxo’s joint venture with New York-based  Pfizer
Inc. (PFE)  and Japan’s Shionogi & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
