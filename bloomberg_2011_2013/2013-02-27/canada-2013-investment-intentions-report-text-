The following is the text of
Canada’s 2013 investment intentions report released by
 Statistics Canada .  Public and private organizations and the housing sector
report that their anticipated investment in construction and
machinery and equipment will reach $398.2 billion in 2013, up
1.7% from 2012 in current dollars. This would be the smallest
increase since the economic downturn in 2009.  The main contributor to the slowdown is an anticipated
decline in investment reported by the mining and oil and gas
extraction sector. Declines are also anticipated in the
information and cultural industries as well as in educational
services.  Strong increases in investment were reported in the
utilities sector and in transportation and warehousing.  Of total investment, capital spending by the public sector
is anticipated to rise 5.0% to $88 billion, the second
consecutive increase. Private sector investment is expected to
edge up 0.8% to $310.2 billion.  Of the private sector total, investment on housing is
anticipated to edge up 0.2% to $104.7 billion. If these
intentions are realized, the housing sector will account for
26.3% of total  capital spending  in the economy.  Investment in non-residential construction is expected to
rise 1.4% to $178.9 billion, which corresponds to almost 61% of
total investment, excluding housing. Spending on capital
machinery and equipment is anticipated to increase 3.6% to
$114.6 billion.  Decline in the mining and oil and gas extraction sector  Organizations in the mining and oil and gas extraction
sector reported that investment in construction and machinery
and equipment is expected to fall by $2.2 billion, or 2.7%, to
$79.2 billion. This would be the first decrease since the
economic downturn.  The mining and oil and gas sector is still by far the
largest for capital spending, accounting for more than one
quarter of total investment, excluding housing.  The metal ore mining industry represents much of the
decrease in the sector, as its capital spending is expected to
decline by 32.1% or $3.5 billion.  Provincially, two provinces account for much of the decline
in the mining and oil and gas extraction sector. In Ontario,
capital spending in the sector is expected to decline by $1.2
billion or 30.3%, and in British Columbia by $2.4 billion or
25.8%.  The largest provincial increase for the oil and gas
extraction sector is from Newfoundland and Labrador, where
 capital investment  is expected to rise by $2.1 billion or 82.6%.
Investment in  Alberta  for the oil and gas extraction sector is
expected to remain relatively constant, edging up 0.1%.
Provincially, Alberta remains the largest contributor for this
sector, representing 77.2% of the total investment in the oil
and gas extraction sector.  Other sectors  Strong increases were reported by a number of sectors.
Investment in non-residential construction and machinery and
equipment by utilities is anticipated to reach $31.3 billion, up
7.7% from 2012. The electric power generation and transmission
and distribution industries would account for almost 65% of the
increase. Almost two-thirds (65.1%) of the increase in the
electric power generation and transmission and distribution
industries can be allocated to the province of Ontario, where
capital spending is expected to increase by $943.6 million or
16.7%.  Potential investment reported by the utilities sector
represents nearly two-thirds of the increase in public sector
spending.  Investment in the transportation and warehousing sector is
expected to rise 12.8% to $22.4 billion. Much of this growth
comes from the pipeline transportation industry, which accounts
for almost 40% of the total increase.  Capital outlays by the public administration sector are
anticipated to increase 2.0% to $40.5 billion.  Manufacturers reported an intended increase of 2.4% to
nearly $20.9 billion for 2013. In retail trade, investment is
expected to rise 12.0% as a result of an intended increase in
the general merchandise store sub-sector. Investment in the
finance and insurance sector is also expected to rise by 11.9%.  Capital spending is anticipated to fall by 7.7% for
educational services, and by 3.0% for information and cultural
industries.  Provinces and territories  In 2013, investment in non-residential construction and
machinery and equipment is expected to increase in every
province and territory except  New Brunswick , Saskatchewan,
British Columbia, and the  Northwest Territories .  Provincially, the biggest increase is anticipated in
Ontario, where investment is expected to rise 3.5% to nearly
$80.1 billion.  Investment is anticipated to rise 12.2% in Newfoundland and
Labrador, where the mining and oil and gas sector anticipates a
$1.6 billion increase.  In Alberta, investment intentions in non-residential
construction and machinery and equipment are expected to rise
2.2%, mainly as a result of the transportation and warehousing
as well as the manufacturing sectors.  In New Brunswick, capital spending is anticipated to
decline 6.4% to just over $4.1 billion. Three quarters of the
decline (75.7%) can be attributed to a $209 million drop in
intended investments reported by the utilities sector.  The anticipated 2.7% decline in Saskatchewan is largely
attributed to a $525 million decline in manufacturing.  For more information on private and public investment,

Investment ( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc -
cel?catno=11-626-X2013022&amp;lang=eng) " published today in the
Economic Insights series.  Note to readers  Investment intentions for non-residential construction and
machinery and equipment are based upon a sample survey of 28,000
private and public organizations. This survey was conducted
between October 2012 and late January 2013.  For residential construction, the private and public
investment program uses housing start estimates from the  Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). Housing starts are
forecast under high, medium and low scenarios by the CMHC. These
scenarios are used to estimate new housing investment, a key
component of the overall housing forecast estimates.  The 2013 estimates for housing in this release are based on
the mid-case scenario for each province. The table “Capital
spending in Canada, 2013 intentions, by scenario”, which appears
at the end of this release, covers all three scenarios.  Data in this release are expressed in current dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
