  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , the biggest online
professional-networking service, surged to a record high after
analysts from  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  and Wunderlich Securites
Inc. released bullish reports on the company’s growth prospects.  The  shares  climbed 6.8 percent to a record $168.55 at the
close in New York. Evercore’s Ken Sena raised his price estimate
to $200 from $160 and wrote in a research report today that
LinkedIn could reach $280 within five years. Blake Harper at
Wunderlich initiated coverage with a buy rating and a $195
target price.  LinkedIn has more than tripled since its initial public
offering in May 2011, outperforming Internet companies like
 Facebook Inc. (FB) ,  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  and  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , which are all
trading below their IPO price. While LinkedIn has
characteristics of a consumer Web company -- offering a free
service and selling ads -- it also has an expanding paid
subscription business for corporate customers and premium users.  “The company’s Recruiter product and broader Talent
Solutions platform have become extremely valuable for
recruiters,” Harper wrote in a report today. “We view LinkedIn
with a very large competitive moat around its platform given
strong network effects, a highly visible revenue stream and the
ability to rapidly innovate with new products.”  Paid Subscribers  With its paid subscribers, LinkedIn’s growth more closely
resembles so-called software-as-service providers like
 Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) ,  Workday Inc. (WDAY)  and ServiceNow Inc., Sena
said.  Salesforce, which provides web-based customer relationship
management software, traded at 12 times sales one year after its
2004 IPO, Sena wrote. LinkedIn trades at 10 times sales this
year and seven times revenue for 2014, higher than consumer
Internet companies, according to his analysis.  “While LinkedIn has a large consumer-facing audience
component, its businesses are increasingly akin to software
enterprise providers,” Sena wrote. Those companies have
“sticky subscription revenue streams, vast addressable
markets” and high margins, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
