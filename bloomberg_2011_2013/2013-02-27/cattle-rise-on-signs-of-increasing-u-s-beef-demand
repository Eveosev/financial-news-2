Cattle futures advanced, extending
the longest rally in three months, on signs of increased demand
for U.S. beef. Hog prices fell.  Wholesale  beef  rose 0.8 percent to a four-week high of
$1.8533 a pound as of midday, signaling more demand, said Chad Henderson, an analyst at Prime Agricultural Consulting Inc. in
Brookfield,  Wisconsin . In the past 12 months, beef dropped 6.9
percent and  pork  declined 5 percent, while wholesale  chicken 
breasts climbed 11 percent, government data show.  “The product trade is weaker on both beef and pork, while
chicken is heading higher,” Henderson said in a telephone
interview. “At some point, that can offer some support” for
cattle, he said.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for
April delivery rose 0.4 percent to settle at $1.29875 a pound at
1 p.m. The price climbed for the fourth straight session, the
longest rally since Nov. 23.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement increased 0.1
percent to $1.4755 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for April settlement dropped 0.7 percent to
close at 81 cents a pound in  Chicago . The price has slumped 9.3
percent this month, heading for the biggest decline since July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
