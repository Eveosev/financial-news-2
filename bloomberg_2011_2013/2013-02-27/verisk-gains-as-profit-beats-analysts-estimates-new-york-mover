Verisk Analytics Inc. (VRSK) , the supplier
of actuarial and risk data to lenders and insurers, jumped the
most since October after fourth-quarter earnings beat analysts’
estimates on increased health-care revenue.  Verisk climbed 7.7 percent to  close  at a record-high $58.05
in New York, the top performance in the Russell 1000 Producer
Durables Index. The Jersey City, New Jersey-based firm has
gained 14 percent this year, compared with the 8.7 percent
 advance  of the 138-company index.  Net income increased 22 percent to $98.3 million in the
quarter, up from $80.3 million a year earlier, Verisk said
yesterday in a statement. Operating profit, which excludes some
items, was 63 cents a share, beating the 54-cent average
estimate of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue from the
firm’s health-care unit increased 89 percent to $72.8 million.  “Verisk saw high demand for its payment accuracy fraud
solutions” in its health-care division, William Warmington Jr.,
an analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc., wrote in a note
yesterday. He rates the shares outperform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
