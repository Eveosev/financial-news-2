The risk premium investors demand to
hold  Egypt ’s dollar bonds rose for a sixth day to the highest
level in eight months after the broadest opposition bloc said it
will boycott parliamentary elections in April.  The spread between Egypt’s benchmark dollar-denominated
bonds due April 2020 and U.S. Treasuries widened less than one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 582, the highest since
June 25, at 3:05 p.m. in Cairo, taking the six-day advance to 48
basis points, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The benchmark EGX 30 stock index fell 0.6 percent, with 20
shares retreating. The National Salvation Front also rejected
President Mohamed Mursi’s call for dialogue because the offer
came after he unilaterally set dates for the lower house of
parliament polls.  Separately, the central bank sold $38 million at the second
dollar auction this week, with local banks receiving 22.86
percent, on average, of what they bid for. The pound, which has
weakened to a record this year, was little changed after the
sale at 6.7392 a dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The currency weakened to 7.4 to the dollar in the
unregulated market, state-run Ahram Gate news website reported
today, without saying how it obtained the information.  The political divide, underlined by regular street protests
which have often erupted into violence, has thwarted efforts to
revive the economy, making the government’s bid to negotiate a
$4.8 billion International Monetary Fund loan more urgent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
