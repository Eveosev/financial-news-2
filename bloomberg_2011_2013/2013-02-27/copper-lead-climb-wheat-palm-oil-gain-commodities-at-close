Chairman Ben S. Bernanke defended stimulus measures, raising
demand prospects from the second-largest user.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.8
percent to $7,919 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,

ton, and the May contract on the Comex in New York was little
changed at $3.5825 per pound.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold headed for the worst run of monthly losses since 1997
as a 3.2 percent rally in four days spurred sales and investor
holdings extended their decline on concern that the metal’s 12-
year bull run was coming to an end.  Spot gold fell 0.1 percent to $1,611.55 an ounce at 1:17
p.m. in Singapore, heading for the fifth straight losing month.
The metal reached $1,620.37 yesterday, the highest price since
Feb. 15, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke defended
the central bank’s asset purchases. Holdings in exchange-traded
products have slumped to a five-month low and are set for the

monthly decline. Spot platinum slid 0.2 percent to $1,619.37 an
ounce, and palladium dropped 0.2 percent to $744.50 an ounce.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat advanced for a second day on speculation the grain’s
widest discount to corn in the cash market in nine months may
boost demand in feed rations for pigs, cattle and chickens.  Wheat for May delivery gained as much as 0.5 percent to
$7.145 a bushel after slumping yesterday to as low as $6.9775,

volume that was 19 percent more than the 100-day average for
that time of day.  Corn for May delivery slipped 0.3 percent to $6.9275 a
bushel, while soybeans for May delivery were little changed at
$14.33 a bushel. That puts soybean futures at 2.07 times the
cost of corn, compared with a 10-year average of 2.43 times. The
crops compete for acreage.  Rubber fell for a seventh day and reached the lowest level
since December amid concern that European turmoil may slow the
global recovery and boost Japan’s currency as a haven, cutting
the appeal of yen-based contracts.  The contract for delivery in August on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange declined as much as 1.7 percent to 284.8 yen a kilogram
($3,103 a metric ton), the lowest level since Dec. 21. Futures
traded at 287.3 yen at 12:19 p.m. in Tokyo, expanding losses

speculation that stockpiles in Malaysia may drop from a near

to an all-time high this year.  The contract for May delivery advanced as much as 0.8
percent to 2,439 ringgit ($787) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, before trading at 2,434 ringgit at 12:17
