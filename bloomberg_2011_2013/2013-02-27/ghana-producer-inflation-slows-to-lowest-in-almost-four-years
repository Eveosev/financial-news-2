Producer-price  inflation  in  Ghana 
eased to 11.5 percent in January, the lowest since May 2009, as
growth in mining costs slowed, according to the country’s
statistics agency.  The rate dropped from 17.1 percent in December, Baah
Wadieh, an official with Ghana Statistical Service, told
reporters in Accra, the capital, today. Prices rose 0.2 percent
in the month.  Mining and quarrying costs slowed to 18.4 percent in
January from 26.8 percent a month earlier, he said. The rate for
the manufacturing industry declined to 12.8 percent from 19.3
percent while utilities were 1.2 percent.  Ghana is  Africa ’s second-biggest producer of gold, with
companies including AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. and Gold Fields Ltd.
operating in the West African nation, which also exports cocoa
