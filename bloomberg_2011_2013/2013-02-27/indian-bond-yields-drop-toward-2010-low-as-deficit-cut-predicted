Indian bonds due 2022 rose, pushing
the yield to a 31-month low, on optimism the government will
announce measures this week to reduce its deficit.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, who will present
his annual budget to parliament tomorrow, will seek to cut the
 shortfall  in public finances to 4.8 percent of gross domestic
product the next fiscal year, from an estimated 5.3 percent in
the 12 months through March, according to a Bloomberg survey. A
narrowing of the gap will give the central bank more room to
lower interest  rates  for the second time in 2013, according to
Debendra Kumar Dash, a debt trader at Development Credit Bank.  “Investors are generally bullish on bonds as the macro-
economic outlook seems positive, but are staying cautious before
the budget,” Mumbai-based Dash said.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 declined
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.80 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
matched a level touched on Feb. 25, the lowest level since July
2010.  The Reserve Bank of  India  last cut its  repurchase rate  by
25 basis points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29. The central bank
will offer to purchase as much as 100 billion rupees ($1.9
billion) of government securities at an open-market auction on
March 1, it said in a statement on Feb. 25.  India will probably contain the budget deficit at about 5.3
percent of gross domestic product this fiscal year as it tries
to slow inflation, and economic growth is set to recover,
Finance Ministry advisers said.  “The government is committed to fiscal consolidation,”
they said in a report in New Delhi today, predicting GDP will
rise as much as 6.7 percent in the year through March 2014.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 7.61 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
