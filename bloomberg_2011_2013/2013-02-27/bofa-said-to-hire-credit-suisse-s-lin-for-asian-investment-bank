Bank of America Corp.  hired George
Lin from  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  Group AG as head of  Asia  consumer, retail
and health-care investment banking, two people with knowledge of
the matter said.  Lin, 42, will start working in Hong Kong for the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based bank by the end of June, one of the people
said, asking not to be identified before an internal
announcement.  Paul Scanlon , a Hong Kong-based spokesman for the
U.S. firm, and Credit Suisse spokeswoman Josephine Lee declined
to comment.  Lin is at least the second person to be hired from the
Swiss bank this month as Bank of America seeks to expand its
banking, fixed-income and equities operations in Asia. Olivier Thiriet, who helmed Asia-Pacific cash equities at Zurich-based
Credit Suisse, will join the U.S. bank later this year,
according to a Feb. 22 memo.  Lin left Credit Suisse last week, one of the people said.
He had joined the bank’s  Los Angeles  office 13 years ago from
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., which Credit Suisse bought in
2000 for $13.4 billion, and he moved to  Hong Kong  in 2007, the
person said.  Bank of America last year hired Margaret Ren from BNP
Paribas SA and Stephen Gore from UBS AG to help build its China
banking and Asian mergers advisory businesses. Loh Boon Chye
also joined from Deutsche Bank AG to head Asia global markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
