Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  fell the most in four months as the television broadcaster
unexpectedly posted a record loss for last year.  The stock declined 8.7 percent to 95 koruna by close in
 Prague , its steepest one-day drop since Oct. 31 and the worst
performance in the  PX (PX)  index. Turnover was almost four times the
daily average over the past three months.  CME, as the Bermuda-registered operator of stations in
emerging Europe is known, said its net loss tripled to $546
million as it booked a $522 million non-cash impairment while
clients cut spending on advertisements. The median estimate of
seven analysts polled by Bloomberg was for a $27 million loss.  “We consider the results negative,” Pavel Ryska, an
analyst at J&T Banka AS in Prague, wrote in an e-mail to
clients. He has a hold recommendation for CME, with a $6 price
estimate for the company’s U.S.-listed shares.  In  New York , the stock declined 10 percent to $4.75 by
10:55 a.m. local time, the lowest price this year, valuing the
company at $366 million.  The company is facing a drop in ad revenue as the region’s
economies struggle to recover from a slowdown. CME plans to cut
costs and is in talks with its 49.9 percent shareholder  Time
Warner Inc. (TWX)  regarding its possible participation in a public or
private equity offering, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
