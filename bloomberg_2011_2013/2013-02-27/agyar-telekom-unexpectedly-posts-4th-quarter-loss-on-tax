Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
phone unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , unexpectedly posted a fourth-
quarter loss as a new telephone tax wiped out profit and as
management forecast declining sales for this year.  The loss attributable to owners of the parent was 1.6
billion forint ($7.1 million) in October-December, compared with
a 40.3 billion forint loss a year earlier, the company said in a
statement to the Budapest bourse today. The mean estimate of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a profit of 505 million
forint.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, an indicator closely watched by analysts and
investors, may decline by 4 percent to 7 percent this year while
sales revenue may decline as much as 3 percent, Chief Executive
Officer Christopher Mattheisen forecast in the report.  Ebitda in the fourth quarter declined 21 percent to 37
billion forint as a new phone-call tax cost the company an extra
4.4 billion forint compared with the year-ago period. Ebitda
fell 9.1 percent to 52.5 billion forint when excluding
investigation-related costs and provisions, severance expenses
and extraordinary taxes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
