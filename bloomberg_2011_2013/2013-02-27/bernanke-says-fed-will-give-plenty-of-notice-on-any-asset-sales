Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the central bank will provide notice before
starting to sell assets as it eventually exits from record
monetary easing.  “At the time we decided to begin sales we would give
plenty of notice and proceed slowly and do so in a way
consistent with our macro objectives,” he said in Washington
today in response to questions from members of the House
Financial Services Committee.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
