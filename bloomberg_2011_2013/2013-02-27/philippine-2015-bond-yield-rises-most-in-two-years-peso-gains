Philippine two-year bonds fell, with
the yield rising the most in two years, on speculation faster
inflation will forestall further monetary easing. The peso rose.  Consumer prices may have risen as much as 3.7 percent this
month, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said yesterday.
That would be the fastest since August and compares with 3
percent in January, a three-month high. Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke defended the U.S. authority’s bond-buying
program yesterday after minutes of the Federal Open Market
Committee’s Jan. 29-30 meeting released last week showed policy
makers were divided about the strategy behind asset purchases.  “The curve steepened on some inflation concern, continuing
debate on the extent of U.S. quantitative easing and renewed
uncertainty in  Europe ,” said Bunny Bernardo-Recto, vice
president at Chinatrust Philippines Commercial Bank Corp. in
 Manila .  The yield on the 12.375 percent peso bond due February 2015
rose 27 basis points, or 0.27 percentage point, to 2.73 percent,
posting its steepest increase since Feb. 9, 2011, according to
midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. The
yield on the  benchmark 10-year debt rose 11 basis points to
4.27 percent.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 40.732 per dollar at the
noon trading break in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, was unchanged at 3.9
percent.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas cut the rate it pays on about
$42 billion in special-deposit accounts to 3 percent from more
than 3.5 percent last month, while maintaining the benchmark
overnight  borrowing rate  at a record low 3.5 percent. There is
room to further refine the special accounts to keep it as a
liquidity management tool and not an investment outlet, Tetangco
said on Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
