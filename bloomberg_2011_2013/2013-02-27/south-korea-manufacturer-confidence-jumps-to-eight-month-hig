South Korean manufacturers’
confidence rose to the highest in eight months as improving
demand offsets cost disadvantages caused by the sliding yen.  An index measuring expectations for March increased to 76
from 72 for February, the Bank of Korea said in a statement in
 Seoul  today. A measure of expectations at non-manufacturing
companies fell to 69 from 70. A reading below 100 indicates that
pessimists outnumber optimists.  Today’s index is based on a survey conducted between Feb.
14 and Feb. 21 with responses from 1,500 manufacturers and
1,042non-manufacturers.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
