West  Texas  Intermediate oil rose in
 New York  as U.S. durable goods and housing data exceeded
forecasts, signs an economic rebound may spur fuel demand.  Futures climbed 13 cents after data bolstered confidence
for growth in the world’s largest crude-consuming country. U.S.
oil supplies increased 1.13 million barrels to 377.5 million
last week, the highest level since July, an Energy Information
Administration report showed. A 2.5 million-barrel gain was
projected in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  “Much of the economic data is looking pretty good, which
is supporting the markets,” said  Chip Hodge , who oversees a $9
billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing
director at Manulife Asset Management in  Boston . “Inventories
are sound. There’s no reason to be concerned about them now.”  Crude oil for April delivery settled at $92.76 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The volume of all futures
traded was 18 percent below the 100-day average at 3:47 p.m.
Prices have gained 1 percent this year and have declined 4.9
percent this month.  Brent for April settlement fell 84 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to end the session at $111.87 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Prices have dropped 3.2 percent so far
this month. The volume of all futures traded was 3.3 percent
higher than the 100-day average for this time.  The European benchmark crude was at a $19.11 premium to WTI
futures, the least since Feb. 1.  U.S. Economy  Orders for U.S. durable goods excluding transportation
equipment, which is often volatile, climbed 1.9 percent in
January, exceeding the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, Commerce Department data showed. An index of pending
home resales rose 4.5 percent to 105.9, the most since April
2010, the National Association of Realtors said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.5 percent, and the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 1.4 percent. The euro
strengthened as much as 0.6 percent to $1.3141.  “The fundamentals of the economy are supporting oil, even
though the market itself is well supplied,” said David McAlvany, chief executive officer of McAlvany Financial Group in
Durango,  Colorado , which manages $520 million. “The market has
been well supplied for a while and is now a little more so.”  Political Headwinds  Italian political leaders sparred over forming a government
after inconclusive elections last weekend. U.S. President  Barack Obama  summoned congressional leaders to a meeting at the White
House March 1, the day $85 billion in spending cuts begin, as
both parties say a deal to avert them probably won’t come before
the deadline.  “The headwinds are political,” Hodge said. “The economic
indicators are decent but concerns about  Italy  and the budget
issues here are raising concerns about the future.”  Crude stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for New York futures, decreased 75,000 barrels to 50.6 million
barrels last week, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm. Cushing supplies rose to a record 51.9 million
last month.  U.S.  production  of crude slipped 22,000 barrels a day to
7.1 million last week. Output climbed to 7.12 million barrels a
day the prior week, the most since August 1992, as the
combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale formations in
states including  North Dakota , Texas and Oklahoma.  Refineries operated at 85.1 percent of capacity in the
seven days ended Feb. 22, up 2.2 percentage points from the
prior week. Units are often idled for maintenance in February as
attention shifts away from heating oil and before gasoline
consumption rises.  Gasoline Output  Gasoline  production  gained 3.1 percent to 9.21 million
barrels a day last week, the most this year, the report showed.
Inventories of the fuel decreased 1.86 million barrels to 228.5
million last week.  “The low rate of refinery activity and what that would
mean for gasoline supplies was a major concern ahead of the
report,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. “The rebound in refinery runs argues
against any worries there. Gasoline production was up more than
360,000 barrels from a year earlier.”  Gasoline for March delivery fell 12.51 cents, or 4.2
percent, to $2.8565 a gallon on Nymex, the lowest settle since
Jan. 23. The futures have tumbled 7.2 percent so far this week.  Fuel Demand  Consumption of gasoline rose 1.9 percent to 8.6 million
barrels a day last week, the EIA report showed. Total  fuel
demand  climbed 1.5 percent to 18.7 million barrels a day.  World powers and  Iran  ended two days of talks without
agreement on the country’s nuclear program. Iranian nuclear
negotiator Saeed Jalili said negotiations with the U.S. and its
partners will resume next month in Istanbul after discussions in
Almaty,  Kazakhstan , concluded.  “The result of the discussions is yet another example in a
series of postponements,” said  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of
commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in  London .
“Geopolitical tensions with Iran can easily flare up and boost
the  risk premium  embedded in the oil price.”  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 395,454
contracts as of 3:47 p.m. It totaled 408,997 contracts
yesterday, 25 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.65 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
