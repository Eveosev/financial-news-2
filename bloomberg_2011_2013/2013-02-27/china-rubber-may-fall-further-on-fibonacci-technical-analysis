Natural rubber traded in Shanghai
may drop through 23,650  yuan  ($3,793) a ton and extend declines
after breaching Fibonacci resistance levels in the past week,
according to Zhongcai Futures Co.  Rubber for September delivery, the most-active contract on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange, is poised to test the level,
which represents a two-thirds retracement after a rally from
September to early February this year, said Zhao Cheng, a
Chongqing-based analyst at the brokerage.  “The slump in the past week or so was very swift and
breached all the major support levels, including the one-third
and the 50 percent retracement levels,” Zhao said. “From a
technical analysis point of view, this indicates further
declines.”  Natural rubber, used to make tires and gloves, slumped to
the lowest close since Nov. 30 yesterday as concern deepened
that demand from  China  may slow as the government moves to
combat excess liquidity and rising property prices.  The contract for September delivery rose 1.6 percent to
24,535 yuan a ton at 9:52 a.m. local time. The most active
contract declined for seven days through yesterday.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on a
theory that prices tend to drop or rise by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low. A support level indicates a price
at which buy orders may accumulate when a security is falling.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
