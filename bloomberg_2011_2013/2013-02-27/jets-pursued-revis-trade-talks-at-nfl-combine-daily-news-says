The New York Jets talked with teams
about trading All-Pro cornerback Darrelle Revis during the
National Football League Combine, the  New York Daily News
reported , citing an unidentified person familiar with the
situation.  New General Manager John Idzik was actively shopping Revis
at the league’s scouting combine in Indianapolis, and interested
teams are examining the Jets’ requirements for compensation and
Revis’s contract demands, the newspaper said without identifying
the other clubs.  Idzik, Jets owner Woody Johnson and coach Rex Ryan didn’t
meet with Revis’s agents during the combine, the Daily News
said. Revis, who played two games last season before tearing a
ligament in his left knee, is set to become an unrestricted free
agent after the 2013 season, when he is due to make $6 million
with the Jets.  Revis, 27, was selected as an All-Pro in three of his first
five NFL seasons and has been regarded by some analysts as the
best defensive player in the NFL when healthy. ESPN has said
Revis may be seeking as much as $16 million a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
