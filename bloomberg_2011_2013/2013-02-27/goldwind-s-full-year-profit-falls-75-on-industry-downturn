Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. (2208) , China’s biggest maker of  wind turbines , said
profit fell 75 percent last year as turbine sales declined in
its home market.  Net income was 153.1 million yuan ($25 million) in 2012,
compared with 606.7 million yuan a year earlier, Goldwind said
in a statement of preliminary results to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. That compares with a 172 million-yuan mean
estimate in a survey of eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  This is the second consecutive yearly earnings drop for the
company based in Urumuqi in the Xinjiang province. Installations
of wind turbines in China fell 18 percent to 15.9 gigawatts last
year from 2011, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.  The decline is “mainly due to an industry downturn,” the
company said. Revenue declined 12 percent to 11.3 billion  yuan .  The company said it expects to release final results on
March 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
