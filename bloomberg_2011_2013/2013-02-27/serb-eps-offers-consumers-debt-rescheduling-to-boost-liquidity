Elektroprivreda Srbije JP, Serbia’s
dominant power company, offered to reschedule debt of more than
400,000 consumers for 2012 unpaid bills as it tries to boost
liquidity and gauge how much it will borrow from banks.  The unprofitable state-run utility offered to write off as
much as 8 billion dinar ($94 million) interest on 76 billion
dinars owed by the consumers, in exchange for repayment of
principal over three months to two years, depending on size of
outstanding debt, Dragan Veljic, EPS’s chief for legal affairs,
told reporters in Belgrade today.  The company said Feb. 7 it may need 50 billion dinars from
lenders to pay suppliers and employers and service own debt in
2013. It later revised that to 30 billion dinars, on an expected
increase in power prices which should boost its  cash flow .  The offer to consumers is valid through March and EPS does
not “realistically expect” to close the agreements with all of
the consumers, Veljic said. The offer may bring in some 37
billion dinars over two years, while a decision on the size of
the  bank loan  may be reached in the coming weeks, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
