Industrial metals advanced after
new-home sales surged by the most in two decades in the U.S.,
and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  defended stimulus
measures, raising demand prospects from the second-largest user.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.8
percent to $7,919 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,895 by 1:17 p.m.  Shanghai  time. Lead
climbed as much as 1.4 percent to $2,329 a ton.  New home purchases in the U.S. jumped in January to the
highest level since July 2008, as confidence among U.S.
consumers gained more than forecast in February. Bernanke said
in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee that “we do
not see the potential costs of the increased risk-taking in some
financial markets as outweighing the benefits of promoting a
stronger economic recovery.”  “Bernanke’s comments helped to alleviate the concerns over
the exit of the huge stimulus program, at least for now,” Lian
Zheng, an analyst at Xinhu Futures Co., said by phone from
Shanghai. “The strong housing data also supported a rebound.”  Copper for delivery in June on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.8 percent to 57,580  yuan  ($9,247) a ton, and the
May contract on the Comex in  New York  was little changed at
$3.585 per pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
