Endesa SA (ELE)  suspended its  dividend  for
the first time after the Spanish government raised taxes on
utilities during a recession. The shares rose in  Madrid .  The electricity supplier majority-owned by Italy’s  Enel SpA (ENEL) 
announced the halt today after saying net income dropped 8
percent to 2.03 billion ($2.66 billion) last year. Keeping the
the 60.6 euro-cent a share dividend paid last year would have
cost Madrid-based Endesa 641 million euros.  The 68 year-old utility joins a group of Spain’s biggest
companies including Telefonica SA that canceled dividends or
paid them in stock, which dilutes earnings per share, as the
economy heads into a second  year of recession that’s curbing
 consumer spending  and power use.  The government decreed new taxes on utilities in the past
year, including a new 7 percent levy on income from generating
electricity, as it struggles to curb a swelling budget deficit
that’s compounded by the recession. Power demand fell about 1.2
percent last year.  Endesa’s gained 0.6 percent to 16.49 euros in Madrid,
erasing an earlier 3.3 percent loss. That beat the 0.3 percent
gain in Spain’s benchmark IBEX 35 and the 0.1 percent increase
in the  Bloomberg EMEA Electric Index. (BEUELEC)   The company reported operating cash flow slid 10 percent to
5.25 billion euros in 2012, noting that some of the new
government measures didn’t take effect until 2013. Enel, which
owns about 92 percent of Endesa, carried out “synergies” that
saved 1.05 billion euros, Endesa said in a statement today.  Even with the tougher business environment, Endesa shares
have gained 5.2 percent in the last three months, beating the
4.6 percent decline of the Bloomberg EMEA Electric Index.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
