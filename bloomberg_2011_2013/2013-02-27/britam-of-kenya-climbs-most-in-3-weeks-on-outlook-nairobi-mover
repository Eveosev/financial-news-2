British-American Investments Co. (BRIT) , a
Kenyan financial-services group advanced the most in more than
three weeks as investors bet the company made a profit and will
pay a higher dividend.  Shares of Britam, as the company is known, climbed a second
day, rising 3 percent to 6.80 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in
the capital, Nairobi, the biggest gain since Feb. 1, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. About 489,600 shares traded, or
more than double the three-month daily average.  Investors “are optimistic that the company will post
better results and pay a higher dividend than the 15 cents in
2011 when they made a loss,” Augustine Misoka, a research
analyst at Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  Net income is estimated at about 2.5 billion shillings ($29
million) in the 12 months through December compared with a loss
of 197.7 million shillings a year earlier, Misoka said.  The company swung to a profit of 1.68 billion shillings in
the six months through June after investment income surged
fivefold.  Britam was rated buy in new coverage by Sterling Capital on
Feb. 21 with a price target of 7.58 shillings. The stock was
also rated buy in new coverage at Standard Investment Bank Ltd.
on Jan. 30 with an 8.32-shilling target.  Britam’s stock has advanced 13 percent this year, outpacing
an 11 percent gain in the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share
Index. (NSEASI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
