Israeli lawmakers voiced strong
opposition to a possible sale of  Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)  to  Potash
Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  in a parliamentary meeting convened
in  Jerusalem  today to discuss the issue.  ICL, which mines chemicals from the  Dead Sea , is Israel’s
second-largest company by market value.  “The sale of ICL to a foreign company would be abandoning
residents of the Negev region and a slap in the face of every
citizen of Israel,” said Meir Cohen, a representative of the
Yesh Atid faction, Israel’s second biggest party. The meeting
was attended by more than 20 parliament members.  Potash Corp., the world’s largest fertilizer producer,
 currently holds about 14 percent  of ICL, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, and is seeking to purchase more than 50
percent.  Potash Corp. Chief Financial Officer Wayne Brownlee said
yesterday his company is suspending talks to acquire ICL due to
“political events.” Israel is in the process of forming a new
government following national elections on Jan. 22.  ICL added 0.4 percent today at 11:20 a.m. in  Tel Aviv 
trading, after closing down yesterday 2.5 percent. Controlling
shareholder Israel Corp. slipped 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
