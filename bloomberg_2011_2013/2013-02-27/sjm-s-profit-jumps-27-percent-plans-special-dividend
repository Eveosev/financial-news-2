SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , Asia’s biggest
casino company by revenue, reported a 27 percent increase in
full-year profit as mainland Chinese gamblers bet more.  Net income rose to HK$6.75 billion ($870 million) from
HK$5.3 billion a year earlier, according to a statement to the
Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. That beats a consensus
estimate of HK$6.6 billion from  25 analysts  compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company, founded by casino mogul  Stanley Ho , owns  20 of
the 35 casinos  in Macau and faces intensifying competition as
rivals including  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  and  Galaxy Entertainment Group
Ltd. (27)  expand. SJM won a land grant in October to build its first
casino resort in the Cotai area, a piece of reclaimed land in
Macau that is Asia’s equivalent of the  Las Vegas Strip .  “SJM’s market share remained steady and was gradually
improving,” in the fourth quarter, wrote Kenneth Fong, a Hong
Kong-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. ahead of the earnings
announcement.  Full-year adjusted earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, rose 10 percent to
HK$7.6 billion. The company proposed a special dividend of 30
Hong Kong cents a share, on top of a final dividend of 50 Hong
Kong cents a share.  SJM closed 1.8 percent higher at HK$20.15 in Hong Kong
yesterday, before the earnings statement. The stock has climbed
12 percent this year, outperforming the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index  which is down less than one percent.  Gambling Revenue  Macau’s casino revenue climbed 14 percent to a record 304
billion patacas ($38 billion) in 2012. SJM’s gambling revenue
for the year climbed 4.5 percent to HK$78.9 billion.  The former Macau gaming monopoly’s revenue from VIPs, or
high rollers, rose to HK$53.3 billion from HK$52.8 billion a
year ago, mass market revenue increased 13 percent to HK$24
billion. Slot-machine revenue also rose to HK$1.5 billion.  Sands earlier said it plans to invest at least $2.5 billion
to build its fifth resort, to be called the Parisian, in Macau,
the only city in China where casino gambling is legal. The
Parisian will have a replica of the Eiffel Tower and family-
oriented facilities to attract family-oriented gamblers from
China.  Smaller competitors such as  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  and  MGM China
Holdings Ltd. (2282)  have also been given approval to develop a casino
in Cotai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
