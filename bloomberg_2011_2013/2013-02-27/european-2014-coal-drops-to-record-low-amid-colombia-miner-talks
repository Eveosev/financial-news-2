European coal for next year fell to
a record as talks between striking workers and management at
Colombia’s Cerrejon mine started.  Thermal coal for delivery in 2014 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp dropped as much as 35 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$97.55 a metric ton, the lowest level since the contract started
trading in January 2010, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contract is set for a third monthly decline.  Talks between striking workers and management at the mine
may take four more days after starting yesterday, Marlon Gomes,
a negotiator for the National Coal Industry Workers Union, said
today.  Supply disruptions in Colombia, including the strike at
Cerrejon, its largest mine, have affected 84 percent of the
country’s thermal coal exports, according to Michael Hsueh, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. The country exported 79.4 million
tons of coal last year, of which 55 percent went to European
Union countries, he said in a Feb. 15 report.  Bloomberg tracks broker data from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
