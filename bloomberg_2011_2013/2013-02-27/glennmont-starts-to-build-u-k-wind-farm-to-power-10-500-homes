Glennmont Partners, the renewable-
energy fund being spun off from France’s  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , began
to build a wind farm in northern England that will generate
enough power for 10,500 homes.  The Todmorden Moor venture in west Yorkshire will use five
2.5-megawatt turbines made by Germany’s  Nordex SE (NDX1) , the London-
based fund said in an e-mailed statement. It will be operational
by the end of the year.  BNP Paribas agreed last month to spin off its 437 million-
euro ($571 million) renewables fund in the wake of increased
regulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
