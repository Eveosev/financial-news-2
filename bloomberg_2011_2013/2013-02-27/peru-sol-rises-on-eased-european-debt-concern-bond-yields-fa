Peru’s sol rose for the first time
in three days as concern eased that Italy’s election deadlock
will deepen Europe’s debt crisis, boosting demand for higher-
yielding assets.  The sol advanced 0.1 percent to 2.5815 per dollar at the
close of trading in Lima, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has declined 1.2 percent this year.  Italian 10-year bonds gained after the country sold debt in
its first auction following inconclusive election results that
pushed yields to a four-month high yesterday.  “Sentiment is playing in favor of currencies as European
markets recover,” said Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at the
local unit of Banco Santander.  Peru’s central bank said on its website it didn’t buy
dollars today.  The yield on Peru’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond due
in August 2020 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 3.86 percent at 2:55 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price increased 0.17 centimo to
125.44 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
