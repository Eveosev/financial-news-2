(Corrects time frame in second paragraph in story first
published yesterday.)  The London Metal Exchange, the
world’s largest metals marketplace, reported a 28 percent jump
in revenue last year after raising fees.  Revenue increased to $HK976 million ($126 million) from
$HK764 million a year earlier,  Hong Kong  Exchanges & Clearing
Ltd., the bourse’s parent company, said in an earnings report
today. The LME’s higher trading fees in July added HK$155
million, it said. The LME is planning to introduce its own
clearinghouse by the end of 2014, further boosting revenue.  Hong Kong Exchanges, the world’s largest exchange operator
by market value, acquired the LME in December for $2.2 billion
to expand into commodities. Copper on the LME fell 21 percent in
2011 on concern slower growth in China would curb demand from
the top metals buyer. Prices rose 4.4 percent in 2012.  “The urbanization, industrialization has led to China
emerging as a significant, major consumer of commodities,”
 Martin Abbott , chief executive officer of the LME, said at a
press conference in Hong Kong. “That is a trend that we do not
believe is likely to be reversed any time in the near future and
we have been a beneficiary of that growth.”  Fees Freeze  Hong Kong Exchanges pledged to freeze LME fees until at
least January 2015. The revenue from the LME would have been
$HK1.14 billion if higher fees that started July 2 were applied
for the entire year, Hong Kong Exchanges said. The LME delayed
the increase by four months after protests from some members.  Hong Kong Exchanges’ full-year profit fell 20 percent, the
first drop in three years, as turnover and listings declined.
Net income fell to HK$4.08 billion, or HK$3.74 a share, from
HK$5.09 billion, or HK$4.70 a share, in 2011. The LME had a loss
of  HK$29 million, based on earnings before income, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, compared with profit of HK$254
million the year before, it said.  “We are moving ahead with an expansion strategy for LME in
the Asian time zones,” Charles Li, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges,
said in a  statement  today. The exchange wants to develop Asian
time zone trading and clearing in commodities, extend the LME’s
warehouses into mainland  China  and improve the metals bourse’s
electronic platform.  The 136-year-old LME has a network of 765 warehouses in 36
locations in 14 countries, Hong Kong Exchanges said in today’s
statement. Its 93 members include Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG. The LME’s share of global base
metals futures rose to 83 percent last year from 80 percent in
2011, with open interest market share in zinc and aluminum
gaining, according to the exchange. Commodities contributed 1
percent to Hong Kong Exchanges’ revenue, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
