Argentine farmers will ship 2
million metric tons of soybeans from the 2011-2012 crop during
the next 20-30 days, executives from the largest 15 grains
exporters told Domestic Trade Secretary Guillermo Moreno, said
Alberto Rodriguez, president of the Grains Exporters chamber.  Moreno unexpectedly called last night for exporters to
summarize future shipments.  “It was a calmed-down meeting just between the exporters
and Moreno,” Rodriguez said in a phone interview from  Buenos
Aires . “The exporters detailed upcoming shipments and by
consensus said the 2012-13 soybean crop will produce 50 million
tons.”  Rodriguez said the 2012-13 soybean crop forecast may vary
within a range of 4 percent. Executives from Noble Argentina SA,
 Bunge Ltd (BG) , Cargill SACI, Nidera SA, were among those who
attended the meeting, Rodriguez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
