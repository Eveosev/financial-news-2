Sime (SIME)  Darby Bhd., the world’s biggest
listed palm-oil producer, reported a 36 percent drop in second-
quarter profit as prices of the commodity slid last year.  Net income  dropped to 708.5 million ringgit ($228 million),
or 11.79 sen a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31 from 1.1
billion ringgit, or 18.32 sen, a year earlier, Sime said in a
stock exchange filing today. The company proposed paying a lower
interim dividend of 7 sen per share.  Palm oil lost 23 percent last year, the worst drop since
the 2008 financial crisis, after  stockpiles  reached record
levels in Malaysia as the  European debt crisis  and a slowdown in
 China ’s growth curbed demand. Prices may decline further this
year after Asian producers boosted acreage which will raise
output and global oilseed supplies rose,  Dorab Mistry , a Godrej
International Ltd. director who’s traded the commodity for more
than 30 years, told Bloomberg in comments published yesterday.  “We are confident of riding out the current challenging
environment and reaping the benefits in the future when the
global economy gets on the recovery path,” Chief Executive
Officer Mohd Bakke Salleh said in the statement. “I am
confident that we will be able to achieve the targets we have
set for the full financial year.”  Sime  shares  fell 0.1 unchanged at 9.16 ringgit as of 2:35
p.m. in Kuala Lumpur today after the earnings announcement. The
stock has dropped 3.8 percent this year, tracking a similar
decline in the benchmark FTSE Bursa  Malaysia  KLCI Index.  Increased Output  Palm oil for May delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent to
2,439 ringgit a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange and was
at 2,436 ringgit at the end of the morning session. Futures
dropped to 2,217 ringgit on Dec. 13, the lowest level for the
most-active contract since November 2009.  Diversified Sime, which is based in Kuala Lumpur and
operates in more than 20 nations, received an average 2,207
ringgit a ton for palm oil in the quarter, compared with 2,804
ringgit a year earlier. Profit from plantations dropped 42
percent to 522 million ringgit due to lower prices and shipments
of crude palm oil, even as production of fresh fruit bunches
grew 12 percent, according to the filing.  The group’s industrial division posted a 4.3 percent drop
in profit to 285 million ringgit on weaker market conditions in
Malaysia and  Singapore . Earnings from property slumped 54
percent and contributions from energy and utilities dropped by
57 percent from a year earlier, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
