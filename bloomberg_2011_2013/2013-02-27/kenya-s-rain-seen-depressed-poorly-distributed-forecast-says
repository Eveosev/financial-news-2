  Kenya , the world’s biggest exporter
of black tea, is expected to receive “depressed and poorly
distributed” rainfall during March through May, the Kenya
Meteorological Department said.  The distribution, both in time and space, is expected to be
poor over most of the country, the Nairobi-based agency said in
an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
