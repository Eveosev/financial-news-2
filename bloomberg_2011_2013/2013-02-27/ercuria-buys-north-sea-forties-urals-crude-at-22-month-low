Mercuria Energy Trading SA bought

Russian Urals differentials dropped to the lowest in more than
22 months as Vitol Group sold amid rising supplies.  Refiners in  Asia  will trim imports of West African crude
for loading in March to the lowest level in five months after
Indonesia and  Japan  failed to buy any cargoes even as Chinese
buying rebounded.  North Sea  Mercuria bought Forties lot F0310 from Trafigura Beheer BV
for loading March 19 to March 21 at 25 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. That equals a trade
on Feb. 8.  Trafigura offered Forties lot F0304 for March 9 to March 11
at a discount of 15 cents to Dated Brent and F0316 for March 22
to March 24 at plus 40 cents to the benchmark without finding a
buyer, the survey showed.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc failed to find a buyer for Forties
consignment F0313 at 28 cents more than Dated Brent.  Seven cargoes of the grade for loading in March have now
been deferred, according to four traders with knowledge of the
matter. Lots F0309 and F0310 will both be shipped four days
later than planned, from March 18 to March 20 and March 19 to
March 21 respectively, the people said, asking not to be
identified as the information is confidential.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was 9 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, a
decrease of 8 cents from yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest since Dec. 31.  Brent for April settlement traded at $112.37 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $113.08 in the previous session. The May
contract was at $111.47, a discount of 90 cents to April.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol Group sold 140,000 metric tons of Urals to Glencore
International Plc at a discount of $3.40 a barrel to Dated Brent
on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the Platts survey
showed. That’s 70 cents less than the cargo the company sold
yesterday and the lowest since April 28 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  OAO Lukoil’s Litasco failed to find a buyer for the grade
at $2.90 less than the benchmark, according to the survey.  Russia plans to ship 1.6 million barrels a day of Urals
from Primorsk and Ust-Luga in March, up 7.5 percent from
February, according to a final loading program.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened 28 cents a barrel to $2.54, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That’s the least since April 17. In northwest Europe, the
 discount  was at $2.79 a barrel, compared with $2.56 in the

and 1.59 million in October.  Bharat Petroleum Corp. bought 3 million barrels of crude
for loading in April, said two traders who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  The Indian refiner purchased about 1 million barrels each
of the Nigerian Akpo, Angolan Nemba and Algerian Saharan Blend
