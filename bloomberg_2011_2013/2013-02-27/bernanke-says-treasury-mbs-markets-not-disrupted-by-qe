Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the central bank’s asset purchases haven’t
disrupted the markets for Treasuries or mortgage-backed
securities.  The Fed is “heavily engaged” in monitoring market
functioning and “to this point, we haven’t seen anything
significant,” Bernanke said in Washington today in response to
questions from members of the House Financial Services
Committee.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
