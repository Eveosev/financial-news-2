Bertelsmann SE’s  Random House  sought
European Union approval to buy  Pearson Plc (PSON) ’s Penguin unit to
create the largest  book publisher  in the U.K. and the U.S.  The European Commission set an initial deadline of April 5
to rule on the deal, according to a  filing  on its website today.  The joint venture, named Penguin Random House and to be
based in New York, will be 53 percent-owned by Guetersloh,
Germany-based Bertelsmann, with London-based Pearson holding the
remainder, the companies said in October. Bertelsmann CEO Thomas Rabe said the venture between 77-year-old Penguin and  87-year-
old  Random House will control about 25 percent of the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
