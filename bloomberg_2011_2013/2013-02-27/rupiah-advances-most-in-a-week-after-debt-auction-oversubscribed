Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced by the
most in a week and bonds gained after orders at a government
debt auction yesterday exceeded the amount on offer.  The  finance ministry  raised 7.6 trillion rupiah ($784
million) from the local-currency sovereign sale, compared with
the 7 trillion rupiah target, according to a statement on its
website. Investors bid for 2.6 times the offered amount. Global
funds added 6.3 trillion rupiah to their  holdings  of the
securities this month through Feb. 22, the most since November,
taking total ownership to a record 279.5 trillion rupiah,
finance ministry data show.  “The potential for the rupiah to strengthen is still
there,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, Jakarta-based head of treasury
research at PT Bank Negara Indonesia. “There’s positive
sentiment as the bond auction was oversubscribed, which shows
strong demand for local assets.”  The rupiah climbed 0.2 percent to 9,685 per dollar as of
10:05 a.m. in Jakarta, the biggest gain since Feb. 20, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It has appreciated
0.6 percent this month, the best performance in  Asia .  The currency traded at a 0.2 percent premium to one-month
non-deliverable forwards, which rose 0.2 percent to 9,710 per
dollar. A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,705 yesterday, compared with 9,713 on Feb. 25 by the
Association of Banks in  Singapore , which publishes the rate at
11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, which measures
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, held
at 6.40 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 31.  The yield on the government’s 11 percent bonds due October
2014 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.33
percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. At the previous government debt auction on Feb. 14,
investors bid for 4.2 times the 7 trillion rupiah on offer,
compared with 2.4 times at a Jan. 29 sale for the same amount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
