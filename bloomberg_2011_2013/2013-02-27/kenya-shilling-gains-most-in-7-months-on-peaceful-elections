Kenya ’s shilling rose the most in
seven months amid speculation next week’s presidential elections
will proceed without violence.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.9 percent to 86.55 per dollar and traded 0.6 percent
stronger at 86.75 by 1:33 p.m. in Nairobi, climbing the most on
a closing basis since July 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Kenya will hold its presidential vote on March 4, the first
since a disputed 2007 ballot sparked two months of violence in
which more than 1,100 people died. Police said yesterday they
were deploying extra forces in areas perceived as hotspots to
prevent fighting.  “The shilling has gained due to the positive sentiment in
the market that the elections will be peaceful,”  Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading at Nairobi-based  Kenya Commercial Bank
Ltd. (KNCB) , said today.  The  International Monetary Fund  said Kenya’s economy may
expand 5.5 percent to 6 percent this year, as long as peaceful
elections show stability for investors.  “All government agencies are ready for the elections and
have put in place mechanisms to ensure they are peaceful,”
Ahmed Issack Hassan, chairman of the Independent and Electoral
Commission said today on Citizen TV.  The  Central Bank  of Kenya offered 10 billion shillings
($115 million) of bids for 14 days term-auction deposits today,
according to a central bank official who asked not to be
identified in line with policy. The bank uses the securities to
reduce  money supply  and support the shilling.  Uganda ’s currency traded weaker for the second day,
depreciating 0.4 percent to 2,665 per dollar, while the
Tanzanian shilling gained for a third day, appreciating 0.4
percent to 1,623.50 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
