Martha Lane Fox, known for founding
online travel company Lastminute.com Ltd., was appointed to the
U.K. Parliament’s upper, unelected House of Lords, where she’ll
be known as Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho.  Lane Fox, who’ll have to add a hyphen to her name under
Lords rules, joked on her  Twitter Inc. feed  about her choice of
Soho, a central London district known both for its strip clubs
and its popularity among people in the creative industries.  “Get free cocktails and nipple tassles right?” she said
in one posting. She subsequently deleted the posting, saying it
was a “joke to friend” and had been intended “not for
everyone.”  Lane Fox will sit as an independent member of the chamber,
which usually works to revise and scrutinize legislation from
the lower, elected, House of Commons. Age 40, she will be its
youngest female member. She co-founded Lastminute.com in 1998
and became a millionaire in the 2000 initial sale of shares to
the public. She is now a non-executive director of Marks &
Spencer Plc and has set up a charity to help other charities use
the internet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
