Colombian peso bond yields fell as
speculation that annual inflation slowed this month boosted
demand for the fixed-rate securities.  Yields on  Colombia ’s benchmark peso-denominated bonds due
in 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.02
percent at 11:31 a.m. in Bogota, according to the central bank.
It fell to 4.97 percent on Feb. 22, the lowest level since the
securities were issued in 2009.  Annual inflation slowed to 1.91 percent in February from 2
percent the previous month, according to the median estimate of
13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That’s below the lower end
of the central bank’s target rage of 3 percent plus or minus one
percentage point. The national statistics agency is slated to
publish its monthly consumer prices report on March 5.  “We should start to see a bit more volatility in bonds as
investors start to price in inflation expectations,” Jorge Cardozo, a fixed-income analyst at Corredores Asociados SA
brokerage, said in a telephone interview from Bogota.
“Inflation will come in lower than the target range,” boosting
the returns for the fixed-rate securities, he said.  The government today auctioned 400 billion pesos ($220
million) of fixed-rate bonds, known as TES. The  Finance Ministry 
sold November 2018 securities to yield 4.46 percent, May 2022 to
yield 4.74 percent and April 2028 to yield 5.18 percent. Demand
was 1.7 times the amount offered, the ministry said in an e-
mailed statement.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 1,815.75 per  U.S. dollar .
It closed yesterday at 1,817.81, the weakest closing level since
Nov. 28. The peso has declined 2.7 percent in 2013 as the
government and central bank announced increased dollar purchases
to stem a rally that sent the local currency to a 17-month
intraday high on Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
