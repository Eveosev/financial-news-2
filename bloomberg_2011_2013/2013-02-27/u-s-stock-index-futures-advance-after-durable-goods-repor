showed orders for U.S. durable goods excluding transportation
gear climbed in January by the most in a year.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures expiring next month
increased 0.1 percent to 1,494.2 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York .  Bookings for equipment meant to last at least three years
minus demand for things such as aircraft, which is often
volatile, climbed 1.9 percent, exceeding the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg and the most since December
2011, Commerce Department data showed today in Washington. Total
orders dropped more than projected, reflecting the biggest slump
in defense bookings in a decade.  Pending sales of existing homes rose 1.8 percent in January
after a 4.3 decline the previous month, economists predicted
