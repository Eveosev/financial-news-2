Bouygues SA (EN) ,  France ’s second-largest
building company, forecast margins will widen this year after
reporting a 41 percent drop in 2012 profit as its phone unit
business suffered from competition.  Net income fell to 633 million euros ($837 million) from
1.07 billion euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said
today in a statement, beating an  average estimate  of 584 million
euros from nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Bouygues will
pay a  dividend  of 1.60 euros per share in 2013, unchanged from
last year.  “Results reflected the upheaval on the mobile telecoms
market and a challenging economic environment,” Bouygues said.
“2012 should mark the low point in Bouygues group’s
profitability.”  Bouygues’s phone unit last year cut prices and introduced
new services to respond to  Iliad SA (ILD) , which started a discount
mobile phone service. At the same time, Bouygues’s broadcasting
unit TF1 was hurt by a rise in programing costs, and its road
building unit Colas suffered from higher raw-material prices.  To mitigate the drop in phone revenue, which is also due
for a cut in so-called call-termination rates, Bouygues Telecom,
France’s third-largest mobile-phone operator, has been cutting
jobs and paring marketing spending.  Bouygues said it aims to “stabilize” the unit’s earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and
“improve the Ebitda minus capex item from 2013.”  Bouygues  sales , which rose by 3 percent to 33.5 billion
euros in 2012, may be little changed this year as revenue at
Bouygues Telecom is expected to drop 7 percent to 4.85 billion
euros, Bouygues said.  Bouygues’s construction backlog rose 8 percent from a year
earlier to 26.8 billion euros at the end of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
