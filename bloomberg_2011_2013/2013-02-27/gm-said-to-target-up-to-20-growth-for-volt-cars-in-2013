General Motors Co. (GM)  is planning to
build as many as 36,000 Chevrolet Volts and other plug-in
hybrids for worldwide delivery this year, 20 percent more than
in 2012, two people familiar with the effort said.  GM is planning to build 1,500 to 3,000 of the fuel-
efficient vehicles a month, said the people, who didn’t want to
be identified because the target isn’t public. GM sold about
30,000 Volt and similar Opel Ampera cars globally in 2012, said
 Jim Cain , a company spokesman, who declined to give a target for
this year.  Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson has struggled to
compete against more successful alternative-power vehicles such
as  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Prius. The CEO originally touted the
Volt’s gasoline-and-electric system as the technology of the
future and forecast global Volt sales of 60,000 in 2012, before
settling for half that amount.  The 36,000 target is “probably a doable number,”  Jim Hall , principal of consultancy 2953 Analytics, said. “It will
have a full calendar year in  Europe ” and GM will probably sell
more this year now that the Volt is eligible for the car-pool
lane in  California , he said.  Battery-only and plug-in hybrids that meet strict
California emissions rules qualify for a sticker that permits
solo drivers to use the lanes with vehicles carrying  multiple
passengers .  The plug-in Volt can travel 38 miles (61 kilometers) on
electric power before a gasoline engine engages to recharge the
battery. Plug-in hybrids can also be recharged by plugging into
an electrical outlet. U.S. sales of the Volt more than tripled
last year to 23,461, about half of Akerson’s original target of
45,000.  ‘Very Frustrating’  After last year, which included temporary production
shutdowns, the Detroit-based automaker wants to find a
consistent selling rate for Volt, Cristi Landy, GM’s marketing
director for small cars, said in an interview this month in
 Chicago .  “We had some on and off starts with the assembly plant,”
she said. “California, which is our strongest market, was
selling great then they would have no products. They’ve run out
of products probably three or four times in the last 12 months,
it’s been very frustrating.” GM produces the Volt at its
Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant.  Besides the  Chevy Volt  and Opel Ampera, GM plans to start
production of the Cadillac ELR, a two-door plug-in hybrid that
uses Volt-like technology.  Consumer Reports  GM shares rose 2.1 percent to $27.40 at the close in  New
York . They’ve declined 5 percent this year compared with a 6.3
percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Akerson said during a Bloomberg Radio interview in April
2012 that he wanted to increase U.S. Volt sales to 3,000 a
month. In June, he cut his original 2012 forecast of 60,000
worldwide and 45,000 U.S. Volt sales to “somewhere between”
35,000 and 40,000, without specifying a breakdown by region.  Slow sales have exasperated GM executives as the Volt got
entangled in U.S. presidential politics last year with
Republicans criticizing it as a symbol of President  Barack
Obama ’s auto-industry bailout.  The Volt, chosen as 2011’s North American  Car of the Year ,
succeeded in satisfying its customers, with 92 percent of survey
respondents telling  Consumer Reports  they would buy one again --
the second straight year it ranked highest.  Toyota’s Prius  The Volt went on sale in 2010 with the aim of putting GM’s
Chevrolet brand on the forefront of green technology globally
and taking on Toyota’s mass-market  Prius hybrid , which starts at
$24,200. Toyota also sells a subcompact Prius c that sells for
$19,080.  Toyota sold a record 892,519 Prius models worldwide in
2012, according to Carly Schaffner, a spokeswoman for the
automaker. The figure includes four models -- the main
hatchback, the v wagon, a plug-in hybrid and the c subcompact
that’s sold in  Japan  as the Aqua.  GM, Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  are
competing to be the top-selling automaker in the world. Toyota
overtook GM last year as No. 1 while the U.S. automaker finished
second, outselling VW by more than 130,000 deliveries.
Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW says it wants to become the world’s
biggest by 2018.  Starting at $39,145, the four-seat Volt is loaded with
pricey batteries and more expensive than a similar-size gasoline
compact, even with a $7,500 U.S. tax credit. The Toyota Corolla,
for example, starts at $16,230.  To contact the reporter on this story:
