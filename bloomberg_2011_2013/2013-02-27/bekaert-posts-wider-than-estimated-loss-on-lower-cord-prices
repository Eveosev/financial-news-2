Bekaert NV (BEKB) , the world’s largest
maker of steel cord for tires, posted a loss that was wider than
analysts estimated as waning demand from tiremakers cut into
prices and integration costs wiped out profit in Asia.  The net loss of 194.9 million euros ($255 million) compares
with analyst projections of a 185.6 million-euro shortfall,
according to the average of five  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The figure includes 202 million euros of
restructuring expenses and equipment writedowns, mostly linked
to the collapse of the sawing-wire business, the company, based
in Zwevelgem,  Belgium , said in a statement today.  Bekaert eliminated almost 3,200 positions last year to help
save 100 million euros annually by 2014 and said 20 million
euros of cuts so far “largely” offset lower prices for its
tire cord in Asia, while clients in the U.S. were hurt by Asian
imports and a delay in truck tire replacement.  “What the impact will be of what we have been doing fully
depends on where the economy is going,” Chief Executive Officer
Bert De Graeve told analysts on a conference call today. “Our 7
percent Ebit margin target may be stretched if our cost cuts are
only to offset price pressure.”  Bekaert declined 23 cents, or 1.1 percent, to 20.54 euros
by 4:55 p.m. on Euronext Brussels after touching 20.05 euros,
the lowest intraday value since Dec. 14, in earlier  trading . The
shares have lost 6.2 percent so far this year.  Accounts Receivable  The company cut its  dividend  by 27 percent to 85 cents a
share, compared with a 50-cent forecast by Bloomberg research
and analysis. Net financial debt fell to 700 million euros by
year-end from 866 million euros on June 30 as Bekaert improved
collection of accounts receivable in  China  in the final quarter.  “The lower net debt could support valuation to the tune of
about 2 euros per share,” Filip De Pauw, an analyst at ING
Groep NV in Brussels, said in an investor note. “Consensus for
2013, 2014 however could be revised down by 15 percent to 20
percent, which could negatively impact valuation by 3 to 4 euros
per share.”  Bekaert forecast cost savings will total 70 million euros
this year, including the 20 million euros already implemented.
Inflation will absorb about 15 million euros of savings,
underscoring the need for global growth, De Graeve said.  “The  PMI indexes  are rather high, while we do not see a
real consistent growth yet linked to what the purchase managers
would actually think,” De Graeve said in an interview today.
