South Africa will introduce laws to
regulate the retirement industry later this year as it seeks to
encourage savings, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  Companies must identify funds for exiting members to
preserve their savings when they change jobs, Gordhan said in
his budget speech in Cape Town today. Funds will also be
required to assist members to convert their savings into regular
income after retirement.  “Tax-preferred savings and investment accounts will be
introduced in 2015,” Gordhan said. “The tax treatment of
pension, provident and retirement annuity funds will be
simplified and harmonized.”  About half of the nation’s household savings enter the 2.4
trillion rand ($272 billion) pension and retirement industry and
more money has been withdrawn from the system in the past few
years than contributed, according to the National Treasury. It
estimates only about 10 percent of South Africans are able to
maintain their pre-retirement level of consumption after they
stop working.  Planned changes include giving provident fund members a tax
deduction of 27.5 percent of their contributions, capped at
350,000 rand a year. The same deduction limits will be applied
to contributions to pension and retirement annuity funds by
individuals and their employers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
