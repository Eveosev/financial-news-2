Esure Group Plc , the U.K. motor
insurer started by  Direct Line Insurance Group Plc (DLG)  founder Peter Wood, said it plans an initial public offering as its chairman
reduces his holding.  The company plans to raise 50 million pounds ($76 million)
in the offering of new shares, while Wood, the chairman, and
Tosca Penta Investments LP will also sell stock, the company
said in a statement today. The company, based in Surrey,
England, will use the money to repay a loan from Tosca, which it
received during its  management buyout  from  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY)  in 2010.  Wood is taking advantage of rising equity markets in the
beginning of 2013 as he seeks to build a more diverse base of
investors. A successful share sale would follow  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc ’s IPO of Direct Line, the U.K.’s biggest home
and motor insurer, which raised 787 million pounds for the
lender in October. Direct Line is up 12.2 percent since then.  Esure is going public after reporting full-year pretax
profit more than doubled to 115.5 million pounds. The general
insurer seeks to beat its competitors by targeting safer drivers
such as people over the age of 30 and women, who it sells to
through its Sheila’s Wheels brand.  “Our record of outperformance is down to our granular
understanding of risk, our conservative underwriting approach
and our speed in reacting to change,” Wood said in the
statement.  Deutsche Bank AG,  JPMorgan Cazenove ,  Canaccord Genuity  and
Numis Securities Ltd. are advising on the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
