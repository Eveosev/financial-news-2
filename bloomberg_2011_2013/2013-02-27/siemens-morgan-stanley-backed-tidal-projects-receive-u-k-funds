The U.K awarded 20 million pounds
($30 million) to tidal power projects backed by  Siemens AG (SIE)  and
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  as it seeks to boost renewable generation.  The Department of Energy and Climate Change gave 10 million
pounds to a project in Anglesey, Wales, that will use systems
developed by Marine Current Turbines Ltd., which was bought by
Siemens last year, Energy and Climate Change Minister  Greg Barker  told a conference today in London. It also awarded funds
to MeyGen Ltd., owned 45 percent by Morgan Stanley, to install
turbines off the Inner Sound in Scotland.  The projects, expected to operate by 2016, offer “learning
and evidence” needed to move marine power to commercialization,
Barker said. No commercial-scale projects are now operating.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
