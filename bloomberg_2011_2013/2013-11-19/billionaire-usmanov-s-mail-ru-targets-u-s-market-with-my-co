Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL) , Russian
billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ’s Internet company, opened an office
in Silicon Valley as it offers mobile communication services and
games in the U.S.  Mail.ru, a Moscow-based operator of social networks and
online games valued at $8.2 billion in London trading, has about
100 million users in Russian-speaking countries. It’s seeking to
expand under the My.Com brand globally.  With an office in Mountain View, California, the company is
now providing e-mail manager MyMail, messaging service MyChat
and free gaming platform MyGames in the U.S., the online
operator said today in a statement.  “Mail.ru is already big in Russia and their ambition for
international expansion seems logical,” said  Anna Lepetukhina ,
analyst at Sberbank CIB. “Still, the U.S. is a very competitive
market and they need to offer something unique to draw enough
users to be able to monetize services successfully later on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
