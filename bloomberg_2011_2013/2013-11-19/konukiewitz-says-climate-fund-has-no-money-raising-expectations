Manfred Konukiewitz, co-chairman of
the  Green Climate Fund , said the provider of financing to
developing nations has no clear expectation of how much money it
will secure next year in a planned initial raising.  Konukiewitz told reporters in Warsaw earlier today that he
expected the fund would probably raise between $6 billion, the
amount secured by a group of  climate investment funds 
administered by the  World Bank  in  New York , and $30 billion, the
amount of  finance provided  by richer nations through 2012.  “I didn’t want to make any prediction about how much the
fund will raise,” Konukiewitz said today by phone.  Almost 200 nations are meeting for United Nations climate
talks this week in Warsaw.  Developing countries  are seeking from
$60 billion to $70 billion in climate finance by 2016, PwC, the
accounting firm, said today in an e-mailed statement, citing
countries it didn’t name.  Envoys at the talks in the Polish capital intend to craft a
new agreement by 2015. At the same time, richer countries are
trying to meet a pledge to provide $100 billion a year in
climate aid by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
