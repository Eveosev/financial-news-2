originally scheduled because of the recent partial Federal
government shutdown. Data collection for the estimates in this
release had not been completed prior to the shutdown. However,
they were collected after the shutdown ended. In addition, the
processing of estimates and the production of the Employment
Cost Index news release were delayed due to the shutdown.  Corrections to ECI Data Series  Some Employment Cost Index estimates from September 2012 through
March 2013 were corrected on June 26, 2013. (Seasonally adjusted
estimates were subject to corrections back to March 2008.) For
further information, see:
www.bls.gov/bls/eci_corrections_043013.htm.  Updated Employment Weights  Beginning with the December 2013 news release, the Employment
Cost Index will introduce new employment weights based on the
2010 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system and the
2012 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  SOURCE: U.S. Department of Labor  To contact the reporter on this story:
