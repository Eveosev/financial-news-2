Metro AG,  Germany ’s biggest
retailer, is considering a partial initial public offering of
its Russian Cash & Carry unit to raise money for expansion.  The company would retain control of the unit after selling
a minority stake, Metro said today in an e-mailed statement. No
formal decision has been made, it said.  “We intend to further tap into the still strong Russian
market growth potential from the already strong market position
of our Russian subsidiary,” the Dusseldorf-based retailer said.
“Therefore, we are currently reviewing additional funding
source options for a step-up in expansion.”  Metro  rose  as much as 7.5 percent in Frankfurt trading, the
steepest intraday gain since Aug. 1, and was up 6.2 percent at
35.59 euros as of 5:13 p.m. Reuters reported earlier that the
retailer was considering an IPO of its  Russia  unit that could be
worth more than $1 billion.  Metro has about 70 Cash & Carry wholesale stores in Russia,
which generated sales of 4.1 billion euros ($5.55 billion) in
2012, according to the company’s annual report. Group revenue
last year was 66.7 billion euros.  Metro said in June it planned to invest $750 million in
Russia over five years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
