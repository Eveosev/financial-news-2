Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, and Senator Michael Lee, a
Utah Republican, introduced legislation to protect businesses
and innovators who are targeted by so-called patent trolls.  The objective of the bipartisan Patent Transparency and
Improvements Act of 2013 is to increase transparency in patent
ownership, make procedural reforms in patent litigation, combat
frivolous demand letters and improve resources for small
businesses that are targeted in patent infringement suits, among
other provisions, according to a statement yesterday from
Leahy’s office.   Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, is an original
co-sponsor of the bill.  Leahy said in a statement that “America’s patent system is
the envy of the world, but unfortunately some bad actors are
misusing the system to sue unsuspecting consumers or extort
monetary settlements by making misleading demands.”  Apple Can Seek U.S. Block of Samsung Smartphones, Court Says  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  can pursue a ban on sales of some  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930)  products found to infringe its patents on
smartphone features, after winning a U.S. appeals court ruling.  The patents cover features that Apple says make its iPhone
unique, such as multitouch technology. The Cupertino,
California-based company can’t block Samsung products for
infringing patented designs, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit said in an  opinion  posted yesterday on its
website. The ruling gives Apple another chance to curb sales of
its top competitor in the $279.9 billion market for smartphones.  Apple must prove the features were a factor customers used
in selecting which smartphone to buy, though it doesn’t have to
show that it was the single driving factor, the court ruled. The
trial judge, in rejecting Apple’s request for a sales block on
Samsung phones, said Apple would have to prove that each feature
drove sales of smartphones.  “To the extent these statements reflect the view that
Apple was necessarily required to show that a patented feature
is the sole reason for consumers’ purchases, the court erred,”
the three-judge panel in  Washington  ruled. “Rather than show
that a patented feature is the exclusive reason for consumer
demand, Apple must show some connection between the patented
feature and demand for Samsung’s products.”  While many of the phones in this case are no longer sold,
Apple has another case against Samsung going to trial in March
over newer models, including Samsung’s Galaxy S III. Should U.S.
District Judge Lucy Koh, who is presiding over the case, impose
a ban on the older models, Apple could argue that newer phones
are the same products gussied up with new names.  The question sent back to the judge “concerns a very
narrow scope of evidence presented by Apple,” Adam Yates, a
Samsung spokesman, said in a statement. The company is confident
it can avoid any sales ban, he said.  Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return messages seeking comment.  For more, click here.  Emerson, ABB Rebuffed by Top Court in $111 Million Patent Case  The U.S. Supreme Court let stand a $111 million award won
by SynQor Inc. in a patent-infringement suit against nine makers
of computer-system power converters, including units of  Emerson
Electric Co. (EMR)  and  ABB Ltd. (ABB)   The justices yesterday turned away an appeal by the
defendants, leaving intact a jury verdict and appeals court
decision favoring SynQor, a manufacturer based in Boxborough,
 Massachusetts .  The dispute involved safety features that control how much
electricity goes to large computer systems, as well as to
telecommunication and data communication equipment.  Under the judgment in the case, Emerson’s Artesyn and Astec
units had to pay $14 million of the award and ABB’s Power-One
unit more than $25 million. The companies also were told to pay
additional damages for infringement.  The case is Artesyn Technologies v. SynQor, 13-375.  For more patent news, click here.  Trade  Port-to-Facebook Sales Mission Shows Pacific-Trade Deal Jeopardy  The mounting resistance in the U.S. to a Pacific-region
trade deal can be found in the travel itinerary of its chief
salesman:  Michael Froman .  Over the past week Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative,
has touted the Trans-Pacific Partnership at the Port of Los
Angeles, at Paramount Pictures Corp. studios in  California , a
breakfast hosted by  Facebook Inc. (FB)  in San Francisco and an
“armchair discussion” about trade with Agriculture Secretary
Tom Vilsack at that city’s Commonwealth Club.  As chief negotiators from the 12 nations drafting the
accord meet for discussions in Salt Lake City, Froman today will
make the pitch at two events in Washington, including a lunch
hosted by the World Wildlife Fund, which says the agreement must
have provisions to discourage illegal trade in timber and
animals. The countries negotiating the pact want to reach an
agreement by the year’s end, as opposition from Congress,
consumer groups, automakers and labor unions mounts over a range
of issues.  “What we do in TPP will matter for the global trading
system,” Froman said Nov. 16 after a visit to the Port of Los
Angeles. “Ultimately, TPP can serve as a platform for regional
integration, and support and bolster the multilateral trading
system.”  Republicans in Congress have said President  Barack Obama ’s
administration isn’t doing enough to advance its trade agenda,
including obtaining approval from Congress this year to put the
TPP and other future trade deals on a fast track for
congressional approval without amendment.  The Pacific accord, which would cover a region with about
$28 trillion in annual economic output, would go beyond usual
trade pacts dealing with tariffs and traditional goods like
agriculture. It would establish rules for trade in digital
commerce and include environmental standards and protections for
companies that compete against government-backed businesses.  The other nations involved in the discussions are
 Australia , Brunei,  Canada ,  Chile ,  Japan ,  Malaysia ,  Mexico , New
Zealand,  Peru ,  Singapore  and  Vietnam . The U.S. is also pursuing
a separate free-trade accord with the 28-nation European Union.  The Pacific talks have run into a series of obstacles. The
anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks on Nov. 13 released a 94-page
document said to be a draft of the intellectual-property chapter
of the accord. Froman’s office declined to comment on the
release.  For more, click here.  Copyright  Novelist Loses Copyright Infringement Dispute Over Horror Movie  A plaintiff’s copyright-infringement claim based on alleged
similarities between his psychological-thriller novel and a
defendant’s horror film was appropriately dismissed by the
district court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
held Nov. 13 in an unpublished opinion.  The plaintiff, Daniel Segal, wrote a psychological thriller
about a psychiatrist in California who specializes in regression
therapy -— a form of therapy that looks to traumatic events in
past lives to explain ailments being suffered in a patient’s
current life. One of the patients is believed to be haunted by
the spirit of her identical twin, who died as an infant. The
novel is called “Transfers,” which is also the name of a
subsequent screenplay that was written and registered by Segal.  In 2009, the movie “The Unborn” was released to a
nationwide audience by the defendants. The movie, the Ninth
Circuit said, is “about a Jewish family haunted over
generations by a dybbuk -— that is, an otherworldly spirit from
Jewish mysticism that enters this world through twins.” The
movie, like the novel, also features a set of twins, with one
living and the other dying in infancy.  “Other than the generic plot feature of twins and
hauntings, the selection and sequencing of these works have no
relationship to one another —- identical, fraternal, or
otherwise,” the appeals court said in dismissing the case.  The case is Segal v. Rogue Pictures, 12-55587, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Los Angeles).  For more copyright news, click here.  For trademark news, click here.  To contact the reporter on this story:
