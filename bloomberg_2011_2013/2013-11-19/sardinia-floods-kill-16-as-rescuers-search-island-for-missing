Sixteen people died and more than
2,700 fled their homes after a wave of extreme weather triggered
flooding on the Italian island of Sardinia.  Heavy rain and winds yesterday battered the provinces of
Olbia and Nuoro on the northeast of the island, forcing people
to evacuate flood zones,  the national civil protection agency 
said in a statement on its website. As much as 45 centimeters
(1.5 feet) of rain fell on parts of the island, cutting off
roads and disrupting phone and power service, the agency said.  “The situation is dramatic,” Sardinia Governor Ugo Cappellacci said on SkyTG24 television. The dead included a
Brazilian family of four who drowned when their basement
collapsed and three people whose car was crushed by a bridge
that was struck down near Olbia, SkyTG24 reported.  Premier Enrico Letta’s cabinet declared a state of
emergency for the region, allocating 20 million euros ($27
million) for aid to victims and infrastructure repair, he said
at a press conference in  Rome . One person is still missing, the
civil protection agency said.  The agency has issued a new weather warning for the next 12
to 18 hours, which includes heavy rain, wind gusts and stormy
sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
