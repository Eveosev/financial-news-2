Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K. energy explorer in
Africa and Iraq, rose to a two-year high in London trading after
finding more oil off Nigeria than previously forecast.  Afren climbed 8.1 percent to 161 pence, the highest closing
price since July 2011.  The company more than tripled its estimate of recoverable
oil at the Ogo prospect, drilled with  Optimum Petroleum
Development Ltd.  and  Lekoil Ltd. (LEK) , to 774 million barrels from
202 million barrels. Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil-producing
nation, accounts for most of Afren’s sales, providing it with
cash to invest elsewhere including  South Africa  and Kurdistan.  “The discovery looks to be one of the most important made
in West Africa in recent history and to describe it as
‘transformational’ would not be hyperbole,” Daniel Ekstein, an
analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a report. “Developing the light-oil
phase is likely to be relatively straightforward.”  Afren, which said last month that 2013 production will be
at the upper end of its forecast, has gained 23 percent this
year in London.  “Based on the well data, the partners have identified
volumes in excess of our pre-drill estimates,” Chief Executive
Officer Osman Shahenshah said today in a statement. Drilling at
the prospect has been suspended after the well took a
“hydrocarbon kick,” Afren said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
