Quick: what’s the longest river in the world? The Amazon River carries four times as much water into the ocean as any other river does, but for most of the last century, the Nile was measured as slightly longer—about 4,150 miles long compared to the Amazon’s 4,000 miles. But now the matter has been complicated by a series of recent expeditions to an extinct Andean volcano called Nevado Mismi. Measuring river length is a surprisingly tricky proposition. Where does a river end? The mouth of the Amazon, for example, is a complicated series of channels and estuaries that push so much river water into the ocean that, during the rainy season, one can sail over one hundred miles out to sea, dip a bucket into the waves, and drink fresh water. It's hard to demarcate exactly where the Amazon ends and the Atlantic begins. But the point where a river  begins  can be even harder to pinpoint. If you measure the Mississippi River using its straightest tributary, as the U.S. government officially does, its source is Lake Itasca in Minnesota. But if you use its  longest  tributary, the Missouri, the Mississippi suddenly becomes three times as long. In the case of the Amazon, a 2001 National Geographic Society expedition used GPS to demonstrate that the farthest source of the Amazon was not the Marañon River, as previously believed. Instead, its most distant year-round tributary is a trickle flowing off of one of Nevado Mismi's glaciers, which eventually grows into the Qarwasanta Stream, and from there into the Apurímac River, which flows into the Amazon. By Brazil's latest estimate, that's just enough to put the Amazon over the top, making it 100 miles longer than the Nile. An even more shocking discovery about the Amazon was made in 2006, by geologists studying the speed at which the Amazon carried sediments out to sea. Quite by accident, the scientists found, to their surprise, that the older sediments they found were upstream of their source. They soon realized that, until the Cretaceous Period, the Amazon actually flowed backward, east to west! It wasn't until the Andes Mountains began their rise 100 million years ago that the river reversed course and chose its current direction. More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
