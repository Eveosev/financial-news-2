Iran ’s U.S.-educated Foreign
Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif released a web video on YouTube
defending Iran’s nuclear program, on the eve of his country’s
next round of talks with world powers.  In his English-language  video campaign , Zarif spoke of a
“way forward” to reach an agreement in Geneva.  “For us, nuclear energy is about securing the future of
our children,” Zarif said in the video message on YouTube,
which, like Facebook and Twitter, is illegal and blocked in
Iran. “It was about the Iranian nation moving forward as an
equal in a new realm defined by peace, prosperity, by
progress.”  Talks are scheduled to resume in Geneva tomorrow, with the
aim of reaching a deal that would relieve international
sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.
Iran denies allegations its nuclear energy and medical research
program is a cover to build weapons.  Iran is negotiating the deal with the five permanent United
Nations Security Council members --  China ,  France ,  Russia , the
U.S. and U.K. -- plus  Germany . An initial attempt to clinch a
deal faltered in the last round of talks that ended Nov. 10.  “There is a way forward, a constructive path toward
determining our destiny, to advance to make progress, to make
peace, to go forward,” Zarif said.  The foreign minister regularly posts  comments on Facebook ,
including poetry, accounts of his foreign trips and
negotiations, for his 610,000 followers. He also posts messages
on his Twitter account.  To contact the reporter on this story:
