Starwood Capital  Group, a real
estate investing firm led by  Barry Sternlicht , acquired seven
Swedish shopping centers from a unit of Kooperativa Forbundet
for about 3.9 billion Swedish krona ($590 million).  Starwood, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, partnered with
Stockholm-based minority investor Vencom Property Partners to
buy 205,000 square meters (2.2 million square feet) of retail
space in Sweden’s four largest cities: Stockholm, Gothenburg,
Malmo and Uppsala, according to an e-mailed statement. Three of
the locations include building rights to an additional 70,000
square meters total.  The acquisition marks Starwood Capital’s first in Sweden
since billionaire Sternlicht founded the firm in 1991. Coop,
Sweden’s second-largest supermarket chain, is the anchor tenant
at each location, which are 96 percent leased. Other tenants
include XXL, MediaMarkt, H&M and Systembolaget.  Starwood, which focuses on global real estate, has more
than $29 billion in assets under management. The company said
yesterday it purchased a majority interest in seven regional
malls in the U.S., with 7.9 million square feet of retail space,
from Sydney-based  Westfield Group (WDC)  for $1.6 billion.  Vencom invests in Nordic real estate. Kooperativa Forbundet
is a consumer cooperative that operates grocery stores. Its
property arm KF Fastigheter AB is selling the shopping centers.  German banks  Aareal Bank AG (ARL)  and Helaba jointly arranged
financing. CBRE Group Inc. and Lindahl advised Starwood and
Vencom on the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
