Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen said the central bank will “carefully consider” how to
apply new regulatory standards to insurance companies that fall
under the central bank’s supervision.  The Dodd-Frank Act gives regulators the authority to place
insurance companies and other non-bank financial institutions
under Fed supervision if they are large enough to pose systemic
risk to the financial system. Companies such as New York-based
MetLife Inc. argue that their businesses aren’t suited to bank-like regulation in part because their liabilities are in the
form of policies rather than short-term deposits.  In a written response to questions from Louisiana
Republican Senator David Vitter, Yellen pointed out that Dodd-Frank does not permit regulators to apply minimum capital
requirements that are lower than those for banks.  “The Board continues to carefully consider how to design
capital rules for Board-regulated companies that are insurance
companies,” Yellen wrote in her response.  President  Barack Obama  nominated Yellen last month to serve
as Fed chairman when Ben S. Bernanke’s term ends Jan. 31. Yellen
appeared before the Senate Banking Committee last week in a
hearing on her nomination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
