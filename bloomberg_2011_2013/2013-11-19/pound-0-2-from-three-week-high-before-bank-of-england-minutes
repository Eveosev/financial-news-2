U.K. 10-year bond yields fell to the
lowest level in more than a week as investors awaited
publication tomorrow of minutes of the Bank of England’s
November meeting, which will show how policy makers voted.  Benchmark gilts swung between gains and losses after the
Debt Management Office sold 3.75 billion pounds ($6.04 billion)
of 10-year securities in the first of two sales this week. The
pound was little changed versus the dollar after the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said
Britain’s property market may be facing a bubble, even as it
raised its U.K. growth forecasts. The central bank’s Monetary
Policy Committee kept  interest rates  at a record low on Nov. 7.  “We have the MPC minutes tomorrow where we will see what
the policy discussion was like,” said  Marc Ostwald , a
strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in  London . “The auction
was taken down easily and that’s given the market a bit of a
boost. Gilts have a generally healthy bid to them. The focus now
turns to the next auction on Thursday.”  The U.K. 10-year yield was little changed at 2.72 percent
as of 4:26 p.m. London time, having dropped eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, in the previous five days. It earlier
slid to 2.70 percent, the lowest since Nov. 8. The price of the
2.25 percent bond maturing in September 2023 was at 95.98.  The U.K. sold the securities at an average yield of 2.732
percent, compared with 2.742 percent at an auction on Oct. 3.  Today’s sale will be followed by an auction of 4.75 billion
pounds of debt securities due in 2019 on Nov. 21.  Key Rate  At the  Bank of England ’s most recent meeting, officials
kept the key rate at 0.5 percent and maintained their asset-purchase stimulus  target  at 375 billion pounds.  The nation’s jobless rate is more likely than not to reach
the 7 percent threshold that may prompt policy makers to
consider increasing interest rates in the third quarter of 2015,
the central bank said last week, having previously stated that
it didn’t see that happening until the second quarter of 2016.  Gilts lost 2.7 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped
1 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  declined 2.1 percent.  Sterling fell 0.2 percent to 84 pence per euro. The pound
bought $1.6106 after reaching $1.6149 yesterday, the highest
since Oct. 28.  “We are very bullish on the pound,”  Steven Saywell ,
global head of foreign-exchange strategy at BNP Paribas SA in
London, said in a Bloomberg Television interview today. “We’re
coming from a point where the pound is very cheap.”  Britain’s currency strengthened 2.7 percent in the past
three months, the best performer after the New Zealand and
Australian dollars among 10 developed-market counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose
1 percent, while the greenback dropped 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
