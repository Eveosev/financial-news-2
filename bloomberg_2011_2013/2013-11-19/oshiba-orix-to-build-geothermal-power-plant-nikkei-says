Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and  Orix Corp. (8591)  will
build a small geothermal station in Gifu prefecture, the Nikkei
newspaper said today.  The companies will invest less than 2 billion yen ($20
million) for the plant, which will have as much as 2 megawatts
of capacity, the paper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The plant is expected to start as early as 2015, the Nikkei
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
