Spain  sold 12-month bills at the
lowest yield since at least 2004, years before the start of a
 European debt crisis  that pushed it to the brink of a sovereign
bailout last year.  The Treasury in  Madrid  said it sold 3.71 billion euros ($5
billion) of one-year bills at an average yield of 0.678 percent.
That’s the lowest since the start of the series in 2004. It also
sold 840 million euros of six-month bills. The total amount of
of 4.55 billion euros, exceeding the maximum goal set for the
sale. Demand at the auction was 2.49 times the amount sold.  The euro region’s fourth-largest economy, which emerged
from a two-year recession in the third quarter, is attracting
foreign investors, helping it cover about 96 percent of its mid-and long-term funding plan for the year. Last week euro-area
finance ministers  said  it’s on track to exit in January the aid
program secured for its banks in 2012.  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  rose one basis
point today to 4.08 percent at 11:41 a.m. in Madrid, compared
with a euro-era high of 7.75 percent in July 2012, before
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  first pledged to
support the single currency. The spread with similar German
maturities narrowed to 238 basis points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
