Rubber declined for a second day as
Japan’s currency rebounded from a two-month low against the
dollar, reducing the appeal of yen-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in April on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange lost 1.1 percent to settle at 258.4 yen a kilogram
($2,588 a metric ton). Futures have fallen 15 percent this year.  The dollar weakened against most major peers after Fed Bank
of New York President  William Dudley  said that while he’s
getting “more hopeful” the  U.S. economy  is gaining strength,
policy will probably remain accommodative for a long time.  “The market lost steam as the dollar’s rally against the
yen stalled,” said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research
company JSC Corp. in Tokyo. “Rubber is vulnerable to selling
without support from the  currency market  as supply from
 Southeast Asia  is abundant.”  Futures also dropped after oil in New York slid to a five-month low yesterday, boosting speculation the price of synthetic
rubber will drop, he said. West Texas Intermediate oil for
December delivery traded at $92.88 a barrel.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
added 0.5 percent to close at 19,230  yuan  ($3,157) a ton.
Stockpiles monitored by the bourse expanded 6.1 percent to
163,604 tons last week, the highest level since November 2004.  Thai rubber free-on-board lost 0.3 percent to 78.35 baht
($2.48) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
