The Barack Obama administration is sounding  a bit more upbeat  today on the state of the health insurance exchanges. At the same time, it's also clearly preparing a backup plan: allowing customers to buy policies directly from insurers. Now, the law never forbade direct purchases; it says you can buy a policy off the exchange, as long as it’s either grandfathered from 2010, or in compliance with the new requirements for minimum coverage. But you don’t want to do this if your income qualifies you for a subsidy, because subsidies are only available for policies purchased on the exchanges. Or they  were  only available. Now, the administration seems to be saying that it will allow people to qualify for subsidies for policies purchased direct from insurers: It’s hard to see, however, how this can be legal. The  language  of the statute is quite clear: There is some provision to appoint agents. But the law specifically notes that those agents may not be health insurers: This is not the first time  the administration has suggested that it's going to go against the plain text of the law, either. Why is the administration taking such a careless attitude toward a law it spent a year crafting?  Understanding Health Insurance Exchanges It’s hard to come up with a reason that bodes well. Lawsuits seem inevitable, and unwinnable. At best, the White House is buying some time to try to get things up and working; at worst, it hasn't even thought that far ahead.
