TidalStream Ltd. , a maker of
platforms for tidal-power turbines, is in talks with energy
companies and utilities to test its technology in deeper waters.  TidalStream is seeking to form a partnership next year,
John Armstrong, a director at the London-based company, said in
an interview. It’s talking to turbine makers, marine companies,
shipyards and utilities based in  Europe ,  Asia  and  Canada .  “We’re open to any deal structure,” Armstrong said by
telephone. “Developing deepwater sites will be expensive, so we
want to engage with companies that have the resources needed to
provide that capital and to provide know-how as well.”  The tidal-energy industry is still in its infancy, with
developers working to market their turbines and bring
commercial-scale projects into operation for the first time.
Tidal energy costs about $440 a megawatt-hour, more five times
the cost of coal-fired power, according to Bloomberg estimates.  TidalStream’s platforms can accommodate groups of turbines
at varying water depths. The technology has the potential to cut
the cost of installing turbines by half, according to Armstrong.  “Turbine makers seem to recognize that this is one way to
reduce costs,” he said. “Most of them have been busy solving
the problem of putting turbines in the water, so they are
receptive to the idea of lowering costs and solving the access
and maintenance and installation problems in one go.”  A future partnership may bring TidalStream together with
more than one company, Armstrong said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
