Stocks in Switzerland  slipped, with
the benchmark Swiss Market Index falling from its highest level
in almost six months, as  Adecco SA (ADEN)  and Cie. Financiere Richemont
SA slid, offsetting gains in Sonova Holdings AG.  Adecco, the world’s largest provider of temporary workers,
fell 1.6 percent. Richemont, the owner of the Cartier brand,
retreated 0.9 percent. Sonova advanced 1.1 percent as a report
from Citigroup Inc. said the world’s biggest hearing-aid maker
may be increasing its share of the cochlear implants market.  The  SMI (SMI)  lost 0.5 percent to 8,310.19 at 9:48 a.m. in
Zurich. The measure has surged 22 percent this year, heading for
the biggest annual rally since 2005, as central banks around the
world pledged to leave  interest rates  low for a prolonged
period. The Swiss Performance Index slid 0.5 percent today.  A report today will probably show  investor confidence  in
 Germany , Europe’s largest economy, increased to a four-year high
in November. A gauge of investor and analyst expectations, which
aims to predict economic developments six months in advance,
rose to 54 this month from 52.8 in October, economists predicted
before the ZEW Center for European Economic Research releases
the data at 11 a.m. in Mannheim. That would be the highest
reading since October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
