Gasoline fluctuated in  New York 
before the release of the latest Federal Reserve minutes and of
a report that may show nationwide stockpiles declined.  Futures slid as much as 0.9 percent and rose 0.3 percent.
Minutes from the U.S. central bank’s October meeting may
indicate that policy makers are closer to curtailing monetary
stimulus. A government report may show that  U.S. stockpiles  of
gasoline slipped 300,000 barrels last week, according to the
median estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “We’re seeing volatility ahead of the inventory report
tomorrow and the release of the Fed minutes,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC in Austin,  Texas .
“Some of the movement may be tied to people taking positions
and some is uncertainty on the minutes.”  Gasoline for December delivery rose 0.03 cent to $2.6571 a
gallon at 10:18 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
