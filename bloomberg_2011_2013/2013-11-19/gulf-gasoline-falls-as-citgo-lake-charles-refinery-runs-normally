U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened
after Citgo Petroleum Corp. said its  Lake Charles ,  Louisiana ,
refinery was operating normally and would restart a unit by the
end of the month.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  on the Gulf slumped 1.25
cents to 11.5 cents a gallon below New York Mercantile Exchange
futures at 2:51 p.m. after climbing yesterday to a one-month
high. Conventional, 85.5-octane gasoline, or CBOB, dropped 0.25
cent to a discount of 12.75 cents a gallon, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Citgo’s 440,000-barrel-a-day Lake Charles refinery is
running under normal conditions and expected to return a
reformer to service before December, the company said yesterday.
The “A” reformer shut Nov. 7 when a fire broke out in its
heater, according to the company.  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Lake Charles refinery completed planned
maintenance yesterday, while the company’s Borger, Texas, plant
is expected to wrap up planned work this week. The three sites
have a combined capacity of 825,000 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the Gulf Coast was unchanged at
a discount of 8.63 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , dropped 72 cents to $16.85 a gallon. The  same spread 
based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil, the Gulf Coast benchmark,
fell $1.67 to $13.20 a barrel, the first decline in nine days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
