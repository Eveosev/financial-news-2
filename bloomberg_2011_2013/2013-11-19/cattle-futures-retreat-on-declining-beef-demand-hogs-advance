Cattle futures fell to the lowest
price in almost two weeks on speculation that U.S. beef
production is outpacing demand. Hog prices rose.  Meatpackers processed 119,000 cattle yesterday, a 9.2
percent increase from a week earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  Wholesale beef  dropped 2.5 percent from a
four-month high on Oct. 30 to $2.0056 a pound yesterday,
according to the USDA. Prices also are down from a record
$2.1137 on May 23.  Beef producers are struggling “to convince consumers to
pay record prices” for the meat, Lawrence Kane, a market
adviser for Stewart-Peterson Group in  Yates City ,  Illinois , said
in a telephone interview. “We are also hitting holiday season.
People buy a big turkey or big ham.”  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$1.322 a pound at 10:31 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after touching $1.3215, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Nov. 7.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement declined 0.8
percent to $1.63 a pound.  Hog futures for February settlement rose 0.1 percent to
89.95 cents a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
