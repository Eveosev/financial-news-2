Gold futures may extend a slump and
drop to $1,200 an ounce, the lowest since June, as moving
averages signal a “death cross” according to technical
analysis by by Logic Advisors.  The 50-day moving average has fallen below the 100-day
average for two straight sessions, signaling futures on the
Comex in  New York  may fall as much as 5.7 percent from
yesterday’s settlement of $1,272.30 by the end of the year, said
 Bill O’Neill , a parter at Logic Advisors in  Upper Saddle River ,
 New Jersey .  Gold is heading for the first annual loss since 2000 after
some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value.
Global equities advanced to the highest in almost six years
yesterday, and U.S. inflation is running at 1.2 percent, half
the rate of the past decade. Federal Reserve Bank of New York
President William C. Dudley said yesterday he’s “getting more
hopeful” the  U.S. economy  is gaining strength, fueling concern
the central bank will cut its monetary stimulus.  “The market looks very anemic, and the technicals point
towards more weakness,” O’Neill said in a telephone interview.
“The death cross is another indication that prices will remain
under pressure.”  The death cross forms as a short-term moving average falls
below a long-term measure. Yesterday, the 50-day average was
$1,315.58, and the 100-day measure was $1,319.97. The first
bearish target is $1,250, and the next is $1,200, O’Neill said.
On June 28, prices touched $1,179.40, a 34-month low.  Speculators cut their net-long position in gold by 37
percent to 55,456 futures and options in the week ended Nov. 12,
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show, the biggest
drop since February. Short bets climbed to 54,143, the highest
since mid-August, from 26,490 a week earlier.  Global bullion demand tumbled 21 percent last quarter as
investors pulled 118.7 metric tons out of exchange-traded funds
and similar products, World Gold Council data show.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
