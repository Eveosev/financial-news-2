Canola dropped to a five-week low on
signs that global supplies will increase and on speculation that
demand from Canadian processors will slow because this year’s
record domestic crop has a higher oil content.  Canola plants in  Canada , the world’s largest grower, have
an average  oil content  that’s 1.5 percentage points higher than
a year earlier and exceeds the 10-year average, the Canadian
Grain Commission said Nov. 18. Processors crushed 1.8 million
metric tons of the oilseed this year as of Nov. 13, down from
2.1 million tons a year earlier, according to the Canadian
Oilseed Processors Association.  “Supplies are going to remain very, very abundant here,”
Ken Ball, a senior commodities futures adviser for PI Financial,
said in a telephone interview from Winnipeg. “It could be the
higher oil content means they have to crush a little bit less to
meet their shipping commitment.”  Canola futures for January settlement fell 1 percent to
C$482.20 ($460.77) a ton at 11:37 a.m. on the ICE Futures
Exchange in Winnipeg, after touching C$481, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Oct. 11. The oilseed declined 17
percent this year through yesterday on signs of increasing
production.  Output this season may climb to a record 16 million tons,
exceeding the record of 14.6 million in 2011,  Statistics Canada 
said Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
