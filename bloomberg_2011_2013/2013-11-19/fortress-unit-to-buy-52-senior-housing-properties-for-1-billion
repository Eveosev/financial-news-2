A unit of  Fortress Investment Group
LLC (FIG)  agreed to buy 52 senior-housing properties across the U.S.
from Holiday Acquisition Holdings LLC for $1.01 billion.  Newcastle Investment Corp. (NCT)  will pay for the properties,
which comprise 5,885 units, with about $300 million of equity
and fund the rest of the purchase with non-recourse mortgage
debt, the Fortress affiliate said yesterday in a statement.
Newcastle plans to enter into two master leases with Holiday
affiliates, with the deal expected to close in December,
according to the statement. Rent in the first year will be equal
to 6.5 percent of the purchase price, the company said.  Newcastle, a New York-based real estate investment trust,
focuses its investments on senior housing and real estate debt.  Holiday is majority-owned by private-equity funds managed
by an affiliate of Newcastleâ€™s manager, according to the
statement. The properties included in the proposed deal are
located in 24 states, and had a 91 percent average occupancy at
the end of September.  Separately,  National Health Investors Inc. (NHI) , a health-care
REIT, agreed to acquire 25 independent-living properties from
Holiday for $491 million, the Murfreesboro, Tennessee-based
buyer said in a statement today. The properties have 2,841 units
and had an average occupancy of 89 percent for the nine months
ended Sept. 30.  National Health Investors will offer 4.5 million shares of
its common stock, with proceeds used to fund a portion of the
purchase, the company said today in a separate statement.
Underwriters are likely to have a 30-day option to purchase
675,000 additional shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
