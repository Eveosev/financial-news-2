U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry 
urged the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia to seek progress in
talks over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region as negotiations
resume today in Vienna after a three-year hiatus.  “We are urging that process to move forward, and we will
continue to be engaged in that,” Kerry said yesterday in a
joint  briefing  in Washington with Turkish Foreign Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu . Kerry said he’d spoken by phone with Azeri President
 Ilham Aliyev  and his Armenian counterpart Serzh Sargsyan during
the last three days.  Armenians took over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave
about the size of Rhode Island, and seven adjacent districts
from Azerbaijan in a war after the Soviet Union’s collapse in
1991. More than 30,000 people were killed and over a million
displaced before Russia brokered a cease-fire in 1994.  Azerbaijan, buoyed by more than $40 billion of energy
investments by  BP Plc (BP/)  and partners, has increased military
spending almost 30-fold to $3.7 billion in the last decade.
Aliyev has repeatedly threatened to use force to regain control
of the territory should peace talks mediated by the U.S., Russia
and France fail.  Russia hopes the resumption of talks between Azerbaijan and
Armenia will assist in resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,
Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  told reporters  yesterday 
after meeting his Armenian counterpart Edward Nalbandian.  To contact the reporters on this story:
