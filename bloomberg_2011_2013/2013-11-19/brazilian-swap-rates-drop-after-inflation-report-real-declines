Brazil ’s shorter-term swap rates
fell for a fifth straight day as slower-than-forecast inflation
added to speculation that policy makers will limit increases in
borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015
declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.71
percent at 9:59 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the lowest level since Nov.
5. The real depreciated 0.5 percent to 2.2761 per dollar after
rallying the most in two months yesterday.  “The calmer inflation numbers are bringing down swap
rates,” Paulo Petrassi, of Leme Investimentos, said by phone
from Florianopolis, Brazil.  The national statistics agency reported today that consumer
prices climbed 5.78 percent in the 12 months through mid-November, less than then 5.87 percent median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Brazil has raised the target
lending rate to 9.50 percent from a record low 7.25 percent this
year, the most among 49 nations tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
