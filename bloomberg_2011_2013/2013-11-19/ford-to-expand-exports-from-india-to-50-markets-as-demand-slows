Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest
U.S. automaker, will ship cars made at its India factories to
more overseas markets as it increases capacity to benefit from
the nation’s low manufacturing costs.  The company, which is building a second plant in India,
plans to export cars to 50 markets within five years, up from 37
now, David Schoch, Ford’s head for the Asia-Pacific region, said
in an interview in Taipei yesterday.  The automaker’s annual capacity in the South Asian nation
will increase to 440,000 units after the second plant begins
output. The push to increase exports from its Indian factories
comes as industrywide deliveries in  Asia ’s third-biggest car
market fell 4.6 percent in the seven months through October,
heading for their first annual drop since 2002.  “It’s a low-cost manufacturing hub for exports to other
parts of the Ford growth,” said Schoch, who reiterated comments
made in September that the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker
will step up exports from  India  given the changing local
conditions and growing global demand.  Ford exported 29,316 units, or 27 percent of its production
in India, in the year ended March 31. It sold 77,225 passenger
vehicles in the country that year, giving it a 2.9 percent
market share, according to data from the  Society of Indian
Automobile Manufacturers .  In June, Ford introduced the EcoSport compact SUV in India.
The automaker has a waiting list for 50,000 units of the model
in the country, Schoch said. Ford will unveil the EcoSport in
 Taiwan  today.  The company will increase its dealerships in smaller cities
in China and expects to have 6 percent share of the market by
the end of 2015, Schoch said. Ford will double its factories in
 China  by the end of 2015 to eight, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
