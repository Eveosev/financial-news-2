Construction permits for housing in
 Germany  rose 13.5 percent in the first nine months to the
highest level since 2004.  German authorities issued permits for 202,123 apartments
and houses, up from 178,097 a year earlier, the Federal
Statistics Office said in a statement today. In the first nine
months of 2004, permits were issued for 208,462 homes.  German home construction, recovering from a slump during
the financial crisis, is lagging behind demand in the country’s
largest cities as the number of households increases. The
shortage of homes has prompted government-owned property
companies to build more affordable housing and caused the
Bundesbank to warn of an “imbalance” that’s contributing to
overvaluations.  By 2018, Berlin government-owned landlord  Howoge
Wohnungsbau GmbH  plans to build as many as 1,500 apartments,
while Munich’s Gewofag Holding GmbH will create  3,000 new homes ,
according to their websites.  Demand for housing has also pushed up rents and values.
 Home prices  rose by the most in 10 years in the third quarter,
the VDP Association of German Pfandbrief Banks said on Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
