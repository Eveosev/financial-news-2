  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , China’s second-largest panel maker, returned to profit for the first time in
two years and raised its shipment forecast 11 percent.  Net income in the third quarter was $9.9 million compared
with a loss of $33.7 million the previous quarter and a $57.5
million-loss a year ago, the Changzhou, China-based company said
today in a statement. Revenue rose 24 percent from the previous
quarter.  Most large solar manufacturers are becoming newly
profitable, helped by a surge in demand from Asia and a
stabilization of prices following two years of losses. Peers
 Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)  and  JinkoSolar Holding Co. Ltd. (JKS)  also
reported profit last week.  Trina’s third-quarter panel shipments reached 774.6
megawatts driven by sales in China and Japan, doubling the level
in the same period last year. The company now expects to ship
2.58 gigawatts to 2.62 gigawatts during 2013, higher than the
previous forecast of 2.3 gigawatts to 2.4 gigawatts.  Trina last reported a profit in the second quarter of 2011.
 Yingli Green Energy Holding (YGE)  Co. Ltd. is China’s largest solar
panel maker, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
