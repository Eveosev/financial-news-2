Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said
the extraordinary measures that his department can employ to
avoid hitting the debt ceiling would last for about a month.  Lew, speaking at a conference in  Washington  today, urged
Congress to increase the debt limit “way” in advance of a
February deadline to avoid a situation similar to the one last
month, when the U.S. was close to running out of extraordinary
steps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
