European  stocks  dropped from a five-year high as investors weighed equity valuations that are at the
highest since 2009.  Paddy Power Plc slumped the most in five years after
Ireland’s biggest bookmaker cut its forecast for 2013 profit
growth.  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  fell 2.7 percent as two shareholders sold a
combined 18.8 million shares in the Belgian bank.  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) 
rallied 7.1 percent after announcing a special dividend.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.7 percent to 322.56
at the close of trading in  London . The gauge yesterday jumped to
its highest level since May 2008, extending a six-week rally.
The Stoxx 600 is  trading  at 15.1 times projected earnings,
higher than the 10-year average of 12.1 times earnings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This has been a great year and at some point you might
want to take some risk off the table,” said Teis Knuthsen,
chief investment officer at Saxo Bank A/S’s private banking unit
in Hellerup,  Denmark . “Some investors may want to sell into
year end so the upcoming weeks may be less impressive. Perhaps
one of the healthy signs about this year’s rally is that there’s
a lot of nervousness in the system. Investors have been willing
to pay more, but many people keep saying it isn’t sustainable.”  National benchmark indexes fell in 15 the 18 western
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 dropped 1.1 percent and
 Germany ’s DAX slipped 0.4 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 decreased
0.4 percent.  Global Growth  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
cut its global growth forecasts for this year and the next. The
world economy will probably expand 2.7 percent this year and 3.6
percent next year, down from its May predictions of 3.1 percent
and 4 percent respectively, the Paris-based OECD said.  The  Federal Reserve  will release minutes of its October
policy meeting tomorrow. The document will reveal more details
behind the decision to press on with $85 billion in monthly
asset purchases. Fed policy makers will probably pare that pace
to $70 billion at their March 18-19 meeting, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Paddy Power (PWL)  dropped 8.1 percent to 57.44 euros in Dublin
after saying that poor takings from sports gambling will reduce
earnings more than originally expected. Operating profit in
constant currencies will increase by a low-to-mid single-digit
percentage in 2013, down from a previous guidance for double-digit growth, the company said.  Ladbrokes Plc and William Hill Plc fell 1.8 percent to 175
pence and 2 percent to 361.3 pence, respectively.  KBC Stake  KBC lost 2.7 percent to 39.60 euros. Shareholders KBC
Ancora CVA and Cera CVBA sold the shares at about 39.15 euros
apiece. Cera offered 14.1 million shares, more than half of its
stake in KBC, while KBC Ancora sold 4.7 million shares.  Intertek Group Plc, a product-inspection services provider,
slid 2.5 percent to 3,102 pence. The company said revenue
excluding acquisitions increased 3 percent in the July-to-October period, down from 6.3 percent in the first half.  EasyJet advanced 7.1 percent to 1,345 pence.  Europe ’s
second-biggest discount carrier proposed to pay 44.1 pence (71
cents) per share, in addition to a regular  dividend  of 33.5
pence. Pretax profit for the 12 months to Sept. 30 rose 51
percent to 478 million pounds, topping the 476 million-pound
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Royal KPN NV climbed 1.4 percent to 2.48 euros as Credit
Suisse Group AG raised its rating on the phone company to
outperform, which is similar to buy, from neutral. Credit Suisse
predicted the stock will gain in value once the sale of KPN’s
German business to Telefonica SA is completed.  Afren Plc jumped 8.1 percent to 161 pence, its highest
price since July 2011, after more than trebling its estimate for
recoverable oil from the Ogo prospect off the coast of  Nigeria .
Afren has a 40 percent stake in the project. Partner Lekoil Ltd,
which owns a 30 percent stake, surged 20 percent to 59.5 pence.  The number of shares trading hands today in Stoxx 600-listed companies was 26 percent lower than the average of the
past 30 sessions, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
