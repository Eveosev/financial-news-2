OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s
largest wireless carrier, boosted third-quarter earnings as it
added subscribers in Moscow and Ukraine and surpassed its main
rival in data revenue.  Operating income before depreciation and amortization rose
4.5 percent from a year earlier to 46.3 billion rubles ($1.4
billion), Moscow-based MTS said today in a statement. Analysts
 predicted  46.1 billion rubles, the average of estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 4 percent to 103.4 billion rubles,
compared with the average projection of 103.9 billion rubles.  MTS, controlled by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov, is
adding subscribers by offering cheaper smartphones and contracts
bundling Web service and voice. The products helped MTS’s data
revenue top that of billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ’s  OAO MegaFon. (MFON)   Data revenue in Russia increased 45 percent to 12.5 billion
rubles as MTS’s customers spent more browsing the Internet and
sending e-mail. MegaFon boosted data revenue 24 percent in the
period to 12.4 billion rubles. Billionaire  Mikhail Fridman ’s
 VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  increased third-quarter data sales in Russia 30
percent, growing from a lower base.  Sales will increase at least 5 percent this year, MTS said.
It previously projected sales growth of 5 percent to 7 percent.
The company cited a slowing Russian economy for the changed
forecast.  MTS shares fell 0.5 percent to 327.55 rubles at 3:48 p.m.
in Moscow. They had  gained  34 percent this year through
yesterday.  The company had 99.9 million users of as Sept. 30, up 6.3
percent from a year earlier. Customers increased 11.5 percent in
Ukraine and 7.5 percent in the Moscow region, MTS said  Nov. 15 .
Users more than doubled in Turkmenistan, where MTS resumed
service last year.  The operator’s Oibda margin widened to 44.8 percent in the
third quarter from 44.5 percent a year earlier. MegaFon’s Oibda
margin was 45.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
