The yield on  India ’s 10-year
government bonds held near a three-month high amid concern an
accelerating inflation would prompt further increases in
 interest rates  by the central bank.  Wholesale prices  rose 7 percent in October from a year
earlier, the fastest pace since February, while  consumer-price
inflation  accelerated to 10.09 percent, separate reports showed
last week. The  Reserve Bank  of India will study data, including
food prices and exchange-rate depreciation, before deciding
whether to raise the benchmark rate for a third straight
meeting, Governor  Raghuram Rajan  said Nov. 13. The RBI said
yesterday it will auction new 10-year debt on Nov. 22.  “Trade is likely to be range-bound as there are no
immediate triggers” until the next policy review, said
Srinivasa Raghavan, Mumbai-based executive vice-president of
treasury at Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. “The current 10-year bond may
become slightly illiquid” after new notes are issued, he said.
He sees the yield between 8.80 percent and 9.20 percent until
the next RBI meeting on Dec. 18.  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 slid one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, from Nov. 14 to 9.01
percent in Mumbai today, according to prices from the central
bank’s trading system. Trade in the 7.16 percent notes resumed
after a two-session break. Indian financial markets were shut
Nov. 15 and trading in the 2023 securities was suspended
yesterday because of semi-annual interest payments, according to
Development Credit Bank Ltd. and IDBI Bank Ltd.  The rate climbed to 9.05 percent on Nov. 12, the highest
since Aug. 19, after the wholesale-price inflation data was
released. The yield on the 8.28 percent notes due September 2027
fell 10 basis points from yesterday to 8.99 percent today.  Softening Yields  The rise in government bond yields is “temporary,”
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters in
Mumbai today. He said he hopes inflation will ease soon and that
the central bank will take steps to soften yields.  The RBI bought 61.57 billion rupees ($990 million) of four
securities maturing between 2015 and 2025 at an open-market
auction yesterday. Rajan had announced a plan to buy as much as
80 billion rupees of debt at a Nov. 13  press conference .  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points to 8.57 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
