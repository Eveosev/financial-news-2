JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon , who reached a $13 billion settlement to
resolve mortgage-bond disputes, said he was surprised by costs
tied to the purchase of Bear Stearns Cos.  “It was a house on fire, it was imploding,” Dimon said
today on a conference call when asked about how he views the
2008 acquisition. “We did it because we were asked to. We never
expected this kind of stuff to happen.”  JPMorgan, now the biggest U.S. lender by assets, completed
its rescue of Bear Stearns after the Federal Reserve agreed to
take control of a $30 billion portfolio of mortgage-linked
assets. Today’s deal includes costs tied to Bear Stearns,
JPMorgan said. Dimon, 57, declined to provide specifics about
New York-based JPMorgan’s returns on the 2008 deal.  “We’ll do a post-mortem later,” he said. “We’re just
trying to get the stuff resolved for now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
