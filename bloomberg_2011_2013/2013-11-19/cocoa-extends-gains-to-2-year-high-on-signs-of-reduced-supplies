3.55 million bags, the lowest since Dec. 8, 2011.  Cocoa for March delivery jumped 0.2 percent to $2,785 a
metric ton by 4:05 a.m. on ICE Futures in  New York , and earlier
today gained to $2,792, the highest for a most-active contract
since Sept. 16, 2011. Prices advanced 24 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
