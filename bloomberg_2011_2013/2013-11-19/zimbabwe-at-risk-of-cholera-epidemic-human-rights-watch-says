Millions of people in Harare,
 Zimbabwe ’s capital, are at risk of getting cholera, five years
after an epidemic of the waterborne disease killed more than
4,000 people in the country, according to Human Rights Watch.  Residents have little access to drinkable water and
sanitation services, Human Rights Watch said in a  report 
released on the group’s website today.  “Harare’s water and sanitation system is broken and the
government isn’t fixing it,” Tiseke Kasambala, Southern Africa
director at Human Rights Watch, said in the report. “In many
communities there is no water for drinking or bathing, there is
sewage in the streets, there is diarrhea and typhoid and the
threat of another cholera epidemic.”  The government should invest in low-cost sanitation and
water strategies to improve the quality of water and sanitation
in the capital, according to Human Rights Watch, a non-profit,
non-governmental human-rights organization based in New York.  Zimbabwe’s National Water Authority, the Ministry of Water
Resource Development and Management and the Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare weren’t immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
