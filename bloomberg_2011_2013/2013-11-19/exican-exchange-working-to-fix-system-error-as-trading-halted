Mexico ’s stock exchange said it’s
working to correct a communication glitch that has led to a
trading halt for most of the day.  The exchange said in a statement at about noon in Mexico
City that it has a “problem in its system of communications
with some brokerages.” Trading was suspended for a so-called
administrative recess at 8:54 a.m., 24 minutes after the opening
bell.  The benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican stocks was down 0.7
percent to 40,752.84 when trading stopped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
