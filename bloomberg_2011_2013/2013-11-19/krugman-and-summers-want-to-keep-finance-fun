Here is an intriguing  Federal Reserve discussion paper  that finds that efficient markets are bad. 1  Or, specifically, it argues -- based on a theoretical model that seems to fit a big data sample of actual stocks -- that  equity misvaluation  is good for companies, because it allows them to time the market in making financing decisions. So when a company knows its stock is overvalued, based on its own knowledge of its cash flows and prospects etc., it will issue stock and build up a cash reserve; when it is undervalued it will buy back stock.  Overall, the model predicts that these effects will cause companies to raise more cash, and invest more of it, more productively, than would a market with no equity misvaluation. So markets that sometimes get pricing wrong increase productive investment. They also increase shareholder value by about 8 percent. That's sort of weird. In my former life I helped companies issue and buy back equity and let us say I did not notice any strong trend towards buying low and selling high. 2  But I guess it's possible? It's particularly interesting today after this weekend's economics-blogger brouhaha over  Larry Summers's IMF speech . 3  Summers argued that we might be in a new normal of negative real interest rates, rather than a temporary crisis, and that we need new ways of thinking about the zero lower bound as a long-term state of affairs.  Among other things, that might require revisiting the idea that financial prudence is, y'know, good. Paul Krugman's  important post  on the speech characterizes Summers's view as being that "we may be an economy that needs bubbles just to achieve something near full employment" and "that even improved financial regulation is not necessarily a good thing -- that it may discourage irresponsible lending and borrowing at a time when more spending of any kind is good for the economy." 4  In 2006, one thing that I guess you could think, is that the American financial industry was big and rich and arrogant because it was really good at allocating capital, and because allocating capital is a really important business. In 2013, the importance of capital allocation is if anything even more obvious, but it's a lot harder to be confident that the financial industry is really good at it. Mistakes, you may recall, were made. How do you respond to that? "We've learned our lesson and are much better now, nothing to see here, thanks for your concern," is not a particularly compelling thing to say, whether or not it is true. "Finance should be tightly regulated, boring, and utility-like, so it cannot blow us up again" has  considerably more intuitive appeal , though it is  troublesome to put into practice . It is also, well, boring, and drab, and bad for the old self-esteem. It also might be wrong, is the thing. You might need bubbles. You might need equity misvaluation. Messing things up may be an important, useful function of the financial system. Of course, this complex of arguments around the idea that finance  has  to be inefficient, irresponsible, bubbly, uncontrolled, in order to do its job --  that  is an idea that I can get behind! It's fun. It doesn't consign finance to the role of boring utility; it encourages creativity and excitement and risk-taking and oh sure sometimes stupidity. It tears bankers down from their stature as Masters of the Universe, but it leaves them a glorious place as inspired vessels of inscrutable and wild powers beyond the ken of man. Under the circumstances that is not a bad trade.
