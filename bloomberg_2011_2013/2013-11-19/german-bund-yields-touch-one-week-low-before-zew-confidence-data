German bonds declined, snapping an
advance that pushed 10-year yields to the lowest in almost two
weeks, as a report showed investor confidence in Europe’s
largest economy increased to a four-year high this month.  Italian 10-year yields dropped to the least since Nov. 7 as
optimism the economic recovery in the euro area is spreading
boosted demand for higher-yielding  government securities . Spain
sold one-year debt at the lowest yield since Bloomberg started
collecting the data in 2004, while the European Stability
Mechanism, the euro area’s firewall fund, also sold bills.  “In terms of the expectations, the ZEW was slightly
bearish for German bonds,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Corp. in  London . “It’s back at a
level we haven’t seen for a while so there’s encouragement
there. Unless something unexpected happens we think we are going
to be rangebound between now and the end of the year.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yield rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.72 percent at 4:55 p.m. London time,
after dropping three basis points yesterday. The rate earlier
fell to 1.68 percent, the lowest since Nov. 7. The 2 percent
bond maturing in August 2023 declined 0.36, or 3.60 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,352) face amount, to 102.48.  Spain’s 10-year yield rose one basis point to 4.09 percent
after the nation sold 3.71 billion euros of 12-month bills to
yield 0.678 percent.  Italy ’s 10-year yield was at 4.07 percent.  Fragile Recovery  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, rose to
54.6, the highest since October 2009, and up from 52.8 last
month. The median prediction of 40 economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for an increase to 54.  A composite gauge of euro-region manufacturing and services
activity rose to 52 this month from 51.9 in October, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts before the data is
released on Nov. 21. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. The
European Commission in Brussels will say the same day that euro-area  consumer confidence  improved in November, according to a
separate survey.  Europe’s economic recovery remains fragile with inflation
expectations “solidly anchored,” European Central Bank policy
maker Peter Praet said today at the Euro Finance Week event in
 Frankfurt . He said in an interview published on Nov. 13 that the
ECB would consider all options to ensure  price stability , and
asset purchases are a potential option if needed.  The central bank cut its main refinancing rate to 0.25
percent on Nov. 7.  ECB Options  ECB Policy makers haven’t exhausted their options to
counter low inflation, Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen
said in an interview broadcast on Austria’s ORF radio.  “While I’d be very careful with such an instrument” as
negative  interest rates , he said, “I don’t want to
fundamentally exclude it.”  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of France and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  German  government bonds  lost 1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
returned 11 percent and Italy’s earned 7.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
