Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  swung between gains and losses as investors weighed
falling stockpiles in  China  against higher steel production.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract by volume
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, earlier rose as much as 0.5
percent and fell as much as 0.2 percent before trading at 3,599
yuan ($591) a metric ton by 11:14 a.m. local time. The contract
fell 1.9 percent last week.  Rebar inventory  tracked by Shanghai Steelhome Information
Technology Co. dropped to 5.31 million tons last week, the
lowest since January 2011. China is the world’s biggest consumer
and producer of steel.  China’s daily crude steel output averaged 2.14 million tons
in the first 10 days of November, up 2.2 percent from late
October, industry consultancy Mysteel.com reported yesterday,
citing data from the China Iron and Steel Association. The steel
output gain will pressure prices if demand doesn’t pick up,
according to the report.  Iron ore for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
rose 0.4 percent to 936  yuan  a ton. The steel-making  material
 for immediate delivery at Tianjin port tracked by The Steel
Index gained 0.2 percent to $137 a dry ton yesterday.  Rebar for immediate delivery tracked by Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. was little changed at 3,540 yuan a
ton yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
