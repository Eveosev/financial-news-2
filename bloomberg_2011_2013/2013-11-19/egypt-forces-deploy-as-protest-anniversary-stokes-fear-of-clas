Egyptian security forces deployed
across Cairo and in  Tahrir Square  as planned rallies to
commemorate a deadly demonstration two years ago against then-President  Hosni Mubarak  raised fears of new violence.  Ahead of preparations for today’s anniversary of the
killing of at least 45 people in clashes with security forces in
Mohamed Mahmoud Street and Tahrir Square, several protesters
spray painted the foundation for a monument being erected to
honor those slain during protests since 2011.  Youth groups argue that the monument, whose cornerstone was
laid yesterday by interim Prime Minister Hazem El Beblawi, is an
affront to the memory of those killed because the security
forces haven’t been held accountable for the violence.  The deployment of the security forces underscored the
tensions that prevail as the interim administration presses
ahead with its plan to restore democratic government after the
military ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi,  Egypt ’s first
freely elected president, in July. The  Interior Ministry  said
its forces were on high alert in preparation for the rallies,
according to Al-Hayat television.  Youth groups and Islamist supporters say Defense Minister
Abdelfatah al-Seesi, who led the ouster of Mursi, of controlling
the current interim administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
