A unit of  Fortress Investment Group
LLC (FIG)  agreed to acquire 52 U.S. senior-housing properties from
Holiday Acquisition Holdings LLC for about $1.01 billion.  Newcastle Investment Corp. will pay for the properties,
which comprise 5,885 units, with about $300 million of equity
and fund the remainder of the purchase with non-recourse
mortgage debt, the Fortress affiliate said today in a statement.
Newcastle intends to enter into two master leases with Holiday
affiliates, with the deal expected to close in December,
according to the statement. Rent in the first year will be equal
to 6.5 percent of the purchase price, it said.  The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is weighing whether to
narrow the legal definition of real estate for the purposes of
converting to a real estate investment trust amid a recovery in
U.S. property values. Newcastle focuses its investments on
senior housing and real estate debt, and conducts its operations
to qualify as a REIT, according to the statement.  Holiday is majority-owned by private-equity funds managed
by an affiliate of Newcastleâ€™s manager, according to the
statement. The properties included in the proposed deal are
located in 24 states, and had a 91 percent average occupancy as
of Sept. 30, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
