(Corrects story originally published Nov. 18 to remove
reference to asset sales in first and third paragraphs.)  Corp Group Banking SA, one of the
holding companies through which billionaire Alvaro Saieh
controls lender Corpbanca, said a key debt ratio fell to a level
that bars it from taking on new debt.  Corp Group Banking reported a collateralization ratio of
1.42 at the end of the third quarter for $500 million of dollar
bonds due in 2023, below a minimum requirement of 1.75,
according to a filing posted today on the website of  Chile ’s
securities regulator. The ratio measures total unconsolidated
assets, which reached 348 billion pesos ($672 million) at the
end of the period, divided by unguaranteed debt, which stood at
245 billion pesos, the filing says.  Corp Group is restricted from certain kinds of new debt
while the ratio is below 1.75, according to the prospectus of
the bonds sold in January. The breach also restricts payments to
its controller, today’s filing said.  An press relations office that represents Corp Group didn’t
immediately respond to a call for comment.  Corp Group’s main asset is a 45 percent stake in Corpbanca,
Chile’s fifth-largest lender by assets. Corpbanca shares fell 12
percent from July 11 to Aug. 28, after SMU SA, which is also
controlled by Saieh, announced a breach of debt covenants and a
restatement of first quarter earnings.  The shares, which ended the third quarter at 5.40 pesos,
have increased 20 percent since then to 6.48 pesos.  To contact the reporters on this story:
