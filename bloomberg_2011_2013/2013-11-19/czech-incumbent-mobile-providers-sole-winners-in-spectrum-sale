The Czech Republic’s three incumbent
mobile operators won new frequencies allowing them to offer 4G
next-generation services in a tender that failed in its main
goal of bringing a new competitor to the market.  The Czech Telecommunication Office said T-Mobile Czech
Republic AS, Vodafone Czech Republic, and Telefonica Czech
Republic AS -- in which Czech billionaire  Petr Kellner ’s PPF
Group has agreed to buy a majority -- won frequency blocks in
the 800 MHz range in a tender that would bring 8.5 billion
koruna ($421 million) to the country’s 2014 budget.  The regulator, known as CTU, wanted the sale to improve
services and bring investment and new competition in the local
market, long dominated by the three large telecommunications
providers, by allocating a frequency band to a new entrant. The
spectrum will allow operators to join the global trend of
offering Long Term Evolution, or LTE, technology that will let
consumers shop online and stream data faster.  “Despite the fact the fact that CTU created ideal
conditions for a third operator to enter the market, both new
interested parties, in the end, decided not to join the Czech
mobile market,” CTU said in a statement on its website.  Telefonica and T-Mobile bought two 800 MHz blocks each for
2.4 billion koruna and 2.2 billion koruna, respectively.
Vodafone bought one 800 MHz block for 2.7 billion koruna. Each
of the three companies also bought spectrum in the 1,800 and
2,600 MHz bands, CTU said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
