Crude options volatility slipped as
the underlying futures advanced.  Implied volatility for at-the-money January options, a

down from 17.87 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate for January delivery added 21 cents
to settle at $93.89 a barrel on the Nymex. WTI crude for
December delivery rose 31 cents to $93.34.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for 54
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most-active
options were March $100 calls, which rose 2 cents to $1.30 a
barrel with 2,138 lots trading as of 3:10 p.m. March $90 puts
rose 1 cent to $2.06 on volume of 2,102.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 57 percent of
the 73,620 lots traded. January $90 puts rose 5 cents to 68
cents a barrel on 5,854 contracts. January $100 calls declined
12 cents to 17 cents on volume of 3,442 lots.  Open interest yesterday was highest for June $80 puts, with
