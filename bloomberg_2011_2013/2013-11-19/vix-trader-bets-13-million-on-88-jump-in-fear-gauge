An investor bought $13 million in
 call options  on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index, betting the gauge will rally at least 88 percent in the
next four months.  About 100,000 VIX March calls were purchased with a strike
price of 23 for about $1.30 each, according to Trade Alert LLC.
The contracts were among the five most-traded on U.S. options
exchanges today, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  In another transaction, a person spent $5.1 million in a
bet that the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will rise more than 10
percent in the next three months. The trade involved buying
about 31,000 February calls for about $1.65 per contract with an
exercise price of 1,975 on the U.S. equity benchmark, according
to Trade Alert.  “The  S&P 500 (SPX)  trade looks like a melt-up trade and the VIX
trade is the melt-down trade,” Justin Golden, a partner at Lake
Hill Capital Management LLC, said in an e-mail. The New York-based hedge fund trades options on equity indexes and
commodities. “Either way, in order for either of these to pay
off you need significant movement in some direction.”  The two trades -- one that makes money with higher
volatility, the other profiting with equity gains -- show
seemingly opposing wagers on the direction of the  stock market 
as investors gauge the prospect of continued monetary stimulus
after a four-year  bull market . The transactions may be used to
speculate on the direction of the  VIX (VIX)  or  S&P 500 , or to hedge
swings in other investments.  ‘More Hopeful’  The S&P 500 is up 25 percent this year, putting it on track
for the biggest annual gain since 2003, as the  Federal Reserve 
maintained bond purchases to spur economic growth and corporate
earnings topped analysts’ estimates. Investors may see political
turmoil over the next three months as Congress’s self-imposed
deadline to agree on a fiscal 2014 budget comes next month and
the law now funding the government expires Jan. 15.  The S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,789.25 at 3:32 p.m. in
New York. The VIX, which moves in opposite direction of the
equity gauge about 80 percent of the time, gained 2.1 percent to
13.38. The VIX was about 12.9 when the calls were purchased this
morning.  ‘Real Money’  It’s possible that the trades were done by the same firm,
according to Neil Azous of Rareview Macro LLC.  “The less obvious conclusion is that a very large real
money investor purchased both equity and volatility upside,
based on the argument that we may see higher U.S. equities and
higher volatility in 2014,” Azous, founder of the  Stamford ,
Connecticut-based advisory and research firm, said in an
interview. “That could happen as we exit the current monetary
environment, while world economic growth continues to improve,
putting upward pressure on bond yields and stress on  emerging
markets .”  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
cut its global growth forecasts for this year and next as
emerging-market economies including India and  Brazil  cool. The
world economy will probably expand 2.7 percent this year and 3.6
percent next year, instead of the 3.1 percent and and 4 percent
predicted in May, the Paris-based OECD said today.  Another large VIX trade today suggests an investor is
wagering the volatility gauge may climb above 21 in the next
three months. In a strategy known as a call spread, about
100,000 VIX February 20 calls were bought and the same number of
February 28 calls were sold, according to New York-based Trade
Alert.  The trade, which cost $10.4 million, will profit if the
volatility gauge rises above 21.04 by the expiration, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. It has a maximum payoff if the VIX
jumps 114 percent to 28 from yesterday’s close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
