Royal KPN NV (KPN)  reached a tentative
settlement to end litigation claiming a joint venture between
the Dutch phone company and Qwest Communications International
Inc. that went bankrupt in 2002 was mismanaged.  KPN, which is partly owned by America Movil SAB, will pay
50 million euros ($68 million) in cash as part of an agreement
to resolve a three-year-old civil suit brought by KPNQwest
trustees alleging the venture was poorly run, the Hague-based
company said in a statement today.  KPNQwest built a 60-city phone and Internet network just
before prices for telecommunications services collapsed, pushing
it into bankruptcy. The trustees sued KPN, Denver-based Qwest --
which was bought by CenturyLink Inc. in 2011 -- and some former
KPNQwest directors, claiming total damages of 2.2 billion euros.  Qwest, which served customers including AOL Inc., Deutsche
Telekom AG and Dell Inc. through Europe’s largest fiber-optic
network, had to sell the 25,000-kilometer system off in pieces
after failing to find a buyer for the whole business. Former
Qwest Chief Executive Officer Joseph Nacchio was convicted of
insider trading in 2007.  CenturyLink Inc. (CTL) , the Monroe, Louisiana-based
telecommunications company that bought Qwest in 2011 for $24
billion, also agreed to the tentative agreement. The total
settlement, if confirmed, would reach 260 million euros, KPN
said today.  KPN rose 1.6 percent to 2.48 euros as 10:40 a.m. in
Amsterdam, valuing the company at 10.6 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
