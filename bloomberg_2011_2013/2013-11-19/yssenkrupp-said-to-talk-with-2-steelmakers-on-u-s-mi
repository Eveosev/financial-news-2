ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  is in talks to sell
its Alabama plant to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo
Metal Corp., who have teamed up in a joint bid, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  The companies aim to reach an agreement in the coming
weeks, though the discussions could still fall apart, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations
are private. Essen, Germany-based ThyssenKrupp said yesterday in
a statement it’s in exclusive talks for the plant’s potential
sale and it delayed publishing full-year earnings until Dec. 2.  The German steelmaker had been in discussions to sell the
Alabama plant and a Brazilian steel mill to Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA, people familiar with the matter said in September.
ThyssenKrupp was considering keeping the Brazilian plant because
the bids it received were too low, the people said at the time.
The Alabama site may fetch about $1.5 billion, the people said
at the time.  A spokesman for Luxembourg-based  ArcelorMittal (MT)  and Robin Zimmermann, a spokesman for Essen-based ThyssenKrupp, declined
to comment on the sale. Tsuyoshi Yoshizumi, a Tokyo-based
spokesman at Nippon Steel, also declined to comment.  The U.S. and Brazilian plants, which comprise
ThyssenKrupp’s Americas unit, cost almost $12 billion to build.
After a series of writedowns following a slump in steel prices,
the segment now has a book value of 3.4 billion euros ($4.6
billion). ThyssenKrupp is projected to report a third straight
annual net loss amid its unprofitable steel investments in the
Americas and after bribery and price-fixing scandals.  Supply Accord  Reuters reported yesterday that ThyssenKrupp may seek to
raise capital, citing two unidentified bankers familiar with the
matter.  The mill complex in  Rio de Janeiro  has an annual crude-steel capacity of 5 million metric tons. The Alabama plant has
capacity to produce hot-rolled, cold-rolled and coated sheet
steel. ThyssenKrupp said yesterday that the talks for the sale
of the Alabama plant include a long-term contract for the supply
of steel slab produced in  Brazil .  ThyssenKrupp dropped 0.1 percent to 19.40 euros in
Frankfurt yesterday and have advanced 9.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
