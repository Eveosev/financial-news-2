Africa  faces costs to adapt to the
effects of climate change that will rise to $350 billion a year
by the 2070s if governments fail to rein in runaway emissions,
according to a report today from the UN Environment Program.  The costs of adapting Africa’s infrastructure to the rising
seas and stronger storms caused by global warming will likely
total $7 billion to $15 billion by 2020 and “rise rapidly”
thereafter because of ever-higher temperatures, UNEP said today
in a report released at  UN climate talks  in Warsaw.  Envoys in the Polish capital are trying to craft by 2015 a
new agreement binding all nations to limit greenhouse gas
emissions from 2020, with the ultimate goal of limiting the
temperature rise since industialization to 2 degrees Celsius
(3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).  “Missing the 2-degree Celsius window will not only cost
governments billions of dollars but will risk the lives and
livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people on the African
continent and elsewhere,” UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner
said in an e-mailed statement.  Adaptation costs and losses may total as much as 4 percent
of the continent’s economic output by 2100 if the planet remains
on a track to warm by 4 degrees Celsius, according to the
report. Without adaptation measures, damages would total 7
percent of gross domestic product, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
