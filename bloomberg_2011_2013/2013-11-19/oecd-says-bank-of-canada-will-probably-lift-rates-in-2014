The  Bank of Canada  will probably
raise its benchmark lending rate at the end of next year to
avoid a build-up of inflation, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.  The first increase in the  1 percent rate  since 2010 is
projected to be in the fourth quarter of 2014, with the central
bank raising it to 2.25 percent by the end of 2015, the OECD
said in its world economic outlook released today.  “With spare capacity narrowing by the end of 2015,
monetary policy tightening may need to begin by late 2014 to
avoid a build-up of inflationary pressures,” the Paris-based
organization said in the report.  Investors have been paring bets on higher borrowing costs
after Governor Stephen Poloz unexpectedly dropped the central
bank’s rate-increase bias at its last announcement Oct. 23,
citing greater slack in the economy. Investors were pricing in
fewer than 5 basis points of increases by Dec. 2014, according
to swaps trading in Toronto at 12 p.m. yesterday, down from 11
basis points a month earlier and 26 basis points Sept. 18.  After an initial burst following the recession,  Canada ’s
economy began to slow last year amid weak global demand for its
goods and a slump in business investment. Canada’s economy will
expand at a 1.7 percent pace this year, the same as in 2012,
before accelerating to 2.3 percent in 2014 and 2.6 percent in
2015, the OECD predicted.  Average growth across the 34 countries in the OECD will be
2.3 percent in 2014 and 2.7 percent in 2015, the organization
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
