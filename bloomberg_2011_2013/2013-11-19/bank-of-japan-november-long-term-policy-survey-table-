Thirty-five out of 37 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News doubt the BOJ will reach its price stability goal of
around 2% inflation by the end of fiscal 2015, with 22 economists seeing
the central bank modifying or abandoning this target at some point.  All economists agree there will be no policy changes at this weekâ€™s
meeting. Nineteen of those surveyed predict an expansion of monetary
stimulus from April to June of next year. The government will increase
the sales tax in April 2014.  NOTE 1: 2H = 2nd half of the year
