Infineon Technologies AG (IFX) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest semiconductor maker, said it plans to spend about
300 million euros ($405 million) repurchasing stock a week after
predicting a decline in profitability.  The amount will allow Infineon to buy back about 42 million
shares, or 4 percent of its share capital, through direct
repurchases of issuance of put options on the stock, the
Neubiberg, Germany-based company said in a statement today.  The stock  rose  as much as 2.8 percent, erasing earlier
losses today in Frankfurt trading. Last week, Infineon, whose
revenue trails  STMicroelectronics NV (STM) , said its operating profit
margin in the current quarter will shrink to as little as 8
percent from 14.1 percent in the previous thee-month period.  The chipmaker is pioneering production from larger-diameter
wafers, which Infineon has said will help it manufacture 2.5
times as many chips from each slice. Increasing production in
Dresden, of chips cut from 300-millimeter silicon wafers means
that reaching Infineon’s target for a 15 percent profit margin
will take some time, the company said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
