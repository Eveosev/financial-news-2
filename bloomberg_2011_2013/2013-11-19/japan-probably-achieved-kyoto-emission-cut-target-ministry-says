Japan  probably achieved an 8.2
percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions in fiscal 2008 to 2012
compared with 1990 levels, the Ministry of the Environment said.  The cut was above the 6 percent-reduction target set under
the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the ministry said in a  statement 
today, citing preliminary figures.  The country emitted 1.341 billion metric tons in fiscal
2012, the ministry said. That’s an increase of 6.3 percent
compared with 1990 levels, and also 2.5 percent higher than the
previous year. Japan’s fiscal year starts in April.  An increase in use of fossil fuels after the Fukushima
disaster in 2011 forced the closure of nuclear plants
contributed to the rise in emissions, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
