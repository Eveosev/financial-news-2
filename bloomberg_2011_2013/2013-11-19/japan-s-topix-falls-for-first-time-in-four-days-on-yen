Japan ’s  Topix index  fell, headed for
its first drop in four days, as the yen strengthened below 100
per dollar and insurers and glassmakers led losses.  The Topix slid 0.2 percent to 1,238.79 as of 9:04 a.m. in
 Tokyo , with all but four of its 33 industry groups declining.
The gauge climbed 3.1 percent in the previous three days,
bringing it within 2.7 percent of its highest close this year on
May 22. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average retreated 0.3 percent today
to 15,114.84, having last week jumped 7.7 percent for its
biggest weekly advance since 2009. The yen strengthened 0.1
percent to trade at 99.89 per dollar.  “Markets have risen at a sharp pace so we could easily see
some profit-taking,” said Hiroaki Hiwada, a Tokyo-based
strategist at Toyo Securities Co. “But the upwards trend will
continue. It’s only a matter of time before markets surpass
their May highs.”  The Nikkei 225 surged 80 percent from November 2012 to its
highest close in 5 1/2 years on May 22 amid bets Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe and the Bank of Japan will lead the country out of
deflation. The gauge then slumped 20 percent through June 13 to
enter a bear market, before recovering to close last week at its
highest since the May peak.  As earnings season draws to a close, net income doubled at
more than 1,280 of the country’s largest listed non-financial
firms, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies that
made tough decisions about exiting businesses, closing factories
and revamping management led corporate earnings last quarter to
the highest level since 2007.  The  Topix  (TPX) traded  at 1.26 times book value yesterday,
compared with 2.6 for the S&P 500 and 1.81 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
