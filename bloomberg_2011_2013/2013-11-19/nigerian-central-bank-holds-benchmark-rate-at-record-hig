Nigeria’s central bank held its
benchmark interest rate at a record high as the threat of
overspending in a pre-election year in 2014 overshadows a
slowdown in inflation in  Africa ’s biggest oil producer.  The Monetary Policy Committee kept the rate at 12 percent,
Governor Lamido Sanusi told reporters today in the capital,
Abuja. That was in line with the forecasts of all 12 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Nigeria has maintained the benchmark
rate since October 2011 to help stabilize the naira and keep
inflation under control. While consumer prices rose at the
slowest pace in more than five years in October, gaining 7.8
percent from a year ago, inflation pressures may increase as the
nation prepares for elections in 2015.  The naira has fallen 0.6 percent against the dollar on the
interbank market in the past six months.  President Goodluck Jonathan today postponed his budget
speech for a second time in a week after lawmakers failed to
agree on the oil benchmark price in the 2014 spending plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
