Identifying which of the 1,406
artworks seized last year from a Munich apartment were looted by
the Nazi regime is the priority for investigators, the
prosecutor handling the case said today.  Once it is established which pieces were confiscated by
Nazi authorities, previous owners can claim restitution,
Augsburg chief prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz said in a statement.
The haul includes works by  Marc Chagall ,  Otto Dix ,  Pablo Picasso 
and  Pierre-Auguste Renoir .  Cornelius Gurlitt, the 80-year-old from whose Munich
apartment the cache was seized in a tax investigation in March
2012, doesn’t want to relinquish any of the art and is demanding
its return, Spiegel magazine reported Nov. 17. Germany’s
government has said as may as 590 of the artworks may have been
looted from Jewish collectors by the Nazis.  “Establishing the origin of the paintings will allow us to
identify without a doubt which of them are the property of the
person accused, which we will then immediately offer to return
to him,” Nemetz said in the statement.  Families of Jewish collectors whose artworks were
confiscated or sold under duress in the Nazi era have filed
claims for their looted works to the Augsburg prosecutor, who is
investigating Gurlitt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
