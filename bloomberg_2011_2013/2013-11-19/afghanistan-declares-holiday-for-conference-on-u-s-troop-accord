The Afghan government today declared
a six-day public holiday to tighten security during a national
conference that will vote on a draft agreement allowing U.S.
troops to stay in the nation after 2014.  The conference, known as the Loya Jirga, will begin Nov. 21
in Kabul and bring together 3,000 Afghan tribal, political and
intellectual leaders.  The security agreement with the U.S. will go to both houses
of the Afghan parliament for approval if it is passed by the
Loya Jirga, President  Hamid Karzai  said Nov. 16.  The declaration of the holiday comes three days after a
Taliban suicide car bomb near the venue for the Loya Jirga
killed 13 people and wounded dozens other.  “The Taliban attack will not affect the meeting, but our
meeting will certainly affect them,” Jawed Munadi, a delegate
to the Loya Jirga, said in an interview. “Our debates are based
on how to prevent such attacks and maintain security in
Afghanistan through the U.S. and Afghan agreement.”  Calling the Loya Jirga “illegitimate,”  Zabihullah Mujahed , a spokesman for Taliban, said in a phone interview that
those who vote for the security pact will be “the nation’s top
traitors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
