Indonesia’s rupiah forwards rose by
the most in three weeks and bonds gained after a Federal Reserve
official signaled monetary stimulus that’s fueled demand for
emerging-market assets will likely be maintained.  Fed Bank of  New York  President  William Dudley  said
yesterday that U.S. growth isn’t strong enough to spur the
improvement needed in jobs. The  Federal Open Market Committee 
releases minutes of its Oct. 29-30 meeting tomorrow, which may
give investors a clearer picture of when policy makers will
start trimming the $85 billion of monthly bond purchases. An
improvement in Indonesia’s current-account deficit failed to
avert a slide in the rupiah as it heads for a monthly loss.  “The dollar weakened on dovish remarks from the Fed, which
relieves some pressure on the rupiah, but it’s all still very
uncertain,” said Andy Ji, a Singapore-based currency strategist
at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia . “The rupiah will remain
under some depreciating pressure as the current-account
deficit’s narrowing is quite minimal.”  Rupiah one-month non-deliverable forwards surged 1 percent
to 11,360 per dollar as of 4:04 p.m. in Jakarta, the most since
Oct. 25, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts traded
2.1 percent stronger than the spot rate, which gained 0.3
percent to 11,598 per dollar, prices from local banks show.  Bond Auction  The  Finance Ministry  raised 12 trillion rupiah ($1 billion)
from sales of bonds due in one through 15 years today, exceeding
the 8 trillion rupiah goal, Robert Pakpahan, director general at
the debt management office, said in a mobile-phone text message.
Investors submitted bids for 2.8 times the amount offered, he
said.  The yield on Indonesia’s 5.625 percent government bonds
maturing in May 2023 dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 8.38 percent, lowest level since Nov. 11,
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  Overseas investors bought $25 million more Indonesian
stocks than they sold yesterday, the first net inflow since Oct.
31, according to exchange data. The current-account shortfall
narrowed to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product last quarter,
from a record 4.4 percent in the previous period, an official
report showed on Nov. 13.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the rupiah forwards was set
at 11,349 per dollar, from 11,427 yesterday by the Association
of Banks in  Singapore . One-month implied volatility in the
rupiah, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to
price options, fell two basis points to 14.34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
