State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co., the largest U.S. property-casualty insurer, said
it sold 23 buildings to  Lone Star  Funds and will lease them back
from the private-equity firm.  The properties are in 18 locations, according to an e-mail
today from Rachael Risinger, a spokeswoman for Bloomington,
Illinois-based State Farm. She said the deal was completed Nov.
8 and declined to disclose terms. A spokesman for Lone Star
declined to comment on the transaction.  The deal will provide cash for policyholder-owned State
Farm without requiring the company to issue debt. The insurer is
working to protect share in the auto market as Berkshire
Hathaway Inc.’s Geico unit and Progressive Corp. boost sales.  “Leasing rather than owning property provides State Farm
the flexibility to make adjustments in our operations to
better serve our customers,” Risinger said. She said the
insurer has options to renew the leases.  Lone Star, the world’s biggest buyer of delinquent
mortgages, last month finished raising more than $6 billion for
a fund to invest in commercial real estate debt and equity. The
Dallas-based firm, led by founder and Chairman  John Grayken ,
has never had a losing fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
