Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the
nation’s biggest producer, said Vice President Li Dongguang has
resigned and is under investigation.  Li is being probed by “relevant departments” for
“personal reasons,” the Beijing-based company, also known as
Chalco, said today in a statement to the  Shanghai  stock
exchange. Yuan Li, spokesman for Chalco’s parent Aluminum Corp.
of China, said he doesn’t have any further information when
contacted by phone.  Li, who was the president of Chalco’s international trading
unit, didn’t answer a call to his mobile phone today. The
incident won’t have an impact on the company and its production
operations remain normal, Chalco said today in the statement.  Chalco  shares  declined 0.3 percent to 3.97  yuan  in Shanghai
today, before the announcement was made. They have dropped 23
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
