Foreign investors led by  China 
raised  holdings  of Treasuries in September by the most since
February as the  Federal Reserve  surprised financial markets by
maintaining its $85 billion a month in bond purchases.  U.S. government securities held by China, the largest
foreign creditor to the U.S., climbed by $25.7 billion, or 2
percent, to $1.294 trillion, also the biggest gain since
February. Holdings by  Japan , the second largest overseas lender,
rose for a third month. They increased by $29 billion, or 2.5
percent, to $1.178 trillion, the most on record. The data were
released yesterday by the U.S. Treasury Department.  Total foreign holdings of Treasuries rose $57.1 billion, or
1 percent, in September to $5.65 trillion.  “The Fed taking a pass on tapering was a huge part of the
reason for that,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist
at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, one of 21 primary dealers
that trade with the Fed. “September is also when you wound up
having a weak payrolls print, and we did see some buying flows
during that period.”  The  U.S. economy  added fewer jobs in August than had been
forecast, the Labor Department said Sept. 6, while revised data
showed that workforce gains in July were smaller than first
reported. The central bank decided Sept. 18 “to await more
evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the
pace of its purchases” under the quantitative-easing stimulus
strategy, the  Federal Open Market Committee  said in a statement.  March Move  Fed policy makers will decide to reduce the purchases to
$70 billion a month at their March 18-19 meeting, according to
the median forecast of 32 economist estimates in a Bloomberg
survey on Nov. 8.  U.S. government securities held by overseas investors have
increased 1.4 percent this year, on track for the slowest rise
since the Treasury began releasing full-year data in 2001.  Revised data for August showed foreign holdings rose $1.9
billion for the month, compared with a previously reported $5.1
billion drop. Foreign holdings fell for four consecutive months
from April through July, the longest such period since 2001.  “A lot of the  foreign central-bank  Treasury positions are
really driven by considerations related to their domestic
economy, not to the U.S. rate outlook,” said Larry Dyer, a U.S.
interest-rate strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in New York, a
primary dealer.  “There’s a limited amount of time they can stay out of the
market,” Dyer said. “If they do nothing, the duration of their
portfolio shrinks. If they have growing assets, as long as the
U.S. has a trade deficit they ultimately have to buy something
with the dollars that come in.” Duration is a measure of the
sensitivity of a bond’s price to movements in  interest rates .  China, Japan  China’s Treasuries position has increased $73.4 billion, or
6 percent, this year after a 5.95 percent increase in 2012. The
holdings declined 0.7 percent to $1.152 trillion in 2011, the
first annual decrease on record going back to 2001.  Japan’s holdings are also up 6 percent in 2013, a $66.9
billion increase. Since falling to an 18-month low in June,
Japan has added $98.2 billion of U.S. government securities, a
9.1 percent increase. It was the largest three-month jump since
a 17.6 percent climb, or $159.4 billion, for the three months
ended November 2011 following Japanese currency interventions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
