Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-bank lending  rate , opened 0.08 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.06 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.06 percent to 0.25 percent and averaging 0.08 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire $2.75 billion to $3.5 billion
of Treasuries maturing from February 2021 to November 2023. The
permanent open market operations are part of the Fed’s latest
round of debt purchases, known as quantitative easing, aimed to
keep long-term rates low and support economic growth.  The Fed may also conduct a test of an overnight fixed-rate
reverse repo facility. The temporary open-market operations will
use Treasuries as collateral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
