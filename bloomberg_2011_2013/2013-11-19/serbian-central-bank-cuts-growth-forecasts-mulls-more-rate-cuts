Serbia ’s central bank cut its 2014
economic growth forecast for the second time in three months,
citing a short-term impact from the government’s fiscal
consolidation plans.  The economy will expand 1.5 percent next year, down from a
2.5 percent estimate in August, the National Bank of Serbia said
in its quarterly inflation report released in Belgrade today. It
left its 2013 growth forecast at 2 percent.  The central bank kept its inflation target unchanged at 4
percent plus or minus 1.5 percentage points through 2016 and
said it would consider further policy easing if fiscal
consolidation measures are implemented as planned. Risks to
inflation include the global economic environment and “external
financing” prospects as the world’s major central banks are
expected to tighten policy.  The National Bank of Serbia predicts expanding exports and
slower imports to narrow the current-account gap to between 4
percent and 5 percent of gross domestic product this year, from
a forecast of 7 percent in August.  Net foreign direct investment stood at 518 million euros
($700 million) in the nine months through September. Bank
lending shrank 1.1 percent, declining for the third straight
quarter, while non-performing loans rose 1.1 percentage points
since June to 21.1 percent, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
