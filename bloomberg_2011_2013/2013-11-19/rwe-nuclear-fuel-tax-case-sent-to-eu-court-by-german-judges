RWE AG’s lawsuit challenging
 Germany ’s nuclear-fuel tax will be referred by German judges to
the Europe Union’s highest court for review.  The Hamburg Tax Court will ask the judges at the  European
Court  of Justice whether the tax is in line with EU rules,
Presiding Judge Christoph Schoenfeld said at a hearing today.
The tribunal will also ask whether it can send the case to the
EU court after it sent a parallel case to Germany’s top
constitutional court in January, he said.  EON AG and RWE are fighting the tax in various German
courts. They won rulings in Hamburg and Munich while losing a
suit in Stuttgart. Today’s decision doesn’t suspend payment
duties under the rules, the Hamburg court said.  RWE briefly rose as much as 2 percent after the Hamburg
court’s decision and was 7 cents down at 27.71 euros at 1:06
p.m. in Frankfurt trading.  The court hasn’t formulated the questions in detail and
still needs to put its decision in writing, the tribunal’s
spokesman Matthias Tiemann said.  Today’s case is FG Hamburg, 4 K 122/13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
