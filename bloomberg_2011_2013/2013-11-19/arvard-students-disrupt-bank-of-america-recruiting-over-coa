Harvard University students
disrupted a  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  recruiting event yesterday in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, to protest the company’s support of
the coal industry.  The protest was part of a campaign by the  Rainforest Action
Network  to convince banks to phase out coal investments, which
the group says contribute to  climate change . Students have
disrupted recruiting by Bank of America and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  at
other campuses, according to Alli Welton, a Harvard
undergraduate who participated in the protest yesterday.  “We simply want jobs that do not create droughts that wipe
out our food supplies or strengthen the hurricanes that threaten
our homes,” the Harvard students said in a  letter  delivered to
Bank of America representatives, according to a statement today.  Welton said she and another student were escorted out by
police after disrupting the recruiting event, while six other
students were prevented from entering the venue at the Charles
Hotel in Cambridge. The protest against Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America was one of more than 50 targeted
against the bank and Citgroup so far this semester, said Todd
Zimmer of the Rainforest Action Network.  Calls and an e-mail sent to T.J. Crawford, a spokesman for
Bank of America, weren’t returned. Kevin Galvin, a spokesman for
Harvard, declined to comment.  Brown University ’s governing body, the Brown Corp., decided
last month to  reject a recommendation  from an advisory committee
of students, faculty, staff and alumni calling for coal
divestment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
