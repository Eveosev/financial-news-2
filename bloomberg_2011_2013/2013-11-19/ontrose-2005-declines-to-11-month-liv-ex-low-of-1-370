Two cases of 2005 Chateau Montrose,
a second-growth wine estate in Saint-Estephe, sold for 850
pounds ($1,370) each in the past week, an 11-month low for the
vintage on Liv-ex amid muted demand for top  Bordeaux .  The transactions, one yesterday and another on Nov. 15,
took the vintage down 5.5 percent from its September level and
back to the price it traded at in late November last year,
according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, tracking leading Bordeaux
vintages, has declined since mid-March, erasing an 8 percent
gain made in the previous 10 weeks to leave it 0.6 percent down
since the start of this year as investors have sought value
outside of the Bordeaux first and second growths.  “Montrose is fairly fully priced,” as are some other
second-growth wines, Brian Mota, co-managing partner with
Timothy Clew at TWT Investment Partners LP in Ridgefield,
 Connecticut , said by phone yesterday.  A “relative-value play” now exists in Bordeaux, according
to Mota, with the 2012 vintage and some wines from the Pessac-Leognan district south of the city offering opportunities even
as first growths remain under pressure. “While the Liv-ex is
flat for the year, we are in decidedly more positive
territory,” he said.  Hart Sale  Montrose 2005 fetched 624 pounds in June 2006 soon after it
went on sale, and is now trading 36 percent above that level. It
peaked at 1,200 pounds in July 2011, as Asian demand for top
Bordeaux was at its height.  Even after the recent decline, a case of Montrose 2005
still fetched $1,673 at a  Hart Davis Hart Wine Co.  sale in
 Chicago  last month, according to the auction house’s website.  The 2005 Montrose is the estate’s fourth highest-priced
vintage of the past 10 years, according to merchant data
collated by Liv-ex.  It scored 95 points from U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker ,
putting it among the top five vintages of the past 10 years,
according the eRobertParker website.  Chateau Montrose has been owned since 2006 by Martin and
Olivier Bouygues, who run Paris-based construction and media
company  Bouygues SA. (EN)  The estate is ranked as a second-growth
vineyard in the Bordeaux classification drawn up for Napoleon
III’s 1855 Paris Exhibition. That puts it among the top 20
producers in the Medoc region, which is to the northwest of the
city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
