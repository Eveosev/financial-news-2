 Taiwan’s dollar rose to a one-week
high after Federal Reserve officials signaled support for
maintaining record stimulus that’s buoyed emerging-market
assets.  Government bonds  advanced.  New York  Fed President William C. Dudley said yesterday
that while he’s becoming “more hopeful” the  U.S. economy  is
rebounding, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a
period of time. That follows comments last week by Fed Chairman-nominee  Janet Yellen , who said stimulus shouldn’t be removed as
long as the recovery is fragile. Global funds bought $47 million
more local stocks than they sold yesterday, after pulling $677
million last week, exchange data show.  “It seems pretty certain Yellen will be Fed Chairman and
her comments indicate easing will continue,” said Samson Tu, a
Taipei-based fund manager at Uni-President Assets Management
Corp. “So the trend of money returning to the U.S. may reverse,
though fund flows into  emerging markets  won’t be as strong as
before.”  Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.4 percent to NT$29.471 against the
greenback as of 10:12 a.m. local time, prices from Taipei Forex
Inc. show. The currency touched NT$29.460 earlier, the strongest
level since Nov. 11.  The local dollar lost 0.2 percent in the last minute of
trading yesterday amid suspected central bank intervention. The
monetary authority has sold the currency in the run-up to the
close on most days since March 2012, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  Forwards, Bonds  The U.S. central bank will release minutes of the  Federal
Open Market Committee ’s Oct. 29-30 meeting tomorrow, before a
Nov. 21 Senate Banking Committee vote on Yellen’s nomination.  One-month non-deliverable forwards on the local dollar fell
0.1 percent to NT$29.404 per dollar, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The contracts rose 0.4 percent yesterday, the most
since Oct. 3.  Taiwan’s five-year government bonds advanced for a fifth
day. The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due October 2018 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.117 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, decreased two basis
points to 3.31 percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was
steady at 0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
