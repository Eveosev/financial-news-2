Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  climbed the most in almost two weeks as physical
inventories in the world’s largest user declined and on optimism
that economic reform plans will support growth.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract by volume
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, rose 0.9 percent to 3,624  yuan 
($595) a metric ton at today’s close. That was the biggest gain
since since Nov. 7.  Rebar  stockpiles  tracked by Shanghai Steelhome Information
Technology Co. dropped to 5.31 million tons last week, the
lowest since January 2011. China pledged to allow more private
investment in the state-controlled industries, loosen its one-child policy and expand farmers’ land rights, according to a
policy decision published by Xinhua News Agency on Nov. 15.  “Today’s surge is a belated reaction to falling physical
stockpiles and the country’s plan to sustain the growth,” said
Ren Xinlei, an analyst at Luzheng Futures Co. in Jinan.  Iron ore  for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
rose 1.1 percent to 942 yuan a ton today. The steel-making
 material  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port tracked by The
Steel Index gained 0.2 percent to $137 a dry ton yesterday.  Rebar for immediate delivery tracked by Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. was little changed at 3,538 yuan a
ton today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
