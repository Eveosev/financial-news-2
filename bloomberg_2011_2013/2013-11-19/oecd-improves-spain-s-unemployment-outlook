The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development lowered its forecast for Spanish
unemployment, saying the jobless rate will peak this year and
won’t continue to increase in 2014 as the economy  stabilizes .  The rate will be 26.3 percent next year, almost unchanged
from 26.4 percent in 2013, the Paris-based organization
predicted in its semi-annual Economic Outlook published today.
In May, it said joblessness would reach 27.3 percent this year
before climbing to 28 percent in 2014.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is counting on exports to
generate growth as the deepest  budget cuts  in  Spain ’s democratic
history undermine domestic demand. The government forecasts the
euro region’s fourth-largest economy will grow 0.7 percent next
year after exiting a two-year recession in the third quarter.  The OECD improved its economic forecast for 2013 to a
contraction of 1.3 percent from 1.7 percent. It said gross
domestic product will expand 0.5 percent in 2014, instead of 0.4
percent, as private consumption will shrink less than expected
in May.  “Recent indicators suggest that the declines in domestic
demand are starting to abate,” the OECD said in the report.
“ Core inflation  is also subsiding, boding well for consumer
purchasing power.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
