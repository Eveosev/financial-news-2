PayPal, the online payment service
that succeeded by wedding itself to  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , is moving into
more modern marketplaces through a deal with car-service company
Uber Technologies Inc.  Users of Uber’s popular mobile-booking application will be
able to pay with PayPal starting today in the U.S.,  France ,
Germany,  Italy  and the Netherlands, David Marcus, president of
PayPal, said in an interview. Riders who use PayPal before Nov.
28 will receive $15 or 15 euros toward their next trip.  After pioneering Internet payments and then being acquired
by  San Jose , California-based EBay in 2002, PayPal became a
multi-billion dollar  annual business . The company has been slow
to make headway into newer marketplaces that cater to a mobile-savvy group of users and developers, Marcus said, while posing
as an Uber driver and chauffeuring reporters around  San
Francisco  to show off how the service will work.  “Our experiences inside mobile apps were not meeting the
bar a year ago,” Marcus said, from the driver’s seat of a black
Ford Expedition. “It’s important to be where disruption occurs.
You want to partner with the companies creating an amazing
consumer experience.”  The market for mobile payments in the U.S. is projected to
jump to $90 billion in 2017 from $20.5 billion this year,
according to  Forrester Research. (FORR)  In that area, PayPal faces
stepped up competition from Square Inc. and Google Inc.  PayPal has been criticized for antiquated software that
makes it hard for merchants and developers to use the service,
something Marcus has tried to streamline. He vowed to bring
“startup energy” to PayPal when he took the helm in April
2012.  Mobile Upgrades  To work better with mobile services, PayPal has developed
functions that allows users to pay without leaving a merchant’s
app. Its shortcomings on mobile gave younger companies with
simpler offerings such as Braintree a chance to win users at
PayPal’s expense. PayPal agreed to acquire Braintree earlier
this year for $800 million.  The improvements may help PayPal make headway into other
popular marketplaces such as room-sharing service Airbnb Inc.,
which doesn’t use the company’s payment offering in its mobile
app, Marcus said.  Uber is banking on international growth to justify its $3.5
billion valuation, achieved in a financing round led by Google’s
venture arm in August.  The company only allows users to pay via mobile phones and
is limited in countries such as  Germany  that don’t have wide
credit-card adoption, Travis Kalanick, chief executive officer
of the San Francisco-based company, said in an interview..
PayPal’s 137 million active users were also a draw.  “Who else has that kind of distribution -- is there even
anyone close?” Kalanick said. “The PayPal deal helps us go
international. For Uber, this is about new users.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
