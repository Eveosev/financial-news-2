Palm oil  retreated for a second day
on concern that exports from Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer, may decline as a rally in the ringgit and
weakening crude  oil prices  curb demand.  The contract for delivery in February, the most-active by
volume, fell as much as 0.9 percent to 2,569 ringgit ($806) a
metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives and ended the
morning session at 2,573 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur .  Exports from Malaysia dropped 4.6 percent to 744,975 tons
in the first 15 days of November from the same period a month
earlier, surveyor Intertek said on Nov. 15. The ringgit has
gained 0.7 percent against the dollar in the past week, lowering
the appeal of commodities priced in the Malaysian currency.  “The recent strengthening of the ringgit against the
greenback has discouraged some purchases by overseas buyers and
refiners,” Tan Chee Tat, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte.,
said by phone from Singapore. “Another reason is the weakness
in crude oil prices as this causes palm oil to lose some demand
in biodiesel usage.”  West Texas Intermediate oil for delivery in December traded
near a five-month low at $92.93 a barrel in electronic trading
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange today. Palm oil, used in
everything from candy to biofuels, entered a  bull market  this
month and is heading for its first annual gain in three years as
production declines in Indonesia, the biggest supplier.  “Prices have rallied quite a bit in a short span of time
and this has enticed some investors to book profits,” Tan said.  Soybean oil for January delivery increased 0.3 percent to
40.47 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans were
little changed at $12.8925 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for May delivery advanced 0.3 percent to
6,260 yuan ($1,027) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and
soybean oil was little changed at 7,184  yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
