Caesars Acquisition Co. (CACQ) , the spinoff
from  Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR)  that gives investors a separate
stake in the parent company’s online gambling business, rose in
the first day of trading.  Caesars Entertainment, the largest owner of casinos in the
U.S., offered shareholders the right to buy stock in the
subsidiary for $8.64 a share to bolster its balance sheet and
highlight what the company sees as growth businesses. Caesars
Acquisition distributed 135.7 million shares to investors,
raising $1.17 billion, according to a statement yesterday.  The shares, listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the
symbol CACQ, closed at $11.05 in New York, giving the company a
market value of about $1.5 billion. The shares opened for
trading at $11.90.  Caesars Acquisition owns a 42 percent interest in Caesars
Growth Partners, an entity that owns the Planet Hollywood Casino
in  Las Vegas , a new casino under construction in Baltimore and
most of Caesars Interactive, the company’s online gambling unit.
Caesars Entertainment retains the rest.  The private-equity firms  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  and
TPG Capital acquired Caesars in a $30.7 billion leveraged buyout
in 2008. The firms, which have been restructuring Las Vegas-based Caesars’ debts since then, committed $600 million to
Caesars Acquisition, the company said.  Caesars Entertainment, owner of the namesake casino on the
Las Vegas Strip,  fell  3.6 percent to $18.52 in New York. The
stock had almost tripled this year as of yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
