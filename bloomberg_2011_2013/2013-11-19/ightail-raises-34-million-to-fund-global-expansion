Hightail Inc., the Internet file-sharing company formerly known as YouSendIt, raised $34 million
to expand globally and add cloud offerings.  The financing was led by Western Digital Capital and
included participation from Accolade Partners, the Campbell,
California-based company said today in a statement. Hightail has
now raised a total of $83 million.  Founded in 2004, YouSendIt gained popularity by letting
users send audio and visual files that were too big for e-mail.
Former Yahoo! Inc. executive Brad Garlinghouse joined as chief
executive officer last year and has refocused the business on
file sharing and remote document access, a market where it
competes with Dropbox Inc. and Box Inc.  “The shift in how all users share and store their data
create huge opportunities in this space,” Garlinghouse said in
an interview.  Hightail’s revenue increased 45 percent last year to $56
million, Garlinghouse said. The company recently opened offices
in the U.K. and  Australia  and doubled the number of salespeople
signing up business customers, he said.  In September, Hightail acquired  AdeptCloud , a file-sharing
company focused on security and privacy. Hightail has more than
40 million users, including those accessing the free product
with 2 gigabytes of storage.  Existing backers including Alloy Ventures, Sevin Rosen,
Emergence  Capital Partners , Adams Street Partners and Sigma
Partners joined in the funding round.  To contact the reporter on this story:
