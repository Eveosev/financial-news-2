Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and  Orix Corp. (8591)  plan to
build a 2-megawatt geothermal station in central  Japan  using
Toshibaâ€™s small-power generation system.  Toshiba will take a 55 percent stake in a venture set up by
the two companies, while Orix will hold the remainder, according
to a statement today.  Surveys will be done in the Nakao area in Gifu prefecture
in central Japan with a goal to building a plant once commercial
viability is confirmed, according to the statement. The plant is
expected to start in 2015.  The companies plan to invest less than 2 billion yen ($20
million), the Nikkei newspaper reported earlier today.
Additional surveys are needed before the cost can be determined,
Toshiba spokesman Tomoyuki Numata said.  Toshiba has supplied geothermal power generation systems
for almost half a century, while Orix has been promoting
renewable energy such as solar and biomass, the companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
