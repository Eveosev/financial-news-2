Indianapolis Colts linebacker Erik
Walden was suspended for this week’s  National Football League 
game against the  Arizona Cardinals  after ripping the helmet off
an opposing player and then head-butting him.  The NFL yesterday also issued a one-game suspension to
Tampa Bay Buccaneers safety Dashon Goldson for a helmet-to-helmet hit on a defenseless receiver. Goldson in September had a
one-game NFL ban dropped on appeal and instead drew a $100,000
fine for his second illegal hit of the season. He was also fined
$30,000 for a head-to-head hit in Week 1.  Walden was penalized for unnecessary roughness during the
second quarter of the Colts’ 30-27 win against Tennessee on Nov.
14 for delivering a head butt with his helmet to the uncovered
head of Titans tight end Delanie Walker.  Walden and Goldson can be reinstated on Nov. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
