(Corrects headline, first paragraph to reflect ETF is
started by Bosera in story published yesterday.)  Bosera Asset Management Co. is
starting an exchange-traded fund to allow traders in China to
invest in the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index, the benchmark gauge
for U.S. equities.  The ETF, created by Shenzhen-based Bosera with a license
from S&P Dow Jones Indices, would be the first linked to the  S&P
500  that trades in China, S&P said in a statement today. The
Shanghai Composite Index has lost 3.4 percent this year, while
the S&P 500 has rallied 26 percent, putting it on track for the
biggest annual gain since 2003.  Assets under management of ETFs listed in mainland China
was more than 150 billion  yuan  ($25 billion) in the third
quarter, with about 80 funds available, S&P said. About $5.74
trillion in assets is benchmarked to the S&P 500, according to
the statement.  Some $109 billion has gone to ETFs that track U.S. stocks
since the start of 2013, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  ETFs are bundles of securities that trade on a stock
exchange. They have attracted investors with their low costs,
tax advantages and tradability. Most ETFs track an  index (SHCOMP)  of
stocks or bonds. In the U.S., the industry gathered $715 billion
in the five years through 2012, more than twice that collected
by actively managed mutual funds, according to data compiled by
the  Investment Company Institute  in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
