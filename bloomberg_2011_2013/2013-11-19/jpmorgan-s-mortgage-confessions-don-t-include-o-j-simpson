The  JPMorgan mortgage settlement  came out today, but it's been  about to come out  for so long now that I think I should get a pass from writing about it. The thing that everyone knew would happen, happened, in about the way everyone knew it would happen. Lotta money: $13 billion in all,  of which  $7 billion is civil securities settlements, $2 billion is "a civil penalty to settle the Justice Department claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA)," and $4 billion is "in the form of relief to aid consumers harmed by the unlawful conduct of JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual," although importantly  not  the unlawful conduct that is settled here, which is all about tricking buyers of those loans, not borrowers. Though I guess the working thesis is that tricking the buyers led to the financial crisis, which hurt consumers too, I don't know, sure, why not. If I told you that  the statement of facts , in which JPMorgan admits to all of its and Bear's and WaMu's sordid mortgage misdeeds, is boring, you'd be like, well, it's a list of mortgage misdeeds, of course it is boring. And I can't argue with you there. But it is not boring in the usual way that lists of mortgage misdeeds are boring. The usual way is: This statement of facts is 11 pages long, which is a sure sign that something weird is going on. And that's for three companies! WaMu's pre-acquisition conduct gets just under one page. One page! I mean here is the entire official substance of Washington Mutual's role in causing the financial crisis: 1  I count zero strippers. On the other hand I count five "instances," four "certains," an "at times," and an "and/or." This is a pretty bloodless summary is what I am saying. Your blood will not boil at this. Here, on the other hand, is  the Federal Housing Finance Agency's complaint  in its lawsuit against JPMorgan over its, Bear's and WaMu's mortgage badness, which is settled by this settlement. Here is an actual paragraph (paragraph 246, emphasis added for reasons that will become apparent) from that complaint: Guys. GUYS. You start your press conference with that quote. Show the lousy underwriting, don't tell. "There were certain instances of weaknesses in WaMu's loan origination and underwriting practices,  like giving O.J. Simpson a second mortgage because he told you he didn't do it ." The rest of the settlement's statement of facts is similarly dull and generic and stripped of all the color and obvious horribleness of the complaints themselves. The reasons for that are obvious. "For JPMorgan, any admissions had to strike a delicate balance," as DealBook  puts it , "satisfying the government, but not stoking private lawsuits from investors." The result leans pretty far in the direction of not stoking lawsuits. Everything is vague -- "in one instance," not "in Pool XYZ-123" -- so that no private investor can say "aha, see,  my  securitization is the one with this fraud." There are things that were not communicated to investors, but no admission that those things were material. 2  There are "certain instances" of loans not complying with underwriting guidelines, but without any quantification it is hard to determine whether those certain instances invalidate JPMorgan's representations "that loans in the securitized pools were originated 'generally' in conformity with the loan originatorâ€™s underwriting guidelines; and that exceptions were made based on 'compensating factors,' determined after 'careful consideration' on a 'case-by-case basis.'" In other words, maybe everything was great. This statement of facts is not even close to adequate to conclude that JPMorgan, Bear or WaMu committed fraud in their mortgage securitizations. I mean, I guess, who cares, the settlement -- the $13 billion -- is enough to conclude that. Three weeks ago, when the settlement started to be imminent,  I wrote about  my worry that it was likely to be a mush of anecdote, with no effort to quantify how bad JPMorgan/Bear/WaMu were relative to other banks, or how much their badness cost investors. That struck me as a missed opportunity: Given the attention this settlement is getting, and the fact that it is  perhaps just the start  of similar deals with other banks, it would be nice if it set a clear benchmark for what mortgage wrongdoing looks like and how it will be measured, evaluated, compared, and ultimately punished. Nope! If anything I was too optimistic. This settlement is a mush, but it is an anecdote-free mush. Never mind failing to establish whether JPBearMu were worse than anyone else; this settlement doesn't even establish that they were bad. Just that they're paying a lot of money to make it go away. 3  1   There's another paragraph about how WaMu was seized by the OTS, placed in FDIC receivership, and sold to JPMorgan.
