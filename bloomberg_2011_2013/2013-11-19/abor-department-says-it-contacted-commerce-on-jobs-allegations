The Labor Department has contacted
the Census Bureau about allegations in a  New York  Post article
that the jobs data heading into the 2012 presidential election
were manipulated.  “We have contacted the Census Bureau about the allegations
and we understand that the matter has been referred to the
Commerce Department for an investigation,” Stephen Barr, a
senior managing director in the Labor Department’s Office of
Public Affairs, said today in an interview.  The Census Bureau is the government agency that contacts
households to get data used to calculate the monthly
 unemployment rate . It shares those figures with the Labor
Department which issues the employment report. The Census Bureau
is part of the Department of Commerce.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
