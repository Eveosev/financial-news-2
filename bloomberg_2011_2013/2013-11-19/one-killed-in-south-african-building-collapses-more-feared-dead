One person was killed and 29
critically injured after the shopping mall under construction in
 South Africa ’s KwaZulu-Natal province collapsed, emergency
services spokesman Chris Botha said.  About 50 more people are believed to be trapped in the
rubble at the construction site at Tongaat, north of Durban on
the country’s east coast, Botha said by phone. All the victims
are workers on the site, which had reached the second floor at
the time of the accident.  “We fear that the death toll may rise,” Botha said.
“Twenty-nine people have already been taken to hospital and
emergency services and the fire department are removing rubble
to find more of the workmen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
