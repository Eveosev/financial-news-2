Ghana  Finance Minister Seth Terkper
pledged to narrow the budget gap by curbing wages and boosting
revenue to reassure investors and underpin its credit rating
following a downgrade last month.  The fiscal deficit is forecast to narrow to 8.5 percent of
gross domestic product in 2014 from an estimated 10.2 percent
this year, Terkper said in a budget speech to lawmakers in the
capital, Accra. The economy will expand 8 percent next year,
compared with 7.4 percent in 2013, he said.  The government’s “fiscal policy will continue to aim at
ensuring fiscal prudence and debt sustainability through
improved revenue mobilization and rationalizing and enhancing
the efficiency of public expenditures, as well as reviewing our
financing methods,” he said.  Ghana is struggling to reduce a budget gap that reached 12
percent of economic output in 2012 during a presidential
election year. The government has tried to compensate for a jump
in public wages to 74 percent of tax income by cutting subsidies
for fuel, water and electricity. It also raised the value-added
tax rate to 15 percent from 12.5 percent on Nov. 15.  Fitch Ratings last month lowered Ghana’s credit rating to B
from B+ as the government failed to achieve its fiscal deficit
goal of 9 percent for this year and overran spending on interest
payments.  Pay Cut  Expenditure will climb 18 percent to 35 billion cedis ($15
billion), Terkper said. The government expects to raise 26
billion cedis in revenue and grants while borrowing in local and
international markets will rise to about 9 billion cedis in
2014. President John Dramani Mahama and his government ministers
agreed to a 10 percent pay cut for 2014 to help alleviate the
wage bill, Terkper said.  “The target to borrow 4 billion cedis from the domestic
economy is a lot of money and that is going to crowd out the
private sector,” Sampson Akligoh, head of research at Databank
Financial Services Ltd. in Accra, said by phone. “The sources
of the deficit are wages and statutory payments, which we should
not borrow to pay for.”  The cedi is the third-worst performing African currency,
this year, plunging 16 percent against the dollar. The cedi fell
0.9 percent to 2.265 per dollar by 2:25 p.m. in Accra today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
