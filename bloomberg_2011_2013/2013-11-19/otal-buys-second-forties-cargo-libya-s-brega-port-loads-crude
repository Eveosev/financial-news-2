Total SA bought a cargo of  North Sea 
Forties crude, its second this week, while Vitol Group didn’t
manage to sell Russian Urals crude at a lower discount than
yesterday.  Libya’s Brega oil terminal loaded a cargo of crude onto a
tanker, probably the facility’s first since shipments were
halted over a month ago amid production and export constraints
across the country.  North Sea  Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold Forties cargo F1203 for Dec. 4
to Dec. 6 to Total at a premium of 10 cents a barrel to Dated
Brent, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That’s 5 cents less than a
trade between the two companies yesterday.  Trafigura Beheer BV failed to buy Forties for Dec. 9 to
Dec. 14 at Dated Brent plus 20 cents, the survey showed. Total
was bidding for either Dec. 9 to Dec. 14 Forties at plus 10
cents, or  Brent crude  for loading on Dec. 11 to Dec. 13 at plus
40 cents. Mercuria Energy Trading SA was bidding for Brent crude
on Dec. 11 to Dec. 13 at parity to the benchmark.  Total bought Ekofisk cargo C11475 from Shell at $1 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, the survey showed. The grade last traded
in the window on Oct. 21 at the same level.  The French producer didn’t manage to buy Oseberg for Dec.
11 to Dec. 13 loading at $1 a barrel more than Dated Brent for a
second day. The grade was last offered in the window at plus 80
cents on Nov. 14.  Brent for January settlement traded at $108.15 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $108.58 in the previous session. The February
contract was at $107.72, a discount of 43 cents to January.  A work-slow action by Norwegian oil-platform maintenance
workers probably won’t affect production unless critical
offshore repairs are needed.  The conflicts over wages at oil-service companies Bilfinger
SE, Beerenberg Corp. AS and Kaefer GmbH, where about 1,400
employees have been working at 45 percent capacity for as long
as four days, have caused project delays on ConocoPhillips’
Ekofisk and Statoil ASA’s Statfjord field installations, Safe
union leader Hilde-Marit Rysst said today.  “Production would probably be impacted if you got a
shutdown that required scaffolding for example,” Rysst said
today by mobile phone.  Oil companies  will otherwise only face
delays, she said.  Urals/Mediterranean  Vitol offered 100,000 metric tons of Urals for Nov. 29 to
Dec. 3 at a discount of $1.35 a barrel to Dated on a delivered
basis to Rotterdam, according to the survey. That’s 35 cents a
barrel less than the company’s offer yesterday.  Hellenic Petroleum SA is seeking 80,000 metric tons of
Urals for Dec. 3 to Dec. 5 delivery to  Greece , according to two
people with knowledge of the matter, asking not to be identified
because the information is confidential. The tender closes
tomorrow at 1 p.m. local time.  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS is looking to buy
85,000 or 135,000 tons of CPC Blend crude for Dec. 10 to Dec. 25
delivery, according to three people with knowledge of the
tender. The tender closed today at 2 p.m. local time.  The Matilda, a ship able to haul about 600,000 barrels of
crude, is was loading at  Libya ’s Brega facility in the center-east and will depart today, Ibrahim Al Awami, the director of
measurement for the oil ministry, said by phone today. Libya’s
National Oil Corp. said yesterday that a tanker would load at
Mellitah, a facility in the west.  West Africa  Taiwan CPC Corp. is seeking to buy 1.9 million barrels of
west African crude for January delivery, according to a tender
document posted on the company’s  website . Offers are due at 10
a.m. tomorrow and are valid until 7 p.m. on Nov. 22.  PT Pertamina’s tender to buy 950,000 barrels of crude for
Jan. 7 to Jan. 9 delivery to its Cilacap refinery in Java closed
yesterday, with offers valid until today at 6 p.m. Singapore
time, a tender document obtained by Bloomberg shows.  Indian Oil Corp.’s tender to buy crude for Jan 1. to Jan.
15 also closed today, according to a document obtained by
 Bloomberg News . The tender’s results were not immediately
available. The company bought 5 million barrels of Nigerian Qua
Iboe,  Bonny Light , EA and Escravos from Shell, Total and Chevron
Corp. in its first tender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
