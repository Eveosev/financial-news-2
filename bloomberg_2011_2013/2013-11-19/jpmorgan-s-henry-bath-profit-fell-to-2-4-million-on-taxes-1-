Henry Bath & Son Ltd., the
commodities warehouse unit of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  that it wants
to sell, reported profit of $2.4 million last year as revenue
jumped 24 percent.  Profit dropped from $27.7 million a year earlier due to tax
changes, Liverpool, England-based Henry Bath said in a filing
with the U.K.’s Companies House. Before taxes, profit rose to
$42.57 million from $34.19 million. Revenue rose to $148.96
million from $120.28 million. The company provides storage for
cocoa, coffee and metal stockpiles.  “Stock holdings have continued to grow through 2012,
resulting in a positive impact on the group profits,” Henry
Bath said in the filing. It had net assets of $311.9 million.  JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, said in July that it plans
to get out of the business of owning and trading physical
commodities. The firm could sell or spin off holdings that
include Henry Bath, as well as stakes in power plants and
traders in materials such as gas and coal. The New York-based
firm has sought $3.3 billion for the division, a person with
direct knowledge of the sale process said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
