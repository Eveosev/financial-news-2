U.S. stocks  fell after disappointing
forecasts from  Best Buy (BBY)  Co. and Campbell Soup Co. while
investors awaited a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  to gauge the prospect of continued stimulus.  Best Buy slid 11 percent, the most in almost a year, after
saying it will work to keep pace with competitors’ discounts in
the holiday season, hurting fourth-quarter profitability.
Campbell Soup fell 6.2 percent after cutting its profit
forecast.  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  gained 0.9 percent after boosting its
earnings forecast as rising home prices spurred homeowners to
splurge on renovations. Tyson Foods Inc. climbed 4.6 percent for
a sixth day of gains as sales beat analysts’ expectations.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent to
1,787.87 at 4 p.m. in  New York . Yesterday, the gauge briefly
surpassed  1,800 (SPX)  for the first time. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  lost 8.99 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to
15,967.03. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges, about 3 percent below the three-month average.  “The economy is not doing badly, and the Fed is remaining
very aggressive and very friendly toward the market,” Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at RW Baird & Co., said by
phone from Sarasota,  Florida . His firm oversees $100 billion.
“We’ve had a big run. My suspicion is that the market might go
sideways now for a little while before we encounter a year-end
rally in December.”  The S&P 500 is up 25 percent this year, putting it on track
for the biggest annual gain since 2003, as the Fed kept its
monetary stimulus to spur economic growth and corporate earnings
topped analysts’ estimates.  ‘More Hopeful’  Bernanke is scheduled to speak in  Washington  today after
Fed Bank of New York President  William Dudley  said yesterday
that while he’s “more hopeful” the  U.S. economy  is
strengthening, it’s not enough to warrant stimulus cuts yet.  Chicago Fed President  Charles Evans , among the most vocal
advocates for additional easing from the Fed, said today that
while the central bank is going to deliver highly accommodative
policy until it can get the economy where it wants, the biggest
challenge is credibility.  The  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
cut global growth forecasts for this year and next as emerging-market economies including India and  Brazil  cool. The world
economy may expand 2.7 percent this year and 3.6 percent next
year, instead of the 3.1 percent and 4 percent predicted in May,
the Paris-based OECD said in a report today. Growth in the U.S.
will be 1.7 percent and 2.9 percent this year and next, broadly
similar to the outlook in May.  Fed Minutes  The Fed will release minutes of its October policy meeting
tomorrow. The document will reveal more details behind the
decision to press on with $85 billion in monthly asset
purchases.  Policy makers will probably pare that pace to $70 billion
at their March 18-19 meeting, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey. Three rounds of monetary stimulus have
helped propel the  S&P 500  up 165 percent from a bear-market low
in 2009.  Wall Street strategists have played catch-up in their U.S.
stock-market forecasting for most of the year. Yesterday’s
average prediction for the S&P 500 stood at 1,733, or almost 59
points below the index’s closing value. The gap dwindled to this
year’s low of minus 70 points at the end of last week from a
high of 84 points on Jan. 8.  John Stoltzfus, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer &
Co. in New York, today boosted his 2013 projection for the S&P
500 by 4.7 percent to 1,812, citing the market’s strength. The
index will end next year at 2,014, he forecast.  Economic Recovery  “Recent improvements in the tone of U.S. economic data
suggest to us that prospects are good for investors to see a
continuation of the economic recovery that could drive earnings
higher in the year ahead,” Stoltzfus wrote in a note.  The S&P 500 trades at 16.9 times reported operating profit,
a 20 percent increase from the beginning of 2013, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Last week, the benchmark’s  valuation 
reached the highest level since May 2010.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , the
gauge of S&P 500 options known as the VIX, rose 2.2 percent
today to 13.39. The measure is down 26 percent this year.  Six out of the 10 main S&P 500 industries declined as
industrial and utility shares fell more than 0.6 percent for the
worst performance.  Best Buy  Best Buy declined 11 percent to $38.78. Sales were little
changed at $9.36 billion in the period ended Nov. 2, trailing
the $9.37 billion analysts estimated on average.  Campbell Soup  lost 6.2 percent to $39.20. The company said
profit this year will be less than it previously estimated after
a recall and changes in retailers’ buying patterns hurt first-quarter results.  Salesforce.com Inc. slipped 5 percent to $52.74. The
biggest maker of customer-management software forecast fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings of 6 cents a share at most. Analysts on
average estimated 7 cents.  Home Depot gained 0.9 percent to $80.38. The one-and-a-half
year gain in the U.S. housing market is giving consumers the
confidence they need to remodel kitchens and bathrooms. The
number of transactions in the quarter increased 4 percent to
344.3 million while the average purchase climbed 3.2 percent to
$56.27, Home Depot said.  Tyson (TSN)  Foods  Tyson Foods added 4.6 percent to $30.78. The largest U.S.
meat processor yesterday posted higher-than-expected quarterly
revenue after a gain in prices and sales volumes for beef and
chicken.  Boston Scientific Corp. climbed 3.4 percent to $11.96. The
company’s Vercise deep brain stimulation system received CE Mark
approval, as it met certain European product standards, for
treatment of dystonia.  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the electric-car maker under an
investigation by U.S. auto regulators, climbed 3.7 percent to
$126.09, rebounding from a 10 percent decline yesterday. Craig Irwin, an analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc., said the probe
was “entirely expected” and may be positive as it’s likely to
lead to an independent confirmation of credibility of the
company’s design.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
announced the probe today in a website posting following three
fires in five weeks after roadway mishaps. The NHTSA said it
would look into the fire risks from the cars’ undercarriages
striking objects. The probe involves 13,108 Model S vehicles.  United Continental Holdings Inc. added 3.9 percent to
$37.80. The world’s biggest airline said it will cut $2 billion
in annual spending with half of the savings coming from lowering
fuel expense.  To contact the reporters on this story:
