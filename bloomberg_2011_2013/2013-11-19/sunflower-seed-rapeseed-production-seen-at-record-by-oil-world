Global production of sunflower seeds
may be larger than estimated a month ago and rapeseed output
will reach a high as prospects improved for crops from  Canada  to
Russia, Oil World said.  Palm oil  supplies will also climb.  Sunflower seed production may be a record 40.2 million
metric tons, 600,000 tons higher than estimated a month ago and
13 percent larger than last year, the Hamburg-based researcher
said in an e-mailed report. World production of rapeseed and
canola may reach an all-time high 67.7 million tons in the
2013-14 season, including 21.01 million tons from the European
Union and 16.5 million tons in Canada, it said.  Rising production for everything from corn to canola this
season sapped crop prices globally, with rapeseed prices on NYSE
Liffe in Paris sliding 17 percent since Jan. 1. Oil World raised
its sunflower seed production forecasts for  Russia  and Ukraine
by a combined 500,000 tons, so that output in the world’s top
two growers probably will reach a record 19.1 million tons, even
though excess rain slowed harvesting in recent months.  The “sunflower complex continues to be the weakest member
of the global oilseed balance thanks to the glut of this year’s
supplies in both the producing and the importing countries,”
Oil World said. “The ample world rapeseed availability only
adds to the bearish tone.”  Rapeseed planting in the European Union may be as low as
6.5 million hectares in 2014, about 3 percent below the prior
year, Oil World said. The biggest declines may occur in France
and  Germany , while planting also will probably drop in  Poland ,
the  Czech Republic  and the U.K. EU farmers usually plant winter
crops from August to October. The crop lies dormant over winter
and is harvested in summer.  Palm Oil  Global production of palm oil probably will be 58.73
million tons, 5.1 percent larger than a year earlier, including
30 million tons from  Indonesia  and 19.88 million tons from
 Malaysia , Oil World said. Inventories at the end of the 2013-14
season may rise 4.2 percent to 10.45 million tons.  “The global market will be less dependent on palm oil in
the 2013-14 season thanks to a steep increase in crushings and
corresponding increases in seed oil production,” primarily from
soybeans and sunflower seeds, Oil World said. “We expect that
there will be a setback in palm oil prices within the next four
to six weeks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
