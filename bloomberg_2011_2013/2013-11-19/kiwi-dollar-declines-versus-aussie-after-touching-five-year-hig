New Zealand ’s dollar fell against
its Australian counterpart from a five-year high after inflation
expectations in the smaller nation topped out this quarter,
damping the prospects for a rate increase.  The yield on Australia’s benchmark three-year government
remained lower after minutes of the  Reserve Bank ’s Nov. 5
meeting showed policy makers kept the option of reducing rates
if needed. Both South Pacific currencies fell against the yen as
Asian stocks snapped a three-day advance.  Today’s data suggest that “maybe we are not in as
inflationary an environment in New Zealand as what we thought,”
said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  in Singapore. Investors taking profit on short Aussie-kiwi
positions has “probably been weighing on New Zealand dollar
sentiment in the near term.”  New Zealand’s currency fell 0.2 percent to NZ$1.1270 per
Aussie as of 3:20 p.m. in Sydney. The kiwi strengthened to as
high as NZ$1.1198 yesterday, a level not seen since October
2008. It dropped 0.1 percent to 83.24 U.S. cents. The Australian
dollar was little changed at 93.80 U.S. cents.  Inflation will average 2.34 percent in two years time,
according to the fourth-quarter survey of business  estimates 
published by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand today. Expectations
fell from 2.36 percent in the third quarter, the highest since
June 2012.  Australia ’s benchmark  three-year note yield  was little
changed at 3.06 percent. It has dropped 11 basis points since
Nov. 12.  “Given the substantial degree of policy stimulus that had
been imparted, it was prudent to hold the cash rate steady while
continuing to gauge the effects, but not to close off the
possibility of reducing it further should that be appropriate,”
the  Reserve Bank of Australia  said in the minutes released
today.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares was little changed
after climbing 3.2 percent in the past three days. The kiwi slid
0.3 percent to 83.06 yen, while the Aussie fell 0.2 percent to
93.61 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
