At least 21 people died in a suicide
attack by suspected al-Shabaab militants on a police station in
central Somalia, a police official said.  Seven Somali policemen and four Djiboutian members of an
African Union peacekeeping mission, known as Amisom, were killed
when a car bomb detonated today at the police station in
Beledweyne, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) north of the
capital, Mogadishu, Abdilkadir Osman, a police official, said in
a phone interview. Ten suspected al-Shabaab fighters died as
they tried to storm the base, Colonel Osman Dubad Sugulle, head
of Djiboutian forces in Somalia, said in a separate interview.  “This cowardly attack will not hamper the progress made in
central Somalia by the Somali security forces in partnership
with Amisom in eliminating the threat posed by al-Shabaab,”
Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said in an e-mailed statement.  In the past two years, government troops backed by about
17,000 African Union troops have pushed the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab militant group out of the capital, Mogadishu, and other
major towns. Last week, the United Nations Security Council
adopted a resolution approving an increase of more than 4,000
troops for the African Union mission, logistical support form
the UN to the Somali army and the deployment of a UN security
unit to protect UN compounds in the country.  Today’s bombing is the latest in a series of attacks that
follow the bombing of a hotel in Mogadishu on Nov. 8 and a June
strike against a UN compound in Mogadishu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
