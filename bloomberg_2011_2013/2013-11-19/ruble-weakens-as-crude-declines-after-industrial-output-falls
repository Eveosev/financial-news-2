The ruble weakened against the
dollar for the first time in five days after industrial
production unexpectedly declined and oil dropped.  The ruble depreciated 0.3 percent to 32.6635 by 2:03 p.m.
in Moscow. The yield on the government’s bonds due February
2027, known as OFZs, increased three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 7.80 percent.  Output fell 0.1 percent in October from a year earlier
after growth of 0.3 percent the previous month, according to
Federal Statistics Service data released yesterday. That missed
the median estimate of an 0.5 percent increase in a Bloomberg
survey of economists. Oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner,
declined 0.2 percent to $108.27 a barrel in  London .  “Weakening of Russia’s economic fundamentals remains a
problem for OFZs and the ruble,” Evgeny Koshelev, an analyst at
OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  in Moscow, said in an e-mailed note today.  Triggered by a 1.9 percent contraction in manufacturing,
the drop in industrial output signals any improvement in
economic growth from 1.2 percent in the third quarter is under a
question mark, according to Vladimir Kolychev, chief economist
for Russia at VTB Capital in Moscow. Gross domestic product
growth will probably miss the government’s 1.8 percent target
this year, Economy Minister Alexey Ulyukayev told reporters on
Nov. 13.  The ruble weakened 0.4 percent against the euro to 44.1450
and dropped 0.4 percent against the central bank’s target basket
at to 37.8373. An index of the 20 most actively-traded emerging-market currencies gained for a fifth day, rising 0.1 percent to
93.4120, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The October output numbers still don’t mean the central
bank will cut  interest rates  sooner than the first quarter of
the next year, according to VTB Capital’s Kolychev. Bank Rossii
kept its main lending rate unchanged in November after a
surprise acceleration in inflation.  “The central bank is likely to take comfort in the fact
that there was no huge negative surprise,” Kolychev said in an
e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
