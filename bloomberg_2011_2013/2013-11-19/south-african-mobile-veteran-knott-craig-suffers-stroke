Alan Knott-Craig, a veteran of South
Africa’s telecommunications industry, has suffered a stroke
while at the helm of Cell C Pty Ltd., the nation’s third-largest
wireless carrier.  He had “a minor stroke,” Vinnie Santu, a spokeswoman for
Cell C, said yesterday in a statement. “He is currently
recovering in hospital and is responding well to treatment.”  Knott-Craig, 61, was the founding chief executive officer
of  Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD)  in 1993. Cell C Chief Commercial Officer
Jose Dos Santos will act as CEO until Knott-Craig returns to
work, according to the statement.  Vodacom expanded into countries such as Mozambique and
 Tanzania  under Knott-Craig’s leadership and gained 34 million
subscribers before his departure in 2008. He became CEO of Cell
C in 2012 with the goal of taking market share from Vodacom as
well as its largest competitor  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN)   Knott-Craig is fighting Vodacom and MTN to reduce the price
that Cell C pays to end calls on their networks. The fee, known
as mobile termination rates, will be halved to 20 cents ($0.02)
as of March 2014, the Independent Communications Authority of
South Africa regulator said last month. Vodacom and MTN are
seeking a compromise on the rate cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
