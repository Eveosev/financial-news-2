Natural gas futures fluctuated in
New York amid forecasts that a cold snap this week will be
followed by moderating weather heading into December, limiting
heating needs.  Gas moved between gains and losses as MDA Weather Services
in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted that a “dump of strong
cold” from Canada into the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. over
the next five days will be followed by more seasonal weather
from Nov. 29 through Dec. 3. The U.S. raised its gas production
estimate for 2013 as new wells came online in the Marcellus
shale in the Northeast, according to a report last week.  “It looks like the forecast is for only four to five days
of below normal-temperatures without sustained cold,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We are approaching December; I think
that is going to provide support. There is so much gas around,
the market is having trouble sustaining rallies.”  Natural gas for December delivery slid 0.8 cent to $3.609
per million British thermal units at 10:11 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 11 percent below the
100-day average. Gas has advanced 7.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
