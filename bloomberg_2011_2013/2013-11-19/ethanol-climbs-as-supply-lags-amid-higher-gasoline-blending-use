Ethanol gained for a second day on
speculation that increased demand for gasoline will spur
consumption of the biofuel.  The additive’s discount to the motor fuel contracted 4.83
cents to 80.35 cents a gallon, higher than the 57.15 cents
averaged so far this year. Gasoline  demand  over the past four
weeks was 4.7 percent above a year ago as of Nov. 8, data from
the Energy Information Administration show.  “It’s tight,” said Julie Ward, an assistant vice
president at R.J. O’Brien & Associates, a broker in  Des Moines ,
 Iowa . “Demand is still good. With ethanol trading almost a buck
under gasoline, refiners should be blending as much as they
can.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 3.1 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $1.836 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the highest settlement since Oct. 25. Prices have fallen 16
percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery fell 1.73 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.6395 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is produced from corn in the U.S. Prices for the
grain have fallen 40 percent this year as farmers planted a
record crop to recover from last year’s drought.  Persuading farmers to sell corn at current prices is a
challenge for ethanol producers and might hamper efforts to
raise output, Ward said.  Corn Prices  Corn for December delivery advanced 5.75 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $4.1775 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, or the price difference between the
cost of a bushel of corn and the price of ethanol was 32 cents,
up from 31 cents yesterday, compared with minus 33 cents on Jan.
3, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “As long as stocks are still tight and it’s trading at a
buck under gasoline, margins are going to be good,” Ward said.  Ethanol  production  rose 2.8 percent to 927,000 barrels a
day in the week ended Nov. 8, the most since February 2012,
according to data from the EIA, the Energy Department’s
analytical arm.  Stockpiles were 15.2 million barrels, down 26 percent from
this year’s high in January.  The agency is scheduled to release the latest supply and
production estimates at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  RINs Prices  Refiners are required to use 13.8 billion gallons of
ethanol this year. Compliance is tracked by Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs.  Corn-based-ethanol RINs rose 1 cent to 18 cents, while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, were unchanged at 21 cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in Chicago at
$2.225 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf at $2.325, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. In New York, the additive lost 2.5 cents to
$2.325 and on the West Coast, the biofuel decreased 2 cents to
$2.325.  West Coast ethanol was at parity with the Gulf from a
premium of 2 cents yesterday, and Chicago’s discount to  New York 
Harbor narrowed 2.5 cents to 10 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
