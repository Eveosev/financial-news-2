Israel ’s benchmark bonds fell,
pushing yields to the highest in almost two months as trading
resumed after a general strike and the country posted its widest
trade deficit since at least 1995.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit government
bonds due January 2022 rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 4.58 percent at 2:40 p.m. in  Tel Aviv , matching the
level on Dec. 18. Israel’s local financial markets opened for
trading today for the first time since Feb. 7 after a closure
due to a general strike.  A drop in exports led the trade deficit, excluding polished
diamonds, ships and aircraft, to widen to a seasonally adjusted
$2.19 billion from $1.33 billion the previous month, the
statistics bureau said. Exports fell 6.3 percent in January
compared with a 0.2 percent decline a month earlier. In  Greece ,
Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  appealed to citizens yesterday to
support deep budget cuts to win a second aid package. The cost
of insuring European sovereign debt soared last week.  “The market is catching up with trading in global markets
after being closed for two days,” said Sagie Poznerson, head of
trading at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Yields are
on a rising trend as there is still much uncertainty about the
European debt crisis which is affecting Israeli exports and
economic growth.”  Slower Growth  Economic growth slowed in the second half of 2011 to 3
percent from 4 percent in the first six months of the year, the
Bank of Israel said today. The central bank and the  finance
ministry  have reduced their growth forecasts for this year,
citing the impact of the European debt crisis. Exports comprise
about 40 percent of Israel’s gross domestic product, with  Europe 
and the U.S. the biggest trading partners.  The yield on the CPI-linked bonds due June 2013 rose two
basis points to 0.26 percent. The one-year break-even rate, the
yield difference between inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate
government notes of similar maturity, increased six basis points
to 225, the highest in two months, implying an average annual
inflation rate of 2.25 percent.  Two-year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of  investor
expectations for rates  in the period, fell one basis point to
2.65 percent on Feb. 10. The  Bank of Israel , which cut the
benchmark lending rate to 2.5 percent on Jan. 23, is willing to
make further interest rate cuts if growth slows, Governor
 Stanley Fischer  said Jan. 26.  The shekel weakened 0.4 percent to 3.7211 on Feb. 10. The
 Tel-Bond 40 Index  of corporate bonds dropped 0.2 percent to
263.54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
