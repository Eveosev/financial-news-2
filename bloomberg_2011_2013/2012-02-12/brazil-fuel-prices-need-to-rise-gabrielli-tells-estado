Brazil  will need to increase fuel
prices at some point, given the current gap between domestic and
international prices is unsustainable,  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) 
Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli told O Estado de
S.Paulo.  Gabrielli, who will be officially replaced tomorrow, said
the gap led profit at Brazilâ€™s state-controlled oil company to
decline in the fourth quarter, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
