The  Kimberley Process  has authorized
Zimbabweâ€™s Diamond Mining Co. (Pvt) Ltd. to sell gems from the
Marange diamond fields, the state-controlled  Sunday Mail  said,
citing the secretary for mines, Prince Mupazviriho.  DMC is a joint-venture between the state-owned Zimbabwe
Mining Development Corp. and an unidentified foreign investor,
the Harare-based Sunday Mail said on its website. DMC is
expected to produce about 25 million carats of gems annually,
the Sunday Mail added. The Kimberley Process is an organization
that monitors the sale of so-called  conflict diamonds .  To contact the reporter on this story:
