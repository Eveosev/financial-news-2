Jeremy Lin hit a free throw with 4.9
seconds remaining to give the  New York  Knicks the lead in a 100-
98 victory over the  Minnesota Timberwolves  in a National
Basketball Association contest.  Lin, who has scored at least 20 points in each of the
Knicks’ season-high five straight wins, tallied 15 points in the
first half against five in the final two quarters. Still, his
free throw put the Knicks ahead 99-98 and Bill Walker sealed the
win with his own foul line point with one second left.  “It was an ugly one, it was a gutsy one, it was
a road win,” Lin told reporters. “Everybody was tired. But
that’s the duty of basketball. We never gave up. I struggled a
lot tonight but I mean everyone who came in gave us a lift and
picked us up.”  The Knicks are playing without the injured  Carmelo Anthony 
and Amar’e Stoudemire who attended his brother’s funeral
yesterday.  Kevin Love , who scored 32 points and pulled down 21
rebounds, missed a 23-foot 3-pointer that would have given the
Timberwolves the win at the buzzer. Nikola Pekovic had 21 points
and 13 rebounds and Ricky Rubio scored 12 points.  Reserve Iman Shumpert had 20 points and Landry Fields had
19 for the Knicks, who were losing 62-54 at halftime after being
behind by as many as 11 points.  “We knew that guys were tired and we knew that this was a
hump game that we had to get over,” Fields said. “It was an
emotional win for us.”  The combination of point guards Lin and Rubio drew 20,232
fans to Target Center in  Minneapolis , the largest crowd since
2004.  The Knicks (13-15) are third, six games behind the
 Philadelphia 76ers  in the Eastern Conference’s five-team
Atlantic Division.  The Timberwolves (13-15) are fifth in the Western
Conference’s five-team Northwest Division, 8 1/2 games behind
the Oklahoma City Thunder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
