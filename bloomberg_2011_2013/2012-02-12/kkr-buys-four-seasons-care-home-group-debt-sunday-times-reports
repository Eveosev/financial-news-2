KKR & Co. , the private equity firm
run by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , bought some of the loans
of Four Seasons Health Care Group Ltd., a U.K. nursing home
operator, the Sunday Times of London reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Purchasing the debt may mean KKR can present a
restructuring plan as Four Seasons renegotiates its borrowings,
allowing the private equity firm to gain a controlling stake in
the company, the newspaper reported. A KKR spokeswoman declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
