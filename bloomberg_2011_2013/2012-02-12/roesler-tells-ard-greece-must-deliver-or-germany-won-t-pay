German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said the lower house of parliament in Berlin can call
off a special meeting on Feb. 27 to approve more aid for  Greece 
if the Greek government and opposition parties fail to live up
to their commitments today.  The meeting that’s scheduled to approve  Germany ’s
contribution to the second aid package for Greece “only makes
sense if Greece has shown before, through legal measures and
deeds, that it’s worth it,” Roesler said in an interview on ARD
public television. “If that doesn’t happen, there won’t need to
be a session.”  Asked whether today’s parliamentary meeting in Athens is
decisive for future German aid, Roesler said Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government wants to see full support by all Greek
parties for the economic adjustment program the government has
agreed to.  An advance transcript of Roesler’s comments on  ARD , to be
broadcast at 6:30 p.m. today, was e-mailed to news
organizations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
