The cost of renting a home in
central London fell in January from the previous month while
remaining higher than a year earlier,  Knight Frank LLP  said.  Residential rents fell 0.2 percent in January from December
and 0.6 percent from an all-time peak in September because of
job losses in the  City of London , according to an  index  compiled
by the real estate company. January rents were 7 percent higher
than a year earlier.  “Tenants who are building deposits for eventual entry to
the housing market are looking to reduce their rental costs,”
 Liam Bailey , head of residential research at Knight Frank, said
in a statement. “Our view looking ahead is that rents will
begin to rise slightly from the spring onwards.”  The cost of renting, which slid 20 percent between March
2008 and June 2009, jumped 27 percent in the two years to
September, reaching the highest level ever, Bailey said.  “At best, disposable income even in central  London , only
rose by around 8 percent over the same period,” he said.
“Landlords are having to accept that continually rising rents
are not a fixture of the market.”  The company doesn’t anticipate “significant rises from
here,” Bailey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
