Swiss banks may have to pay higher
amounts to the U.S. to resolve a tax dispute than the $780
million fine  UBS AG (UBSN)  agreed to pay in 2009,  Der Sonntag  reported,
citing unidentified banking sources.  The 11 banks that are the focus of the U.S. Justice
Department review must each negotiate a so-called deferred
prosecution agreement with the authorities, Der Sonntag said,
citing Mario Tuor, a spokesman for the Swiss State Secretariat
for International Financial Matters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
