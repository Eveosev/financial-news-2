German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said it’s up to the Greeks to decide whether they want
to stay in the euro area, the Welt am Sonntag newspaper
 reported .  Greece  would “remain in  Europe ” even if it left the euro,
Schaeuble said. While euro region governments want to avoid a
Greek exit and are ready to help, “others shouldn’t be given
the feeling that they don’t have to make an effort,” he said.  “Greece will be saved in one way or another,” Schaeuble
said. “But the country must do its homework to become
competitive” either within the framework of a new aid program
“or in another way that we actually don’t want.”  The Greek government must take measures to prevent the
country from becoming a bottomless pit as a precondition for aid
from euro members, Schaeuble said. The government must implement
its commitments under the first aid package before a second aid
program can be approved, Schaeuble said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
