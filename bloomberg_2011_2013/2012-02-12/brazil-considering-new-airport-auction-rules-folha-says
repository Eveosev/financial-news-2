Brazil  is considering new rules for
the next round of airport auctions because President  Dilma Rousseff  has concerns about the winners of last week’s bidding,
 Folha  de Sao Paulo reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  The government is worried that some of the companies that
won the rights to manage the Viracopos, Guarulhos and Brasilia
airports don’t have enough experience in the business, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said today.  A press officer at the presidential palace, who can’t be
identified because of internal policy, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
