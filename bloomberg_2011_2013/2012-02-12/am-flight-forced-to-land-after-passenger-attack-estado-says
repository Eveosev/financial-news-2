A  TAM SA (TAMM4)  flight en route to Sao
Paulo from Montevideo was forced to make an unplanned stop
yesterday after a 28 year-old passenger threatened to attack
crew members, O Estado de S. Paulo reported on its website.  The plane had to land in the southern city of  Porto Alegre 
because of an “uproar on board,” the company said in an e-
mailed statement.  The passenger, who wasn’t identified, was handed over to
federal police in Porto Alegre before the flight was resumed,
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
