The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations increased 11.57 cents to
$3.5101 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The price jump covers the three-week period ended Feb. 10
and is based on the Camarillo, California-based company’s survey
of about 2,500 stations. The price is 42.89 cents higher than a
year earlier, when the average was $3.0812.  Prices advanced as West Texas Intermediate crude rose 21
cents a barrel while Brent oil rose $7.45 a barrel over the
three-week period from the last survey,  Trilby Lundberg ,
president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. Brent was affected by declining North Sea production,
unrest in  Sudan  and  South Sudan  that has shut pipelines and
“skittishness” over  Iran  threatening to cut exports, she said.  “It is a fact that refiners are more sensitive to what
European grades of crude such as Brent do than WTI,” Lundberg
said. “We are seeing strong dynamics in the crude oil market
beyond our shores.”  Gasoline futures jumped 19.05 cents a gallon on speculation
that refinery closures in  Europe , the U.S. and the Virgin
Islands would crimp supplies during the spring and summer peak
driving season.  The contract nearest to expiration on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  rose 6.8 percent to $2.9749 a gallon in the
three weeks ended Feb. 10.  Stockpiles Rose  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  increased 1.63 million barrels to
231.8 million in the week ended Feb. 3, according to the Energy
Department. Supplies were at an 11-month high and gained 14
percent since Nov. 4.  Deliveries to wholesalers  during the past four weeks were
6.8 percent below a year earlier while total fuel supplied was
down 4.8 percent.  Gasoline demand at the pump in the week ended Feb. 3 sank
2.8 percent from the prior week and was more than 5 percent
below year-earlier levels for the third straight week, according
to  MasterCard (MA)  Inc.’s SpendingPulse report on Feb. 7. Consumption
during the previous four weeks was 4.9 percent below a year
earlier, the 48th consecutive decline in that measure.  Crude May Rise  Crude prices may rise this week after U.S. refineries
processed more crude, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Operating
rates at plants climbed 1 percentage point to 82.8 percent of
capacity in the week ended Feb. 3, the first gain in four weeks,
according to department data.  Nineteen of 36 analysts, or 53 percent, forecast oil will
climb through Feb. 17. Eight respondents, or 22 percent,
predicted prices will decline and nine estimated there will be
little change. It was the most bullish response since April.  Crude oil  supplies  rose 304,000 barrels to 339.2 million in
the seven days through Feb. 3, according to the department, the
highest level since October.  Inventories (DOESCROK)  at Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
the delivery point for New York-traded West Texas Intermediate
oil, increased 367,000 barrels to 30.5 million, the third
consecutive gain.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline increased 15.15 cents to
an average of $3.82 a gallon, which was the highest price in the
lower 48 U.S. states among the cities surveyed, Lundberg said.
Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.81 a gallon, a
1.28-cent increase from the last survey.  The lowest price was in Denver, where customers paid an
average of $3.01, a 5.54-cent rise, Lundberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
