Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  forecast that
Germany, western  Europe ’s biggest mobile-service market, will
resume growth after years of stagnation as the introduction of
faster networks spurs data use.  “Data growth will be so dramatic that, despite all the
discussion about termination charges and despite the
competition, this will once again be a big and well-off growth
market,” Friedrich Joussen, chief of Vodafone’s German
business, told reporters late Feb. 9 in Dusseldorf.  Vodafone will price mobile-phone access to its faster so-
called long-term evolution, or LTE, network at a premium of 10
euros ($13.20) a month for its two most expensive packages, he
said. The company last week said it will be the first wireless
provider to offer LTE phones in  Germany .  The German wireless market is the largest national market
for Newbury, U.K.-based Vodafone. It has shrunk twice in the
last three years and is estimated to grow 0.9 percent this year,
according to Maurice Shahd, a spokesman at Bitkom, the country’s
technology and telecommunications association. Revenue has been
under pressure by regulators seeking to cut termination charges,
which is the fee operators are allowed to charge for calls
coming into their networks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
