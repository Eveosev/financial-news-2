The U.S. eliminated  Switzerland  in
the first round of tennis’s Davis Cup to join defending champion
Spain, the Czech Republic and Argentina in the quarterfinals.  Mike Bryan and Mardy Fish defeated Roger Federer and
Stanislas Wawrinka 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 to give the U.S. an
unbeatable 3-0 lead in the best-of-five series in Fribourg,
Switzerland.  The U.S. won both singles matches as  John Isner , ranked
17th on the ATP World Tour, beat No. 3 Federer and 8th-ranked
Fish defeated Wawrinka.  The U.S., which has won a record 32 titles in the top team
competition for men’s tennis, will meet France in the
quarterfinals in April. France took a 2-1 lead over Canada when
it won the doubles match yesterday in Vancouver.  Spain, the  Czech Republic  and Argentina all won their
doubles matches to take 3-0 leads.  Spain’s Marc Lopez and Marcel Granollers beat Evgeny Korolev and Yuriy Schukin of Kazakhstan in straight sets. Spain
will next face either Russia or Austria. Russia trails that
matchup 2-1 after winning yesterday’s match in four sets.  The Czech Republic won in straight sets over Italy to set
up a quarterfinal against Sweden or Serbia, which holds a 2-1
lead.  Argentina clinched its series with Germany with a five-set
victory and will next play Croatia or Japan. Croatia leads 2-1
after a four-set win yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
