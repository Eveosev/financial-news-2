The city-state of Hamburg may become
the largest shareholder of shipping company Hapag-Lloyd AG,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, without citing a source
for the information.  Hamburg may pay 420 million euros ($555 million) to  TUI AG (TUI1) 
to boost its stake in Hapag-Lloyd to more than 37 percent from
23.6 percent, the newspaper said in an advance copy of an
article in tomorrow’s edition.  Billionaire shipping magnate Klaus-Michael Kuehne is ready
to pay TUI 160 million euros to increase his 24.6 percent stake
while insurers Hanse-Merkur and Signal Iduna plan to pay 13
million euros and 7 million euros respectively for shares in the
shipping company held by TUI, the newspaper said.  The plans are part of an agreement with TUI that may be
completed on Feb. 14, FAZ said. TUI’s stake in Hapag-Lloyd will
probably shrink to around 20 percent from 38.4 percent, the
newspaper said.  Daniel Stricker, a spokesman for Hamburg’s financial
authority, and Robin Zimmermann, a spokesman for  TUI AG (TUI1) , both
said separately that TUI and Hamburg-based Albert Ballin’s
investment group, which comprises Hamburg’s state government,
Kuehne, Signal Iduna, Hanse-Merkur, M.M. Warburg & Co. and HSH
Nordbank AG, are in “advanced talks.”  Details reported on the stakes are “pure speculation,”
said Stricker, who also said he can’t exclude that TUI may make
an announcement on a possible agreement on Feb. 15 at its annual
shareholder meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
