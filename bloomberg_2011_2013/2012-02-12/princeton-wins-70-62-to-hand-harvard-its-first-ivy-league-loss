Ian Hummer had 20 points as
 Princeton University  handed No. 21  Harvard University  its first
Ivy League Conference loss of the season, 70-62, in a men’s
college basketball game.  Hummer rallied to help Princeton break Harvard’s nine-game
winning streak last night after going 0 for 11 from the field in
the previous night’s 59-47 win over Dartmouth College.  “To get the first shot to go down tonight was quite a bit
different from yesterday,” Hummer told reporters. “I just knew
shots were gonna come my way.”  T.J. Bray added 12 points for the Tigers (13-10, 4-3 in Ivy
League), who haven’t lost to Harvard on their home court at L.
Stockwell Jadwin Gymnasium since 1989. Brendan Connolly scored
12 points and Mack Darrow and Denton Koon had 10 each.  Keith Wright  had 16 points and 12 rebounds for the Crimson
(21-3, 7-1 Ivy League), Brandyn Curry scored 15 points and Kyle
Casey added 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
