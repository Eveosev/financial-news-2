Citigroup Inc. said it’s “too

gains this year increase investor nervousness.  “Valuations remain supportive of equity markets” while
“liquidity continues to improve globally,” Citigroup analysts
led by  Markus Rosgen  wrote in a report dated today. The
“outperformance” of risk has further to go until caution is
required, they wrote. “We would be a buyer of corrections.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
