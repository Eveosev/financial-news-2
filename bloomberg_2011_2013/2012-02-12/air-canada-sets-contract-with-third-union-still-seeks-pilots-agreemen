Air Canada (AC/A)  reached its third union
contract agreement in three days today, while pilots voted on
whether to authorize a strike.  The Canadian Airline Dispatchers Association, which
represents 74 workers at the airline’s operations control center
in Toronto, reached a tentative deal with the company, according
to a joint statement released today. The deal must be approved
by a vote of the union’s members.  Canada ’s largest airline, based in Dorval,  Quebec , made a
pact on Feb. 10 with its biggest union, the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The IAMAW
represents about 8,600 mechanics, baggage handlers and cargo
agents. The Canadian Auto Workers, which represents 75 in-flight
crew schedulers, signed a deal yesterday.  The  Air Canada (AC/B)  Pilots Association, which has about 3,000
working members, has yet to reach an agreement with the airline
after the pilots rejected a previous tentative deal in May. The
union began a five-day strike-authorization vote Feb. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
