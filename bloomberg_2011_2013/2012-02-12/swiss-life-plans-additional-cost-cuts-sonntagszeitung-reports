Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  will reveal
additional cost-cutting measures later this year even as it will
present better-than-expected earnings on Feb. 29,
 SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing three unidentified people close
to the board of directors.  The insurance company is working on a plan similar to its
2010 Milestone program that will be presented at an investor day
in November, the Zurich-based newspaper said. Swiss Life had at
the end of last year achieved 95 percent of its targets for the
current cost-reduction program, SonntagsZeitung said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
