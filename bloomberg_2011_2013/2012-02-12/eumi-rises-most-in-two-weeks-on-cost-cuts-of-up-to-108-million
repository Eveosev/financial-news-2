Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI)  rose the
most in two weeks after the board of the countryâ€™s largest
lender by assets approved measures that will cut costs by as
much as 400 million shekels ($108 million) a year.  The  shares  advanced 2.5 percent, the most since Jan. 26 in
intraday trading, to 12.25 shekels at 11:47 a.m. in  Tel Aviv .  The steps will include eliminating about 800 jobs, according
to an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
