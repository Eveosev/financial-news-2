Tiger Woods made five birdies in six
holes to shoot a 5-under 67 that elevated him to third place
from 17th, four shots behind leader Charlie Wi at the  Pebble
Beach  National Pro-Am Tournament.  Wi, who is looking for his first PGA Tour victory after 162
previous tries, was bogey-free as he shot a 3-under 69 today at
Spyglass Hill to take a three-stroke lead. After 54 holes, he is
15-under at 199.  “I enjoy being in the lead,” Wi, of  South Korea , told
reporters. “It’s a lot more fun than trying to come from behind.
I know that tonight is going to be very exciting, and I’m sure I
won’t sleep as well as if I’m in 50th place. But that’s what we
play for, and I’m really excited.”  Wi said his mental state will help dictate if he can
maintain the lead in tomorrow’s final round.  “I’m sure I’ll be fighting my demons all day tomorrow and
it’s how I handle myself tomorrow,” Wi said. “It’s not what
other players are doing. How I handle myself tomorrow is going
to be the outcome of the tournament.”  With an 11-under 203 after three rounds, Woods is the
closest he has been to the lead in a  PGA Tour  event since the
Masters in 2010.  “The ultimate goal is to win a golf tournament,” said
Woods who played today’s round at Pebble Beach.  Ken Duke, who hasn’t won a PGA Tour event in 142 starts,
shot a 65 at Monterey Peninsula to take second place with a 12-
under 202.  ‘Really Fun’  “It’s really fun, especially when the big guys are up
there,” Duke said. “That’s when everyone is out there
watching.”  Phil Mickelson  shot a 70 at Pebble Beach to tie for fourth
place, six strokes back. Also at 9-under 205 are Brendon Todd,
 Dustin Johnson ,  Hunter Mahan  and Kevin Na.  Woods hasn’t had an official PGA Tour win in more than two
years. He ended a 749-day winless drought with a victory in
December at the Chevron World Challenge, a limited-field event
he hosts in  California .  Woods last played at Pebble Beach during the 2010  U.S. Open ,
where he tied for fourth. When he won the tournament in 2000 he
came from five back against Matt Gogel in the final round, four
months before posting a 15-stroke victory in the U.S. Open at
the course.  The professionals play the final round tomorrow at Pebble
Beach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
