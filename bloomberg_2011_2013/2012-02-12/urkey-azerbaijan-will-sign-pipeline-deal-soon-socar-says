Turkey and  Azerbaijan  will “soon”
agree on construction of a pipeline that will carry natural gas
to  Europe , potentially rivaling the European Union-backed
Nabucco project, an Azeri energy official said.  An intergovernmental agreement on the trans-Anatolia
pipeline, also known as TANAP, is expected during Turkish Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s planned visit to Baku, State Oil
Co. of Azerbaijan President Rovnaq Abdullayev said in an
interview on private ANS television today.  The countries signed a memorandum of understanding in
December on building the 2,000-km pipeline, estimated to cost 7
billion euros ($9.25 billion). The pipeline, which will have a
capacity of 16 billion cubic meters a year, will connect
Turkey’s eastern border to the west.  Abdullayev said TANAP will deliver Azeri gas to western
 Turkey , where the fuel will be taken up by Nabucco or other
smaller volume projects that are vying for export rights.  A decision on the transit project is due by the end of the
first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
