The mayor of the German city of
Duisburg was voted out of office today in a referendum a year
and a half after 21 people lost their lives at the Love Parade
music festival,  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  reported.  In a vote organized by a citizens’ initiative, 129,833
Duisburg citizens said Mayor Adolf Sauerland should go, more
than the roughly 92,000 votes required for his ouster and
compared with the 21,557 people who wanted the mayor to keep his
job, DPA said. Sauerland had rejected public calls to step down,
saying he wasn’t responsible for the mass panic, DPA said.  On July 24, 2010, hundreds of thousands of people filing
into a concert venue at an abandoned train station created a
bottleneck in a tunnel and on an entrance ramp and the deaths
and injuries occurred when people were crushed as the crowd
pushed forward to enter the site. In addition to those who died,
hundreds were injured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
