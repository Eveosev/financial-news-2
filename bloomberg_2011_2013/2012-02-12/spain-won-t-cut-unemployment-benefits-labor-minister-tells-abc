Spain  won’t reduce benefit payments
for the unemployed, Labor Minister Fatima Banez told ABC
newspaper in an  interview .  “Unemployment benefit is a right of the workers and this
government isn’t going to touch it,” the newspaper cited her as
saying.  Spain’s Cabinet last week approved a law reducing
companies’ firing costs and making it easier for them to opt out
of wage-bargaining agreements in a bid to tackle the jobless
rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
