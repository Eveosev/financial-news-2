Three of  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ’s largest
investors,  Standard Life Plc (SL/) , M&G Investment Management Ltd. and
Sanderson Asset Management Ltd., will back the company’s board
on recommendations for pay, the Sunday Times reported, citing
interviews with, and statements from, the fund managers.  Stelios Haji Ioannou, who owns about 38 percent of the
company, will vote against the pay proposals as he thinks they
are too generous, the newspaper said, citing an interview. The
pay plan could award 10 executives with shares worth 8 million
pounds ($12.6 million) in three years if the carrier hits
targets, the newspaper said.  -- Editors: Alex Devine, Jonas Bergman  To contact the reporter on this story:
