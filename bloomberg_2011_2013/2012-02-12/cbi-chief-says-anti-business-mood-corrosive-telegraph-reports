Sir  Roger Carr , president of the
Confederation of British Industry, told the  Sunday Telegraph  the
position of business was being weakened by the debate on
executive pay.  “The corrosive voice of anti-business sentiment feeds the
view that all banks are despicable; all energy companies rip you
off; all boardrooms are populated by cronies; and all in private
equity are asset strippers,” he said in an interview with the
paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
