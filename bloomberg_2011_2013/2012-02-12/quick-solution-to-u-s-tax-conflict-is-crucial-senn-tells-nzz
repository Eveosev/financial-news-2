A quick and sustainable solution to
a U.S. tax conflict is “crucial” for Zurich Financial Services
AG’s U.S. business,  NZZ am Sonntag  reported, citing Martin Senn,
the Swiss insurer’s chief executive officer.  It’s important to maintain a “friendly dialogue” since 40
percent of the company’s business comes from the U.S. and one-
third of its employees work there, Senn told the Zurich-based
newspaper.  He also said that the Wegelin & Co. dispute is “very
relevant” and that a “little of our reputation gets lost”
every time something like that happens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
