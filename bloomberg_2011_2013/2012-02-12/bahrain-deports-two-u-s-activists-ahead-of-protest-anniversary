Bahrain deported two U.S. activists
after they participated in an illegal opposition protest, the
Information Affairs Authority said.  Huwaida Arraf and Radhika Sainath arrived in the country a
few days ago and applied for a tourist visas “under false
pretenses” at the airport, the agency said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. It said the two women work with a
group called “Witness Bahrain” that promotes the activities of
the banned Bahrain Center for Human Rights.  The deportation came three days before the Feb. 14
anniversary of last year’s anti-government rallies carried out
by mostly Shiite demonstrators. The opposition plans a new push
to retake the Pearl Roundabout, the center of the 2011 rallies,
on Feb. 14. The roundabout has been demolished by the government
and the surrounding area turned into a restricted military zone.
Security has been beefed up in recent days with personnel and
armored vehicles.  The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights said in an e-
mailed statement that the two women were going to monitor the
protests. The group expressed “its deep concern as to the
implications of these deportations,” according to the
statement.  Shiites represent about two thirds of the nation’s
population, according to the U.S. State Department. Thirty-five
people died in the two months of protests last year, according
to the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
