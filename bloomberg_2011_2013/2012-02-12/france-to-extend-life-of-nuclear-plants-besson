French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  has
decided to extend the lifespan of  France ’s nuclear plants so
they can operate beyond 40 years, Industry Minister Eric Besson
said in an interview with Europe 1.  A decision to prolong the life of a plant would require
approval by nuclear-safety watchdog Autorite de Surete
Nucleaire, Besson said. Shutting France’s nuclear plants would
increase electricity prices, he said.  Sarkozy on Feb. 9 vowed to keep the Fessenheim nuclear
plant in eastern France open in opposition to  Francois Hollande ,
the Socialist Party presidential candidate, who has promised to
close the site because of safety concerns.  “The president has decided to ask all the operators to
position themselves to be able to prolong the lifespan of our
reactors and our nuclear plants beyond 40 years,” Besson said.
The decision doesn’t automatically mean an extension because the
regulator has the final say, according to the minister.  “It would be a waste to halt our reactors at 40 years,”
Besson said. Reducing the share of nuclear in French  power
generation  to 50 percent from 75 percent over 13 years would
lift electricity prices by 30 percent to 40 percent, he said.  A nuclear power exit would be “destructive” for French
industry because it would “strongly increase” electricity
prices and hurt consumer purchasing power, Besson said.
“There’s nothing reasonable about it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
