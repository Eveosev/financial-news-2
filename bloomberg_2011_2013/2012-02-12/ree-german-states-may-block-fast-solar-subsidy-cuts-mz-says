The German states of Saxony, Saxony-
Anhalt and Thuringia are opposed to rapid cuts in subsidies for
solar energy installations, Mitteldeutsche Zeitung  said , citing
a prime minister of one of the states.  The three are “on the side” of Environment Minister
Norbert Roettgen, who prefers a moderate reduction in subsidies
as opposed to Economy Minister Philipp Roesler, who favors a
more rapid cut, the newspaper reported, citing Thuringia Prime
Minister Christine Lieberknecht.  The law must pass the Bundesrat, the upper house of
parliament, where the states are represented, Lieberknecht told
the newspaper, adding the three states are ready to block the
law as a measure of last resort.  To contact the reporter on this story:
