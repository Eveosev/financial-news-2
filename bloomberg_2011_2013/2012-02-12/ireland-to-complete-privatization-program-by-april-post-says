Ireland’s government will by April
complete its planned privatization program for the European
Union,  European Central Bank  and  International Monetary Fund ,
the  Sunday Business Post  reported.  The so-called troika and the Irish government meet in April
for a review of the country’s progress under its bailout terms
and Bord Gais Energy, a unit of the state gas company, may be
the first to be privatized to raise cash, the Dublin-based paper
reported, citing an unidentified person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
