U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
is considering plans under which company executives might lose
as much as 30 percent of their pay if they don’t do their jobs
properly, the Independent on Sunday newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Cable put forward proposals last month to give shareholders
in the largest public companies a binding vote over executive
compensation to ensure failure is not rewarded. He said then
that the government would look at a requirement for “clawback”
clauses to be introduced in all contracts so pay can be
recovered if a company does badly, without giving any numbers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
