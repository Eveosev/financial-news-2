A number of employees at U.K. banks
were among people arrested as part of a tax-related
investigation, the country’s  customs and revenue service  said in
a statement, without providing further details.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Britain’s largest state-
controlled bank, said in a separate statement it was co-
operating with the HM Revenue & Customs inquiry.  “As a result of an ongoing investigation into tax-related
criminal offenses, HMRC has arrested a number of people, some of
whom work for U.K. banks,” a revenue service spokesman, who
asked not to be identified in line with department policy, said
by phone today. “This investigation relates to the actions of
the people arrested in relation to their own financial affairs
and is not connected to the business activities of the banks.”  The inquiry is in connection with the use of film finance
plans to evade taxes, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Film
investment has become a common way to claim tax relief, the
newspaper said.  “We cannot comment on an ongoing investigation but are
fully co-operating with HMRC,” RBS said in an e-mailed
statement today.  U.K taxpayers had been allowed to take advantage of tax
relief by investing in film production, a practice that was
limited to allow 25,000 pounds ($39,400) in tax relief a year
unless they were actively involved in the film, according to the
Telegraph.  The HMRC spokesman declined to say how many people had been
arrested or who they work for.  To contact the reporter on this story:
