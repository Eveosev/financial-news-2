U.S. stocks rose, after the first
weekly loss for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in 2012, as
Greece approved austerity plans to secure rescue funds.  Bank of America Corp. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Caterpillar
Inc. (CAT)  increased at least 1.7 percent to lead gains in the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average .  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  climbed 1.9 percent to
trade above $500 for the first time. Chesapeake Energy Corp.
added 2.4 percent after the natural-gas driller said it’s
targeting as much as $12 billion in asset sales and joint
ventures this year.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  surged 3.4
percent after being raised at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  The S&P 500 advanced 0.7 percent to 1,351.77 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time. The Dow increased 72.81 points, or 0.6 percent, to
12,874.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1 percent to
2,931.39, the highest level since 2000. The Russell 2000 Index
of small companies climbed 1.4 percent to 824.81.  “This has been a risk-on rally,”  Mike Ryan , the New York-
based chief investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management
Americas, said in a telephone interview. “The fact that the
Greek Parliament was able to push through the austerity measures
was widely expected. This eliminates one of the stumbling
blocks, but it doesn’t solve the Greek issue. Our view is that
Greece is going to struggle to make payments going forward.”  Today’s rally put the  S&P 500  less than 1 percent away from
its peak nine months ago of  1,363.61 , which was the highest
level since June 2008. The index has climbed 7.5 percent in
2012, on expectations the global economy will withstand the
impact of the euro area’s debt crisis.  From the Brink  Global stocks gained today as Germany and the European
Commission welcomed Greek approval of the austerity steps
demanded for a financial lifeline, suggesting euro finance
chiefs will pull Greece back from the brink when they meet in
two days.  “I’m confident that the other conditions, including for
instance the identification of the concrete measures of 325
million euros ($430 million), will be completed by the next
meeting” of finance ministers, EU Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner Olli Rehn said.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
the economy gained 1.1 percent. Caterpillar, the largest
construction and mining-equipment maker, rose 1.7 percent to
$113.70. The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  added 0.8 percent as 19 of its 24
stocks advanced. Bank of America rose 2.2 percent to $8.25.
JPMorgan advanced 1.8 percent to $38.30.  Apple Rallies  Apple added 1.9 percent to $502.60, after rallying for four
straight weeks. On Jan. 24, the largest technology company
reported quarterly profit that more than doubled. Its  earnings 
are expanding so fast that even with the rally, the shares are
trading at less than half their median  valuation  since 1990,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The gain since Apple reported
results is almost four times as large as the advance in the
Nasdaq 100 Index.  “It reminds us all of the amazing transformation of Apple
over the past eight years,”  Timothy Ghriskey , who oversees $2
billion as chief investment officer of Solaris Group LLC in
Bedford Hills, New York, said in a telephone interview today.
“We think the stock has higher to go, $600 is next,” he said.  Chesapeake (CHK)  added 2.4 percent to $22.66. The sales will help
the company reduce debt and fund its drilling operations as it
faces gas prices that hit a 10-year low in New York last month.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Aubrey McClendon  has vowed
to cut long-term debt 25 percent by year end as the company
reduces output.  AMD, Regeneron  Advanced Micro Devices surged 3.4 percent to $7.29. The
maker of processors for personal computers was raised to
“outperform” from “market perform” at Sanford C. Bernstein.  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN)  jumped 12 percent, the most
in the  Russell 1000 Index , to $114.65 as the company raised its
sales forecast for the eye drug Eylea to exceed analyst
estimates.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  tumbled 5 percent, the biggest decline in
the S&P 500, to $41.72 after being downgraded to “hold” from
“buy” at Brigantine Advisors.  AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC)  sank 3.6 percent to $37.21. The
drug distributor said Chief Financial Officer Michael DiCandilo
left the company. The company was cut to “neutral” from
“outperform” at Robert W. Baird & Co.  U.S. stocks may extend gains this year and mirror the
performance of 1995, when the S&P 500 rallied 34 percent even
after Mexico devalued its currency and Treasury yields dropped,
Laszlo Birinyi said.  Investor Sentiment  Improved investor sentiment, central-bank actions and
optimism that U.S. economic data will beat estimates, will
sustain gains even after the best January for the S&P 500 since
1997, the president of Birinyi Associates Inc. in Westport,
Connecticut, said in a Bloomberg Television interview today.  “We still think you should buy stocks,” the  fund manager 
said in  London . “It’s a continuation of the  bull market  and
we’re encouraged by what we are seeing in Europe. I look at the
markets, I find they are strong. There’s real buying going on.
This is not short-covering or a temporary or transitory thing.”  The fund manager reiterated recommendations to buy  General
Motors Co. (GM) ,  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) ,  Hermes International (RMS) ,
 People’s United Financial Inc. (PBCT)  and  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)   To contact the reporter on this story:
