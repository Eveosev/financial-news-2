German tank manufacturers Krauss-
Maffei Wegmann and  Rheinmetall (RHM)  hope to win a contract for the
delivery of the armored vehicles to the  United Arab Emirates ,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing industry officials it didn’t name.  The U.A.E. plans to acquire as many as 600 vehicles for as
much as 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion), the newspaper said. The
companies plan to make a bid through their Artec consortium,
which builds a wheeled armored vehicle that’s used by  Germany 
and the Netherlands, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
