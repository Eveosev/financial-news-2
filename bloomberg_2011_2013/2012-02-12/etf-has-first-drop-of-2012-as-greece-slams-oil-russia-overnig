The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a
U.S.-traded fund that holds Russian shares, declined for the
first week this year as concern Greece will derail Europe’s
debt-crisis recovery cut prices for oil and other commodities.  The exchange-traded fund lost 3.7 percent last week to
$30.71, the biggest drop in eight weeks to complete the first
weekly slide since Dec. 30.  Futures (VEA)  expiring in March on
Moscow’s  RTS index (RTSI$)  were little changed at 159,765 in U.S.
trading on Feb. 10, as coal producer  OAO Mechel (MTL)  and Internet
company  Yandex NV (YNDX)  led a 1.9 percent decline on the  Bloomberg
Russia-US 14 Index  of Russian companies traded in  New York .  Crude, Russia’s biggest export earner, retreated from a
three-week high and copper slipped the most in two months as
euro-area finance ministers refused to approve a second rescue
package for debt-laden Greece, boosting concern the European
crisis will cut demand for fuel and resources. The Russia ETF
lost 30 percent last year, the most since a 74 percent tumble in
2008, as oil had its smallest annual advance since 2006.  “European debt headlines aren’t going to go away easily,”
Aivaras Abromavicius, who helps manage $5.5 billion of eastern
European assets -- 66 percent of them in Russia -- at Stockholm-
based East Capital, said in an interview from Kiev, Ukraine on
Feb. 10. “Up until this week, European actions to address
liquidity and funding have been a source of renewed optimism for
Russian equities as well as  Turkey  and Hungary. We can only hope
that Greece and the EU can strike a deal to prevent a crisis.”  Cabinet Approval  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 1.2 percent to HK$6.55 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:01
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.2 percent
today after Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  obtained
approval from his Cabinet after U.S. markets closed on Feb. 10
for deeper budget cuts needed to secure a second bailout.  The approval capped a week of to-ing and fro-ing in Athens
as European Union and International Monetary Fund officials
argued with Greek government officials over conditions required
to secure the 130 billion-euro ($172 billion) rescue package.  Papademos reached agreement with the three party leaders
supporting his interim government on Feb. 9, only to be told by
euro-area finance ministers that the measures needed more work.  The Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index fell to 106.39 on Feb. 10,
the lowest level in six days, to leave it down 1.6 percent in
the week, the first weekly drop since the last five days of
December. The index has gained 17 percent in 2012 after losing
10 percent last year.  Rising Volatility  The  RTS Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in
the index futures, rose 12 percent to 32.43 points last week,
the most since the week ended Dec. 9.  American depositary receipts of  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY) , Russia’s
largest renewable energy producer, plunged 4.7 percent to $3.62
in New York on Feb. 10. The drop saw the ADRs trade at a
 discount  to RusHydro’s Moscow shares for the first time in two
weeks.  The company’s shares on Moscow’s 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF) 
dropped 3.1 percent to 1.0896 rubles on Feb. 10, the equivalent
of 3.63 U.S. cents. One ADR is equal to 100 ordinary shares.
RusHydro ADRs slid 7.9 percent last week, the most since the
five days to Dec. 9.  Crude for March delivery dropped 1.2 percent to $98.67 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as Brent oil futures
fell 1.1 percent to $117.31 on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, lost
0.8 percent to $117.87 to leave it down 2.9 percent last week.  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY) , Russia’s largest non-state oil producer, gained
for an eighth consecutive week, rising 0.6 percent to $60.53 in
New York. Lukoil  shares  on the Micex slipped 0.2 percent last
week to 1,809.80 rubles, or $60.28. One ADR represents one
ordinary share.  Mine Work Suspended  ADRs of  OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the world’s biggest natural gas
exporter and the largest stock on the Bloomberg Russia-U.S. 14
measure, declined 1.4 percent last week, the first weekly
retreat of the year, to $12.51 in U.S. trading, after  shares  in
Moscow dropped 1 percent to 1878.79 rubles, or $6.26. One ADR
represents two ordinary shares.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI index  of 24 raw materials fell 1
percent to 673.37 on Feb. 10, as copper and nickel retreated.
Copper futures for March delivery slipped 2.9 percent to $3.862
a pound on the Comex in New York, the biggest decline for a
most-active contract since Dec. 14.  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest coal producer for steelmakers,
capped its worst week since the five days ended Nov. 18,
plunging 6.8 percent to $10.68 on Feb. 10. Work was suspended at
several facilities at Mechel’s New-Olzherassk mine in Siberia by
order of the country’s safety regulator, according to a
statement from the company.  ‘Sweet Spot’  Mechel  shares  in Moscow fell 3.7 percent to 328.7 rubles,
or the equivalent of $10.94. One ADR represents one ordinary
share.  Yandex, operator of Russia’s most popular Internet search
engine, dropped 2.5 percent last week to $21.27, the first
weekly decline in four. The stock will probably rebound as risk
appetite returns and investors seek out the cheaper valuations
of Russian shares, analysts led by Peter Westin at Aton Llc in
Moscow wrote in a Feb. 10 report.  Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLZLY) , Russia’s biggest gold
producer, slipped 2 percent to $3.35 on Feb. 10 as the  Vedomosti 
newspaper reported that the owners of Polyus and  Polymetal
International Plc (PMTL)  had shelved a plan to merge the companies. The
shareholders may reopen talks at a later date, according to the
report. Polyus was down 4 percent in New York last week.  Russian stocks will benefit at the expense of equities in
 Turkey (XU100)  and  South Africa , according to Aton. “Russia is
currently in a sweet spot to receive rotation of funds” out of
emerging markets in Europe and Africa, the note said.  ‘More Cautious’  The Eastern European Trust Plc, the stock fund run by
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  that beat the regional  stock index  by 19
percentage points in the past three years, has cut holdings in
Russia before presidential elections scheduled for March 4. The
fund is buying equities Turkey.  “We’ve turned a little more cautious on Russia,” Sam Vecht, a London-based  money manager  at BlackRock, said in an
interview on Feb. 10.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  recorded its first weekly decline for 2012
last week, slipping 1.4 percent to 1,603.25 while the Micex lost
2.6 percent in the week to 1,524.58.  The Micex has gained 8.7 percent in 2011 and trades at 5.6
times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies. That
compares with a 13 percent advance for Brazil’s  Bovespa (IBOV)  index,
which trades at 10.3 times estimated earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  trades at
9.6 times estimated earnings, and the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) 
has a ratio of 15.7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
