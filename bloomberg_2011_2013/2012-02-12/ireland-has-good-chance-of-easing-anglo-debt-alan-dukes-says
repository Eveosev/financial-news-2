Ireland has a “good” possibility
of succeeding in easing conditions on the debt amassed from
rescuing the former  Anglo Irish Bank Corp (ANGL) ., Irish Bank
Resolution Corp. Chairman  Alan Dukes  said.  “The possibility in succeeding in getting alleviation on
that side is good,” Dukes told Dublin-based broadcaster  RTE 
today. “I have seen the result of action that has been taken up
to now, I hear the political signals that are coming out, I
think progress will be made on that.”  Ireland wants to refinance about 30 billion ($39.6 billion)
of promissory notes it used to rescue Anglo Irish Bank Corp., on
better terms and over a longer period. Anglo Irish was
nationalized in 2009. In late 2010 Ireland accepted an 85
billion euro aid package as the cost of bailing out its banks
became too much for the country to cope with.  To contact the reporter on this story:
