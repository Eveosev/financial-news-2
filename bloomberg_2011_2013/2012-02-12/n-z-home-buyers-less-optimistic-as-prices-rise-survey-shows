New Zealand home buyers are less
optimistic as a shortage of properties for sale bolsters prices,
ASB Bank Ltd. said, citing the results of a January survey.  The proportion of respondents expecting higher  home prices 
rose to 27 percent from 22 percent in the previous survey in
October, Auckland-based ASB said in an e-mailed report today.
Twenty percent said now is a good time to buy a house, down from
24 percent in the previous survey.  “The housing market still looks to be constrained by
supply, with recent data showing a decline in new house
listings,” ASB Chief Economist  Nick Tuffley  said in the report.
“The general tightening in the housing market shows signs of
feeding through into a recovery in house prices.”  New listings fell 2 percent in January following a 35
percent slump in December, with the number of homes for sale in
the nation’s three cities at four-year lows, according to
industry website realestate.co.nz. Rising prices may spark home
building and spending, helping an economic recovery that has
been sluggish in the past year.  House prices  may rise about 3 percent this year, Tuffley
said. The outlook for more expensive homes means ASB’s overall
housing confidence gauge declined, Tuffley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
