Candido Mendez, leader of  Spain ’s
General Workers Union, said the government of  Mariano Rajoy  is
acting as if it had already ceded control of economic policy to
the  International Monetary Fund , El Mundo reported.  “It’s as if Spain was a country that had been taken
over,” the newspaper cited Mendez as saying.  Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, head of the Commisiones Obreras
union, said he won’t immediately move to call a general strike,
as Rajoy has predicted, the newspaper quoted Toxo as saying.  Both leaders are set to meet Labor Minister Fatima Banez
tomorrow to discuss the government’s decision to reduce firing
costs and change wage-bargaining rules, El Mundo said.  Link to newspaper’s web site: { http://www.elmundo.es/ }  To contact the reporter on this story:
