Croatia ’s  Ivica Kostelic  retained
his World Cup super-combined title by winning the season’s final
race in the discipline and extended his lead in the overall
competition.  The 32-year-old, who trailed Switzerland’s Beat Feuz after
the downhill in Sochi, Russia, came out on top in the slalom to
finish 1.16 seconds ahead of his challenger. Thomas Mermillod-
Blondin of France was third.  With 15 of 44 races remaining in all disciplines, Kostelic
leads the  overall standings  by 70 points over Feuz. Still, the
defending champion suffered a suspected knee injury during
today’s slalom and had to go to the hospital, Agence France-
Presse reported, citing Vedran Pavlek, Croatia’s director of
alpine skiing.  France ’s Tessa Worley won the women’s giant slalom in
Soldeu-Grandvalira, Andorra, for her second straight victory in
the discipline. The 22-year-old beat Slovenia’s Tina Maze by
0.16 second, with Germany’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch another 0.59
seconds back.  Worley leads the giant slalom standings by 20 points over
Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany. Lindsey Vonn of the U.S., who
placed eighth today, is the overall leader with a 410-point
advantage over Maze.  To contact the reporter on this story:
