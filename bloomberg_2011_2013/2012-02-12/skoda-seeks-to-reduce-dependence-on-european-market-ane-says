  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Skoda brand is
seeking to lessen its dependence on the European market and grow
faster in Russia, India and  China ,  Automotive News Europe 
reported, citing Skoda’s sales chief Juergen Stackmann.  Car sales outside Europe may account for 60 percent of the
total by 2018, compared with 40 percent now, Stackmann said.
Skoda also wants to increase its western European market share
from about 3 percent at present, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
