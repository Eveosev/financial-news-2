Iran warned countries in the  Persian
Gulf  to avoid siding with the U.S. and refrain from
participating in any “plots” against the Iranian nation, the
state-run  Tehran Times  reported, citing parliamentary speaker
Ali Larijani.  “We advise certain governments in the region, which sided
with  Saddam Hussein  during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war and are
currently plotting against the Iranian nation along with the
U.S., to stop doing so,” Larijani was quoted as saying
yesterday, according to the Tehran-based newspaper. “The
Iranian nation’s forgiveness will not be repeated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
