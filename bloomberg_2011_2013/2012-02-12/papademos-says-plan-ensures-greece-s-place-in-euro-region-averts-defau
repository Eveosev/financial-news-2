Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
said an austerity and loan plan for  Greece  is credible, will
lead the country out of its crisis and ensure its place in the
euro area.                     “It’s a program that will lead the country to solid
ground,” Papademos told lawmakers in Athens before a vote on
the package. “It is the time for decisions, it is necessary to
understand that the main cause of the crisis is that for many
years the state systematically spent more than its revenue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
