The Jordanian central bankâ€™s foreign
currency reserves declined 14.1 percent to $10.5 billion last
year and are sufficient to cover imports for a little more than
six months, the bank said on its  website .  Total deposits at banks rose 8.3 percent in 2011 to 24.4
billion dinars ($34.4 billion), the report said. Credit
facilities extended by Jordanian banks increased 9.7 percent to
15.9 billion dinars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
