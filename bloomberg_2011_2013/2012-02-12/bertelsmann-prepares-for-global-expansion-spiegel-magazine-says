  Bertelsmann AG (BTG)  Chief Executive
Officer Thomas Rabe said he’s preparing for an international
expansion of  Europe ’s biggest media company that will boost the
number of units to as many as six from four within five years,
 Spiegel  magazine reported, citing an interview with Rabe.  Bertelsmann will be “more international and active in more
business areas,” Rabe told the magazine. The company wants to
expand into the education business in Europe, the U.S.,  Brazil ,
India and China, he said. Bertelsmann plans to build new
businesses together with partners and wants to avoid raising
debt to reach its expansion goals, Rabe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
