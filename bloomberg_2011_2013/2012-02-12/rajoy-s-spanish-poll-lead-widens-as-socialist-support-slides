Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
extended his lead over opposition Socialist Party, which saw its
support fall to the lowest level since at least April 2010, a
Metroscopia  opinion poll  published by El Pais showed.  The  People’s Party  of Rajoy saw its support slip to 46.2
percent from 46.4 percent in January, while the Socialists
dropped to 23 percent from 26.5 percent. The government’s
approval rating fell to 45 percent from 51 percent, according to
the poll of 1,003 people conducted Feb. 8 and 9.  Rajoy has raised taxes, breaching a campaign promise, and
announced measures to clean up the banking system after winning
power in November. He announced plans to cut the cost of firing
workers and make it easier to opt out of industrywide wage
agreements in labor market reforms announced Feb. 10.  The margin for error was plus or minus 3.2 percentage
points.  Link to poll:
