Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  is
working with its largest labor union to re-hire dismissed
employees and start production at the South African Rustenburg
mine that was closed by an illegal strike.  “Parties agreed to work together to ensure that all
workers get back to work,” the National Union of Mineworkers
said in an e-mailed statement. Impala, the world’s second-
biggest platinum producer, will on Tuesday begin hiring workers
it fired after the strike two weeks ago, union spokesman Lesiba
Seshoka said.  Impala Platinum on Feb. 2 fired 17,200 workers at its
Rustenburg mine, northwest of Johannesburg.  Bob Gilmour , a spokesman for Impala, confirmed by mobile
phone that the company has started re-hiring and said that
production will start as soon as possible.  To contact the reporter on this story:
