Volkswagen AG (VOW)  is seeking to choose a
site in  North America  for an Audi factory by mid-year, with
locations in  Mexico  and the U.S. still in the running, Michael Macht, VW’s production chief, told  Automotive News Europe .  VW has not determined which Audi model it will assemble at
the plant, ANE cited Macht as saying. The decision on where to
place the factory is closely linked with the company’s other
goal of bringing a Volkswagen sport-utility vehicle that’s
larger than the Tiguan to the U.S., he said.  There is no “clear preference” for a location at this
time, he said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
