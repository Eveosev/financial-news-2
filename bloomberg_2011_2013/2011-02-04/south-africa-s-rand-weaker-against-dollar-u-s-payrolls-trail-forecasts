The rand stayed weaker against the
dollar after a report showed U.S. payrolls rose less than
forecast last month, while the jobless rate unexpectedlly fell.    South Africa â€™s currency traded 0.3 percent weaker at 7.2949
as of 3:41 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Unemployment declined last month to 9 percent from 9.4
percent in December, the Labor Department said today in  Washington . Employment rose by 36,000 workers, the smallest gain
in four months, after a 121,000 rise in December that was larger
than initially reported. Payrolls were projected to climb
146,000, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
