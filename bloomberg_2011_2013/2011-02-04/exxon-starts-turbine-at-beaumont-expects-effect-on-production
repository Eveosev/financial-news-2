  Exxon Mobil Corp ., the largest U.S.
oil company, expects output to be affected as it starts a cogen
turbine at its Beaumont refinery in  Texas , said Kevin Allexon, a
company spokesman.  “We anticipate some impact to production,” Allexon, who
is based in Fairfax,  Virginia , said in an e-mail today. The
company reported in a message on a community hot line that
conditions required flaring.  Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed.  The plant can process 359,100 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
