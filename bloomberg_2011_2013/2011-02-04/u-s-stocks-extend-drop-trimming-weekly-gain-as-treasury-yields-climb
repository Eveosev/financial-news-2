U.S. stocks fell, trimming a weekly
advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as rising Treasury
yields spurred concern that higher  interest rates  will slow the
economic recovery.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,304.92 at 11:20 a.m. in New York to pare its weekly advance to
2.2 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 14.16 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 12,048.1. Thirty-year Treasury yields climbed
six basis points to 4.73 percent, the highest since April.  “Bottom line, higher rates do hurt stock prices,” said
Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading LLC
in Chatham, New Jersey. “Good economic news could potentially
now be bad for stocks because it could send interest rates up.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
