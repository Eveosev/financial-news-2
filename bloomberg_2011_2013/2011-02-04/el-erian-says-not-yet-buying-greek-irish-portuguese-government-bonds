Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., said he is “not
yet” buying Greek, Irish or Portuguese bonds as those indebted
European states tackle reform.   “We’re not yet buying Greek or Irish bonds or
Portuguese,” El-Erian told officials at the Munich Security
Conference. “I say ‘not yet’ because, as I say, we’re hoping
that efforts will continue” with issues such as liquidity, debt
overhang and competitiveness.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
