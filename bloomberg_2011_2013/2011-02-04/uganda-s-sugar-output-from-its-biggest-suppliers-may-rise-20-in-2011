Sugar production at Uganda’s three
biggest plants may rise 20 percent this year after expansions,
the  Uganda  Sugar Cane Technologists Association said.  Output may climb to 350,000 metric tons from 292,052 tons
last year, the association said in an e-mailed statement today.
Production will be sufficient to meet domestic demand and
provide a “significant” amount of exports, it said.  Supply at Kakira Sugar Works Ltd., the biggest producer and
owned by Madhvani Group, will rise 9.2 percent to 165,000 tons,
the agency said. Sugar Corp. of Uganda Ltd., the smallest, will
produce 7.1 percent more at 54,000 tons and Kinyara Sugar Works
Ltd. may produce 39 percent more at 126,000 tons. Kinyara is 51
percent-owned by Rai Group, a Kenyan and Mauritius-based agro-
forest company.  Uganda imported 45,988 tons and exported 7,919 tons of
sugar in 2009, according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
