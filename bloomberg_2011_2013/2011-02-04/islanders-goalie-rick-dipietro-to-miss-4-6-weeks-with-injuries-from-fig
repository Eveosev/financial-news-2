New York Islanders goalie Rick DiPietro will miss four to six weeks after breaking bones in his
face and injuring his knee in a fight this week, the team said
today in a news release.  DiPietro, who signed a 15-year, $67.5 million contract with
the National Hockey League team in 2006, was injured fighting
with Pittsburgh Penguins goalie Brent Johnson on Feb. 2.  Since being drafted first by the Islanders in 2000, the 29-
year-old DiPietro has battled injuries. He hasn’t played a full
season since 2007-08 and missed the second half of the 2008-09
season with pain in his surgically repaired left knee.  This season, DiPietro has played in 21 games, posting a
7-10-4 record with a 3.36 goals-against average and a .890 save
percentage. The Islanders are in last place in the NHL’s 15-team
Eastern Conference with a 16-28-7 record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
