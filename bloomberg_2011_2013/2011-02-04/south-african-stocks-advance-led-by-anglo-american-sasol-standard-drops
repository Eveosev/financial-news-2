South Africa’s FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index gained for a fourth day, climbing 107.68, or 0.3
percent, to 32,902.52 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. The
gauge has risen 4.3 percent this week, its biggest five-day
increase since July 2009.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.    Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the diversified mining company
that makes up 11 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock
index, rose to the highest level since September 2008, gaining
5.74 rand, or 1.5 percent, to 387.25 rand. Credit Suisse AG
recommended investors buy the stock and said lost output of
metallurgical coal because of floods in  Australia  may constrain
the steel industry and lead prices to spike as they did in 2004,
according to an e-mailed note dated today.    Reunert Ltd . (RLO SJ), a South African engineering and
electronics company, snapped two days of gains, dropping 67
cents, or 1 percent, to 64.33 rand. The company sold its 40
percent stake in Nokia Siemens Networks South Africa Ltd. for
793 million rand ($109.3 million). The sale of the shares
dilutes earnings by 2 percent in the 12 months through September
compared with a year ago, the company said.    Sasol Ltd . (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, advanced the most since July 2009, increasing
20.05 rand, or 5.6 percent, to 381 rand, the highest since
September 2008. Sasol said earnings per share probably increased
by 17 percent to 27 percent in its fiscal first half as the
company curbed costs, and oil and chemical prices rose.  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK SJ), Africa’s largest lender,
snapped two days of gains, declining 83 rand, or 0.8 percent, to
106.42 rand. The lender doesn’t want to exit Russia “as a
region,” Financial Director Simon Ridley said in an interview
today.  Standard Bank  will only comment on any sale of its 36.4
percent stake in  Russia ’s Troika Dialog if a deal happens, the
company said in an e-mailed statement.
