An  AMR Corp . American Airlines jet
almost collided with two U.S. Air Force planes after taking off
from New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport last
month, U.S. transportation safety investigators said.  The American  Boeing Co . 777-200 plane was about 80 miles
southeast of New York, en route to Sao Paulo, when it came
within a mile of two Air Force C-17s that were flying toward
McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, the National
Transportation Safety Board said today in an e-mailed statement.
The board, which investigates transportation accidents, said the
planes came within a mile of each other.  Air traffic controllers directing each plane received
electronic alerts about the potential collision and directed the
aircraft away, the board said. The American crew also responded
to a cockpit collision avoidance system alert during the Jan. 20
incident.  The safety board, under a U.S.  regulation  that took effect
last year, is notified every time airplanes’ traffic and
collision avoidance systems, or TCAS, are put into action,
Bridget Serchak, an NTSB spokeswoman, said.  “We are aware that the NTSB is investigating the matter,”
said  Andrea Huguely , a spokeswoman for American, based in  Fort
Worth , Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
