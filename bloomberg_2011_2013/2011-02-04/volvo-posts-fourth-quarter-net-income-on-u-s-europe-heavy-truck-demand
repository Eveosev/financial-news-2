  Volvo AB , the world’s second-largest
truckmaker, raised its 2011 forecast for heavy-truck deliveries
10 percent in  North America  and Europe as demand rebounds from
the recession.  Fourth-quarter net income totaled 3.23 billion kronor ($500
million) compared with a loss of 2 billion kronor a year
earlier, the Gothenburg, Sweden-based company said today in a
statement. Profit missed a prediction of 3.9 billion kronor,
according to the average of 13 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue rose 23 percent to 73.4 billion kronor.  Volvo now expects industry sales this year for Europe and
North America at 220,000 vehicles in each of those regions, up
from a previous prediction of 200,000 in each market. Volvo, the
maker of Mack trucks in the U.S. and Renault trucks in  Europe ,
said fourth-quarter profit was lower due to currency shifts,
production bottlenecks and costs for a profit-sharing program.  “They got hit by the same effects we’ve seen with other
industrial companies, such as higher raw material costs,
currency effects and lower production” due to supply shortages,
said Christer Fredriksson, an analyst with ABG Sundal Collier in  Stockholm , who recommends buying the shares. “Even if they have
temporary problems with the production, the underlying trends
look very good.”  Shares Gain  Volvo rose as much as 1.40 kronor, or 1.3 percent, to
108.40 kronor and was up 0.1 percent to 107.10 kronor as of 9:46
a.m. in Stockholm trading. The shares have fallen 9.6 percent
this year, valuing the truckmaker at 227.5 billion kronor.  The Swedish krona has appreciated 11 percent versus the
dollar since Sept. 1, according to Bloomberg data. Exchange-rate
shifts, including a devaluation in  Venezuela , hurt fourth-
quarter earnings by 700 million kronor, while valuation changes
on financial derivatives cost another 269 million kronor, the
company said. Volvo also took a 125 million-krona provision to
fund its profit-sharing program.  Volvo’s truck orders in the quarter surged 63 percent to
62,051 vehicles. European registrations of trucks heavier than
16 tons  rose  7.8 percent last year to 175,233 vehicles, the
region’s carmakers’ association said Jan. 26. North American
sales rose 21 percent to 153,246 heavy trucks, according to
market forecaster ACT Research Co.  “There are some bottlenecks in the system, and the ramp-up
is not going quite as smoothly,” said Morten Imsgard, an
analyst at Sydbank A/S in Aabenraa,  Denmark , with an
“overweight” rating on the stock.  ‘Enhance Productivity’  Chief Executive Leif Johansson plans to step down in mid-
2011, and the manufacturer has yet to name a successor. The
company returned to profit in the first quarter of 2010 after
five consecutive losses totaling 16.1 billion kronor, helped by
cost cuts and sales spurred by the economic recovery.  “On the back of an improved order book, our focus is on
trimming the industrial system to enhance productivity and
capital efficiency,” Johansson said in the statement.  Volvo is the second European truckmaker to report earnings.
Swedish rival  Scania AB  posted fourth-quarter earnings before
interest and taxes of 3.65 billion kronor on Feb. 2, missing
analyst estimates. Stuttgart, Germany-based  Daimler AG , the
world’s largest truckmaker, plans to publish figures on Feb. 16,
while Munich-based  MAN SE  is scheduled to report on March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
