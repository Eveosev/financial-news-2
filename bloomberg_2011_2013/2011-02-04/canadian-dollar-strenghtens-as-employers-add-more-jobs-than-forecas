Canada’s dollar rose versus its U.S.
counterpart after a report showed employment increased more than
four times what economists predicted, encouraging speculation
the  Bank of Canada  may resume raising  interest rates .  The loonie, as the currency is often referred to after the
bird on the C$1 coin, was the biggest gainer against the
greenback among the 16 most-traded currencies and rose against
all of its counterparts. The currency also advanced as oil, the
nation’s biggest export, climbed.  “It’s a blowout number,” said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director for foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Montreal’s BMO
Capital Markets unit in Toronto. “We’ve seen a very good knee-
jerk reaction in Canadian dollar strength.”  The Canadian dollar appreciated 0.5 percent to 98.60 cents
per  U.S. dollar  at 7:28 a.m. in Toronto, from 99.11 cents
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0142.   Employment rose by 69,200 and the  labor force  increased by
106,400, Statistics  Canada  said today in Ottawa. The jobless
rate rose to 7.8 percent from December’s 7.6 percent. Economists
forecast 7.6 percent unemployment and job growth of 15,000,
according to the median estimates of 25 and 26 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, respectively.  The report may boost expectations for a Bank of Canada rate
increase. The central bank has left its benchmark interest rate
at 1 percent since boosting it for a third consecutive meeting
in September. The bank said Jan. 18 that increases would be
“carefully” considered.  Regained Jobs  The report restores Canada’s status as having regained all
the jobs lost in the recession, after a Jan. 28 revision based
on updated census data reduced  Statistics Canada ’s estimate of
total employment.  The agency said on Jan. 28 that employment fell 2.5
percent, or 427,900, between October 2008 and July 2009, and
increased by 398,000 jobs between July 2009 and December 2010.  Canada will have a “challenge” with the labor market,
Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said Jan. 31. The Bank of Canada
said last month that there will be “slack” in the economy
until the end of 2012 and companies need to boost investment and
labor productivity.  Crude for March delivery added 0.4 percent to $90.97 a
barrel. Oil is Canada’s largest export.  To contact the reporter for this story:
