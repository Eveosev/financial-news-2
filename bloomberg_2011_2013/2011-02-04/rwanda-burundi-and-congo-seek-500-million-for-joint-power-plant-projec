Rwanda, Burundi and Democratic
Republic of Congo will meet with potential investors next month
to finance construction of $500 million power plant, said Gedeon
Nizeye, director of geology at Burundi’s Ministry of Energy and
Mines.  The meeting in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, will include
the  European Investment Bank , the  African Development Bank  and
the German government, Nizeye said yesterday in an interview in
the Ugandan capital, Kampala.  The three neighboring countries will be equal partners in
the construction of the 147 megawatt Ruzizi 111 hydropower
project along their common border and will share the energy
produced equally, he said.  “We have been united by the common problem of power
shortage,” Nizeye said.  Work may start on the project in 2013, with completion two
years later, Nizeye said.  Burundi, which produces 65 megawatts of power against
demand of 300 megawatts, has identified 10 sites for hydropower
projects that would lead to an energy surplus if developed, he
said. The extra power would help fuel targeted development in
the nickel industry.  “We are on a serious campaign to find investors for the
big potential in our power sector,” Nizeye said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
