The franc capped its first weekly
decline in four against the dollar as data showed the U.S.
unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, lessening demand for safe-
haven assets.  The Swiss currency also posted a weekly drop versus the
euro as the Stoxx Europe 600 Index of equities rose for a fourth
straight day. The franc depreciated versus all of its 16 most
actively traded peers this week.  Europe ’s services and
manufacturing industries expanded at the fastest pace in nine
months in January, data from Markit Economics showed yesterday,
adding to signs the global recovery is continuing.  “The franc’s been driven weaker as the general risk
environment has improved,” said Chris Walker, a foreign-
exchange strategist at UBS AG in  London . “There’s quite a
strong correlation with moves in equities.”  The franc weakened 1.2 percent against the dollar to 95.73
centimes as of 4:14 p.m. in London. It reached 95.94 centimes
earlier today, the weakest level since Jan. 24. The Swiss
currency depreciated 0.7 percent to 1.2976 per euro. It reached
1.3037 per euro yesterday, its weakest level since Jan. 24.  Data from the U.S. Labor Department showed unemployment
dropped to 9 percent last month from 9.4 percent in December.
Payrolls rose less than forecast, depressed by winter storms.  The franc has depreciated 3.2 percent this year against a
basket of nine developed-nation currencies, Bloomberg
correlation-weighted currency indexes show, amid waning concern
about Europe’s fiscal crisis. It has still appreciated 11
percent against the euro over the past 12 months.  The  Swiss National Bank  kept its benchmark interest rate
near zero on Dec. 16 and forecast economic growth to weaken to
1.5 percent this year, from around 2.5 percent in 2010. The
Swiss government estimates that export growth will slow to 2.6
percent this year from about 7 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
