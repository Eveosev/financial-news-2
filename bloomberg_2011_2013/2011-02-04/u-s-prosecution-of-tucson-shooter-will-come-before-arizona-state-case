U.S. and Arizona prosecutors say the
federal trial of Jared Lee Loughner, the man accused of shooting
U.S. Representative  Gabrielle Giffords  and of killing six
bystanders including a judge, will precede the state’s case.  “Loughner will first be prosecuted on federal charges by
the United States Attorney’s Office,” Arizona U.S. Attorney
Dennis Burke and Pima County Attorney Barbara LaWall said today
in an e-mailed joint statement.  Loughner, 22, last month pleaded not guilty to federal
charges he attempted to kill Giffords and two of her aides at a
Jan. 8 meeting outside a Tucson supermarket. U.S. District Judge
John Roll and five other people were killed and 13 were wounded
before bystanders wrestled the defendant to the ground.  Loughner hasn’t been indicted yet on previously filed
federal charges he murdered Roll and one of Giffords’s aides.
The congresswoman is recuperating from a gunshot wound to the
head at a Houston rehabilitation facility.  Loughner faces three U.S. criminal counts including
attempted assassination of a member of Congress, a statute that
requires the suspension of state jurisdiction over the shooting
“until federal action is terminated,” according to the
prosecutors’ joint statement.  The case is U.S. v. Loughner, 11-00187, U.S. District
Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix).  To contact the reporter on this story:
