The Democratic Republic of Congo’s
economy will probably expand 6.8 percent this year, while
inflation will average 9.9 percent, Budget Minister Jean-
Baptiste Ntahwa Kuderwa told reporters in the capital, Kinshasa,
today.  Kuderwa presented a 6.75 trillion franc ($7.28 billion)
budget for the year, a 20.1 percent increase over 2010. Congo’s
2011 gross domestic product will be about 13.7 trillion francs,
he said.  Mineral-rich Congo is benefitting from a rebound in
commodity prices after the 2008 global economic crisis, as well
as an 80 percent reduction in the country’s external debt stock
after qualifying for an  International Monetary Fund  and World
Bank debt relief program in July, Kuderwa said.  The 2011 budget will promote agricultural production
through industrialization and infrastructure improvements, he
said. It also allocates about $160 million to general elections
planned for November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
