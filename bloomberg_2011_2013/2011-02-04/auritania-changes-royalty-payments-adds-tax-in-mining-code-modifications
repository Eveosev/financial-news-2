Mauritania  changed its mining code to
modify the way the government calculates royalties and changed
the amount of land it gives under exploration deals.  Royalties, which were fixed, will now float based on
international prices, Industry and Mines Minister Mohamed Abdellahi Ould Oudaa told reporters in Nouakchott, the capital,
yesterday. A 10 percent tax on all mining transactions will be
levied as well, he said.  The amount of land given in exploration permits for most
minerals was narrowed to 500 square kilometers, from 1,000
square kilometers. Diamond concessions will remain at 5,000
square kilometers.  Royalty payments will be higher for companies that operate
in areas with good infrastructure and offer higher mineral
potential, Oudaa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
