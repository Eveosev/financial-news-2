Gold declined on speculation that an
economic recovery will curb demand for the metal as an
alternative investment.  The dollar gained against the euro after a Labor Department
report showed the U.S. jobless rate in January unexpectedly fell
to 9 percent, the lowest in 21 months. Earlier, gold reached a
two-week high of $1,361 an ounce as the mounting conflict in the
Middle East boosted demand for a haven.  “We’ve seen a slight improvement generally in the economic
recovery,” said Bernard Sin, the head of currency and metal
trading at MKS Finance SA, a bullion refiner in Geneva. “People
are still very concerned about the Middle East and will be
comfortable buying on any dips.”  Gold futures for April delivery fell $4, or 0.3 percent, to
settle at $1,349 an ounce at 1:15 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
This week, the price rose 0.5 percent.  An improving labor market “would present a downside risk
for metal prices” on the prospect that the  Federal Reserve 
would tighten monetary policy, Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF
Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago, said in a report.  Yesterday, gold held in exchange-traded products rose 0.87
metric ton to 2,028.9 tons, snapping an eight-session slide,
data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show. Holdings have
dropped 3.3 percent this year. They reached a record 2,114.6
tons in December.    Dennis Gartman , an economist and editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter, advised clients this week to buy
gold after the metal bounced off the 150-day moving average, the
fourth time that has happened in the past year. The price fell
to $1,309.10 on Jan. 28, near the key technical indicator.  “So long as gold remains above that now increasingly
important support level, we shall remain long and look to buy
more sooner rather than later,” Gartman said.  Silver futures for March delivery gained 33.1 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $29.059 an ounce. The metal rose 4.1 percent this
week.  Palladium futures for March delivery fell $4.10, or 0.5
percent, to $816.45 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Earlier, the price reached $834.50, the highest since
March 2001. The metal was little changed this week.  Platinum for April delivery advanced $1.70 to $1,845.80 an
ounce. The price rose 2.3 percent this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Nicholas Larkin  in  London  at
