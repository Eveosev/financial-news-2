  England  got two tries from Chris
Ashton and held on to defeat Wales 26-19 in Cardiff to start the
Six Nations rugby tournament.  The visitors built a 23-9 lead in the second half before
Wales got a try from Morgan Stoddart in the 60th minute to creep
back into the game. A James Hook penalty kick moved Wales to 23-
19. Jonny Wilkinson then restored England’s seven-point
advantage four minutes from the end, leaving Wales needing to
score a try that didn’t come.  “It was very physical: it was massive to get a good
start,”  Toby Flood , who scored 13 points, said in a televised
interview. “We had a couple mistakes but in the end we were right there.”  It was England’s first victory in Cardiff since 2003, when
it won the Six Nations. Mike Tindall won in his first match as
England captain.  Tomorrow,  Italy  hosts Ireland and Scotland visits France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
