Highland Capital Management LP, the
debt manager with about $22 billion in  assets  under management,
is selling its European loan funds, according to five people
familiar with the discussions.  Natixis is managing the transaction, said two of the
people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. Stefan Prelog, a spokesman for Dallas-based Highland,
declined to comment.  Highland raised four collateralized loan obligations rated
by Standard & Poorâ€™s in Europe and having an initial size of
about 2.46 billion euro ($3.35 billion), according to Gordon Wright, director of structured credit at the ratings company in  London .  The firm said it acquired ING Capital Management Ltd., a
CLO manager in Europe, from ING Wholesale Banking, according to
an April 5, 2005 news release. The acquired firm, ICML, was
renamed Highland Capital Management Europe Ltd., according to
the release.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  To contact the reporters on this story:
