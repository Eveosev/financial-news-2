  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA 
Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault said the company did not
expect to become a shareholder in  Hermes International  SCA and
that it did so because of “technical reasons.”  LVMH supports the management and founding family at Hermes,
who have a controlling stake in the Birkin bag maker, Arnault
said at a press conference in Paris today. He understands that
the family was “a bit surprised” by LVMH’s stakebuilding.  LVMH unveiled a stake in Hermes in October and now owns
20.2 percent of the maker of silk scarves and Kelly bags. The
company’s investment in Hermes is “friendly,” and
“peaceful,” according to Arnault. That doesn’t mean the
shareholding will be “passive,” he added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
