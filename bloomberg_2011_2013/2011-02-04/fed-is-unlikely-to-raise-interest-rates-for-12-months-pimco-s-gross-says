The  Federal Reserve  is unlikely to
raise  interest rates  for at least 12 months because the U.S.
economy isn’t generating enough growth to lower unemployment, 
Pacific Investment Management Co.’sBill Gross said.  The Fed would probably like to see the economy adding at
least 200,000 jobs a month before considering rate increases,
Gross said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with
Tom Keene.   The U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly fell in January to the
lowest level since April 2009, while payrolls rose less than
forecast, depressed by winter storms.  Unemployment declined to 9 percent last month from 9.4
percent in December, the Labor Department said today in  Washington . Employment rose by 36,000 workers, the smallest
gain in four months, after a 121,000 rise in December that
was larger than initially reported. Payrolls were projected to
climb 146,000, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
