  Sony Corp . rose the most in more than
a week in Tokyo trading after Japan’s largest exporter of
electronics reported third-quarter profit that exceeded analyst
estimates.  The stock climbed 1.8 percent to close at 2,919 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest gain since Jan. 25. The Nikkei
225 Stock Average advanced 1.1 percent.  The company yesterday reported net income of 72.3 billion
yen ($886 million) in the quarter ended Dec. 31, beating the
65.9 billion yen average of six analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sony’s product group that makes PlayStation games reported
profit more than doubled to 45.7 billion yen, helped by cost
reductions to make the PS3 console and increased sales of game
titles. That cushioned a slump in TV prices, which eroded
earnings at Samsung Electronics Co. and Panasonic Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
