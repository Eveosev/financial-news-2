Copper extended a rally to a record
on mounting concern that the global economic recovery will boost
consumption of the metal used in cars, homes and appliances
while mining companies struggle to increase output.  Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., the world’s largest
publicly traded producer, said the market will be “tight in
2011, and for the foreseeable future.” The metal has more than
tripled since the end of 2008 on rising demand from  China , the
world’s largest buyer. In the U.S., the second-biggest user,
unemployment fell in January to the lowest level since April
2009, the Labor Department said today.  “Demand for copper continues to be robust and growing,”
said James Dailey, who manages $185 million at TEAM Financial
Asset Management LLC in Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania . “Bringing
copper production online is very costly and protracted, so it
may be some time before production levels are able to grow fast
enough to offset the growth in demand.”  Copper futures for March delivery rose 3.5 cents, or 0.8
percent, to close at $4.5795 a pound at 1:26 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York . Earlier, the price reached a record $4.614. The
metal is up 4.7 percent this week, the biggest weekly gain since
Dec. 3.  The global supply deficit will reach 822,000 metric tons in
2011, more than double last year’s shortfall,  Barclays Capital 
said on Jan. 20. JPMorgan Securities Ltd. and Macquarie Bank
Ltd. also predicted a deficit, and Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. and Morgan Stanley have boosted their price
forecasts.  China Demand  “We have continuing strong demand out of China and the
prospects of continued recovery in the U.S. and in parts of  Europe ,” Kathleen Quirk, Freeport’s chief financial officer,
said yesterday in a telephone interview from Phoenix. “That is
also overlaid on a situation where supply is very limited. Our
industry hasn’t been able to expand capacity fast enough to meet
the demand.”  Copper for three-month delivery added $120, or 1.2 percent,
to $10,050 a ton ($4.56 a pound) on the  London  Metal Exchange.
Earlier, the metal climbed to $10,100, the highest ever.  Also in London, tin climbed 2.1 percent to $31,200 a ton
after reaching a record $31,300. Prices are up 16 percent this
year. PT Timah, the biggest supplier of the metal, said on Jan.
14 its production may drop for a fourth straight year in 2011.  Aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
