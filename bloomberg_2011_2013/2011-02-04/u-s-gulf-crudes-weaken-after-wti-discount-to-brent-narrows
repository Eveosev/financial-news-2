The premiums for U.S. Gulf crudes
weakened compared with West  Texas  Intermediate as the U.S.
benchmark’s discount to its European counterpart narrowed.  The spread between March-delivery futures for WTI and
Brent, the basis for European and West African crudes, narrowed
to $10.85 a barrel at 12:40 p.m. in  New York . A narrower premium
for Brent makes imports to the Gulf Coast less expensive
compared with U.S. grades.  Mars Blend’s premium weakened 25 cents to $6.55 a barrel at
12:09 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Poseidon’s premium narrowed 30 cents to $6.50. Southern Green
Canyon’s premium fell 50 cents to $5.25.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened 20 cents to
$11.75 a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 35
cents to $12.60.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI weakened 55 cents to $10.25.
West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 20 cents to $4.95. WTS is
delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less influenced by
imports.  Syncrude’s premium to WTI was unchanged at $4.50 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta. The discount for Western Canada Select
widened 25 cents to $25.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
