Oil pared gains in  New York  after a
report showed employment in the U.S. rose less than analysts
forecast last month.  The March contract on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  was
at $91.04, up 50 cents, at 1:44 p.m. London time after rising to
$91.35. Brent crude for March settlement was up 19 cents at
$101.95 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  Nonfarm payrolls in the U.S. rose by 36,000 workers in
January, the smallest gain in four months, the Labor Department
said today. A survey of economists expected the number to rise
by 146,000 workers.  “The lower-than-expected jobs figure has put pressure on
the oil contracts,” said Glen Ward, head of retail derivatives
at  London  Capital Group Holdings Plc. “This has been
interpreted as bearish for demand as the economy is not growing
as anticipated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
