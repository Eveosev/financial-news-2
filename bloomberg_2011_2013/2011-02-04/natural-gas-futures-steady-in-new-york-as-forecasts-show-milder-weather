Natural gas futures declined for a
second day as forecasts showed milder weather later this month,
reducing demand for the heating fuel.  Gas dropped 0.6 percent as companies including MDA Federal
Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in Rockville,  Maryland , predicted
temperatures will be higher than usual in the eastern U.S. from
Feb. 14 to Feb. 18. U.S. stockpiles were 0.2 percent above the
five-year average last week, the Energy Department said
yesterday.  “If the weather becomes warmer, it would be a game-
changer,” said  Peter Beutel , president of trading advisory
company Cameron Hanover Inc. in  New Canaan ,  Connecticut . “That
means that we would see the weather stop cutting into
supplies.”  Natural gas for March delivery fell 2.7 cents to settle at
$4.31 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have dropped 20 percent from a
year ago and slipped 0.3 percent this week.  There will be “rapid temperature moderation” in the
eastern U.S. in mid-February, according to Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  New York will have a high of 53 degrees Fahrenheit (12
Celsius) on Feb. 15, 12 degrees above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. Boston will
have a high of 52 degrees, 13 degrees above normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas Stockpiles  Natural-gas shortages are being reported across the U.S.
Southwest today as unusually cold weather caused demand to rise
and power outages disrupted transmission and production.  New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez declared a state of
emergency due to gas shortages.  El Paso Corp ., owner of a  gas
pipeline  in the state, said that demand is unusually high due to
cold weather. Additionally, blackouts in  Texas  shut down
processing plants and well freeze-offs slowed supply.  U.S. gas inventories fell 189 billion cubic feet in the
week ended Jan. 28 to 2.353 trillion, the Energy Department
said. The surplus to the five-year average narrowed from 1.2
percent the previous week.  Gas rose in earlier trading after the Labor Department
reported that U.S. factory payrolls increased by 49,000 in
January, the most since August 1998, while the jobless rate
unexpectedly dropped to 9 percent.  Factory Fuel  Industrial demand for gas will rise 1.1 percent to 18.15
billion cubic feet a day this year from 2010’s 17.95 billion,
the Energy Department forecast in its  monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook  on Jan. 11. Factories, chemical plants and other
industrial users account for 28 percent of gas consumption.  The department will release this month’s outlook on Feb. 8.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
238,717 as of 2:51 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 292,000. Volume was 295,834 yesterday. Open interest was
844,025 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
794,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
