  Hitachi Ltd ., Japan’s third-largest
company by revenue, climbed to a two-year high in Tokyo trading
after the company raised its full-year profit forecast 15
percent.  The shares advanced 3 percent to close at 487 yen, the
highest since November 2008, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
benchmark  Nikkei 225  Stock Average climbed 1.1 percent. Hitachi
has risen 12 percent this year.  Hitachi, a maker of nuclear power plants, construction
machinery, factory equipment and appliances, may post net income
of 230 billion yen ($2.8 billion) in the year ending March 31,
the Tokyo-based company said in a statement yesterday after the
market closed. That exceeded Hitachi’s 200 billion yen
projection in November and the 206 billion yen average of 19
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Hitachi is forecasting its first annual profit in five
years as it eliminates money-losing units and focuses on
profitable operations including industrial machinery and
infrastructure such as  power plants . The company kept its full-
year sales forecast unchanged at 9.3 trillion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
