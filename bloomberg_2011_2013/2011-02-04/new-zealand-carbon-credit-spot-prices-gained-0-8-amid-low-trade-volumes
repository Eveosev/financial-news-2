The spot price of emission credits in  New Zealand ’s carbon market gained 0.8 percent last week on low
trade volumes, Auckland-based broker OMFinancial Ltd. said.  Spot carbon credits traded at NZ$19.45 ($15.04) a metric
ton compared with NZ$19.30 a week earlier, the broker said in an
e-mailed statement today. Companies in New Zealand that emit  greenhouse gases  have the option to pay a tax of NZ$25 a ton of
emissions or buy the contracts.  “Emitters are not keen to chase the market as there is not
any meaningful volume on offer,” the e-mail said. The low price
is also delaying selling decisions as prices reached as high as
NZ$21 in December, according to the broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
