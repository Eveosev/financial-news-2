  Exxon Mobil Corp . shut two processing
units at Fawley, the U.K.’s largest refinery, for about six
weeks of planned maintenance from today.  “The refinery will shut down one of its pipestills
(primary distillation units) and one of the powerformers,” the
company said in a  statement  on its website today. “The work is
expected to continue throughout February and on to mid-March.”  The refinery can process about 320,000 barrels of crude oil
a day and supplies 15 percent of Britain’s petroleum products,
according to the country’s Petroleum Industry Association.
Refiners regularly halt equipment for inspections and repairs to
prevent problems and ensure efficient operations.  Powerformers make blending components for gasoline. Exxon
Mobil is based in Irving,  Texas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
