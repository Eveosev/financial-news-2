  BNP Paribas , France’s largest bank,
met with South Africa’s banking regulator to exchange
information about operating in Africa’s largest economy, the
regulator said.  BNP “paid a courtesy visit to have a conversation about
normal international banking information,” Errol Kruger, the
Pretoria-based Registrar of Banks, said in a telephone interview
yesterday. Yesterday’s meeting lasted an hour and BNP may be in
touch with the central bank again, he said, adding that the
lender hasn’t applied for a banking license in South Africa.  With growth in Africa forecast to outstrip that of
developed nations, financial institutions like Citigroup Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Barclays Plc  have increased their focus
on the continent. BNP has a representative office in South
Africa.  To obtain a banking license in South Africa, a bank needs
to provide capital of up to 250 million rand ($34.3 million) or
10 percent of its risk-weighted assets, whichever figure was
higher, Kruger said. Banks, including  Standard Chartered Plc ,  HSBC Holdings Plc  and Japanese lenders, visit the regulator
“all the time,” he said.  Gillian Gamsy International Communications , a Johannesburg-
based public relations company, is “working on a proposal for
BNP,” Tamun Pillay, who works for the South African
communications company, said in an e-mailed response to
questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
