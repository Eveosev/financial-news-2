  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA ,
the world’s largest maker of  luxury goods , fell in Paris trading
after 2010 operating profit failed to beat analysts’ estimates.  Profit from recurring operations rose 29 percent to 4.32
billion euros ($5.9 billion), LVMH said today. Analysts had
anticipated earnings on that basis of 4.33 billion euros,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Annual sales
climbed 19 percent to 20.3 billion euros.  “A sales and earnings release ‘just in line,’ is likely to
be insufficient to push the share today,” Pierre Lamelin, an
analyst at CA Cheuvreux, wrote in an e-mail. “We are not
worried, given the emerging markets exposure and the strong
pricing power.”  Revenue was driven by gains at the Louis Vuitton brand,
which raised prices and introduced new products such as Monogram
Empreinte leather accessories. Luxury-goods makers including  Hermes International  SCA, in which LVMH owns 20.2 percent,
reported double-digit sales growth in 2010 as wealthy consumers
regained confidence and retailers replenished inventories.
Luxury demand may rise 11 percent in 2011, according to HSBC.  The outlook for 2011 is “excellent,” LVMH said. Full-year
net income rose 73 percent to 3.03 billion euros, beating
analysts’ estimates. Excluding transactions related to Hermes,
2010 profit was 2.29 billion euros, LVMH said at a presentation.  ‘Solid Result’  “A solid result, although marginally below our estimates
at the operating profit line,” said Rey Wium, an analyst at
Renaissance BJM, who forecast operating profit of 4.51 billion
euros. “We anticipate another solid year, with some slowdown in
the rate of growth.”  The shares fell as much as 3.95 euros, or 3.4 percent, to
112.95 euros and traded at 114.05 euros as of 9:20 a.m. in
Paris. The stock, which advanced 57 percent last year, has
dropped 7.5 percent in 2011, giving it a market value of 55.8
billion euros.  Last year was an “outstanding year,” Chief Executive
Officer  Bernard Arnault  said today at a press conference.  LVMH
is well-equipped to continue its growth momentum across all
business groups in 2011 and will focus on developing its brands
through innovation, quality and expansion in high potential
markets, the company said in the statement.  LVMH will propose a dividend increase of 27 percent to 2.10
euros a share at a shareholders meeting on March 31. An interim
dividend of 70 euro cents a share was paid on Dec. 2 last year.
The balance of 1.40 euros will be paid on May 25, LVMH said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
