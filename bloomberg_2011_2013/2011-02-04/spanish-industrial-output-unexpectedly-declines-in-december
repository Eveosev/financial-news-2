Spanish industrial production
unexpectedly declined in December as government austerity
measures weighed on demand.  Output at factories, refineries and mines fell 0.1 percent
from a year earlier, adjusting for the number of working days,
after expanding a revised 2.7 percent in November, the National
Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said today in an e-mailed
statement. Economists expected production to rise 1.5 percent
according to the median of six forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  The Spanish government forecasts economic growth of 1.3
percent this year even as it implements the deepest budget cuts
in at least three decades. Unemployment remains the highest in  Europe , at 20.2 percent in December, according to the European
Unionâ€™s statistics office.  The statistics institute originally reported an increase of
2.3 percent in annual production in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
