Corn surged to the highest since July
2008 on speculation that demand from  China  will surge to a
record, further eroding global stockpiles. Soybeans fell.  China’s corn imports may reach 9 million metric tons in
2011, the U.S. Grains Council said yesterday. That would be more
than double the previous record of 4.3 million tons set in 1995.
Demand is soaring after the government sold grain from state
warehouses to curb food prices. World inventories may tumble to
50 days of estimated use, the second-lowest since 1976,
Department of Agriculture data show.  “China’s stated goal is to rebuild strategic inventories,
and that means they will need to buy soon” to get deliveries
before harvesting begins in September, said Lewis Hagedorn, a
soft-commodity strategist for JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  New York .
“There is more Chinese buying yet to come.”  Corn futures for March delivery gained 16 cents, or 2.4
percent, to close at $6.785 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, pushing this week’s gain to 5.4 percent, the
most in three weeks.  Earlier, the price touched $6.795, the highest since July
17, 2008. The grain has surged 92 percent in the past year.  Drought last year slashed crops in  Russia , Ukraine and
other parts of  Europe , and adverse weather reduced harvests in
the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia , increasing demand for U.S.
grain.  Surging Exports  U.S. exporters sold 1.167 million tons in the week ended
Jan. 27, the largest weekly total since the marketing year began
Sept. 1, the Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Soybean
sales for delivery in the year ending Aug. 31 jumped 32 percent
to 1.032 million tons from a week earlier, and sales for
delivery in the following year were 3.076 million tons.  “Corn demand continues to show few signs that high prices
are slowing overseas demand,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.
“Soybean exports are outstanding, but may begin to slow with
harvesting just beginning in Brazil and Argentina,” the two
biggest shippers after the U.S., Schultz said.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $14.335 a bushel. Still, prices added 2.5 percent
this week, the first gain in three weeks.  Yesterday, the price reached $14.525, the highest for a
most-active contract since July 18, 2008.  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
