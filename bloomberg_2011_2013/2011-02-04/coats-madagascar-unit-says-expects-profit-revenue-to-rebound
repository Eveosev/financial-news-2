Coats Plc’s Madagascar unit expects
to return to profit this year and revenue to recover in 2012
when U.S. trade concessions are restored, said Salim Mugon, the
company’s director in the country.  Annual turnover at Coats Madagascar, the Indian Ocean
island nation’s biggest sewing thread maker, fell by 50 percent
to $1.6 million last year, Mugon said today in an interview in
Antananarivo, the capital.  The U.S. suspended Madagascar from its Africa Growth &
Opportunity Act, which allows African states to export goods to
the U.S. duty-free, after Andry Rajoelina ousted  Marc
Ravalomanana  as president with the help of the military in 2009.
The European Union also suspended the country from its trade
agreement and foreign donors stopped sending aid. The country is
scheduled to hold elections this year.  “We don’t hold out hope for AGOA returning in 2011 but we
do for 2012,” Mugon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
