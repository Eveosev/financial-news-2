Sugar gained in  New York  on
speculation that yesterday’s slump, the biggest in a month, was
overdone given robust demand and tight global supplies. Cocoa
and coffee fell.  Sugar tumbled 9.3 percent yesterday as automatic sales by
computer programs exaggerated a slide that started after
concerns eased that Cyclone Yasi would damage crops in
Australia. Prices have more than doubled since the end of May
as adverse global weather slashed crops.  “We have strong demand, production losses and low
supplies,” said Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity
Trading Corp., a commodities brokerage in Medford,  Oregon . “We
still have to wait and see what the damage was in Australia.”  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.6 cent, or 1.9
percent, to settle at 32.64 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York.  Sugar-cane plantations may lose 50 percent of production
potential after Yasi hit a region that accounts for a third of
national output, according to a growers group.  Australia  is the
third-largest exporter. The price dropped 3.8 percent this
week, largely on yesterday’s decline.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery
dropped $19.80, or 2.4 percent, to $794.40 a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe. The price fell 2.5 percent for the week.  Cocoa futures for March delivery declined $99, or 2.9
percent, to settle at $3,264 a ton at 12:03 p.m. on ICE, the
biggest drop since Jan. 4. The price fell 0.4 percent this
week.  In London, cocoa futures for March delivery dropped 52
pounds, or 2.4 percent, to 2,139 pounds ($3,441) a ton on NYSE
Liffe. It was the biggest decline since Jan. 4. The price slid
1.2 percent this week.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery fell 2.05 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $2.493 a pound on ICE, paring this week’s
gain to 1.8 percent.  In  London , robusta-coffee futures for March delivery slid
$32, or 1.4 percent, to $2,207 a ton on NYSE Liffe, gaining 3.7
