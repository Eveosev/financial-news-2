  Suzlon Energy Ltd ., India’s biggest
maker of  wind turbines , reported its fourth-straight quarterly
loss, missing analyst estimates as a weaker euro devalued its
overseas assets.  The third-quarter loss of 2.54 billion rupees ($55.7
million) in the three months ended Dec. 31 worsened from a
profit of 141 million rupees a year earlier, according to a
company statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange. The results were
double the 1.26 billion-rupee mean loss estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  A weaker euro devalued Suzlon Energy’s overseas assets by
1.72 billion rupees, Chief Financial Officer Robin Banerjee said
today in a telephone interview.  “If you add that back, the loss is very marginal,”
Banerjee said. “We’re almost there to the black number that
we’re looking for.” He declined to forecast whether the
Ahmedabad-based company could return to profit by next quarter.  Suzlon, which refinanced 100 billion rupees in loans last
year, is seeking to ramp up orders before a grace period on loan
principal repayments ends in April 2012. Its competitors include
Enercon India, a unit of Germany’s Enercon GmbH.  Suzlon owns stakes in the Belgium-based gearbox maker  Hansen Transmissions International NV  and  Repower Systems AG , a
German wind-turbine maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
