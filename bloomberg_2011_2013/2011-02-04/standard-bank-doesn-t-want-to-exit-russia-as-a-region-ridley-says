  Standard Bank  Group Ltd. said it
doesn’t want to exit Russia “as a region” after  Business Day 
reported that  Africa ’s biggest bank may sell its stake in
Moscow-based brokerage Troika Dialog.  “Long term, our interest in the region is still strong,”
Simon Ridley, chief financial officer of the Johannesburg-based
bank, said today in an interview. While we want to stay in
Russia, “we are a minority shareholder in Troika,” he said.  Standard Bank may sell its Troika stake for $360 million,
 Business Day  said, citing  Renaissance Capital  and unidentified
Russian media reports. Troika Chairman Ruben Vardanian said on
Feb. 2 that a tie-up with Russian state-run lender OAO Sberbank
“would make sense” for the country’s oldest investment bank.  Standard Bank paid $300 million in 2009 for its 36.4
percent stake in Troika, the lender said today in a statement.  “There have been numerous media reports regarding talks
between the management of Troika Dialog, who own 63.6 percent of
the company, and Sberbank, the largest bank in  Russia , regarding
a possible combination of their respective investment and
commercial banking platforms,” the statement said. Standard
Bank “will only comment further if and when any potential
transaction materializes,” it said.  Standard Bank fell 1.2 percent to 105.97 rand as of 11:49
a.m. in Johannesburg trading, valuing the lender at 168 billion
rand ($23 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
