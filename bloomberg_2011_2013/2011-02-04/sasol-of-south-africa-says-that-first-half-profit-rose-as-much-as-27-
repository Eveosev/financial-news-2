  Sasol Ltd ., the largest producer of
motor fuels made from coal, said earnings per share probably
increased by 17 percent to 27 percent in its fiscal first half
as the company curbed costs, and oil and chemical prices rose.  Gains were eroded by the strength of  South Africa ’s rand,
while the sale of a stake in a mining unit to black investors
cut earnings by 1 rand a share, Sasol said in statement today.  Average oil prices in the first half through December rose
12 percent in  New York  from a year earlier, while gaining only
3.9 percent in rand terms because of the jump in the currency.
Sasol posted net income of 6.3 billion rand ($864 million), or
11.14 rand a share, in the previous fiscal first half ended
December 2009. Results for last year are scheduled for March 7.  Sasol rose 3.09 rand, or 0.9 percent, to 364.04 rand by
10:08 a.m. in Johannesburg trading, valuing the company at 233.6
billion rand. Five of the 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
recommended buying the stock and one rated it “overweight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
