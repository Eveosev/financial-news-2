Sudanese  government troops clashed
with units made up of soldiers from the south in the city of
Malakal in Upper Nile state, killing at least six people and
wounding 22, a state government spokesman said.  The fighting started last night when southern soldiers in
the Sudanese government army refused orders to move to northern
Sudan out of fear they would be disarmed, Bartholomew Pakwan
Abwol, the state director general of information, said today by
phone from Malakal. Upper Nile is one of 10 states in Southern  Sudan .  “No one has gone to the scene of the fighting,” he said.
“Everyone is very scared. The situation is still very tense.”
At least four civilians, including two children, and two
soldiers were killed in the clashes, which ended at 11:30 a.m.
local time, Abwol said.  Oil-rich Southern Sudan voted last month to secede from
Sudan in a referendum, according to preliminary results
published by the commission that organized the vote.  Southern
Sudan  is set to become independent in July.  “We don’t have any business with these quarrels,” Philip
Aguer, a spokesman for Southern Sudan’s army, said today by
phone from Juba, the regional capital.  The referendum was the centerpiece of a 2005  peace accord 
that ended a civil war which lasted almost 50 years, except for
a cease-fire from 1972 to 1983, between the Muslim north and the
south, where Christianity and traditional religions dominate.
About 2 million people died in the second phase of the conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
