The U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly
fell in January to the lowest level in 21 months, while payroll
growth was depressed by winter storms.  Unemployment declined to 9 percent from December’s 9.4
percent, the Labor Department said today in  Washington .
Employers added 36,000 workers, short of the 146,000 median gain
projected by economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The dollar gained and Treasuries slid as the drop in
unemployment pointed to a labor market that’s on the mend
following the loss of almost 9 million jobs during the
recession. The improvement may not be enough to satisfy Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, who’s likely to keep  interest
rates  near zero for another year, said  Bill Gross , co-chief
investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co.  “We’ve got at least 12 months ahead of us before the Fed
feels comfortable in terms of a sustained period of  job
creation ,” Gross, who manages the world’s biggest bond fund,
said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom
Keene . “I would suspect that the Fed would believe that a more
normal unemployment rate would certainly be something less than
8 percent.”  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 3.64
percent at 4:20 p.m. in  New York  from 3.55 percent late
yesterday. The dollar strengthened to $1.3587 per euro from
$1.3634. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to
1,310.87 at the 4 p.m. close.  Construction, Transportation  Payrolls in construction and transportation, industries
most affected by bad weather, declined in January, while factory
employment rose the most since August 1998.  “Snow suppressed payrolls, but look past it and the labor
market is clearly improving,” said  Ward McCarthy , chief
financial economist at Jefferies & Co. in New York.  Companies including  Emerson Electric Co . are hiring as  consumer spending , business investment and exports climb,
signaling the expansion is gaining momentum.  Emerson, the maker of data-center equipment and
thermostats, plans to boost global employment this year by about
7,000 workers to meet rising sales.  “We are planning a very strong 2011,” Chief Executive
Officer David Farr said on a Feb. 1 conference call with
investors. “There’s definitely a point in time that we’re going
to have to start bringing people in.”  Private Hiring  Private hiring, which excludes government agencies, rose
50,000 in January. Factory payrolls increased by 49,000,
exceeding the survey forecast of a 10,000 gain.  President  Barack Obama  is stressing job-creating public
investments in education, technology and infrastructure as he
prepares to send a budget to Congress. He’s being hemmed by a
budget deficit that’s forecast to widen to a record $1.5
trillion.  “We’ve got to do more to keep getting the  unemployment
rate  down and to keep getting people back to work,” White House
chief economist  Austan Goolsbee  said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television.  The jobless rate, which was projected to rise to 9.5
percent, declined as the number of unemployed fell by 590,000.
Those people who said they were not in the  labor force  increased
by 162,000 in January, according to the Labor Department’s
survey of households. The drop from November’s 9.8 percent
marked the biggest two-month decline since 1958.  December’s gain in payrolls was revised to 121,000 from a
103,000 increase reported earlier, while November’s rise was
revised to 93,000 from 71,000.  Hourly Earnings  Average hourly earnings increased to $22.86 from $22.78 in
the prior month. The average work week for all workers slipped
to 34.2 hours from 34.3 hours.  Employment at service providers rose 18,000. Construction
payrolls dropped 32,000 and transportation and warehousing jobs
fell by 38,000. Retailers added 27,500 jobs.  A storm that spread from the Midwest and the South to  New
England  during the week covered by the Labor Department’s
employer survey likely depressed January numbers as businesses
temporarily closed.  Bad weather prevented 886,000 Americans from going to work
in the January survey week, the Labor Department’s survey of
households showed. That compares with an average of 282,000 over
the previous five Januarys. Economists at Morgan Stanley said
the storms may have subtracted about 150,000 workers from the
payrolls count, they said in a note to clients.  Government Payrolls  Government payrolls decreased by 14,000. State and local
governments struggling to close budget deficits reduced
employment by 12,000, while the federal government trimmed 2,000
workers.  The so-called underemployment rate -- which includes part-
time workers who’d prefer a full-time position and people who
want work but have given up looking -- decreased to 16.1 percent
from 16.7 percent. The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks
or more decreased as a percentage of all jobless, to 43.8
percent from 44.3 percent.  Revised figures showed the economy lost 8.75 million jobs
as a result of the recession. For all of 2010, the U.S. added
about 909,000 jobs. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg in January
projected unemployment will average more than 9 percent this
year.  “Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation,
we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established,” Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday in a speech at the  National Press Club  in Washington. “It will be several years
before the unemployment rate has returned to a more normal
level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
