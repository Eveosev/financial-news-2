  China ’s energy-intensive industries
cut consumption per unit of gross domestic product by more than
20 percent from 2006 to 2010, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported.  Industries including oil processing, coking, nuclear-fuel
processing, chemical manufacturing, smelting and electricity
production saved a total of 400 million metric tons of standard
coal, contributing more than 60 percent of the nation’s energy
savings, Xinhua said, citing the National Bureau of Statistics.  The industries account for 77 percent of China’s industrial
energy consumption and more than half the country’s total energy
consumption, Xinhua said.  An official from China’s National Development and Reform
Commission in December said China will meet its target of
cutting energy use per unit of GDP by 20 percent from 2006 to
the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Paul Gordon  in  Hong Kong  at
