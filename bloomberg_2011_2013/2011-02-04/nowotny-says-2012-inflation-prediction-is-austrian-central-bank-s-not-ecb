European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said that comments made to Der
Standard newspaper predicting inflation of 1.8% for 2012
doesnâ€™t reflect ECB forecasts.  The prediction is an internal one of the Austrian central
bank, which Nowotny heads, according to an e-mailed statement
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
