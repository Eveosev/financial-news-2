  India ’s 11-year bonds fell,
completing a weekly drop, on speculation quickening inflation
will prompt the central bank to raise  interest rates  for the
eighth time in a year.  An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products rose 17.05 percent in the week ended Jan. 22, the
biggest increase in a month, the commerce ministry said
yesterday. Higher oil prices added to inflationary pressure with
crude trading above $90 a barrel and headed for a second weekly
gain. India imports about 70 percent of the oil it uses.  “Accelerating food inflation is not giving any comfort to
investors,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “The rise in crude prices is
also a concern.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022,
India’s most-traded bond, climbed eight basis points this week
to 8.24 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to
the central bank’s trading system. The price fell 0.61, or 61
paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 99.19. The yield was four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, higher on the day.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said today India needs to
urgently contain prices that are rising at the fastest pace
among major economies in  Asia .  “Inflation is something, which needs to be tackled with
great urgency,” Singh said, addressing a meeting of government
officials in  New Delhi . The Indian economy “has been on a high
growth trajectory, but inflation poses a serious threat to the
growth momentum.”  The central bank sold 100 billion rupees of bonds due in
2015, 2022 and 2040 today.  The repurchase auction rate, at which lenders borrow
overnight from the central bank, is at 6.5 percent following a
quarter of a percentage point increase in January.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
advanced this week. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive
floating rates, rose 12 basis points to 7.47 percent. That’s six
basis points higher than yesterday’s closing level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
