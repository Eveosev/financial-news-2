Botswana Finance Minister Kenneth Matambo will probably forecast a narrow fiscal deficit for
2011-12 when he announces his budget on Feb. 7, as the economy
recovers from the global financial crisis.  The gap may shrink to 8 percent of gross domestic product
in the fiscal year through March 2012, Keith Jefferis, managing
director of Gaborone-based advisory company Econsult, said by
phone today. Matambo estimated the 2010-11 deficit at 12 billion
pula ($1.76 billion), or about 12 percent of GDP.  “Reducing the  budget deficit  and achieving fiscal
sustainability is an important objective, but in the short term,
expenditure restraint may have a negative effective on the
domestic economy,” Jefferis said.  The budget deficit in the southern African country, which
accounts for about a fifth of global diamond output, widened to
about 15 percent of GDP when the global economic crisis led to
lower demand for its mining exports. Some mines were forced to
close, leading to an economic contraction of 6 percent in 2009,
according to the central bank. Diamonds make up about half of
state revenue.  Growth has rebounded, with the economy expanding 11.3
percent in the third quarter of 2010 compared with a year
earlier on a 26 percent increase in mining output, the central
statistics agency said on Dec. 23.  The government is aiming to balance its budget by the
2012-13 fiscal year, Matambo said on Oct. 28  To contact the reporter on this story:
