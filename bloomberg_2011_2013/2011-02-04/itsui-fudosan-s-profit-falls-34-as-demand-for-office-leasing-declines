Mitsui Fudosan Co., Japan’s largest
property developer by sales, said net income fell 34 percent as
demand for its office leasing business decline.  Net income dropped to 33.8 billion yen ($414 million) for
the nine months ended Dec. 31 from 50.9 billion yen a year ago,
the Tokyo-based company said in a statement to the stock
exchange today. Sales declined 1.8 percent to 987.4 billion yen.  Mitsui Fudosan is heading for a third straight year of
profit declines on the back of flagging demand for offices as
companies cut spending. The vacancy rate for its office
buildings has almost doubled since March 2009, according to the
firm, while Tokyo office rent is at a six-year low, according to
Miki Shoji Co., a privately held office brokerage company.  The developer’s earnings contrast with smaller rival
Mitsubishi Estate Co., which today reported nine-month profit
climbed 27 percent to 44.4 billion yen as income from its
leasing business increased.  For the full year, Mitsui Fudosan reiterated its net income
forecast of 50 billion yen on revenue of 1.44 trillion yen.  Mitsui Fudosan’s shares fell 0.1 percent to 1,699 yen at
the 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, bringing its year-
to-date gain to 4.9 percent. The earnings results were released
after the close of trading.  Operating profit for the company’s leasing business, which
accounts for more than half of net income, dropped 4.2 percent
for the nine months ended Dec. 31.  Higher Vacancies  The vacancy rate in the division’s office space rose to 4.9
percent as of December from 3.2 percent in September, the
company said. The rate was 2.5 percent as of March 2009.  Operating profit at Mitsui Fudosan’s property sales
business for condominiums, houses and office buildings fell 64
percent in the nine months, today’s report showed.  Average office rents in Tokyo dropped to 17,585 yen per
tsubo in December, the lowest in six years, as the vacancy rate
started to decline from a record high in August, according to
Miki Shoji. One tsubo, a standard measure of property area in
Japan, is 3.3 square meters, or 35.5 square feet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
