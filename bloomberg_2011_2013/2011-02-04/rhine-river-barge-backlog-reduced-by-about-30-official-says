The backlog of barges on the Rhine
River upstream of an accident last month has been reduced by
about 30 percent in the last three days, a local official said.  About 300 barges are still backed up at St. Goar, south of
Koblenz, said Tobias Schmidt, a spokesman from an incident room
set up after the Jan. 13 accident, when a vessel sank. That
compares with about 450 vessels after the event.    Europe ’s busiest inland waterway, used for products from
gasoline to grain, was forced to close for about a week after
the vessel chartered by BASF SE sank. The stretch of river is
now open to upstream and downstream traffic during the day and
only in one direction.  The incident room in St. Goarshausen, near the accident
site, is operated by four German agencies including the police
and the Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt, or Federal Shipping
Administration.  The waterway will close again when the sunken vessel is
removed, said Michael Otten, a spokesman from the incident room.
Authorities don’t know how long it will take to prepare the
sunken vessel for removal, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
