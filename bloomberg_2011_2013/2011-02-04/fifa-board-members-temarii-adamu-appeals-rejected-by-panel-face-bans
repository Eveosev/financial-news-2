Two members of soccer’s governing
body who were suspended following a corruption probe into
bidding for the  World Cup  had their appeals rejected, FIFA said
today in a statement on its website.  FIFA Vice President Reynald Temarii will be banned for one
year from any soccer-related activity, and fined 5,000 Swiss
francs ($5,224), while executive committee member Amos Adamu
will face a three-year ban, and a 10,000-franc fine, according
to FIFA’s statement. The appeals committee’s two-day meeting
ended yesterday, and the November 2010 sanctions for the pair
were upheld, FIFA said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
