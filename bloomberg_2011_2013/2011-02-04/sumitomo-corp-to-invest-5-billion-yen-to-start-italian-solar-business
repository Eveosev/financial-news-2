  Sumitomo Corp . will invest as much as
5 billion yen ($61 million) to buy stakes in two units of  Germany ’s  SAG Solarstrom AG  that own 9.7 megawatts of solar
farms in Italy.  The Japanese trading company acquired a 85 percent stake in
each of the units, Sumitomo said in a statement today. It didn’t
identify the units.  The units own 10 solar power generation facilities in
Puglia, company spokesman Taro Ueno said by phone.  This will be Sumitomo’s first solar power generation
project in Italy, according to the statement. Power generated by
the projects will be sold for 20 years under Italy’s feed-in-
tariff program, it said, without giving details of the buyer.  Sumitomo advanced 2.25 percent to 1,275 yen on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, the highest since September 2008. The shares
closed at 1,250 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
