  Banco Popular Espanol SA ,  Spain ’s
third-biggest commercial bank, said fourth-quarter profit
slumped 40 percent on lower lending revenue.  Net income declined to 68.8 million euros ($93.7 million)
from 115 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based bank
said in a filing to regulators today. That’s less than the 73
million-euro average estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Spanish lenders including Popular have been hurt by higher
costs of retail and wholesale funding as they wrestle with loan
defaults in an economy that’s struggling to emerge from its
worst recession in 60 years. The bank said it expects a
“light” decline in net interest income in 2011 and may need to
continue provisioning for real estate on its books should sales
remain weak.  “2011 will be a complicated year but not without
opportunities,” Popular said.  Net interest income slid to 557.3 million euros from 703
million euros a year earlier, Popular said. Lending rose 0.9
percent as deposits gained 33 percent, the bank said.  Bad loans as a proportion of total lending rose to 5.27
percent from 4.81 percent a year earlier and 5.17 percent in
September. Popular’s core capital, a measure of financial
strength, was 9.67 percent at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter for this story:
