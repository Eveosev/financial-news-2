Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest
cocoa producer, may face an imminent fuel shortage, according to
a letter sent by an industry group to its members.  Crude oil supply problems at the  Societe Ivoirienne de
Raffinage  “could cause a petrol and gas shortage very soon,”
according to the National Federation of Industries and Services
in a letter dated yesterday and obtained by Bloomberg.  The industry group urged its members in the letter “to take
all necessary measures to prepare for this threat.”  The European Union on Jan. 14 banned transactions between
the bloc and several industries in  Ivory Coast , including the
national oil company Petroci in an attempt to starve incumbent
president  Laurent Gbagbo  of funds.  The EU sanctions could deprive the refinery of money needed
to import crude oil and expose it to “what could be a slow
disintegration,” Fadika Kassoum, director of the national oil
company, told Reuters in a Jan. 21 interview.  Gbagbo is under international pressure to cede power after
losing disputed Nov. 28 elections. The United Nations, the U.S.
and the African Union recognize his rival  Alassane Ouattara  as
president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
