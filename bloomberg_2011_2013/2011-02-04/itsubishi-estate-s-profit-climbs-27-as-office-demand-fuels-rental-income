Mitsubishi Estate Co., Japan’s
second-biggest developer, said nine-month net income climbed 27
percent as profit from leasing increased.  Net income rose to 44.4 billion yen ($544 million) for the
nine months ended Dec. 31 from 34.9 billion yen a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based company said in a statement to the stock
exchange today. Sales gained 0.8 percent to 645.8 billion yen.  Mitsubishi Estate’s average rental income advanced to the
highest level since at least 2001, led by  office space  such as
its Marunouchi Park Building in Tokyo’s main business district.
Prime office vacancy rates in the capital declined to about 4.1
percent in the three months ended December from a record a year
earlier, according to CB Richard Ellis Inc.  Operating profit, or sales minus operating costs, in the
company’s office leasing business rose 16 percent to 108.9
billion yen for the nine months ended December, the company said.  Mitsubishi Estate’s average rental income rose to 25,008
yen per tsubo as of December, the highest since at least 2001,
from 24,976 yen per tsubo as of September, the company said on
its  website  last week. One tsubo, a standard measure of property
area in Japan, is 3.3 square meters, or 35.5 square feet.  Mitsubishi Estate reiterated its full-year profit forecast
of 63 billion yen on sales of 975 billion yen.  Shares of Mitsubishi Estate gained 0.4 percent to 1,590 yen
as of 2:06 p.m. in Tokyo, paring an earlier gain of as much as
2.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
