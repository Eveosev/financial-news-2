  Zorlu Enerji Elektrik Uretim AS , a
Turkish power utility, has won a $36.8 million loan from the
 Asian Development Bank  to expand its wind farm in  Pakistan .  The loan will help Zorlu Enerji install additional  wind
turbines  to increase the capacity at its project in southern
Sindh province to 56.4 megawatts from 6 megawatts, the Manila-
based ADB said in a  statement  on its website.  The loan is for 12 years with a two-year grace period.  Expansion of the farm, located about 100 kilometers (62
miles) northeast of Karachi, will cost $147 million and is
expected to be completed by 2012.  The project will be financed with 30 percent equity from
Zorlu Enerji. The remaining 70 percent will be financed through
the dollar-denominated loans from the ADB, the International
Finance Corp., and the ECO Trade and Development Bank, as well
as a Pakistan rupee loan from Karachi-based  Habib Bank Ltd ., it
said.  The project will supply power to the national grid through
a 20-year power purchase agreement with Pakistan’s National
Transmission and Dispatch Company.  Pakistan has set a 6 percent target of renewable energy by
2030. Zorlu Enerji’s project is Pakistan’s first privately owned
and financed wind farm, the ADB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
