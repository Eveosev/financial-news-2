  Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared
wireless venture is considering bidding on satellite companies  TerreStar Corp . and DBSD North America Inc., according to two
people with knowledge of the company’s plans.  The two companies’ spectrum holdings would help
LightSquared handle wireless traffic as it prepares to roll out
a nationwide fourth-generation network, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the plans aren’t public.
LightSquared is backed by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners
hedge fund.  LightSquared bids would set up a potential battle between
Falcone and Charlie Ergen.  Dish Network Corp ., where Ergen is
chief executive officer, said this week it reached agreement to
buy DBSD for about $1 billion. DBSD, which filed for bankruptcy
in May 2009, is a unit of Kirkland, Washington-based ICO Global
Communications Ltd.  TerreStar, also in bankruptcy, has a confirmation hearing
on March 4 for approval of a reorganization plan in which
control may go to  EchoStar Corp ., where Ergen is chairman.
TerreStar is also looking for an asset sale that would give
creditors more money, and is proposing bonuses for its top
executives if such a deal is reached.  A sale with an implied value of $1.22 billion would open a
$6.5 million pool of bonuses and a sale with a value higher than
$1.25 billion would bring them $8.3 million. A hearing for
approval of the bonuses is set for Feb. 22.  Stocks Rise  EchoStar, based in Englewood, Colorado, and New York-based
Harbinger are TerreStar’s largest shareholders, according to
Bloomberg data.  TerreStar added 5 cents, or 40 percent, to 16 cents in
over-the-counter trading, after touching 18 cents. ICO shares
rose 3 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $1.64 at 4 p.m.  New York  time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, after touching $1.80 earlier.  Under an agreement with the Federal Communications
Commission, LightSquared is required to build a network that
covers up to 100 million Americans by the end of 2012 and 260
million by 2016. The company plans to offer space on its network
wholesale to retailers, computer manufacturers and consumer
electronics makers, allowing companies such as  Apple Inc . and  Sony Corp . to sell their own wireless service in competition
with existing providers.  LightSquared will use  JPMorgan Chase & Co . as their bankers
on the bid, said one of the people.  Tom Surface, a spokesman for Reston, Virginia-based
LightSquared, declined to comment. Chris Fallon, a spokeswoman
for Reston, Virginia-based TerreStar; Christopher Doherty, a
spokesman for ICO; and Marc Lumpkin, a Dish spokesman, also
declined comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
