U.S. stocks rose, reversing losses
and sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level
since June 2008, after the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly
dropped and more companies beat earnings estimates.    Tyson Foods Inc ., the largest U.S. meat processor, and  JDS
Uniphase Corp ., the nation’s biggest network-analysis company,
advanced at least 5.6 percent as profits beat analyst estimates.  Aetna Inc ., the health insurer whose earnings also exceeded
projections, jumped 12 percent after raising its dividend.  Research In Motion Ltd . added 1.6 percent after Morgan Stanley
raised its stock rating for the maker of BlackBerry smartphones.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.3 percent to 1,310.87 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The benchmark gauge has risen 2.7 percent since Jan. 28,
snapping two weeks of declines. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
increased 29.89 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,092.15. Earlier
today, stocks fell as concern grew that Egyptian riots may
intensify over the weekend.  “It’s just a slow and steady recovery,” said  Timothy Ghriskey , chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management
in  Bedford Hills ,  New York , which manages $2 billion. “Things
are improving,” he said. “This market has been resilient
through the Egyptian crisis. That strength has to do with better
U.S. fundamentals.”  Earnings Watch  The S&P 500 has risen 94 percent from its March 2009 low,
the biggest rally over equivalent time periods since 1936, amid
government efforts to stimulate the economy and higher-than-
estimated corporate profits. Almost three-quarters of the 287
companies in the S&P 500 that have reported quarterly earnings
since Jan. 10 have topped analysts’ projections for per-share
profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 9 percent in
January, the lowest level since April 2009, while payrolls rose
less than forecast, depressed by winter storms. Employers added
36,000 workers, the smallest gain in four months, after a
121,000 rise in December that was larger than initially
reported. Payrolls were projected to climb 146,000, according to
the median economist forecast in a survey.  The  Federal Reserve  is unlikely to raise interest rates for
at least 12 months because the  U.S. economy  isn’t generating
enough growth to lower unemployment, Pacific Investment
Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  said. The Fed would probably like to
see the economy adding at least 200,000 jobs a month before
considering rate increases, Gross said in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  ‘Miracle Growth’  “While we expect the unemployment rate to get better, we
don’t see miracle growth,” said Tim Evnin, equity portfolio
manager at Evercore Wealth Management, which has $2.5 billion
under management. “Between weather and revisions, there are too
many crosscurrents. It’s going to start getting better at some
point in time, but sort of remains to be seen.”  Equities also turned lower earlier today as yields on 10-
and Treasuries surged to the highest level in nine months,
spurring concern that higher borrowing costs will slow the
economic rebound.  “Bottom line, higher rates do hurt stock prices,” said
Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading LLC
in Chatham, New Jersey. “Good economic news could potentially
now be bad for stocks because it could send  interest rates  up.”  ‘Game Over’  Stocks also fell earlier today as unrest in Egypt
continued. Protests poured out of prayer services and filled
Cairo’s Tahrir Square on what demonstrators called the “day of
departure” for President Hosni Mubarak. Tens of thousands
gathered to sing the national anthem and chant slogans against
Mubarak, repeatedly calling the president and his regime
“illegitimate.” One held a sign reading: “Game Over.”  Tyson Foods gained 5.7 percent to $18.56. The largest U.S.
meat processor reported fiscal first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as pork and chicken income increased.
Excluding a 3-cent gain from the sale of interests in an
investment, profit was 75 cents, topping the 62-cent average
estimate of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales rose 15
percent to $7.62 billion from $6.64 billion.  JDS Uniphase jumped 25 percent to $22.34 after the company
beat analysts’ projections for second-quarter per-share earnings
excluding some items by 49 percent. Third-quarter revenue will
be $440 million to $460 million, the company said. Analysts
projected $420.9 million, on average.  Aetna, RIM  Aetna increased 12 percent to $37.42. The third-biggest
U.S. health insurer said its board approved a quarterly cash
dividend of 15 cents a share. The company previously paid a
dividend of 4 cents annually. Aetna today reported fourth-
quarter profit of 63 cents a share on an operating basis,
topping the average analyst estimate of 62 cents.  Research In Motion rose 1.6 percent to $63.69. The maker of
the BlackBerry smartphone was raised to “equal-weight” from
“underweight” at Morgan Stanley.    Las Vegas Sands Corp . declined 8.5 percent to $46.03. The
U.S. casino company expanding in Asia posted fourth-quarter
sales that missed analyst estimates.  U.S. Steel Corp., the country’s largest producer of the
metal by volume, dropped 4.1 percent to $58.17.  AK Steel Holding
Corp . declined 3 percent to $15.84. UBS AG said both companies
may be hurt most by lower prices.    Coinstar Inc . slumped 12 percent to $38.96. The operator of
the Redbox DVD rental machines forecast first-quarter earnings
from continuing operations of no more than 25 cents a share.
Analysts projected an average of 57 cents a share, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
