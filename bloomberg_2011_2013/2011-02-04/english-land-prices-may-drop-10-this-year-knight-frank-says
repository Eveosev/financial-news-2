Residential land prices in England
may drop as much as 10 percent this year as banks sell
distressed property,  Knight Frank  LLP said.  “There’s been a big recovery in the past two years,”  Liam Bailey , head of residential research at the London-based
property broker, said by telephone. “That’s now petering out.”  Urban land prices increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier, the smallest gain for 12 months, Knight
Frank said today in a statement. Values declined 1 percent from
the previous three months.  “There is a risk that with an increasing level of stock
coming into the market out of bank restructuring, supply will
begin to rise just as demand is falling back,” Bailey said.  U.K. land prices are about 40 percent below their 2007
peak, Knight Frank estimates. That has prompted homebuilders to
buy cheaper plots in an attempt to improve their profit margins.  The U.K. housing market may have weakened as the prospect
of the biggest government budget squeeze since World War II and
tighter lending conditions hurt demand.  Home prices  contracted
0.2 percent in December from the previous month, the  Land
Registry  said Jan. 31.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc plans to sell distressed
properties valued at about 100 million pounds, the Financial
Times reported on Jan. 28, without saying where it got the
information. Lloyds is the U.K.’s biggest mortgage lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
