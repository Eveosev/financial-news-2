Danyland Ltd., a subsidiary of Dwyka
Diamonds Ltd., started drilling nickel deposits in Burundi to
establish their commercial viability after four years of surface
exploration, the Energy and Minerals Ministry said.  Results of the drilling will determine whether the company
embarks on commercial production, Damien Riragonya, an adviser
to the Burundian energy and minerals ministers, said today in an
interview in the Ugandan capital, Kampala.  “They have done surface exploration and now they want to
evaluate the drill results and determine whether to go into
mining,” he said.  Danyland is exploring for the metal in the Muremera area,
close to Tanzania’s Kabanga project, one of the largest known
undeveloped nickel deposits in  Africa , he said.  Burundi’s nickel-ore reserves stretch from the south to the
northeast of the country, he said. The government of the east-
central African nation is considering road, rail and power
projects to encourage mining if commercially-viable deposits are
discovered, said Riragonya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
