Japanese stocks rose, sending
benchmark indexes to their highest levels since Jan. 19, as
steelmakers surged on a merger proposal and some company
earnings improved.    Nippon Steel Corp ., Japan’s largest steelmaker, jumped 9.1
percent after announcing a plan to combine with  Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd ., which soared 16 percent. Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 1 publicly traded bank, gained
0.9 percent after profit more than doubled. Sony Corp., Japan’s
biggest exporter of consumer electronics, climbed 1.8 percent
after reporting profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  If the merger proposal triggers further consolidation, that
will likely make “a good impact” on investors’ outlook for the
Japanese economy, said  Ayako Sera , a strategist in Tokyo at
Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which manages about $331 billion.
“Company earnings are improving this year, beating the market
consensus.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.1 percent to 10,543.52
at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix gained 0.8 percent to
935.36, with more than three times as many shares advancing as
declining. For the week, the  Nikkei 225  climbed 1.8 percent,
while the Topix increased 1.7 percent. Both gauges gained for a
second week.  Steelmakers had the biggest increase in the Topix among its
33 industry groups. Nippon Steel jumped 9.1 percent to 313 yen
and Sumitomo Metal Industries surged 16 percent to 224 yen. They
were the two largest contributors to the Topix’s gain.  Steelmakers’ Merger  Japan’s No. 1 and No. 3 steelmakers plan to combine to cut
costs in what may be the country’s biggest non-bank takeover,
aimed at gaining leverage over raw-material purchases and
pricing of the metal as costs soar.  “Expectations are increasing for improved performance in
the  steel industry ,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at
Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “If domestic competition is
mitigated, there’s more chance of guaranteeing profit margins.”  The proposed merger between Sumitomo Metal Industries and
Nippon Steel will create synergies for both companies as well as
benefit “the wider steel industry by helping to increase
pricing and margins,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts Rajeev
Das and Nana Hasegawa said in a report dated today.  Mitsubishi UFJ rose 0.9 percent to 440 yen. The lender
joined smaller rival Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in posting
third-quarter profit that more than doubled as bad-loan costs
fell. Mizuho, Japan’s No. 3 publicly traded lender, was
unchanged at 162 yen, after rising as much as 2.5 percent
earlier today.  U.S. Jobs  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2 percent
yesterday in  New York  as retailers gained after sales exceeded
projections and U.S. applications for jobless benefits decreased
by 42,000 to 415,000 in the week ended Jan. 29. Economists had
forecast claims would fall to 420,000, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  The Topix has gained 4.1 percent this year. Stocks in the
index were valued at 16 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 13.6 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
11.3 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  This week is the peak for quarterly results in Japan, with
more than a third of the Topix index’s 1,668 companies scheduled
to report earnings. Of the 803 companies that have posted net
income since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 117 have exceeded
analysts’ estimates, while 88 have missed them, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sony Earnings  Sony, the maker of Bravia televisions, gained 1.8 percent
to 2,919 yen. The company reported net income of 72.3 billion
yen ($886 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, beating
the 65.9 billion yen average of six analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Hitachi, a maker of products from home appliances
to nuclear reactors, advanced 3 percent to 487 yen after raising
its full-year net-income forecast 15 percent, citing cost cuts.  Softbank Corp., the exclusive provider of  Apple Inc .’s
iPhone in Japan, rallied 3.6 percent to 2,976 yen, the single
largest contributor to the Nikkei 225, after boosting its annual
operating profit forecast 20 percent, citing demand for the
touch-screen smartphone. Softbank was the third-most active
stock by value in Japan, following Sumitomo Metal Industries and
Nippon Steel.  Jtekt Corp., an autoparts maker, soared 7.8 percent to
1,159 yen and had the third-biggest advance in the Nikkei, after
CLSA Asia Pacific Markets boosted the stock price estimate to
1,250 yen from 1,100 yen, maintaining the “outperform” rating.
Jtekt had a return to a nine-month profit from a year-earlier
loss, the company said in a release before the market closed
yesterday.  Mazda Motor Corp., Japan’s second-largest car exporter,
sank 4.6 percent to 227 yen and had the sharpest fall in the
Nikkei, after turning into a loss in the three months ended Dec.
31. Mazda posted a third-quarter net loss of 2.67 billion yen
after a stronger yen cut the competitiveness of its exports.  To contact the reporter for this story:
