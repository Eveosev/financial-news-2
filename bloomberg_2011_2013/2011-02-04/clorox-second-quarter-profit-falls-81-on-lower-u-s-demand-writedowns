  Clorox Co ., the maker of cleaners
including its namesake bleach and Pine-Sol, said second-quarter
profit declined 81 percent on slumping demand and charges tied
to the value of its businesses.  Net income dropped to $21 million, or 15 cents a share,
from $110 million, or 77 cents, a year earlier, the Oakland,
California-based company said today in a statement. Excluding
results related to the sale of its auto business, profit was 68
cents a share. Sales fell 3 percent to $1.18 billion.  Chief Executive Officer Don Knauss said the second quarter
was “challenging” because of the Venezuela currency
devaluation and more difficult comparisons to last year, when
the company benefited from flu-related sales. Clorox last month
cut the top end of its revenue forecast for the year, citing
increasing promotional spending and  Venezuela . About 80 percent
of sales come from the U.S.  Clorox in September agreed to sell its underperforming STP
and Armor All auto-care business to private-equity firm Avista
Capital Partners for about $780 million. Knauss is counting on
products including  Hidden Valley Ranch  salad dressing and
scented trash bags to spur sales growth.  The second quarter included a $258 million expense to write
down the value of the Burt’s Bees skin-care business.  Clorox fell 55 cents to $63.20 at 9:49 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 3.7 percent
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
