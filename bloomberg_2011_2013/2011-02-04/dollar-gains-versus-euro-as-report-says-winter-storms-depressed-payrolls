The dollar advanced for a third day
against the euro and yen in the longest stretch of gains in four
weeks after the U.S. jobless rate fell to the lowest level since
April 2009 even as winter storms limited gains in payrolls.  Canada’s currency touched a two-year high versus the dollar
as the nation’s employment rose more than four times economists’
forecasts. Egypt’s pound held near a six-year low as protesters
proclaimed the “day of departure” for President  Hosni Mubarak .
The greenback climbed against most its major counterparts as
benchmark Treasury yields rose on the U.S. jobs data, making
dollar-denominated assets more attractive.  “As the focus shifted to the  unemployment rate  instead of
the headline nonfarm payrolls, we saw euro-dollar breaking
lower,” said Mary Nicola, a currency strategist at BNP Paribas
SA in New York. “Risk appetite today will be hard to determine
as events in Egypt unfold.”  The dollar appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.3581 per euro at 5
p.m. in New York, from $1.3634 yesterday, after touching
$1.3544, the strongest level since Jan. 24. The dollar climbed
0.7 percent to 82.18 yen, from 81.63. The euro gained 0.3
percent to 111.62 yen, from 111.29.  U.S. unemployment unexpectedly dropped to 9 percent last
month from 9.4 percent in December, the Labor Department said
today in  Washington . Employers added 36,000 workers, the
smallest gain in four months, after a 121,000 rise that was
larger than initially reported.  Drop in Treasuries  Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year note yields to 3.64
percent, the highest level since May 3. Thirty-year bond yields
touched 4.74 percent, the highest since April 15.  The Swiss franc fell against all its major counterparts
after the U.S. and Canadian employment reports, dropping as much
as 1.5 percent against the dollar to 95.94 centimes.  The currency, perceived as a haven, declined 0.6 percent to
1.2973 against the euro after a report showed yesterday that  Europe ’s services and manufacturing industries expanded at the
fastest pace in nine months in January.    Egypt ’s stock market and banking system remained closed
amid anti-government protests, shielding the Egyptian pound,
which touched 5.8585 against the dollar on Jan. 31, the weakest
since January 2005.  The  Suez Canal , which carries about 8 percent of global
maritime trade, was operating normally today, Egyptian
authorities said.  Israel ’s shekel dropped 0.3 percent to 3.7196.  The euro weakened 0.2 percent versus the dollar during the
week as European Union leaders met in Brussels to try to narrow
differences on ending the region’s debt crisis.  Debt Safety Net  Germany and  France  are at odds over possible bond buybacks
and a “competitiveness pact,” which is German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s condition for strengthening the safety net for
debt-strapped countries.  The 17-nation currency may fall 2.3 percent to $1.3246 if
it weakens below $1.3498, said  George Davis , chief technical
analyst for fixed income and currency strategy at Royal Bank of
Canada in Toronto, in a phone interview.  “That is the pivot point for bullish and bearish
sentiment,” Davis said. “If that level breaks on the downside,
some of the people that had positioned in medium- to long-term
positions in the euro are going to start to cash in and exit.”  Canada’s currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 98.73 cents
per  U.S. dollar  on the nation’s job gains after touching 98.32
cents, the strongest level since May 2008. The loonie advanced
1.1 percent to 83.24 yen.  Canadian Jobs  Statistics Canada reported that employment rose by 69,200,
compared with the median forecast of 15,000 in a Bloomberg News
survey of 26 economists. The jobless rate rose to 7.8 percent
from 7.6 percent. Full-time employment rose by 31,100 in
January, and part-time jobs increased by 38,000.  “It’s a blowout number,” said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director for foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Montreal’s BMO
Capital Markets in Toronto. “What we need to see is this part-
time significant increase move more into the full-time area.”  The Canadian employment report restores the nation’s status
as having regained all the jobs lost in the recession. A Jan. 28
revision based on updated census data reduced  Statistics
Canada ’s estimate of total employment.  The euro fell 1.3 percent yesterday, the most since
November, as European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
said inflation has been prompted “mainly” by rising energy and
commodity costs, dimming prospects for a boost in the target
lending rate from a record low 1 percent.  Bernanke on Economy  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday in a speech in
Washington that the U.S. needs to see faster job growth for a
sufficient time before policy makers can be assured the economic
recovery has taken hold.  Bad weather prevented 886,000 Americans from going to work
in the January survey week, the Labor Department’s survey of
households showed today. That compares with an average of
282,000 over the previous five Januarys.  Economists at Morgan Stanley said before the report a
figure around 475,000 would be consistent with about a 50,000
reduction in overall payrolls.  To contact the reporters on this story:
