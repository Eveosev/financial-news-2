Zambia is targeting to more than
double copper production within the next five years,  Situmbeko Musokotwane , the finance minister, said.  The southern African country is targeting output of 2
million metric tons of the metal by 2015, Musokotwane told
reporters today in Lusaka, the capital. Zambia produced about
820,000 tons of copper last year, according to provisional data
from the central bank.  The increase “is due to increased investment in existing
mines and the opening of new mines,” Musokotwane said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
