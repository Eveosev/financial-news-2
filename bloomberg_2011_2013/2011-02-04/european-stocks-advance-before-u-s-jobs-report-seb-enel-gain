European stocks gained as data showed
the jobless rate in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped last month
even as payrolls were depressed by winter storms.    YIT Oyj  rallied 10 percent as profit also beat forecasts.  Enel SpA  gained 1 percent as earnings topped estimates. William
Morrison Supermarkets Plc, the U.K.’s fourth-largest supermarket
chain and  Munich Re , the world’s biggest reinsurer, rallied as
analysts upgraded their recommendations on the stocks.  LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA  slid 2.4 percent after operating
profit failed to exceed analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.3 percent to 285.9 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London as almost two shares gained for each
one that fell. The measure has surged 23 percent since its low
in May 2010 amid optimism that the  U.S. economy  is strengthening
and as European governments implemented policies to support
indebted countries using the single currency.  “The drop in the  unemployment rate  was clearly a massive
change and has to be welcomed,” said Philippe Gijsels, the
Brussels-based head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global
Markets. “Still, the job market remains fairly weak and this
remains the focal point for the  Federal Reserve , for them to
continue on the path of quantitative easing.”  National benchmark indexes rose in 13 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.2 percent,
while Germany’s DAX rose 0.3 percent. France’s CAC advanced 0.3
percent.  Destabilize Region  The Stoxx 600 has gained 1.9 percent this week, rebounding
from a two-week retreat even as investors continued to speculate
that protests against Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  may
destabilize the region.  Egyptian protesters poured out of Friday prayer services
and filled Cairo’s Tahrir Square on what demonstrators called
the “day of departure.”  Tens of thousands gathered to sing the national anthem and
chant slogans against Mubarak, repeatedly calling the president
and his regime “illegitimate.” One held a sign reading: “Game
Over.” Many brought their children in a sign of the changed
mood after Mubarak supporters yesterday attacked protesters,
journalists and observers, leaving several people dead.  In the U.S., unemployment declined to 9 percent last month
from 9.4 percent in December, the Labor Department said today in  Washington . Employment rose by 36,000 workers, the smallest gain
in four months, after a 121,000 rise in December that was larger
than initially reported. Payrolls were projected to climb
146,000, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey.  YIT rallied 10 percent to 19.63 euros as Finland’s biggest
builder reported fourth-quarter net income of 81.5 million
euros, beating the 60.4 million-euro mean estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Enel, Morrison       Enel, Italy’s biggest energy company, said earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization increased to 17.5
billion euros ($23.9 billion) from 16.4 billion euros a year
earlier. That beat the 17 billion-euro mean estimate of 31
analysts surveyed. The stock gained 1 percent to 4.22 euros.  Taylor Wimpey Plc, the U.K.’s second-largest homebuilder by
volume, advanced 6.9 percent to 37.41 pence. U.K. house prices
unexpectedly rose in January as fewer homeowners put their
properties up for sale, squeezing supply, according to a report
from Halifax.  Separately, Fitch Ratings Ltd. revised Taylor Wimpey’
outlook to “positive.”  Morrison, Munich Re       Morrison climbed 2.8 percent to 278.9 pence. Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. raised the shares to “outperform” from

from “neutral.”  Munich Re advanced 2.7 percent to 120.20 euros. The shares
were raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan.    Barclays Plc  and  Unicredit SpA  advanced as equity
strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded the region’s
banks to “overweight.” Barclays, the U.K.’s third biggest
bank, climbed 2.4 percent to 308.1 pence. UniCredit, Italy’s
largest, advanced 2.1 percent, to 1.88 euros.    Teleperformance  surged 6.4 percent to 28 euros as the
customer-services provider said fourth-quarter revenue rose to
588.1 million euros from 475.5 million euros a year earlier.    Grifols SA  advanced 5 percent to 11.89 euros as Europe’s
largest maker of blood-plasma products agreed with U.S.
regulators to extend the deadline for antitrust approval of the
$3.6 billion purchase of Talecris Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp.
until March 6.  LVMH, Yara  LVMH, the world’s largest maker of luxury goods, slid 2.4
percent to 114.05 euros after 2010 operating profit failed to
beat analysts’ estimates.
      Yara International ASA  sank 2.4 percent to 328 kronor as it
forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization of about 3 billion kroner ($523 million) for the
fourth quarter. That was less than analysts’ estimates.    Nordea Bank AB  retreated 5.2 percent to 74.35 kronor.
Sweden sold part of its stake in the Nordic region’s largest
lender in a move that will reduce state debt by as much as $3
billion.    Neste Oil Oyj  sank 6.4 percent to 13.23 euros as Finland’s
only oil refiner said it sees steeper operating loss at its
renewable fuels unit this quarter than in the final three months
of last year. The company also said it expects a full-year
operating loss at the unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
