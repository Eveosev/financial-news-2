Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic pulled out of an indoor tournament next week in the
Netherlands, tournament organizers said.  The third-ranked Serb has withdrawn from the  ABN Amro World
Tennis Tournament  in Rotterdam with a shoulder injury, the
organizers said in an e-mail today.  Djokovic on Jan. 30 beat Britain’s Andy Murray 6-4, 6-2, 6-
3 to clinch his second Australian Open trophy in  Melbourne . The
fifth-ranked Murray, who has now lost all three Grand Slam
finals he’s appeared in, is scheduled to play in the event,
which starts Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
