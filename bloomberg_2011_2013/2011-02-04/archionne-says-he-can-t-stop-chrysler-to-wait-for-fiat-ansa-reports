  Fiat SpA  and Chrysler Group LLC Chief
Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said he “can’t stop”
Chrysler’s revamp “to wait” for Fiat to resolve its production
issues, speaking to reporters late yesterday in Detroit, Ansa
reported.  Marchionne said that “one part of the global project of
Fiat is in the U.S, the other is in Europe. Our challenge is to
join those parts.” The executive made his comments after
meeting Piedmont region Governor Roberto Cota.  The project to revive the U.S. automaker, begun 19 months
ago, is “going very well,” the executive said, according to
Ansa newswire.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
