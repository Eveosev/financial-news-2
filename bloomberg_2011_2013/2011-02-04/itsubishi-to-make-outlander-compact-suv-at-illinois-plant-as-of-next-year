  Mitsubishi Motors Corp ., a Japanese
automaker that’s aiming to boost sales in the U.S., will start
building the Outlander sport-utility vehicle at its Illinois
plant as it plans to overhaul the factory.  Starting in mid-2012, Mitsubishi will make the compact
Outlander, a model that is currently imported to the U.S. from
Japan, at the plant in Normal, Illinois, the Tokyo-based company
said in a statement today. The facility builds Galant sedans,
Eclipse coupes, Spyder convertibles and Endeavor SUVs.  After about $45 million is invested in tooling and
equipment and $55 million by suppliers, the facility will be
able to produce about 50,000 Outlanders, half of which are
intended for export, said Dan Irvin, a Mitsubishi spokesman. The
state of  Illinois  is providing about $29 million of support for
the investment, Mitsubishi said in the statement.  Output at the Normal factory, which opened in 1988 as a
joint venture between Mitsubishi and the former Chrysler Corp.,
has plunged in the past eight years, falling to about 31,000
units last year from 204,234 in 2002. The slide reflects
Mitsubishi’s volatile U.S. sales, which totaled 55,683 last
year, down from 345,111 in 2002.  The plant has 1,300 employees and runs a single production
shift, with capacity to make 135,000 vehicles a year, according
to the company’s  website . Unlike at U.S. plants of  Toyota Motor
Corp ., Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co., about 1,000
production and maintenance staff at the Normal factory are
represented by the United Auto Workers union.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Alan Ohnsman  in  Los Angeles  at
