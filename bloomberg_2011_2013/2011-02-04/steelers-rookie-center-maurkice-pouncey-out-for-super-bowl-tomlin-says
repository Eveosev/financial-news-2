Pittsburgh Steelers Pro Bowl center
Maurkice Pouncey won’t play in the Super Bowl, coach Mike Tomlin
said.  Pouncey ended his season with an ankle injury sustained in
the American Football Conference championship game on Jan. 23
against the  New York Jets , Tomlin said today after the rookie
missed the final practice of the week, according to a pool
report.  Asked how Pouncey’s absence will affect the Steelers’ game
plan, Tomlin said, “It won’t. Obviously we have a plan and that
won’t change.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
