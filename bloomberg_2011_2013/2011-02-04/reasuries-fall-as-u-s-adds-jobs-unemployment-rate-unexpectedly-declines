Treasuries fell, pushing the 10-year
note yield to the highest in nine months, after the U.S.
unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped to the lowest level since
April 2009, fueling speculation the labor market will improve.  U.S. 30-year bond yields also reached a nine-month high as
Labor Department data showed the jobless rate fell to 9 percent
last month and employers added 36,000 jobs, less than forecast,
as storms swept the nation. A report yesterday showed gains in  service industries . The  Federal Reserve  bought $7.27 billion of
Treasuries, less than average, as part of a stimulus program.  “The overall tone of economic data has been positive, and
the market has been acknowledging that,” said Thomas Simons, a
government-debt economist in New York at Jefferies Group Inc.,
one of the 20 primary dealers that trade with the central bank.
“It’s still not a tremendously satisfying pace of recovery, but
things are moving right along.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield climbed eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.64 percent 5:01 p.m. in
New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. It touched 3.66
percent, the highest level since May 4, and increased 31 basis
points for the week. The price of the 2.625 percent security
maturing in November 2020 fell 5/8, or $6.25 per $1,000 face
amount, to 91 3/4.  Thirty-year bond yields advanced as much as eight basis
points to 4.74 percent, the highest level since April 15. Two-
year yields reached 0.76 percent, the highest since June 15.  The difference between yields on 2- and 10-year Treasuries
increased to the widest in almost a year. It reached 291 basis
points, the most since Feb. 23, 2010.  ‘Statistical Anomaly’  Last month’s gain in nonfarm payrolls was the smallest
increase in four months and followed a 121,000-job rise in
December that was larger than initially reported. Payrolls were
projected to climb by 146,000 positions, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  The jobless rate decreased for a second month. A Bloomberg
survey had forecast it would advance to 9.5 percent, from 9.4
percent in December.  “This is one of those lies, damned lies and statistics
moments,” said Mitchell Stapley, the  Grand Rapids , Michigan-
based chief fixed-income officer for Fifth Third Asset
Management, which oversees $22 billion. “You saw that 9
percent, and the market’s reaction was ‘that can’t be right.’
You’ve got people dropping out of the workforce. There’s some
statistical anomaly at work.”  Payrolls in construction and transportation, industries
most affected by bad weather, dropped in January, while factory
employment rose the most since August 1998.  Rate Boost Unlikely  The Fed is unlikely to raise  interest rates  for at least 12
months because the  U.S. economy  isn’t generating enough growth
to lower unemployment, Pacific Investment Management Co.’sBill Gross said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance”
with  Tom Keene .  The central bank would probably like to see the economy
adding at least 200,000 jobs a month before considering rate
increases, said  Newport Beach , Calif.-based Gross, manager of
the world’s biggest bond fund. Policy makers have held the
benchmark interest rate near zero since December 2008.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a speech yesterday in  Washington  the nation needs to see faster job growth for a
sufficient time before policy makers can be assured the economic
recovery has taken hold.  Treasuries dropped yesterday as a report from the  Institute
for Supply Management  showed U.S. service industries, which
account for 90 percent of the U.S. economy, grew in January at
the fastest pace since 2005.  Bond Loss    U.S. government debt  has lost 3.4 percent since Nov. 5,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, when the
Labor Department announced that employment increased in October
for the first time in five months.  The central bank last month maintained its $600 billion
bond-purchase program, saying the pace of economic expansion is
insufficient to lower unemployment. The Fed bought Treasuries
today maturing from August 2013 to September 2014. It acquired
25.2 percent of the securities that holders offered, compared
with an average 31.4 percent for the past 10 purchases.  While Bernanke said yesterday growth will pick up this year
and the Fed’s purchases of Treasuries are “providing
significant support to  job creation  and the economy,” he gave
no indication whether he’ll maintain or adjust monetary stimulus
after the asset buying-program ends in June.  Treasuries gained in 2010 as an  unemployment rate  hovering
near 10 percent and record low inflation helped stoke investor
demand for safety. They returned 5.9 percent after losing 3.7
percent in 2009, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
Treasury Master index.  Price Index  The central bank’s preferred price index, which is tied to
spending patterns and excludes food and fuel, increased 0.7
percent in December from a year earlier, Commerce Department
data showed on Jan. 31. It was the smallest rise since records
began in 1959.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the securities, widened to
2.36 percentage points from a 2010 low of 1.47 in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
