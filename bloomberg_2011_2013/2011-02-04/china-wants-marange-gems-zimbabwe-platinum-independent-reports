Export-Import Bank of  China  has
proposed lending Zimbabwe $3 billion in exchange for control
over the revenue of gems from the Marange diamond fields and 30
million ounces of platinum reserves, the  Zimbabwe  Independent
reported, citing government documents that it obtained.  Under the agreement the bank would get deposits in the
Selous and Northfields areas west of the capital, Harare, in a
concession covering 110 square kilometers, the newspaper said.  China wants Zimbabwe to spend the money on agriculture,
fertilizer manufacturing and drugmaking, the newspaper said,
citing unidentified people. Tendai Biti, Zimbabwe’s finance
minister,  confirmed talks over a loan from China without giving
further details, the Independent said.  The country’s government is divided over whether to accept
the loan, the newspaper said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
