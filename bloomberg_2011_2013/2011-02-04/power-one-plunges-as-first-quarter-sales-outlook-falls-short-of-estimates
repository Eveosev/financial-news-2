  Power-One Inc ., a maker of electrical
inverters for solar panels, fell the most in almost nine months
in New York after management issued sales guidance for the first
quarter that trailed analysts’ expectations.  Power-One dropped $2.67, or 23 percent, to $9.08 as of 9:58
a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Earlier it reached $8.98,
the biggest intra-day decline since May 6. Before today, the
shares had more than tripled in the last 12 months.  Sales in the first quarter will be $260 million to $290
million, lower than the $294 million average estimate of 13
analysts compiled by Bloomberg, Power-One said in a statement
after the close of regular trading yesterday.  Wintry weather and reductions in renewable energy
incentives in  Europe  slowed installations and created excess
inventories, the Camarillo, California-based company said in the
statement.  “Our expectation for continued higher sales in the first
quarter was clearly too optimistic,” Mark Bachman, an analyst
at Auriga Securities in  New York , said today in a note to
clients. He lowered Power-One’s price target to $13 a share from
$14 and maintained a ‘buy’ rating on the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
