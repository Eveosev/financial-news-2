Treasuries fell for a fifth day and
the dollar gained after the U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly
dropped to the lowest level since April 2009. U.S. benchmark
stock gauges returned to the highest levels in 2½ years.  Ten-year Treasury note yields rose 10 basis points to 3.64
percent, the highest since May, at 4 p.m. in New York. The
dollar appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.3579 per euro. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index, which has rallied 94 percent from a 12-year
low in 2009, climbed 0.3 percent to 1,310.87, its highest close
since June 2008. Canada’s currency rose to a 32-month high
against the dollar as the nation added more jobs than forecast.  The U.S. jobless rate for January dropped to 9 percent,
below the 9.5 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists, even as employment increased at one-fourth the
projected rate after winter storms depressed hiring.  “We’re along the path to recovery,” said James Gaul, a
money manager at Boston Advisors LLC in  Boston , which manages
$1.7 billion. “The picture overall looks better. However,
chances are we might need another full year to see consistent
gains in payrolls.”  Thirty-year Treasury yields jumped seven basis points to
4.74 percent, the highest level since April. The difference
between yields on 2- and 10-year Treasuries increased to the
widest in almost a year. The yield spread reached 291 basis
points, the most since Feb. 23, 2010.  ‘Slowly Improving’  “People are definitely looking at the economy as
improving,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government
trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage
for institutional investors. “It’s not as fast as people would
like, but it’s slowly improving. Treasury rates are certainly
rising and the stock market continues to do well.”  U.S. unemployment declined from 9.4 percent in December,
the Labor Department said. Employment rose by 36,000 workers,
the smallest gain in four months, after a 121,000 rise in
December that was larger than initially reported. Payrolls were
projected to climb 146,000, according to the median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey.  “This jobs report is somehow difficult to decipher,” said
Tim Evnin, money manager at Evercore Wealth Management, which
oversees $2.5 billion. “Between weather and revisions, there
are too many crosscurrents playing into this jobs report to draw
a strong trend. It’s going to start getting better at some point
in time, but sort of remains to be seen.”  Stocks, Dollar  Today’s gain extended the S&P 500’s advance since Jan. 28
to 2.7 percent, capping its first weekly climb in three weeks.
The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against those
of six trading partners, rallied 0.4 percent today.  Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. meat processor, rose 5.7

analysis company, rallied 27 percent as profits beat analyst
estimates. Aetna Inc., the health insurer whose earnings also
topped projections, jumped 12 percent after boosting its
dividend.    Canada ’s dollar climbed against 15 of 16 major
counterparts, led by gains of more than 1 percent versus the yen
and Swiss franc. The currency, known as the loonie for the bird
on the C$1 coin, climbed as much as 0.8 percent to $1.0171.  Canadian employment rose by 69,200 and the  labor force 
increased by  106,400,  Statistics Canada  said today. The jobless
rate rose to 7.8 percent from December’s 7.6 percent, as more
people sought work. Economists forecast 7.6 percent unemployment
and job growth of 15,000, according to the median estimates of
economists in a survey.  European Markets  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.3 percent as it rose

SpA,  Italy ’s largest utility, climbed 1 percent after profit
beat analysts’ projections. YIT Oyj,  Finland ’s largest builder,
surged 10 percent after posting net income that exceeded
forecasts. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, the world’s
largest maker of  luxury goods , fell 2.4 percent after 2010
operating profit missed expectations.  Earnings have topped estimates at about two-thirds of the
companies in the MSCI World Index that have reported results
since Jan. 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The MSCI Asia Pacific rose 0.3 percent to a two-week high.
Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics,
climbed 1.8 percent after reporting better-than-estimated
profit. Softbank Corp., the exclusive provider of Apple Inc.’s
iPhone in Japan, gained 3.6 percent after raising its profit
forecast. Nippon Steel Corp., Japan’s largest steelmaker, jumped
9.1 percent on plans to combine with Sumitomo Metal Industries

bonds instead of equivalent-maturity benchmark German debt
declined eight basis points, with the 10-year bund yield
climbing five basis points to 3.26 percent. Spain’s gross
domestic product probably advanced 0.2 percent from the third
quarter and 0.6 percent from a year earlier, the central bank
said today.  The euro weakened against 11 of 16 major peers as the
region’s leaders met in Brussels today to discuss how to defend
the currency and hold investors selling government debt at bay
until a resolution to the debt crisis is found.  Emerging-market stocks dropped after India’s Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said inflation poses a “serious threat” to
growth. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slipped 0.2 percent and  India ’s Sensex index tumbled 2.4 percent, the most in a month.  Egyptian dollar bonds rebounded from record lows this week
and confidence improved in the nation’s ability to honor debts
as economic growth prospects outweighed concern protests may
destabilize the country. The yield on  Egypt ’s 5.75 percent bond
due in 2020 fell 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to
6.452 percent at 7:25 p.m. in Cairo after reaching a peak of 7.2
percent Jan. 31.  The cost of insuring Egypt’s debt for five years with
credit-default swaps fell 15 basis points to 364 after hitting
430 on Jan. 28, the highest since April 2009, CMA prices in  London  show. The contracts remain 62 basis points higher than
before thousands of protesters took to the streets Jan. 25 to
unseat President  Hosni Mubarak .  To contact the reporters on this story:
