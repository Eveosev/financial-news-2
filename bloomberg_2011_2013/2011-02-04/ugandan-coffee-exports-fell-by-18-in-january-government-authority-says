Coffee exports from  Uganda ,  Africa ’s
largest producer of the robusta variety of the crop, fell 18
percent in January, according to the  Uganda Coffee Development
Authority .  Shipments dropped to 215,180 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags
from 263,014 bags a year earlier, the agency said in a draft
report today. Exports were 9.5 percent lower than December and
10.3 percent below an earlier forecast, the organisation said.  Low stocks resulted from a smaller-than-expected crop as
well as damage to plants, especially the robusta variety, from
insects, the authority said.  Exports during the 2010-11 season, which runs through
September, may rise 16 percent to 3.1 million bags because of
better weather conditions, the agency said on Sept. 20.  Output in Uganda slumped from more than 4 million bags in
1996-97 after coffee wilt disease destroyed the crop, according
to the authority. New planting and improving farm management may
help the country boost production to 4.5 million bags by 2015,
the authority has said.  Uganda is Africa’s second-largest coffee producer, after  Ethiopia . Robusta accounts for about 85 percent of the East
African country’s annual output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
