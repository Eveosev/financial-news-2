Oil products in the  Gulf Coast 
strengthened as Royal Dutch Shell Plc flared at its Deer Park
refinery and chemical plant in Texas and Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s
Corpus Christi East, Texas, refinery suffered a power outage.  Gasoline and diesel in the region rose to their highest
levels versus New York Mercantile Exchange futures in more than
a week.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.5 cent to 7 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the Nymex at 12:44 p.m.in New York. That’s the
narrowest discount since Jan. 25. Prompt delivery of the fuel
fell 5.99 cents to $2.3685 a gallon.    Valero Energy Corp . reported a “brief” power failure late
yesterday at its  Corpus Christi  East refinery in Texas,
according to a filing with state regulators. Lion Oil Co. said
it restarted a sulfur unit at its El Dorado, Arkansas, refinery,
after an upset caused by cold weather.  “There was flaring at Corpus Christi due to a brief power
blip, but there was no material impact to production,”  Bill Day , a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. “Power was quickly
restored.”  Valero’s 170,000-barrel-a-day McKee refinery in Texas
remained at reduced rates after issues with crude supply from a
pipeline, Day said.  The discount for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf Coast
also strengthened 0.5 cent to 1 cent a gallon versus Nymex
heating oil futures.  Gasoline in the Midwest, or Group 3, narrowed its discount
0.38 cent to 2.63 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
