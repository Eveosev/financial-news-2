  Tyson Foods Inc ., the largest U.S.
meat processor, reported fiscal first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as the company reduced costs in the chicken
unit and pork prices rose. The shares climbed as much as 8.1
percent.  Net income increased 86 percent to $298 million, or 78
cents a share, for the three months through Jan. 1, from $160
million, or 42 cents, a year earlier, Springdale, Arkansas-based
Tyson said today in a statement. Earnings excluding a 3-cent
gain from the sale of interests in an investment were 75 cents a
share. The average estimate of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey
was for profit of 62 cents.  Tyson said operating income for chicken and pork more than
doubled to $181 million and $177 million, respectively. While
Tyson expects chicken operating margins to decline as grain
costs rise $500 million this fiscal year, the company said cost
cutting, higher prices and product mix will help the unit
“remain profitable” during the rest of 2011.  “The reason people had stayed away from the stock was that
chicken would singlehandedly sink the ship,” Jeff Farmer, a
Boston-based analyst for Jefferies & Co. who rates the shares
“buy,” said today in a telephone interview. “The worst case
fears of many investors have been sidestepped.”  Tyson rose 84 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $18.40 at 9:49 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares earlier
climbed $1.42, the biggest intraday gain in a year.  Revenue Climbs  Sales increased 15 percent to $7.62 billion from $6.64
billion a year earlier, topping the $7.17 billion average
projection of 12 analysts.  The price that packers such as Tyson receive for pork has
risen about 30 percent in the past year as hog herds have
shrunk, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Tyson and other meat processors have been facing higher
feed costs as corn and soybean prices rose and reached 30-month
highs in the last week. Corn and soybean meal represented about
42 percent of Tyson’s cost of raising chicken, which made up 34
percent of its 2010 sales, the company said in a filing.  Cost cutting has helped improve the chicken unit’s
performance by $600 million since 2008 and more such
opportunities will contribute to its profitability during the
rest of fiscal 2011, Chief Executive Officer Donnie Smith said
in the statement.  “Because of the structural changes we’ve made throughout
our businesses, we are competing effectively, even within the
volatile markets we’re facing,” Smith said. “While 2011 will
have its challenges, it has the potential to be comparable to
2010.”  Tyson defines operating income as sales minus the cost of
sales, general expenses and other charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
