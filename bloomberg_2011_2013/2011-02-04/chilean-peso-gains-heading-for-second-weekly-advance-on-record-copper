Chile’s peso capped a second straight
weekly advance against the  U.S. dollar  after copper, which makes
up more than half  Chile ’s exports, rose to a record.  The peso climbed 0.1 percent to 479.1 per U.S. dollar from
479.7 yesterday. The currency has climbed 1.1 percent this week
after last week’s 1.8 percent rise.  The peso is recovering from a 6.6 percent slump in the five
days after the central bank said Jan. 3 that it would buy $12
billion in U.S. currency, as copper surges and speculation grows
that the bank would raise rates this month. Copper headed for
the biggest weekly gain in five weeks in New York as equity
markets strengthened.  “The intervention had a substantial effect, but it has
gained in the last weeks,” said Moises Junca, chief regional
currency strategist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in
Mexico City. “Copper doubtless has had the most impact. It’s at
historical records and may keep rising. The way a lot of traders
have decided to play copper is through the Chilean peso.”  Copper for March delivery reached a record of $4.614 a
pound in  New York  today. The metal accounted for $39 billion of
Chile’s $70 billion in sales abroad last year and 72 percent of
exports in the first three weeks of last month, the latest data
available from the central bank.  The central bank paid 479.11 pesos per dollar for $50
million today as part of its $12 billion dollar-buying plan to
weaken the currency. The bank has so far bought $1.15 billion at
an average of about 489.81 pesos per dollar, according to
Bloomberg calculations based in reported daily averages.  Interest-rate swap rates gained. The two-year rate climbed
12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 5.48 percent and
the one-year jumped eight basis points to 4.79 percent.  One-, two- and three-year breakeven inflation all increased
by 11 basis points. Five-year breakeven inflation climbed 12
basis points to 3.67 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Five-year central bank bond yields in pesos slid 1 basis
point to 6.55 percent, while inflation-linked bond yields in the
same maturity lost 4 basis points to 2.61, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
