  Canada ’s job creation in January was
more than four times the median forecast, pushing the Canadian
dollar to its strongest level since May 2008 and adding to
evidence the country’s economic recovery may be accelerating.  Employment rose by 69,200 and the  labor force  increased by
106,400, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The jobless
rate rose to 7.8 percent from December’s 7.6 percent, as more
people sought work. Economists forecast 7.6 percent unemployment
and job growth of 15,000, according to the median estimates of
25 and 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “This adds confidence to the notion we are headed for a
better year for growth and growth in the job market,” said  Mark Chandler , head of Canadian currency and rates strategy at Royal  Bank of Canada ’s RBC Capital Markets unit in Toronto. “There
isn’t a lot of slack in the labor market in Canada, certainly on
a relative basis to other countries.”  Canadian policy makers have been dealing with the impact of
a strong currency and a slowdown in growth of household and
government spending that crimped the economic recovery in the
second half of last year. Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
stopped raising  interest rates  after September and Finance
Minister  Jim Flaherty  scaled back plans to exit stimulus.  “It’s one of these reports that’s strong through and
through - it’s hard to find any weakness,” said  David Tulk ,
chief Canada macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD
Securities unit.  “The Bank of Canada would likely just see this as a step
towards a stronger recovery, but not a point where they would
need to respond,” he said. He predicts a July rate increase.  Dollar Strengthens  The report restores Canada’s status as having regained all
the jobs lost in the recession, after a Jan. 28 revision based
on updated census data reduced Statistics Canada’s estimate of
total employment.  The Canadian dollar gained 0.4 percent to 98.75 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 4:30 p.m. in  New York  from 99.11 cents yesterday,
after earlier touching 98.32 cents, the strongest level since
May 2008. The benchmark 10-year Canadian government bond yield
increased four basis points to 3.46 percent, the highest since
May.  Full-time employment rose by 31,100 in January, and part-
time jobs rose by 38,000,  Statistics Canada  said.  Private companies boosted their payrolls by 22,700 during
the month and public-sector employment increased by 26,400,
Statistics Canada said today.  Tax Reductions  Statistics Canada said in its Jan. 28 revisions that
employment fell 2.5 percent, or 427,900, between October 2008
and July 2009, and increased by 398,000 jobs between July 2009
and December 2010.  The Bank of Canada  said last month  that there will be
“slack” in the economy until the end of 2012 and companies
need to boost investment and labor productivity.  “Too many Canadians are still looking for work, the
economic recovery is fragile,” Flaherty said today in response
to a question in the House of Commons. “We need to continue
with our job-creating, low-tax plan.”  Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said reductions in
corporate taxes are the best way to boost employment. Liberal
Party Leader  Michael Ignatieff  has said he would cancel
legislated tax cuts if he wins the next election and use some of
the money for education and a program to support people who care
for sick and elderly family members at home.  Flaherty said he will present his next budget in March and
opposition parties have said they may vote against it, which
would trigger an election.  Today’s report said that self-employment rose by 20,100 in
January, while paid employment increased by 49,100.  Wage Growth  Average hourly wages advanced 2.6 percent in January from a
year earlier, the fastest pace since May, following a gain of
2.4 percent in December.  Employment for business, building and other support
services rose by 33,700 in January. Public administration jobs
gained 19,900, while health care and social assistance increased
15,200. Retail and wholesale employment rose by 8,300 in
January.    Wal-Mart Stores Inc ., the world’s largest retailer, said
Jan. 26 it will open 40 “supercenters” in Canada by the end of
January 2012, creating 9,200 construction and store jobs.  Transportation and warehousing jobs fell by 31,900 and
accommodation and food services employment declined by 25,900,
the report said.  The U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly fell in January to the
lowest level since April 2009, while payrolls rose by 36,000
workers, the smallest gain in four months, the Labor Department
said today in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
