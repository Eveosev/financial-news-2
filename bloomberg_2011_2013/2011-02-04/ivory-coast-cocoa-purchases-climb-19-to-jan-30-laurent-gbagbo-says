Cocoa farmers in  Ivory Coast  sold 19
percent more beans in the four months to Jan. 30, and will
exceed the projected total season output of 1.2 million metric
tons, according to incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo .  Purchases totaled 904,000 tons in the period, compared with
759,000 tons a year earlier, he said in a statement published in
state-owned Fraternite Matin newspaper today. Customs
declarations were 631,916 tons, compared with 587,762 tons and
the country earned 130 billion  CFA francs  ($268.3 million) in
taxes during the period, compared with 118 billion francs,
Gbagbo said.  Gbagbo’s rival Alassane Ouattara, the internationally
recognized winner of a Nov. 28 presidential election, ordered
exporters to halt all cocoa and coffee shipments for a month
until Feb. 23 in an attempt to starve Gbagbo’s administration of
funds. He refuses to cede power to Ouattara, alleging voting
fraud in parts of the country’s north.  Ouattara’s call for an export ban risks “having disastrous
consequences on actors of the sector and consumers on both
internal and external levels,” Gbagbo said in his statement
today.  Cocoa for March delivery retreated for the first day in
three, shedding 33 pounds, of 1.5 percent, to 2,158 pounds per
metric ton by 3:20 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
