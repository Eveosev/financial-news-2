  Canada ’s dollar reached the strongest
level since May 2008 as the nation’s economy and employment grew
more than forecast, boosting confidence in the recovery.  The Canadian currency rose the most in two months against
the  U.S. dollar  this week after two straight weekly declines.
The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
waterfowl on the C$1 coin, gained against most of its major
counterparts as oil, the nation’s largest export, reached a two-
year high.  “The strength in the employment number attracted some new
interest to step into the market to sell the U.S. dollar and buy
the Canadian dollar,” said  George Davis , chief technical
analyst for fixed income and currency strategy in Toronto at
Royal  Bank of Canada . “We’re seeing a general buy-North-America
theme and the Canadian dollar has benefited from that.”  The Canadian dollar appreciated 1.4 percent to 98.73 cents
per U.S. dollar in Toronto, from C$1.0013 cents Jan. 28. The
currency yesterday touched 98.32 cents, the strongest level
since May 29, 2008. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0129.  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is known for the image of
the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, has traded above parity with its
U.S. counterpart every day this year, the longest period since
December 2007.  GDP Grows  Canada’s gross domestic product grew at a 3 percent annual
rate in November on increased oil production, wholesaling and
retailing, down from a 3.4 percent pace in October.   Employment rose by 69,200 and the  labor force  increased by
106,400,  Statistics Canada  said yesterday in Ottawa. The jobless
rate rose to 7.8 percent from December’s 7.6 percent. Economists
forecast 7.6 percent unemployment and job growth of 15,000,
according to the median estimates of 25 and 26 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, respectively.  “We had a very solid employment report,” said  Steve Butler , director of foreign-exchange trading in Toronto at Bank
of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit. “The Bank of Canada is
going to have to start thinking about when it’s going to start
hiking rates again.”  The Bank of Canada has left its benchmark interest rate at
1 percent since boosting it for a third consecutive meeting in
September. The bank said Jan. 18 that future increases would be
“carefully” considered.  Market Rates  Credit market prices show investors may be anticipating
higher Canadian policy rates. The yield on the September 2011
bankers’ acceptances contract jumped to 1.74 percent, the
highest since Jan. 21. The yield reached 1.94 percent Jan. 18,
the last meeting of Bank of Canada policy makers.  So-called Bax contracts average about 22 basis points above
the central bank’s overnight target, Bloomberg data since 1992
show.  Hedge funds  and money managers use the contracts to hedge
against interest-rate changes and make bets.  Canada’s employment report restored the nation’s status as
having regained all the jobs it lost in the recession, after a
Jan. 28 revision based on updated census data reduced Statistics
Canada’s estimate of total employment.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 36,000 in January after
a revised increase of 121,000 in the previous month, the Labor
Department reported yesterday in  Washington . The median forecast
of 85 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of
146,000. Unemployment for Canada’s largest trading partner
declined to 9 percent last month from 9.4 percent in December.  Bond Yields    Government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on Canada’s
benchmark two-year note up 16 basis points to 1.83 percent. The
yield is the highest relative to the Bank of Canada target rate
since July. The yield on the 10-year note rose 21 basis points
to 3.46 percent, the highest level since June.  Crude oil for March delivery reached $92.84 Jan. 31, the
highest since October 2008, amid civil unrest in  Egypt  that
raised concern supplies through the  Suez Canal  may be disrupted.
Crude oil is Canada’s largest export.  Metal prices rose after a Feb. 1 report showed Chinese
purchasing managers index compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics rose to 54.5 last month from 54.4.  Copper rose to a record of $4.609 yesterday. Aluminum and
nickel climbed to two-year highs earlier this week. Canada is
the world’s second largest producer of nickel and its third
largest producer of aluminum.  The Canadian dollar gained 1.1 percent this week in a
basket of 10 developed nation currencies, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. It was the biggest gain
after the Australian dollar’s 1.7 percent advance and a 1.3
percent rise in the pound.  To contact the reporter for this story:
