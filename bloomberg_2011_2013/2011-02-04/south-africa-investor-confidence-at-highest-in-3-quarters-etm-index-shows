Investor confidence in  South
Africa  rose to the highest since the first quarter of 2010
in the three months through December, according to an index
that tracks where investors are moving their money.  The Maxim-ETM Investor Confidence Index climbed to
105.4 from a revised 100.1 in the third quarter, George Glynos, managing director of Econometrix Treasury
Management, and analyst  Russell Lamberti  said in an e-
mailed note today.  “The uptick in the latest ICI reading was driven
predominantly by an ongoing recovery in global investor
sentiment, despite another episode of  risk aversion  toward
European sovereign debt,” the analysts said.  The gauge, which started in 2000, was 12 percent
higher than a year earlier.  “Local funds continued to move out of cash, albeit at
a slower pace than in the third quarter, while they also
down-weighted bond allocations for the first time since the
fourth quarter of 2008,” the said. “The obvious
beneficiary was equities as investors up-weighted equities
at the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2009.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
