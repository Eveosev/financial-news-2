In 73 B.C. Spartacus and other slaves
forced to train as gladiators at the Batiatus school got their
hands on some kitchen knives and skewers, overpowered the guards
and fled.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  About 70 made it outside, where they found wagons full of
weapons, quickly defeated the Capuan Home Guard and retreated
into the countryside. At first, the authorities were not overly
worried, sending militia to exterminate the rebels camped on
Mount Vesuvius.  Under siege, Spartacus and his troops, now swelled by other
runaways, made ropes from vines, clambered down the other side
of the volcano, and attacked the Romans from the rear, killing
most of them.  Then they descended on two nearby towns to pillage, burn
and rape.  Romans, who lived in close quarters with their slaves,
quivered as this rebel army gathered momentum.  It took two years to eliminate the threat, and to make a
point, the Romans crucified 6,000 captured slaves along the
Appian Way from  Rome  to Capua.  I spoke with Peter Stothard, author of “ Spartacus Road : A
Journey Through Ancient Italy,” on the following topics:  1. Fight to the Death  2. Display of Combat Tactics  3. Bloody Spectacle  4. Political Tool  5. Emperor’s Show  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .    Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
