Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista ’s
 EBX Group Ltd.  said it’s considering new partnerships with  SK
Group  after  South Korea ’s third-largest industrial group bought
a stake in his mining unit for $700 million last year.  SK Chairman Chey Tae Won traveled to  Brazil  this week to
analyze new business between the two groups, EBX said in an e-
mailed statement. Chey visited some of Batista’s projects in the
Latin American country and met with executives of his oil,
energy, logistics and real-estate businesses, EBX said.  “The South Korean executives are studying potential new
business with the group, particularly in the infrastructure and
natural resources sectors,” EBX said late yesterday in the
statement.  SK said this month it plans to boost spending this year by
31 percent to a record $9.4 billion and increase hiring by 25
percent. It  agreed  to pay $700 million through its subsidiary SK
Networks Co. to buy a stake in MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA in
September, becoming the third-largest shareholder of Batista’s
mining business unit.  In December, the Korean conglomerate sold its Brazilian oil
subsidiary SK do Brasil Ltda. to Maersk Oil, a unit of A.P.
Moeller-Maersk A/S, for $2.4 billion.  In his trip to Brazil, SK’s Chey went to MMX’s Serra Azul
iron-ore project in the Minas Gerais State, EBX said. He also
visited Porto Acu, a port Batista’s LLX Logistica SA is
developing to export the mineral from Brazil in partnership with
Anglo American Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
