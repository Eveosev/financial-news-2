Uganda is seeking international firms
to construct a 230-kilometer oil pipeline from a planned
refinery in the Lake Albert region to the capital, Kampala, the
Daily Monitor reported, citing Minister of State for Energy
Simon D’Ujanga.  Tenders for the pipeline will be issued to pre-qualified
firms next month, the Kampala-based newspaper reported today,
citing D’Ujanga. The project is part of a regional pipeline
which will eventually be extended to  Kenya ’s coastal city of
Mombasa, eastern Congo,  Rwanda  and Burundi, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
