The rand retreated for a third day
against the dollar, extending a fifth straight weekly decline,
as clashes in Egypt curbed investors’ demand for risk.    South Africa ’s currency lost as much as 0.5 percent to
7.2991 per dollar and traded 0.2 weaker at 7.2881 as of 12:21
p.m. in Johannesburg, for a drop of 1.5 percent in the past five
days. Against the euro, the rand slid 0.1 percent to 9.94,
increasing its depreciation this week to a 1.7 percent.  Outflows from emerging-market equity mutual funds reached
$7 billion in the week ended Feb. 2 as protests in Egypt
intensified against  Hosni Mubarak , who has ruled as president
for almost 30 years, according to UralSib Financial Corp. At
least 13 people died in the skirmishes in the past two days.  “The events unfolding in  Egypt  have been underestimated as
a potential source of volatility,” Tradition Analytics analysts
led by Quinten Bertenshaw in Johannesburg wrote in a client
note. Egyptian unrest is “being utilized as the justification
for heightened risk aversion and rotation away from the rand.”  The rand has lost 9.9 percent against the dollar so far in
2011 after a 42 percent surge the previous two years, largely
propelled by the allure of South African yields as the U.S. and
Europe dropped their benchmark borrowing costs to 0.25 percent
and 1 percent, respectively.  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis has
also damped demand for the higher-risk, higher-yield profile of
developing-nation assets this year, while moves by  China  to curb
inflation have fueled concern global growth may slow.  South African  government bonds  were little changed, with
the yield on the 13.5 percent security  due September 2015
steady at 7.94 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
