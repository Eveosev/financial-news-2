India’s power ministry proposes to
include banks in a planned $11 billion fund that will allow
subsidized loans to be offered to state distribution companies
expanding  India ’s electricity grid.  The aim is to allow banks to join state-owned power project
lenders in funding grid expansion projects, P. Uma Shankar, the
country’s power secretary, said in an interview late yesterday.  India is upgrading and expanding its power networks to help
limit losses and prepare for the planned addition of 100,000
megawatts of capacity in the five years ending March 2017.
Transmission and distribution losses in  Asia ’s second-fastest
growing major economy may rise to 1 trillion rupees ($22
billion) annually by March 2015 from 600 billion rupees last
year, according to India’s finance ministry.  Approval for the National Electricity Fund to be formed by
state-owned lenders Power Finance Corp. and Rural
Electrification Corp. is expected by March 31, B.K. Chaturvedi,
a member of India’s Planning Commission, said Jan. 10. The
government will help cut the borrowing costs of Power Finance
and Rural Electrification by 3 to 5 percentage points on loans
raised for the fund, he said.  “The government will be taking on a large portion of the
cost of the loan,” Shankar said.  India proposed setting up a national fund for transmission
and distribution reform in the 2008-09 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
