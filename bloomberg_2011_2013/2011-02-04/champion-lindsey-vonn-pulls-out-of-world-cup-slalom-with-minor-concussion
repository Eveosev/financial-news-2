Olympic downhill champion  Lindsey Vonn  withdrew from today’s  World Cup  slalom race in Arber-
Zwiesel,  Germany , after sustaining a concussion in training
earlier this week.  Vonn “received a minor concussion in the crash, but her
condition has improved and she was medically cleared to race,”
Doug Haney, a press officer at the  U.S. Ski and Snowboard
Association , said in an e-mail. “She opted not to race today in
order to gain one more day of rest,” he added.  “I am obviously very frustrated and upset because normally
I can fight through injuries, but head injuries are different,
you can’t just grit your teeth and go,” Vonn said on her
 Facebook page  today. “They need time, and you don’t know how
long it will take.”  The American crashed two days ago during a training giant-
slalom run in Hinterreit,  Austria . She was taken to the hospital
for a scan that showed no major injuries.  A video posted on her Facebook page showed Vonn losing her
balance on a gate, falling down the slope on her back and then
lying motionless.  Vonn is the defending super-G and downhill champion at next
week’s  FIS alpine ski world championships  in Garmisch-
Partenkirchen, Germany. The women’s super-G is scheduled for
Feb. 8 and the women’s downhill for Feb. 13.  Vonn is trailing Germany’s Maria Riesch in the overall
standings for the  World Cup . Riesch crashed out in the first leg
of the race today amid foggy conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
