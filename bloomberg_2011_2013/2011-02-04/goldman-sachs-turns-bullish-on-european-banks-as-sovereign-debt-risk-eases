  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . turned
bullish on European banks for the first time since September
2009 as concern about the region’s sovereign-debt crisis eased
and the industry remained among the cheapest.  The U.S. bank that makes the most revenue from trading
advised investors to take an “overweight” position on banks,
raising its previous “neutral” recommendation, according to a
group of equity strategists led Peter Oppenheimer. Investors
should pay for the trade by lowering holdings of consumer
shares, he wrote.  “For financials the narrowing of sovereign spreads in
peripheral eurozone, which our economists expect to continue, is
a clear positive,” London-based Oppenheimer wrote in the report
dated Feb. 3. “Banks are one of the least expensive sectors in
the market and the trade-off between their growth prospects and
earnings in the next few years looks especially attractive.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index, a regional benchmark, has
rallied 23 percent since a low in May 2010 amid optimism that
the  U.S. economy  is strengthening and as European governments
implemented policies to support indebted countries using the
single currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
