Chicago  gasoline weakened for a fifth
day as Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s Lemont refinery in Illinois
release emissions during a process startup.  The 170,500-barrel-a-day plant released an unknown amount
of sulfur dioxide during the event, a filing with the National
Response Center showed. Citgo shut a fluid catalytic cracker at
the refinery last month and expected to finish the work within
the first week of August, the company said in a July 30
statement.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
fell 0.5 cent to 9.5 cents a gallon versus futures traded on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:24 p.m., Bloomberg data
showed. It’s the lowest level since July 6. Prompt delivery
slipped 1.69 cents to $3.0744 a gallon.  Gasoline inventories in the Padd 2 region dropped 257,000
barrels, or 0.5 percent, to 49.6 million barrels, according to
the Energy Department.  The same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3, dropped 2.75
cents to a premium of 2.5 cents a gallon. It is the lowest level
since July 10.  HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  said its Tulsa refinery has cut crude
processing rates by 30,000 to 40,000 barrels a day while repairs
that may last eight weeks are under way on a diesel
hydrotreater.  The refinery has also shut a 65,000-barrel-a-day crude unit
in the East portion of the plant, David Lamp, the company’s
chief operating officer, said during a conference call with
investors today.  Regular 87-octane gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  dropped 1.5
cents to a discount versus futures of 10.25 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
