The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.2 percent to 658.72 at 5:08 p.m. in  New
York . The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials was up
0.1 percent at 1,572.522.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures dropped in New York for the first time
in three days on concern that a supply glut will worsen once the
summer cooling season ends.  Gas fell 1.1 percent before a government report tomorrow
that may show U.S.  stockpiles  rose by 30 billion cubic feet last
week, below the five-year average gain of 45 billion for the
week, based on  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Gas is
up 54 percent since sliding to a decade low in April as hotter-
than-normal weather helped drive down a supply surplus.  Natural gas for September delivery slid 3.1 cents to settle
at $2.933 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures are down 1.9 percent this year.  CRUDE OIL  Oil in New York fell for the first time in four days after
a government report showed fuel demand weakened last week and on
concern that the  Federal Reserve  won’t implement additional
stimulus measures.  Prices declined 0.3 percent as the Energy Department said
U.S. petroleum demand decreased for the first time in four
weeks. The report also showed oil supplies dropped less than in
an  American Petroleum Institute  reported yesterday. Dallas Fed
President  Richard Fisher  said central banks may not have the
capacity to undertake more stimulus.  Crude oil for September delivery fell 32 cents to settle at
$93.35 a barrel on the Nymex after increasing to $94.72, the
highest intraday level since May 15. Prices have fallen 5.5
percent this year.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil advanced to a three-month high as U.S.
inventories of distillate fuels declined and demand climbed to
the highest level in five weeks.  Heating oil for September delivery rose 1.79 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.0159 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest
settlement since May 3. The September contract has gained 6.1
percent in four days of advances.  Gasoline for September delivery fell 1.09 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $2.9804 a gallon on the Nymex.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Raw-sugar futures fell, capping the longest slide in more
than three years as favorable weather for crops in Brazil and
 India , the world’s top producers, improved supply prospects.  Raw-sugar for October delivery fell 1.5 percent to settle
at 21.09 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. That
marked the seventh straight drop, the longest decline since
March 30, 2009.  Cocoa for December delivery advanced 0.8 percent to settle
at $2,469 a metric ton. Earlier, the commodity reached $2,481,
the highest level for a most-active contract since Nov. 18.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery dropped 1.2
percent to $1.705 a pound.  BASE METALS  Copper fell for the first time in four sessions after
weaker-than-forecast German industrial production fueled concern
that  Europe ’s debt crisis is crimping economies and cutting
metals demand.  Copper futures for September delivery slid 0.6 percent to
settle at $3.4215 a pound on the Comex in New York. Prices
gained 4.6 percent in the previous three sessions.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months retreated 0.4 percent to $7,550 a metric ton ($3.43 a
pound.)  Nickel, zinc and tin also dropped, while aluminum and lead
gained in London.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold advanced for the third time in four sessions on
speculation that central banks will take steps to bolster their
economies, increasing the appeal of the precious metal as a
store of value.  Gold futures for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,616 an ounce on the Comex. The price has climbed
1.6 percent since Aug. 2.  Silver futures for September delivery declined less than
0.1 percent to $28.075 an ounce in New York.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle gained for the first time in four sessions as the
number of animals available for meatpacking plants is declining
amid strong demand for U.S. beef. Hogs also rose.  Cattle futures for October delivery increased 1.2 percent
to settle at $1.25675 a pound on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange. Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement rose 0.9
percent to $1.4145 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for October settlement climbed 0.9 percent to
75.625 cents a pound in Chicago, the first gain for the most-
active contract in seven sessions.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn rose for the first time this week on signs of
increased demand for the grain to produce ethanol to blend with
gasoline. Soybeans gained before the government releases
production forecasts.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 2 percent to close
at $8.165 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, heading for
the first gain this week. The most-active contract touched a
record $8.205 on July 31 as hot, dry weather stressed U.S.
crops.  Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 1 percent
$15.8125 a bushel in Chicago. On July 23, the price reached
$16.915, the highest ever.  To contact the reporter on this story:
