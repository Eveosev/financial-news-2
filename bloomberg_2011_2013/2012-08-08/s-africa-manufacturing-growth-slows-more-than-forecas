South African  manufacturing  growth
slowed more than economists forecast in June as a global
economic slowdown damped demand for exports, threatening the
expansion in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  Factory production, which makes up 15 percent of the
economy, rose 0.8 percent from a year earlier after advancing a
revised 4.4 percent in May, Pretoria-based Statistics  South
Africa  said on its website today. The  median estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey of eight economists was for growth of 3
percent. Output declined 2.4 percent from a month earlier.  “Production activity appears to have softened in recent
months, reflecting the slowdown in the global economy,
especially within the euro-area,”  Kevin Lings , an economist at
Stanlib Asset Management in Johannesburg, said in a note to
clients. “For 2012, we expect manufacturing growth to average
less than 1.5 percent, which is certainly very disappointing.”  The central bank last month lowered its benchmark  lending
rate  for the first time since 2010, reducing it by half a
percentage point to 5 percent to bolster the economy as  Europe ’s
debt crisis curbs export demand. The government is forecasting
economic growth this year of 2.7 percent, which would be the
slowest pace since a recession in 2009.  The rand was little changed at 8.2065 against the dollar as
of 2:40 p.m. in Johannesburg compared with before the data was
released. The yield on the R157 government bond, due 2015, rose
2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage points, to 5.59 percent.  “The manufacturing sector remains susceptible to renewed
weakness in the global economy, particularly in the euro area,
through possible declines in exports,” the Pretoria-based
 Reserve Bank  said on July 23 in its annual economic report.  South Africa’s seasonally adjusted  purchasing managers
index  rebounded in July to 51 from a 10-month low of 48.2 in
June, as factory orders remained steady, Kagiso Tiso Holdings
Ltd. said on Aug. 1. An index level above 50 indicates an
expansion in factory output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
