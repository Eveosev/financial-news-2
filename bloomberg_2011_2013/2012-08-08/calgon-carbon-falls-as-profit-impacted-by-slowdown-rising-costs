Calgon Carbon Corp. (CCC) , a Pittsburgh-
based water-purification company, said second-quarter profit
fell almost 4 percent, hurt by the economic slowdown and rising
costs of raw materials.  The shares slid as much as 9.6 percent, the most since
2009, after Calgon Carbon reported net income of $10.9 million,
down from $11.3 million for the year-earlier period. The stock
has fallen 14 percent this year compared with a 13 percent gain
by the 17-member Bloomberg World Water Index.  Calgon Carbon reported quarterly earnings per share of 19
cents today versus analysts’ 20 cents per share estimate. Net
sales of $148.4 million were almost 10 percent higher than the
year-earlier quarter, the company said today in a statement.  Equipment sales climbed 70 percent from the year-earlier
period, aided by “higher revenue recognition from ballast water
treatment systems,” Calgon Carbon said. No quarterly dividend
was declared and a cost-reduction program is being implemented,
it said.  “Several factors, including the global economic slowdown,
rising raw material and maintenance costs, and delays in
implementation of environmental regulations have created a
challenging business environment,” Calgon Carbon Chief
Executive Officer Randy Dearth said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
