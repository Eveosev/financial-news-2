The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose
for a fourth day as commodities rebounded and  Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) 
Co. paced gains in technology shares after boosting its
forecast, helping the market recoup early losses. Treasuries
fell as a 10-year note sale drew the weakest demand since 2009.  The  S&P 500  rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,402.22 at 4
p.m. in  New York , erasing a loss of as much as 0.4 percent and
closing at a three-month high. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained
0.2 percent after dropping 0.7 percent. Ten-year Treasury note
rates climbed to a five-week high following the $24 billion
auction. Oil slipped after U.S. Energy Department data showed
weakening fuel demand, while corn and cattle jumped more than 1
percent to lead commodities higher.  Hewlett-Packard jumped 2.4 percent to lead the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  up 7 points to 13,175.64, the highest level
since May 3, after boosting its profit outlook and announcing a
restructuring of its ailing enterprise-services division. U.S.
equities followed European shares lower in early trading after
German exports dropped 1.5 percent in June from the previous
month and industrial production decreased, while Dallas Federal
Reserve Bank President  Richard Fisher  said global central banks
may not have the capacity to provide more stimulus.  “The corporate side looks pretty good still,” Rick Fier,
director of equity trading at Conifer Securities LLC in New
York, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $12
billion in assets. “Earnings are done for the most part. Now
people are scratching their heads. The market has fallen into a
bit of a buy-the-dip mentality at this point.”  Above 1,389  The S&P 500 has rebounded almost 10 percent from a five-
month low on June 1. The  rally  brought the index almost 1
percent above 1,389, which is the average year-end forecast
among Wall Street strategists.  Equities opened the session lower as the remarks from the
Fed’s Fisher damped speculation of further monetary easing. The
S&P 500 rose yesterday as Fed Bank of Boston President  Eric Rosengren  said the central bank should pursue an “open-ended”
easing program of “substantial magnitude.”  U.S. stocks are in a “make-or-break situation” that will
probably lead to either large gains or losses, according to
technical analysts at UBS AG. After climbing through the 1,390
level, the S&P 500 may go on to test the highs reached in March
and May, Michael Riesner and Marc Mueller in Zurich wrote in a
report dated yesterday. A drop below 1,325 would indicate a
retreat to the early-June low of 1,266. That would be an almost
10 percent slide.  Market Leaders  Consumer-staples providers, commodity producers and
technology shares led gains among the 10 main groups in the S&P
500, while consumer-discretionary, industrial and financial
companies declined.  Dean Foods Co. (DF)  surged 41 percent today, the most since it
went public in 1996, as its WhiteWave unit filed to raise $300
million in a U.S. initial public offering.  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the
largest restaurant chain, retreated 1.7 after global sales were
unchanged in July. Priceline.com Inc., the biggest U.S. online
travel agency by market value, tumbled 17 percent after
forecasting earnings that missed projections.  About three stocks dropped for every two that advanced in
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Of the 229 companies in the  equity
benchmark  that have reported second-quarter earnings, half have
fallen short of the average analyst estimate for net income.  ING Groep NV slid 1.3 percent after the Dutch bank reported
a 22 percent decline in profit. Securitas AB tumbled 8.8
percent, the most in a year, after the security company said
sales growth was weak. Rio Tinto Group advanced 2.9 percent as
 the world’s third-biggest mining company  reported first-half
profit of $5.9 billion, more than the average estimate of $5.04
billion.  Treasury Auction  The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose two basis
points to 1.65 percent. The notes auctioned today drew a yield
of 1.680 percent, compared with a forecast of 1.656 percent in a
survey of 10 of the Fed’s primary dealers. The bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of securities offered, was 2.49 compared with 3.61 in
July and an average of 3.1 for the previous 10 sales.  Treasuries rose earlier amid concern  Greece  will need more
support from European Union leaders after S&P cut the nation’s
credit-rating outlook.  The euro depreciated 0.5 percent against the yen, while
 Japan ’s currency strengthened 0.1 percent versus the dollar. The
pound rebounded, gaining 0.2 percent against the dollar, after
 Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  said a rate cut might be
counterproductive.  German Rates  The yield on the two-year German note declined two basis
points to minus 0.052 percent, below zero for the 24th
consecutive day. The government sold 3.4 billion euros ($4.2
billion) of 10-year bunds today at an average yield of 1.42
percent, up from 1.31 percent at the previous auction.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments climbed 1.5 basis points to 249
with contracts on  Spain  rising for the first time in four days.  The S&P GSCI Index added 0.2 percent as 15 of its 24
commodities advanced. Cattle gained for the first time in four
sessions, rising 1.2 percent to $1.25675 a pound, as the number
of animals available for meatpacking plants is declining amid
strong demand for U.S. beef. Hogs climbed 0.9 percent.  Corn rose for the first time this week on signs of
increased demand for the grain to produce ethanol to blend with
gasoline. Soybeans gained before the government releases
production forecasts. Ethanol production in the U.S. rose 1
percent last week to 817,000 barrels a day, Energy Department
data showed.  Oil slipped 0.3 percent to $93.35 a barrel after climbing
as much as 1.1 percent. The Energy Department said U.S.
petroleum demand decreased for the first time in four weeks. The
report also showed oil supplies dropped less than in an  American
Petroleum Institute  reported yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
