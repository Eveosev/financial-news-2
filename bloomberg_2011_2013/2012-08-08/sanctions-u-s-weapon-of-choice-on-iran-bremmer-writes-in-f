Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  has learned a
hard lesson: the U.S.’s main weapon against Iran is sanctions,
 Ian Bremmer  wrote in the Financial Times.  Sanctions “are not simply the opening act to a more-
dangerous moment;” they are “the headline risk,” Bremmer,
president of the Eurasia Group, writes.  The potential costs of an airstrike against the country are
high, meaning that other strategies, especially sanctions, will
be given time to work, Bremmer writes.  It will be economic and financial strictures rather than
military action that will decide “whether Iran crosses the
nuclear threshold,” he writes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
