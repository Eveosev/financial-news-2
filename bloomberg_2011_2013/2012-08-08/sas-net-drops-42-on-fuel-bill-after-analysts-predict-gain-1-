SAS Group (SAS) , the Nordic region’s
largest airline, said it will deepen job cuts after higher fuel
costs and sluggish European economies caused second-quarter
profit to tumble 42 percent, missing analyst estimates.  Net income fell to 320 million kronor ($47.5 million) from
551 million kronor a year earlier, the Scandinavian Airlines
parent said in a statement. Analysts had estimated profit would
increase to 565 million kronor, based on four  estimates .  SAS, which faces competition from Norwegian Air Shuttle
ASA, is scrapping 300 office jobs and will cut more as it seeks
a first annual  profit  since 2007, Chief Executive Officer
Rickard Gustafson said in an interview. While the Stockholm-
based company’s quarterly sales rose 0.6 percent to 11.4 billion
kronor, the fuel bill jumped 39 percent 784 million kronor.  “Delivering productivity gains and cost savings will create
redundancies that must be taken out,” Gustafson said at Arlanda
airport, close to the company’s headquarters. “The industry is
struggling with fuel prices and profitability, so it’s difficult
to compensate for that with fare increases.”  Shares of SAS fell 9.2 percent, the biggest drop since May
3, before trading unchanged at 5.95 kronor as of 11:47 a.m. in
 Stockholm . They’re down 26 percent this year, valuing the
company at 1.96 billion kronor. The seven-member Bloomberg EMEA
Airlines Index, of which SAS isn’t a member, is up 8.6 percent.  Jet-fuel price fell slightly in the second quarter, only to
increase again last month, and constitute “a major challenge”
for the industry according to Gustafson. The company’s 35 unions
have agreed to a salary freeze through 2013, he said.  “Passenger revenue isn’t increasing, while fuel costs
are,” said  Jacob Pedersen , an analyst at Sydbank A/S in
Aabenraa,  Denmark , with an “underweight” rating on SAS.
“That’s a massive problem. The challenge is to continue to cut
costs while getting revenues up.”  SAS, part-owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and
 Norway , aims to cut costs by as much as 5 percent and boost
earnings by 5 billion kronor in 2012 and 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
