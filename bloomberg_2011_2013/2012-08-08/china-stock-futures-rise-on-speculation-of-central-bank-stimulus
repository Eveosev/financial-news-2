Most Chinese  stocks  fell before the
release of industrial production and inflation data tomorrow as
speculation mounted the government will take steps to support
equities.  Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co. (600518)  and  Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858)  dropped
at least 1.5 percent, leading declines by health-care and
consumer-staple companies, the  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) ’s best performers
in the past six months. Hong  Yuan  Securities Co. climbed 1.8
percent, pacing gains among brokerages, after the Securities
Times reported funding for margin trading may be expanded.
 Xiamen Tungsten Co. (600549)  jumped 10 percent after saying it will
accelerate the development of its rare-earth business.  Two stocks declined for each one that rose in the  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which advanced 0.2 percent to 2,160.99 at the
close today. The gauge turned between gains and losses at least
17 times today. Data tomorrow will probably show industrial
production rose 9.7 percent last month from a year earlier,
compared with June’s 9.5 percent increase, according to an
economist survey by Bloomberg News. Consumer inflation probably
decelerated to 1.7 percent in July, the weakest pace since
January 2010.  “Investors are more cautious before the data,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West  China  Securities Co. in Shanghai.
“There’s still a lack of confidence in the market, something
that we cannot reverse until there’s a major catalyst for the
economy to rise.”  Speculation global central banks will take steps to boost
economic growth mounted after Federal  Reserve Bank  of Boston
President  Eric Rosengren  said yesterday the institution should
pursue an “open-ended” easing program of “substantial
magnitude.” German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  on Aug. 6 backed
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s bond-buying plan.  Volatility  The CSI 300 Index added less than 0.1 percent to 2,389.79.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  advanced 0.1 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US
55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, added 1.6 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai index was at 14.1.
Trading  volumes  of shares in the gauge were 26 percent higher
than the average in the past 10 days, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The Shanghai Composite has tumbled 12 percent from this
year’s high on March 2 amid concern the economic slowdown is
deepening. The index is valued at 9.6 times  estimated profit ,
compared with the three-year average of 17.3, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Expensive Valuations  A gauge of health-care stocks in the CSI 300 lost 1.5
percent, while the measure of consumer staples dropped 0.5
percent. The two sub-indexes climbed at least 9.8 percent in the
past six months, the only advances among the CSI 300’s 10
industry groups.  Kangmei Pharmaceutical, a medicine producer, declined 4.2
percent to 15.12 yuan, the most since April 26.  Guangxi Wuzhou
Zhongheng Group Co. (600252) , a Chinese medicine maker, retreated 3.8
percent to 11.77 yuan. Valuations for health-care stocks are
expensive compared to other shares after the recent surge, said
 Li Ying , analyst at Capital Securities Corp. by telephone. The
CSI 300 trades for 10.5 times estimated profit, about half the
health-care index’s 20.8 multiple.  The CSI 300’s consumer-staples measure is valued at 18.6
times earnings. Wuliangye Yibin Co., China’s second-largest
maker of white liquor by market value, dropped 1.5 percent to
36.05 yuan.  Chongqing Brewery Co. (600132) , part-owned by Carlsberg A/S,
lost 1.4 percent to 18.89 yuan. Yonghui Superstores Co., a
supermarket operator in the southeast province of Fujian,
retreated 2.2 percent to 22.20 yuan.  Margin Trading  Hong Yuan rose 1.8 percent to 19.12 yuan, while  Haitong
Securities Co. (600837)  advanced 0.3 percent to 9.84 yuan. Guoyuan
Securities Co. jumped 2.5 percent to 11.34 yuan.  China Securities Finance Corp. increased its registered
capital to 12 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) from 7.5 billion yuan,
enabling it to lend as much as 120 billion yuan to domestic
brokerages for margin trading and short-selling services, the
 Securities Times  reported today, citing an unidentified
official. More than 10 brokerages may start margin trading and
short-selling services under a trial program, it said.  Chinese publicly traded companies are required to release
first-half earnings results in July and August. Of the 886
companies in the Shanghai Composite, the 132 that reported
second-quarter earnings had an average 1.4 percent profit
decline, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Profit rose
2.8 percent in the first quarter, the data showed.  ‘High Expectations’  The People’s Bank of China has cut  interest rates  twice
since early June and lowered lenders’ reserve requirements as
the world’s second-largest economy seeks to stem the slowest
growth in three years.  “Tomorrow’s data would probably show economic growth has
stabilized but hasn’t picked up yet,’ said Wang Weijun, a
strategist at Zheshang Securities Co. in  Shanghai . ‘‘Investors
have high expectations that the government will do something to
support the market such as a cut in the reserve requirement
ratio or suspension of new share sales.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., rose 0.6 percent to $35.19
yesterday, its third day of gains.  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from Leon Lazaroff in New York.
