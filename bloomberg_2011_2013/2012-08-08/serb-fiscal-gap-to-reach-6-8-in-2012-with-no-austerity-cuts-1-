Serbia’s fiscal deficit will reach
6.8 percent of gross domestic product this year if the
government does nothing to implement savings, the  Finance
Ministry  said.  The gap would reach 225 billion dinars, it estimated. For
next year, the shortfall may rise to 7.7 percent of GDP, or
254.8 billion dinars, if assistance for troubled banks is
included, the ministry said in a statement handed out to
reporters today in Belgrade.  The country’s public debt stood at 15.3 billion euros,
Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said at the conference
discussing the new government’s fiscal plans. That amounts to
53.4 percent of GDP at the end of June, according to ministry
accounting, and 55 percent by central bank methodology.  The new government will lower the public debt level with
deficit cuts, he said. The state will pay 3.67 billion euros to
service its public debt and Dinkic said he is “certain” the
nation will lower its financing needs to below 4 billion euros
in 2013 from this year’s 4.4 billion euros and below 3 percent
in 2014.  On taxes, Dinkic said any tax increase won’t take the
value-added  tax rate , now at 18 percent, above 20 percent. VAT
on food and other staples will remain at 8 percent, Dinkic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
