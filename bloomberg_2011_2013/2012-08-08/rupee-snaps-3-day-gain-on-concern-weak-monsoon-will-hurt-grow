India ’s rupee fell, snapping a three-
day advance, on concern deficient seasonal rainfall will curb
farm output and hurt  Asia ’s third-largest economy.  India’s monsoon, which accounts for more than 70 percent of
annual rains, was 17 percent below a 50-year average, the
nation’s weather bureau said yesterday. Citigroup Inc. lowered
its estimate for India’s growth in the fiscal year through March
2013 to 5.4 percent from 6.4 percent, and expects the pace will
slow to 4.9 percent should weather conditions worsen, according
to a report published today.  “The drought could lead to some near-term weakness” in
the economy, said Nick Verdi, a strategist in  Singapore  at the
investment banking unit of Barclays Plc. “This could affect
inflows” of foreign capital, he said.  The rupee declined 0.6 percent to 55.4150 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, rose five basis point, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 10.40 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.28 per
dollar, compared with 56.13 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.19 from 56.04. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
