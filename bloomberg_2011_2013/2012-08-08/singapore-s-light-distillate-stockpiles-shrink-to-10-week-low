Singapore ’s stockpiles of light
distillates fell to the lowest level in 10 weeks, according to
data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  light distillates  such as naphtha,
reformate and gasoline, dropped 10 percent to 9.27 million
barrels in the week ended Aug. 7,  International Enterprise
Singapore , a unit of the ministry, said in a statement today.
Supplies are at the lowest since the week ended May 30.  Stockpiles of  residues , a category that includes  fuel oil 
and low sulfur waxy residue, and excludes bitumen, rose 7.3
percent to 21.3 million barrels.  Middle distillates , such as
gasoil and kerosene, increased 8.8 percent to 9.66 million
barrels, the highest level in 12 weeks.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
