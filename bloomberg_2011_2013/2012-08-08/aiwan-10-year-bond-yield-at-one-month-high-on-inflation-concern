Taiwan ’s government bonds gained and
the local dollar weakened after data showed exports dropped for
a fifth month, fueling concern the economy is weakening and
boosting demand for safer assets.  Shipments slumped 11.6 percent in July from a year earlier,
the biggest drop since January, official data showed yesterday.
The statistics bureau cut its 2012 export-growth estimate to
0.07 percent last month from a 2.69 percent gain estimated in
May. Taiwan’s neighbor, South Korea, is set to consider cutting
 interest rates  for a second straight month tomorrow, with six
out of 16 economists expecting a reduction, according to a
survey by Bloomberg News.  “Taiwan’s export situation is very alarming,” said  James Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “That
will be a strong force countering any increase in yields.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due March 2022 fell one
basis point, the biggest drop in a week, to 1.17 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  Taiex (TWSE)  index of shares rose for a third day on
speculation central banks from the U.S. to China will take steps
to boost growth. Global funds bought $172 million more local
stocks than they sold today, after net purchases of $673 million
in the last two days, according to exchange data.  The  Taiwan dollar  slipped 0.1 percent to NT$29.987 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
a one-month high of NT$29.830 earlier. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to
3.70 percent.  The  overnight money-market rate  was little changed at 0.388
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
