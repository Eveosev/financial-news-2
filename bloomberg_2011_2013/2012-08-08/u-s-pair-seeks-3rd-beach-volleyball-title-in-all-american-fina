Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings will go for their third straight women’s beach
volleyball Olympic title in today’s all-American final.  The U.S. pair beat Xue Chen and Zhang Xi of  China , the
bronze medalists in 2008 in Beijing, 22-20, 22-20, in front of
11,000 spectators yesterday at Horse Guards Parade in  London  to
secure their 20th straight victory at the Olympics.  They’ll defend their title against U.S. teammates April
Ross and Jen Kessy, who beat top-seeded Brazilians Juliana
Felisberta Silva and Larissa Franca, 15-21, 21-19, 15-12 in the
other semifinal.  “We have a huge match,” Walsh Jennings, 33, told
reporters. “We have a goal we want to accomplish, after that I
am going to be a wreck.”  May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings, who won consecutive world
championships in 2003, 2005 and 2007, dropped their first
Olympic set last week in a 2-1 win against  Austria  in pool play.
Yesterday, the team didn’t hold its first lead until 17-16 in
the first set, but rode a late 4-1 run to take a one-set lead.  The U.S. pair trailed 20-19 in the second set before
winning the final three points to secure a spot in the final.  “I had a picture in my head at the beginning of the season
of how I wanted us to play,” said 35-year-old May-Treanor, who
plans to retire after these games. “We’re living that picture,
but it’s not over yet.”  Ross and Kessy lost the first set and trailed 14-11 in the
second set of their semifinal against the 2011 world champions
from  Brazil . They rallied to win the set and never trailed in
the decider.  “Now I am going to start dreaming about gold,” Ross, 30,
said. “We expect to win, we hope to win.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
