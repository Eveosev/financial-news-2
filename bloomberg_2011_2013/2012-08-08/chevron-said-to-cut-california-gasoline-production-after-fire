Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Richmond  refinery ,
the largest in northern  California , is running a gasoline-making
unit at about 60 percent capacity following an Aug. 6 fire that
shut the crude unit, a person familiar with production said.  The 240,000-barrel-a-day plant is operating the fluid
catalytic cracker, which processes vacuum gasoil into gasoline
and lighter products, off of feedstock stored in tanks, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public. The refinery is also running one of two units at
an Isomax hydrocracking complex at 60 percent capacity and the
lube plant at low rates, the person said.  The blaze, which brought down the crude unit indefinitely,
sent gasoline in San Francisco up 29.5 cents to 35 cents a
gallon above futures traded in  New York  yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg shows. That was the highest level in almost three
months and the largest single-day increase since at least
November 2007.  Melissa Ritchie, a Chevron spokeswoman at the refinery,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.
She said in an e-mail today that the  San Ramon , California-based
company was working to repair “affected equipment.”  The refinery extinguished a second fire at the plant that
ignited at about 11:30 a.m. local time near the site of the Aug.
6 blaze, Ritchie said in a separate e-mail. Nobody was injured,
and the fire was put out within minutes, she said.  The refinery is still performing a “controlled burn” of
fuel from the original fire, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
