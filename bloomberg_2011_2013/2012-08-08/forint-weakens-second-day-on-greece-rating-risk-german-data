Hungary ’s forint weakened a second
day amid concern Greece’s credit rating may be cut and as German
industrial output contracted, cutting investor appetite for
riskier, emerging-market assets.  The currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 277.49 per euro by
4:36 p.m. in Budapest. The yield on  government bonds  maturing in
2022 rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.499
percent.  Greece may be cut again by Standard & Poor’s after the
rating agency revised to negative the outlook on the country’s
CCC ranking, already eight levels below investment grade. German
 factory output  fell 0.9 percent from May, the third set of data
this week to signal Europe’s largest economy is cooling as the
sovereign debt crisis erodes demand for its goods.  Germany  is
Hungary’s largest trading partner.  Developments in the euro area will be “decisive for the
forint” today amid the intensifying risk aversion, Commerzbank
AG analysts led by Peter Karsai in Budapest said in an e-mailed
note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
