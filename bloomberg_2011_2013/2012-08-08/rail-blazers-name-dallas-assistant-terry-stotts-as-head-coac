Terry Stotts was chosen as the 14th
head coach of the  National Basketball Association ’s Portland
Trail Blazers.  Stotts, 54, heads to Oregon after four seasons as an
assistant with the  Dallas Mavericks . He succeeds Nate McMillan,
who was fired a day after Portland lost by 42 points to the  New
York Knicks  in March.  “Terry is one of the elite offensive minds in the NBA, has
extensive experience with multiple organizations and was
instrumental in the Dallas Mavericks winning the 2011 NBA
championship,” Trail Blazers General Manager Neil Olshey said
yesterday on the team’s website.  Stotts has a 115-168 record as a head coach following
stints with the Atlanta Hawks from 2002-04 and the Milwaukee
Bucks from 2005-07.  Portland assistant Kaleb Canales took over the team after
McMillan, 47, was fired.  The Trail Blazers ended the 2011-12 season in fourth place
in the Western Conference’s five-team Northwest Division with a
28-38 record, 19 games behind the Oklahoma City Thunder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
