Demand for white, or refined, sugar
isn’t very strong, according to  Al Khaleej  Sugar Co., owner of
the world’s biggest sugar refinery in Dubai.  While the price of raw sugar traded in New York climbed 7.8
percent last month on concern about supplies from top producers
Brazil and  India , white sugar traded in  London  rose 0.9 percent.
Demand for the variety slowed as Ramadan started in July. Muslim
nations usually stockpile the sweetener before the fasting
month.  “We do not see a very strong demand,” for white sugar,
Cyrus Raja, the company’s general manager, said by phone today.
“We are not continuously operating at full capacity, but we are
continuously producing. We’ve had no shutdowns.”  Al Khaleej usually buys the sweetener from  Brazil  to
process into the white variety. The refiner hasn’t made any
purchases of raw sugar lately, Raja said. Some 98,250 metric
tons of the raw variety were scheduled to be shipped to the
United Arab Emirates from ports in the center south, Brazil’s
main growing region, according to data from shipping agency
Unimar Agenciamentos Maritimos Ltda. in Santos.  “For the moment, we have not done any new buying,” Raja
said. Vessels lining up for Brazilian ports are based on “our
earlier buying, under long-term contracts,” he said.  White sugar for October delivery was little changed at
$597.90 a ton by 1:35 p.m. on the NYSE Liffe exchange in London.
Raw sugar for October delivery gained 0.2 percent to 21.47 cents
a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
