Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened for a
second day on concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and damp
demand for the nation’s assets.  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 9,485 per dollar as of 3:19
p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency reached 9,496 earlier, the weakest
since July 27, and lost 4.4 percent this year. One-month implied
volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was steady at 7.50 percent.  Standard & Poor’s  said yesterday it may lower Greece’s
credit rating if the country is unable to obtain its next aid
package. Indonesian exports dropped 16.4 percent in June from a
year earlier, the biggest decline since 2009, official data
showed last week.  Government bonds  were little changed before a
policy meeting tomorrow, at which 25 of 26 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg predict  Bank Indonesia  will hold its  reference rate 
at  5.75 percent . One expects a 25 basis point cut.  “Global sentiment is weighing on the rupiah,” said Putu
Andi Wijaya, a foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank Rakyat
Indonesia in Jakarta. “A rate hold would be in line with
expectations. A cut is possible but unlikely because of the
fragile rupiah.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
was little changed at 5.73 percent, the highest level since July
30, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
