Sheldon Adelson , chairman of the  Las
Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , sued the National Jewish Democratic Council
and its top officers for libel, saying the organization falsely
claimed he approved of prostitution in his Macau casinos.  Adelson, a billionaire and top fundraiser for Republican
 Mitt Romney ’s presidential campaign, filed his $10 million suit
today in Manhattan federal court. He claims the NJDC, its
president,  David Harris , and its chairman, Marc Stanley,
“crossed the threshold from constitutionally protected speech
to defamation of a public figure.”  The suit is over an article that Adelson says was authored
by Harris and posted on the NJDC website claiming Adelson
approved of prostitution in his Macau casinos and urging Romney
to cease accepting his donations. The article cites allegations
made in a separate lawsuit by an employee of  Sands China Ltd. (1928) ,
Adelson says. Adelson denies the claims.  “We will not be bullied into submission,” the NJDC said
in an e-mailed statement. “Referencing mainstream press
accounts examining the conduct of a public figure and his
business ventures -- as we did -- is wholly appropriate.”  On its website, the group says its goal is to win “Jewish
support for Democrats at the federal and state levels of
government.”  The suit is Adelson v. Harris, 12-cv-6052, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
