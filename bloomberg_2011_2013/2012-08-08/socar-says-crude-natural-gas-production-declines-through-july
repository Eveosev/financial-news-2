State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan , also
known as Socar, pumped less oil and natural gas in the first
seven months of 2012 from a year earlier.  Oil production declined 2.5 percent to 4.79 million metric
tons, and gas output fell 3.4 percent to 3.99 billion cubic
meters, the Baku-based energy producer said on its  website 
today. No reason was given for the decline.  Last year, Socar, which is fully owned by the Azeri
government, produced 8.4 million tons of oil and 7.1 billion
cubic meters of gas, down from 8.5 million tons of oil and 7.2
billion cubic meters of gas a year before.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and  Kazakhstan , pumped 45.6 million
tons of oil and 25.8 billion cubic meters of gas in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
