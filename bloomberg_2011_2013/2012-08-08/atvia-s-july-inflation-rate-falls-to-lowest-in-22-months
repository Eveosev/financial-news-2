Latvian consumer prices grew at the
slowest pace in 21 months in July as transport costs fell.  The inflation rate dropped to 1.7 percent from 1.9 percent
in June, the  statistics office , based in the capital, Riga, said
today on its website today. That matched the median estimate of
four economists in a Bloomberg survey. Prices fell 0.5 percent
from the previous month.  The Baltic country cut its value-added tax, a sales levy,
by 1 percentage point starting in July to slow inflation as the
government seeks to join  Europe ’s single-currency area in 2014.  To adopt the euro, countries must keep inflation at less
than 1.5 percentage points above the average of the three lowest
levels in the 27-nation European Union. Latvia’s 12-month
consumer-price index was 3.5 percent in June, according to
Eurostat. The threshold for the currency changeover is 3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
