Treasury 10-year yields reached a
five-week high as a $24 billion sale of the notes attracted the
least demand in three years, leaving the Wall Street banks
required to bid at government auctions with their largest share
of the offering since October.  Last month, the previous U.S. 10-year sale drew record high
demand from a group of investors that include pension funds and
insurance companies, who were awarded 45.4 percent of the notes.
At today’s sale, the Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers bought
54.2 percent of the offering, their largest share since October.
Treasuries  rose  earlier on haven demand as a German industrial
production drop, lower U.K. growth forecasts and ratings cuts
for  Spain  and  Italy  raised concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis is worsening.  “The market is starting to look for a more fair market
price and that means higher yields,” said  William O’Donnell ,
head U.S. government-bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc’s RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , a
primary dealer. “Weak bid-to-cover and indirect buying is also
reflective of quiet conditions we’ve seen both in Europe and
domestically.”  The  yield  on the current 10-year note rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.65 percent, at 5 p.m. in
New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75
percent note due in May 2022 lost 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face
amount, to 100 29/32. The yield touched the highest since June
29.  Bid Data  The 10-year auction produced a yield of 1.680 percent,
compared with a forecast of 1.656 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of 10 of the  Federal Reserve ’s primary dealers.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.49
matching the figure from August 2009, and compared with 3.61 in
July and an average of 3.1 for the previous 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 40.6 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 41.4 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 5.2 percent of
the notes, the lowest since February 2011 and compared with a
record 45.4 percent last month and an average of 17.1 percent at
the last 10 auctions.  Skittish Dealers  “Dealers were skittish about setting up for the auction,”
said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse
Group AG in  New York , a primary dealer. “You don’t know if
there’s going to be a big direct bid,” which can push yields
below the market level heading into the offering.  The record direct bid at the July 11 sale left dealers with
a record low 14 percent of the offering. “It makes you wind up
being left short and not being able to get the bonds back,”
Jersey said.  Before sales of government debt, dealers typically try to
push yields higher, often taking short positions, or bets that
yields will rise, in order to buy the securities at levels that
will be more attractive to investors.  The sale was the second of three this week totaling $72
billion, with the U.S. auctioning $16 billion of 30-year bonds
tomorrow. A $32 billion three-year note sale yesterday drew a
yield of 0.37 percent.  Ten-year  U.S. debt  has returned 3.9 percent this year,
nearly doubling the 2 percent gain in the broader Treasury
market. The notes returned 17 percent in 2011, almost double the
9.8 percent gain by Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Fed Moves  The Fed bought $1.9 billion of Treasuries due from February
2036 to May 2042 today, with according to the Fed Bank of New
York  website .  The central bank received $5.901 billion in offers to sell
bonds, or $3.03 for every dollar of debt it sold. The Fed’s Aug.
6 purchase of $4.646 billion of debt maturing from August 2020
to May 2022 attracted $2.51 in bids for each dollar of debt.  The purchases are part of Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan
to contain borrowing costs by swapping short-term Treasuries in
the central bank’s holdings for longer maturities. The Fed is
swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings with longer-
dated debt to put downward pressure on long-term borrowing
costs.  “The more people wanting to sell bonds indicate that
people think the market is a little toppy,” or at a high in
price, said Gary Pollack, who helps oversee $12 billion as head
of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private Wealth
Management unit in New York.  Debt Rating  S&P lowered its outlook on  Greece ’s debt to negative from
stable, which means it is more inclined to reduce its ranking
for the nation.  Spain was cut two steps to A (low) from A
(high) and Italy was downgraded one level to A, Toronto-based
DBRS said in a statement. Ireland’s grade was confirmed at A
(low), four steps from junk.  German exports, adjusted for work days and seasonal
changes, dropped 1.5 percent in June from May, when they jumped
4.2 percent, the Federal Statistics Office said in Wiesbaden.
Industrial production fell 0.9 percent from May, when it gained
1.7 percent, the  Economy Ministry  said in Berlin.  Treasury trading volume reported by ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , averaged $197
billion in the two previous trading days this week, compared
with an average of $253.2 billion last week. Trading has
averaged $240.7 billion this year.  “Volumes are down,” said Guy Haselmann, an interest-rate
strategist at primary dealer Bank of  Nova Scotia  in New York.
“People are prepared to act, but only when they know what
they’re really responding to. They just don’t want to get caught
up in the illiquidity and noise of the summer marketplace.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
