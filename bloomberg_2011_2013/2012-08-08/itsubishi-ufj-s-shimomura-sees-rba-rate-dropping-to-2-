Hideo Shimomura, who helps oversee
the equivalent of $76.4 billion in  Tokyo  as chief fund investor
at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., part of Japan’s largest
publicly traded bank, comments on  Australia  interest rates.  The  Reserve Bank of Australia  held its  target  for overnight
bank loans at 3.5 percent yesterday.  Policy makers are is waiting to see how their 1.25
percentage points of reductions from November to June affect the
economy, Shimomura said.  “They have to cut again,” he said yesterday after the RBA
decision. “We could see a series starting in October or
November. Domestic demand is still quite weak. The currency
level is still high, and import prices are tame. There’s not a
lot of  inflation  pressure, and it gives the RBA room to cut.”  The  Reserve Bank  will reduce its key rate to 2 percent in
12 months, he said. That would be the lowest on record. He
predicts the yield on the 10-year note will fall to 2.4 percent
by Dec. 31 from its current level of 3.33 percent. That would
also be an all-time low.  Australian retail  sales  climbed 1 percent in June from May,
the most since March, according to government figures released
on Aug. 2. They stopped growing at the end of 2011 and declined
in April.  Prices for imported goods increased 2.4 percent in the
second quarter from the prior three months, rebounding from a
1.2 percent decline in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
