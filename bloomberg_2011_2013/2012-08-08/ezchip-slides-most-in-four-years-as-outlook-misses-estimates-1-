EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH) , an Israeli
maker of network processors, sank the most in four years in U.S.
trading after its forecast for third-quarter revenue fell short
of analysts’ estimates.  EZchip slumped 25 percent to $29.43 by 12:46 p.m. in  New
York , the most since October 2008. Its Tel Aviv shares slid 1
percent to 151.3 shekels, or the equivalent of $37.91.  The Yokneam, Israel-based company forecast third-quarter
sales of $8 million to $10 million, lower than the $17.9 million
mean estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “It is a very disappointing short-term guidance that
delays our expected revenue ramp,” EZchip Chief Executive
Officer Eli Fruchter said in a statement today.  The global economic slowdown reduced the capital spending
of major telecommunication carriers, EZchip said in a conference
call with investors today. The company’s three biggest customers
are  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) ,  ZTE Corp. (763) , and  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR) , it
said.  “The third quarter guidance is causing share prices to
decline,” Gary Mobley, an analyst at Benchmark Co., said by
phone from  St. Louis  today. “The reason for the substantial
disappointment is because it relies on three customers for 75
percent of its revenue.”  The company reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of 29
cents per share, surpassing the 26-cent mean estimate of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
