Cotton production in  Guinea  started
in May after a four-year halt, according to the countryâ€™s
 Finance Ministry .  The West African nation produced 365 metric tons of the
fiber from May to June this year, compared with 730 tons in
2008, an e-mailed report from the Conakry-based ministry showed,
without giving a reason for the stoppage.  In the six months through June, palm oil output plummeted
to 156 tons from 6,372 tons in the same period a year earlier,
according to the statement. Coffee rose 91 percent to 29,406
tons, while cocoa fell to 8,696 tons from 20,361 tons in 2011,
the ministry said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
