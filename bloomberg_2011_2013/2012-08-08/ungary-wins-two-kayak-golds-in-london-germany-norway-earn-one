The U.S. swept to four golds in a 35-
minute span last night at the London Olympics. Along with two
silvers and two bronzes in those four events, that propelled the
Americans atop the total medals count ahead of  China .  Allyson Felix finally got gold in the women’s 200 meters
before Aries Merritt won the men’s 110-meter hurdles. Brittney
Reese then placed first in the women’s long jump, and Misty May- Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings completed the gold-medal burst
by winning their third straight beach volleyball title.  May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings, 33, needed just 36 minutes
to beat U.S. countrywomen April Ross and Jen Kessy 21-16, 21-16.
May-Treanor, who said she’ll retire after these games, and Walsh
Jennings have now won 21 straight Olympic matches.  “It means the world,” May-Treanor, 35, said. “We set our
expectations really high as a team, as people and as players.
It’s tough to play your own country, but it’s nice to have an
all-U.S. final.”  Americans have a games-leading 81 total medals, four more
than China, which heads the medal standings on account of having
36 golds to the U.S.’s 34.  The final of the men’s 200 meters is among 23 medal events
scheduled today as the London games move into their final four
days. The championship match of the women’s soccer tournament, a
repeat of the 2011 World Cup final in which  Japan  defeated the
U.S., also will be played tonight.  In the men’s 200, Usain Bolt of  Jamaica  will be trying to
complete his second straight Olympic 100-200 sweep. Bolt, 25,
won the 100 title four days ago in an Olympic-record time of
9.63 seconds.  Felix’s Revenge  Felix, 26, ran the women’s 200 in 21.88 to take the gold
after finishing second to Jamaica’s Veronica Campbell-Brown in
the past two Olympics. Campbell-Brown was fourth.  Felix, a three-time world champion at 200 meters, finished
ahead of Jamaica’s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, 25, the two-time
100-meter Olympic champion, who was second in 22.09. American
Carmelita Jeter, 32, finished third in 22.14.  “It’s been a long time coming,” Felix said. “I’ve waited
so long for this moment.”  Merritt, 27, and  Jason Richardson  then gave the U.S. a 1-2
finish in the men’s 110-meter hurdles, and Reese, 25, won the
women’s long jump ahead of Russian Elena Sokolova and American
Janay Deloach.  Russia’s Natalya Antyukh, 31, won the women’s 400-meter
hurdles. Lashinda Demus of the U.S. got silver, and Zuzana
Hejnova of the  Czech Republic  was third.  Men’s Basketball  Kobe Bryant  of the  National Basketball Association ’s  Los
Angeles Lakers  scored 20 points and  LeBron James  of the  Miami
Heat  had a triple-double -- 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12
assists -- as the U.S. defeated Australia 119-86 in men’s
basketball to move into a semifinal tomorrow against Argentina,
which beat Brazil 82-77. In the other quarterfinals,  Russia 
defeated Lithuania 83-74 and Spain topped France 66-59.  China swept the table tennis competition as Ma Long, Zhang
Jike and Wang Hao won the men’s team event. The Chinese also won
gold in men’s singles, as well as the women’s team and singles
events, and captured two silvers.  “There may be only three people in this team, but this is
for the millions in China watching us,” Wang, 28, said.  The first two taekwondo medals of the games were won by
China’s Wu Jingyu in the women’s 49-kilogram event and Spain’s
Joel Gonzalez Bonilla in men’s 58kg competition.  Italy upset the defending-champion U.S. 3-0 in men’s
volleyball and will be joined in the semifinals by  Brazil ,
Russia and  Bulgaria .  “When we play like this, anyone struggles to beat us,”
Italy’s Cristian Savani said. “We played with courage and I am
happy because we showed what Italy is.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
