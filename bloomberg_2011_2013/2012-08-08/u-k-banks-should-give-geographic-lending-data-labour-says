U.K. banks should be forced to
publish detailed information on their lending to encourage
activity in deprived areas, the opposition  Labour Party  said.  In a policy paper published in London today, the party
pointed to the 1975 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act in the U.S.,
which requires banks to give details about where, how much and
to what ethnic and income groups they’re lending.  Such information is unavailable in the U.K., and Labour
lawmaker Gareth Thomas said its absence has helped create a
situation where an area such as Thamesmead in southeast London
has 55,000 people and no banks.  “Consistent disclosure by the banks of anonymized data on
what they lend, to whom and where, and stronger incentives to
work in all communities including with community banks, could
help banks become more accountable to the communities they
serve,” said Thomas in an e-mailed statement. “Over time it
could also help government, banks themselves, community banks
and the third sector plug the gaps in the market for access to
financial services.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
