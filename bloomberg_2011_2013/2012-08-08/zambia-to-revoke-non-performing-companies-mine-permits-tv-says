Zambia, which wants to create jobs,
will repeal mining licenses from non-performing companies,
 Zambia National Broadcasting Corp.  said, citing Deputy Mines
Minister Richard Musukwa.  The government has already issued notices to some mining-
license holders that have failed to create employment, the
state-owned broadcaster said. Only so-called sound companies
would receive licenses, he said, without providing more
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
