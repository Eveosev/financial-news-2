Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest
carmaker, will build an engine factory in Brazil to cater to
increasing demand in the world’s fourth-biggest auto market.  Toyota will invest about 1 billion reais ($495 million) in
an engine plant in  Sao Paulo  that should begin production by the
second half of 2015, Chief Executive Officer  Akio Toyoda  told
reporters in Brasilia yesterday. The new factory will have a
planned capacity of about 200,000 units a year and supply
engines for the Etios and Corolla compact cars, according to the
company.  Toyota is expanding output in Latin America’s biggest
economy as it targets getting half its sales from emerging
markets by 2015. The automaker, which currently has two assembly
factories in Brazil, will hold a ceremony today to mark the
completion of a third plant that will produce the Etios, due to
be sold in the country later this year.  The carmaker is targeting a doubling of sales in Brazil to
200,000 vehicles this year, spokesman Joichi Tachikawa said
yesterday. The automaker has said it will introduce its Prius
hybrid in the country this year.  Toyota joins  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  in announcing plans to expand
in Brazil. Nissan Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said last
October that the automaker plans to spend 2.6 billion reais on a
car plant in Resende.  Brazil’s industrywide auto deliveries rose 13 percent to
3.43 million units last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Gross domestic product grew at an annualized 0.8
percent rate in the first quarter. Industrial output fell 5.5
percent in June from the year before, and retail sales in May
fell by 0.8 percent from April, the most in more than three
years.  Toyota rose 0.3 percent as of 10:30 a.m. in Tokyo. The
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
