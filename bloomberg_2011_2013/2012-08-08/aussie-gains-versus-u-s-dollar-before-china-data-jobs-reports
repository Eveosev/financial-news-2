The Australian dollar rose against
its U.S. counterpart before a report that’s forecast to show the
nation’s employers added jobs in July.  New Zealand ’s dollar declined against the greenback before
data that may show the nation’s unemployment rate fell in the
second quarter from the highest level since 2010.  China ,
Australia’s largest trading partner, reports data today on
consumer and producer prices.  The Aussie dollar gained 0.2 percent to $1.0571 yesterday
in  New York  after touching $1.0604 on Aug. 7, the highest since
March 20. The currency slipped less than 0.1 percent to 82.93
yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, declined less
than 0.1 percent to 81.58 U.S. cents. It fell 0.3 percent to
63.94 yen.  Consumer prices in China, the world’s second largest
economy, rose 1.7 percent in July from the previous year,
according the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, compared with a 2.2 percent gain in June. Producer
prices fell 2.5 percent, versus a 2.1 percent drop in June.  Australia added 10,000 jobs last month after dropping
27,000 in June, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before the country’s Bureau of
Statistics reports the data today. The  unemployment rate  likely
increased to 5.3 percent, from 5.2 percent in June.  The  jobless rate  in New Zealand fell to 6.5 percent in the
second quarter, another Bloomberg survey forecast before
 Statistics New Zealand  issues the data today. It was 6.7 percent
in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
