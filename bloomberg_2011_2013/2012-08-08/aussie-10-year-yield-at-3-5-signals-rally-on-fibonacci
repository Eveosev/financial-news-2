Australia ’s 10-year yield may draw
demand as it climbs toward 3.52 percent, according to  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , citing trading patterns.  A Fibonacci graph shows the level is a 50 percent
retracement of a decline from this year’s high of 4.345 percent
on March 20 to a record low of 2.698 on June 4.  The rate was as high as 3.38 percent yesterday, rising
through the previous Fibonacci level marking 38.2 percent of the
retracement. According to Fibonacci analysis, clearing one
hurdle opens the way for a move to the next.  “Yields could push higher,” said  Peter Jolly , the Sydney-
based head of market research for National Australia, the
nation’s biggest bank by assets. “Buyers will come back in as
we get above 3 1/2 percent.”  Ten-year note yields ended yesterday at 3.32 percent.  The next Fibonacci level after 3.52 percent is 3.72
percent. The  analysis  is based on a series of numbers developed
by 13th-century mathematician Leonardo da Pisa, known as
Fibonacci. Analysts use the numbers to determine levels where
buy and sell orders may be clustered.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
