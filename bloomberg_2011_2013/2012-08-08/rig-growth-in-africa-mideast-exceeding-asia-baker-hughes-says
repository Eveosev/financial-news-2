Energy explorers deployed rigs at a
faster pace in Africa and the  Middle East  in July, while
drilling in Asia contracted, according to data compiled by  Baker
Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Rigs used in Africa have announced gas discoveries, totaled
105 last month, up 72 percent from a year earlier, Baker Hughes,
an oilfield-services company, said on its  website.  Drilling
equipment in the Middle East rose 40 percent, while rigs in Asia
shrunk 4.5 percent.  There were 401 rigs operating on land and sea in the Middle
East, excluding Iraq, up from 287 a year earlier, according to
the data. Asia had 233 in operation last month, compared with
244 a year earlier.  The total international rig count excluding the U.S. and
Canada stood at 1,264, compared with 1,150 a year earlier, Baker
Hughes said. The figures include offshore and onshore drill
sites and exclude those in Iran and onshore in China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
