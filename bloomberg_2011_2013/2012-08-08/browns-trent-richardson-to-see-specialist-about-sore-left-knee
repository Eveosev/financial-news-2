Cleveland Browns  running back Trent
Richardson, the third pick in this year’s  National Football
League  draft, will have his ailing left knee further evaluated
by a specialist tomorrow, the team said in a statement.  Richardson, who was a Heisman Trophy finalist after helping
the University of Alabama win the national title, had
arthroscopic surgery on his knee Feb. 3. The rookie missed the
Browns’ practice yesterday because of soreness in the knee.  The Browns traded up one spot in April’s draft to select
Richardson, who rushed for 1,679 yards and 21 touchdowns as a
junior at Alabama last season. He signed a four-year contract
last month that ESPN said is worth $20.4 million.  The Browns, whose rushing offense ranked 28th out of 32 NFL
teams last year in going 4-12, open the regular season on Sept.
9 against the Philadelphia Eagles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
