The shares of  PrimaCom AG (PRC) , the German
business that filed for insolvency in 2010, more than quadrupled
in price in two days as investors confused the company with the
similarly named PrimaCom Berlin GmbH.  PrimaCom shares rose from 23.9 cents on Aug 6 to 1.118
euros in Frankfurt trading today. PrimaCom AG handed over German
cable operator PrimaCom Berlin GmbH to lenders in a debt-for-
equity swap in January 2011.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Germany ’s largest phone company, is
among bidders for PrimaCom Berlin GmbH, according to people
familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News reported Aug. 6.  “PrimaCom AG has nothing to do with PrimaCom Berlin GmbH
anymore that may be bought by Deutsche Telekom,” said Heike Pauls, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank AG. “The rise
in the share price of PrimaCom AG seems to show that some in the
financial markets have not fully realized this.”  The principal owners of PrimaCom Berlin GmbH are Alcentra
Group Ltd., Avenue Capital Group,  ING Groep NV (INGA)  and Tennenbaum
Capital Partners LLC.  A spokesman for PrimaCom Berlin GmbH didn’t immediately
respond to calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
