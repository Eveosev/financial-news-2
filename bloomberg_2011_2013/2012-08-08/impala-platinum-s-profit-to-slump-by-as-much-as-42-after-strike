Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the
second-largest producer of the precious metal, expects headline
and basic earnings for the year ended June 30 to drop as much as
42 percent after a strike cut production at its biggest mine.  Basic and headline earnings probably declined to 6.45 rand
($0.79) to 6.95 rand, compared with 11.05 rand profit in the
previous year, the company said in a statement.  The decline is “primarily due to lower sales volumes as a
result of the strike” at the Rustenburg operations in  South
Africa ’s North West Province, the Johannesburg-based company
said. Production at the mine stopped for six weeks at the start
of the year during a battle for control between labor unions.  The operation averaged about 90 percent capacity in June
and the strike cost Impala more than 120,000 ounces of output,
it said May 29. Platinum, used in devices to cut car emissions
and to make jewelry, slid about 18 percent in the past year.  Impala fell 1 percent to 132.12 rand in Johannesburg
trading. The stock has declined 21 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
