President  Barack Obama  leads
presumptive Republican nominee  Mitt Romney  in Virginia and
 Wisconsin  and trails him in  Colorado , according to a poll of the
three swing states released today.  The Quinnipiac University-New York Times-CBS News shows
advantages for Obama in Virginia, by 49 percent to 45 percent,
and in Wisconsin, scene of the recent unsuccessful recall of
Republican Governor  Scott Walker , by 51 percent to 45 percent.
Romney was ahead in Colorado, by 50 percent to 45 percent. Only
in Wisconsin was the lead outside the margin of error of plus or
minus 2.6 percentage points.  “There is good reason why Virginia, Colorado and Wisconsin
are considered swing states -- and this data shows how close
they are,” said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the
Quinnipiac University Polling Institute in Hamden,  Connecticut .  Obama led by eight points among female voters in Colorado,
14 points in Virginia and 23 points in Wisconsin, Romney did
better among men, ahead by 17 points in Colorado, five points in
Virginia and 10 points in Wisconsin.  Only voters in Wisconsin said they approved of Obama’s job
performance, by 51 percent to 46 percent. In Colorado, 53
percent disapproved and 44 percent approved, and in Virginia,
voters disapproved of his performance in office by 49 percent to
47 percent.  Top Issue  Likely voters in all three states identified the economy as
the top issue in the presidential race. One-fourth of voters in
all three states felt the economy was getting better, with
pluralities in Colorado and  Virginia  saying it was getting
worse. In Wisconsin, 38 percent said the economy was staying the
same and 36 percent said it was getting worse.  In Colorado, 51 percent of likely voters said they believed
Romney would do a better job on the economy, a 10-point edge
over Obama. In Virginia, Romney’s lead was 47 percent to 45
percent, and Obama had a 47 percent to 46 percent edge in
Wisconsin.  The telephone poll was conducted July 31-Aug. 6 and
surveyed 1,463 likely voters in Colorado, 1,412 likely voters in
Virginia and 1,428 likely voters in Wisconsin.  ABC-Post Poll  A separate survey showed Romney with the lowest favorable
rating among Republican presidential candidates since then-Vice
President  George H.W. Bush  in 1988 and the only candidate with a
net negative rating looking back to at least 1984.  The ABC News-Washington Post poll found 49 percent of
Americans rating Romney unfavorably and 40 percent rating him
favorably. Bush, who was elected president, had a 41 percent
favorable rating and a 38 percent unfavorable rating.  Obama had a 53 percent favorable rating and a 43 percent
unfavorable rating in the ABC-Post poll.  Again, Obama does better among women, with 58 percent
viewing him favorably, compared with 36 percent for Romney.
Among men, 47 percent viewed Obama favorably and 44 percent gave
Romney a favorable rating. Among independents, 53 percent view
Obama favorably compared with 37 percent for Romney.  The Aug. 1-5 telephone survey of 1,026 adults has a margin
of error of plus or minus four percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
