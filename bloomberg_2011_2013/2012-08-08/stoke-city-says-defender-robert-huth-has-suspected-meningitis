English Premier League soccer club
 Stoke City  said defender  Robert Huth  is in the hospital with
suspected meningitis and will undergo further tests.  Huth, 27, was rushed to the hospital two days ago after
symptoms which first became apparent in the United States got
progressively worse following his return to the U.K., the team
said today in a statement on its website.  “It’s a massive, massive worry for us,” Stoke manager
 Tony Pulis  said in the statement. “We don’t know the full
extent of it at the moment, but he’ll be undergoing more tests,
so hopefully we’ll know more about the situation with him on
Wednesday.”  Huth won two Premier League titles with Chelsea before
moving to Middlesbrough in 2006. He joined Stoke three years ago
for a fee of about 5 million pounds ($7.8 million).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
