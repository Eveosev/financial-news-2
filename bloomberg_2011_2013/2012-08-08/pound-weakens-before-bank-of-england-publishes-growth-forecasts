The pound weakened on speculation the
 Bank of England  will cut its forecasts for growth and consumer
prices when it releases its quarterly Inflation Report today.  Sterling fell against all except two of its 16 major
counterparts. The central bank, which kept its bond-purchase
target at 375 billion pounds ($584 billion) and its benchmark
 interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent last week, will
release its new forecasts at 10:30 a.m. London time. All 16
economists in a Bloomberg News survey say the Bank of England
will lower its 2012 economic outlook, while all but one see a
reduction in the 2013 projections.  The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5587 at 9:08 a.m. London
time. The U.K. currency weakened 0.5 percent to 122.19 yen, and
was little changed at 79.40 pence per euro.  Sterling has dropped 3 percent in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar rose 1 percent in the
period, and the yen gained 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
