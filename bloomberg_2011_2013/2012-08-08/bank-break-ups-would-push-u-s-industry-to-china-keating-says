Breaking up the largest U.S. banks
would push businesses such as  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Boeing Co. (BA)  to
use Chinese lenders instead, said  Frank Keating , chief executive
officer of the  American Bankers Association .  “The only place in the  United States  right now that has a
balance of payment surplus is financial services. So we’re going
to break up the banks and turn over Caterpillar’s business and
Boeing’s business to the Chinese,” Keating said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “Are we going to do that
really?”  Keating, whose organization is the largest trade group for
U.S. banks, said he is worried about the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act’s
effects on smaller commercial banks, which cannot handle the
“mountain of regulation, this mountain of uncertainty, this
mountain of potential tax and regulatory liability.”  Banking leaders and regulators cannot allow “misguided
anger over what happened in the fall of ’08 to destroy what has
been essential for the success of America,” he said about U.S.
commercial banks. Banking and regulatory leaders must instead
ensure that they “lubricate the financial service industry,”
Keating said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
