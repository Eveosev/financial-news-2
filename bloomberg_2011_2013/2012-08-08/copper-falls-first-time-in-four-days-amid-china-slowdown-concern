Copper declined for the first time in
four days on concern that demand from  China , the world’s biggest
user, may wane amid an economic slowdown.  Three-month metal lost as much as 1 percent to $7,504 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $7,523.25
at 4:15 p.m. in  Seoul . Futures for September delivery dropped
0.9 percent to $3.4095 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  “The overall tone of the market remains dominated by
uncertainties over the health of  China’s economy  and demand,”
Chris Kwon, a commodities trader at KTB Investment & Securities
Inc., said by phone from Seoul. “Inventories are rising and
demand is still very weak in China, while the risk that Europe’s
crisis could worsen remains.”  Data due later this week on inflation and retail sales may
show that China’s economy hasn’t bottomed out yet. The country
may say tomorrow that producer prices slid 2.5 percent last
month after dropping 2.1 percent in June, according to a
Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Inventories tracked by the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose
4.9 percent to 164,111 tons last week, jumping 76 percent this
year, according to bourse data. Metal for November delivery
closed unchanged at 54,700  yuan  ($8,591) a ton on the bourse.  Inbound shipments were 250,097 tons in June, compared with
301,990 in May, according to the General Administration of
Customs. On the LME, lead, zinc, aluminum and nickel also
declined.  To contact the reporters on this story:
