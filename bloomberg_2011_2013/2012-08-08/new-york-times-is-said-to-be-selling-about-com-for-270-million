New York Times Co. (NYT)  climbed 6.1
percent after the newspaper publisher entered talks to sell
About.com, aiming to salvage a portion of its ill-fated bet on
the website.  The company confirmed the negotiations in a  statement 
today, without giving details. A person with knowledge of the
deal said the New York Times is trying to sell the Web property
to Answers.com for $270 million. The proposed deal was reported
earlier today by  the AllThingsD site .  The shares rose to $8.57 at the close in New York, the most
since July 26. The stock has climbed 11 percent this year.  The move would further the New York Times’ strategy of
offloading businesses and tightening its focus on the New York
Times media brand. It sold its stake in Fenway Sports Group,
owner of the  Boston Red Sox , for $93 million this year and
completed the sale of its regional newspaper division for $143
million. The publisher still owns the Boston Globe and Worcester
Telegram & Gazette newspapers.  The company purchased About.com for $410 million in 2005.
The site, which relies on freelancers to produce stories and
how-to videos on a wide range of topics, has struggled to
attract traffic and advertising dollars. About.com’s revenue
fell 8.7 percent to $25.4 million last quarter, and it posted an
operating loss of $186.8 million as the New York Times wrote
down the current value of the business to $172.5 million.  Answers.com, a similar site that calls itself “the most
trusted place for answering life’s questions,” was founded in
1998. The St. Louis-based company didn’t respond to requests for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
