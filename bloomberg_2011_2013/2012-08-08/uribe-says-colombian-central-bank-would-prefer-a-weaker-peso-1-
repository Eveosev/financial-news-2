Colombia’s  central bank  would like to
see a weaker peso, bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said.  “We would like the  exchange rate  to be a bit more
devalued,” Uribe told lawmakers in Bogota. “Without doubt, its
behavior has worried us.”  The peso has gained 9.1 percent this year, the most of 170
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, leading to complaints from
exporters including coffee and flower growers. The central bank
today published a  report  saying that the benefits of
accumulating extra reserves have to be weighed against the cost
of foregoing more lucrative investments.  Uribe said that the  European debt crisis  has affected
China, leading to a fall in prices for Colombia’s commodities
exports. The slowing world economy was one of the reasons the
central bank cited last month in its surprise decision to cut
 interest rates  for the first time since 2010.  Policy makers cut the benchmark interest rate to 5 percent
from 5.25 percent, with two board members arguing for a larger,
half-point cut.  The national statistics agency publishes the June export
figures later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
