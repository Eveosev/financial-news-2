India ’s bonds advanced, pushing the
10-year yield to the lowest level in almost two weeks, on
optimism the country’s new finance minister will be able to rein
in the government’s budget deficit.  The yield has fallen 12 basis points this week as
Palaniappan Chidambaram said in a speech on Aug. 6, his first
after starting the new job, that he intended to clarify tax laws
and unveil “a path of fiscal consolidation.” Asia’s third-
largest economy aims to reduce its budget  shortfall  to 5.1
percent of gross domestic product in the year ending March 2013,
from 5.8 percent in the previous 12 months.  “There is optimism, which didn’t exist for a very long
time,” said Sudarshan Bhatt, chief of foreign-exchange trading
at  Corporation Bank  in Mumbai. “Investors are pricing in some
positive developments on the deficit front.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.14 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That is
the lowest level since July 27.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, climbed three
basis points to 7.74 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
