New York Giants cornerback  Terrell Thomas  said he expects to return to the field in three to eight
weeks after reinjuring his surgically-repaired right knee during
a preseason practice.  “I think that this was just a minor scare more than
anything,” Thomas said after having his knee examined by a
third doctor. “You just got to give it time. Let it heal.”  Thomas, 27, missed the Giants’ run to a Super Bowl title
last season after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in a
preseason game. When he hurt his knee in a July 30 practice,
tests showed he didn’t tear the ACL again.  “Aggravated, that’s the best way to put it,” Thomas told
reporters today at training camp in  Albany , New York.  The Giants open the National Football League regular season
on Sept. 5 against the  Dallas Cowboys . Thomas said while he’ll
try to be back for the opener, he and the team will probably
take their time before making a decision.  “The big picture is the long run -- the rest of the
season, getting to the playoffs -- not starting Week 1,” Thomas
said. “If I can get out there, I’m going to be out there, but
I’m not going to jeopardize my career.”  A second-round pick in the 2008 draft, Thomas became a
full-time starter in 2009, when he had a team-high 85 tackles
and five interceptions. He led the team in the same categories
in 2010, recording 101 tackles and five interceptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
