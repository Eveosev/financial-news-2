U.S. stocks rose, rebounding from
earlier losses in benchmark indexes, as a rally in Hewlett-
Packard Co. offset Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President
 Richard Fisher ’s remark that adequate stimulus is in place.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  rose 2.7 percent after raising its
earnings forecast and appointing a new head for its enterprise
services unit as it restructures the business. Dean Foods Co.
surged 37 percent as its WhiteWave unit filed to raise $300
million in a U.S. initial public offering. McDonald’s Corp. slid
1.7 percent amid unchanged July global sales. Priceline.com
Inc., the biggest U.S. online travel agency by market value,
tumbled 16 percent on a disappointing earnings forecast.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,403.75 at 11:45 a.m. New York time, after falling 0.4 percent
earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 30.61 points, or
0.2 percent, to 13,199.21. Trading in S&P 500 companies was down
9.7 percent from the 30-day average at this time of day.  The S&P 500 has rebounded almost 10 percent from a five-
month low on June 1. The rally brought the index to 1,401.35
yesterday, the highest level since May 2 and above 1,389, which
is the average year-end forecast among Wall Street strategists.  Equities dropped earlier today as the Fed’s Fisher said
global central banks may not have the capacity to undertake
additional measures. Stocks rose yesterday as Fed Bank of Boston
President  Eric Rosengren  said the central bank should pursue an
“open-ended” easing program of “substantial magnitude.”  ‘Can’t Hurt’  “Stimulus can’t hurt, but the problem is that it has less
and less effect,” said Madelynn Matlock, who helps oversee
about $14.7 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati.
“Any argument by policymakers is going to pull the market in
various directions, depending on what they are saying.”  Investors also watched corporate results. Almost 59 percent
of S&P 500 companies which reported second-quarter  sales  so far
have missed analysts’ estimates, Bloomberg data showed.  Hewlett-Packard rallied 2.7 percent to $19.48. Profit
excluding some items in the current period will be $1, up from a
prior projection of 94 cents to 97 cents, the Palo Alto,
California-based company said today in a statement.  Dean Foods Co. (DF)  jumped 37 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $16.97. The proceeds will be used to pay down debt at Dallas-
based Dean, according to the filing. Dean said yesterday in a
statement that it will own at least 80 percent of WhiteWave’s
common stock following the IPO and distribute those shares to
its investors at least 180 days after the offering.  Initial Offering  Cincinnati Bell Inc. (CBB)  added 11 percent to $4.14 after
proposing an initial public offering for its CyrusOne unit, a
data-center operator it acquired in 2010.  Macy’s Inc. (M)  rose 3 percent to $38.09. The owner of its
namesake and Bloomingdale’s department stores reported second-
quarter profit that beat estimates, helped by its credit cards.  Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC)  gained 17 percent to $29.86. The
technology contractor for government and corporate customers
reported profit and revenue that  topped  estimates as its new
chief executive officer works on turning the company around.  Express Scripts Holding Co. added 7.4 percent to $60.17.
The largest U.S. processor of drug prescriptions  raised  its
annual profit forecast as gross margins improved following its
April acquisition of Medco Health Solutions Inc.  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR)  soared 17 percent to $2.40.
The second-largest U.S. polysilicon maker jumped after second-
quarter sales of solar projects boosted its  cash flow .  Adding Customers  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)  rose 2.5 percent to $20.02. The company,
which agreed to buy GenOn Energy Inc. to become the largest U.S.
independent power plant owner, reported second-quarter  profit 
that beat estimates as costs fell and it added customers.  A123 Systems Inc. (AONE)  advanced 2.4 percent to 48 cents. The
maker of lithium batteries signed a $450 million non-binding
financing agreement with Wanxiang Group Corp., China’s largest
auto-components company.  McDonald’s slumped 1.7 percent to $87.54. Analysts
projected an increase of 2.3 percent, the average of estimates
compiled by Consensus Metrix. Sales at domestic locations fell
0.1 percent. Analysts estimated a gain of 2.2 percent.  Priceline tumbled 16 percent to $570.95. Consumers in
 Europe (PCLN)  -- one of the main engines of growth for Priceline -- put
off travel amid an economic crisis there. The company had been
boosting sales in the region after the 2005 acquisition of
Amsterdam-based Booking.com. Results were also dragged down as
the strength of the U.S. dollar eroded the value of overseas
receipts, said Chief Executive Officer Jeffery Boyd.  Expedia, Orbitz  Rival  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  declined 5.7 percent to $55.49, while
 Orbitz Worldwide Inc. (OWW)  decreased 25 percent to $3.49.  TripAdvisor
Inc. (TRIP)  retreated 5.6 percent to $36.50.  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  declined 5.7 percent to $6.51.
The second-largest U.S. coal producer  lowered  its metallurgical
coal sales forecast for 2012 as steel output declined in Europe
and slowed in China.  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  slipped 0.8 percent to $30.43. The
second-largest U.S. satellite-television provider reported
second-quarter profit that  missed  analysts’ estimates as the
company’s average revenue per user trailed projections.  Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL)  sank 2.1 percent to $149.84. The
retailer of its namesake brand clothing projected second-quarter
sales that trailed analysts’  estimates .  Warner Chilcott Plc (WCRX)  fell 7.6 percent to $16.42. The
drugmaker specializing in women’s health and dermatology said it
has ended efforts to find a buyer for the  company .  ‘Make-or-Break’  The  S&P 500  is in a “make-or-break situation” that will
probably lead to either large gains or losses for the benchmark
U.S. stocks gauge, according to technical analysts at UBS AG.  After climbing through the 1,390 level, the S&P 500 may go
on to test the highs reached in March and May, Michael Riesner
and Marc Mueller in Zurich wrote in a report dated yesterday. A
drop below 1,325 would indicate a retreat to the early-June low
of 1,266. That would be a 9.7 percent slide from yesterday’s
close of 1,401.35.  Investors should watch the flow of money into so-called
defensive stocks, whose earnings are less dependent on economic
growth, and cyclicals, which are more tied to the performance of
the economy, for signs of future moves in the  S&P 500 (SPX) , the
analysts said.  “The U.S. market remains in a classic make-or-break
situation, where a breakout and a subsequent trend move
shouldn’t be too far away,” they wrote. “Either the market is
able to start a new momentum impulse -- and for this we would
need to see a  rotation  on the sector basis, from defensives into
financials or cyclicals -- or the S&P 500 will very soon get a
breadth problem, when defensives are starting to pull back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
