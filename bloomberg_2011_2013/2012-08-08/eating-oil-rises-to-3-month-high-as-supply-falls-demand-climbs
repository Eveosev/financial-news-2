Heating oil advanced to a three-month
high as U.S. inventories of distillate fuels declined and demand
climbed to the highest level in five weeks.  Futures rose a fourth straight day as the Energy Department
reported that  supplies  of distillates, including heating oil and
diesel, fell 724,000 barrels to 123.5 million last week.
Analysts forecast a 250,000-barrel gain. Wholesale  demand 
increased 1.2 percent to 3.79 million barrels a day. Heating oil
is traded as a substitute for diesel.  “You had a decline in diesel stocks and strong demand,”
said  Sander Cohan , a global transportation fuels analyst and
principal with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
 Massachusetts . “We’re assuming strong exports and winter is
coming.”  Heating oil for September delivery rose 1.79 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.0159 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement since May 3. The September
contract has gained 6.1 percent in four days of advances.  Supplies of heating oil and diesel are 19 percent below a
year earlier, according to department data.  “We’ve seen distillate inventories continue to decline and
we’re continuing to see the effects this year of the refinery
shutdowns in the Northeast and the Caribbean, which would
normally supply our markets,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gulf Coast  The biggest decline, 1.4 million barrels, was in PADD 3,
home to  Gulf Coast  refineries that export diesel to  South
America  and  Europe .  The crack spread, or premium of heating oil over crude,
based on September contracts, widened $1.13 to $33.32, the
largest gap since February.  “Distillate stock levels are tight relative to the five-
year average and export demand is good right now,” said Jim
Colburn, a vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.
“We’re getting beyond the gasoline season and already starting
to look ahead.”  Gasoline for September delivery fell 1.09 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $2.9804 a gallon on the Nymex.  Supplies dropped 1.8 million barrels to 206.1 million. The
largest portion of the decline occurred in PADD 1, where
stockpiles sank 1.14 million barrels to 51.7 million, the lowest
level since November. Changes in PADD 1 inventories can affect
futures prices because the region includes  New York  Harbor, the
delivery point for the Nymex contract.  “We saw gasoline inventories drew once again this week and
now they’re 3 percent to 4 percent lower than this time last
year,” Lipow said.  Gasoline Demand  Gasoline  demand  rose 0.2 percent to 8.84 million barrels a
day, the third consecutive gain. Consumption over the past four
weeks was 4.2 percent below a year earlier.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, gained
1.3 cents to $3.647 a gallon yesterday, AAA data showed. That’s
the highest price since May 25. Prices have climbed 16.2 cents
in 10 days of increases and are down 7.3 percent from a 2012
high of $3.936 on April 4, according data from the nation’s
largest motoring organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
