Hines Real Estate Investment Trust
Inc. hired broker  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  to sell Williams
Tower, a 64-story Houston office building it bought for $271.5
million four years ago.  The 1.4 million-square-foot (130,000-square-meter) tower is
more than 95 percent leased to tenants that include energy
companies  Williams Cos. (WMB)  and  Rowan Cos. (RDC) , as well as Hines, which
sponsors the public, non-traded Hines REIT. The Houston-based
parent company developed the tower in 1983, it said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “Williams Tower is a special asset to Hines REIT and
Hines,” Hines REIT Chief Executive Officer Charles Hazen said
in the statement. “We believe that the time is right to sell
this asset and generate returns for our investors.”  Demand for well-leased office buildings in major U.S.
cities has been high as investors seek the stronger returns and
perceived safety of commercial real estate.  The average price paid for office buildings in Houston fell
to $189 per square foot in the first half of 2012, down 5
percent from a year earlier, according to New York-based
researcher Real Capital Analytics Inc. Transactions involving
such properties fell 19 percent to $941 million in the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
