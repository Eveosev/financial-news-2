Hong Kong ’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at all three of its roadside-monitoring stations,
according to the city’s Environmental Protection Department.  The index was 140 in Central business district, 135 in Mong
Kok and 123 in  Causeway Bay  as of 7 a.m. local time, the
Environmental Protection Department said on its website today.
Roadside pollution of more than 100 triggers a government
warning for people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid
prolonged stays in heavy-traffic areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
