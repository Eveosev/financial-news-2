A heat wave in  South Korea  has killed
almost 800,000 chickens and caused algae outbreaks on rivers,
threatening drinking water.  More than 40,000 ducks, 3,000 quails and 22 pigs have also
died because of scorching heat since late July, the Ministry for
Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The North Asian nation on Aug. 1 issued its first heat wave
warning in Seoul since the system was introduced in 2008 as
temperatures in the capital city rose as high as 35 degrees
Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). The country’s southern regions
are expected to have rain over the weekend, said Jang Hyun Sik,
an official at the Korea Meteorological Administration.  The government is increasing water treatment in the upper
tributaries of the Han River, the source of drinking water for
 Seoul , as green algae emerged due to the lack of precipitation
and “the unprecedented heat wave,” according to the Ministry
of Environment. No poisonous substances were found in drinking
water, the ministry said on its website yesterday.  In a bid to ease the risk of power shortages, the
government issued an alert to reflect a surge in power
consumption and on Aug. 6 resumed operations at its oldest
nuclear reactor. The country gets about a third of its
electricity from nuclear generation.  Idle generation capacity has fallen to less than 3 million
kilowatts, the first time since September 2011, when power
failures occurred in several areas of the nation, Knowledge
Economy Minister Hong Suk Woo told reporters on Aug. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
