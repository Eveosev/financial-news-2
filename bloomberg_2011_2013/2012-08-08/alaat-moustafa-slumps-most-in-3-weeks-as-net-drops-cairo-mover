Talaat Moustafa Group (TMGH)  Holding fell
the most in more than three weeks after  Egypt ’s biggest publicly
traded property developer reported an 11 percent drop in first-
half profit.  The shares  lost 2.3 percent, the most since July 15, to
4.17 Egyptian pounds at the close in Cairo. The benchmark EGX 30
Index retreated 1.1 percent. The stock has rallied 41 percent
this year, compared with a 38 percent increase for the EGX 30.  Net income  for the period that ended in June fell to 328.8
million pounds ($54 million) from 371.2 million pounds a year
earlier, the company said today. Still, sales from all projects
more than doubled to 2.42 billion pounds. The company is facing
renewed court challenge to ownership of its biggest land asset,
a 33-million square meter plot on the outskirts of Cairo, which
it is using for a residential and business development called
 Madinaty .  “We believe they won’t be able to deliver the 8,000 to
10,000 units they forecast this year,” said Habiba Hegab,
equity analyst at Cairo-based Pharos Holding. “The Madinaty
court case is also expected to remain an overhang over sales in
that project in the second half.”  An Egyptian panel of judges recommended last month the
annulment of a revised contract that allowed the government to
sell the land to  Talaat Moustafa , an opinion the company said
wasn’t binding. A court hearing will be held in November to
examine appeals against a ruling by Egypt’s  Administrative Court 
that the sale was legal.  First-half revenue declined to 2.39 billion pounds from
2.55 billion pounds a year earlier. The company didn’t give a
reason for the drop. Jihad Sawaftah, Talaat’s chief financial
officer, didn’t respond to a call and text message to his mobile
phone seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
