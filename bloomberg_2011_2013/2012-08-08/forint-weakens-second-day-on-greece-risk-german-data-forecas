Hungary ’s forint weakened a second
day amid concern Greece’s credit rating may be cut and ahead of
data that may show German industrial output contracting.  The currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 277.60 per euro by
10:20 a.m. in Budapest. The yield on the government bond
maturing in 2022 rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 7.51 percent.  Greece’s credit ranking may be cut again by  Standard &
Poor’s  after the rating agency revised to negative the outlook
on the country’s CCC rating, already eight levels below
investment grade. German  factory output  probably fell 0.8
percent in June from the previous month, when it gained 1.6
percent, a Bloomberg survey of economists showed.  Germany  is
Hungary’s largest trading partner.  Recent gains in the forint have been “overdone” and risks
to Hungary meeting next year’s budget target would justify a
weaker currency, Levente Blaho and Adam Keszeg, analysts at
 Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  in Budapest said in an e-mailed
note today.  The forint has rallied 4.3 percent in the past month,
making it the second-best performer among more than 20 emerging
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
