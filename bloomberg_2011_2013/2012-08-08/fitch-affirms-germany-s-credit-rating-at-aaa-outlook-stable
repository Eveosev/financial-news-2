Germany  retained a stable outlook for
its top  credit rating  at  Fitch Ratings , the second time in less
than a week the country’s prospects were seen unchanged after
Moody’s last month warned the nation’s Aaa grade was at risk.  “The affirmation reflects Germany’s longstanding credit
strengths and robust economic performance over the past two
years,” Fitch said today in an e-mailed statement. “Against
the background of fragile global recovery and the
intensification of the euro-zone crisis, Germany has recorded
strong” economic growth, partly as a result of policy changes.  Even so, a deepening economic contraction in large euro-
region countries could push Germany into recession, with
repercussions for the fiscal position of Europe’s biggest
economy, Fitch said.  Germany is the largest contributor to Europe’s bailout fund
and to the rescue packages for Greece. Any further collapse of
the  Greek economy  and subsequent exit from the euro region has
the potential to destabilize the finances of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government and derail efforts to balance the budget.  Additional contributions to the euro region’s bailout funds
could push German debt above 90 percent of gross domestic
product, “close to the upper limit Fitch generally considers
consistent with a ‘AAA’ rating,” Fitch said. Germany’s rating
would be threated if these risks were to materialize, it said.  Moody’s on July 23 lowered the outlook for the Aaa credit
ratings of Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to negative,
citing “rising uncertainty” over Europe’s debt woes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
