Philippine  government bonds  declined
after a government report showed inflation was faster than
economists predicted, giving the central bank limited room to
cut  interest rates  from a record low.  Consumer prices climbed  3.2 percent  in July from a year
earlier, compared with 2.8 percent in June, the statistics
office reported today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 3.1 percent increase. The peso gained as
markets reopened after being closed yesterday due to flash
flooding in Manila that killed at least 15 people.  “The CPI print is mildly disappointing, which explained
the pullback in the  bond market ,” said Emilio Neri, an
economist at Bank of the Philippine Islands in  Manila . “The
central bank may still have some room to cut but it’s not likely
to be at the next meeting. They need to observe the impact.”  The yield on the 5 percent bonds due August 2018 rose 10
basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 4.70 percent as of
4:46 p.m. in Manila from Aug. 6, according to Tradition
Financial Services.  The price gain is manageable and “bears watching” to see
if it’s prolonged, Governor Amando Tetangco said today. Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas lowered its overnight rate by 25 basis
points to 3.75 percent on July 26. It forecasts inflation will
average 3 percent to 5 percent from 2012 through 2014.  “While the latest inflation remains near the lower-end of
BSP’s target, it reduces scope for another rate cut in the near
term,” said Catherine Bautista, a senior trader of sovereign
bonds at Union Bank of the  Philippines  in Manila. Policy makers
next meet on Sept. 13.  The peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 41.79 per dollar from
41.84 on Aug. 6, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
