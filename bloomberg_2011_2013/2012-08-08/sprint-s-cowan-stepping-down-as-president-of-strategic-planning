Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  President Keith Cowan, who handled strategic planning at the third-largest U.S.
wireless carrier, will be leaving the company at the end of
September.  The company announced the change in a regulatory filing
today, saying the decision was made on Aug. 2. Prior to joining
Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint in 2007, Cowan worked at
 Genuine Parts Co. (GPC)  and BellSouth Corp., which was acquired by
AT&T Inc. that year.  At Sprint, Cowan managed corporate development, including
acquisitions and alliances. He helped the company seek a buyer
for its Nextel network before Sprint abandoned a sale in 2008 in
favor of revamping its technology.  Sprint shares rose 7 percent to $4.61 at the close today in
 New York . The stock has almost doubled in value this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
