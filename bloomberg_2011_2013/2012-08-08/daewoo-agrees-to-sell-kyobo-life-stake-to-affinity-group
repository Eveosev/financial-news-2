Daewoo International Corp. (047050)  agreed to
sell its 24 percent stake in Kyobo Life Insurance Co. to a
consortium led by Affinity Equity Partners Ltd., a Hong Kong-
based buyout firm, Daewoo said in an e-mail yesterday.  Daewoo agreed to sell 4.92 million Kyobo Life shares for
1.2 trillion won ($1.1 billion), the South Korean company said
in a regulatory filing yesterday. The price per share is 245,000
won, according to an e-mailed response to questions from
Bloomberg.  The Affinity group paid 6.5 percent more for its Kyobo
stake than Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, which bought
9.9 percent in the unlisted insurer in June for 230,000 won
apiece. The pension fund bought its stake from state-run  Korea 
Asset Management Corp.  The transaction is Affinity’s first acquisition in the
financial sector in Korea and its first purchase in the country
since it bought a stake in Oriental Brewery Co. Ltd. in 2009,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Daewoo, the steel and crude oil trader controlled by South
Korean steelmaker Posco, didn’t name other members of the
consortium. Officials at Affinity couldn’t be reached to comment
on the purchase yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
