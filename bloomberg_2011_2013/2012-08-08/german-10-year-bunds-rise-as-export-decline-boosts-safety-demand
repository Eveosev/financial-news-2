Germany ’s bonds rose, with 10-year
yields dropping the most in a week, after a report showed the
nation’s exports fell more than analysts forecast on concern the
debt crisis is weakening economies across the region.  The 10-year bund yield fell from the yesterday’s five-week
high after the government sold 3.4 billion euros ($4.2 billion)
of the securities and  Fitch Ratings  affirmed Germany’s AAA
rating. Greek 10-year bonds advanced even after  Standard &
Poor’s  revised the outlook on the nation’s below-investment-
grade credit rating to negative. Spanish and Italian two-year
notes fell for the second day. Companies including  ING Groep NV (INGA) 
and  Securitas AB (SECUB)  reported earnings that missed estimates.  Bunds are rising from “a combination of softening economic
data, coupled with some weaker-than-expected earnings figures,”
said  Brian Barry , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in  London .
“There remain many unanswered questions over the potential
structure and scale of the actions which may be taken” to
address the debt crisis, with “the safe havens benefiting as a
result,” he said.  Germany’s 10-year yield fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.42 percent at 4 p.m. London time. It
earlier fell as much as nine basis points to 1.40 percent. The
yield jumped nine basis points yesterday. The 1.75 percent bond
due July 2022 advanced 0.56, or 5.60 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 102.98.  The two-year note yield slid two basis points to minus 0.05
percent. It fell to minus 0.097 percent Aug. 2, matching the
 lowest  since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1990.  Exports Drop  Exports in  Europe ’s largest economy dropped 1.5 percent
from May, when they rose 4.2 percent, the Federal Statistics
Office in Wiesbaden said today. Economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg
News forecast a 1.3 percent decline.  Another report, from the Economy Ministry in Berlin, showed
industrial production fell 0.9 percent in June from May, when it
gained a revised 1.7 percent.  Germany sold 1.75 percent bunds due July 2022 at an average
yield of 1.42 percent, the Bundesbank said. The nation last
auctioned 10-year bonds on July 11 at a yield of 1.31 percent,
the lowest rate for a bund sale.  Investors bid for 6.26 billion euros of the securities,
versus the maximum target of 4 billion euros, with a so-called
bid-to-cover ratio of 1.84 compared to 1.5 times last month.  “The stronger bid-to-cover shows that there is still a
strong demand for safe-haven assets,” Lyn Graham-Taylor, a
London-based fixed income strategist at Rabobank, wrote in an e-
mailed note. “This fits with our own view that the crisis must
once again worsen in order to force  Spain  to seek a bailout at
the sovereign level.”  ECB Pledge  Italian and Spanish yields plunged last week after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said at press conference on
Aug. 2 that the bank could purchase  government bonds  in unison
with the European Financial Stability Facility. Nations will
need to make a request before the central bank or European
bailout funds will buy their bonds, he said.  Italian two-year note yields climbed one basis point to
3.20 percent after touching 3.37 percent. The rate on similar-
maturity Spanish debt also advanced one basis point, to 3.86
percent, after dropping more than 1.4 percentage points in the
days following Draghi’s announcement.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index tumbled 0.1 percent amid concern
the euro crisis is eating into corporate earnings. ING reported
second-quarter net income of 1.17 billion euros, missing analyst
estimates of 1.26 billion euros. Securitas had net income of 337
million kronor ($50.3 million), trailing the average forecast of
422 million kronor.  Greek Outlook  The yield on the Greek bond due February 2023 slid 32 basis
points to 24.28 percent, with the price climbing to 19.84
percent of face value.  The change of outlook on  Greece ’s CCC rating, eight levels
below investment grade, reflects the risk of a downgrade if the
nation is unable to obtain its next disbursement of bailout
loans from the European Union and International Monetary Fund
rescue package, S&P said yesterday in a statement.  German debt returned 2.9 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities fell 4.1 percent, while Italy’s debt rose 9.2
percent, the gauge showed.  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by the Finland and Germany according to
measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two-year and 10-
year securities and credit-default swaps. The Dutch 10-year
yield slipped five basis points to 1.73 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
