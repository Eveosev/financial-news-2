Telecom Egypt Co. (ETEL) , the Arab country’s
monopoly fixed-line phone company, said second-quarter profit
dropped 25 percent from a year earlier as it didn’t deliver any
submarine cable projects.  Net income  fell to 613 million pounds ($101 million) from
813 million pounds in the same period last year, the company
said in a statement distributed by the Regulatory News Service.
That missed the 786 million-pound average of four  analyst
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Wholesale-service revenue, the biggest contributer to the
company’s income, was 1.24 billion pounds. The company didn’t
give a comparative figure for last year, saying it declined
because of “no new project deliveries during the period in the
submarine cable projects business, a revenue stream which has
always been uneven.”  Investment in infrastructure declined to 125 million pounds
from 205 million a year earlier, leaving the company with 4
billion pounds of cash.  The results were “somewhat resilient” considering the
political and economic unrest in  Egypt , Shorouk Diab,
telecommunications analyst at Cairo-based Pharos Holding, wrote
in a research note. They are “largely demonstrating how the
company’s fairly diverse business model has served to maintain
overall performance in a tough operating environment.”  The shares  dropped 1.6 percent, the most in almost a month,
to 12.87 pounds at the close in Cairo. The stock has lost 2.6
percent this year compared with a 38 percent increase for the
benchmark  EGX 30 Index. (EGX30)   To contact the reporter on this story:
