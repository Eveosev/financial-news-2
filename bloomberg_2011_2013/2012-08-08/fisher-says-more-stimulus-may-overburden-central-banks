Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President  Richard Fisher  said adequate economic stimulus is in
place and that global central banks may not have the capacity to
undertake additional measures.  “We’re at the risk of overburdening the central banks,”
Fisher said in an interview today on “Bloomberg Surveillance”
with  Tom Keene  and Sara Eisen. “We keep applying what I call 
monetary Ritalin to the system. We all know there’s a risk 
of over-prescribing.”  Fisher said the largest banks have $1.5 trillion in excess
reserves that they would like to put to work and that the
private sector now must take the next steps to boost growth.
Lawmakers also must act to eliminate uncertainty about
 government spending  and tax rates, Fisher said.  “We have done our job,” Fisher said of the Fed. “We have
done enough. Just doing more doesn’t solve the problem. The
problem is engaging the transmission. We provided the gas, the
gas tank is full.”  The Dallas Fed chief isn’t a voting member of the 
policy-making Federal Open Market Committee this year. He 
dissented last year twice against moves to push down long-term 
rates and to keep the benchmark U.S. interest rate near zero 
until at least mid-2013. He voted five times in 2008 in favor 
of tighter policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
