Turkish banks submitted proposals to
 Astaldi SpA (AST)  of Italy and its local partner, Ictas Insaat Sanayi
Ticaret AS, to finance construction of a third bridge over the
Bosporus in Istanbul,  Star  reported.  Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN) , a state-run bank, is among
those submitting proposals, the newspaper said, without saying
where it got the information. Suleyman Kalkan, Vakifbankâ€™s chief
executive officer, said last week the bank wants to finance the
bridge, Star added.  The Astaldi-Ictas partnership is in talks with five groups
of banks on the project, which includes building and operating
the bridge and connecting roads, Star said, without giving a
figure for the amount of financing needed.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
