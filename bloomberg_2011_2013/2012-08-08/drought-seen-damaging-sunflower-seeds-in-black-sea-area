Dry and hot weather in July and early
August will lead to a reduced sunflower harvest in the Black Sea
countries, according to  UkrAgroConsult .  The Kiev-based agriculture researcher lowered its harvest
estimate about 10 percent to 19 million metric tons from 21
million tons forecast in June, according to an e-mailed
statement. UkrAgroConsult may cut its forecast further should
the heat persist.  The Black Sea countries -- Russia, Ukraine, Romania,
Bulgaria and  Kazakhstan  -- reaped a record sunflower seed
harvest of 22.5 million tons last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
