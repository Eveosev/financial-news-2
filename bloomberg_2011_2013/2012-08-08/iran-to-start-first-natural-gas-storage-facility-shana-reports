Iran  will officially start a natural
gas storage facility in its central Qom province, the first in
the  Middle East , the Oil Ministry said.  The Sarajeh site, which consists of nine wells, will store
1.5 billion cubic meters (53 billion cubic feet) of gas during
summer months and supply some 4 million cubic meters of fuel a
day to the national network in winter, according to a report
published yesterday by the Oil Ministryâ€™s news agency,  Shana ,
citing National Iranian Gas Co. Managing Director Javad Owji
said in the report.  Iran announced plans in April to increase its storage
capacity for natural gas to 14 billion cubic meters by the end
of 2015. Sarajeh is one of three projects that will allow Iran
to store underground some 8 billion cubic meters of natural gas,
Massoud Samivand, the managing director of Natural Gas Storage
