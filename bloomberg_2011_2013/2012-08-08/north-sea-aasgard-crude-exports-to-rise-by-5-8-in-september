Daily exports of North Sea Aasgard
crude in September will increase by 5.8 percent from August, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The schedule comprises six cargoes of 855,000 barrels each
and one shipment of 1 million barrels, totaling 204,333 barrels
a day, the plan showed. This compares with seven lots of 855,000
barrels amounting to 193,065 barrels a day in August.  Loadings of Grane will drop to four shipments of 600,000
barrels, two less than August, according to a separate plan.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil company, operates the two
fields. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
