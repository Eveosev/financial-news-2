The Panama Canal Authority said it
will raise shipping tolls as it nears completion of a $5.25
billion expansion to accommodate larger vessels.  The Canal Authority said the higher fees will take effect
in October, according to an e-mailed statement today from the
waterway’s operator.  Ship owners representing 80 percent of the world’s fleet
had called for delaying the increase, claiming that a 15 percent
toll raise  was “excessive,” the International Chamber of
Shipping said on May 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
