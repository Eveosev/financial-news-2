U.S. regulators are seeking a $1
million fine against  Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK) ’s Horizon Air for
making more than 186,000 flights on aircraft with rivets that
can damage other equipment.  Horizon made the flights from Dec. 1, 2007, to June 1,
2011, before replacing the rivets on  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  DHC-8-402
turboprop planes, the  Federal Aviation Administration  said today
in an e-mailed statement.  “We expect airlines to comply with all of our safety
regulations and to correct safety defects promptly,” U.S.
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in the release.  Horizon made 22 flights with one of the planes after being
told it didn’t comply with regulations, according to the agency
statement.  The rivets damaged wiring on one plane, according to an
Aug. 1 letter to Seattle-based Horizon from the FAA that was
released by the agency.  The rivets were used by Horizon to install hardened cockpit
doors required to prevent terrorists from seizing control from
pilots, the FAA said in its release.  The airline used so-called blind rivets, which are pounded
into a surface and can damage components, the agency said. The
violations occurred on 22 aircraft.  Airlines often contest FAA fines and end up paying less
than the agency proposes.  Horizon, which discovered the issue and reported it to FAA,
doesn’t believe that the rivets compromised safety or the
integrity of the doors, Bobbie Egan, an Alaska Air spokeswoman,
said in an interview.  “As soon as the FAA expressed concerns, we took immediate
action to inspect the rest of our fleet,” Egan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
