NTPC Ltd. (NTPC) ,  India ’s largest power
producer, will announce this month a plan to sell $1 billion of
bonds overseas for capacity expansion, following the nation’s
worst electricity crisis last week.  The medium-term notes will help finance capital
investments, Chairman Arup Roy Choudhury told reporters in New
Delhi yesterday, without elaborating. The company has raised
$800 million since 2006 by selling medium-term notes.  A blackout across the north and east of India last week
left more than 640 million people without electricity, halted
trains and caused traffic jams. Shortages of coal and natural
gas have stalled power projects, making lenders cautious,
according to Ashok Khurana, director general at the Association
of Power Producers.  About 70 percent of NTPC’s planned investments will be
funded through debt, Choudhury said. While the company aims to
increase its generation capacity by 30 percent to 51,052
megawatts by March 2017, the utility has yet to start building
projects with almost 11,000 megawatts of capacity because of a
lack of assured coal supplies, he said.  NTPC will also develop coal mines in the country to produce
37 million metric tons of the fuel annually by the year ending
March 31, 2017, Choudhury said. The company will buy all the 164
million tons of coal needed to fire its plants in this fiscal
year.  The utility raised $500 million selling 5.625 percent
dollar-denominated notes at 255 basis points more than U.S.
Treasuries in July 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield on the notes fell one basis point to 5.22
percent today, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices.  NTPC  shares  rose 0.8 percent to 168.65 rupees at 10:44 a.m.
in Mumbai. The stock has gained 4.8 percent this year, compared
with a 14 percent increase in the benchmark  Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
