Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to an almost one-year low, on speculation the central
bank will cut borrowing costs further this year and as investors
bought short-term securities to replace notes that mature this
month.  The yield on the government’s 6 percent peso-denominated
debt due in April 2013 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.14 percent, according to the central
bank. That’s the lowest level on a closing basis since
September. The price rose 0.02 centavo to 100.537 centavos per
peso.  The government will pay about 6 trillion pesos ($3.4
billion) this month in interest payments and principal on its
bonds coming due Aug. 15, according to Eduardo Bolanos, an
analyst at Asesores en Valores brokerage in Bogota. Yields on
the bonds due April 2013 have fallen 22 basis points since the
central bank unexpectedly cut the  overnight lending rate  by a
quarter-percentage point to 5 percent on July 27.  “With inflation under control, the market is pricing in at
least one more rate cut this year,” Bolanos said. “A large
part of the liquidity entering the market will likely go into
the shorter end of the bond curve.”  Annual inflation  slowed to 3.03 percent, according to an
Aug. 4 government report, within the central bank’s 2 percent to
4 percent target range.  Banco de la Republica will lower the key rate to 4.75
percent by year-end, Bolanos predicts.  Borrowing Costs  Colombia’s borrowing costs fell at an auction today of
fixed-rate securities. The government sold debt due August 2026
to yield 6.76 percent, the  Finance Ministry  said in a statement,
down from 6.85 percent at the last auction on July 25.  Colombia also sold bonds due May 2022 to yield 6.53
percent, down from 6.7 percent, while the yield on the June 2016
securities fell to 5.43 percent from 5.76 percent, according to
the statement.  The peso was little changed at 1,787.05 per  U.S. dollar . It
has gained 8.5 percent this year, the best performance after the
Chilean peso among the six most traded Latin American
currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
