Anhanguera Educacional Participacoes
SA (AEDU3) , Brazil’s largest education company by market value, rose the
most in 10 weeks after reporting that second-quarter profit
tripled.  Shares gained 3.6 percent to 30.25 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the steepest one-day advance since May 29.
The Bovespa Small Cap index jumped 1.4 percent.  Adjusted net income climbed to 24.6 million reais ($12.2
million) in the three months through June from 8.02 million
reais a year ago, Anhanguera said in a regulatory filing today.
Analysts had expected a profit of 20.6 million reais, according
to the average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expected Anhanguera to report solid results as the
number of students rose, but this income increase came above our
forecast,” Luis Fernando Azevedo, an analyst at investment bank
Bradesco BBI, said by telephone from  Sao Paulo .  Anhanguera has gained 50 percent this year while the
Bovespa Small Cap index rose 14 percent in the same period.
Competitor  Kroton Educacional SA (KROT3)  surge 70 percent and  Estacio
Participacoes SA (ESTC3)  added 47 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
