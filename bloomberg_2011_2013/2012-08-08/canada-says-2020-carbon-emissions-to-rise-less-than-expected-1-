Canada  said its greenhouse-gas
emissions by 2020 will be lower than forecast due to
improvements in efficiency by industry and consumers.  Greenhouse gas emissions are projected to reach 720
megatonnes in 2020, 65 megatonnes lower than forecast, the
federal environment department said in a report released today
on its website.  Canada has said it will reduce its emissions by 17 percent
below 2005 levels by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
