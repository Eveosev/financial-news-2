Manila Water  Co., which supplies
water to half of the Philippine capital, said first-half net
income increased 31 percent to 2.63 billion pesos ($63 million)
from a year earlier on higher billing volume.  Revenue rose 24 percent as the total billed water volume
increased 36 percent, the utility said today in a stock exchange
filing. The company, a unit of  Ayala Corp. (AC) , didnâ€™t provide
second-quarter figures. The stock closed unchanged at 25.95
pesos.  Manila Water on July 20 said it had acquired through its
Singapore unit a 47 percent stake in the Vietnamese water
distributor Kenh Dong Water Supply Joint Stock Co. The utility
bought 49 percent of Thu Duc Water BOO Corp. last November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
