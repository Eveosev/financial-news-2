Most  Hong Kong   stocks  fell, with the
city’s benchmark index headed for its first loss in three days,
ahead of reports expected to show the world’s second-largest
economy is slowing. Losses were limited on speculation slowing
inflation may give more room for further monetary easing.  China  Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. fell 2 percent, after
a report that China can expand property controls if prices
rebound. Shanghai Electric Group Co. paced gains among utilities
after reporting a rise in profit.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) ,
Asia’s biggest international carrier, fell 4.3 percent after
posting an unexpected first-half loss. Apparel retailer  Esprit
Holdings Ltd. (330)  slumped 12 percent as Barclays Plc advised selling
the shares after they rallied the most in 14 years yesterday.  The Hang Seng Index fell 7.03 points, or less than 0.1
percent to 20,065.52 as of the 4 p.m. close in Hong Kong after
rising as much as 0.6 percent. About three stocks dropped for
every two that rose on the broader Hang Seng Composite Index.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
climbed 0.2 percent to 9,867.76.  The economy is “slowing down, and that’s what the
government wants because the economy at one stage was going too
fast, causing inflationary pressures,” said Khiem Do, the Hong
Kong-based head of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset
Management (Asia) Ltd., which oversees about $8 billion. “From
low to cheap valuations, Asian equities are again in favor for
foreign investors.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 10 percent from this year’s low in
June through today after  Europe  eased terms for banking bailouts
and on optimism policy makers around the world will deploy more
stimulus to spur growth. The  value  of shares on the gauge has
risen to 10.6 times estimated earnings on average, compared with
13.6 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.6 for Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  China Inflation  Consumer prices in China may have risen 1.7 percent in July
from a year earlier after climbing 2.2 percent in June,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before the government releases the data tomorrow.
Reports on industrial production and retail sales are due the
same day. A commentary in the Financial News said recent
moderation in China’s inflation gives “bigger” room for
monetary policy.  China Overseas Land & Investment slid 2.8 percent to
HK$17.54.  Country Garden Holdings Co. (2007) , a real estate developer,
dropped 0.7 percent to HK$3.00.  China will be able to expand property market controls if
 home prices  rebound, Shanghai Securities News reported today,
citing an unidentified ministry official.  Futures, Volatility  Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell less than 0.1 percent
to 20,006. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  added 0.6 percent to 19.090,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.5 percent in the
benchmark index during the next 30 days.  Shanghai Electric advanced 4.6 percent to HK$3.40 after
saying its first-half profit increased 67 percent from a year
earlier to 305.6 million  yuan  ($48 million). China Power
International Development Ltd. gained 3.4 percent to HK$2.12.
Huaneng Power International Inc. advanced 1 percent to HK$5.13.  Esprit slumped 12 percent to HK$11.20 after Barclays
analyst Vineet Sharma wrote in a note to clients that
fundamentals surrounding the company haven’t changed. The stock

named a new chief executive officer.  Cathay Pacific Airways dropped 4.3 percent to HK$12.36
after posting a first-half loss of HK$935 million ($121
million), swinging from a profit of HK$2.8 billion a year
earlier.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.1 percent today. The gauge
