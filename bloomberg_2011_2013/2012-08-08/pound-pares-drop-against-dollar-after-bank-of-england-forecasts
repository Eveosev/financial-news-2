The pound pared its decline against
the dollar after the  Bank of England  cut its growth forecast and
said inflation will be below its target in two years.  Sterling was 0.1 percent lower at $1.5605 at 10:34 a.m.
London time, after dropping as much as 0.3 percent earlier.
Britainâ€™s currency was little changed at 79.30 pence per euro.  U.K. 10-year gilts extended their advance, with the yield
falling six basis points to 1.54 percent.  Short-sterling futures stayed higher, with the implied
yield on the contract expiring in September 2013 two basis
points lower at 0.54 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
