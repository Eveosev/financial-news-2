  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ,  Africa ’s largest
mobile-phone operator, reported first-half earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates as increasing competition and an economic
slowdown weighed on results.  Adjusted earnings per share advanced to 5.37 rand from 4.70
rand a year earlier, Johannesburg-based MTN said today in a
statement. That missed the 5.91-rand median of two analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose to 66.4 billion
rand ($8.18 billion) from 56.54 billion rand.  “Market conditions continued to be impacted by increasing
levels of competition, regulatory requirements, political unrest
in certain countries and the global economic slowdown,” MTN
said.  First-half subscriber numbers gained 6.9 percent to 176
million users. MTN, which operates in 22 African and Middle
Eastern markets, said revenue growth was enhanced by the rand’s
and Nigerian naira’s declines versus the dollar.  The company is upgrading networks to so-called third-
generation technology to handle more data traffic as consumers
seek Internet connections on their mobile devices. Data
services, excluding  text messages , contributed 10 percent of
group revenue, said the company.  Stock Falls  The stock  fell  0.5 percent to 153 rand at the close in
Johannesburg, bringing the company’s market value to 288.4
billion rand.  MTN’s first-half capital spending was 10.1 billion rand as
the phone operator expanded 3G mobile technology. “Although
capital expenditure increased when compared to the corresponding
period for 2011, the rate of capex is expected to accelerate in
the second half of the year,” MTN said.  The company decided to increase its dividend payout to 72
percent of earnings from 70 percent. MTN said it plans an
interim  dividend  of 3.21 rand a share. The company spent 2.09
billion rand buying back its shares in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sikonathi Mantshantsha in
