Old Mutual Plc (OML) , the U.K.’s  third-
largest  insurer by market value, said first-half profit gained
26 percent on growth in southern Africa.  Net income rose to 931 million pounds ($1.45 billion), from
738 million pounds a year earlier, the London-based insurer said
today in a statement. Adjusted operating earnings per share fell
7.4 percent to 8.7 pence, missing the 9.1 pence median estimate
of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Uncertainty about the euro has “affected  consumer
confidence ” and “the U.K. market has also been impacted,” Old
Mutual Chief Executive Officer Julian Roberts said in the
statement. The company is “expanding in attractive African
markets; introducing new products across the group,” he said.  Old Mutual, Africa’s largest insurer, has operations in
Europe, the U.K. and  South Africa . The company, recovering from
two years of losses linked to hedging failures in 2008 and
writedowns of investments, is seeking to pay off 1.5 billion
pounds of debt by the end of this year, another 200 million
pounds next, and achieve a return on equity of 15 percent.  While the asset management unit has seen increased
investment in the first half, “in the second quarter, the very
volatile conditions saw clients taking a conservative approach
to  asset allocation  and awarding new mandates,” Roberts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
