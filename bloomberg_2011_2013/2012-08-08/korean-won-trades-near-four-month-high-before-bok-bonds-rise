South  Korea ’s won was little changed
near a four-month high as investors refrained from betting
strongly on the currency’s direction ahead of the central bank’s
rate decision tomorrow.  Government bonds  advanced as some economists forecast
borrowing costs will be cut. Ten out of 16  surveyed  by Bloomberg
forecast the benchmark rate will stay at 3.25 percent, while the
rest forecast a 25 basis point cut. The  Bank of Korea 
unexpectedly lowered borrowing costs for the first time in more
than three years last month. Economic indicators show growth is
slowing and policies will be focused on spurring domestic
demand, Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said at a meeting in Seoul
today.  “We didn’t see aggressive bets on one position today as
the rate meeting is coming up,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a Seoul-
based currency analyst for Samsung Futures Inc. “There was some
dollar selling as the Kospi Index rose, but importers buying the
greenback to settle bills limited currency gains.” The  Kospi
Index (KOSPI)  rose 0.9 percent.  The won closed at 1,128.30 per dollar in Seoul, from
1,128.78 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It touched
1,124 on Aug. 6, the strongest level since April 3. One-month
implied volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, to 7.08 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 fell two basis points to 2.76 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. Three-year debt futures advanced 0.04 to 106.30 and
the one-year interest-rate swap rose two basis points to 2.83
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
