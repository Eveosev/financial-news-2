Gabon, Central Africa’s third-biggest
oil producer, is planning to boost exploration and production of
natural gas, according to the Mining Ministry.  The country has more than 39 billion cubic meters of gas
deposits, the ministry said in a statement handed to reporters
in Libreville, the capital, today.  The government will create a plan “to determine the most
pertinent usage of this economic potential and to encourage the
exploration and production of natural gas,” it said. It will
exclude “gas associated with oil reserves,” according to the
statement.  A natural gas-fired power plant, which has a 35-megawatt
capacity, may be expanded to 70 megawatts, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
