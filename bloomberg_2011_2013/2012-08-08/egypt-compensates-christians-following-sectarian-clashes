Egypt ’s government will give 10,000
Egyptian pounds ($1,645) as compensation to each Christian
family that fled the site of sectarian clashes last month in
which a citizen was killed, the independent Al-Shorouk newspaper
reported, citing President Mohamed Mursi’s legal adviser.  A million-pound charity project will also be set up to
serve residents of Dahshour, south of Cairo, and will be named
after Mo’aaz Hassan, the 25-year-old who died in the clashes in
late July, Al-Shorouk cited Mohammed Gadallah as saying. The
nature and supervision of the project will be left to Hassan’s
father to decide, Gadallah said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
