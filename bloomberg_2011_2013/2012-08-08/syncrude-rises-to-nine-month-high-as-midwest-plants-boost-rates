Syncrude oil from  Alberta  surged to
the widest premium over West Texas Intermediate in nine months
as U.S. Midwest refiners operated near full capacity for the
second consecutive week.  Refiners in the Midwest region operated at 97.6 percent of
capacity in the week ended Aug. 3, according to the Energy
Department. That’s down from 98.9 percent the previous week. A
year ago plants ran at 93.9 percent.  “The biggest contributor is the high utilization,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Syncrude gained $3.15 to $6.40 over WTI at 2:26 p.m. in  New
York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
largest premium for the grade since Nov. 2. Syncrude is a
synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like bitumen in Alberta into
refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed $2 to $13.75 a
barrel below WTI, the narrowest margin since July 17. Bakken
oil’s discount was steady at $2.50 a barrel below the U.S.
benchmark.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast, most grades strengthened. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark widened 25 cents
to $17.25 a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet’s decreased 45 cents
to $17.35.  Poseidon’s premium added 5 cents to $12.30, while Southern
Green Canyon’s decreased 25 cents to $11.25 a barrel over WTI.
Mars Blend’s premium lost 10 cents to $12.90.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
was steady at $16.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
