The following is the text of the U.S. productivity and
costs report for the second quarter released by the Labor Department.  Nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased at a 1.6 percent annual
rate during the second quarter of 2012, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported
today. The increase in productivity reflects increases of 2.0 percent in output and
0.4 percent in hours worked. (All quarterly percent changes in this release are
seasonally adjusted annual rates.) From the second quarter of 2011 to the second
quarter of 2012, productivity increased 1.1 percent as output and hours worked rose
2.9 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.  Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by dividing an index of
real output by an index of hours worked of all persons, including employees,
proprietors, and unpaid family workers.  Unit labor costs in nonfarm businesses increased 1.7 percent in the second
quarter of 2012, while hourly compensation increased 3.3 percent. Unit labor costs
rose 0.8 percent over the last four quarters.  Data in this release reflect the regular multi-year revision to the National Income
and Product Accounts (NIPA) released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S.
Department of Commerce on July 27, 2012. See Revised measures.  BLS defines unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly compensation to  labor
productivity ; increases in hourly compensation tend to increase unit labor costs and
increases in output per hour tend to reduce them.  Manufacturing sector productivity rose 0.2 percent in the second quarter of
2012, as output grew 1.7 percent and hours worked increased 1.4 percent. Over the
last four quarters, manufacturing productivity increased 2.9 percent, as output
increased 5.6 percent and hours rose 2.6 percent. Unit labor costs in manufacturing
rose 0.3 percent in the second quarter of 2012 and decreased 2.9 percent from the
same quarter a year ago.  Revised first-quarter 2012 measures of productivity and costs were announced
for the nonfinancial corporate sector. Productivity increased 1.2 percent in the
first quarter of 2012, as output and hours rose 4.7 percent and 3.4 percent,
respectively.  The concepts, sources, and methods used for the manufacturing and nonfinancial
corporate output series differ from those used in the business and nonfarm business
output series; these output measures are not directly comparable. See Technical
Notes for a more detailed explanation.  Revised measures  Measures of output for the business, nonfarm business, and nonfinancial
corporate (NFC) sectors, and compensation for all sectors incorporate the revised
National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) data released on July 27 by the  Bureau
of Economic Analysis , U.S. Department of Commerce.  As a result, output was revised
back to the first quarter of 2009 for the business, nonfarm business, and NFC
sectors.  Compensation was subject to revisions back to the first quarter of 2008
for the business and nonfarm business sectors, and back to the first quarter of 2009
for the manufacturing and NFC sectors. Furthermore, hours were subject to revisions
back to the first quarter of 2008 for the business, nonfarm business, and NFC
sectors, due to revised NIPA data on compensation of all employees and employment in
government enterprises. Measures of manufacturing output were revised back to 1987
to reflect revised output indexes constructed by BLS using data from the U.S.
Department of Commerce; manufacturing hours were revised back to the first quarter
of 2012.  As a result of the revisions, productivity and related measures were revised in
the business, nonfarm business, and NFC sectors back to the first quarter of 2008.
In the manufacturing sector, productivity and related measures were subject to
revisions back to 1987.  Table B presents previous and revised productivity and related measures for the
nonfarm business, business, and manufacturing sectors for the first quarter of 2012
and table C presents annual data for nonfarm business and total manufacturing from
2009 to 2011. Table D presents revised and previous measures for nonfinancial
corporations for the first quarter of 2012, in addition to annual data from 2009 to
2011. Revised quarterly and annual series for recent years appear in tables 1-6 and
in appendix tables 1-6. Full historical annual and quarterly measures can be found
on the productivity and costs home page  http://www.bls.gov/lpc/#data .  In the first quarter of 2012, nonfarm business productivity declined 0.5
percent, a smaller decline than reported in the preliminary estimate. The revised
figure reflects an upward revision to output and a slight downward revision to hours.
Unit labor costs grew 5.6 percent in the first quarter, due primarily to a large
upward revision to hourly compensation. In the manufacturing sector, productivity
growth in the first quarter was 5.5 percent, as output growth was revised up and
hours were revised down. Unit labor costs declined 0.4 percent, rather than
decreasing 4.9 percent as previously reported.  For the year 2011, nonfarm business productivity growth was 0.7 percent, an
upward revision from the previous estimate of 0.4 percent. (See table C.) Unit labor
costs increased 2.0 percent, a larger increase than reported June 6. Manufacturing
productivity increased at the same 2.5 percent rate that was reported previously.
The 0.1 percent increase in unit labor costs was more than the 1.0 percent decline
published June 6, due to an upward revision to hourly compensation.  For the year 2010, nonfarm business productivity growth was revised down to 3.1
percent from the previous estimate of 4.0 percent due to a downward revision in
output. Unit labor costs declined 1.0 percent, a smaller decline than reported June
6. Manufacturing productivity increased 6.4 percent, slightly less than reported
previously. The 5.0 percent decline in unit labor costs was more than the 4.7
percent decline published June 6.  For the year 2009, nonfarm business productivity growth was 2.9 percent, as the
decline in output was less than previously reported. Unit labor costs showed a
decline of 1.5 percent, after revision. In manufacturing, productivity grew 0.1
percent, rather than 0.5 percent. Unit labor costs were not revised, increasing 4.0
percent.  Over the most recent ten-year period (2001-2011) nonfarm business productivity
increased at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent. Manufacturing productivity grew
at an annual average rate of 3.3 percent.  In the nonfinancial corporate sector, first-quarter 2012 productivity growth
was 1.2 percent; the preliminary estimate was 0.3 percent. For the years 2011 and
2010, productivity growth was greater than previously reported, due to an upward
revision in output.  The revised Productivity and Costs press release for second-quarter 2012 is
scheduled to be released on Wednesday, September 5, 2012 at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).
