Nigeria ’s Kogi state imposed a curfew
on the town of Okene after a second day of attacks by gunmen
that left three people dead, a government spokesman said.  Gunmen fired on worshipers gathering for evening prayers in
the town’s main mosque late yesterday, killing two soldiers on
guard and a civilian, Jacob Edi, the spokesman for Kogi Governor
Idris Wada, said by phone today from the state capital, Lokoja.
This prompted the governor to introduce a curfew, he said.  At least 17 people were killed and eight wounded when
gunmen fired on people at a church in Okene on Aug. 6.  In another incident today, unknown gunmen ambushed police
officers on patrol in northeastern Bauchi state, killing two
inspectors, Muhammed Ladan, the police state commissioner, said
by phone.  The incidents are the latest in a spate of gun and bomb
attacks in the mainly Muslim north and central parts of  Africa ’s
top oil producer that have killed hundreds of people since 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
