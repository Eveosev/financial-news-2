Investors suing banks over Libor rate
manipulation may refer to last month’s settlement involving
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  as they seek to fend off the banks’ requests to
dismiss the claims, a  Manhattan  federal judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan today
told lawyers that she won’t delay a motion to dismiss claims
that the banks violated U.S. antitrust law by suppressing the
Libor rate, which is used to set interest rates on trillions of
dollars of investments.  The investors, led by the mayor and city council of
Baltimore, had asked Buchwald to delay the motions to dismiss
and allow them to file an amended complaint including
information that has become public as a result of the Barclays’
settlement.  “Ours is a landscape of shifting sands,” said Buchwald,
referring to regulatory investigations into the alleged Libor
manipulation and the desire of additional plaintiffs to join the
litigation.  Buchwald, who is overseeing federal antitrust litigation
over Libor, said she will put a hold on new suits that aren’t
covered by the motion to dismiss.  The case is In re: LIBOR-Based Financial Instruments
Antitrust Litigation, 11-MD-2262, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
