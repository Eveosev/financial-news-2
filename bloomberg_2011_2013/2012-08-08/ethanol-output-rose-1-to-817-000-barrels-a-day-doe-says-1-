Ethanol  production  in the U.S. rose 1
percent last week to 817,000 barrels a day, the highest level
since July 6, the Energy Department said.  Output increased in consecutive weeks for the first time
since the period ended June 8. Stockpiles shrank 3.9 percent to
18.7 million barrels, the steepest decline since Dec. 9 and the
lowest amount since Dec. 30, the agency said today in its weekly

measure of consumption beyond whatâ€™s mandated by the government,
increased 1.5 percent to 5.46 million barrels a day, according
to the department.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 0.8 cent to
$2.564 a gallon at 11:15 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
