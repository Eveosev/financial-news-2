Stryker Corp. (SYK) ’s Wingspan brain stent
will be limited to use by a smaller group of patients than U.S.
regulators initially approved and the device will now require
post-market monitoring, U.S. regulators said.  The stent used to open severely narrowed arteries in the
brain is being restricted to patients who have had recurring
strokes despite medical management and haven’t had new stroke
symptoms within seven days before treatment with Wingspan, the
 Food and Drug Administration  said today in a  statement .  The FDA cited data collected since approving the device in
2005 that suggest some patients using Wingspan may have a
greater risk of stroke and death than those attempting medical
management. The stent, used in fewer than 4,000 people in the
U.S. each year, is meant to help prevent strokes caused by
reduced blood flow to the brain.  “Patient benefit is an important factor in agency
decision-making,”  Jeffrey Shuren , director of the FDA’s Center
for Devices and Radiological Health, said in the statement.
“After careful consideration of available safety information,
the FDA believes this device should remain available for this
specific subgroup of patients who have exhausted other
options.”  Stryker fell less than 1 percent to $52.99 at the close of
 New York  trading.  The FDA had approved Wingspan under a humanitarian device
exemption that requires Kalamazoo, Michigan-based Stryker to
prove the product doesn’t cause significant risk of illness or
injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
