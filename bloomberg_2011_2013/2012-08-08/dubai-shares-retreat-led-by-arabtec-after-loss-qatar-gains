Dubai’s benchmark stock index fell to
the lowest in almost a week after  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC)  reported a
second-quarter loss that missed analysts’ estimates. Qatari
shares advanced after  Industries Qatar (IQCD) ’s profit rose.  Shares of Arabtec, the biggest construction company in the
 United Arab Emirates , decreased 4 percent.  Emaar Properties
PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper, declined for
a third day. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  fell 0.1 percent to 1,555.65
at the close in the emirate, the lowest since Aug. 2, taking the
past three day’s drop to 1.3 percent. Qatar’s QE Index increased
0.4 percent, while the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  rose 0.1 percent.  Arabtec, which has the third-heaviest weighting on the
stock gauge, said today the loss attributable to owners of the
parent was 11.6 million dirhams ($3.2 million) after a profit of
29 million dirhams a year earlier. The  average estimate  of six
analysts was for a profit of 73 million dirhams, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares fell the most since May
13 to 2.9 dirhams, trimming this year’s rally to 92 percent.  “The market is reacting to Arabtec’s loss,” said Nabil Rantisi, managing director of brokerage at Abu Dhabi-based
Menacorp. “The company has landed new projects, but hasn’t
monetized them yet.”  Arabtec said in June that along with TAV Insaat of  Turkey 
and others it won a contract valued at about $3 billion to build
a terminal at  Abu Dhabi  Airport. Abu Dhabi government-controlled
Aabar Investments PJSC raised its stake in Dubai-based Arabtec
this year to 21.6 percent, prompting a surge in the shares.  Oil Drops  About 119 million shares traded in Dubai today, compared
with a 12-month daily average of about 139 million. The Islamic
holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset
and business activity slows, is under way.  Emaar dropped 0.9 percent to 3.35 dirhams, the lowest since
July 29.  Oil slid from the highest close in more than two months as
investors sold contracts on speculation that recent gains were
excessive amid signs of weakening demand in the U.S, the world’s
biggest consumer of crude. Crude for September delivery
decreased as much as 0.9 percent to $92.82 a barrel by 8:34 a.m.
in  New York . Gulf Arab oil exporters, including Qatar and the
U.A.E., supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  rose to 8,402.19, the highest since May.
Industries Qatar, the country’s second-biggest company by market
value, advanced 1.4 percent to 137.4 riyals after second-quarter
profit climbed about 3 percent, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on first-half results provided by the
company.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI) , Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  and
Kuwait’s  gauge  advanced 0.1 percent.  Saudi Arabia (SABIC) ’s Tadawul All
Share Index lost 0.1 percent, trimming the gain for the week to
0.9 percent. Neighboring Bahrain’s  benchmark stock index  tumbled
1.5 percent today to 1,074.68, the lowest level since at least
July 2004 when Bloomberg started tracking the gauge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
