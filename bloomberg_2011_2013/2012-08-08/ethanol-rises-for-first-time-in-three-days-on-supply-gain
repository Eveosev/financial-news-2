Ethanol futures rose for the first
time in three days in  Chicago  after a government report showed
stockpiles fell the most this year.  Futures increased after the Energy Department said
 inventories  declined 3.9 percent last week to 18.7 million
barrels, the steepest drop on a percentage basis since Dec. 9.
It was the lowest level since Dec. 30.  “We got a good draw,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at
Linn Group in Chicago. “Overall, it was a fairly positive
report. I’m surprised we’re not higher on ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery gained 0.6 cent to
$2.578 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
advanced 17 percent this year.  Ethanol  production  rose 1 percent last week to 817,000
barrels a day, the most since July 6, the Energy Department
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
