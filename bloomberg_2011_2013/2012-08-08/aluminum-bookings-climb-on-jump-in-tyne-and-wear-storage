Orders to withdraw aluminum from
warehouses approved by the London Metal Exchange climbed the
most in almost two months on bookings in Tyne and Wear,
northeastern  England .  The  orders , known as canceled warrants, rose for the first
time in nine sessions, climbing 67,600 metric tons, or 4
percent, the most since June 14, to 1.75 million tons, exchange
data showed today. A total of 47,700 tons were canceled in Tyne
and Wear, where 83 percent of inventories now await delivery.  “Given the rather subdued state of the U.K. economy, it
will be interesting to see what happens to those units, if
anything,”  Leon Westgate , an analyst at Standard Bank Plc in
London, said today in a report.  Aluminum inventories fell 0.1 percent to 4.87 million tons.
Stockpiles in Tyne and Wear are down 5 percent at 57,575 tons
this year and represent 1.2 percent of global inventories of the
lightweight metal. All six LME-approved storage points in the
area are operated by NEMS Ltd., a warehouse company owned by
Trafigura Beheer BV.  Exchange data also showed today a total of 22,000 tons of
aluminum were booked for delivery at the Dutch port of
Vlissingen, bringing the total number of orders there to 841,225
tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
