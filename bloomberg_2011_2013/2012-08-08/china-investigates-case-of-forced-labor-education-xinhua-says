Central  China ’s  Hunan province will
probe a case in which a petitioning mother was sent to labor
camp, Xinhua News Agency said, citing Liu Xianhua, head of the
investigation team of the provincial Communist Party Political
and Legislative Affairs Committee.  Tang Hui, 39, of Yongzhou city, was sentenced to 18 months
of labor re-education on Aug. 2 for publicly voicing
dissatisfaction with the handling of a trial involving the
kidnap, rape and forced prostitution of her then 11-year-old
daughter in 2006, Xinhua said, citing the local public security
bureau.  While Tang had sought death penalty for all seven people
charged, the provincial court in June sentenced two of them to
be executed, Xinhua said. Tang’s case attracted more than
700,000 posts on Sina’s Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social
network, with most of them expressing sympathy for her and
appealing for justice, Xinhua said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
