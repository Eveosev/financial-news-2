VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  shares fell the
most in more than two months after  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the largest
coffee-shop chain, said it will use Square Inc.’s rival payment-
system technology in 7,000 stores.  VeriFone, based in  San Jose , California, declined 11
percent to $34.52 at 1 p.m. in New York, for the biggest drop
since May 25. The stock had fallen 29 percent from its 52-week
high in April through yesterday.  Square will process Starbucks credit and debit card
transactions in the U.S. and provide a mobile payment
application for Starbucks customers. The Seattle-based coffee
chain will invest $25 million in the startup, and Starbucks
Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  will join Square’s board,
the companies  said  today.  VeriFone, which is the largest maker of credit-card
terminals, competes with Square in the fast-growing market for
payments made via mobile phones and tablets. Both companies make
accessories and software that let merchants accept credit and
debit cards via mobile devices. The market for the micro-
merchant processing may reach $1 billion in 2016, up from $30
million last year, according to Aite Group LLC.  John Williams , a UBS Securities LLC analyst, downgraded
VeriFone’s shares to neutral from buy yesterday, citing growing
competition from Square.  Although VeriFone has introduced similar products,
“innovation and lower prices will win out -- meaning the new
competitors will likely pose a legitimate threat to the status
quo in payment hardware and services over the next several
years,” Williams said in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
