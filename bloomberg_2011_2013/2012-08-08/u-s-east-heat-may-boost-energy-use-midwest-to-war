About 10 percent more energy will be
needed to cool homes and businesses along the U.S. East Coast
until Aug. 15 as temperatures linger just above normal, said
 David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  Temperatures are expected to stay 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit
(1.7 to 2.2 Celsius) above normal through Aug. 22, according to
MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  In the Midwest, seasonal temperatures this week will
probably be replaced by another round of heat next week, MDA
said. Temperatures may rise 5 to 7 degrees above normal across
the region from Aug. 13-22.  Natural gas futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  have risen 53 percent since dropping to a 10-year low
in April as higher-than-normal temperatures helped spur demand
for the fuel from power plants.  -With assistance from Naureen S. Malik in New York. Editors:
