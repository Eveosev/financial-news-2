Saudi Arabian Mining Co. (MAADEN) ’s gold
production is expected to rise 30 percent by 2014 because of the
output of two new mines, said  Al Rajhi Capital , the investment
arm of the country’s largest lender by market value.  The gold business of the state-run producer known as Maaden
hasn’t experienced any significant production growth since
achieving its highest level of 203,665 ounces in 2005, the bank
said today in an e-mailed report. “Since then, the company has
maintained production at steady levels in a bid to increase the
lifespan of its existing mines,” it said.  Maaden is developing two new mines, Ad Duwayhi and As Suq,
according to the bank, and they are crucial for the gold
business of the company as “the existing mines are on the verge
of exhaustion.”  Al Rajhi  said it “conservatively” expects output of about
240,000-260,000 ounces of gold by the end of 2015, compared with
Maaden’s own forecast of 400,000 ounces. “This is based on our
assumption of a moderate growth over 2012-2013 and a significant
uptick in volumes after the introduction of new mines from the
second-half of 2013 onward,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
