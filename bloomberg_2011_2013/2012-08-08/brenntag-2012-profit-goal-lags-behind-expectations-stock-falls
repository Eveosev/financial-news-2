Brenntag AG (BNR) , the chemical distributor
aspiring to join  Germany ’s benchmark DAX index, predicted profit
growth for this year that fell short of analysts estimates,
prompting the biggest stock drop in a month.  Operating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, which also excludes reorganization and financing
costs, will probably reach 705 million euros (873 million) to
735 million euros in 2012, the Muelheim an der Ruhr, Germany-
based company said today in a statement. Analyst Heiko Feber of
Bankhaus Lampe KG had expected 737 million euros.  Chief Executive Officer Steven Holland said today the
company would have to be vigilant in case the global economy
worsens and predicted regional differences in growth rates
because of the “difficult” economic conditions. Brenntag is
counting on the seven acquisitions it made in the past 12 months
will help boost growth.  “The big positive outlook for 2012 that most people
expected was not given,” said Feber, who rates the stock buy.  The stock dropped as much as 3.89 euros, or 4.2 percent, to
88.61 euros in Frankfurt, and traded at 89.95 euros as of 10:38
a.m. The stock has gained 25 percent this year, valuing Brenntag
at about 4.63 billion euros.  Second-quarter operating profit gained 10 percent to 184.4
million euros, beating the average 180.5 million-euro analyst
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Sales rose 15 percent to 2.49
billion euros, exceeding a 2.41 billion-euro estimate.  The chemical distributor bought a majority stake in Zhong
Yung Chemical Ltd. in  Hong Kong  last year and last month
purchased ISM/Salkat Group, which operates in  Australia  and  New
Zealand . The company has also bought assets in the U.S., U.K.,
Italy, Mexico and  South Africa  in the past 12 months.  Brenntag’s full-year forecast assumes no significant
fluctuations in the average U.S. dollar exchange rate and a
“stable” economic situation, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
