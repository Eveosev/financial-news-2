Diamond prices are expected to
rebound as mining companies may struggle to keep pace with a
revival in demand when the global economy recovers, according to
Singapore Diamond Exchange Pte Ltd.  A slowdown, driven by the debt crisis in  Europe , has hurt
demand, Acting Chief Executive Officer Shlomo Tidhar said in an
interview today, without giving a timeframe for the recovery in
prices nor the amount that they may gain. Tidhar told reporters
later that prices may improve from September.  The average price of so-called top-quality 1 carat diamonds
has dropped 12 percent this year, according to the Rapaport
Diamond Trade Index, which rallied 22 percent last year and 14
percent in 2010. Prices may recover in 2013 as supply lags
behind demand, BMO Capital Markets said in June.  “A diamond mine takes between seven to 15 years to turn it
into something that produces, and no world-class mine is known
at this moment to us,” Tidhar said. A so-called world-class
mine produces about $700 million to $800 million or more worth
of diamonds a year, he said.  Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd., which together
accounted for about 16 percent of global output by value in 2010,
have said they are looking to exit the industry as they see
little prospect of repeating the dominance they hold in  iron ore .  To contact the reporter on this story:
