Hanwha Group, a closely held South
Korean industrial conglomerate, created a project development
unit to finance and build power plants that will use panels
produced by its  Hanwha SolarOne (HSOL)  unit.  The unit, Hanwha SolarEnergy America, incorporates  Solar
Monkey , the  Irvine , California-based developer in which Hanwha
purchased a stake in January 2011, according to a statement
today.  “The full capabilities of Hanwha Solar, from manufacturing
to project development to finance, will allow us to become a
leading provider of solar energy services in North America,”
SolarEnergy America Chief Executive Officer Matthew McCullough
said in the statement.  Hanwha SolarEnergy America has a project pipeline totaling
1 gigawatt and has completed six projects in California,
according to the statement.  The company announced in July that it planned to offer
energy-storage technology that would increase the value of solar
systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
