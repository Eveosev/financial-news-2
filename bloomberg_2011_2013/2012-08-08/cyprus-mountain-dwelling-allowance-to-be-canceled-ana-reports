Cyprus’s government has decided that
people who live in mountainous regions won’t receive a special
allowance this year because of the country’s struggling economy,
Athens News Agency reported without citing anyone.  The annual allowance of 5.2 million euros ($6.4 million)
goes to 22,000 residents of 99 communities that are located 600
meters (1,968 feet) above sea level, the state-run news agency
said. A committee set up by areas affected said residents will
descend on Nicosia, the capital, to protest if the government
doesn’t rescind its decision by Sept. 20, the news agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
