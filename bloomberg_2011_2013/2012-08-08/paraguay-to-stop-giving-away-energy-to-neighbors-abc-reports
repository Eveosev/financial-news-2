Paraguay ’s government wants to stop
“giving away” energy to Brazil and Argentina and instead needs
to harness power from its Itaipu y Yacyreta hydroelectric
generators for domestic use, Asuncion-based ABC Color reported
today, citing President Federico Franco.  Paraguay, which has been suspended from the Mercosur trade
bloc led by Argentina and Brazil over its ouster of former
President Fernando Lugo by Congress, only uses 14 percent of the
energy it produces, the newspaper cited Franco as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
