     Aug. 8 (Bloomberg) --Three-time world champion Allyson
Felix of the U.S. won the 200-meters at the London Olympics.  Felix, 26, who ran the fourth fastest time in history at
the U.S. trials, led after the bend and took her advantage to
the line, clocking 21.88 seconds. Felix, a silver medalist in
Beijing four years ago, was followed by 100-meter champion
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce of  Jamaica .  Fraser-Pryce, 25, ran a personal best of 22.09 seconds to
finish ahead of American Carmelita Jeter, 32. Defending champion
Veronica Campbell-Brown finished fourth.  The 30-year-old Campbell-Brown was bidding to become the
first woman to win three-straight individual golds at an
Olympics.  Sanya Richards-Ross, the 400-meter Olympic champion, ended
up fifth as Felix confirmed why she was the favorite to win the
race. She was rated as short 1-8 with bookmaker  William Hill
Plc (WMH) , meaning an $8 bet would return just $1 and the original
stake.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
