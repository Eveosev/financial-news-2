Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP) , the worst
performer on the  London  Stock Exchange this year, declined for
the first time in four days after posting its worst annual loss.  The stock fell 1.2 percent to 36.23 pence by the close in
London. The company reported a loss excluding one-time items of
32.88 cents a share in the year ended June 30, missing the 15
cent  median  of 11 analysts Bloomberg surveyed.  Aquarius idled its Marikana, Everest and Blue Ridge mines
in  South Africa , producer of more than three-quarters of global
output of platinum, as metal prices fell and costs rose. The
company also posted a record net loss of $158 million after a
$97 million currency loss on revaluation of inter-company loans.  Aquarius, which has $257 million of convertible notes,
would need to raise funds to proceed with its 1.2 billion rand
($147 million) acquisition of Booysendal assets from  Northam
Platinum Ltd. (NHM) , the company said, and is exploring alternatives.  “A possible equity issue may weigh on the share price,”
BMO Capital Markets Ltd. analyst Edward Sterck said in a note.  The yield on the company’s $300 million notes due 2015 rose
71 basis points, or 0.71 percentage points, to 22.5 percent, the
highest since June 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “A restructuring of the terms or a corporate Aquarius-
Northam solution would be more mutually beneficial than Aquarius
stalling on its payment,” Dominic O’Kane and Ash Lazenby,
analysts at Liberum Capital Ltd., wrote in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
