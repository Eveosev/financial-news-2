Severn Trent Plc, the U.K.’s second-
largest water company that supplies 4.2 million households and
businesses, said it plans to sell its analytical services unit.  The division provides drinking, wastewater and contaminated
land testing services to U.K. commercial and utility customers,
Severn Trent said today in a statement. The business accounts
for about 1.5 percent of Severn Trent’s revenue, the Coventry,
England-based company said.  “Over recent months, Severn Trent Analytical Services has
become a smaller business that is predominantly commercial
customer-focused,” the utility said. The sale also addresses a
number of commitments Severn Trent “has made to Ofwat in
relation to the pricing of certain contracts at Severn Trent
Analytical Services,” it said about the water services
regulation authority without elaborating.  Ofwat said today it opened a four-week consultation on
proposals to accept binding commitments from Severn Trent
regarding a complaint over water analysis services contracts to
Ofwat that Severn Trent Laboratories “had engaged in anti-
competitive pricing practices.”  Severn Trent, one of the U.K.’s three publicly traded water
companies, said Rothschild was appointed adviser on the sale.
Severn Trent’s shares have risen 14 percent this year compared
with a 13 percent gain over the same period by the 17-member
Bloomberg World Water Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
