Spain raised its 2012 budget-deficit
targets for the central government and the welfare system amid a
worsening recession and the rising cost of regional bailouts.  The goal for the state and the social-security system
combined is 4.5 percent of gross domestic product, according to
a  presentation  sent to the European Commission that the Budget
Ministry posted on its website. Under previous targets for this
year, social security was to be balanced, while the state
forecast a deficit of 3.5 percent.  The latest figures contradict Deputy Budget Minister Marta Fernandez Curras’s July 31 statement that 2012 targets remained
unchanged to leave room for maneuver amid “uncertainty.”  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has vowed to tackle the  euro
area ’s third-largest budget gap even as the recession deepens.
Spain’s overall goal for all levels of spending -- the central
government, the regions, the cities plus the welfare system --
remains 6.3 percent of GDP.  Euro-area finance ministers agreed last month to postpone
for a year the deadline for Spain to bring its budget shortfall
back within the European Union limit of 3 percent of GDP. The
new targets for all levels of government were set at 6.3 percent
in 2012 instead of 5.3 percent; 4.5 percent next year rather
than 3 percent; and 2.8 percent in 2014.  Regional Bailouts  The Budget Ministry document shows a combined budget-
deficit goal for the state and social security of 3.8 percent in
2013 and 2.7 percent in 2014, without providing any breakdown.
That compares with a previous goal for the state alone of 2.5
percent in 2013 and 1.9 percent in 2014, while the social
security was to remain balanced through 2014.  Central government overspending deepened to 4 percent of
GDP in the first half as it bailed out administrative units
including the regions and the social security system. Over the
same period, interest costs to service  Spain ’s debt rose 32.6
percent from a year ago.  Companies’ debt with the social security has increased by
more than 1 billion euros to 7.1 billion euros in the past two
years, a Labor Ministry official, who asked not to be named in
line with government policy, said today.  Spain will take additional adjustment measures this year if
risks of budget slippage persist, according to the document sent
to Brussels. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said on Aug. 5
that Spain won’t introduce more spending cuts or tax increases
because it’s on target to meet its deficit-reduction goals.  Bond Yields  Expectations of European Central Bank intervention to lower
Spain’s borrowing costs have tempered a drop in Spanish debt.
The yield on Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond was at 6.89 percent
at 5:13 p.m. in  Madrid , compared with a euro-era intraday high
of 7.75 percent on July 25, a day after the government signed
off on as much as 100 billion euros of loans for Spain’s banks.  Rajoy’s government expects 10-year borrowing costs to rise
to an average 6.4 percent this year from 5.4 percent last year
and then fall to 5 percent in 2013 and 4.5 percent in 2014,
according to the forecasts sent to Brussels. On April 27, the
forecasts were 5.4 percent this year, 4.7 percent next year and
4.2 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
