U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  should encourage Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan to
address “increasingly deadly violence” by the Boko Haram
Islamist militant group and end impunity for ethnic clashes,
 Human Rights Watch  said.  Clinton “should also raise security-force abuses,
corruption and lack of accountability” when she meets the
president of Africa’s top oil producer tomorrow, the New York-
based watchdog told her in a letter yesterday, according to an
e-mailed statement today.  “Nigeria is facing a surge of violence and lawlessness
that has blighted the lives of thousands of Nigerians,”  Daniel
Bekele , Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said in the
statement. “Nigeria’s leaders need to confront this violence,
whether committed by Boko Haram or the country’s security
forces.”  Clinton’s visit to Abuja, the Nigerian capital, is part of
an Africa tour that includes Uganda, Senegal, Kenya, South Sudan
and  South Africa .  Nigeria has suffered a series of bomb and gun attacks since
2009 in its mainly Muslim north and in Abuja. Assaults by Boko
Haram have left more than 1,400 people dead since 2010, Human
Rights Watch said. In January, Jonathan said the group poses a
more serious threat to the country than the 1967-1970 Biafra
civil war.  The group, whose name means “Western education is a sin”
in the Hausa language, wants Islamic rule in  Africa ’s most
populous nation of more than 160 million people. The country is
almost evenly split between the north and the predominantly
Christian south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
