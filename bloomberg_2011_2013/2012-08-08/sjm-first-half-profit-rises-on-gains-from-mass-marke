SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , the Macau casino
operator founded by billionaire  Stanley Ho , reported a 28
percent increase in first-half profit aided by higher revenue
from mass-market gamblers.  Net income climbed to HK$3.41 billion ($440 million) from
HK$2.67 billion a year earlier, the company said yesterday in a
Hong Kong stock exchange statement. Sales rose 3.9 percent to
HK$39.3 billion, similar to the average estimate of three
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  SJM, operator of casinos including the Grand Lisboa and
Ponte 16 on the Macau peninsula, faces rising competition from
 Sands China Ltd. (1928)  and  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  as demand
from rich mainland Chinese gamblers drops. Macau gaming revenue
rose 1.5 percent to 24.6 billion patacas ($3.1 billion) in July,
the smallest gain since 2009, on easing demand from high-rollers
and the effect of a typhoon.  “SJM will see less impact from a VIP slowdown than its
peninsula peers,” George Choi, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in
Hong Kong, said in a report to clients. “Its loyal sticky mass-
market customers should limit its downside risks.”  The company’s market share dropped to 27 percent from 31.1
percent a year earlier, it said in the statement. SJM’s mass-
market table revenue rose 15.1 percent to HK$11.7 billion from
HK$10.2 billion a year ago.  SJM shares advanced 0.8 percent to close at HK$15.10 before
the announcement. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  was little
changed.  Market Share  Investors have “over-penalized” the loss of market share,
which has stabilized since September 2011, Gabriel Chan, a Hong
Kong-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said before the
announcement.  “Market share of higher-margin Grand Lisboa remains
solid,” Chan said. Most of the decline was at lower-margin
“self-operated and satellite casinos,” he said  SJM, which owns 20 of the 35  casinos in Macau , said earlier
this year it was in advanced talks with the Macau government to
build a new casino.  The company will pay an interim dividend of 10 Hong Kong
cents a share, compared with 8 Hong Kong cents a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
