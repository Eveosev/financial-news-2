Corio NV (CORA) , the largest publicly traded
Dutch real estate company, declined the most in more than three
months after lowering its full-year earnings forecast as rental
growth slowed and its shopping malls depreciated.  The company said in a statement yesterday it would have a
“marginally lower” direct result, or earnings excluding
changes in asset values and deferred tax. Corio, based in
Utrecht, in May predicted profit would be unchanged. The direct
result in the first half was unchanged at  1.46 euros a share .  Europe ’s economic downturn made it more difficult to
increase rents and led Corio to step up incentives to keep
tenants. Rents for properties owned throughout the first half
rose 0.8 percent, down from a 1.4 percent growth rate in the
first quarter. Net asset value declined 7.8 percent from six
months earlier to 43.49 euros a share, mainly due to a writedown
of its Centrum Galerie mall in Dresden,  Germany .  “Corio’s results were a bit disappointing,” said  Harm Meijer , an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. with a neutral rating
on the shares. Even “‘stable’ countries like the Netherlands
and  France  are starting to show weakness.”  Corio declined as much as 4.8 percent, the most since April
23. The shares were down 3.9 percent to 35.2 euros at 11:08 a.m.
in Amsterdam, dropping the company’s market value to 3.38
billion euros.  Corio shares  have risen 4.2 percent in the past three
months, compared with a gain of about 11 percent in the
benchmark FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
