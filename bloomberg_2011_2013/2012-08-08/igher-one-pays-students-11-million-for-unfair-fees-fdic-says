Higher One Holdings Inc. (ONE)  and  Bancorp
Inc. (TBBK)  have agreed to pay civil penalties for unfair handling of
student debit-card fees, according to the U.S. Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.  Higher One will pay $11 million in restitution to students
cheated by extra fees, the FDIC said today in a  statement . The
New Haven, Connecticut-based company is affiliated with Bancorp
of Wilmington,  Delaware , which agreed in the settlement to
improve its compliance management. The banks, neither admitting
nor denying wrongdoing in consent orders with the regulator,
will pay a combined $282,000 in civil penalties, the FDIC said.  “We believe the relatively low civil money penalty imposed
reflects how seriously we take our commitment to our customers,
the degree of the issue, and our level of cooperation with the
FDIC,” Mark Volchek, Higher One’s chief executive officer, said
in a statement. He said his company, a payment-services firm
focused on higher education, is fixing its practices as required
in the settlement and has credited affected account holders.  The banks violated the Federal Trade Commission Act by
charging holders of Higher One’s student debit cards -- issued
by Bancorp -- with excessive insufficient-funds fees and letting
accounts rack up fees by keeping them in overdrawn status,
according to the settlement. The restitution payments from
Higher One will go to about 60,000 students, the FDIC said.  Bancorp didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment
left in a voicemail for its media contact.  To contact the reporter on this story:
