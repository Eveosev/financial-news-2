Iraq signed a contract with Pell
Frischmann Ltd. for the design of a $85 million water project in
the western Al Anbar province, a local municipal official said.  The U.K.-based consulting company will draw designs for a
new water station in Hadeetha, which will pump 4,500 cubic meter
of water an hour to feed surrounding towns, within two years,
Basim Naji said by phone today. Pell Frischmann will also design
an upgrade to an existing water station in the same district
which pumps 1,500 cubic meter an hour, he said.  The Iraqi government is seeking foreign investment and
expertise to rebuild its infrastructure and energy industry
damaged by decades of conflict and sanctions. Iraq holds the
fifth-largest proven crude reserves, including  Canada ’s oil
sands, according to data from  BP Plc. (BP/)   To contact the reporters on this story:
