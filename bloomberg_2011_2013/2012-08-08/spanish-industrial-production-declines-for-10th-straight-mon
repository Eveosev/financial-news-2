 Spanish  industrial production  fell
for a 10th straight month in June as the recession in the euro
area’s fourth-largest economy worsened amid more austerity
measures to stem a surge in borrowing costs.  Output at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the
number of working days, fell 6.3 percent from a year earlier,
after declining a revised 6.5 percent in May, the National
Statistics Institute in  Madrid  INE said in an e-mailed statement
today. Economists forecast an annual drop of 6.2 percent,
according to the median of eight estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  last month gave up on the
prospect of an economic recovery next year as he increased to
more than 100 billion euros ($124 billion), or 10 percent of
annual output, the amount of budget cuts and tax increases
planned through 2014 to tackle the euro area’s third-largest
budget gap.  Spain’s recession intensified in the  second quarter , while
unemployment reached 24.6 percent, the highest in the country’s
34 years of democratic history. The number of bankruptcies
increased 28.6 percent in the three months through June from a
year ago, INE said on Aug. 6.  U.S.-based materials manufacturer Formica Corp. said June
29 it is in talks with about 180 workers for mass layoffs as
falling volume has made keeping two plants in  Spain  unviable.
Weeks earlier, Spanish clothing designer Adolfo Dominguez
presented a plan to cut 3 percent of its workforce.  Expectations of a European Central Bank intervention to
lower Spain’s borrowing costs have muted a drop in Spanish debt.
The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  was at 6.93  percent
at 8:18 a.m. in Madrid, compared with a euro-era intraday high
of 7.75 percent on July 25, a day after the government signed
off on as much as 100 billion euros of loans from European
rescue funds for the country’s banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
