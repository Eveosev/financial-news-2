XL Group Plc (XL)  climbed the most in
almost a year in  New York  trading after the insurer’s second-
quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates as premium revenue
increased.  XL jumped $1.36, or 6.4 percent, to $22.73 at 11:08 a.m.,
the biggest intraday gain since last August. The Dublin-based
insurer has gained 15 percent since Dec. 31 and is up  sixfold 
from the end of 2008, the year the stock plunged on losses tied
to mortgage-market bets.  Operating profit in the three months ended June 30 was 71
cents a share, the company said late yesterday in a statement,
beating by 16 cents the  average estimate  of 20 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Premium revenue increased 7.3 percent to $1.4
billion. The insurer earned 9.2 cents of underwriting profit for
every premium dollar, up from 5.1 cents a year earlier.  “We view XL’s second-quarter results as strong, reflecting
the company’s ongoing efforts at turning its business around,”
 Arun Kumar  and Brett Gibson, credit analysts at JPMorgan Chase &
Co., said in a note today. “Highlights include notably improved
underlying underwriting results.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
