Karachi Electric Supply Corp., (KESC)  the
supplier of power to  Pakistan ’s biggest city, reported a full-
year profit for the first time in seven years after the company
reduced line losses and power theft.  Net profit was 2.62 billion rupees ($27.8 million) or 0.11
rupees a share, for the 12 months ended June 30. It compares
with a loss of 9.39 billion rupees, or 0.44 rupees a share, in
2011, the company said today in a filing.  Profitability will allow Karachi Electric to replace
outdated meters and defunct transformers that have contributed
to losses in revenue. The utility is cutting costs and adding
generation plants to help reduce outages that led to street
protests by residents of the city last year.  “They made an effort to reduce their cost,” said Faisal Khan, a research analyst with  Arif Habib Ltd. (AHL)  “Curbing the
electricity theft and lining up their tariffs according to the
fuel cost were the main areas where the results helped their net
profit.”  It’s the first time Karachi Electric has turned a full-year
profit since the company went private in 2005.  The company’s shares had risen 14 percent to 4.21 rupees as
of 11:51 a.m., the highest since May 3, in volumes more than six
times the three-month average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
