Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  jumped amid
speculation by a Jefferies & Co analyst that  Samsung Electronics
Co. (005930)  may license the struggling BlackBerry maker’s new software
or consider buying the company.  The shares gained 4.2 percent to $7.62 at the close in New
York.  Peter Misek , a Jefferies analyst, said yesterday the
Waterloo, Ontario-based company may be trying to revive talks
with Samsung to license its BlackBerry 10 operating system.  “Samsung is considering ramping up its internal
development efforts, licensing BB10 or buying RIM,” Misek, who
has the equivalent of a sell rating on RIM, wrote yesterday in a
note. “Samsung is undecided.”  RIM, struggling with falling sales and shrinking market
share, is counting on a pair of new BB10 phones expected to be
released early next year to revive the BlackBerry brand among
U.S. consumers. Its share of the global smartphone market fell
to 4.8 percent in the second quarter from 12 percent a year
earlier as  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system climbed to 68
percent and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone platform slipped to 17 percent,
according to IDC.  RIM doesn’t comment on stock market fluctuations, said Nick
Manning, a company spokesman. Amy Grenek, a Samsung spokeswoman
at the public-relations firm Edelman, didn’t immediately return
a call seeking comment.  Options interest in RIM has also surged. Almost 100,000
calls to buy the shares changed hands, 4 times the four-week
average daily volume and 1.5 times the number of puts to sell,
according to U.S. options data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
