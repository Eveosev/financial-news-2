What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
lower as forecasts for rain during the next five days boost the
yield outlook for crops in the U.S. Midwest,  Dan Cekander , the
director of grain research for Newedge USA LLC in Chicago, said
in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures may open steady to down 2 cents a bushel on
speculation that a 61 percent jump in prices since June 15 will
slow buying before the U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s
production forecasts on Aug. 10, Cekander said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower after
a 49 percent jump in prices since June 1 slows overseas demand
for U.S. supplies, Cekander said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
