Japanese  stocks  rose a third day,
sending the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average to a four-week high, on
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will act to support growth. The
yen weakened after Japan posted a bigger-than-expected current
account surplus for June, boosting exporters.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets about 80 percent of
its sales abroad, gained 1.4 percent.  Advantest Corp. (6857)  and other
chip-related companies climbed after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
boosted its outlook for the U.S. semiconductor industry. Sharp
Corp. rose 2.7 percent on a Nikkei newspaper report that Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co. remains committed to a partnership with
the electronics maker.  Pioneer Corp. (6773)  plunged 7 percent after
cutting its earnings forecast.  “Today’s currency movements are bolstering the Japanese
market, which is a laggard compared with U.S. and Europe,” said
 Masaru Hamasaki , Tokyo-based chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co., which manages the equivalent of $23 billion.
“Expectations of global monetary easing are triggering a boost
in markets.”  The Nikkei 225 gained 0.9 percent to 8,881.16 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, with volume 37 percent above the 30-day average.
The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index rose 0.3 percent to 745.64. Almost three
times as many shares advanced for each that fell on the gauge.  Shares pared gains after the Nikkei 225 gained as much as
5.1 percent over the past three days, headed for the biggest
weekly advance this year, fueling speculation the shares had
risen too far, too fast.  Easing Prospects  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.1 percent
today. The gauge rose 0.5 percent yesterday amid better-than-
expected U.S. corporate earnings. More than 70 percent of the
 S&P 500 (SPX)  companies that reported second-quarter results beat
estimates, Bloomberg data show. Shares also rose after Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston President  Eric Rosengren  said the central
bank should pursue an “open-ended” easing program of
“substantial magnitude.”  “Remarks about strengthening easing policies have
encouraged investors to buy shares when there aren’t many
catalysts to move the market,” said Toyota Asset Management’s
Hamasaki.  The yen fell after Japan’s surplus in its widest measure of
trade rose to 433.3 billion yen ($5.5 billion) in June, compared
to 215.1 billion yen the month before, as  oil prices  fell to a
year low. The currency weakened to as low as 78.74 against the
dollar today in Tokyo, compared with 78.28 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday. The yen fell to 97.82 euro from 96.98. A
weaker yen boosts overseas income at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  Honda gained 1.4 percent to 2,535 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker
of industrial robots that earns about 75 percent of revenue
overseas, advanced 1.3 percent to 12,350 yen.  Topix Rebound  The Topix rebounded 7.2 percent from this year’s low on
June 4 as central banks around the world ease policy to support
growth. The  Bank of Japan  is scheduled to start a two-day policy
meeting today at which it is expected to refrain from additional
monetary easing due to its view that the economy is experiencing
a moderate recovery, the Nikkei reported, without citing anyone.  The price of shares on the gauge stood at 0.9 times book
value, compared with 2.2 times for the S&P 500 and 1.5 times for
the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means that
companies can be bought for less than value of their assets.  Chip-related companies gained after Goldman Sachs boosted
its U.S. semiconductor view to attractive from neutral, saying
product supply is healthy. Advantest gained 3.2 percent to 1,047
yen.  Sumco Corp. (3436) , a silicon wafer maker, rose 1.5 percent to 594
yen.  Sharp Rebound  Sharp climbed 2.7 percent to 188 yen after a Nikkei
newspaper report that the electronics maker and Hon Hai
Precision Industry will make an announcement this week that they
remain committed to a partnership, without mentioning any
revision to terms of the investment after Sharp’s shares plunged
last week. The report cited no sources.  A third of the Topix’s 1,672 companies are scheduled to
release earnings this week. Of the 294 companies that have
 reported  since July 1 that have issued forecasts, 51 percent
have missed expectations, according to Bloomberg data.  Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co. and Pioneer declined the
most on the Nikkei 225 after cutting their outlooks on lower-
than-expected sales. Dainippon Screen, a chip-equipment maker,
plunged 8.9 percent to 472 yen, after cutting its net-income
forecast 96 percent to 500 million yen. Pioneer sank 7 percent
to 199 yen after trimming its profit projection 15 percent to
8.5 billion yen.  “Japanese corporate earnings are bad, and share gains are
being driven by other markets,” said Resona Bank’s Toda. “The
earnings outlook seems to indicate  Japan ’s economy will
deteriorate toward the end of the year. The strong yen and weak
demand in Asia are behind the earnings results.”  -- With assistance from Toshiro Hasegawa in Tokyo. Editor: Jim Powell  To contact the reporters on this story:
