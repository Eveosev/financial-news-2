The Czech Senate’s committee for the
economy recommended that the upper house of parliament reject a
government bill that raises taxes starting next year,  CTK 
newswire reported, citing the result of the panel’s session.  The Senate, in which the opposition Social Democrats hold a
majority, will debate the legislation starting on Aug. 15. The
government can overturn the Senate vote in a new ballot in the
lower house of parliament in Prague.  The Cabinet is seeking to increase the value-added tax
rates and create a new income-tax bracket for high earners in a
bid to reduce the fiscal deficit to less than the European
Union’s limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
