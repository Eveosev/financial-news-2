Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold  North Sea 
Forties crude at a lower price than yesterday. No bids or offers
were made for Russian Urals in Europe for a second day.  Indian Oil Corp. bought 4 million barrels of West African
crudes for loading in October from Shell and Chevron Corp. via a
tender, four traders who participate in the market said.  North Sea  Shell sold Forties cargo F0901 for Sept. 1 to Sept. 3
loading to Total SA at 55 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent,
compared with a deal yesterday at a premium of 60 cents,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts trading window.  BP Plc failed to sell the blend for Aug. 26 to Aug. 28 at
71 cents more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was at 65 cents a barrel more
than Dated Brent, the highest since March 16, compared with a
premium of 44 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for September settlement traded at $112.76 a barrel
on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, up from $111.55 yesterday. The October contract was at
$111.18, a discount of $1.58 to September.  Daily exports of Aasgard crude in September will increase
by 5.8 percent from August, a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News showed.  The schedule comprises six cargoes of 855,000 barrels each
and one shipment of 1 million barrels, totaling 204,333 barrels
a day, the plan showed. This compares with seven lots of 855,000
barrels amounting to 193,065 barrels a day in August.  Loadings of Grane will drop to four shipments of 600,000
barrels, two less than August, according to a separate plan.  BPâ€™s North Sea Unity Riser, an oil and gas facility, is in
operations after shutting for maintenance on Aug. 1, spokesman
Mark Salt said in an e-mail.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals blend advanced 7 cents to a premium of 50 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Iraq  resumed pumping crude, including from the semi-
autonomous Kurdish area, through an alternative pipeline, after
a sabotage explosion halted shipments through the main link,
according to North Oil Co.  The exports include an average of 75,000 to 100,000 barrels
a day from  oil fields  in the northern Kurdish area, the Iraqi
state company said in a statement. Shipments from northern Iraq
are due to reach an average 400,000 barrels by the end of the
month, it said.  West Africa  Indian Oil purchased 1 million barrels each of Nigerian Qua
Iboe and EA from Shell, and 1 million barrels each of Nigerian
Agbami and Angolan Girassol from Chevron, according to the
people, who declined to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe rose 4 cents to $1.46 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, the highest since June 19, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
