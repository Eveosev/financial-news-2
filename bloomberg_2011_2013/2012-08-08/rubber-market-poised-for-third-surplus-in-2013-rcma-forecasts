Global natural-rubber supply will
exceed demand for a third straight year in 2013 and the price of
the commodity used to make tires and gloves is set to extend
declines, according to RCMA Commodities Asia Group.  Production will exceed usage by 299,000 metric tons in 2013,
compared with a surplus of 321,000 tons estimated for this year
and 4,000 tons in 2011, the Singapore-based trading company said
in a presentation e-mailed to Bloomberg. Global stockpiles may
gain 26 percent to 1.57 million tons this year, it showed.  Rubber fell to the lowest level since 2009 yesterday amid
lower consumption in  China , the largest user, and Europe. Demand
in China may drop 5 percent this year as slumping  truck sales 
cut heavy-duty tire sales, Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Co., the
country’s biggest maker, said last month. Lower prices will hurt
growers in  Thailand ,  Indonesia  and  Malaysia , the three largest
producers, while aiding tiremakers such as  Bridgestone Corp. (5108)   “We’re still seeing a slowdown in demand in Europe and
China, and good supply, resulting in a buildup of stocks,” Chief
Executive Officer Chris Pardey said in a phone and e-mail
interview. Prices should decline to stimulate demand or reduce
supply, Pardey said, without giving a precise figure.  Rubber lost 3.5 percent to close at 219.2 yen per kilogram
($2,795 per ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange yesterday, the
lowest finish since October 2009. Over the past year, the most-
active price has plunged 41 percent as crude oil in  New York 
advanced 15 percent, and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index,
which tracks raw materials, climbed 5.5 percent.  Higher Output  Global production is expected to climb to 11.9 million tons
in 2013 from 11.47 million tons this year, according to the
presentation, with first-half increases seen in Thailand,
Malaysia, Indonesia,  Vietnam  and India. World demand may rise to
11.6 million tons in 2013 from 11.15 million tons this year.  Slower economic growth in China, the world’s second-largest
economy, and the debt crisis in  Europe  have slowed demand for
industrial commodities. Sales of trucks in China fell 7 percent
in the first six months of 2012, according to data from the
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  Demand in China may contract 0.7 percent to 3.75 million
tons this year, before rebounding 4.1 percent in 2013, according
to the presentation. European usage may drop 5.3 percent to 1.4
million tons in 2012, and expand 2.9 percent in 2013, it showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
