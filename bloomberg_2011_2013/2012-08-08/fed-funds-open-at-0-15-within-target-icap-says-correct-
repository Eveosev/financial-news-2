(Corrects opening rate in the first paragraph.)  Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.15 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.10 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.09 percent to 0.15 percent and averaging 0.12 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will buy $1.5 billion to $2 billion of
Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to May 2042. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s program to replace $267 billion
of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries
in an effort to keep borrowing costs low.  The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  may also add reserves
to the banking system through  repurchase agreements  as part of
an “operational readiness program.” The transactions don’t
represent any change in Fed monetary policy and are part of the
central bank’s efforts to test its readiness to conduct
temporary open market operations.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
