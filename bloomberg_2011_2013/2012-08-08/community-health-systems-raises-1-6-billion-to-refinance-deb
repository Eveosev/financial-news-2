Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH) , the
second-largest U.S. hospital chain, raised $1.6 billion to
refinance debt.  The issue of 5.125 percent, six-year notes, which was
increased from $1.25 billion, yields 423 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Proceeds from the senior-secured notes will be used
to buy a portion of $2.2 billion of term loans due in 2014, the
Franklin, Tennessee-based company said today in a regulatory
filing.  The company tapped the  debt market  less than two weeks
after the U.S. Supreme Court decided June 28 to leave President
 Barack Obama â€™s transformation of the health system substantially
intact. Speculative-grade bonds of health-care providers rallied
after the ruling, which boosted investor optimism for the
industry by reducing the risk that the companies will be stuck
with unpaid bills.  The hospital company sold $1.2 billion of 7.125 percent,
eight-year bonds July 9, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The securities traded at 105 cents on the dollar for
a yield of 6.31 percent as of 3:55 p.m. in New York, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup
Inc., Credit Agricole SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Canada, SunTrust
Banks Inc. and  Wells Fargo & Co . managed the sale, Bloomberg
data show. HCA Holdings Inc. is the largest U.S. hospital chain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
