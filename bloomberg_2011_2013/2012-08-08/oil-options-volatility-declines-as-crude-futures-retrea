Oil options volatility slipped as
underlying futures declined for the first time in four days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.42 percent at 5 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 30 yesterday.  Crude oil for September delivery fell 32 cents to settle at
$93.35 a barrel on the Nymex.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $100 calls, which fell 9 cents to 19 cents a barrel at
5:02 p.m. with 1,495 lots trading. September $95 calls were the
second-most active options, with 1,270 lots changing hands as
they declined 20 cents to $1 a barrel.  Calls accounted for 59 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets accounted for 54
percent of the 151,968 contracts traded.  September $100 calls were the most actively traded options,
with 9,701 lots changing hands. They rose 8 cents to 28 cents a
barrel. December $90 puts declined 63 cents to $3.96 on volume
of 5,444.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 43,483
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 43,350 lots and
December $120 calls with 39,683.  To contact the reporter on this story:
