Sweden ’s krona may strengthen to
almost a record level against the euro, according to Credit
Suisse Group AG, citing technical indicators.  The krona will reach 8.0480 per euro as long as it stays
stronger than the area from 8.4635 to 8.5052, research analysts
wrote today in a client note. The Swedish currency’s strongest
level since the shared currency’s 1999 inception is 8.0469,
reached in May 2000.  “We would view any strength as corrective,” the analysts
wrote, referring to the euro. “While below the price hurdle at
8.5052, the intermediate risks are still lower to 8.0480.” A
call to Credit Suisse was not immediately returned.  The krona rose 0.8 percent to 8.2732 per euro at 12:38 p.m.
in  New York  after gaining as much as 1 percent to 8.2546, its
strongest level since June 2000.  A break through the 8.2612 level “turns the focus
immediately lower,” according to the note.  Sweden, one of only 12 nations ranked AAA at the three
biggest credit-rating companies, has seen its currency
strengthen after emerging as a haven from  Europe ’s debt turmoil.
The krona has also gained after central banks in other havens
such as Denmark and Switzerland stepped up efforts to counter a
capital influx using currency interventions and rate cuts.  Norway’s krone rose to its highest level since 2003 against
the 17-nation currency, gaining as much as 1.1 percent to
7.2585.  “There’s a lot of focus on these currencies as safe havens
with strong fundamentals,”  Niels Christensen , chief currency
strategist at  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  in Copenhagen, said in a telephone
interview. “There’s a double effect of demand for these
currencies and a weak euro. A lot of investors are favoring
these currencies.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
