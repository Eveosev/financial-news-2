Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.,
the U.S. Navy’s sole builder of aircraft carriers, rose the most
in four months as higher sales helped second-quarter earnings
top estimates.  Huntington, based in  Newport News , Virginia, increased 4.1
percent to $40.23 in New York, the biggest one-day gain since
March 28. The shares have increased 29 percent this year.  Profit jumped to $1 a share in the quarter that ended June
30 from 80 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Analysts
had predicted profit of 69 cents a share, the average of 12
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The quarter “reflected the strong execution of our
existing contracts and demonstrated the steady progress toward
restoring margins,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Petters said
in a statement.  Sales advanced to $1.72 billion from $1.56 billion in the
year-ago period. The increase was attributed in part to higher
sales in amphibious assault ships.  The company was spun off last year from  Falls Church ,
Virginia-based  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)   To contact the reporter on this story:
