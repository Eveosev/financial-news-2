PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  led companies selling
$11.45 billion of dollar-denominated debt today after relative
yields on U.S. corporate bonds fell to the lowest in a year.  The world’s biggest snack food maker issued $2.5 billion of
debt in a three-part sale, while  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners
LP (KMP) , the largest U.S. natural gas distributor, sold $1.25 billion
of bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. PepsiCo’s
sale included $900 million of 0.7 percent, three-year notes that
yielded 33 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries.  The offerings brought sales this week to $30.6 billion, the
busiest start since $31.6 billion was sold in the three days
ended July 11, Bloomberg data show. Companies are borrowing more
as the extra yield investors demand to hold corporate debt
rather than government securities drops.  “The market’s still pristine and there’s still a lot of
cash around, but the pool of high-quality money is getting
thinner by the day as spreads come in,” Timothy Cox, executive
director of debt capital markets at Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
in  New York , said in a telephone interview.  Investors are asking for a bigger discount on new bonds
relative to outstanding debt to participate in offerings, Cox
said. PepsiCo’s $750 million of 0.75 percent, three-year notes
due March 2015 traded at a 26 basis-point spread at 4:29 p.m. in
New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That’s 7 basis
points less than on the three-year notes that PepsiCo sold.  Spreads Drop  The spread on bonds from the riskiest to the most
creditworthy borrowers declined 2 basis points yesterday to 268
basis points, the lowest since Aug. 3, 2011, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Master
index.  “There’s still a lot of cash being put to work,” Cox
said.  PepsiCo’s offering also included $1 billion of 1.25
percent, five-year notes and $600 million of 3.6 percent, 30-
year bonds, Bloomberg data show. Houston-based Kinder Morgan
Energy issued $625 million each of 3.45 percent, 10.5-year debt
at 185 basis points more than Treasuries and 5 percent, 30-year
bonds at a 230 basis-point spread.  Community Health  The average yield on investment-grade corporate debt
dropped to 3.1 percent as of yesterday, from 3.9 percent at the
end of 2011, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.
Corporate issuers have sold $829 billion of debt in the U.S. so
far this year, increasing 6 percent from the same period last
year, Bloomberg data show.  Franklin, Tennessee-based  Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH) ,
the second-largest U.S. hospital chain, sold $1.6 billion of
notes due in August 2018 to refinance debt, the data show.  ServiceMaster Co., the owner of the TruGreen landscaping
and Terminix pest control businesses, sold $1 billion of 6.125
percent, eight-year notes, Bloomberg data show. The size of the
transaction was more than tripled from $300 million earlier in
the day, according to a person familiar with the transaction who
asked for anonymity as the details were private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
