Jamaican sprinter Asafa Powell has
pulled out of the London Olympics with an injury he sustained
during the 100-meter final and won’t compete again this season,
his agent said.  Powell, who had been scheduled to compete in the 400-meter
sprint relay, has “two separate tears in his adductors and will
end his season,” his agent, Paul Doyle, said in an e-mail.   “He should be fully recovered in four to six weeks and
will resume training for the 2013 season,” Doyle said.  Powell, 29, pulled up during the 100-meter final on Aug. 5,
and limped to the finish.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
