MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG)  had the
financial strength rating of its main insurance unit cut by
Moody’s Investors Service as losses from backing home loans
drain capital.  The rating was lowered to B2 from B1 “due to the continued
deterioration of the insurer’s regulatory capital position and
to reflect the possible adverse credit implications of its
ongoing dispute with  Freddie Mac , one of its largest
counterparties,” the ratings firm said in a statement today on
Milwaukee-based MGIC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
