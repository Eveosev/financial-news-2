OAO United Shipbuilding Corp., a
Russian state company, may buy 76 percent of OAO Northern
Shipyard at a 15 percent discount to the initial auction price,
 Vedomosti  said, citing an unidentified person close to the
plant’s owners.  The first auction for St. Petersburg-based shipyard failed
with a start price of 14 billion rubles ($443 million) for the
stake, the newspaper said. The price may be cut by 15 percent
for a second sale attempt, Vedomosti said.  The stake in Northern shipyard, which constructs ships for
the Russian navy, was previously owned by Sergei Pugachov, a
former member of  Russia ’s upper house of parliament. The shares
were put up as collateral for a 32 billion-ruble loan from the
central bank to his  International Industrial Bank  in 2010, the
newspaper said.  Northern shipyard, Rosimushchestvo and central bank
representatives declined to comment for the Vedomosti article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
