     Aug. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Arabtec Holding Co., the biggest
builder in the  United Arab Emirates  by market value, posted a
second-quarter loss, missing analystsâ€™ estimates, as costs and
expenses increased.  The loss attributable to owners of the parent was 11.6
million dirhams after a profit of 29 million dirhams a year
earlier,  the company said in a statement  to the Dubai stock
market today. The average estimate of six analysts was for a
profit of 73 million dirhams, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.   Abu Dhabi government-controlled Aabar Investments PJSC
raised its  stake  in Dubai-based Arabtec this year to 21.6
percent, prompting a surge in the shares. The company said in
June that along with TAV Insaat of  Turkey  and others it won a
contract valued at about $3 billion to build a terminal at Abu
Dhabi Airport.  Contract costs increased to 1.19 billion dirhams in the
second quarter from 1.08 billion dirhams a year earlier, while
administrative expenses rose to 154.2 million from 95 million
dirhams. Revenue climbed to 1.32 billion dirhams from 1.22
billion dirhams, according to the company statement.  The shares  dropped 0.7 percent to 3.02 dirhams in Dubai
yesterday. The stock has gained 99 percent this year compared
with a 15 percent increase for the benchmark  Dubai Financial
Market General Index. (DFMGI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
