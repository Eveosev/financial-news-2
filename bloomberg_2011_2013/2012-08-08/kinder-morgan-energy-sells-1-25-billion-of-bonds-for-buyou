Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP) , the
largest U.S. natural gas distributor, sold $1.25 billion of
bonds to fund the acquisition of Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. and
a stake in El Paso Natural Gas Co., according to a regulatory
filing.  Kinder Morgan Energy issued $625 million of 3.45 percent,
10.5-year debt to yield 185 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries and an additional $625 million in 5 percent,
30-year securities to yield 230 basis points more than
benchmarks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds
may be rated Baa2, the second-lowest investment grade, by
Moody’s Investors Service.  The company agreed to buy Tennessee Gas Pipeline and a 50
percent interest in El Paso Natural Gas from its parent company
Kinder Morgan Inc. for about $6.2 billion Aug. 6. The
partnership will use  cash flow  from the systems to make up for
revenue it’s expected to lose after agreeing to sell about 7,200
miles (11,500 kilometers) of pipelines to gain regulatory
approval for the El Paso deal.  The Houston-based energy company last sold a benchmark
offering in March. The $1 billion of 3.95 percent bonds due in
2022 traded at 104.7 cents on the dollar to yield 3.4 percent
yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Citigroup Inc., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and  Wells
Fargo & Co ., managed the sale, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
