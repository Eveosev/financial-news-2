Cautious consumers are slowing auto
demand, a trend that won’t clear up until after the November
presidential election, said  Jim Lentz , chief executive officer
of the U.S. sales arm of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which took back the
global auto-sales lead in 2012’s first half.  “Before they take a step into greater debt, they want some
sense of stability in the future,” Lentz told reporters on the
sidelines of an auto conference in Acme,  Michigan . “As soon as
we have that, I think you’ll see this industry rocking.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
