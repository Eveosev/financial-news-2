Google Inc. (GOOG)  is testing a service
that’s designed to make it easier for users to search their e-
mail accounts while seeking information on the Web.  The new service, currently part of a field trial, will
display search results from an e-mail account alongside results
culled from the Web. Google executives discussed the service on
a  blog  and at a presentation in San Francisco.  “Sometimes the best answer to your question isn’t
available on the public Web -- it may be contained somewhere
else, such as in your e-mail,” according to the blog. “You
shouldn’t have to be your own mini-search engine to find the
most useful information -- it should just work.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
