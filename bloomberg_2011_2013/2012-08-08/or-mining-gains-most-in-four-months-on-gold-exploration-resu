Thor Mining Plc (THR)  rose the most in four
months in London after the Australian explorer announced results
for a gold project in the country’s Northern Territory.  Thor Mining climbed as much as 18 percent, the biggest gain
since April 10. Up to 12 grams a metric ton were returned from
sampling at the Spring Hill site, the Perth-based company said.  “We are delighted with this early level of mineralization
in the near-surface sections of our drilling,” Executive
Chairman Mick Billing said in a statement. “While our main
targets are below the areas drilled thus far, the extensive gold
mineralization above and east of these is very welcome.”  Drilling tests gold deposits below the known mining hole,
Thor Mining said today in the statement. The company will drill
deeper and broader holes this year on the basis of the results.  Thor rose 7.9 percent to 1.02 pence by 9:15 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
