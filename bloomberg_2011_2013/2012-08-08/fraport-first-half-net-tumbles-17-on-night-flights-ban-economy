Frankfurt  airport operator Fraport AG
said first-half profit fell 17 percent as a night-flights ban,
increased spending and a sluggish economy weighed on margins.  Net income fell to 86.9 million euros ($108 million) from
105.2 million euros a year earlier, Fraport said in a statement.
Analysts had predicted earnings of 88.4 million euros, based on
the average of seven estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Flights from Frankfurt,  Europe ’s third-busiest airport and
the chief hub of  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , have been barred between
11 p.m. and 5 a.m. since October following a court ruling linked
to the opening of a fourth runway. Six-month cargo tonnage fell
9.9 percent as a result of the ban, with the drop heightened by
a weaker global economy and the  European debt crisis , while
spending was lifted by investment in the runway and a new pier.  Chief Executive Officer Stefan Schulte said that while the
air-transportation industry is enduring a “difficult period,”
Fraport still expects annual revenue to exceed 2.5 billion euros
and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
to advance by at least 5 percent, as forecast in May. Net income
should match last year’s figure of 240 million euros, he said.  Fraport, which also runs airports in Peru, Turkey and
 Bulgaria , said half-year revenue increased 2.5 percent to 1.15
billion euros. Ebitda advanced 2 percent to 366 million euros.  Passenger numbers at Frankfurt, which ranks after  London
Heathrow  and Paris Charles de Gaulle among European hubs, rose
3.4 percent to 27.4 million during the six months. The group-
wide total increased 2.8 percent to 44.2 million.  Lufthansa’s quarterly operating profit jumped almost 28
percent to 361 million euros, beating analyst estimates, as the
effects of a 1.5 billion-euro efficiency program kicked in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
