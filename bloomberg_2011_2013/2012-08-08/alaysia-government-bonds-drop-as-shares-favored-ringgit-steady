Malaysia’s 10-year bonds dropped,
pushing the yield to a one-week high, on speculation investors
are favoring riskier assets such as stocks amid signs the
economy is improving.  Exports rose 5.4 percent in June from a year earlier, after
climbing 6.7 percent in May, the government reported today. That
beat the 3.1 percent gain estimated by economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The central bank forecasts the economy will grow as
much as 5 percent this year, compared with 5.1 percent in 2011.
Foreign funds bought 3.3 billion ringgit ($1.1 billion) of local
shares in July, the most since March, exchange data show.  “Bonds are falling because investors see opportunities in
equities,” said Yeah Kim Leng, chief economist at RAM Holdings
Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “If growth prospects improve, yields
could rise further.”  The yield on the 3.418 percent notes due August 2022
increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.41
percent as of 4:39 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to Bursa
Malaysia. That was the highest level since Aug. 2.  The ringgit declined 0.2 percent to 3.1040 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, rose five basis points to 6.30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
