Bank of Thailand  Chairman Virabongsa
Ramangkura comments on inflation targeting. He made the remarks
during a speech late yesterday in Bangkok.  Thailand ’s central bank has used inflation targets since
2000 and aims to keep  core inflation , which excludes fresh food
and fuel prices, between 0.5 percent and 3 percent.  “Central banks should change their ideas. Inflation
targeting is no longer effective because inflation has been
globalized. The world is more open and we are a member of the
 World Trade Organization . Commodity prices are driven by global
supply and demand, not policy of a particular country.  ‘‘So monetary policy shouldn’t be used to deal with
inflation because we can’t do anything. Monetary policy should
be used to support economic growth and reduce unemployment,
which we call inclusive growth.”  “The source of instability for emerging countries is
foreign exchange, not inflation. The stability of the foreign
 exchange rate  depends on capital movements. If our  interest
rates  are higher than dollar rates, that will open a loophole
for attackers. This creates financial instability. So, monetary
policy should take care of this, not inflation.”  Virabongsa says his views run counter to those of Governor
Prasarn Trairatvorakul.  “Still, we can work together,” he said. “I already sold
this idea to the governor, but he hasn’t respond yet.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
