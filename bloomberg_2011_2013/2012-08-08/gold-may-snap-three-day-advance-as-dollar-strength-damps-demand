Gold advanced for the third time in
four sessions on speculation that central banks will take steps
to bolster their economies, increasing the appeal of the
precious metal as a store of value.  Investors expect European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  to flesh out a plan to shore up Spanish and Italian
bonds. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  started a two-day policy meeting amid
speculation that it may weigh alternative monetary policy, and
China’s yuan climbed to a one-week high against the dollar on
bets that the government will take steps to revive economic
growth.  “The notion that there could be some kind of coordinated
action by central banks is boosting gold,” Matt Zeman, a
strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,616 an ounce at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The price has climbed 1.6 percent since Aug. 2.  Federal Reserve President  Ben S. Bernanke  may discuss
policy options during an Aug. 31 speech in  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming. Today’s gold rally was limited after Fed Bank of Dallas
President  Richard Fisher  said adequate economic stimulus already
is in place.  The metal surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008
to June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing.  Silver futures for September delivery declined less than
0.1 percent to $28.075 an ounce in New York.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
October delivery fell 20 cents to $1,410.20 an ounce. Palladium
futures for September delivery slipped 0.3 percent to $586.50 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
