The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in Australia and Japan from non-payment increased, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia  index  rose 1 basis point to
158.5 basis points as of 10:10 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The gauge changed direction yesterday after
falling 12.4 basis points over the two previous trading days to
155.9, its lowest since May 3, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan  index  advanced 1 basis point to
205.5 as of 9:42 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
measure has climbed every day since Aug. 1, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market. Itâ€™s ranged 136.2
basis points to 217.3 basis points this year.  The Markit iTraxx Asia  index  of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 149.5 as of 8:31
a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The index has traded 148.7 basis points to 175.3 basis points
this quarter, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
