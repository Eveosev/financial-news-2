Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
will cooperate with the party of his predecessor,  Silvio Berlusconi , to consider a plan for selling state-owned assets.  Monti and Finance Minister Vittorio Grilli “expressed
their appreciation for the willingness” of Berlusconi’s People
of Liberty party to cooperate with the government in evaluating
timing and approaches, the prime minister’s office said today in
an e-mailed statement. Monti met earlier with PDL Secretary
General Angelino Alfano.  Monti, who raised taxes and curbed spending to rein in
Italy’s budget deficit, is turning to asset sales to help bring
down public debt. The government plans to sell state-run
companies, real estate and utilities controlled by
municipalities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
