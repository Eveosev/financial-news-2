Poland’s government will have to
revise down its 2013 economic-growth forecast to “probably”
below 2.5 percent,  Ludwik Kotecki , chief economist at the
Warsaw-based Finance Ministry, said today in an interview on
Radio Tok FM.  “As the data from the European Union get worse, we
need to adjust our growth forecast,” Kotecki said. “Instead of
accelerating growth, we will see a slowdown to probably below
2.5 percent, but probably not less than 2 percent.”  Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s Cabinet approved in June a
2013 budget plan assuming economic growth will accelerate to 2.9
percent from 2.5 percent this year. Eight of the euro area’s 17
nations are in recession, while the bloc’s manufacturing gauge
fell to a 37-month low in June, according to an Aug. 1 report by
London-based Markit Economics.  The  Finance Ministry  will finish revising next year’s draft
budget at the end of this month, Kotecki said.  The government’s
2.5 percent forecast for GDP growth this year “is not at
risk,” he said.  The zloty fell to 4.0789 per euro at 4:41 p.m. in Warsaw,
weakening for a second day from a one-year high reached on Aug.
6. The yield on the  10-year government bond  rose 2 basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.88 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
