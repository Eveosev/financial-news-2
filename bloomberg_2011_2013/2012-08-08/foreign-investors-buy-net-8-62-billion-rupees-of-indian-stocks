Overseas investors bought a net  8.62
billion rupees  ($155.3 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
raising their investment in the equities this year to 556
billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 24.5 billion rupees of shares and sold
15.9 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. They invested 102.7 billion rupees in
stocks last month.  Foreign funds sold a net 8.17 billion rupees of bonds,
paring inflow into debt this year to 237.5 billion rupees, the
data show.  India’s $1.1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Flows surged to a record
in 2010, making the BSE India Sensitive Index the best performer
among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in
2008 led to the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreigners have invested 4.999 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.445 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
