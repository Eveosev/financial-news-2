Apax Partners LLP, the buyout firm
that’s raising  Europe ’s largest fund, posted a 111.4 million-
pound ($174 million) profit last year that will be shared among
58 partners.  Profit available for discretionary division among partners
advanced 17 percent for the year ended March 31 from the
previous year’s 95.5 million pounds, according to a July 31
regulatory filing. The partner “with the highest entitlement to
profit” received 12.7 million pounds, up from 12.25 million
pounds the year before.  Georgiana Brunner, a spokeswoman for Apax, declined to
comment beyond the filing.  Apax is headed by Chief Executive Officer Martin Halusa and
had 58 so-called members, or partners, listed for the fiscal
year. The buyout firm, which owns companies including mobile-
phone operator Orange Switzerland and British retailer New Look
Group Ltd., is seeking 9 billion euros ($11 billion) to buy
companies, primarily in Europe.  The firm spent 2.7 billion euros last year, up from 2.2
billion euros in 2010, according to its annual report released
in June. It reaped 2.1 billion euros from selling assets in
2011, down from 3 billion euros in the year-earlier period.  Apax’s 11.2 billion-euro fund, raised in 2007, posted a 10
percent gain as of Dec. 31, 2011, according to a report by
Washington State Investment Board, one of the firm’s investors.  Euro Concern  Buyout firms have led $61 billion of deals in Europe this
year, according to Bloomberg data, a 23 percent decline from the
same period last year as the sovereign-debt crisis hampers
mergers and acquisitions.  Apax, which in March had secured a little less than half of
its fundraising target, is giving the new fund’s clients the
option of investing in dollars after some of them expressed
concern over the fate of Europe’s common currency, people
familiar with the matter said last month.  “The economic fundamentals of the core euro zone countries
remain strong,” Halusa wrote in June’s annual report. “A
collapse of the euro is extremely unlikely. The more likely
scenario is the emergence of a more unified political entity.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
