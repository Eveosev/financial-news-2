Chimei Innolux Corp. (3481)  climbed the most
in more than four months in Taipei trading after reporting its
narrowest  loss  in seven quarters and forecasting stronger
shipments this quarter.  Taiwan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal displays  added  7
percent to NT$9.19 as of 10:14 a.m. local time, headed for its
biggest gain since March 28. The benchmark  Taiex (TWSE)  index rose 0.5
percent.  Chimei Innolux yesterday said its second-quarter net loss
dropped to NT$9.57 billion ($320 million), narrower than the
than NT$13.4 billion loss a year earlier and the NT$9.8 billion
average of analyst estimates. Shipments will improve this
quarter while the manufacturer aims to boost  profitability  by
reducing spending and focusing on its main businesses, it said.  “We expect Q3 gross margin to trend towards break-even
level due to higher utilization rates and seasonality effects,”
Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who rates the
stock outperform, wrote in a report. “We view CMI’s strategic
plan of trimming down its lamination business and strengthening
its core operation as positive in pursuit of returning to
profitability in the mid-term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
