Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained for
an eighth day, pushing the yield to a seven-week low, on
speculation  interest rates  will drop further as inflation slows.
The dong was little changed.  Consumer-price gains eased to 5.35 percent in July, a 32-
month low, according to government data. The central bank has
cut its key refinance rate five times this year to 10 percent
from 15 percent to help stimulate the economy.  “Interest rates are expected to continue to fall as
inflation remains under control,” Bank for Investment &
Development of Vietnam analysts including Hanoi-based Hoang Nu
Ngoc Thuy and Nguyen Thu Linh, wrote in a research note
yesterday. Yields will only drop slightly or stay at current
levels because the “supply of bonds will still be very large”
due to the State Treasury’s plan to sell about 40 trillion dong
($1.9 billion) of new securities before year-end, they wrote.  The yield on the benchmark notes fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 9.67 percent, the lowest level since
June 18, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong was little changed at 20,858 per dollar as of 3:58
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 State Bank  of Vietnam set the currency’s reference rate at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
dong is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
