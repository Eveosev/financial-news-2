The  Federal Reserve  extended until
Oct. 22 the comment period on three proposals for revising and
replacing bank capital rules.  “The comment period was extended to allow interested
persons more time to understand, evaluate and prepare comments
on the proposals,” the Federal Reserve Board said today in a
statement. The comment period was scheduled to end on Sept. 7.  The proposals would implement international bank capital
reforms known as Basel III, and some aspects of the Dodd-Frank
Act.  To contact the reporter on this story:
