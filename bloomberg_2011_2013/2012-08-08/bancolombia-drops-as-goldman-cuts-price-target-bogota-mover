Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) , the country’s biggest
lender, dropped to a two-year low after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said it sees a “rough road ahead” for the company and cut its
price target.  The shares dropped 1.7 percent to 24,780 pesos at 3:42 p.m.
in Santiago and earlier declined 4 percent to 24,220, the lowest
intraday price since July 2010. Bancolombia has retreated 10
percent since reporting a surprise decrease in second-quarter
profit on Aug. 1.  Goldman Sachs cut the target price on Bancolombia’s
American Depositary Receipts by 9.6 percent to $62.10 as
analysts led by Carlos G. Macedo cited lower loan growth
estimates and an increase in provisions for bad loans.  “We continue to see a rough road ahead for Bancolombia,”
the analysts wrote, with “little risk-adjusted upside,
particularly if the near-term outlook remains as difficult” as
indicated by the second-quarter results.  Net income fell 8 percent in the three months through June
to 354.5 billion pesos ($198.4 million), surprising analysts
whose average projection was for an adjusted profit of 414
billion pesos, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
bank forecasts loan growth at the lower end of a 10 percent to
15 percent range this year, officials said on an Aug. 2
conference call.  Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores SA , the banking group
controlled by billionaire  Luis Carlos Sarmiento  Angulo, overtook
Bancolombia’s market value on Aug. 3 for the first time since
March to become the country’s second-biggest company after
Ecopetrol SA. Bancolombia’s capitalization fell below Aval’s
again today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
