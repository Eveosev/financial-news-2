Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST)  fell in late
trading after second-quarter profit and sales trailed analysts’
estimates as costs increased.  The shares tumbled 10 percent to $61 at 5:32 p.m. in  New
York . The Corona, California-based company’s stock had gained 47
percent this year through the close of regular trading today.  Second-quarter profit was 59 cents a share, the company
said in a statement today. The average of nine analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 61 cents a share. Sales rose
28 percent to $592.6 million, trailing analysts’ average
projection of $595.9 million.  “When you trade at a high multiple, you can’t miss,”
Damian Witkowski, an analyst with Gabelli & Co., said in a
telephone interview.  Monster trades at about 38 times earnings, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg. Coca-Cola Co., the world’s largest
soft-drinks maker, trades at 20 times earnings.  Monster and Atlanta-based Coca-Cola are facing higher costs
for ingredients such as sweeteners and plastic for bottles. The
cost of sales at Monster rose 31 percent to $285.6 million in
the quarter. While costs rose, profit was up 30 percent in the
quarter to $109.8 million.  “Costs were up, but earnings were still strong,”
Witkowski said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
