(Corrects spelling of chairman’s name in third paragraph.)  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ,
the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, nominated Galia Maor, the former Bank Leumi Le- Israel  Ltd. chief executive
officer, to its board of directors.  The company will ask shareholders to approve the nomination
at a Sept. 12 meeting, Teva said in a filing. Maor stepped down
as CEO of Israel’s largest lender by assets this year after 16
years in the role, in which she was one of the nation’s most
prominent female business leaders.  Maor may be a candidate to replace  Phillip Frost  as
chairman of Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, Maariv reported on
July 25. Maor has the support of directors Amir Elstein and
Chaim Hurvitz, the newspaper said, citing people at Teva it
didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
