Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB  fell the most
in more than a month after sales increased less than expected in
July, signaling that  Latin America ’s largest retailer could be
losing market share.  The stock fell 2.9 percent, erasing this year’s gain, to
37.91 pesos at the close of trading in  Mexico  City, the steepest
decline since since June 21. The benchmark IPC index decreased
0.5 percent.  Same-store sales rose 1.2 percent in July, the company said
in a statement to the Mexican stock exchange yesterday. That
compares with Grupo Bursatil Mexicano’s 2.1 percent estimate,
analyst Luis Willard said in a phone interview from Mexico City.  “Competitors are being very aggressive when it comes to
pricing,” Willard said. “This has translated into weak
customer traffic for Walmex.”  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s Mexico subsidiary competes with
national retail chains including  Organizacion Soriana SAB (SORIANAB)  and
 Controladora Comercial Mexicana SAB. (COMERUBC)   GBM, as the Mexico City-based brokerage is known, cut Wal-
Mart de Mexico to the equivalent of hold from buy yesterday.  Wal-Mart de Mexico has fallen 0.8 percent so far this year,
compared with the benchmark’s 10 percent advance in the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
