Peru  and  Ecuador  are planning a joint
venture to explore for oil on the Ecuadorean side of their
shared border 13 years after signing a peace accord that ended
more than a century of conflict.  Petroleos del Peru SA  and PetroEcuador, the nations’ state-
owned oil companies, are seeking a partnership to participate in
bidding for new oil concessions in southeastern Ecuador
scheduled for October, Ecuador’s Non-Renewable Natural Resources
Minister Wilson Pastor said today to reporters in Quito. The two
countries also signed a $300 million agreement to connect their
oil pipelines to carry Ecuadorean crude to Peru’s northern port
of Bayovar, he said.  The pipeline deal and planned joint venture are fruits of
the 1998 peace accord which ended border wars dating from the
19th century, Pastor said. The pipeline will take three years to
build and will attract investors into bidding for the
exploration blocks in Ecuador’s Amazon rainforest, he said.  “Today things have changed because there is a very
different attitude between our governments after the peace on
the border,” Pastor said at a signing ceremony for the pipeline
deal. “Now we intend to make the Amazon basin’s oil
infrastructure an example of energy integration.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
