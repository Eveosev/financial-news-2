MiaSole Inc., a closely held
manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, cut an unspecified
number of manufacturing jobs to conserve cash as it pursues
potential partners.  “MiaSole will reorganize its workforce to retain employees
in the technology, commercial and flexible product areas and
make reductions in manufacturing and operations,” the  Santa
Clara , California-based company said in a  statement  yesterday on
its website.  MiaSole in March received $55 million in funding from
investors to reduce manufacturing costs, and Chief Executive
Officer John Carrington is in discussions with potential
partners to increase efficiency and expand sales according to
the release.  “I am confident based on current discussions we will
finalize a partnership within the next 60-90 days,” he said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
