Usain Bolt, who successfully defended
his 100-meter Olympic title, moved to within a victory of 
retaining his 200-meter crown at the  London  games.  Bolt, a 25-year-old from  Jamaica , eased through the final
stages of the second semifinal of the 200-meters in 20.18 
seconds. His training partner Yohan Blake, silver medalist
in the Aug. 5 100-meter final, also made it through. Blake beat 
Bolt in both the 100 and 200 meters at Jamaica’s trials.  Bolt’s time made him the 5th fastest qualifier. Blake was
quickest, running 20.01 seconds.  Wallace Spearmon of the U.S. and European 100-meter
champion Christophe Lemaitre also made it through to tomorrow
night’s final at London’s Olympic Stadium.   To contact the reporter on this story:
