Kuban Agroholding, an agricultural
company controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s Basic
Element, killed a herd of 2,209 pigs after its second African
Swine Fever outbreak in 12 days, the company said.  A veterinary commission is investigating the farm in the
town of Ust-Labinsk in  Russia ’s southern Krasnodar region. In
the first outbreak at another farm in the same town on July 26,
all 5,600 pigs were slaughtered, according to company data.
There have been more than 20 outbreaks to date this year in the
country, according to Rosselkhoznadzor, the nation’s food safety
watchdog.  Krasnodar authorities have set up checkpoints on roads in
the Ust-Labinsk area, closed markets and killed all of the pigs
in private households in the risk zone around the town, Kuban
Agroholding said in an e-mailed statement today.  “These measures are insufficient,” the company said.
“Even large agricultural companies are unable to stop this
disaster on their own. Effective and tough measures by the state
are required.” The company wants testing equipment to be
provided and stricter control over  animal feed  and vehicles that
transport pigs and pork.  ASF is a viral disease for which there is no vaccine. It’s
deadly for pigs and harmless for humans, according to the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
