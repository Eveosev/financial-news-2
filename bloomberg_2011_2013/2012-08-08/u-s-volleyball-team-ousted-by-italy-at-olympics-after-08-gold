The U.S. men’s volleyball team was
eliminated by Italy in an Olympic quarterfinal match, ending its
chances for a second straight gold medal.  The U.S., which went 4-1 in qualifying play and reached the
knockout stage as the top seed from its group, was upset by
Italy 28-26, 25-20, 25-20 in  London . Italy advances to face the
2008 silver medalist,  Brazil , in the semifinals.  Brazil, which won gold medals in 1992 and 2004, beat
Argentina 25-19, 25-17, 25-20 to win its quarterfinal match.  At the 2008 Olympics, the U.S. beat Brazil for its first
gold medal in men’s volleyball in 20 years. The victory, on the
final day of the Beijing Games, came 15 days after the father-
in-law of then-coach Hugh McCutcheon was stabbed to death while
visiting a tourist site in the city with his wife and daughter.  Italy’s team took the silver medal at the 1996 and 2004
Olympics, and the bronze medal at the 2000 Sydney Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
