The yield on Ghana’s $750 million
Eurobond will probably fall to a record low this year as the
West African nation benefits from strong exports and a smooth
leadership transition,  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)  said.  The yield on the 8.5 percent bond due 2017 may fall to 5
percent, Angus Downie, London-based head of economic research at
Ecobank, said in an e-mailed note today. The bond was issued in
September 2007.  The forecast reflects “several positive macroeconomic”
factors including demand for exports of cocoa, gold, timber and
oil, “although there are downsides related to the fiscal
position/public financial management, and the  exchange rate .”
Downie said. “The smooth transition of power to President
Mahama is also a positive factor for investors to focus on.”  Ghana’s Eurobond fell for a ninth day, dropping 14 basis
points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 5.358 percent as of 2:47
p.m. in the capital, Accra.  Former Vice President John Dramani Mahama was sworn in as
leader on July 24 following the death of President John Atta
Mills earlier that day. Former Bank of  Ghana  Governor Kwesi Amissah-Arthur was sworn in as the new vice president on Aug. 6.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
