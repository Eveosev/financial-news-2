The ruble retreated versus the dollar
for a second day as the price of crude oil,  Russia ’s main export
earner, declined.  The Russian currency slid 0.6 percent to 31.7800 as of 2:22
p.m. in Moscow. The ruble weakened 0.2 percent against the euro
to 39.2814 and 0.4 percent versus the central bank’s target
euro-dollar basket to 35.1548.  Crude fell 0.8 percent in  New York  to $92.95 a barrel as
investors sold contracts on speculation recent gains were
excessive amid signs of flagging demand in the U.S. Oil in
 London  dropped 1 percent, snapping a three-day rally. Crude and
natural gas contribute about 50 percent of Russian state
revenue, according to government estimates.  Ruble is retreating from the strongest in two months
against the dollar as oil slid and the euro weakens versus the
dollar today, Peter Neimyshev, head of foreign exchange at
Otkritie Bank in Moscow, said by telephone. The Russian currency
may drop to 31.90 rubles to 32 rubles per dollar this week
should  Brent crude  fall further to below $111 a barrel, he said.  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 32.1149 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 32.0550 per
dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
