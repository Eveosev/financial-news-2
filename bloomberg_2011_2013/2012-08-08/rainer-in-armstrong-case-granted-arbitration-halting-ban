Former U.S. Postal Service Pro-
Cycling Team trainer Jose Marti had his lifetime ban from the
sport suspended to allow for an arbitration hearing in the
doping conspiracy case that includes seven-time Tour de France
winner  Lance Armstrong .  Armstrong, Marti, team manager  Johan Bruyneel  and two team
doctors initially had until July 10 to tell the  Colorado
Springs , Colorado-based United States Anti-Doping Agency whether
they desired to move forward with arbitration. Marti and the
doctors were banned after failing to comply.  “After the announcement was made, representatives for Mr.
Marti contacted Usada and said that Mr. Marti wanted to have his
case heard in the arbitration process,” the agency said in an
e-mailed statement today. “In an effort to ensure Mr. Marti has
the opportunity to fully exercise his rights under the rules,
Usada has agreed to move forward with arbitration in Mr. Marti’s
case.”  After being given an extension Bruyneel, currently the
RadioShack Nissan Trek cycling team manager, decided to have his
case heard by the independent panel of arbitrators. Armstrong is
seeking a U.S. court order blocking Usada from forcing him into
arbitration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
