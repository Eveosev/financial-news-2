Firms in  London ’s financial district
must root out lawbreakers and stop flouting international rules
or else the city will lose business to New York, said Mark Field, who represents the area in the British parliament.  “Politicians in the U.S. will be keen not to take any
prisoners as they trawl for fresh targets” in an election year,
Field, a member of the governing Conservatives, said in an e-
mailed response to questions. “Many in  Wall Street  recognize an
irresistible opportunity unfairly to discredit the City of
London as a whole, in order to claw back some of the market
share in financial services that New York had lost.”  New York regulators yesterday accused  Standard Chartered
Plc (STAN)  of violating money-laundering laws. The probe follows last
month’s Senate finding that  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  gave terrorists
and criminals access to the U.S. financial system, resulting in
a $700 million provision for fines, and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
trading loss of at least $5.8 billion at a London-based unit.  -- Editors:  Keith Campbell , Jon Menon  To contact the reporter on this story:
