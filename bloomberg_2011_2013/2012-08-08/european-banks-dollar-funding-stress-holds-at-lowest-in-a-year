European banks’ reluctance to lend to
one another held at the lowest level in more than a year,
according to a money-market indicator.  The  Euribor-OIS spread , the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 29 basis
points at 8:45 a.m. in  London , data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The measure is at the lowest levels since July 22, 2011,
signaling banks are more willing to lend.  An estimate of future average overnight borrowing costs in
euros, the three-month Eonia OIS swap, was little changed at 7.7
basis points. The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight
indexed average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at
11.1 basis points yesterday from 10.9 basis points the day
before.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars fell to the lowest since July 26, 2011. The three-month
cross-currency basis swap was 35.5 basis points below Euribor
from minus 38 yesterday. The one-year  basis swap  was 40 basis
points less than Euribor from minus 41.5. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-
based  European Central Bank  yesterday, placing 317 billion euros
($392 billion) with the bank from 312 billion euros the day
before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
