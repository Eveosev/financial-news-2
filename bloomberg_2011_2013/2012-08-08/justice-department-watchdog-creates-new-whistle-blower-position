Whistle-blowers inside the U.S.
Justice Department have a new ally.  Michael Horowitz, the department’s inspector general, today
announced the creation of a “Whistle-blower Ombudsperson,” a
role designed to increase the attention paid to whistle-blowers,
as well as providing a new level of protection from retaliation.  “Whistle-blowers play a critical role in uncovering waste,
fraud, abuse, and mismanagement and this new position will
enable the OIG to continue its leadership as a strong and
independent voice within the  Department of Justice  on whistle-
blower issues,” Horowitz said in a statement.  Robert Storch, who recently joined the inspector general’s
office as a counselor, will serve in the new position.  Horowitz, who was confirmed by the Senate in April, said
that in the short time he has been in the role he has seen the
benefits of whistle-blowers within the department.  The new position will have oversight over all of the
Justice Department whistle-blower complaints and will be
responsible for ensuring that the inspector general reviews and
responds to each one. The official also will monitor
investigations into retaliation claims and serve as the office’s
liaison to other agencies and outside advocacy groups.  Horowitz is now in the middle of an investigation of the
shuttered Fast and Furious program, the failed law enforcement
border operation that allowed gun purchases in the U.S. in an
effort to trace the weapons to Mexican drug cartels. Whistle-
blowers helped bring that case to the attention of lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
