Jordan will this month choose a
company to transport 10,000 barrels of Iraqi crude a day by
truck, said Fayez Abu Gahud, a spokesman for the Energy
Ministry.  “The tenders committee is currently looking into financial
bids submitted to the energy ministry and will announce the
winning bidder as soon as possible to start the transfer of
Iraqi oil to Jordan,” he said by phone in Amman. Supplies from
 Iraq  have been stopped since Aug. 1, pending the selection of a
new carrier as the previous contract ended July 31, he said.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports more than 90 percent of its oil and relies on foreign
investment and grants to support its budget and current account
deficits. The kingdom’s power plants have had to switch to more
expensive fuels such as diesel after repeated interruptions in
natural-gas supplies caused by sabotage of the export pipeline
in neighboring  Egypt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
