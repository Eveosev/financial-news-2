G4S Plc (GFS)  Chief Executive Officer Nick Buckles said he had considered resigning over the company’s
failure to provide enough staff for London’s Olympic Games, the
Sunday Telegraph reported, citing an interview.  Buckles told the Telegraph he needs “to make sure” the
company delivers the Olympic contract before his future as a CEO
is decided by the shareholders, the newspaper reported. He is
“very committed to staying” after 27 years with the G4S, the
newspaper said, citing the CEO. Buckles, who earns a base salary
of 830,000 pounds ($1.3 million) a year, won’t take a bonus in
2012, according to the newspaper.  G4S said June 13 it expects to lose as much as 50 million
pounds on its contract after the government said it will deploy
3,500 extra soldiers to provide security to meet the staffing
shortfall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
