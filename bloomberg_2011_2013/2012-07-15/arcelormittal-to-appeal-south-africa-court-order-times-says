ArcelorMittal (MT)  plans to appeal a
South African court ruling that requires the steelmaker to
invest 241 million rand ($29 million) in the Kalagadi Manganese
project, the Sunday Times reported.  The steelmaker stopped funding the project last year after
it disagreed with how contracts for suppliers were awarded, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing the company and court
documents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
