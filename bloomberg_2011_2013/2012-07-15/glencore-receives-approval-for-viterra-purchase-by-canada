Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , the
world’s largest publicly traded commodities supplier, said it
received approval from the Canadian government for its
acquisition of grain handler  Viterra Inc. (VT)   “We are very pleased to receive Investment Canada (Act)
approval, which recognizes the long term benefits for farmers
and Canada from our acquisition of Viterra,” Glencore director
of Agricultural Products Chris Mahoney said today in a
statement.  Glencore has been working with the government since the
C$6.1 billion ($6.01 billion) transaction was announced in
March. The Baar, Switzerland-based company has agreed to
increase Viterra’s capital expenditures in Canada by more than
C$100 million over five years and contribute to “grain industry
initiatives” in the province of Manitoba.  Glencore has also agreed to maintain an office in Regina,
Saskatchewan, as the head of its North American agricultural
operations.  In 2010,  Canada ’s federal government rejected a $40 billion
hostile bid by Melbourne-based BHP Billiton Ltd. for Potash
Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., saying the proposal for the world’s
largest potash miner didn’t provide a “net benefit” for the
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
