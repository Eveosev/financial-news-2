Italy ’s new solar-power policy may
prompt renewable-energy companies to reduce investments in the
country, la Repubblica reported, citing an interview with Piero Manzoni, chief executive officer of  Falck Renewables SpA. (FKR)   The new rules, which include subsidy cuts for future
projects, introduce a number of bureaucratic obstacles
penalizing the industry, Repubblica cited Manzoni as saying. The
legislation, which will take effect Aug. 27, may push Falck and
other companies to invest elsewhere, he said, according to the
Rome-based newspaper.  Annual subsidies for photovoltaic energy in Italy surpassed
6 billion euros ($7.3 billion), the industry’s regulator GSE SpA
said in a July 12  statement . The new measures are designed to
rein in a boom in installations that’s made Italy the world’s
second-biggest solar market after  Germany  in less than two
years, the government said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
