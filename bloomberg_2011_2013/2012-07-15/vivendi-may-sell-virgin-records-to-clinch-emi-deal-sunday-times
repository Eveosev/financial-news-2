Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s  Universal Music Group 
is considering selling music labels such as Virgin Records to
win regulatory approval for the 1.2 billion-pound ($1.9 billion)
takeover of EMI Group, said a person with knowledge of the
matter.  Other labels that could be offered for sale  include EMI
Classics ,  Capitol Records  and  Parlophone Records , said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the plans are not
public. Universal will present potential concessions to European
competition regulators in Brussels this week, the person said.  Universal would be almost twice the size of the next
largest music company in the region, European Union regulators
said in March when they started an in-depth probe into the EMI
deal. While the EU has blocked two mergers in the last two
years, it often seeks concessions from the companies to
eliminate antitrust concerns, including the sale of units.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  agreed in November to sell EMI Group’s
recorded-music and publishing businesses in separate
transactions. Universal will buy EMI’s record labels, home to
Katy Perry and Coldplay, and a Sony Corp.-led group that
includes billionaire David Geffen paid $2.2 billion for the
publishing unit, according to statements in November.  The European Commission last month sent Universal the list
of potential competition problems.  Details of Universal’s potential concessions were reported
by the Sunday Times yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
