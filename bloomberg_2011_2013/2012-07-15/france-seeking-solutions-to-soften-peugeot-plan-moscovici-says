French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said the government is “looking for solutions” to
help prop up car sales and soften  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ’s decision
to slash jobs and close a factory near Paris.  Europe’s second-biggest carmaker last week announced plans
to cut 14,000 jobs and shut an auto plant in France for the
first time in two decades to stem widening operating losses.  Moscovici and his colleagues will work to “greatly improve
the quality of this plan, which in its current state isn’t
acceptable,” the minister said today on Europe 1 radio, echoing
comments by President  Francois Hollande .  The government’s goal is to save more of Peugeot’s jobs,
ensure there are no forced firings, soften the blow for the
workers involved and keep the Aulnay plant operating as an
industrial site, Moscovici said. The government will also
announce measures on July 25 to boost French car sales and prop
up the entire auto sector.  “We are here to find solutions,” Moscovici said.
Hollande’s comments yesterday were meant to be “firm and
constructive” toward Peugeot. “I’m not here to destabilize,
I’m here to build,” Moscovici said.  Hollande yesterday said he would lean on Peugeot to rework
the plan, consider incentives to spur sales of environmentally
friendly cars and study the possibility of providing credit for
vehicle purchases, though he won’t adopt cash incentives as his
predecessor  Nicolas Sarkozy  did to counter a recession in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
