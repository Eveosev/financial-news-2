Bradley Wiggins of Britain kept the
overall lead in the  Tour de France  after a day marked by
punctures caused by metal tacks on the road.  Spain ’s Luis Leon
Sanchez won the 14th stage.  Race organizers confirmed that tacks were found on the road
and have begun an investigation into possible sabotage,
Eurosport said. A number of punctures were caused, the
broadcaster said, although the incident did not ultimately
affect the leaders’ race placings.        Today’s 191-kilometer (118-mile) route from Limoux to Foix
was the first in the Pyrenees and featured two category-one
climbs including the final Mur de Peguere, which had an incline
of 18 percent in places.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
