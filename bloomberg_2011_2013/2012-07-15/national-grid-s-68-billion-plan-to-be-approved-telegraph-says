Britain’s energy watchdog, Ofgem, is
expected to approve  National Grid Plc (NG/) ’s proposed spending of as
much as 44 billion pounds ($68.4 billion) on improving the
country’s energy infrastructure, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  National Grid’s proposal calls for more than 21 billion
pounds to be spent on its electricity transmission network and 9
billion pounds on gas pipelines, according to the report. The
announcement is “imminent,” the newspaper said, without saying
where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
