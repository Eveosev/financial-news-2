What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open on the Chicago Board
of Trade at 6 a.m. Singapore time.  -- Corn futures may open 8 cents a bushel lower on the CBOT
after light rains across parts of  Iowa  and as a rally to the
highest price in 10 months on July 13 may prompt some investors
to sell the grain, Lynette Tan, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte, said in an e-mail.  -- Soybean futures may open 9 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
on demand from  China  and concerns drought in the U.S. may harm
crops, Tan Said.  -- Wheat futures may open 21 cents lower on speculation crops
may suffer less from the drought in the U.S., she said.  To contact the reporter for this story: Phoebe Sedgman in
