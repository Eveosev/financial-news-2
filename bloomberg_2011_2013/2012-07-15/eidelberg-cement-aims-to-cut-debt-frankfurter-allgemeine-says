HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  seeks to reduce
its debt by about 16 percent to 6.5 billion euros ($7.96
billion) in an effort to boost its credit rating and share
price, the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  said, citing
an interview with Chief Executive Officer Bernd Scheifele.  Debt reduction  is the top priority and the time isn’t right
for bold acquisitions, the Frankfurt-based newspaper quoted
Scheifele as saying in today’s edition.  HeidelbergCement cut debt by 7 billion euros to 7.7 billion
euros in the four years ending 2011, Scheifele told the
newspaper. He didn’t say when the company aims to reach the
target of 6.5 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
