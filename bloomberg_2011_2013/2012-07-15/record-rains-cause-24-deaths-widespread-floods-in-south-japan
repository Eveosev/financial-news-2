The death toll from record rains in
southwestern  Japan  rose to at least 24 people with eight still
missing.  Two people were confirmed dead today in Fukuoka prefecture,
according to the Yomiuri newspaper.  Three days of downpours through yesterday triggered
landslides and flooding that forced almost a quarter of a
million to evacuate and disrupted transportation on the southern
main island of Kyushu.  The worst of the storm has passed, the Meteorological
Agency said today, while warning of localized thundershowers
through tomorrow.  A record 50.75 centimeters (20 inches) of rain fell in 24
hours in Aso city on the island yesterday, the agency said.  Torrential rains caused the collapse of 145 houses and
flooding of more than 800 residences, public broadcaster NHK
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
