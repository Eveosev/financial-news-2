Roman Herzog, a former president of
 Germany ’s supreme court, predicted that plaintiffs will fail to
block the start of the euro area’s permanent financial rescue
fund,  Wirtschaftswoche  reported, citing an interview.  Herzog, asked about lawsuits before the constitutional
court aimed at blocking German ratification of the European
Stability Mechanism, said Germany has transferred elements of
national sovereignty to the European Union in the past and this
case isn’t different, the magazine quoted him as saying.  The German constitution allows the government to take high
risks in an emergency, Herzog was quoted as saying.  Herzog was president, or chief judge, of the Federal
Constitutional Court between 1987 and 1994. He held the largely
ceremonial post of German president between 1994 and 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
