All 17 euro-area government leaders
don’t expect Italy to need a sovereign bailout, Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  was quoted as saying in an
interview with Der Spiegel.  If Italy did request a rescue, it would have to submit it
to existing European oversight procedures, the German weekly
quoted Juncker as saying in comments published today. He didn’t
elaborate on the oversight measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
