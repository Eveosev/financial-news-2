BASF SE (BAS) , the world´s largest
chemical maker, aims to invest more than 100 million euros
($122 million) in the development and distribution of battery
materials, a market dominated by Asian manufacturers.  The German company aims to be among the top three global
providers of materials for producing batteries and cells by
2020, Ralf Meixner, senior vice president for battery materials,
told reporters at BASF headquarters in Ludwigshafen on July 10.  The company is staggering the investment over six years
through 2016, Meixner said. Japanese companies are at the
forefront of battery material production but their market is
fragmented, according to Meixner. “In  Japan , we expect a
consolidation of companies as mid-sized firms will disappear,”
he said.  Among battery material manufacturers in Japan, Osaka-based
 Stella Chemifa Corp. (4109) ,  Asahi Kasei Corp. (3407)  in  Tokyo  and Fukui-based
 Tanaka Chemical Corp. (4080)  are the largest global providers of
electrolytes, separators and cathodes respectively, Andy Bae of
Pike Research LLC, said  on the Pike Research Blog.  Japanese
companies hold an almost 80 percent market share of the global
lithium-ion-battery market, according to Bae.  BASF has set up a new division for its battery activities
and acquired Merck KGaA’s battery electrolyte activities,
Novolyte Technologies, which makes electrolyte formulations for
 lithium-ion batteries  and specialty chemicals, as well as Ovonic
Battery Co. and Sion Power Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
