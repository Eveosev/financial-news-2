Danny Garcia of the U.S. stopped
Britain’s Amir Khan in the fourth round in  Las Vegas  last night
to take his opponent’s World Boxing Association light-
welterweight title.  Unbeaten Garcia, who also retained his World Boxing Council
crown, knocked Khan down three times before referee Kenny Bayless
ended the contest at the Mandalay Bay Events Center.  It was a second consecutive upset for Khan, who lost to
Lamont Peterson in December. In the other loss in his career, he
was knocked out by Colombia’s Breidis Prescott in September
2008.  At Upton Park in east London last night,  David Haye  beat
fellow Briton Dereck Chisora in a fifth-round stoppage. The non-
title heavyweight fight was licensed by the Luxembourg boxing
authority after the British sport’s ruling body refused the
approve it. It was billed as a grudge match after the pair
clashed at a press conference in Munich in February.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
