The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations fell 6.77 cents in the past
three weeks to $3.4103 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey
Inc.  The survey covers the three weeks ended July 13 and is
based on information received from about 2,500 stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company. The average is down 20.47
cents from a year earlier. Gasoline is 55.67 cents below the
year-to-date high of $3.9671 reached April 6.  “This maybe is it for the decline,”  Trilby Lundberg ,
president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. “Higher crude  oil prices  is one reason. And the
other reason is demand: Not only are we in the normal seasonal
surge for gasoline, but we are also increasing our demand year
over year. One reason for that is the price incentive.”  Prices at the pump fell as West Texas Intermediate crude
for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  jumped
$7.34, or 9.2 percent, in three weeks to $87.10 a barrel on July
13. Futures have declined 21 percent since reaching a year-to-
date settlement high of $109.77 on Feb. 24.  Gasoline Futures  Gasoline futures on the Nymex surged 24.62 cents, or 9.6
percent, in the three weeks ended July 13 to $2.8161. Gasoline
has lost 18 percent since reaching a year-to-date high of
$3.4166 on March 26.  Crude oil and gasoline have risen on speculation that a
struggling U.S. jobs market, Europe’s debt crisis and a slowdown
in  China  will prompt more fiscal easing to stimulate growth.  Chinese  gross domestic product  expanded at a three-year-low
7.6 percent last quarter from a year earlier, the  National
Bureau of Statistics  said July 13. Premier  Wen Jiabao  pledged to
intensify fine-tuning of policies as downward pressure on the
economy remains “relatively large,” according to a July 8
report by the official Xinhua News Agency.  Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta PresidentDennis Lockhart
said July 13 that the central bank may need to initiate a new
program of asset purchases if recent economic weakness persists
and undermines his forecast for a pickup in the second half of
the year.  Refinery Shutdowns  The policy-making  Federal Open Market Committee  voted last
month to extend its maturity extension program, known as
Operation Twist, and said it would consider additional stimulus
if needed.  Medley Global Advisors predicted in a July 13 report that
the  European Central Bank  will ease monetary policy further.
European leaders on June 29 eased repayment rules for Spanish
banks, alleviating concern that the region’s debt crisis will
spread and curb fuel demand.  Gasoline also has gained as refinery shutdowns tightened
stockpiles of summer-blend reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, in
 New York  Harbor. East Coast stockpiles of RBOB fell 5.3 percent
to 14.6 million barrels, 8.8 percent below a year earlier, in
the week ended July 6, according to  Energy Department data .  Oil may fall next week on concern that weaker economic
growth may reduce fuel demand, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Fourteen of 34 analysts, or 41 percent, forecast crude will
drop through July 20. Twelve respondents, or 35 percent,
predicted that futures will rise and eight said there will be
little change in prices. Last week, 48 percent of analysts
projected a gain.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline was $3.70 a gallon,
according to Lundberg. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged
$3.65.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed was in  Chicago , where the average was $3.78 a
gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Jackson,
Mississippi, where customers paid an average of $3 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
