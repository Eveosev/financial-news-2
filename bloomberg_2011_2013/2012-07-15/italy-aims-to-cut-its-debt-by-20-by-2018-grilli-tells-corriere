Italy  plans to sell public assets
valued at as much as 20 billion euros ($24.5 billion) annually
in order to cut its debt by one sixth within five years, Finance
Minister  Vittorio Grilli  told  Corriere della Sera  in an
interview published today.  Under the plan, the government would sell assets each year
worth as much as 1 percent of gross domestic product, Grilli
told the Milan-based newspaper. That and annual growth of 1
percent would enable Italy to reduce the public debt “by 20
percent within five years,” Corriere cited the minister as
saying.  Grilli also said that the Italian economy will contract
less than 2 percent this year, Corriere reported. That compares
with a 1.2 percent GDP contraction forecast by the government on
April 18.  Italy’s public debt rose to 120.1 percent of GDP in 2011
and is projected to reach 123.4 percent this year, the
government said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
