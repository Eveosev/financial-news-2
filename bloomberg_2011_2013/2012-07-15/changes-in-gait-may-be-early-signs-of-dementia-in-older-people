A slow or uneven gait in older
patients may be more than the effect of advancing age, according
to three studies that found walking disorders in the elderly
also may be early signs of Alzheimer’s disease.  The studies sampled a combined 4,000 people, finding that
pace, rhythm and the size of steps changed with neurological
illness, according to information presented at the  Alzheimer’s
Association International Conference  in  Vancouver .  Watching an older patient walk into an exam room may offer
a first clue that psychological evaluation needs to be done,
said  William Thies , chief medical and scientific officer for the
Chicago-based  Alzheimer’s Association . Since people with
Alzheimer’s are more likely to suffer a debilitating fall than
healthy peers, this simple observation may help patients get the
right care and prevent injury and disability.  “One of the attractions for me is that observing gait is
not particularly high-tech and can be done in simple ways,”
Thies said. “We have lots of primary care physicians sometimes
having difficulty picking out patients that need further
evaluation. This is a potential tool -- not for diagnosis, but
for knowing who needs more evaluation.”  One study of more 1,100 people with an average age of 77
found that people with  Alzheimer’s disease  walked more slowly
and with a more irregular pattern of steps as their minds
declined. Even people with a pre-Alzheimer’s condition, called
mild cognitive impairment, walked more sluggishly and variably
than the normal elderly, according to the study led by Stephanie
Bridenbaugh, from the Basel Mobility Center in  Switzerland .  Computerized Analysis  Bridenbaugh’s group used a computerized pad that patients
walk on to detect minute  variations in their gaits . While a
general practitioner probably wouldn’t have that available in
the office, asking patients to count backward by two while they
walked and observing any changes in their stride could be
helpful, she said. Though everyone walks more slowly while
counting backward, troubles with balance or an unusual stride
become more obvious when double-tasking.  Additionally, the double-task analysis may help doctors
figure out which adults are walking more slowly because of pain,
rather than brain changes, she said.  Another study of more than 1,200 people over age 49, found
that the rhythm of a person’s stride was associated with
information processing speed. The ability to control and
regulate behavior, called executive function, was associated
with stride length. Memory wasn’t correlated with any aspect of
walking, according to the study led by Mohammad Ikram, a
researcher at  Erasmus Medical Center  in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands.  Dementia Link  “Future studies should explore the link between gait and
dementia,” Ikram said. “Can we use gait to predict dementia?
If so, how long before cognitive symptoms?”  A third study evaluated patients over multiple visits. It
found that those who had slower steps and smaller strides had
larger declines in thinking, memory and executive processing,
according to the study led by Rodolfo Savica from the  Mayo
Clinic  in Rochester,  Minnesota .  “Motor and cognitive function may be part of the same
spectrum of the disease,” Savica said. “These motor changes
happen before the memory changes.”  Most older adults  walk more slowly  as they age, the doctors
said. Any analysis of a person’s stride should take into account
the full medical work-up, Savica said. It’s important to know
whether patients are walking more slowly because they have an
arthritic knee or a bone disease, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
