Boeing Co. (BA)  is pricing its 737 Max
plane aggressively to compete for market share with the Airbus
A320neo, Airbus SAS Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier was
quoted as saying by Welt am Sonntag.  Chicago-based Boeing may book more orders than Airbus this
year after pulling ahead of the Toulouse, France-based European
maker at the Farnborough air show in  England  this month, the
German newspaper cited Bregier as saying in an interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
