Fines for fixing the London
interbank offered rate will probably be more than 290 million
pounds ($452 million) for some of the other banks involved,  Sky
News   reported , citing a Barclays e-mail to staff sent July 13.  “As other banks settle with authorities, and their details
become public, and various governments’ inquiries shed more
light, our situation will eventually be put in perspective,”
the internal memorandum, co-authored by Barclays Chairman Marcus Agius, said, according to the website.  About 15 other lenders, including  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) 
and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  are under investigation,
Sky reported.  Simon Eaton, a London-based spokesman for Barclays,
declined to comment when reached by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
