Spain’s Luis Leon Sanchez won the
14th stage of cycling’s  Tour de France  today. Bradley Wiggins of
Britain kept the overall race lead.  Today’s 191-kilometer (118-mile) route from Limoux to Foix
was the first in the Pyrenees and featured steep climbs
including the category-one Mur de Peguere.  The stage was marked by several punctures and race
organizers are looking into unconfirmed reports that metal tacks
had been placed on the road, Eurosport reported.  Wiggins set a record today, becoming the first Briton to
hold the race-leader’s yellow jersey seven times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
