Italy’s state-owned lender Cassa
Depositi e Prestiti SpA will use a 20 billion-euro ($24.5
billion) loan obtained by the  European Central Bank  to support
the country’s economy, Chairman Franco Bassanini told  Il Sole 24
Ore  in an interview.  The lender used the ECB’s long-term financing operation
earlier this year to obtain the loan at a rate of 1 percent,
Bassanini was cited as saying in the interview. The CDP will use
the money to fund infrastructure projects and back small and
medium-size companies, Bassanini also said, according to Sole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
