The U.S. embassy in Bern has
compiled a report for the U.S. State Department on the possible
consequences of a lawsuit against  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  NZZ am
Sonntag  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The embassy conducted surveys at the end of March for the
report, inviting stakeholders and Swiss parliamentarians,
according to the newspaper. Credit Suisse is the only Swiss bank
for which such a report has been written recently, NZZ said.  Alex Daniels, a spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in Bern,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
