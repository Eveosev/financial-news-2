Oil from the  Gulf of Mexico  as a
proportion of U.S. output has fallen to a 14-year low as the
shale boom shakes up traditional production patterns, reducing
the impact of hurricanes on national supplies.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the Gulf will account for
21 percent of domestic output this year, the lowest level since
1998, based on Energy Department data. The Gulf represented 29
percent of production in 2009, the most since at least 1993.  Growth in output from shale-rock formations in the U.S.,
including the Bakken in North Dakota, has bolstered inland
supplies. North Dakota pumped 609,000 barrels of oil in April,
up 74 percent from a year earlier, according to  department data .  “The Gulf is becoming less important, and it reduces the
impact of storms,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of commodities
research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “Onshore production has
been rising while the Gulf of Mexico output has been falling,
and that really amplifies the percentage change.”  Oil prices  jumped 14 percent in August 2005 as  Hurricane
Katrina  shut platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Output from
federal waters in the Gulf will average 1.32 million barrels a
day this year, down 15 percent from 1.56 million in 2009, the
 Energy Department said  in its July 10 Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The U.S. will produce 6.31 million barrels of oil a day
this year, the highest level since 1997, according to department
estimates. Output in the lower 48 states, excluding the Gulf,
will average 4.45 million, up 41 percent from 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
