Liquefied natural gas imports by
 South Korea  rose 16 percent in June from a year earlier as the
average price paid for the fuel climbed 24 percent.  The world’s second-biggest LNG buyer, which imports almost
all its gas, purchased 2.45 million metric tons of the cleaner-
burning fuel last month, compared with 2.12 million tons a year
earlier, data on the Korea Customs Service’s  website  showed
today. Imports were 2.21 million tons in May.  South Korea paid $2.12 billion, or about $865 a ton, for
purchases in June, compared with $1.48 billion, or about $698 a
ton, a year earlier, the data showed.  The nation buys most of the fuel under multiyear contracts
from countries including Indonesia, Qatar, and Oman. Last
month’s purchases included 175,152 tons bought on the  spot
market  for $828.20 a ton from Nigeria, today’s data showed.  State-run  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest LNG buyer,
said on July 10 that June sales rose 3.2 percent from a year
earlier to 2.14 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
