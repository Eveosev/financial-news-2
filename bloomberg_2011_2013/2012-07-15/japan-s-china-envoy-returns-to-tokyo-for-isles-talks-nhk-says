Japanese Ambassador Uchiro Niwa left
China today to report to the government on recent developments
concerning disputed islands in the  East China Sea , public
broadcaster NHK reported.  Niwa told reporters at a Beijing airport that he would
discuss with Foreign Minister  Koichiro Gemba  the recent
intrusion of Chinese patrol ships into Japanese territorial
waters, NHK said. Niwa said no schedule has been set for his
return to Beijing.  Gemba told reporters in  Vietnam  yesterday that he wants to
discuss the matter in person with Niwa, NHK said.   Calls by Bloomberg News to the Japanese embassy in Beijing
and the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo were not answered.   The Senkaku islands, called Diaoyu in Chinese, are a flash
point between the world’s second- and third-largest economies.
Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara said in April he planned to buy
three of the uninhabited islands from a private Japanese
investor.   The Japanese government cautioned Niwa on June 7 for saying
in an interview with the Financial Times that Ishihara’s plan
could cause “an extremely grave crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
