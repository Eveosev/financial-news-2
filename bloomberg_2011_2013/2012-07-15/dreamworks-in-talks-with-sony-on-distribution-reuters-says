DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) , maker
of the “Shrek” series, is in talks with  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s movie
unit about distributing its films, Reuters reported, citing a
person with knowledge of the discussions it didn’t identify.  Viacom Inc.’s Paramount Pictures has rejected a request
from DreamWorks Animation Chief Executive  Jeffrey Katzenberg  to
lower the fee DreamWorks pays on film revenues generated at
movie theaters and from DVD sales to 7 percent from 8 percent,
Reuters said. Their agreement expires next year, Reuters said.  A phone call to Sony's Tokyo headquarters outside business
hours by Bloomberg News went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
