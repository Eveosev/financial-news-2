Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  reached an
agreement to cooperate with the European Commission in the
investigation into the manipulation of the London interbank
offered rate,  Der Spiegel  reported, without saying how it got
the information.  The aim is to keep penalties for Germanyâ€™s biggest bank
lower than they might otherwise be, the German weekly magazine
reported today.  Armin Niedermeier, a Deutsche Bank spokesman in Frankfurt,
declined to comment on the report when called by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
