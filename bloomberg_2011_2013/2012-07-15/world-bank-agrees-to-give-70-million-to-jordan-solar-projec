The  World Bank  agreed to give $70
million to Jordan to help finance a $600 million project to
create a solar power plant with a total generation capacity of
100 megawatts, Petra reported.  Jordan is seeking other resources to finance the rest of
the project, the official news agency reported, citing Minister
of Energy and Mineral Resources Alaa Batayneh.  Jordan, with one of the smallest economies in the Middle
East, imports almost all of its oil and relies on foreign
investment and grants to support its budget and current-account
deficits. The government has incurred losses by switching  power
plants  to more expensive fuels such as diesel after a natural-
 gas pipeline  from Egyptâ€™s Sinai region has been repeatedly
attacked by saboteurs since last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
