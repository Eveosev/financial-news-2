Representative Jesse Jackson Jr.
will probably return to Congress after treatment for a mood
disorder, Senate Democratic Whip  Richard Durbin  said.  “Members of Congress in both parties, men and women, go
through a lot of trials, physical and mental trials, and they
emerge from them stronger,” Durbin said today of his fellow
Illinois Democrat on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  Durbin said he couldn’t identify Jackson’s “specific
challenge.” Predictions that Jackson would leave the Illinois
congressional delegation are premature, he said.  “I wouldn’t say that at all,” Durbin said, responding to
whether Jackson would quit his political career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
