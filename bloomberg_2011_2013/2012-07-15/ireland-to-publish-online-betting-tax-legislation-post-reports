Ireland aims to publish legislation
this week to tax online betting with a 1 percent turnover tax on
Internet stakes and a 15 percent levy on commission from betting
exchanges, the  Sunday Business Post  reported.  The bill will be referred to the European Commission and
the minister for agriculture and food, Simon Coveney, said he is
confident the commission will sanction the tax in two to three
months, the Dublin-based newspaper reported. The taxes would
take effect at the start of 2013, the Post said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
