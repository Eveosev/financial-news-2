Taylor Teagarden returned from the
60-day disabled list to hit a walk-off two-run homer as the
 Baltimore Orioles ’ beat the Detroit Tigers 8-6 in 13 innings.  J.J. Hardy hit a solo home run to tie the score at 6-6 in
the 13th inning, before Teagarden’s shot into right field
yesterday gave Baltimore the win in a Major League Baseball
contest at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore. The victory
broke Detroit’s six-game winning streak.  Teagarden had missed the season with a strained back. He
was activated from the disabled list and entered yesterday’s
game after catcher Matt Wieters left for a pinch runner in the
10th inning.  Kevin Gregg (3-2), one of eight Oriole pitchers, hurled a
perfect one-third inning for the win.  Joaquin Benoit (1-2) took the loss as he gave up three runs
on two hits in the final inning.  The Orioles (46-41) are in second place, eight games behind
the  New York Yankees  in the five-team  American League East . The
Tigers (45-43) are in third place in the five-team AL Central, 3
½ games behind the  Chicago White Sox .  To contact the reporter on this story:
