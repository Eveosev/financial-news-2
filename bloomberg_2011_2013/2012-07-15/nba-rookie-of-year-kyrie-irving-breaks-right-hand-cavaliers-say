Cleveland  Cavaliers guard Kyrie
Irving, the reigning  National Basketball Association ’s rookie of
the year, broke his right hand during Summer League practice,
the team said.  Irving, 20, sustained a fracture after slapping the padding
on the wall when he committed a turnover during yesterday’s
morning practice at the NBA Summer League in  Las Vegas .  “It was just a freak accident,” Irving, the team’s top
scorer, told reporters. “I have to be more responsible about my
health. It was just crazy. It happened so fast.”  Irving, the No. 1 selection in the 2011 NBA draft, is
returning to Cleveland today where he will be evaluated at the
Cleveland Clinic Sports Health by the team physician.  The team said he most likely will be ready for the start of
the training camp in late September. A definitive schedule for
his return won’t be made until further evaluation of the
fracture, the team said.  Irving averaged 18.5 points, 5.4 assists and 3.7 assists
last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
