Absa Group Ltd. Chief Executive
Officer  Maria Ramos  said South African Finance Minister Pravin
Gordhan was being “unfair” when he called bankers “greedy
monsters,” the Sunday Times reported.  Absa Group is working to reduce fees and improve
transparency, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing
Ramos. Plans to cut 3,000 jobs include “natural attrition” and
restructuring, the newspaper said, citing Ramos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
