The euro declined toward a six-week
low against the yen before reports this week that economists
said will show European inflation stagnated in June and  consumer
confidence  in  Germany  declined this month.  The 17-nation currency fell for the fourth time in five
days versus the dollar after German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said she hasn’t softened her stance on measures to stem
contagion that’s prompted five  member states  to seek
international aid. A gauge of currency volatility dropped for a
sixth day to the lowest since April.  “Euro negativity is still pretty elevated,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce in  London . “There’s still a great deal of
uncertainty about how the European problems are going to be
worked through.”  The euro declined 0.3 percent to 96.68 yen at 9:31 a.m. in
London after falling to 96.43 yen on July 12, the lowest level
since June 1. The single currency dropped 0.2 percent to
$1.2228. It slid to $1.2163 on July 13, the weakest since June
2010. The yen gained 0.1 percent to 79.08 per dollar.  The euro has declined 4 percent in the past three months,
the worst performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen
advanced 5.9 percent, while the dollar gained 4 percent.  The rate of  inflation  in the euro area was unchanged in
June from the previous month, when it fell 0.1 percent,
according to Bloomberg News survey before the European Union’s
statistics office report. A gauge of  investor confidence  in
Germany, the region’s biggest economy, slid to minus 20 this
month from minus 16.9 in June, a separate survey showed ahead
of the data tomorrow.  ‘New Level’  A banking union involving a financial overseer for the euro
area will have to include joint oversight on a “new level,”
Merkel said yesterday in an interview with broadcaster ZDF in
Berlin. German lawmakers are scheduled to debate aid to
recapitalize Spanish banks this week.  The euro may drop to a support level at $1.2151 and then
toward the “psychologically important” level of $1.20,  Mitul Kotecha , head of global currency strategy at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in  Hong Kong , wrote in a note to
clients. Support is an area where buy orders may be clustered.  The $1.2151 level was last seen on June 14, 2010, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The euro last touched $1.20 on
June 10 the same year.  Euro Shorts  The difference in the number of wagers on a decline in the
euro compared with those on a gain, known as net shorts, was
165,705 on July 10 compared with 146,177 a week earlier,
according to figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. Traders have held net short positions in the
shared currency since last August, the data show.  The  implied volatility  of three-month options on Group of
Seven currencies fell to 9.06 percent, according to a JPMorgan
Chase & Co. measure, the lowest since April 30. Lower volatility
makes investments in currencies with higher benchmark lending
rates more attractive because the risk in such trades is that
market moves will erase profits.  Paul McCairn says the pound’s appreciation to a more than 3
1/2-year high against the euro is cutting profit at the
machinery manufacturer his father set up near Birmingham,
 England , in 1984.  ‘Less Competitive’  “We’ve got about 30,000 pounds ($46,620) of stock sitting
in a warehouse in Paris and I am watching that stock fall in
value,” McCairn, managing director of  Bri-Mac Engineering Ltd .,
which sells about 45 percent of the bearing housings it produces
abroad, said in a telephone interview on July 13. “It makes the
U.K. product, our product, less competitive and less attractive
for the French and the Germans to buy.”  Even with the U.K. in its first double-dip recession since
1975, exports to  Europe  falling and the  Bank of England  adding
to the supply of sterling by injecting 375 billion pounds of
stimulus, the pound rose 2.7 percent the past six months. That’s
the best performance of the basket of 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The pound was little changed today at 78.68 pence per euro
after appreciating to 78.54 pence, the strongest level since
Nov. 3, 2008. Sterling dropped 0.2 percent to $1.5540.  To contact the reporters on this story:
