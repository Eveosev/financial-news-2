David Price  became the first 12-game
winner in the  American League  as his Tampa Bay Rays defeated the
Boston  Red Sox  5-3 yesterday in a Major League Baseball contest.  Price (12-4) outpitched  Clay Buchholz , allowing three runs
on six hits in 7 1/3 innings. The Red Sox pitcher, who was
making his first appearance since recovering from esophagitis,
gave up four runs on three hits while striking out eight in 6
1/3 innings.  Jeff Keppinger scored on Elliott Johnson’s sacrifice fly in
the seventh to give the Rays a one-run advantage after Boston
reliever Matt Albers walked Luke Scott with the bases loaded to
tie the game at 3-3. B.J. Upton added an insurance run for the
Rays with an eighth inning solo homer.  Fernando Rodney got his 26th save after striking out two
and giving up one hit in the ninth at Tropicana Field in St.
Petersburg, Florida.  Will Middlebrooks hit a two-run homer in the third for the
Red Sox, and  Cody Ross  scored in the sixth on a throwing error
by Price to give Boston a 3-2 lead.  Buchholz (8-3), who pitched a no-hitter in his second MLB
start in 2007, was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 24
and hospitalized two days later with an inflammation that
damages tissues of the esophagus, the muscular tube that
delivers food from the mouth to the stomach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
