Peru ’s  economic  growth quickened in
May as domestic demand buffers the economy against weaker global
markets for the country’s copper and textiles.  Economic activity rose 6.5 percent from the same month a
year earlier, after a 4.4 percent expansion in April, the
government’s statistics agency said today in an e-mailed report.
Economists predicted growth of 5.3 percent, according to the
median estimate of 14 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  The government will spend the equivalent of 2.5 percent of
gross domestic product this year to protect Peru’s commodity-
dependent economy from slowing global growth. The Andean nation
posted its biggest  trade deficit  since 2008 in May as copper
prices fell and imports rose to a record.  “As long as domestic consumption remains strong, growth
should remain close to potential,” said Alejandro Arreaza, an
analyst at Barclays Plc, in a phone interview from  New York .  The central bank left borrowing costs unchanged at 4.25
percent for a 14th straight month July 12 as growth holds near
potential while consumer prices ease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
