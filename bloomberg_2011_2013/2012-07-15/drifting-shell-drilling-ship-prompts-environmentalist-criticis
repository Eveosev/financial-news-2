Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  faced
criticism from environmental activists after a drilling ship the
company plans to use for exploration in the U.S. Arctic drifted
toward shore.  The Noble Discoverer drifted toward the coast near Dutch
Harbor,  Alaska , Shell said today in an e-mail. The vessel was
re-positioned away from shore and there is no evidence of damage
or grounding, Coast Guard spokeswoman Sara Francis said today by
telephone from Kodiak, Alaska. While the reason for the mishap
hasn’t been determined, Dutch Harbor experienced high winds
yesterday, she said.  “Shell can’t keep its drill rig under control in a
protected harbor, so what will happen when it faces 20 foot
swells and sea ice while drilling in the Arctic?” Jackie
Dragon, Greenpeace lead Arctic campaigner, said in an e-mail
today. “Shell cannot be trusted,” and President  Barack Obama 
“should not let its Arctic drilling program move forward.”  Shell is waiting for a final permit from the Interior
Department to start exploration in the Arctic Beaufort and
Chukchi seas after investing about $4.5 billion in the fields
that may hold more than 20 billion barrels of oil.  Kelly op de Weegh, a spokeswoman for Shell, said the anchor
used to secure the ship off the coast is different from the
mooring system that will be used during drilling operations.  “Our goal remains flawless operations for offshore
Alaska,” she said. “We will evaluate why this anchor didn’t
hold.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
