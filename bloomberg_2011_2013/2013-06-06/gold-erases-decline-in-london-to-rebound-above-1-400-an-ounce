Gold futures advanced to a three-week
high as the dollar weakened against the euro and yen, increasing
demand for the precious metal as an alternative investment.
Platinum rose to the highest in almost eight weeks.  The euro strengthened to a three-month high as European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the region’s economy
should recover this year. The yen strengthened as much as 3.2
percent as traders unwound bets on a weaker Japanese currency
based on the Bank of  Japan ’s monetary stimulus plan. Gold has
slumped 16 percent in 2013, while the dollar climbed 2.2 percent
against a basket of major currencies.  “We are seeing gold finding support from a stronger
euro,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Archer
Financial Inc. in  Chicago . “It’s a currency play today.”  Gold futures for August delivery climbed 1.2 percent to
settle at $1,415.80 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1,423.30, the highest for a
most-active contract since May 15.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery advanced 1.2 percent to $1,529.30 an ounce.
Earlier, the price reached $1.534.50, the highest since April
12, partly amid labor strife at South African mines owned by
Lonmin Plc, the world’s third-biggest producer.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. is the top producer, followed
by Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 1 percent to $22.707
an ounce on the Comex. This year, the price has dropped 25
percent, the most among 24  raw materials  in the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose 0.8 percent
to $762.30 an ounce on the Nymex, the second straight advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
