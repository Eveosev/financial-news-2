East African Portland Cement Ltd.,
the smallest of  Kenya ’s three publicly traded makers of the
building material, jumped to the highest in a year on investor
speculation the company will declare a full-year profit.  The  stock  rose 4.3 percent to 61 shillings by the 3 p.m.
close in Nairobi, the capital, the highest level since June 22,
2012. The number of shares traded was 53 percent of the three-month daily average volume, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In February, the company said it recorded a first-half
profit of 327.2 million shillings ($3.84 million), compared with
a loss of 376.6 million shillings a year earlier, boosted by
lower cost of sales and financing expenses.  “There was notable improvement in the first-half and
expectations are that for full year they will return to
profit,” Eric Munywoki, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Old
Mutual Securities Ltd., said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
