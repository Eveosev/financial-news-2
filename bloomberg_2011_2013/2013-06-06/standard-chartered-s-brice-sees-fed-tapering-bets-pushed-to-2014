Investors will push back expectations
for the  Federal Reserve  to reduce its quantitative easing
stimulus program into next year, Steve Brice, the chief
investment strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in  Singapore ,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview today.  On timing of tapering QE:  “The FOMC members are moving towards a tapering of QE, but
we just feel the data is not quite there yet.”  “I really don’t feel that they’re going to be in a hurry
to move away from the current policy stance, and I think we’re
going to see some -- over the next three months or so -- people
backing off that expectation of tapering by September, and then
pushing it into Q1 next year.”  On Bernanke:  “I think people have actually misread Bernanke’s
comments.”  “If you look at his prepared comments a couple of weeks
ago, they were very dovish.”  On the  U.S. economy :  “Inflation data is still in a downtrend, so why would the
Fed tighten policy against that backdrop?”  “There are areas of strength and we are relatively upbeat
for the U.S. economy going forward -- looking for around 3
percent growth towards the end of this year and into next -- but
it’s not there yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
