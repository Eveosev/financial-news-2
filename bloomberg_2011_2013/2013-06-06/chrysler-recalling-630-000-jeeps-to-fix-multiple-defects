Chrysler Group LLC recalled about
630,000 Jeep sport-utility vehicles to fix transmission leaks
and other mechanical defects, two days after the company said it
won’t recall 2.7 million other SUVs alleged by U.S. regulators
to have faulty fuel systems.  Chrysler will recall about 254,000 Compass and Patriot SUVs
from the 2010 to 2012 model years in the U.S. to fix a software
error that can delay the firing of curtain airbags and seat-belt
pretensioners, the company said today.  The automaker separately is recalling 181,000 Wrangler SUVs
in the U.S. to fix a transmission cooler line that could leak
due to premature wear, the  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based company
said. The airbag action affects 109,400 more vehicles outside
 North America  and 45,400 in  Canada . The transmission-leak recall
covers an additional 40,100 vehicles outside the U.S.  Chrysler on June 4 said U.S. regulators proposed recalls
for Jeep Grand Cherokees from model years 1993 to 2004 and the
Jeep Liberty from model years 2002 to 2007. The  National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration  linked the vehicles to 51 deaths
from fires after rear-impact collisions.  Chrysler said the vehicles are safe and won’t be recalled.  The automaker is optimistic that consumers will read the
company’s research and agree that the vehicles in question are
safe,  Reid Bigland , Chrysler’s sales chief, told reporters at
the company’s Auburn Hills, Michigan, headquarters.  Executive’s Views  “Our vehicles are safe and if they make an informed
decision, I don’t think they’re going to have any concerns at
all,” Bigland said.  Discussions with NHTSA are continuing, he said.  “We’ve articulated our position in a tremendous amount of
detail why we consider them to be safe,” Bigland said. “And
that’s it. We’re not looking, I’m certainly not looking, to get
into a public tit-for-tat on this issue.”  Shares of Chrysler’s majority owner,  Fiat SpA (F) , declined 41
cents, or 6.5 percent, to close at 5.92 euros in Milan today.
