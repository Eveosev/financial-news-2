Crude from the Bakken shale formation
strengthened against West Texas Intermediate as refineries in
the Midwest restarted units that had been closed for
maintenance.  Bakken rose $1 a barrel to a discount of $2.75 against the
U.S. benchmark at 1:34 p.m. New York time, narrowing the
differential for a third consecutive day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  started a crude unit at its
Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery and Citgo Petroleum Corp.
brought a compressor back online after maintenance at the
Lemont, Illinois, plant.  WTIâ€™s discount to Brent narrowed by 47 cents a barrel at
2:41 p.m. When WTI advances against Brent, it decreases the
value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African
oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet weakened by 50 cents a barrel to a
premium of $9 to WTI and Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost 20 cents to
$9.20 a barrel over WTI.  Thunder Horse fell $1.40 to a premium of $6.35 a barrel.
Eugene Island weakened $1.50 to a $6.20-a-barrel premium.  Poseidon decreased $1.15 to $3.65 a barrel over WTI and
Mars Blend weakened 90 cents to $4.15. Southern Green Canyon
lost 90 cents a barrel to $2.35 over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
