LightInTheBox Holding Co. (LITB)  surged in
New York trading after the Beijing-based online retailer raised
$78.9 million in the first initial public offering in the U.S.
by a Chinese company this year.  The American depositary receipts jumped 22 percent to
$11.61 today after being priced at $9.50 each, within the
company’s target range of $8.50 to $10.50. The ADRs, each
representing two ordinary shares of LightInTheBox, soared as
much as 34 percent to $12.69 earlier.  LightInTheBox has become the second Chinese e-commerce
company to complete a U.S. IPO in 15 months, after  Vipshop
Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  raised $71.5 million in March 2012. The number of
initial offerings by Chinese companies declined to three last
year, from 13 in 2011 and 38 in 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Allegations by short sellers such as Muddy Waters LLC
against Chinese targets have deterred companies from selling
shares in the past two years.  “Valuations relative to growth looked reasonable,” Eric Brock, who helps oversee $4.2 billion as a portfolio manager at
Clough Capital Partners, said by e-mail from  Boston . “It’s a
small deal and well executed. Its different business model
reminds people of Vipshop,” he said, adding he bought the
company’s shares in the offering.  Vipshop, a web retailer for fashion goods based in
 Guangzhou , China, are trading at $29.46, more than four times
the initial price.  The IPO price valued LightInTheBox’s outstanding stock at
$465 million, or almost 2 times sales of $236 million in the 12
months through March 31.  YY, Alibaba  LightInTheBox is the first Chinese company to complete a
U.S. IPO after social network operator  YY Inc. (YY) ’s offering in
November. YY’s shares have more than doubled from its IPO level
of $10.50.  More Chinese Internet companies are expected to seek
listings in overseas markets this year, including Alibaba Group
Holding Ltd., the world’s biggest online retailer, and
Qunar.com, an online travel service owned by Baidu Inc.,
according to 86Research Ltd.  LightInTheBox sells lifestyle products manufactured by
Chinese companies to customers, mainly in Europe and North
America, through websites including lightinthebox.com and
miniinthebox.com. The company will use proceeds from the IPO for
technology infrastructure, expanding product offerings,
marketing and bond interest payments, it said.  “We leverage the supply chain in China and use the
Internet to directly connect with global consumers,” Chief
Executive Officer Alan Guo said in a telephone interview from
New York yesterday. “Traditionally  China  has been strong in
manufacturing, but there hasn’t been many companies that became
a retail company facing global consumers.”  The company, founded in 2007, narrowed its net loss to $4.2
million last year from $24.5 million in 2011, it said in a
 filing  yesterday. For the first three months this year, it
posted net income of $2.6 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
