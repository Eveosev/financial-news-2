Economists cut their estimates for
how much the  Federal Reserve  will reduce the amount of its
monthly asset purchases, a Bloomberg survey shows.  Policy makers led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will trim
their so-called quantitative easing program to $65 billion a
month at the Oct. 29-30 meeting of the  Federal Open Market
Committee , from the current level of $85 billion, according to
the median estimate in the survey of 59 economists this week. In
a similar survey before the Fed’s April 30-May 1 meeting,
economists expected the Fed to cut purchases to $50 billion in
the fourth quarter.  Debate among central bank policy makers over when and how
to dial back their unprecedented easing campaign has shaken
financial markets. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has dropped
2.8 percent since reaching a record closing high on May 21, and
the yield on 10-year Treasuries has risen to 2.08 percent from
as low as 1.63 percent last month as investors weighed the
timing of a reduction in the central bank’s stimulus.  “Even those who are advocating for tapering are thinking
that it could be a pretty small first step to see how it goes,”
said  Julia Coronado , chief economist for North America at BNP
Paribas in  New York  and a former Fed economist. “That’s one of
the few things we’ve learned” from the debate among policy
makers.  When the first move comes, officials will split their $65
billion in purchases between $30 billion a month of mortgage
bonds and $35 billion a month of Treasuries, a $10 billion
reduction in each category, according to the survey, conducted
June 4-5.  June Tapering?  Two of the 59 economists surveyed this week expect the pace
of purchases to be reduced at the FOMC meetings on June 18-19 or
July 30-31. Sixteen say tapering will begin at the Sept. 17-18
meeting, 14 see it happening Oct. 29-30 and 15 forecast the
first tapering Dec. 17-18. Twelve see tapering next year or
later.  “If jobs growth continues in the 150,000-to-200,000 per
month range, that’s probably sufficient to lower the
 unemployment rate  slightly,” said Tom Lam, chief economist at
DMG & Partners Securities in  Singapore . “Coupled with real GDP
growth recovering to 2.5 percent, that would be sufficient for
them to consider tapering modestly at the December meeting.”  Stocks, Bonds  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.1 percent to 291.28 at
11:10am in  London . The yield on the 10-year German bund fell 3.6
basis points to 1.485 percent.  Philadelphia Fed President  Charles Plosser  has called for
tapering to start as early as the central bank’s next meeting.
Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William C. Dudley
said in an interview with  Bloomberg News  last month that he
would like to wait three or four months to see “how the tug-of-war between the fiscal drag and the improving economy are going
to sort of work their way out.”  St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said May 23 in London
that more disinflation could prompt additional asset purchases
by the central bank, and Boston’s  Eric Rosengren  said the Fed
should increase purchases if the incoming data “do not reflect
improvements” in unemployment and inflation.  Jobs Report  Policy makers will have a clearer view of the employment
picture after today’s 8:30 a.m. monthly jobs report from the
Labor Department. Economists in a separate Bloomberg survey
expect the report to show that employers added 163,000 jobs in
May.  That would be little changed from the 165,000 that were
added in April. Over the course of the last year, payroll growth
has averaged 173,000 a month.  Investors worried about the central bank winding down
stimulus may be missing the underlying improvement in the
economy,  James Paulsen , the chief investment strategist at Wells
Capital Management in Minneapolis, said yesterday in an
interview on Bloomberg Television.  “When the Fed does start to end QE, it will actually build
confidence because it is another sign that the economy is
getting better,” Paulsen said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
