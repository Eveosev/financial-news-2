The ruble slumped to an almost one-year low and Russian bond yields surged to a seven-month high as
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  reignited
speculation over the tapering of global monetary stimulus.  The Russian currency declined 0.5 percent against the
dollar-euro basket to 36.8370 by 6:47 p.m. in Moscow, the
weakest level since June 25. It weakened 0.2 percent versus the
dollar to 32.2170. The yield on the government’s benchmark ruble
bonds due in 2027 increased 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage
point, to 7.62 percent, the highest since November 19, according
to data complied by Bloomberg.  Draghi said the euro-area economy will return to growth by
the end of the year, handing policy makers a reason to hold back
fresh stimulus. Emerging-market assets have retreated since
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on May 22 that the
U.S. central bank “could take a step down” in its pace of debt
purchases in the next few months if it saw sustained improvement
in the economy.  Russia ’s economy is growing at the weakest pace
since 2009, also helping to weaken the ruble.  “OFZ and ruble, along with other risk assets, fell on
Draghi’s comments,” Dmitry Dorofeev, strategist at BCS
Financial Group, said in e-mailed comments.  Brent crude  gained 0.5 percent to $103.55 per barrel, the
highest in a week. The oil and natural-gas industries contribute
about half of Russia’s budget revenue.  “I was negative on the ruble, but didn’t it expect it to
fall this hard,” Andrei Mishko, a foreign exchange trader at
MDM Bank in Moscow, said by phone today.  Russia’s economy grew 1.6 percent in the first quarter, the
weakest pace since a contraction in 2009, according to the
statistics service. The expansion may accelerate to 2.3 percent
in the second quarter, according to the median estimate of nine
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
