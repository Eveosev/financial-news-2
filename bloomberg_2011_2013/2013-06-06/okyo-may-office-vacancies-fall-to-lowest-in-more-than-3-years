Office vacancies in  Tokyo  fell for a
third straight month in May to the lowest in more than three
years amid a lack of new supply and more space being taken up as
companies expand, according to broker Miki Shoji Co.  The rate, a measurement of unoccupied space, fell to 8.3
percent last month from 8.5 percent in April, according to data
released today by the closely held Tokyo-based office-brokerage
company. The May rate was the lowest since January 2010 when it
was at 8.25 percent.  The office market in  Japan ’s capital is improving as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe strives to end 15 years of deflation and
boost the world’s third-largest economy with measures that
include reviving the property industry, which has been
struggling since an asset bubble bust two decades ago. New
supply of  office space  in Tokyo this year, which is about 40
percent of 2012’s level, will put a floor under rents, according
to broker DTZ.  “The improvement in the office vacancy rate was due to a
lack of new supply,”  Masahiro Mochizuki , an analyst at Credit
Suisse Group AG in Tokyo, said. “We may see further declines in
the vacancy rate, when the performance of corporations improves
going forward.”  Abe, in a preview of the government’s economic growth
strategy, said yesterday that he will set up strategic zones to
allow construction of more high-rise buildings. Japan has been
grappling with deflation that has caused companies and
households to put off spending since the late 1990s, after asset
prices collapsed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
