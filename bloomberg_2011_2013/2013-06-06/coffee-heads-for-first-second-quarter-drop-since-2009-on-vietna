Robusta coffee, at a 16-month low in
 London , is heading for the first second-quarter drop since 2009
as rains in leading producer Vietnam eased concerns that dry
weather will cut next season’s output. Sugar gained.  Futures traded on NYSE Liffe fell 10 percent so far this
quarter, heading for the first drop for the April to June period
in four years. In the second quarter of 2009, the beans slid 15
percent. Prices gained 6.6 percent in the first three months of
this year as drought in Vietnam threatened to cut output for the
harvest that starts there in October.  “Increased origin-selling has been weighing on the
market,” Arthur Liming, a Chicago-based futures specialist at
Citigroup Inc., said in a report e-mailed yesterday, referring
to sales by producers. “Drought conditions in the central
highlands of  Vietnam  look to be eased noticeably. This takes
away a major bullish leg that has been supporting robusta.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in July delivery fell 0.8

(2.2 pounds) yesterday, the lowest since Feb. 1, data from the
Daklak Trade & Tourism Center on Bloomberg showed.  Vietnam Harvest  The harvest in Vietnam may climb 4.9 percent to 1.5 million
tons in the 12 months starting Oct. 1 as rain last month ended a
