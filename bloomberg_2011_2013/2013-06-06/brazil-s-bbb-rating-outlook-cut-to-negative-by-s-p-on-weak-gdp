Brazil’s credit rating outlook was
cut to negative by  Standard & Poor’s , which said sluggish
economic growth and an expansionary fiscal policy could lead to
higher government debt levels.  S&P reduced the outlook on the government’s BBB rating,
which is two levels above junk and in line with Mexico and
Colombia, from stable.  The move, which threatens to end a decade-long stretch of
rating upgrades for Latin America’s biggest country, was
triggered by the outlook for “modest” economic growth,
“weaker” fiscal policy and a deterioration in the government’s
credibility, S&P said in a report. S&P forecasts the economy
will expand 2.5 percent this year after growing 0.9 percent in
2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
