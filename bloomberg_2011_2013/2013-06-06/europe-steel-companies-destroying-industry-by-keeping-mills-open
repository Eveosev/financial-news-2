European steel  companies are at risk
of destroying their own industry unless they close mills to cut
overcapacity and halt falling prices, the Eurofer lobby said.  “There is enormous danger for the whole industry,”
Wolfgang Eder, the steel group’s president, told journalists
yesterday. “The plants need to be closed. The larger groups are
destroying their businesses by keeping all the plants going.”  Steel-industry earnings have slumped as  Europe ’s economic
crisis saps demand and slower Chinese growth weighs on prices.
Steelmakers are grappling with spare capacity, while costs rise.
Europe, with the capacity to make about 200 million metric tons
of steel a year, needs to close plants capable of producing
about 40 million to 50 million tons in the next three years,
said Eder, also chief executive officer of  Voestalpine AG. (VOE)   European steel industry shares have tumbled 19 percent in
2013, the worst among 37 industry groups tracked by Bloomberg.
ArcelorMittal, the biggest steel producer, said last month that
European demand would drop to a low this year before rebounding.  Politicians and labor unions need to respect the decisions
of company owners when it comes to closing plants, Eder said.  “Interfering makes things worse,” he said.  ArcelorMittal (MT) 
faced political pressure and clashed with unions in France and
 Belgium  following plans to shutter sites in Florange and Liege.  To contact the reporter on this story:
