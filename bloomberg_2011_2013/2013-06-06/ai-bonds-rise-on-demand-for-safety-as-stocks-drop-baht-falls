Thailand ’s  government bonds  rose,
with the yield on 10-year notes falling the most in five weeks,
on speculation investors are favoring the relative safety of
fixed income as stocks dropped and  consumer confidence  dipped.  The baht declined along with the SET Index of equities,
which was poised for its lowest close in two months. Stock
Exchange of Thailand President Charamporn Jotikasthira, speaking
at a press conference in Bangkok, urged investors not to panic,
saying economic and corporate earnings growth remain strong. An
index of consumer sentiment from the University of the Thai
Chamber of Commerce fell to 72.8 in May from 73.9 in April, it
reported today.  “Risk sentiment is quite fragile now and domestic
investors are shifting to safer government bonds,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist covering  emerging markets  at Dai-ichi
Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo .  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due June 2023 declined
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.57 percent as
of 3:43 p.m. in Bangkok, adding to a three basis point drop
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. data is also raising doubts over the strength of an
economic recovery. The ADP Research Institute reported yesterday
that companies boosted employment by 135,000 workers in May,
less than the 165,000 median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Labor Department data tomorrow may show U.S. firms
added 165,000 jobs in May, the same as a month earlier.  Baht Falls  The baht dropped 0.2 percent to 30.60 per dollar and
reached 30.64 earlier, the weakest level since Jan. 2, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, rose six basis points to 6.4 percent.  The currency has lost 1.4 percent since the Bank of
Thailand cut its benchmark interest  rate  by a quarter of a
percentage point to 2.5 percent on May 29 and said it is ready
to act on monetary policy if needed. Central bank data showed on
May 31 that the nation posted a record current-account deficit
of $3.4 billion in April.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. lowered its
target for the baht to 32 per dollar from a May 23 target of
30.70, senior currency strategist Khoon Goh wrote in a research
note today, without specifying a timeframe.  The deficit in April means the currency is more sensitive
to fund outflows from the bond markets and the central bank may
cut its policy rate in the fourth quarter to 2.25 percent,
further weighing on the baht, the bank said.  Global funds sold $634 million more sovereign debt than
they bought since the end of April, Thai Bond Market Association
 data  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
