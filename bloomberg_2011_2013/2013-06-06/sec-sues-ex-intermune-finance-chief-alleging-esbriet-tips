Ex- InterMune Inc. (ITMN)  Controller Bruce
Tomlinson was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for allegedly disclosing tips in 2010 about the drug
Esbriet to a former business associate.  Tomlinson, who was vice president of finance and
InterMune’s principal accounting officer, tipped Michael
Sarkesian, a Swiss businessman, about nonpublic information on
the progress of a European Union regulatory committee’s review
of InterMune’s application to market Esbriet in  Europe , the SEC
said in a complaint filed today in federal court in San
Francisco. Esbriet is used to treat a fatal  lung disease .  Sarkesian contacted Quorne Ltd., a British Virgin Islands-based broker whose only shareholder is a Cyprus trust maintained
for the benefit of Sarkesian’s wife, to buy InterMune call
options that resulted in a profit of $616,000, the SEC said.  The value of the options soared in December 2010 on news
that the EU committee had approved the application.  The commission is seeking a court order permanently
blocking Tomlinson from violating securities laws or acting as
an officer or director of a publicly traded company and
unspecific civil penalties. Sarkesian wasn’t sued in the case.  Colleen Mahoney, an attorney for Tomlinson, didn’t
immediately return an e-mail seeking comment on the complaint.  The case is SEC v. Tomlinson, 13-02549, U.S. District Court
( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
