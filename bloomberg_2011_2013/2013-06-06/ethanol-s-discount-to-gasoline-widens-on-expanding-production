Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened a fourth day, the longest set of declines against the
motor fuel since January, a day after an Energy Department
report showed higher output rates.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 3.2 cents to 33
cents a gallon at noon New York time. An Energy Information
Administration report yesterday showed  production  last week
jumped 2.5 percent to 885,000 barrels a day, the steepest weekly
gain since April 5 and the highest level since June 15, 2012.  “It was a pretty good bump up in production,” said Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,
 Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for July delivery fell 0.8 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $2.517 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 15 percent this year.  Gasoline for July delivery rose 2.4 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $2.8470 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 89 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended May 31, the least since
Feb. 22, the Energy Department’s statistical arm said in the
report yesterday.  The biofuel is made mostly from corn in the U.S. Last
summer’s drought devastated crops and increased ethanol
production costs.  Biofuel Output  Output has rebounded 15 percent from a record low of
770,000 barrels a day in the week ended Jan. 25, EIA data show.  The U.S. Agriculture Department estimated May 10 that the
corn harvest will rise to a record 359.17 million metric tons
this year, as farmers plant the most acres since 1936.  Corn for July delivery was unchanged at $6.6075 a bushel in
Chicago. The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was 11 cents,
down from 12 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. refiners are required to use 13.8 billion gallons of
ethanol this year. Compliance with the law is tracked by
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, certificates attached
to each gallon of biofuel. Once ethanol is blended into
petroleum companies can maintain the RINs for submission to the
government or trade them.  Corn-based ethanol RINs for 2013  were up 1 cent at 95 cents
at noon  New York  time. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and
Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, were steady at $1.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
