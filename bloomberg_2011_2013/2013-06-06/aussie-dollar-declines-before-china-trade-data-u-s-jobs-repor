Australia ’s dollar dropped versus the
yen, set for its worst weekly rout since 2011, before Chinese
data tomorrow forecast to show growth in imports slowed, dimming
the demand outlook for commodities.  Implied volatility of the Aussie against the U.S. currency
was set for a sixth weekly advance, the longest in two years,
before a U.S. jobs report today that may help investors estimate
when the Federal Reserve will start reducing monetary stimulus.
Australia’s government bonds extended their gains to a third day
amid increasing bets the Reserve Bank will cut borrowing costs
to shore up economic growth.  “We’re bearish on the currency,” said Andrew Salter, a
currency strategist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ)  in Sydney, referring to the Aussie. It’s a little bit of a
surprise that “Chinese growth is so sluggish,” he said.  The Australian currency dropped 1 percent to 92.13 yen as
of 5:10 p.m. in Sydney after touching 90.84, the least since
Jan. 2. It’s slumped 4.2 percent in the five days through today,
poised for the biggest plunge since September 2011. New
Zealand’s kiwi dollar declined 0.6 percent to 77.31 yen, having
fallen 3.2 percent this week.  Australia’s dollar slid 0.8 percent to 95.17 U.S. cents,
extending its fifth weekly drop to 0.6 percent. New Zealand’s
dollar lost 0.5 percent to 79.86 U.S. cents, trimming its weekly
advance to 0.5 percent.  Australian Yields  The  yield  on Australia’s benchmark 10-year government note
dropped 9 basis points to 3.26 percent, extending its weekly
decline to 10 basis points. Similar-maturity note yields in New
Zealand fell 5 basis points to 3.55 percent.  One-month implied volatility for the Aussie against the
greenback added 73 basis points to 13.3 percent today. The
measure of expected moves used to price options gained 1.53
percentage points since May 31 and 6.3 percentage points in the
six weeks through today. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “Volatility has long been the nemesis of the carry
trade,” Ray Attrill, the global co-head of foreign-exchange
strategy in Sydney at National Bank of Australia Ltd. wrote in a
research note today. “In the absence of a retracement of at
least half of the recent spike in volatility, there is no reason
to expect interest in the Australian dollar as a carry trade
currency to revive.”  Investors who borrowed dollars to fund investments in
Australia’s currency in carry trade have lost 6.4 percent in the
past month, the worst performance after South Africa’s rand
among 16 major currencies. The Aussie may fall to 93 U.S. cents
in December, Attrill forecasts.  China , U.S.  Imports in China, Australia’s biggest overseas market,
probably increased 6.6 percent in May from a year earlier,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index (SPGSCI)  of 24
commodities has fallen 4 percent since the of March, poised for
the biggest quarterly decline in a year.  In the U.S., companies are estimated to have boosted
payrolls by 163,000 workers last month, down from 165,000 in
April, a separate poll of economists shows before the release of
the figures today.  Traders see the Reserve Bank of Australia lowering
borrowing costs by 47 basis points in the next 12 months, a
Credit Suisse Group AG  index  based on overnight-index swaps
showed. The index indicated 36 basis points of cuts on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
