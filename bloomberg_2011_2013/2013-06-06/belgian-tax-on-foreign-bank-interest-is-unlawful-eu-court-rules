Belgium violated European Union rules
by granting a  tax exemption  to savers with money only in
domestic bank accounts, the EU’s highest court said.  Belgium’s argument that the measure is needed “to prevent
 tax avoidance  and evasion in the context of guaranteeing the
effectiveness of fiscal supervision cannot be accepted,” the  EU
Court of Justice  in Luxembourg ruled today.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive agency,  sued 
Belgium in 2010, saying the tax measure could discourage Belgian
residents from going to banks established outside the country
“as the interest paid by such banks cannot benefit from a tax
exemption applicable only to interest paid by Belgian banks.”  Belgian Finance minister Koen Geens “has taken note of”
and “is examining the ruling,” said Davine Dujardin, his
spokeswoman.  The case is: C-383/10, European Commission v. Kingdom of
 Belgium .  To contact the reporter on this story:
