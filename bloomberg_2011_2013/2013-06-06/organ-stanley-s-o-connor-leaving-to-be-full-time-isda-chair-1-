Stephen O’Connor  is leaving  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  to become full-time chairman of the  International Swaps
and Derivatives Association  as the $633 trillion privately
negotiated swaps market faces regulation for the first time.  O’Connor, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1988 and held
several positions in regulatory-reform strategy, clearing and
counterparty risk management, is starting in the broadened role
effective today, New York-based ISDA said in a statement.
O’Connor has been on the group’s board since 2008 and was
elected chairman by its members in April 2011 while he stayed on
at Morgan Stanley.  The industry group is navigating rules under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that include increased collateral requirements for
swaps-market participants and a mandate that most trades be
backed by a clearinghouse.  “ISDA’s mission, leadership and activities have never been
more important in building safe, efficient markets for all users
of derivatives,” O’Connor said in the statement.  O’Connor, who set up Morgan Stanley’s counterparty
portfolio management group, was most recently focused on over-the-counter derivatives regulations, according to an internal
Morgan Stanley memo announcing the departure. Mark Lake, a
spokesman for the bank in  New York , confirmed the contents of
the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
