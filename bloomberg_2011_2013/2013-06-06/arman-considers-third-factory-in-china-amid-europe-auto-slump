Harman International Industries Inc. (HAR) ,
a maker of car infotainment systems, is considering building a
third factory in China as it seeks to more than double the
proportion of revenue from the country.  The factory, if built, will house departments for design,
manufacturing, assembly and shipping of products worldwide,
Harman Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Paliwal. A decision will
be made in six to 12 months, he said.  “If we do it here, we have to do it with scale,” Paliwal
said in an interview in Chengdu, China, where he was attending
the Fortune Global Forum. “Proper big scale. Nothing small.”  Harman, which counts Toyota Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor
Co. among its customers, is seeking growth in countries like
 China  to reduce its reliance on  Europe , where the auto market is
contracting for a sixth consecutive year to a two-decade low.  The  Stamford , Connecticut-based company is targeting to get
25 percent of its worldwide revenue from China by 2018, up from
10 percent currently, Paliwal said.  “I’m extremely bullish on China,” he said. “Next five
years for China, we’ll more than double, triple our business
here.”  Harman’s sales in China rose to $400 million last year from
less than $20 million four years ago, Paliwal said. The company
has announced $200 million in total investments in the country
so far, he said.  The company is also shifting from serving mostly  luxury
vehicles  to mid-end models to focus on expanding sectors,
Paliwal said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
