The yen declined, halting a two-day
advance, on speculation its recent gains have been excessive.  Japan ’s currency reached its strongest level since April 16
yesterday and had the biggest intraday gain since March 17,
2011, when it rallied on speculation Japan would delay
intervention to limit the currency’s advance as the nation
struggled to avert disaster at a nuclear-power plant. JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s Volatility Index, based on currency option
premiums, touched 10.38 percent, the highest since June 2012.  “Concerns around the Bank of Japan’s control of the
Japanese  money supply  are what triggered much of the turbulence
we are seeing,” Michael Schmanske, founder and chief executive
officer of New York-based Glenshaw Capital Management LLC, said
in an interview.  The yen declined 0.4 percent to 97.37 per dollar as of 7:09
a.m. in  Tokyo  from yesterday, when it rallied as much as 3.2
percent. Japan’s currency slid 0.4 percent to 128.97 per euro,
which was little changed at $1.3244.  Futures traders had increased their bets that the yen will
weaken against the dollar to the most since July 2007. The
difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and other
large speculators on a decline in Japan’s currency compared with
those on a gain, known as net shorts, was 99,769 contracts on
May 28, versus 95,186 a week earlier, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
