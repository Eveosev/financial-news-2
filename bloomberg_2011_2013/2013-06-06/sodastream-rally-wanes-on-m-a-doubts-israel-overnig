SodaStream International Ltd. (S27)  pared
gains in  New York  trading as speculation wanes that  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) 
or Coca-Cola Co. were in talks to buy the Israeli producer of
in-home soda makers.  The stock advanced 2.7 percent to $71.24 after  shares 
traded in  Germany  surged as much as 45 percent to the equivalent
of $102.86 following reports in Israeli media that the largest
U.S. beverage makers were interested in buying the company.
Partner Communications Co. rose the most on the Bloomberg
Israel-US Equity Index, which advanced 1.5 percent.  Allot
Communications Ltd. (ALLT)  fell 2.3 percent to $11.50, widening its
discount to Tel Aviv-listed shares to about 4 percent.  “These rumors are groundless,” Shea said in a telephone
interview. “It’s inconsistent with business models of both
PepsiCo and Coca-Cola -- they don’t make appliances.”  SodaStream’s head of investor relations Yonah Lloyd said
via e-mail that the company does not comment “on rumor and
speculation” when asked if it was in talks with PepsiCo and
Coca-Cola.  Soda Making  SodaStream’s soda-making system, which employs reusable
bottles, CO2 cylinders, tap water and a range of more than 160
flavor syrups, is sold in 45 countries. PepsiCo has $7 billion
of cash, giving it firepower for an acquisition.  The stock has surged 24 percent since May 13, when Chief
Executive Officer Daniel Birnbaum predicted revenue of $1
billion by 2016, compared with last year’s  sales  of $436
million. Trading volume in SodaStream shares exceeded an average
daily level by six times in New York yesterday.  Barclays Plc almost doubled its target for SodaStream to
$100 on June 3 as analyst  David Kaplan  said concerns that at-home soda making is a “fad” are overblown. The valuation
reported by the Calcalist seems “reasonable”, he wrote in a
note yesterday, adding that an acquisition by a company such as
PepsiCo would make strategic sense.  ‘Very Hard’  “If Coca-Cola or Pepsi buys SodaStream, then the
penetration of SodaStream would go through the roof overnight,”
Jim Chartier, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. in New
York, who has a buy recommendation on the stock, said by phone
yesterday. “It’s SodaStream’s gas exchange business that is
very hard to replicate. Whoever buys them, would have an access
to that technology.”  The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the 25 largest
Israeli companies traded in the U.S. advanced to 92.16,
extending this year’s gain to 6.7 percent. That compares to a
3.3 percent gain on the benchmark TA-25 Index in 2013.  Alon Blue Square Israel Ltd. gained 0.4 percent to $3.39 in
New York yesterday, widening the discount to its Tel Aviv-traded
shares to 3.7 percent.  Partner increased 4.5 percent to $6.45 in New York
yesterday, as trading volume exceeded the average daily level
for the past three months by almost four times. The Tel Aviv
shares added 1.2 percent to 23.07 shekels, or $6.37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
