Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN)  is poised to
hire four liquefied natural gas traders from  Morgan Stanley (MS)  in
London and Singapore, said two people with knowledge of the
move.  Luis Lesmes, Rajiv Panicker and Lou Montilla will join from
Morgan Stanleyâ€™s London office, while Maggie Jia will leave the
bank in Singapore, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  Officials at Glencore in Baar,  Switzerland  and Morgan
Stanley in London declined to comment. Spark Spread reported the
appointments earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
