A Thailand-based trader was sued by
U.S. regulators over  claims  he reaped more than $3 million in
profits trading ahead of the announcement that  Smithfield Foods
Inc. (SFD)  would be acquired by  China ’s biggest pork producer.  Badin Rungruangnavarat bought out-of-the-money Smithfield
call options and futures contracts last month after obtaining
nonpublic information from sources that may have included a
Facebook friend, the Securities and Exchange Commission said
yesterday in a statement announcing the lawsuit filed in federal
court in  Illinois . The SEC obtained an emergency court order to
freeze Rungruangnavarat’s assets, the agency said.  Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd. agreed on May 29 to
acquire Virginia-based Smithfield, the world’s largest hog
producer, for about $4.72 billion. Rungruangnavarat made his
purchases from May 21 through May 28 using an account at
Interactive Brokers LLC., the SEC said. He sought to withdraw
more than $3 million from his account on June 3, the SEC said.  “The speed in which we were able to bring this emergency
action exemplifies the talent, tenacity, and commitment that the
SEC staff brings to bear every day to keep our markets fair and
investors safe,” said Andrew Ceresney, co-director of the SEC’s
division of enforcement.  The SEC said there is no known defense counsel for
Rungruangnavarat at this time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
