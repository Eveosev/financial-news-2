Newark Mayor Cory Booker is
collecting signatures to run for the U.S. Senate seat left
vacant by the death of Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, according

Lautenberg’s death on June 3, will “make an official
announcement at an appropriate date,” Kevin Griffis, a
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
