The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will curb crude shipments through most of
this month as demand from Asian refiners drops during seasonal
maintenance, tanker tracker Oil Movements said.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will ship 23.7 million barrels a day in the four weeks to June
22, down 1 percent from 23.93 million in the previous period to
May 25. the researcher said in an e-mailed report. The figures
exclude two of OPEC’s 12 members, Angola and  Ecuador . The
organization kept its production target at 30 million barrels a
day at a meeting in Vienna last week.  “The current maintenance round is very deep and
prolonged” in  Asia ,  Roy Mason , the company’s founder, said
today by telephone from Halifax,  England . “West African
eastbound shipments are down, and eastbound sailings from the
Gulf are down.”  Middle Eastern shipments will slip by 1.1 percent to 17.4
million barrels a day, compared with 17.6 million in the month
to May 25, according to Oil Movements. That figure includes non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will advance 0.6 percent to 471.36
million barrels versus 468.53 million, data from Oil Movements
show. The researcher calculates the volumes by tallying tanker
bookings. Its figures exclude crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
