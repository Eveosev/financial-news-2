U.S. stock futures maintained gains
after a report showed applications for  unemployment benefits 
fell last week.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures expiring this month
added 0.3 percent to 1,613.40 at 8:34 a.m. in  New York .  Jobless claims decreased by 11,000 to 346,000 in the week
ended June 1 from a revised 357,000, the Labor Department
reported today in Washington. The median forecast of 47
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 345,000.
Continuing claims declined for the second time in three weeks.  Investors are scrutinizing labor-market data as they
consider whether the  Federal Reserve  will begin scaling back
stimulus. Data yesterday showed companies in the U.S. hired
fewer workers than projected in May. A Labor Department report
tomorrow is expected to show employers added 165,000 to non-farm
payrolls last month, equal to the total in April.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
