Philippine stocks  advanced  after an
11 percent slump from a record high drove valuations to the
lowest level since February.  The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index gained 0.5
percent to 6,588.40 at 11:21 a.m. in  Manila , after slumping as
much as 2.7 percent earlier. The gauge was  valued  at 18.3 times
projected 12-month earnings at yesterday’s close, the cheapest
since Feb. 3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
index’s 15-day  volatility  rose to 28, the highest level in a
year. SM Investments Corp. gained for the first time in six
days, while Ayala Land Inc. rallied 2.8 percent.  The nation’s shares have slumped since climbing to an all-time high on May 15 as foreign investors sold stocks on
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve would reduce the pace of
monetary stimulus. Overseas funds sold a net $147 million of
Philippine stocks in the three days through June 5, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The selloff was an “extreme
overreaction,” Philippine Stock Exchange President Hans Sicat
said in an interview with ABS-CBN News today.  “The market has reached oversold levels and valuations
have turned attractive for some investors,” Jerome Gonzalez,
who helps manage $237 million at Philequity Management Inc.,
said by phone today. “Investors are looking at technical
support between 6,300 to 6,500. We expect the market to remain
volatile and it’s hard to predict how long this consolidation
will last.”  SM Investments Corp., gained 2.1 percent, rallying from a
five-day, 15 percent slump.  Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) , the nation’s
largest property developer, climbed 1.5 percent, after CB
Richard Ellis said office vacancy rates in key Manila districts
fell to an all-time low in the first quarter and rental rates
rose by as much as 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
