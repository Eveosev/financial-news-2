Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  will offer light bulbs
that can be dimmed by a smartphone application, part of a
strategy by the biggest U.S. cable company to branch out beyond
television service.  The company will begin selling Osram Sylvania Inc.’s  Ultra
iQ LED BR30  bulb, which are controlled using a wireless
technology called ZigBee, according to a statement today. It’s
part of a collection of security and automation services Comcast
is selling under the Xfinity Home brand.  Comcast is looking for new sources of revenue as video
subscribers decline because of competition from phone companies
and Internet streaming services. The company started Xfinity
Home two years ago and sells a  package  that includes video
monitoring and a programmable thermostat for $39.95 a month.  The company said today that it will disclose the price and
availability of its light-bulb service later.  Comcast lost 60,000 video  customers  in the first quarter
for a total of 21.9 million, the 24th straight quarter it has
lost TV subscribers. Internet and phone customer additions have
helped keep sales growing at the Philadelphia-based company.  Comcast rose less than 1 percent to $40.24 at the close in
 New York . Danvers, Massachusetts-based Osram Sylvania is a unit
of Munich-based lighting company Osram, which is being spun off
from  Siemens AG. (SIE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
