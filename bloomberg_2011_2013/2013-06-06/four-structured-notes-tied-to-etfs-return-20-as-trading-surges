Trading of four similar U.S.
structured notes tied to exchange-traded funds surged as the
securities sold for more than 20 percent above face value.  The notes, all distributed by  UBS AG (UBSN) , were tied to the
value of the  SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) ,  iShares MSCI EAFE Index
Fund (EFA) , and the  iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (EEM)  and
mature on Jan. 30, 2015, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The notes traded 1.43 million times in 13 minutes starting
4:04 p.m. on May 28 in New York, the highest volume since they
were issued, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That’s more than
five times their combined volume of 261,600 trades in the
month’s preceding four weeks.  UBS, HSBC Holdings Plc,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , and  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
issued the securities on Oct. 27, 2010. They were valued between
121 and 123 cents on the dollar on May 28. The notes issued by
Deutsche Bank traded at the highest price, 123.08 cents on the
dollar.  The biggest of the four offerings was $22.1 million of
notes sold by Barclays. The securities yield as much as 64.3
percent with protection against 30 percent of losses and all
capital at risk, according to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. UBS distributed the notes
for a 3.13 percent fee.  Glenmede Holdings  Glenmede Trust Co., a Philadelphia-based investment
management company, owned 10,000 of the notes issued by Barclays
and UBS, according to a May 15  filing  registered with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Alex Dalgliesh, a
spokeswoman for the company at Braithwaite Communications,
didn’t return phone calls seeking comment.  The SPDR S&P 500 ETF rose 40 percent since the notes were
issued to $165.83 on May 28. IShares’ EAFE ETF  rose  8.9 percent
and its emerging markets fund  fell  7 percent during that same
period.  Eric Glicksman, a spokesman for UBS, didn’t return an e-mail seeking comment.  Mark Lane , a spokesman for Barclays,
Juanita Gutierrez, a spokeswoman for HSBC, and Amanda Williams,
a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, declined to comment on the
notes or the trades.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
