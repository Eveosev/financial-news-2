Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said he’s opposed to slowing bond
buying, or quantitative easing, with the inflation rate falling
below the central bank’s 2 percent target, Market News
International reported.  “I’d be reluctant to make a tapering move with inflation
trending down the way it is here,” Bullard, who votes on
monetary policy this year, told MNI in an interview. “We need
some kind of reassurance that that’s going back toward target.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
