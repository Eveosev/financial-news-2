Top seed Serena Williams overwhelmed
Italy’s Sara Errani to set up a French Open final with defending
champion  Maria Sharapova .  The American won 6-0, 6-1, in 46 minutes at Roland Garros.
Fifth-seeded Errani, who lost last year’s final in Paris, was
overpowered as Williams took her short serves and returns and
banged them into the corners.  Sharapova defeated  Victoria Azarenka  of Belarus in the
other semifinal. The Russian, the second seed, won 6-1, 2-6, 6-4
over the third-seeded Azarenka. The match was delayed 35 minutes
by rain after the second set.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
