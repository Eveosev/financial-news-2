European Central Bank President Mario Draghi comments on  interest rates , inflation, and the economy.  He made the remarks at a press conference in  Frankfurt 
today after ECB policy makers left the benchmark interest rate
at record low of 0.50 percent.  On the economic analysis:  “We decided to keep the key interest rate unchanged.
Incoming information has confirmed our assessment, which led to
the cut” of interest rates in early May. “Underlying price
pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued in the
medium term. At the same time, recent sentiment data have shown
some improvement from low levels. Against this overall
background, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative
for as long as necessary.”  On the economy:  “Recent developments in economic sentiment data have shown
some improvements. While domestic demand should be supported by
the accommodative stance of our monetary policy and generally
lower inflation. The significant improvements in financial
markets since last summer should work their way through to the
real economy. At the same time, the necessary balance sheet
adjustments in public and private sectors will continue to weigh
on economic activity. Overall, economic activity should
stabilize and recover over the course of the year.”  “The Governing Council continues to see downside risks
surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
