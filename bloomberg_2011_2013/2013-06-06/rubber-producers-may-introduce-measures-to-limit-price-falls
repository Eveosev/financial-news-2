Rubber producing countries may
introduce “appropriate” measures to counter a further fall in
prices, according to the International Rubber Consortium.  The spot contract on the benchmark  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange
has been “abnormally” lower than the free-on-board  price  in
Bangkok since March 12, Yium Tavarolit, the consortium’s chief
secretary, said by phone yesterday. The gap widened as much as
50 cents a kilogram compared with a range of 10 cents to 20
cents a kilogram previously, he added.  Futures in Tokyo have fallen 16 percent this year on
concerns over expanding stockpiles and easing demand. Thailand,
Indonesia and  Malaysia , the top three producers, haven’t made
any joint official announcement on an export restriction after a
program to cut shipments by 300,000 metric tons ended in March.  “Producing countries are monitoring a widening gap between
the Thai rubber export price and futures, which may encourage
them to introduce appropriate measures to counter a further
fall,” Yium said.  Thai prices traded between 80 baht ($2.62) to 90 baht a
kilogram since March, showing that local supply is tight as
exporters increase orders to fulfill contracts, Yium said. The
most-active contract in Tokyo traded at 253.4 yen ($2,554 a ton)
a kilogram at 9:39 a.m. in Bangkok.  Thai exporters have been buying from the Tokyo exchange to
boost prices and will continue to do so as long as they remain
lower than those in  Thailand , Pongsak Kerdvongbundit, honorary
president of the Thai Rubber Association, said on April 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
