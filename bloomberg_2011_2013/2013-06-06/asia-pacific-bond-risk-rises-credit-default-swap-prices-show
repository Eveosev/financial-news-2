The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
rose, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index climbed 5.5 basis points to
100.5 basis points as of 9:17 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The gauge, which increased last month for the first
time since September, is poised for its biggest one-day increase
since May 27 and its highest close since June 3, according to
data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan advanced 4 basis points to 127 as of
8:33 a.m. in  Singapore , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. prices show. The measure is on course for its highest close
since Nov. 16, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 3.75 basis points to
122 basis points as of 9:48 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The gauge, which has ranged from 96.1 basis
points to 127.5 basis points this year, is set for its highest
close since April 1, according to data provider CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness, while a drop suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
