Treasury 10-year note yields fell to
the lowest level in almost two weeks as investors sought the
safety of government debt before jobs data tomorrow that will
help guide the  Federal Reserve ’s path on monetary stimulus.  U.S. government securities briefly extended gains as stocks
fluctuated after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
refrained from announcing more monetary stimulus. The Labor
Department will report tomorrow that nonfarm payrolls increased
by 163,000 jobs in May, a Bloomberg survey forecast. The U.S.
said it will auction $66 billion in Treasuries next week.  “The market has built in an expectation for something less
than consensus from tomorrow’s data, but it’s still an
uncertainty,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $2.1
billion as chief investment officer at United Nations Federal
Credit Union in  New York . “The ECB today spooked investors who
were looking for more in terms of its commitment to expand
monetary policy.”  Yields on benchmark  10-year notes  decreased one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.08 percent at 5 p.m. New
York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They
touched 1.99 percent, the least since May 24, after rising
earlier to 2.13 percent. The price of the 1.75 percent
securities maturing in May 2023 advanced 3/32, or 94 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 97 2/32.  Thirty-year bond  yields were little changed at 3.25 percent
after they reached 3.17 percent earlier, also the lowest since
May 24.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE  index (SPX)  climbed to 83.6 yesterday, the highest
level since June 2012. It has averaged 62.5 in the past year.  Volume Climbs  Trading  volume  rose 30 percent to $481 billion, from $370
billion yesterday, according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt . Volume surged to $662
billion on May 22, the highest level in data going back to 2004.
The average daily volume this year is $306 billion.  Treasuries have lost 1 percent in 2013, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes, amid speculation the Fed will
slow the pace of asset purchases.  “The market is caught between the idea of the Fed possibly
paring back or the possibility of job growth not being enough,”
said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe Generale SA in New York,
one of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.  Fed Purchases  The Fed is buying $85 billion of government and mortgage-backed securities each month to support the economy by putting
downward pressure on borrowing costs. It purchased $3.68 billion
in Treasuries today maturing between March 2019 and May 2020.  Fed policy makers next meet June 18-19.  U.S. stocks slid after jobless claims dropped and the ECB
kept its benchmark  interest rate  at 0.5 percent without
announcing further measures to spur the 17-nation euro area’s
economy. Draghi said the region’s growth should stabilize at a
subdued pace. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7 percent
before erasing losses and ending the day 0.9 percent higher.  The U.S. announced it will sell $32 billion in three-year
notes, $21 billion in 10-year debt and $13 billion in 30-year
bonds next week in daily auctions that begin June 11.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross , manager of
the world’s biggest mutual fund, said it’s good for the firm to
be in  U.S. Treasuries  and high-quality bonds amid rising risks
in the global markets. Stocks, high-yield debt, currencies and
emerging-market bonds are all in “disarray,” Gross said during
an interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers.”  In a posting June 4 on Twitter,  Newport Beach , California-based Gross said “30 years of bond bull markets have raised
returns and spirits. Now there are doubts. We’re sticking with
bonds as long as Fed does.”  Employment Data  Initial  claims  for jobless benefits in the U.S. decreased
by 11,000 to 346,000 in the week ended June 1 from a revised
357,000, Labor Department data showed. The median forecast of 47
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 345,000.  The payrolls report tomorrow is forecast to show the
increase in employment in the U.S. almost matched April’s
stronger-than-projected gain and that the  unemployment rate 
remained at a four-year low of 7.5 percent.  “People are apprehensive about tomorrow’s number,” said
 Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt,
reached the least since July 26. It shrank to as little as 2.08
percentage points.  The TIPS spread expanded to 2.73 percentage points on Sept.
17, the widest since May 2006. It has averaged 2.21 percentage
points over the past decade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
