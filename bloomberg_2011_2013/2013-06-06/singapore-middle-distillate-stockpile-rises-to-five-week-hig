Middle-distillate stockpiles rose to
the highest level in five weeks in  Singapore ,  Asia â€™s largest
oil-trading and storage center, according to a unit of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and kerosene gained
635,000 barrels, or 6.7 percent, to 10.2 million, in the seven
days ended yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Residual-fuel inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen rose by 1.3 million barrels,
or 6 percent, to 22.3 million, according to the data. Supplies
rose for a second week.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate climbed 338,000 barrels, or 3.4 percent, to 10.2
million, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
