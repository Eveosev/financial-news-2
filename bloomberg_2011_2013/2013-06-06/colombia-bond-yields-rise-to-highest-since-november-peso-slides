Colombia’s bond yields rose to the
highest since November as mounting speculation that the  Federal
Reserve  will taper stimulus and faster-than-forecast inflation
in the Andean country squelched demand for the securities.  The yield on benchmark peso bonds due 2024 rose 11 basis
points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 6.13 percent at 10:34 a.m.
in Bogota, the highest since Nov. 22. The price fell 1.13
centavos to 130.560 centavos per peso. Yields have jumped 1.01
percentage point in the past month.  Bonds and currencies have tumbled around the world on
speculation a pickup in the  U.S. economy  will prompt the Fed to
scale back its asset-purchase program. Ten-year U.S. Treasury
 yields  have jumped 32 basis points in the past month to 2.10
percent. Colombia’s consumer prices rose 2 percent in the 12
months through May, the government said yesterday, above the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey for a 1.96 percent
increase.  “The big driver is speculation over Fed stimulus which is
leading to this global sell off,” said  Camilo Perez , head
analyst at  Banco de Bogota SA (BOGOTA) , the nation’s second-biggest bank.
“Inflation is providing an additional argument to sell the
bonds. It’s hard to find buyers in the market, everyone is
selling.”  Colombia’s peso dropped 0.5 percent to 1,908.59 per  U.S.
dollar , the weakest since January 2012. The currency has plunged
7.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
