Veolia Environnement (VIE) , the largest
water utility in Europe, won contracts to build a distribution
network and supply water to about 200,000 people in the south
India state of Karnataka, including the Indian Institute of
Science in Bangalore.  No terms were disclosed for the deals in Ilkal and Bijapur
as well as the Bangalore campus that will generate about 8.5
million euros ($11.2 million) in revenue over the multiyear
contracts. “The goal is to provide residents and students with
quality supply 24/7 as compared with the few hours of access
they currently have each week,” Veolia said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
