Hog futures climbed to a 23-month
high on speculation that U.S. consumers are switching to pork as
a cheaper alternative to beef. Cattle were little changed.  Wholesale beef  is up 5.3 percent this year after touching
$2.1137 a pound on May 23, the highest on record going back to
January 2004, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. While
prices dropped to $2.044 yesterday, beef still is twice the cost
of  pork  at 95.22 cents a pound, USDA data show. Even whole
chickens are more expensive, with  broilers  at  Georgia  docks up
7.4 percent this year at $1.0525 a pound.  “We have to recognize that pork is maybe the best buy out
there,” Chad Henderson, a market analyst with Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc., said in a telephone interview
from Brookfield,  Wisconsin .  Hog futures for July settlement climbed 1.8 percent to
96.25 cents a pound at 10:43 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, heading for the biggest gain since May 22. Earlier,
the price touched 96.4 cents, the highest since July 7, 2011.
Prices rose 10 percent this year through yesterday.  Cattle futures for August delivery were little changed, up
less than 0.1 percent at $1.19325 a pound on the CME. Prices are
down 9.8 percent this year through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.2
percent to $1.4425 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
