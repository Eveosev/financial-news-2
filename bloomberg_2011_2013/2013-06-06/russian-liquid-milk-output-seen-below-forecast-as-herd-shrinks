Russian liquid-milk production this
year will be smaller than projected because the dairy herd is
shrinking after feed-grain prices jumped, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said.  Output will come to 31.6 million metric tons, below the
previous forecast of 32.35 million tons, the USDA’s Foreign
Agricultural Service  said  in a report. It cited “continued
reductions in Russian cow inventories as a result of unrelenting
difficulties in acquiring affordable feeds.”  Feed-grain prices climbed to records in  Russia  this season
after drought reduced the 2012 crop by a quarter. The dairy herd
will contract further this year, the FAS said. The country had
8.9 million cows by the end of April, down 1.8 percent from a
year earlier, according to government statistics.  The smaller herd and lower milk production will spur
imports, mainly from neighboring Belarus, the report showed. The
FAS raised its projection for Russian milk imports this year by
about 10 percent to 330,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
