Axa SA (CS) , Europe’s second-largest
insurer, signed a partnership with Commerzbank AG to help
finance lending to mid-sized companies in Germany,  Austria  and
 Switzerland .  “The cooperation includes newly originated credit,” the
companies said in an e-mailed statement today. The deal will
allow Axa to invest into Commerzbank’s syndicated loans and
other “selected” corporate lending in the three European
countries, they said.  Axa, based in Paris, said in the statement that it’s
seeking to expand investments in mid-sized corporate loans
outside its home market. The insurer last year teamed up with
French banks  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  to
provide loans to companies.  Commerzbank, based in Frankfurt, is Germany’s second-largest bank by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
