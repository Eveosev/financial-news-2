The wider of Czech foreign  trade
surplus  and higher exports in April may indicate the beginning
of an economic revival from a record-long  recession , said Tomas
Holub, the head of the central bank’s monetary and statistics
department.  The Czech Republic’s foreign trade  surplus  was 33 billion
koruna ($1.7 billion) in April, a 13 billion-koruna increase
from a year ago, the Prague-based Statistics Office said today.
Exports rose 6.4 percent, after falling 7.3 percent in March,
according to the statement.  The data were a “relatively positive surprise,” and
export growth was “pleasing,” Holub told lawmakers at a budget
committee hearing today. “This means there is some hope that
foreign trade may be rebounding from the bottom and help a
gradual revival of economic activity in the coming course of the
year.”  The $217 billion  economy  shrank for six straight quarters
through March, the longest decline since records began in 1996,
as  Europe ’s debt crisis curbed demand for exports and eroded
spending by households and businesses.  The slump has tamed inflation and pushed the central bank
to cut rates to effectively  zero , sparking a debate among policy
makers about whether to weaken the koruna with interventions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
