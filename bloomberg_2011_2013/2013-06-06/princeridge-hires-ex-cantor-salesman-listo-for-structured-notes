PrinceRidge Holdings LLC hired
Christopher Listo, who left Cantor Fitzgerald LP in April, as a
managing director selling structured notes.  Listo started at the firm last month, Armand Pastine, a
PrinceRidge managing director in Boca Raton,  Florida , said in a
telephone interview. Listo, who will also report to Joseph Castelluccio, a managing director in New York, declined to
comment when reached at his work phone.  Listo joined Cantor Fitzgerald in April 2010 after working
for Nomura Holdings Inc. from June 2006 to October 2009,
according to online records of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Sheryl Lee, a spokeswoman for Cantor Fitzgerald in New
York, didnâ€™t return a phone call seeking comment.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
