Global markets will face increased
volatility as central banks bring  interest rates  back to normal
levels,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon 
said.  “We should all hope for a normalization of interest rates
-- that’s a good thing,” Dimon said today during a panel
discussion at the Fortune Global Forum in Chengdu, China. “As
we go back to normal, it's going to be scary, and it's going to
be kind of volatile.”  Investors have been encouraged to buy riskier assets as
global central banks unleashed unprecedented monetary stimulus
after the financial crisis of 2008. Concern that the policies
would be reviewed grew last month following comments from
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke .  Price swings across assets and around the world are holding
below historical averages. Levels of investor concern in
equities, commodities, bonds and currencies, as measured by Bank
of America Corp.’s Market Risk  index  of cross-asset volatility,
are below readings from about 75 percent of days since 2000,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Daily fluctuations have widened in the past month amid
speculation the Fed might consider curtailing its quantitative
easing program of stimulus and reports on Chinese and American
manufacturing trailed estimates.  “I am going to be looking at every word the Fed says,”
Dimon said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
