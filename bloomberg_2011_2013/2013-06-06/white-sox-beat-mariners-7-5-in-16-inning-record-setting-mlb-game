The Chicago White Sox blew a five-run
lead in the 14th inning before breaking an eight-game losing
streak in their record-setting 7-5 victory against the  Seattle 
Mariners in 16 innings.  The teams were scoreless through 13 innings before the
White Sox scored five runs in the top of the 14th inning.  Kyle Seager then hit a tying grand slam in the bottom of
the inning for the Mariners to become the first player to
accomplish the feat in extra innings, according to Elias Sports
Bureau. The Mariners (26-34) became the first team to score five
or more runs in the 14th inning or later to tie a game.  The game also made Major League Baseball history when each
team scored five or more runs in the game after going scoreless
through the first nine, according to the major league record
keeper.  Alejandro De Aza and Alex Rios had run-scoring singles in
the 16th inning to give the White Sox (25-32) the victory in
five hours, 42 minutes yesterday at Safeco Field in Seattle.  The White Sox went through seven pitchers before Addison
Reed (2-0) gave up five runs on five hits, including the grand
slam, in three innings. Reed, who struck out five, still got the
win.  Hector Noesi (0-1), the Marinersâ€™ seventh pitcher, allowed
three runs on seven hits in three innings for the loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
