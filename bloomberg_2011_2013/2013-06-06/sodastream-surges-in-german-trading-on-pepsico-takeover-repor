SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA)  surged
to the highest price since 2011 in  New York  trading after
Israeli media reported that  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  and Coca-Cola Co. are
considering bids for the home soda-machine maker.  PepsiCo denied the report on business website Calcalist
that it’s in talks to buy SodaStream for more than $2 billion.
Coca-Cola declined to comment on a report from newspaper Globes
that it may bid for the Airport City, Israel-based company.  SodaStream Chief Development and Communications Officer
Yonah Lloyd said in an e-mail that the company doesn’t comment
on rumor and speculation.  SodaStream is growing rapidly at a time when the $183
billion global market for carbonated beverages is slowing. The
company is seeking to more than double sales to $1 billion by
2016. Researcher Euromonitor International estimates that annual
growth in carbonated beverages will weaken to 2 percent through
2017 from 4 percent in the past four years.  The  stock  rose 2.7 percent to $71.24 at the close in New
York, the highest since August 2011. It earlier surged as much
as 45 percent in Germany to 78 euros, the equivalent of $102.86,
before Jim Wilkinson, a PepsiCo executive vice president, said
today in an interview that the speculation is “completely
untrue.”  Kent Landers , a Coca-Cola spokesman in Atlanta, said the
company doesn’t comment on rumors and speculation.  SodaStream Partnership  “While we think Coke and Pepsi are more aware of
SodaStream than they were two or three years ago, we think some
sort of partnership would be much more likely than an outright
acquisition,” John Faucher, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
in New York, wrote today in a report. “We don’t see much in a
way of distribution leverage by combining, which is what we
believe you need to justify a deal.”  Chief Executive Officer Daniel Birnbaum said at a May 13
shareholder meeting he would “bet my last dollar” that PepsiCo
and Coca-Cola will seek to enter the home soda market.  “I don’t know if they’re going to do their own syrup or
they’re going to do it with us or try to get their own machine
or something, but they can’t ignore that home soda is happening,
and right now they’re not playing,” he said.  SodaStream’s $1 billion revenue target compares with last
year’s  sales  of $436 million. That implies a compound annual
growth rate of about 23 percent, according to analysts at
Oppenheimer & Co.  First Mover  SodaStream is the “Kleenex of home soda and that’s a very
strong first-mover advantage that we intend to leverage,” the
CEO said at last month’s meeting.  SodaStream’s soda-making system, which employs reusable
bottles, CO2 cylinders, tap water and a range of more than 160
flavor syrups, is sold in 45 countries. The  company  gets about
45 percent of sales from western  Europe , with the Americas
region accounting for about 39 percent.  PepsiCo has $7 billion of cash, giving it firepower for an
acquisition.  Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ) , the cookie and candy
maker split off from  Kraft Foods Group Inc. (KRFT)  last year, has been
touted as a potential target by analysts after  Nelson Peltz ’s
Trian Fund Management LP disclosed stakes in both companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
