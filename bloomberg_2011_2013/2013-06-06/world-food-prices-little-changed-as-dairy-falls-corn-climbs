World food prices  were little changed
in May as rising corn prices due to tightening export supplies
compensated for a drop in the cost of dairy, the  United Nations ’
Food & Agriculture Organization reported.  An index of 55 food items tracked by the FAO fell to 215.2
points last month from a revised 215.8 points in April, the
Rome-based FAO wrote in an online  report  today. The measure,
which climbed to a record 237.9 points in February 2011, is up
5.1 percent from a year earlier.  “The small decline in May was the result of falling dairy
and sugar prices, which more than offset an increase in
cereals,” the FAO wrote. “Supplies of  milk products  for trade
are still constrained by weather-related factors affecting milk
production in most of the major exporting countries.”  The FAO dairy price index fell for the first time in 10
months, after rising in April to the highest since December 2007
on shrinking milk supply. Milk collection in  New Zealand , the
world’s biggest dairy exporter, probably fell 1 percent to 1.5
percent in the 2012-13 season through to the end of May because
of drought, according to Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd.  The FAO’s measure of world dairy prices fell 3.5 percent to
249.8 points after jumping 15 percent to 258.8 points in April
and rising 11 percent to 225.3 points in March. The drop was led
by skimmed milk powder and butter, while average prices of
cheddar cheese rose “slightly,” the report showed.  The UN agency’s index of world grain prices rose 1.9
percent to 238.9 points in May. Export prices for corn in the
U.S. Gulf Coast region as  reported  by the International Grains
Council advanced 3.4 percent last month.  “Last month’s increase was mostly associated with a strong
rebound in maize prices, mostly a reaction to tightening export
supplies and planting delays in the U.S.,” the FAO said, using
another name for corn. “By contrast, wheat and rice quotations
were largely unchanged.”  An index of sugar prices fell 1 percent to 250.1 points,
while the FAO’s gage of the cost of cooking oils was unchanged
at 199 points. The UN agency’s measure of global meat prices was
also little changed at 179.3 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
