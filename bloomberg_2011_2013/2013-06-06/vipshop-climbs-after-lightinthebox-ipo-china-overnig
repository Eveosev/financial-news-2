Chinese equities rose the most in a
week in New York as online retailer Vipshop Holdings Ltd.
rebounded from a seven-week low after e-commerce operator
 LightInTheBox Holding Co. (LITB)  surged in its first day of trading.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. climbed 1 percent to 89.87 yesterday.
Vipshop gained for the first time in four days and  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) 
jumped the most in two weeks.  Ctrip.com International Ltd. (CTRP) 
surged to the highest level since 2011 while web game operator

after pricing shares at a discount in a secondary offering.  LightInTheBox soared as much as 34 percent in New York
after raising $78.9 million in its initial public offering. The
Beijing-based online retailer has become the second Chinese e-commerce company to complete a U.S. IPO in 15 months. Shares of
 Vipshop (VIPS) , a Guangzhou-based online fashion retailer, have more
than quadrupled since its U.S. listing in March 2012.  “LightInTheBox benefited from the great performance of
Vipshop,” Josef Schuster, the founder of IPOX Schuster LLC, an
investment firm based in Chicago with about $2.5 billion under
management, said by phone. “Companies in the Internet retailing
space are going to be well received for the time being.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., rallied 0.6 percent in New
York to $35.92, after dropping the previous two days. The
Standard and Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.8 percent to 1,622.56 as
investors weighed the  Federal Reserve ’s stimulus plans before a
U.S. report on employment growth today.  Going Private  Vipshop’s ADRs advanced 3 percent to $29.46 after a three-day decline sent them to the lowest level since April 18.

after climbing to as high as $12.69. It sold 8.3 million ADRs in
the initial offering before the underwriters purchase additional

valued LightInTheBox’s outstanding stock at $465 million, or
almost 2 times its revenue of $236 million in the 12 months
through March 31.  ADRs of  ISoftStone Holdings Ltd. (ISS) , an information technology
company based in Beijing, surged 8.3 percent to $5.24. The
company received a $5.85-per-ADR buyout offer from Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Tianwen Liu and China AMC Capital

2011.  Giant’s Discount  Giant, based in Shanghai, said yesterday a holding company
owned by Chairman Yuzhu Shi has agreed to sell 11 million ADRs
of Giant for $7.25 each in a secondary offering. The price
