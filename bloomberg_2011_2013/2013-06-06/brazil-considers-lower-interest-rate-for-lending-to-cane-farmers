Brazil  is considering reducing the
interest rate of its Prorenova  credit line  for sugar-cane
farmers to a fixed rate of 5.5 percent to lower financing costs
for mills and spur investment.  The central bank’s National Monetary Council will vote next
week on whether to cut it from a variable rate of about 8.3
percent now, said Carlos Eduardo Cavalcanti, head of biofuels at
the state development bank BNDES, which manages the Prorenova
credit line.  Many companies are waiting for the rate to go down before
requesting funds, Cavalcanti told reporters today in Sao Paulo.
Demand for loans this year may exceed the line’s 4 billion-real
($1.9 billion) budget, he said.  About 35 percent of the line’s budget was disbursed last
year, he said. The credit line is designed to help sugar-cane
companies replant crops and develop new plantations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
