Investors shouldn’t turn positive on
U.S. Treasuries following recent gains sparked by weaker-than-expected economic data, according to Luca Jellinek at  Credit
Agricole  Corporate & Investment Bank.  Treasuries rose yesterday by the most in almost two months
after a report showed U.S. private employers added fewer jobs
than forecast in May. The rally marked a reversal from last
week, when 10-year yields climbed to a 14-month high as
investors weighed whether the  U.S. economy  is strong enough to
lead the  Federal Reserve  to curtail its bond purchases.  “It is difficult to get too bullish on rates markets on
the back of a tidy correction in yields,” Jellinek, who is
based in London and is the head of European interest-rate
strategy, wrote in a note to clients today. “Fixed-income
investors are likely to remain obsessed with the Fed ‘taper.’”  The U.S. 10-year  yield  was little changed at 2.09 percent
today at 1:24 p.m. Tokyo time, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices.  The yield fell six basis points yesterday, the biggest
decline since April 12. It was 2.23 percent on May 29, the
highest since April 2012.  Companies in the U.S. added 135,000 workers in May, figures
from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP showed yesterday. The
median forecast of 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for an increase of 165,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
