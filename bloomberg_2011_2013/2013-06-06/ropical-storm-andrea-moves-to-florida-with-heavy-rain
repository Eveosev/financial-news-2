Tropical Storm Andrea, the first of
the 2013  Atlantic hurricane season , churned toward Florida with
heavy rain and the potential for tornadoes.  The system was 35 miles (56 kilometers) north-northwest of
Cedar Key as of 5 p.m. East Coast time, with top winds of 65
miles per hour, the  National Hurricane Center  said. It was
moving northeast at 17 mph and was expected to reach the coast
at the Big Bend area south of Tallahassee “shortly.”  The center’s tracking map shows Andrea crossing Florida
between Tallahassee and Jacksonville, then moving over land west
of Savannah, Georgia; Charleston,  South Carolina ; and Norfolk,
Virginia, before entering the Atlantic tomorrow on a path toward
Nova Scotia over the weekend.  Andrea is expected to retain tropical-storm-strength winds
for at least the next three days.  Tropical-storm warnings  are posted for much of Florida’s
western coast and for the eastern U.S. from northern Florida to
Delaware. Tornado watches are in effect for much of the southern
part of the peninsula.  High tides, storm surge and 3 to 6 inches (8 to 16
centimeters) of rain may bring flooding to Florida and Georgia,
the center said. As much as 10 inches of rain may fall in some
areas.  Two to 4 inches of rain are possible from Washington to the
 New York  City area and to Boston tomorrow and into the weekend,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  The New York City area, including northeastern New Jersey
and southern Connecticut, is under a flash flood watch from
tomorrow through the next day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
