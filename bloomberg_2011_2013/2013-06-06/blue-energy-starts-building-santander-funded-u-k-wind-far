Blue Energy Co., a closely held
renewable-power developer, started building a wind farm in
southeast  England  funded by equity from the company and Spain’s
 Banco Santander SA. (SAN)   Santander and Blue Energy made the investment in the 20.7-megawatt project on the Essex Coast through a joint venture that
will eventually see the bank investing as much as 100 million
pounds ($155 million) in Blue Energy projects, Madrid-based
Santander said today in an e-mailed statement. It declined to
provide any additional financial details.  Blue Energy in February bought RidgeWind Ltd. and its
portfolio of U.K. wind farms for 250 million pounds from
HgCapital LLP. It’s continuing to look for other companies to
acquire, according to the statement, and is targeting more
consented wind farm sites to add to its pipeline.  The project will comprise nine turbines supplied by  Siemens
AG (SIE)  that will also operate the facility when it starts working in
early 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
