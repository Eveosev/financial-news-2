South African corn futures declined
as the rand halted a two-day slide, lowering the cost of
importing the grain.  Yellow corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
fell 2.2 percent to 2,242 rand ($224) a metric ton on the South
African Futures Exchange by the midday close in Johannesburg.
The white variety lost 1.7 percent to 2,267.20 rand a ton.  The rand gained after South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus said the central bank has little room for an
interest-rate cut. Rising inflationary risks limit the bank’s
scope to lower borrowing costs further to stimulate growth in
 Africa ’s biggest economy, Marcus said today.  “Because the rand strengthened during our trading period,
the prices went down a bit,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at
Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone today.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of the
grain, and meal made from the white variety is a staple food
while yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July fell 0.3 percent, to close at
3,610 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
