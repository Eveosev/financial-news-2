Wells Fargo & Co., (WFC)  the largest U.S.
mortgage lender, will pay $39 million to promote home ownership
and community development to address claims that it neglected
bank-owned homes in minority communities.  The bank, in an agreement announced today with the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, will parcel out the
aid to 45 communities across the country and attempt to sell
vacant properties to buyers who plan to live in them.  “Wells Fargo’s investment demonstrates an ongoing
commitment to stabilizing African-American and Hispanic
neighborhoods in a way that advances equal housing
opportunities,” HUD General Deputy Assistant Secretary Bryan Greene said in a statement.  HUD opened an investigation last year after the National
Fair Housing Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy organization, said
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo violated the Fair Housing Act by
allowing homes it owns in minority neighborhoods to remain in
disrepair.  The NFHA said it reviewed 218 properties in eight cities,
finding that those in white neighborhoods were better maintained
and marketed than similar buildings in areas with large black
and Hispanic populations.  “We appreciate the perspectives and collaboration of NFHA
and HUD in helping us shape these initiatives, which are
consistent with our long-standing commitment to home ownership,
fair and responsible servicing, and investing in the communities
we serve,” JK Huey, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage senior vice
president, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
