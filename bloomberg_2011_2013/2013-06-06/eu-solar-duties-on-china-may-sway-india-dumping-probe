The European Union’s decision to
impose provisional duties on Chinese solar panels this week may
affect  India ’s anti-dumping investigation into solar cells,
Mercom Capital Group LLC said.  “This will certainly influence other pending disputes,”
Raj Prabhu, chief executive officer of the Austin, Texas-based
clean-energy consultancy, said in an e-mailed response to
questions.  India is considering imposing retroactive tariffs on
imports of U.S., Chinese, Taiwanese and Malaysian solar cells
after local manufacturers alleged they were being sold below
cost. It began an investigation into the dumping claims in
November.  “A trade dispute will cause the cost of photovoltaic
systems to go up,” Prabhu said. “In India’s situation, that
means bids will have to increase and the government will pay
more for solar power, which is the exact opposite of what they
are trying to do.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
