The pound rose the most since October
2009 against the dollar as the  Bank of England  refrained from
adding to stimulus that debase the currency at Governor Mervyn King’s final meeting amid signs growth is accelerating.  The U.K. currency advanced versus all except two of its 16
major peers as a Halifax report showed  house prices  rose for a
fourth month in May. Gilts fell as European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said the ECB kept further measures,
including negative deposit rates, on the shelf at this month’s
meeting. The pound is still the worst performer among Group of
Seven countries since King became central-bank governor in July
2003, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  “I probably will tweak my sterling forecasts just to make
them a bit stronger by the end of the year on the back of the
data that we’ve seen,” said Jane Foley, senior currency
strategist at Rabobank International in  London . “Everybody
anticipated that it would be a fairly non-event meeting today”
from the Bank of England.  The pound climbed 1.5 percent to $1.5642 at 5:29 p.m.
London time after rising as much as 1.8 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Oct. 15, 2009. It rose to $1.5684, the
highest since Feb. 13. The U.K. currency was little changed at
84.88 pence per euro after appreciating to 84.77 pence, the
strongest since May 21.  The Bank of England kept its  target  for bond purchases at
375 billion pounds, a decision predicted by all except one of 43
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The Monetary Policy Committee
also held the U.K.’s main  interest rate  at 0.5 percent. King’s
successor  Mark Carney  takes over on July 1.  ‘Sterling Supported’  “This could keep sterling supported for the time being,”
 Valentin Marinov , head of European Group of 10 currency strategy
at Citigroup Inc. in London, wrote in a note to clients before
the decision.  U.K.  home values  rose 0.4 percent in May from the previous
month to an average 166,898 pounds, the highest since August
2010, Halifax, the mortgage unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc,
said in a statement.  Sterling has gained 4.5 percent in the past three months,
the best performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, on fading speculation
the central bank would undertake more stimulus. The dollar fell
0.1 percent and the euro strengthened 2.6 percent.  ECB Decision  The pound pared gains versus the euro after the ECB kept
its main  interest rate  at 0.5 percent and Draghi said the euro-area economy will return to growth by year-end, reducing the
need for fresh stimulus.  “Euro-area economic activity should stabilize and recover
in the course of the year albeit at a subdued pace,” Draghi
told reporters in  Frankfurt  after the ECB’s announcement.  The 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to close at 2.02 percent. It reached 2.06
percent on June 3, the highest level since March 8. The 1.75
percent bond due in September 2022 fell 0.13, or 1.30 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 97.695.  The U.K. currency has weakened 24 percent in the 10 years
since King became BOE governor, the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes show, as policy makers cut the benchmark
interest rate to a record-low 0.5 percent from as high as 5.75
percent in 2007.  Gilts have posted the worst performance among G-7 nations
over the past month, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. The
securities lost 2.4 percent since May 6, outperforming only
 South Africa  among the 26 sovereign-debt markets tracked by the
indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
