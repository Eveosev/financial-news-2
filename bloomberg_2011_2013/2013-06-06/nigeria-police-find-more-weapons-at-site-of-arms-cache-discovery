Nigerian police seized more weapons,
including pistols and grenade caps, at a home where they earlier
said an arms cache was stashed for attacks on Israelis and
westerners in the country.  Security forces searching the house in the northern city of
Kano found a cooler buried under a wardrobe containing five
pistols, ammunition, 36 grenade caps, fuses, two explosive
devices and other weapons, Kano Joint Task Force spokesman
Ikedichi Iweha said in a statement yesterday.  A search of the home last month uncovered a cache of
weapons including anti-aircraft missiles and rocket-propelled
grenades. Three Lebanese nationals were arrested in connection
with the find and Bassey Etang, Kano state director of the
Department of Security Services, told reporters that Hezbollah
brought the weapons to  Nigeria .  “We continue to count on the support and cooperation of
the good people of Kano in the effective discharge of our
duties,” Iweha said in the statement.  Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil producer and most populous
country, is fighting an insurgency by Boko Haram Islamists who
want sharia rule. Lebanon’s Hezbollah is a Shiite militant
group, classified as terrorist by the U.S. and  Israel . It’s
backed by  Iran  and has fought with President Bashar al-Assad’s
forces against rebels in  Syria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
