Trican Well Service Ltd. (TCW) ,  Canada ’s
third-largest drilling-services provider by market value, rose
to the highest in more than a year after the company said
activity will improve in the second half.  Trican climbed 5.2 percent to C$15.96 at the close in
Toronto, the highest since March 20, 2012. The Calgary-based
company has  gained  22 percent this year.  Trican expects a “strong” third quarter and activity for
the full year will improve compared with 2012, the company said
in a presentation to investors posted on its website today.
Revenue at its Russian operations will increase from 15 percent
and 20 percent this year, Trican said.  “It’s always positive to hear them reiterate targets,”
said Michael Mazar, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in Calgary
who rates the stock a buy, said in an interview. “They should
have a strong third quarter and that helps.”  Precision Drilling Corp. (PD)  and Ensign Energy Services Inc.
are the largest drilling-service providers to the oil and
natural gas industry in Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
