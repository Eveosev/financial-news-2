Japanese  shares  declined, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average falling below 13,000 for the first time
in two months, as utilities and exporters slumped. A gauge of
small-cap stocks fell the most since after the 2011 earthquake.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , owner of the stricken Fukushima 
Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, fell for a second day to lead utilities
lower. Sharp Corp., which gets 60 percent of its sales outside
of Japan, dropped 5 percent on a stronger yen.  Komatsu (6301)  Ltd. slid
3.9 percent as machinery stocks declined. The Tokyo Stock
Exchange Mothers Index of smaller companies tumbled 13 percent
for its biggest drop since March 14, 2011.  The  Topix index  sank 1.8 percent to 1,070.77 at the close
of trading in  Tokyo , after earlier rising as much as 0.8
percent. About 15 shares fell for each that gained. The Nikkei
225 lost 0.9 percent to 12,904.02, its lowest since April 5.  “Risk money is fleeing,” said Seiichiro Iwamoto, who
helps oversee the equivalent of $33 billion at Mizuho Asset
Management Co. “With concern that monetary easing will be pared
back in the U.S., the yen is being bought and exporters sold.
Panic is causing investors to dump shares in small-caps as they
continue to fall from their high.”  Foreign investors undertook the biggest net sales of
Japanese shares since March last week, according to Ministry of
Finance data released today.  Only 121 of the Topix’s 1,709 companies rose. All 33
industry groups fell, led by machinery companies and utilities.
Car and consumer-electronics makers were the biggest drags.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3
percent today after the gauge dropped 1.4 percent in  New York 
yesterday as jobs and factory data missed estimates and
investors speculated when the  Federal Reserve  will taper bond
purchases. The yen touched 98.86 against the dollar today, the
strongest since May 9, before later weakening.  Tokyo Electric Power has slumped 23 percent over two days,
its biggest such drop since June 2011. Power producers fell
yesterday after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe failed to mention any
plan to restart reactors taken off-line after the 2011 nuclear
meltdown.  Even after the decline, Tepco, as the utility is also
known, is still up 131 percent this year and is the best-performing stock in the Nikkei 225.  Sharp, Japan’s third-largest maker of televisions, slumped
5 percent to 401 yen, while rival Sony Corp. lost 2 percent to
1,869 yen. Toyota Motor Corp. slid 1.6 percent to 5,640 yen.
Machinery maker Komatsu, which gets 30 percent of its revenue
from the Americas, lost 3.9 percent to 2,415 yen.  ‘Big Issue’  “The big issue affecting stocks is concern about scaling
back monetary easing in the U.S., which is leading to risk-off
sentiment and a stronger yen,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief
strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which
manages the equivalent of $59.6 billion.  The Topix and Nikkei 225 have rallied about 24 percent this
year to make Japan the world’s best-performing major market on
optimism unprecedented monetary easing from the  Bank of Japan 
will overcome deflation. Stocks entered a correction on May 30
after the biggest rally in a quarter century. The Topix has
fallen 16 percent from its high on May 22.  The TSE Mothers Index has dropped 28 percent from its peak
on May 14. The Jasdaq Stock Index of start-up ventures slid 5.3
percent today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange Second Section
Price Index of smaller shares fell 3.8 percent to its lowest
since April 4.  Stock prices are swinging the most in more than two years,
with a measure of 30-day  historic volatility  on the Topix
jumping to 36.15 today, the highest since immediately after the
March 2011 earthquake and nuclear accident.  Japan ’s broadest
equity measure has swung an average of about 3.8 percent daily
since May 23, when it had the biggest one-day plunge since the
disaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
