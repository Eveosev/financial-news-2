Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  will meet with representatives of the local units of
Toyota Motor Corp.,  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Ford Motor Co. to
discuss how the government can assist the car industry.  Ford announced May 23 it would end production in  Australia 
after nine decades, with the loss of 1,200 jobs, threatening the
viability of the industry in a blow to Gillard. Her Labor party
trails in polls ahead of a Sept. 14 ballot.  The meeting will aim to identify “key pressures that the
industry is facing at present and discussing what the public
policy settings should and may not be, and ensure that the
government assists the industry to meet those pressures,”
Industry and Climate Change Minister  Greg Combet , who will
attend, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio today.  The government supports the car industry through a A$5.4
billion ($5.2 billion) fund. Australia’s three car makers have
struggled as an 18 percent rise in the local dollar against the
yen over the past year stoked sales of cheaper imported vehicles
and cut exports.  “We are one of only 13 countries in the world that can
build a car from the drawing board up,” Combet said. “So it is
very important engineering capacity that we have got in
Australia. That is something that is very important for the
economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
