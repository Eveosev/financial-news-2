Sun and less rain this month has
allowed farmers in  Russia â€™s Siberian federal district to speed
up planting.  Planting was about 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres)
behind a year earlier as of June 5, compared with about 2
million hectares behind on May 31, Tamara Maksimenkova, deputy
head of the industrial plants laboratory at the state
Hydrometeorological Center, said by phone from Moscow today. In
May, cold and wet weather kept workers from planting, she said.  The Siberian federal district accounted for about 13
percent of the national grain crop in 2012, according to
government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
