U.S.  mortgage rates  rose for a fifth
week, sending borrowing costs for a 30-year loan to the highest
level in 14 months.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage jumped to
3.91 percent in the week ended today, from 3.81 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-year rate rose to 3.03 percent from 2.98 percent.  Mortgage rates have been following government  bond yields 
higher as a strengthening economy stokes speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will reduce efforts to push down borrowing
costs. The increase may spur homebuyers to accelerate deals to
lock in low rates, said  Keith Gumbinger , vice president of
HSH.com, a mortgage-information website.  “It pushes the time frame,” said Gumbinger, based in
Riverdale, New Jersey. “You may have a near-term increase so
deals can get done. But it’s not as though people who have not
come into the process are necessarily going to be energized to
look at a home.”  Rising rates have restrained  refinancings . Applications for
loans from homeowners seeking to reduce monthly payments dropped
15 percent last week to the lowest level since November 2011,
according to an index from the  Mortgage Bankers Association .  The 15-year rate topped 3 percent for the first time since
May of last year. It hit a record 2.56 percent last month. The
record low for a 30-year loan is 3.31 percent, reached in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
