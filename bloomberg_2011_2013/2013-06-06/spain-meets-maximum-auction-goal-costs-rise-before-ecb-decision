Spain  met its maximum target at a
bond auction as borrowing costs on longer maturity debt rose.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 4.02 billion euros ($5.28
billion) of debt, in line with the top target of 4 billion
euros. Its two-year benchmark notes were sold to yield 1.903
percent, down from 2.275 percent on March 21, and its three-year
benchmarks 2.706 percent, up from 2.442 percent on May 23. The
yield was 4.517 percent for a 10-year bond maturing in October
2023, up from 4.452 percent the first time the security was sold
via banks on May 14.  The sale preceded a meeting of the  European Central Bank 
today to decide on  interest rates . ECB President  Mario Draghi 
has said the Frankfurt-based central bank will act to counter
the euro region’s recession if necessary. Economists forecast
the ECB will maintain its benchmark rate at a record-low 0.5
percent, according to all except two of 59 economists surveyed
by  Bloomberg News. (EURR002W)   Demand for Spain’s 2015 notes was 2.96 times the amount
sold, down from 4.01 at the last auction, while the bid-to-cover
ratio was 2.39 for the 2016 securities, up from 2.24. The ratio
was 2.52 for the 2023 securities.  ’More Attractive’  “There are still buyers for the European periphery despite
uncertainties in the global environment,”  Peter Chatwell , a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in  London , said in a telephone interview. “If
anything, uncertainties about the timing of the Fed’s next move
make it more attractive than core countries as it offers higher
yields and suffers less from the increase in volatility.”  Spain’s sovereign borrowing costs have dropped since Draghi
said in July he would do whatever it takes to safeguard the euro
and followed that with a pledge to buy government bonds of
countries that ask for assistance.  The yield on its  10-year debt  rose two basis points to 4.46
percent at 11:45 a.m. in  Madrid , compared with a euro-era high
of 7.75 percent in July. The spread with similar German
securities widened to 2.96 percentage points.  The ECB will update its economic forecasts as European
Union leaders back off austerity-first policies to prevent the
euro area’s recession extending to the region’s core.  The EU’s statistics office Eurostat yesterday confirmed
 gross domestic product  in the 17-nation bloc fell 0.2 percent in
the first three months of the year, its sixth straight quarter
of decline. Separate data showed retail sales in the region fell
in April and services contracted last month.  Spain’s Treasury has covered 57 percent of its planned mid-and long-term gross funding needs for 2013, the  Economy Ministry 
said on May 23. It is due to return to the markets on June 18 to
sell six- and 12-month bills before a bond auction on June 20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
