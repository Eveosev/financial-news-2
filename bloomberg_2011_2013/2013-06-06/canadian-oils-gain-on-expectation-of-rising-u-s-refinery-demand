Canadian crudes strengthened on the
 spot market  on the expectation of more demand as Midwest
refineries return from maintenance and increase output for the
North American summer driving season.  Exxon Mobil (XOM) ’s Joliet,  Illinois , refinery is expected to
restart this month after maintenance that began in mid-April.  BP
Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting, Indiana, plant is said to be planning to finish
converting a crude unit to process heavy crude this month as
well. The Joliet plant can process 238,000 barrels a day and
Whiting 420,000.  Western Canada Select heavy oil for July delivery gained
$1.65 to a discount of $14.50 a barrel against U.S. benchmark
West Texas Intermediate oil, according to Calgary oil broker Net
Energy Inc. It’s the narrowest discount since April 15,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Syncrude, a light crude from oil-sands bitumen processed in
an upgrader, gained $2.65 to a $4.25 premium, Net Energy said.
It was the highest premium since .  U.S. refinery utilization  rates  increased by 2 percentage
points to 88.4 percent last week, according to a report
yesterday by the Energy Information Administration. Refinery
fuel production typically increases at the start of the U.S.
summer driving season on Memorial Day, which fell on May 27 this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
