International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
won a key part of a protest over the Central Intelligence
Agency’s cloud-computing contract with  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)   The U.S. Government Accountability Office, which arbitrates
federal contract disputes, today sustained Armonk, New York-based IBM’s challenge of the four-year award, which has a
maximum value of $600 million.  The GAO recommended that the CIA reopen negotiations with
the companies and amend the solicitation “if necessary,” said
Ralph White, the office’s managing associate general counsel for
procurement law.  The intelligence agency failed to properly evaluate prices
and waived one contract requirement only for Amazon, according
to the GAO.  The GAO denied IBM’s assertion that the CIA failed to
properly evaluate Amazon’s past performance, including service
outages that occurred in 2012.  IBM filed the protest Feb. 26. The full decision wasn’t
publicly released.  “We now anticipate the reopening of the contract proposal
process,” said Clint Roswell, an IBM spokesman.  Officials with the CIA and Amazon didn’t immediately
respond to calls and e-mails seeking comment about today’s
decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
