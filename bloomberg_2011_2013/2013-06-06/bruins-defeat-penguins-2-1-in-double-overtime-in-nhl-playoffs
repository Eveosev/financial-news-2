The  Boston Bruins  scored with the
94th shot of the longest game of the National Hockey League
postseason to move within one win of the Stanley Cup finals.  Patrice Bergeron scored with four minutes, 41 seconds left
in the second overtime to give the Bruins a 2-1 victory over the
Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference finals.  David Krejci  put the Bruins ahead in the first period last
night at TD Garden in Boston and  Chris Kunitz  tied the game
midway through the second period.  The Bruins lead the best-of-seven series three games to
none and can advance to the championship series with a home win
on June 7.  In the Western Conference finals, the top-seeded Chicago
Blackhawks lead the defending Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles
Kings two games to one going into tonight’s Game 4 in Los
Angeles.  Chicago defenseman Duncan Keith will sit out tonight’s game
after being handed a one-game suspension for high-sticking  Jeff Carter  in the second period of the Kings’ 3-1 victory in Game 3.
Carter sustained a 20-stitch gash on his face and suffered three
cracked teeth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
