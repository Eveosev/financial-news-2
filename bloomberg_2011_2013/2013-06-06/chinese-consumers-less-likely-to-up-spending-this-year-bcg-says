Consumers in  China  said they are less
likely to increase spending this year as the economic
environment becomes more uncertain, according to a Boston
Consulting Group survey.  In particular, the middle-income and affluent consumers in
smaller Chinese cities beyond Shanghai and Beijing are more
inclined to hold back on additional purchases, preferring
instead to save for future family spending or car and property
purchases, said Boston Consulting, which polled a thousand
consumers in 12 cities on the mainland in April.  China’s economy  unexpectedly slowed in the first quarter of
the year, as manufacturing and fixed-asset investment missed
forecasts on slowing global and domestic demand. China retail
sales in the first four months of this year expanded 12.5
percent from a year ago, slowing from a 14.7 percent increase
during the same period in 2012, according to data from the
Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics.  Chinese president Xi Jinping’s crackdown on extravagant
spending by government officials is also having a “notable
effect” in the smaller cities, where both groups and
individuals have held back spending, the study showed.  Buyers in China are now moving away from simply buying
branded labels and more focused on quality and bargains than
before, it said.  The  International Monetary Fund  last month lowered its
forecasts for China’s growth this year to 7.75 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
