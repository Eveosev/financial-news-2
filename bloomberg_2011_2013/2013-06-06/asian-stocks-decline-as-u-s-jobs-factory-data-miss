Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index heading to a six-month low, after U.S. jobs and
factory data missed estimates and investors speculated whether
the  Federal Reserve  will scale back bond purchases.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a maker of power tools that gets
73 percent of its sales in  North America , dropped 2.3 percent in
Hong Kong.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  tumbled 7.4 percent, leading
utilities lower. Newcrest Mining Ltd., the worst performer of
Australia’s 20 largest companies this year, fell 6.9 percent
after Credit Suisse Group AG cut its rating amid concern it will
lower output and halt expansion.  Rinnai Corp. (5947) , a maker of gas
appliances, slumped 7.9 percent in Tokyo on a share-sale plan.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 1.1 percent to 130.87 as
of 8 p.m. in Tokyo. More than four shares fell for each that
rose on the gauge, which is heading for the lowest close since
Jan. 8. The measure is down 9.3 percent from this year’s high on
May 20 amid concern the Federal Reserve may scale back stimulus
and as Japanese stock indexes entered a correction last week.  “The Fed is putting out a feeler in the market with a
stimulus-exit debate,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a Tokyo-based
senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which
oversees the equivalent of $70 billion. “The market gets sold
after mediocre economic reports, while being bought on good
ones. It’s repeating that zigzag pattern.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 2.3 percent this year
through yesterday. The measure yesterday traded at 12.9 times
average estimated earnings, compared with 14.6 for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index and 13 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Deflation Fight  A gauge of consumer discretionary companies in the Asia-Pacific index led gains this year as Japanese shares rallied on
the back of a weaker yen and the promise of policies to end
deflation. Energy companies had the biggest declines amid
concern that  China ’s demand for fuel will drop as economic
growth slows.  Japan’s  Topix index  slid 1.8 percent, reversing an earlier
gain of 0.8 percent, after plunging 3.2 percent yesterday. The
Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers Index of smaller firms tumbled 13
percent, its biggest drop since March 14, 2011.  The Topix is down 16 percent from a May 22 five-year high,
cuttings its 2013 advance to 25 percent. Japan’s broadest equity
measure has swung an average of about 3.8 percent daily since
May 23, when it had the biggest one-day plunge since the
disaster.  Regional Gauges  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 1.1 percent and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was little changed. Taiwan’s  Taiex Index 
retreated 1.1 percent and Singapore’s Straits Times Index
dropped 1.5 percent. South Korea’s market was closed for a
public holiday.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 1.1 percent and the Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies slid 1.1
percent, capping the longest losing streak in a year. China’s
Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.3 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  rose 0.4 percent today after
the gauge dropped 1.4 percent in New York yesterday, when a
report from ADP Research Institute showed companies in the U.S.
hired fewer workers than projected in May amid federal budget
cuts and higher taxes. Separate data from the Commerce
Department showed factory orders in April fell short of
estimates.  Beige Book  The Fed’s  Beige Book  showed the  U.S. economy  expanded at a
“modest to moderate” pace in 11 of 12 central-bank districts,
with broad-based gains ranging from business services to
construction and manufacturing. The survey is based on data
collected by Fed regional banks on or before May 24.  Exporters to the U.S. dropped. Techtronic slid 2.3 percent
to HK$19.42 and  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , a Japanese automaker that
gets 29 percent of its sales in North America, dropped 4.4
percent to 349 yen in Tokyo.  Utilities fell, led by Japanese power companies. Tokyo
Electric Power, the owner of the stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant, tumbled 7.4 percent to 475 yen. Even after
dropping 23 percent in the last two days, the company is still
the best performing stock in the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  this
year.  Kyushu Electric Power Co. (9508)  declined 6.5 percent to 1,218 yen
and  Hokuriku Electric Power Co. (9505)  retreated 5 percent to 1,285
yen.  Newcrest Mining, Australia’s biggest gold producer, slid
6.9 percent to A$13.36, the lowest since June 2005. Citigroup
Inc. and UBS AG have also downgraded the miner to sell, citing
concerns over costs and expected production cuts.  Rinnai Corp. slumped 7.9 percent to 7,150 yen in Tokyo as
it plans to raise as much as 22.5 billion yen ($227 million) in
a share sale for  capital spending , according to a filing with
Japan’s Ministry of Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
