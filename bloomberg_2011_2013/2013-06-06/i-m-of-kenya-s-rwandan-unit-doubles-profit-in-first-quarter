Banque Commerciale du Rwanda Ltd., a
unit of  Kenya ’s I&M Bank Ltd., almost doubled profit in the
first quarter as customer numbers grew and the company contained
costs, Managing Director Sanjeev Anand said.  Net income grew to 1.2 billion Rwandan francs ($2 million)
in the three months through March from 698.4 million francs a
year earlier, Anand said in an interview today in Kigali, the
capital. The company is targeting annual income of 4.8 billion
francs in the year through December from 4.2 billion francs last
year, he said.  Net interest income, the money banks earn from interest
charges on loans, rose 10 percent to 2.2 billion francs in the
quarter, Anand said. Expenses increased 7 percent in the period,
he said, while the number of customers grew 20 percent to
30,000. The lender aims to have 100,000 account holders by the
end of the year, Anand said.  Banque Commerciale is 55 percent owned by I&M of Kenya,
which last month merged with City Trust to form a lender
estimated to be worth 29 billion shillings ($341 million). The
Rwandan government, which owns 19.8 percent of Banque
Commerciale, plans to sell its stake this year, Capital Market
Authority Chief Executive Officer Robert Mathue said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
