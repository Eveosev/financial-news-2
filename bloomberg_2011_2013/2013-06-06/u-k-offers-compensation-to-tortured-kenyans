U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague
offered 19.9 million pounds ($31 million) in compensation to
Kenyans who were tortured by British forces during the Mau Mau
uprising in  Kenya  in the 1950s.  “The British government sincerely regrets that these
abuses took place and they marred Kenya’s progress towards
independence,” Hague told lawmakers in Parliament in London
today. “Torture and ill-treatment are abhorrent violations of
human dignity which we unreservedly condemn.”  There are 5,228 claimants, Hague said, after a legal battle
between a number of elderly victims and the British government,
which the British Foreign Office had contested on the grounds
the time for legal claims had expired.  Hague said the government continues “to deny liability for
British taxpayers today,” though it does not dispute that
claimants were mistreated under colonial rule. The uprising was
designed to throw out the British. Kenya became independent in
1963.  To contact the reporters on this story:
