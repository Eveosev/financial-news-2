The  International Monetary Fund , the
 European Central Bank  and the European Commission are “working
well” together supervising  Greece ’s second bailout and have
made adjustments based on their experience in the country, a
fund spokesman said.  “We would all agree that some things could have been done
differently,” Gerry Rice told reporters in Washington today, a
day after an internal report assessing the fund’s role in the
first Greek rescue package found “notable failures.”  “With our European partners we have learned and we have
adapted,” Rice said. The IMF-European group, known as troika
“has worked well” and “is working well,” Rice said.  The European Commission, the European Union’s Brussels-based executive branch, today rebutted parts of the IMF staff
report, saying a restructuring of Greek debt in 2010 would have
wreaked havoc in markets.  Asked about progress on reaching agreement for a $4.8
billion loan to  Egypt , Rice said there was “good progress” in
the technical discussions with the authorities.  “We are receiving data and information all the time from
the Egyptian authorities, there’s good progress on that front,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
