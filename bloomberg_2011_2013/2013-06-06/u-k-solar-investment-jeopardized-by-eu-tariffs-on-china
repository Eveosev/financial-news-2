Minister Greg Barker said investment in solar power may be
jeopardized by European Union tariffs on panels from  China 
and that Britain is pushing for a “sensible” agreement.  The EU on June 5 imposed tariffs of 11.8 percent on panels
from China for allegedly selling them in the 27-nation bloc at
below cost, a practice known as dumping. The tariff will rise to
as high as 67.9 percent after two months, with the lower rate
set as an incentive for China to negotiate.  “We are determined to continue to press the European
Commission to come to a sensible agreement with China,” Barker
said in Parliament today. “We are very concerned by the impact
of EU tariffs on the U.K. solar industry. In the last three
years we’ve added 2.5 gigawatts here in the U.K., but that could
really be jeopardized if these tariffs go ahead.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
