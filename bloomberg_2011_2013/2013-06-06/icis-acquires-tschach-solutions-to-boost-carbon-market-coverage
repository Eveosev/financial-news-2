ICIS, an energy information unit of
 Reed Elsevier Plc (REL) , is buying carbon market analysis firm Tschach
Solutions GmbH for an undisclosed sum.  Tschach, based in Karlsruhe,  Germany , was founded in 2010
and provides research and price forecasts in the European Union
carbon market and United Nations Clean Development Mechanism
emissions-credit program, ICIS said in a statement today.  Managing directors Ingo Tschach and Jan Frommeyer will
remain with ICIS, said Jacqueline Savory, senior marketing
manager at ICIS in London. “The product offering remains
unchanged at this stage,” she said by phone, declining to
comment on the transaction’s terms.  Trading in EU carbon permits rose 5.9 percent to a record
2.1 billion metric tons in the three months through March,
compared with the last quarter of 2012, according to the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in  London . Prices in the EU’s
greenhouse-gas market, the world’s largest by traded volume,
have slumped 41 percent in the past year amid a surplus of
allowances that regulators are struggling to fix.  Frommeyer declined to comment when reached by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
