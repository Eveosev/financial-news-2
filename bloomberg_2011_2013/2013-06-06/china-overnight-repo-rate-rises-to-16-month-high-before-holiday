China ’s overnight money-market rate
climbed to a 16-month high on speculation cash supply will
tighten as banks hoard funds to meet customer withdrawals before
a three-day holiday next week.  The People’s Bank of China  injected  a net 160 billion  yuan 
($26 billion) of capital into the financial system this week,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The monetary authority sold 10
billion yuan of 28-day  repurchase agreements  at a yield of 2.75
percent today, according to a statement posted on its website.
China’s markets will be shut from June 10 to June 12 for the
Dragon Boat Festival, which marks the death of ancient scholar
Qu Yuan.  “Liquidity is very tight before the holidays,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co.,
the nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “Banks are busy borrowing
money.”  The one-day  repurchase rate,  which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed 116 basis points, or 1.16
percentage points, to 5.89 percent as of 10:44 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It touched 6.18 percent, the highest since Jan. 19,
2012.  The central bank issued 11 billion yuan of 91-day bills
today at a yield of 2.9089 percent, unchanged for an eighth
sale, according to a statement on the PBOC’s website.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate,
climbed six basis points to 3.50 percent, the highest since Nov.
3, 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
