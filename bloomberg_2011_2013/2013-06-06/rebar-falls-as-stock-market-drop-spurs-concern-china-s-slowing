Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell as a six-day decline in the stock market fueled
wider concern that growth in China is slowing.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 1.7 percent to 3,422  yuan  ($558) a
metric ton, before trading at 3,428 at 10:40 a.m. Futures fell
14 percent this year.  China’s  stock market  extended declines today and is poised
for the longest losing streak in a year. The official Purchasing
Managers’ Index for smaller companies slid to 47.3 in May from
47.6 in April, even as the  broader gauge  rose.  “The equity market performance and the outlook on the
economy is negative for bulk commodities now,” Jiang Yuying, an
analyst at Chengdu Brilliant Futures Co., said by phone from
Shanghai today. “Since it’s the last two trading days before
the long holiday next week, we might see prices fluctuate as
investors trim their positions.”  China ’s financial markets will be shut from June 10 to June
12 for public holidays.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at
Tianjin port in China was unchanged at $116.60 a dry ton
yesterday, pausing after gains in the previous two sessions,
according to the Steel Index Ltd. The steelmaking ingredient
fell to $110.40 a dry ton on May 31, the lowest since October.  The  average spot price  for rebar was little changed at
3,444 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
