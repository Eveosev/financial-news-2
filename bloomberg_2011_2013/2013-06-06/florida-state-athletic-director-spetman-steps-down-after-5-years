Florida State University Athletic
Director  Randy Spetman , who was hired in 2008, stepped down
under a mutual agreement with the school.  He was replaced on an interim basis by  Vanessa Fuchs , the
athletic department’s senior women’s administrator while the
school searches for a replacement, the university said in a
statement.  Spetman, 60, was hired in February 2008 when the athletic
department was working through an academic scandal and turmoil
surrounding the pending retirement of football coach Bobby
Bowden. He will serve in an advisory role within the athletic
department until his contract ends in February of 2014.  “Randy established an enviable record for Florida State
Athletics and has done so with the highest level of integrity
and commitment,” University President Eric Barron said in a
statement.  Barron last week told the  Tallahassee Democrat  that Spetman
wasn’t strategic in his thought process and planning, but
credited him for keeping the department in compliance with
National Collegiate Athletic Association rules.  Fuchs is a former FSU women’s basketball player, who was
promoted to senior associate athletic director/senior women’s
administrator last July. She was a four-year letter winner and
co-captain her senior season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
