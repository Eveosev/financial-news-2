Ukrainian opposition parties blocked
parliament, demanding that President  Viktor Yanukovych  deliver
his annual address to lawmakers in person.  Written copies of Yanukovych’s 572-page speech were handed
out today and the text was published on the presidential
website.  “Instead of Yanukovych’s report to parliament, we’ve just
received a document,” Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who heads jailed
opposition leader  Yulia Tymoshenko ’s party, said in the capital,
Kiev. “It shows a lack of respect. He should come to parliament
and address the nation and lawmakers.”  Ex-Prime Minister Tymoshenko’s party, world boxing champion
Vitali Klitschko’s UDAR and the right-wing Svoboda have blocked
parliament on several occasions following October elections in
which Yanukovych retained control of the legislature. Opposition
politicians have challenged ballot results in some districts and
called for a mayoral vote in Kiev.  As well as demanding Yanukovych appear for his annual
address, Klitschko criticized a proposal by the president’s
Party of Regions to hold repeat elections in five districts on
Aug. 18.  “The authorities want to hold re-elections when the
majority of people are on holiday,” he said. “That would be
done to falsify the results.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
