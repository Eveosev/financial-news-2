China  is losing top-notch talent at
the highest rate in the world as students who seek degrees
abroad opt to remain overseas, the official People’s Daily
newspaper reported today.  An average of 87 percent of students in science and
engineering stay overseas, the newspaper said, citing an
official from a government working group on talent whom it
didn’t identify. China needs to compete better for human talent,
the report cited the official as saying.  Young Chinese have flocked to overseas schools in search of
degrees. The country’s policy of limiting many couples to one
child and its growing wealth mean middle-class families can
afford U.S. tuition that far exceeds the costs of Chinese
universities.  Chinese citizens now account for the largest proportion of
foreign students at U.S. universities, the  Institute of
International Education  said in a November report. Chinese
enrollments at U.S. universities in the 2011-2012 academic year
increased by 23 percent, it said.  The country lacks high-level innovative and entrepreneurial
talent, the People’s Daily cited the official as saying.
Investment is not sufficient and institutional obstacles have
not been eliminated, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
