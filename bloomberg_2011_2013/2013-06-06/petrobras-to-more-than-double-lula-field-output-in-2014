Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3) , the world’s
biggest producer in deep waters, plans to more than double
output at  Brazil ’s second-biggest discovery next year after
installing another production vessel.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
started pumping crude at the Cidade de Paraty unit today and
will gradually increase output to 120,000 barrels a day in the
second half of 2014, the company said in a statement. Output at
the vessel will average 13,000 barrels a day this month and
increase as it connects more wells, Petrobras said.  State-controlled Petrobras is counting on Lula and other
fields in the so-called pre-salt region in deep waters of the
Atlantic Ocean to double output by 2020. Lula is Brazil’s
second-biggest discovery after Libra, an oil field Brazil plans
to auction in October that holds as much as 12 billion barrels
of recoverable crude. Petrobras will operate Libra with a
minimum 30 percent stake.  Output at Lula has surpassed Petrobras’s initial forecasts,
with individual wells pumping more than 30,000 barrels of oil
and natural gas a day. In April Petrobras pumped 115,000 barrels
of oil and gas a day at Lula, making it Brazil’s sixth-biggest
producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
