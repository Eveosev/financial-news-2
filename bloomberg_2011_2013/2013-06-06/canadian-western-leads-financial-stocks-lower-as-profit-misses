Canadian Western Bank (CWB)  fell the most
in three months after posting second-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates on higher expenses and tighter lending
margins.  Canadian Western fell 3.3 percent to C$27.60 at 1:50 p.m.
in Toronto, making it the  worst performer  today in the Standard
& Poor’s/TSX Financials Index. The shares have slid 2.8 percent
this year, compared with the 1.4 percent advance of the 45-company index.  Net income for the period ended April 30 climbed 8.4
percent to C$43 million ($41.9 million), or 54 cents a share,
from C$39.7 million, or 52 cents, a year earlier, the Edmonton-based bank said today in a statement. Adjusted earnings, which
exclude some items, were 55 cents a share, missing the 57-cent
 average estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The lower-than-expected earnings were driven by expenses
and margins,” Andre-Philippe Hardy, an analyst at  RBC Capital
Markets , said in a note to clients.  Canadian Western, led by Chief Executive Officer
Christopher Fowler, has expanded its wealth-management business
to diversify beyond commercial and wholesale lending. In April,
the bank agreed to buy a 55 percent stake in Calgary-based
McLean & Partners Wealth Management Ltd., which oversees about
C$1 billion of assets.  The lender, which operates mostly in  Canada ’s western
provinces, has posted a profit in 100 consecutive quarters. The
bank raised its quarterly  dividend  one cent to 18 cents a share,
according to the statement.  Margins Squeezed  Net interest margin, the difference between what a bank
pays for deposits and charges for loans, declined 16 basis
points to 2.65 percent from a year earlier, according to the
statement. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Low  interest rates  and “ongoing competitive pressure” have
squeezed margins, the bank said.  “This key measure will remain under pressure until we see
some movement toward higher interest rates,” Fowler said in the
statement.  Expenses rose 8.8 percent to C$64.8 million from a year
earlier, led by an 11 percent increase in salaries and benefits,
according to the statement. Revenue increased 7.1 percent to
C$136 million.  (Canadian Western will host a conference call at 3 p.m.
