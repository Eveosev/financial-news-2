Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  is ahead of
schedule on its plan to double the assortment of goods available
on its website as the world’s largest retailer works to blunt
competition from online rivals.  The assortment may be doubled by the end of the second
quarter, earlier than its previous target of reaching the
milestone by the end of the year, Joel Anderson, chief executive
officer of Walmart.com in the U.S., said today in Bentonville,
 Arkansas , as the company prepares for its annual meeting
tomorrow.  Wal-Mart is trying to boost sales in the U.S. as rivals
such as  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and the dollar stores lure its
customers. Online sales at U.S. retailers grew more than 17
percent between 2011 and 2012, more than four times faster than
overall retail sales, according to research and consulting firm
Kantar Retail.  Wal-Mart rose 0.5 percent to $75.61 at 3:36 p.m. in  New
York . The shares had gained 10 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with a 13 percent increase for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
