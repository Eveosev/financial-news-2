NYSE Euronext said the opening
auction for all regulated markets has been delayed as it faces
technical issues.  The issues prevented all members from entering orders in
equities, bonds and exchange-traded funds, the exchange operator
said in a market-status update on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
