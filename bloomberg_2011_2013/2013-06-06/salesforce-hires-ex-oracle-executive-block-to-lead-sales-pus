Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , the largest
maker of customer-management software, named former Oracle Corp.
sales executive Keith Block as president and vice chairman.  Block, who spent 26 years at Oracle, will lead Salesforce’s
customer-facing operations, the San Francisco-based company said
in a statement today.  Salesforce has been expanding into applications for online
marketing and human resources, and hiring veterans of the
enterprise-software industry to help fuel growth. Chief
Executive Officer Marc Benioff hired former Oracle and  SAP AG (SAP) 
engineering executive John Wookey in 2011. This week, Salesforce
agreed to acquire  ExactTarget Inc. (ET)  for $2.5 billion to extend a
push into online-marketing tools.  “His exceptional track record leading sales, consulting
and engineering teams makes him a powerful addition to our
world-class distribution and leadership team,” Benioff said of
Block in the statement.  Block, who left Oracle last year, used text messages to a
human-resources executive at the software maker to make
disparaging comments about Oracle co-president  Mark Hurd , and
about products acquired from Sun Microsystems in 2010. The
messages, posted to the website  Scribd  by technology blog
 AllThingsD , emerged as part of a lawsuit between Oracle and
 Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , where Hurd was once CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
