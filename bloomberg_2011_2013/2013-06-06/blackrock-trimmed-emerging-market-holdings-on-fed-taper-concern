BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
money manager, said it reduced emerging-market positions, citing
concern a reduction in bond buying, or quantitative easing, by
the Federal Reserve may curb support for the assets.  “We had very little exposure to local emerging-market
bonds but have trimmed our external emerging-market positions
recently to reduce the levels of risk from this sector,” Scott Thiel, deputy chief investment officer of fundamental fixed-income in London, said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Sustained accommodative U.S. monetary policy has
benefited these markets and the potential reduction in QE could
reduce that liquidity and source of support,” Thiel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
