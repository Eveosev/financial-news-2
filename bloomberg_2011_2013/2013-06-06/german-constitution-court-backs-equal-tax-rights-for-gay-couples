Germany ’s highest court ruled that
excluding same-sex couples from a tax benefit available for
married partners is unconstitutional and said the government
must retroactively change the 12-year-old legislation.  The tax law dating from 2001 must be amended as it violates
the constitution’s equality rules, the Karlsruhe-based court
said today in a  statement  on its website. Same-sex “civil
unions” must be eligible for the tax benefits immediately until
new legislation is in place, it said.  “Today’s decision is another forceful step and the
breakthrough for equal treatment of the civil union and
marriage,” Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger
said in an e-mailed statement. “Now legislators must act. Civil
unions must no longer be discriminated against in any way.’  Members of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic
Union-led bloc have spoken out against granting gay couples
equal tax rights. While Germany legalized same-sex partnerships
as civil unions in 2001, it doesn’t allow  same-sex marriages .  To contact the reporter on this story:
