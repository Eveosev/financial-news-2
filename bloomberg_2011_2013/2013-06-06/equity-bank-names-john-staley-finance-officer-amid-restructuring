 Equity Bank Ltd.,  Kenya ’s biggest
lender, has restructured its operations and promoted John Staley
to chief officer in charge of finance, innovation and
technology, the Nairobi-based company said in a statement.  Staley, who is currently the director of mobile banking and
payment innovations, will replace chief finance officer Samson Oduor, who left the bank in March.  Equity’s board of directors also promoted Joseph Iha to
Managing Director of its unit in  Tanzania .  Staley, who becomes the fifth head of finance at Equity
since 2010, will be supported by finance executives Fredrick

bank as he knows its operations, having joined the bank in
2003,” said Francis Mwangi, head of research at Nairobi-based
