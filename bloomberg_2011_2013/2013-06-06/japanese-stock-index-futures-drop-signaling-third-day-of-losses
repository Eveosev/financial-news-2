Japanese equity futures fell,
signaling a third day of losses for the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average, on concern the yen’s biggest increase in two years
against the dollar will hurt corporate profits.  Futures on  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring this
month closed at 12,700 in  Chicago  yesterday, 1.9 percent lower
than 12,820 at the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the
pre-market at 12,680 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. The yen
strengthened 2 percent to 97.07 per dollar yesterday, touching a
seven-week high.  European stocks slid and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
briefly fell below 1,600 as European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi said growth should stabilize and more stimulus
measures will be left “on the shelf.” Japan’s currency rose as
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe failed to provide additional detail on
stimulus measures. Abe said a legislative campaign to loosen
rules on businesses won’t begin for months as he outlined his
“third arrow” of an economic revival plan that seeks to build
on fiscal and monetary stimulus.  “The Bank of Japan and Prime Minister Abe have really set
forth a plan to create growth,” said Jason Brady, a fund
manager who helps oversee about $89 billion at Thornburg
Investment Management Inc. in Santa Fe, New Mexico. “They’re
continuing to flesh out that plan, but the trouble is that
prices have changed a lot for both the Nikkei and the yen. We’ve
priced in that they’re trying, and now it’s question of whether
it’s going to work or not. That’s a bigger hurdle.”  Toyota, Honda  American Depositary Receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest carmaker, slid 1.2 percent from the close in
 Tokyo . ADRs of Honda Motor Co. lost 1.5 percent. Those of Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd., Asia’s biggest international carrier,
declined 1 percent from the close in Hong Kong.  The Nikkei 225 has fallen 4.7 percent in the past two days,
extending a retreat since May 22 to 17 percent. The yen
strengthened to 97.43 per dollar as of 7:41 a.m. in Tokyo,
earlier touching a seven-week high, up from 99.11 at the close
of Japanese equity markets yesterday.  The euro-area will return to growth by the end of the year,
Draghi told a press conference after ECB policy makers left
their benchmark rate at 0.5 percent. The U.S. Labor Department
is expected to indicate that employers added 163,000 to non-farm
payrolls last month, compared with the 165,000 gain in April,
based on estimates from a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Bond Purchases  The yen has weakened 21.5 percent in the past year, the
most among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, after Abe pledged to boost
economic growth and the BOJ doubled monthly bond purchases.  The Bank of New York Mellon Japan ADR Index climbed 0.4
percent after earlier falling as much as 1.6 percent. The gauge
that tracks U.S.-listed shares of Japanese companies has tumbled
13 percent since reaching an almost five-year high on May 15.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell below 13,000 on June 6
for the first time in two months as utilities and exporters
slumped. A gauge of small-cap stocks fell the most since after
the 2011 earthquake. Only 121 of the Topix Index’s 1,709
companies rose. All 33  industry groups  fell, led by machinery
companies and utilities.  The Nikkei 225 and the Topix index remain this year’s best-performing major equity gauges among developed nations, both
rising at least 24 percent this year.  Futures on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.6 percent and
contracts on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland
Chinese companies trading in Hong Kong retreated 0.4 percent.
The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. climbed 1 percent in New York yesterday.  Australian Futures  Futures on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.1 percent
and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, has slumped 9 percent through yesterday from a
close to five-year high on May 20. That left the gauge yesterday
 trading at  12.8 times average estimated earnings compared with
14.8 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.9 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed. The gauge yesterday rose 0.9 percent, erasing earlier
losses, to snap a two-day losing streak as investors weighed the
Federal Reserve’s stimulus plans before a report on employment
growth today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
