Canada’s competition agency said
charges have been laid against Nestlé Canada Inc., Mars Canada
Inc. and an independent distributor network saying they formed a
cartel to raise chocolate prices.  Three individuals were also charged, the Competition Bureau
said in a statement from Ottawa today. The agency has
recommended that Hershey Canada Inc. receive “lenient
treatment” because it cooperated with the investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
