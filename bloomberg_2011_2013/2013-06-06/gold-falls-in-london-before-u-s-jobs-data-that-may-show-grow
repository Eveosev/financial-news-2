Gold declined in  London  before U.S.
jobs data that economists say will show growth, adding to
evidence for the  Federal Reserve  to curb monetary stimulus.  Payrolls probably increased 165,000 jobs in May, matching
growth the month before, according to the median of 88 economist
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Gold has dropped 17 percent
this year.  “Significant technical damage has been done to gold in
recent months and momentum traders are still the dominant force
in the market,” said Mark O’Byrne, executive director of
GoldCore Ltd. in Dublin. “In the long term, gold’s price will be
decided not by traders but rather by broad based global physical
deamnd which remains quite robust.’’  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.7 percent to $1,394.30
an ounce by 8:58 a.m. in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
