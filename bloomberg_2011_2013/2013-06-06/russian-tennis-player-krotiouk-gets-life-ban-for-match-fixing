Russian tennis player Sergei Krotiouk
was banned from the sport for life and fined $60,000 after he
was found guilty of 41 charges relating to match-fixing.  The Tennis Integrity Unit said the charges covered breaches
of the sport’s anti-corruption program during 2012 and 2013 and
related to attempts to influence “the outcome or any other
aspect of any event,” to “facilitate any player not to use his
or her best efforts in any event” and to offer or provide money
or other benefit “with the intention of negatively
influencing” a player’s best efforts.  “The life ban applies with immediate effect and means that
Mr. Krotiouk is not eligible to participate in any tournament or
competition organized or sanctioned by the governing bodies of
professional tennis from the date of this statement,” the
 integrity unit said  yesterday.  Krotiouk, 34, is ranked 789th by the ATP World Tour and
spent his career playing on the second- and third-tier
Challenger and Futures circuits. He’s the third men’s player to
be handed a life ban in the past two years.  Serbia’s David Savic, who had a career-high ranking of 363,
and  Austria ’s Daniel Koellerer, who reached the third round of
the U.S. Open in 2009, both were sanctioned in 2011.  The Tennis Integrity Unit is a joint initiative of the
Grand Slam Committee, the International Tennis Federation, the
ATP World Tour and the women’s WTA Tour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
