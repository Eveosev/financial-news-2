Glencore Xstrata Plc bought North Sea
Forties crude at higher price than yesterday. The company also
sold Russian Urals blend at a smaller discount than the last
trade in the Mediterranean.  Nexen Inc. halted its Buzzard oil field after an equipment
failure, Karen Fordyce, a spokeswoman for the company in
Aberdeen,  Scotland , said in an e-mailed statement.  Daily exports of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk crudes
will rebound 18 percent in July from an eight-month low in June,
loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Glencore bought Forties lot F0621 for June 28 to June 30
from  BP Plc (BP/)  at parity to Dated Brent, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window. That compares with yesterday’s trade at a discount of 15
cents a barrel.  Glencore didn’t manage to buy a second cargo for June 20 to
June 26 at 10 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, while BP was
unable to sell Forties for June 24 to June 26 at a premium of 15
cents, the survey showed.  BP withdrew its offer for Ekofisk cargo C11386 for July 1
to July 3 at $1 a barrel more than Dated Brent, the survey
showed. This shipment was deferred by three days, according to a
revised shipping schedule. Shipment C11385 was also delayed by
three days to load on July 3, the plan showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell by 10 cents to a discount of 5 cents a barrel
to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for July settlement traded at $103.65 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $103.93 in the previous session. The August contract was at
$103.40 at the same time today, a discount of 25 cents to July.  The equipment failure on Buzzard has “resulted in a
temporary production outage, repairs are underway,” Fordyce
said. “Production levels are expected to return to normal
levels over the weekend.”  The share of crude produced from Buzzard fell to 40 percent
in the week ending June 2, compared with 42 percent a week
earlier, BP said on its website.  Shipments of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk will
average 851,613 barrels a day in July versus 720,000 barrels in
June, which was the least since October, according to the plans.  Ekofisk loadings are set to jump to 12 cargoes from one
this month after the completion of planned maintenance.  Shipments of Forties in July are planned at 20 cargoes of
600,000 barrels each, one less than this month, a program
showed.  Crude shipments from Dansk Undergrunds Consortium will be
five cargoes in July, two more than this month, while Alvheim
exports will be unchanged at four lots of 780,000 barrels,
according to plans.  Aasgard exports will be seven cargoes, one more than this
month, while Grane shipments will increase by one lot to five
cargoes of 600,000 barrels, schedules showed.  Mediterranean/Urals  Glencore sold 80,000 metric tons of Urals for June 27 to
July 1 loading to  Eni SpA (ENI)  at 35 cents a barrel less than Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed.
That compares with a discount of 45 cents for the last trade on
May 30.  Glencore failed to sell a second Urals cargo for June 17 to
June 21 in the same region at a discount of 60 cents a barrel,
according to the survey.  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 5 cents to a discount of
38 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was 12 cents a barrel
to the benchmark, versus a 10-cent discount yesterday.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend was unchanged at $2.18 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
