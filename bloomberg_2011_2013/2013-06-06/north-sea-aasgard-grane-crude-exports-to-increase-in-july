Exports of North Sea Aasgard crude
for July will be seven cargoes, one more than in June, a loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The July program will total 5.985 million barrels, or
193,065 barrels a day, compared with 175,833 barrels a day this
month, according to the plan.  Loadings of Grane will increase to five cargoes of 600,000
barrels each, one more than this month, a separate plan showed.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil company, operates the two
fields. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
