Consumer confidence  last week was
unchanged near a five-year high as Americans had the least
pessimistic views on the economy since 2008.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index held at minus 29.7 in
the period ended June 2. Sentiment about the current state of
the economy improved to the best level since January 2008, and
opinions on personal finances were at a one-year high.  Rebounds in housing and stocks have helped upper-income
Americans recover much of the wealth lost during the recession,
while a drop in firings is probably making the average worker
feel more secure in their jobs. At the same time, wage gains
that have barely kept up with inflation and a jump in  interest
rates  may be starting to suppress buying plans, raising concern
about the outlook for spending.  “People are more certain about their own employment and
wage prospects,” said  Joseph Brusuelas , a senior economist at
Bloomberg LP in  New York . “The rising equity and home prices
are certainly having an interesting effect on upper-income
Americans, who seem to have captured a portion of the recovery
in overall national wealth.”  Sentiment for households earning between $75,000 and
$100,000 annually reached a five-year high, eclipsing confidence
among the highest income earners.  Fewer Americans filed applications for  unemployment
benefits  last week, indicating companies are confident demand
will be sustained in the face of  federal budget  cuts and tax
increases, other figures showed today.  Fewer Claims  Jobless  claims  decreased by 11,000 to 346,000 in the week
ended June 1 from 357,000, the Labor Department reported. The
total number of people receiving benefits declined to 2.95
million. It reached a five-year low of 2.92 million two weeks
ago.  Stocks rose as investors consider whether the  Federal
Reserve  will begin scaling back stimulus. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index climbed 0.1 percent to 1,609.98 at 9:54 a.m. in New
York.  Two of the comfort index’s components improved last week.
The gauge on consumers’ current view about the economy climbed
to minus 53 from minus 54.7, while the measure of personal
finances rose to 4.6, its best reading since April 2012, from
2.8.  Fewer consumers said the time was right to purchase needed
items, as a measure of the buying climate fell to minus 40.8, a
two-month low, from minus 37.3 a week earlier. The measure
reached a more than five-year high of minus 31.5 four weeks ago.  Mortgage Rates  During that time,  mortgage rates  have skyrocketed amid
concern Federal Reserve policy makers will scale back on the
amount of bonds they buy each month. The rate on a 30-year fixed
home loan shot up to 3.81 percent in the week ended May 30, the
highest level in a year, from 3.35 percent in the week ended May
2, according to  figures  from  Freddie Mac . It reached a record-low 3.31 percent in late November.  Other reports on buyer sentiment have followed the comfort
index in showing improvement. The Conference Board’s confidence
index rose in May to the highest level since February 2008,
while the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan sentiment gauge
reached its highest level since July 2007.  A housing market rebound could be brightening moods. The
S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of property values in 20 cities increased
10.9 percent in the year to March, the biggest 12-month gain
since April 2006, a report showed last month.  Consumer Spending  Household purchases climbed at a 3.4 percent annualized
rate in the first quarter, almost twice as fast as the prior
quarter’s 1.8 percent gain. That helped the economy strengthen,
with gross domestic product rising at a 2.4 percent pace
compared with a 0.4 percent advance in the last three months of
2012, a Commerce Department report showed last week.  Rising property and stock values are helping Americans cope
with an increase in payroll taxes, after the levy funding social
security reverted to its 2010 level of 6.2 percent in January
from a reduced 4.2 percent rate.  The gauge for consumers earning between $75,000 and
$100,000 climbed to 8.9 last week, its highest level since
November 2007, eclipsing confidence among highest wage earners.
Among Americans with annual incomes of $100,000 or more, the
Bloomberg comfort index retreated to 8 from 8.3 a week earlier.  Households earning between $50,000 and $75,000 a year
declined for the fourth week, falling to minus 23.1 from minus
22.4.  Restaurants are among businesses struggling to overcome a
tough environment for those in lower-income brackets.  Competition Intensifying  “The sluggish economy has affected consumer confidence and
has led to an intensified competitive environment over the past
several quarters in the restaurant sector,” said Cynthia J.
Devine, chief financial officer of fast food franchise  Tim
Horton’s Inc. (THI)  in a June 4 presentation.  Among other demographics, women’s confidence rose last week
to its highest level since early January 2008, at minus 30.9.
The index among whites climbed to minus 27.5, its highest since
January 2008.  Seniors also grew more optimistic, with the gauge for those
65 and older rising to minus 20.4, its best in more than five
years and the highest among all age groups.  Sentiment for consumers living in the West swelled 5.6
points to minus 31.1, though the Midwest remains the most
confident region at minus 22.6.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index conducts telephone
surveys with a random sample of 1,000 consumers 18 and older.
Each week, 250 respondents are asked for their views on the
economy, personal finances and buying climate. The percentage of
negative responses is subtracted from the share of positive
views and divided by three. The most recent reading is based on
the average of responses over the previous four weeks. The
margin of error for the figure is 3 percentage points.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
