Hasselblad, the Swedish camera company, has launched a  $7,000 digital camera , marketing its style and ease of use. It certainly is handsome. It certainly is $7,000. How does $400 sound instead?  For that, you can get one of the used Hasselblad film cameras, which were largely discarded with the advent of digital photography. (Both prices include a lens. For extra perspective, consider that  new, professional digital Hasselblads  go for upwards of $20,000.) The price of all film cameras has plummeted, but Hasselblad is a special case. Its medium-format machines -- which take pictures on negatives much larger than the normal 35mm size, making for finer resolution -- remained virtually unchanged for the better part of 50 years. "Essentially, you could take a 1957 Hasselblad lens and put it on a 2002 body," says Todd Murphy, president and CEO of  KEH , which bills itself as the largest used-camera dealer in the world. Then, in 2002, Hasselblad introduced the H series, which uses a different lens mount. Half a century's worth of equipment became obsolete.  "Right around 2003, 2004, is when all of the medium-format pricing really started taking a hit," Murphy recalls. "It's gone down really substantially, probably about 70% or so." He cites a 500CM model with an A12 back and an 80mm lens that sold new for about $1,500 and can now be had for $400. $400! Wait. Isn't digital photography easier? Easier to shoot, doesn't require film and you can look at the image right after you take it?  Yes. But if you're like many people, you use your phone for everyday photography and a real camera for special occasions. For that, film photography can still compete with digital. "There were a couple of years there where we were sitting here, twiddling our thumbs, thinking maybe we should take up ceramics or something," says Jim Megargee, owner and master printer at New York's  MV Photo Labs , who charges $45 a roll to hand-develop and then scan medium-format film. "But all of a sudden there was a resurgence of interest. We're seeing clients coming back" from digital photography.  Murphy also uses the word "resurgence" to describe the increased sales in film cameras. "Hasselblad is our third-best-selling product," he says, likening its renaissance to the rebirth of LP sales.  Silver halide on plastic -- it isn't for everyone, and it never will be again. But it's a stubborn, super-high-quality medium, and for the time being we find ourselves with a glut of world-class cameras that cost a fraction of their modern digital counterparts.  The film stays in the picture. James Tarmy reports on arts and culture for  Bloomberg Muse , the arts and leisure section of Bloomberg News.
