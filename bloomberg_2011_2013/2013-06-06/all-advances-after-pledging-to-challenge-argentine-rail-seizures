ALL America Latina Logistica SA (ALLL3)  rose
the most in two weeks after the Brazilian freight company said
it will challenge Argentina’s decision to revoke its licenses.  The shares gained 1.8 percent to 10.94 reais at 1:20 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, its biggest one-day advance since May 22 on a
closing basis. The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  fell 0.6 percent.  Argentina expropriated a cargo railway concession and a
tourist train concession from ALL on June 4, citing
noncompliance with contractual agreements. ALL incurred
“grave” contract violations by failing to invest and
accumulating fines worth 30 percent of the concession, Interior
and Transport Minister Florencio Randazzo said in Buenos Aires.  Curitiba, Brazil-based ALL said in a regulatory filing
yesterday after the market closed that it will adopt all
adequate measures to challenge Argentina’s decision to revoke
its concessions.  The  shares  plunged as much as 2 percent yesterday before
closing 0.4 percent lower. ALL has rallied 31 percent this year,
while the benchmark Ibovespa gauge has lost 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
