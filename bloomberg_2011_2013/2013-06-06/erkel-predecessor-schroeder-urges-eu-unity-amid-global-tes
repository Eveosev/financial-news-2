Former German Chancellor  Gerhard Schroeder  urged the European Union to counter strains that are
testing the bloc’s unity to help it meet global challenges.  A Europe of “two-speed” integration is emerging, the
 Social Democrat  said in a speech in London. The 27-country EU is
being tugged in opposite directions by member states that seek
more independence and a core linked to the euro that is growing
together more rapidly, he told the Official Monetary and
Financial Institutions Forum yesterday, according to an e-mailed
transcript.  “The gap has widened between countries that can and wish
to integrate quickly and those that want to move more slowly,
such as the U.K.,” said Schroeder, who was chancellor from 1998
until his defeat by  Angela Merkel  in 2005. In a world of
shifting coordinates of power, “I am convinced that only a
united Europe has a chance of survival,” he said.  Schroeder’s comments highlight the divisions that scar the
EU after three years of sovereign debt crisis, austerity and
spluttering economic growth. The 17-nation euro area has record
unemployment amid a second year of recession, while U.K. Prime
Minister  David Cameron  has promised to hold a referendum on his
country’s membership of the EU by the end of 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
