Ciena Corp. (CIEN) , a maker of
communications-network equipment for phone carriers and other
customers, jumped 17 percent after its third-quarter sales
forecast topped estimates.  Revenue in the period will be $515 million to $545 million,
the Hanover, Maryland-based company said today when it released
its second-quarter results. Analysts had predicted $509.4
million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ciena is benefiting from surging demand for fiber-optic
networking gear, which speeds communications by sending data via
light. The company also offers software and other tools to help
transmit information more efficiently at a time when  Internet
traffic  is booming.  “The carriers’ shift in spending is happening and it’s
going to be big over a long period of time,” Chief Executive
Officer  Gary Smith  said in an interview.  To adjust to the shift, Ciena has broadened its product
lineup and expanded its efforts in services and software, the
CEO said.  “Today, 70 percent of our engineering team is in software
development,” said Smith.  The shares rose 17 percent to $19.15 at the close in  New
York , marking the biggest single-day gain since September 2011.
The stock has advanced 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
