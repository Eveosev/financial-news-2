Soybeans dropped amid growing
optimism that the global harvest will beat the  record  estimated
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture last month.  Soybeans for delivery in July lost as much as 0.8 percent
to $15.1925 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, and were at
$15.265 at 11:12 a.m. in  Singapore  on volume that was 23 percent
above the 100-day average for that time of day.  The global soybean crop will total 286.597 million metric
tons in the year beginning Sept. 1, bigger than the 282.703
million tons predicted last month,  Memphis , Tennessee-based
researcher Informa Economics Inc. said in report to clients
yesterday. That compares with the USDA’s forecast of a record
285.5 million tons. The Washington-based agency is due to update
its outlook on world crop supplies on June 12.  “Prices are declining because traders are expecting the
USDA to raise its estimate on global production in its next
report,”  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager for research at
Nihon Unicom Inc. said from  Tokyo . “That means increased
competition among suppliers of both soybeans and corn.”  The world corn harvest will total 966.95 million tons in
the year that starts July 1, up from a forecast of 966.522
million tons last month, Informa said. That compares with the
USDA’s prediction of 966 million tons last month.  Corn for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to $5.435 a
bushel in Chicago, while wheat for July delivery added 0.1
percent to $7.025 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
