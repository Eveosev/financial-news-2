Richard Dorfman, the head of the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association’s
securitization group, is leaving the organization.  Dorfman will be replaced on an acting basis by Chris Killian, who has been with Wall Street’s largest lobbying group
for eight years, according to an internal memo, the contents of
which were confirmed by Katrina Cavalli, a Sifma spokeswoman.
She declined to comment further, and Dorfman didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail message.  Dorfman, a former head of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Atlanta and one-time ABN Amro executive,  joined  the organization
in 2010 to head an arm created by the group after the American
Securitization Forum broke its affiliation with Sifma.  The forum faced its own raft of defections this year,
including most of its board, amid a dispute between members and
the executive director. The interests of companies involved in
the market for securities backed by loans and leases are now
also being represented by the new  Structured Finance Industry
Group .  In addition to lobbying policy makers on behalf of members,
Sifma’s role in the securitization market includes setting rules
for so-called To Be Announced trading in the government-backed
mortgage-bond market, the method used for more than 90 percent
of about $100 trillion in annual volumes, according to Federal
Reserve  research  and Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
