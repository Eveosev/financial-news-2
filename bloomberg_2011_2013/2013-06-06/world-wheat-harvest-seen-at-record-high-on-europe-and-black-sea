The world will reap its biggest wheat
crop ever in the coming season as larger harvests in  Europe  and
the  Black Sea  region lift stockpiles, according to the
Agricultural Market Information System.  Production will climb to 702 million metric tons in the
2013-14 season starting July 1 from 659 million tons in 2012-13,
Rome-based AMIS, which was set up by Group of 20 countries,
wrote in an  online report  today. That will rebuild inventories
and reduce trade as importers in Asia and Europe grow more of
the grain at home, the report showed.  Wheat traded in  Chicago , a global benchmark, fell about 10
percent this year on the outlook for rising production. The
projected rebound follows drought last year that hurt harvests
in Russia,  Ukraine , southern Europe and the U.S. The global
forecast from AMIS exceeded estimates by the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  and the International Grains Council.  “Early indications for world wheat, maize and rice
production in 2013 point to record levels and an overall
increase in supplies in the new 2013-14 marketing season,” AMIS
wrote, using another name for corn.  Wheat stockpiles may climb to 173 million tons from 164
million tons in 2012-13 as trade shrinks to 136 million tons
from 140 million tons, according to the report.  Animal Feed  Consumption of the grain is predicted to rise to 694
million tons next season from 686 million tons as  animal-feed 
use returns to “more normal levels” and food demand keeps pace
with  population growth , AMIS wrote.  Global corn production is predicted to jump to 963 million
tons from 873 million tons, mainly on an expected rebound in the
U.S. crop, AMIS said. Consumption will climb to 923 million tons
from 879 million tons on higher feed use, it said.  Corn ending stocks in 2013-14 may expand to 174 million
tons from 135 million tons, the report showed.  AMIS predicted an increase in the global  rice  harvest to
499 million tons from 490 million tons on expected improved
weather in  Asia , with production gains limited on a more
positive price outlook for other crops.  World rice consumption is forecast at 491 million tons from
478 million tons, while stocks will climb to 182 million tons
from 174 million tons, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
