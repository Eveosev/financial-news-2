Wall Street banks are cutting their
investment-grade bond holdings as the securities lose the most
since the 2008 credit crisis amid mounting concern the Federal
Reserve will slow its stimulus efforts.  Dealers sold a net $3.1 billion of the notes during the
past week,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  credit strategists wrote in a
note today. The biggest banks are paring inventories even as
investors absorb $16 billion of new debt issuance in a weakening
market, which is unusual, said the strategists led by  Eric Beinstein  in New York.  The selling comes after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
May 22 the central bank could slow unprecedented stimulus if the
U.S. unemployment outlook shows sustainable improvement. Dollar-denominated investment-grade bonds are declining 0.2 percent
this month following a 2.3 percent loss in May, the biggest
since October 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data.  “It may reflect dealers coming into this selloff period
longer than they wished,” the JPMorgan strategists wrote.
“Presumably they are less long now.”  The most-creditworthy borrowers have sold $562.2 billion of
bonds in the U.S. this year, more than the $496.5 billion issued
by this time in 2012, when a record $1.12 trillion of the debt
was sold, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
