German stocks  fell, erasing earlier
gains, as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said he
sees “downside” risks to the euro-area economy and additional
policy measures are being kept “on the shelf.”  The  DAX Index (DAX)  slipped 0.4 percent to 8,163.29 at 3:12 p.m.
in  Frankfurt , having earlier risen as much as 0.5 percent. The
HDAX Index also retreated 0.4 percent.  The ECB kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5
percent today. That matched the forecasts of 57 of 59  economists 
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Morgan Stanley and IHS Global
Insight had predicted a quarter-point reduction.  The Bank of England left its  bond-purchase target  at 375
billion pounds ($579 billion) and its key interest rate at 0.5
percent, as predicted by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  A report from  Germany ’s Economy Ministry today showed that
 factory orders  in Europe’s largest economy decreased 2.3 percent
in April, a bigger decline than the 1 percent drop  forecast  in a
Bloomberg survey. They climbed a revised 2.3 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
