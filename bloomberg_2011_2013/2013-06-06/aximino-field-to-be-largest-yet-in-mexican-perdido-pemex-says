Petroleos Mexicanos’s Maximino field
will probably be the largest oil discovery on the Mexican side
of the Perdido basin, the state-owned oil producer said.  Final test results on the field are expected within weeks,
said Carlos Morales, the exploration and production chief at
Pemex, as the Mexico City-based company is known. Morales spoke
to reporters today at an oil conference in Cancun.  Pemex is exploring deep waters in a bid to replicate
success in U.S. waters by companies including Chevron Corp.,
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and to
restore lost output after Mexico’s biggest discovery, Cantarell,
collapsed over the past decade. Pemex officials have called
Maximino the “jewel in the crown” of its deepwater portfolio.  Maximino, Pemex’s third ultra-deepwater discovery in the
Perdido area of the Gulf, is at a depth of 2,900 meters (9,515
feet), the most ever for the oil producer. Last year Pemex made
its first two commercially viable deepwater discoveries in the
Perdido area after 23 attempts. Perdido is about 200 miles (320
kilometers) east of the Texas-Mexico border in the Gulf of
Mexico.  Exploration in Maximino, originally scheduled for November
2010, was delayed several times amid safety concerns that
prompted Pemex to try ultra deepwater equipment in shallower
projects.  To contact the reporters on this story:
