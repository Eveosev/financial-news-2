Volga-Dnepr Airlines, the world’s
biggest carrier of outsize air freight, said it will deploy as
many as three upgraded Ilyushin Il-76 freighters at Paris-Vatry
airport to develop a new cargo hub for western Europe.  Volga-Dnepr will establish a base at the airport east of
the French capital after last year taking delivery of the fifth
and final Il-76TD-90VD aircraft modified with new engines and
avionics to meet stricter standards on noise and emissions.  The revamped planes are able to serve markets in Europe,
 North America ,  Japan  and  Australia  that banned older versions of
the Il-76 in 2000, Volga-Dnepr said today in a statement.  “Vatry has an excellent central location that is within
easy reach of customers across Europe,” Volga-Dnepr Sales
Director Dmitry Grishin said in the release.  The planes are produced at the Chkalov Aviation Factory in
Tashkent, Uzbekistan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
