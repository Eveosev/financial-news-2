Brazil ’s swap rates climbed to a one-year high as the central bank cited unfavorable inflation in
minutes of its May meeting, encouraging speculation that it will
step up the pace of increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015 rose
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 9.19 percent at
9:54 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the highest level on a closing basis
since May 2012. The real appreciated 0.4 percent to 2.1197 per
 U.S. dollar  after falling yesterday toward the four-year
intraday low of 2.1495.  “The central bank’s inflation concern increased,” Flavio Serrano, a senior economist at Banco Espirito Santo de
Investimento in  Sao Paulo , said in a telephone interview. “The
minutes were slightly hawkish.”  The real pared its decline yesterday as the central bank
intervened in the  currency market  after the government’s removal
of a 6 percent tax on foreign investors who buy Brazilian bonds
in the domestic market failed to produce a sustained rally.  To contact the reporters on this story:
