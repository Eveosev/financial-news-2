General Motors Co. (GM) , aiming to
increase customer loyalty, announced it will expand its free
scheduled maintenance program to most 2014 Chevrolet, Buick and
GMC vehicles in the U.S.  “It makes sense to do this to kick the ownership
experience off on the” right foot, Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson said today in a speech during the company’s annual
shareholder’s meeting at its Detroit headquarters. “We know
that customers who service their vehicles at our dealerships are
much more likely to purchase another GM product.”  Akerson wants to improve consumer satisfaction at GM to
increase profit. The company estimates it can generate $700
million in revenue for every additional percentage point of
customer retention. It’s part of his strategy to increase GM’s
North American operating margins to 10 percent by mid-decade
from an average of 7.4 percent during the past three years.  The program for most 2014 model year Chevrolet, Buick and
GMC vehicles covers routine oil changes, tire rotation and other
basic maintenance,  Jim Cain , a GM spokesman, said. GM already
offers a four-year or 50,000 mile free maintenance program for
Cadillac.  Shares of the Detroit-based company rose 1.2 percent to
$34.44 at the close in  New York . GM has gained 19 percent this
year, compared with a 14 percent advance for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  Akerson, 64, who became CEO in 2010 on the eve of the
company’s initial public offering, has also set goals of
stemming losses in  Europe  and increasing China sales to 5
million from  2.84 million  last year.  GM’s Return  The automaker signaled in April that Akerson may retire
within three years by readjusting the mix of his compensation so
that he could benefit from long-term compensation before
leaving. He has said he doesn’t know when he’ll retire.  S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC said June 3 that GM is replacing
H.J. Heinz Co. in the  S&P 500 . GM, which had been in the S&P 500
since the index was established in 1957 until its 2009
bankruptcy, will be added to the gauge today.  GM’s return to the S&P 500 is a milestone for the company
since emerging from a 2009 reorganization and $49.5 billion U.S.
government bailout that became a centerpiece of President  Barack Obama ’s first term. Optimism about GM is growing as the  U.S.
Treasury  sells down its stake and the stock on May 17 topped the
$33 a share initial public offering price for the first time in
two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
