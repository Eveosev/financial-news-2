Swiss stocks  declined, extending a
six-week low for the Swiss Market Index, as the  European Central
Bank  cut its forecast for euro-area economic growth this year,
while President  Mario Draghi  said additional policy measures are
being kept “on the shelf.”  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and UBS AG followed European peers
lower. Zurich Insurance Group AG, Switzerland’s largest insurer,
lost 1.9 percent.  SGS SA (SGSN) , the world’s biggest product inspector,
posted the best performance on the equity gauge.  The  SMI (SMI)  slid 1.6 percent to 7,622.74 at the close of
trading in Zurich, posting the biggest two-day drop since
November 2011. The index retreated in the past two weeks as
investors speculated that an improving U.S. economy will lead
the  Federal Reserve  to pare stimulus measures. The broader Swiss
Performance Index dropped 1.5 percent today.  “The mood is currently a bit more cautious,” said Jean-Paul Jeckelmann, chief investment officer at Banque Bonhote &
Cie. in Neuchatel,  Switzerland , who helps manage $1.4 billion in
equities. “In the last few weeks good news was good news and
bad news was good news. After the run-up we have seen in the
market, many investors are looking for reasons to take profit.”  Draghi said the ECB cut its forecast for the 17-nation euro
area’s economy to show contraction of 0.6 percent this year from
an estimate of minus 0.5 percent made in March. Officials raised
their projection for next year to 1.1 percent from 1 percent.
The ECB cut its 2013 inflation forecast to 1.4 percent from 1.6
percent. The 2014 estimate was unchanged at 1.3 percent.  Additional Measures  Draghi also said policy makers discussed additional
stimulus policies and stand ready to act if needed.  “We had an ample discussion of the various measures, non-standard measures that could be utilized to repair the
transmission policy,” Draghi told reporters in  Frankfurt  after
the policy meeting today. “We see no reason to act on all these
fronts. These are measures we keep on the shelf.”  The ECB earlier kept  interest rates  unchanged at a record
low of 0.5 percent, in line with economists’ forecasts in a
Bloomberg News  survey .  Credit Suisse lost 3.8 percent to 26.51 Swiss francs, its
biggest loss since Feb. 26. The lender may sell part of its
wealth management business in Germany, according to three people
with knowledge of the matter. The bank may focus on ultra-rich
clients and sell the remainder to boost the profitability of the
German business, said two of the people, who asked not to be
identified because the deliberations are private.  Banks, Insurers  UBS fell 1.8 percent to 16.39 francs and Zurich Insurance
dropped 1.9 percent to 243.20 francs. Swiss Life Holding AG
retreated 2.3 percent to 154.50 francs, while Baloise Holding AG
lost 2 percent to 90.35 francs. Gauges of banks and insurers
posted the  biggest drops  of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Syngenta AG (SYNN) , the world’s largest maker of crop chemicals,
retreated 0.9 percent to 366.30 francs.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the biggest supplier of offshore oil rigs,
declined 2.4 percent to 46.81 francs.  SGS gained 0.9 percent to 2,132 francs, snapping two days
of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
