Spanish bonds declined for a second
day as the European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged
amid speculation policy makers will unveil no new measures to
support the region’s economy.  Spain’s 10-year yield approached a six-week high as the
nation sold 4.02 billion euros ($5.27 billion) of debt due
between 2015 and 2023. The ECB, which is also to announce growth
and inflation forecasts today, held its refinancing rate at a
 record-low  0.5 percent, in line with the forecast of all but two
of 59 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. ECB President Mario Draghi is to hold a press conference to explain the decision at
2:30 p.m. in  Frankfurt . German bonds were little changed.  “The ECB is not expected to come up with any new measures
today,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at
ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “With Spain’s finances still
vulnerable and the global appetite for risk appearing to be
waning, Spanish bonds may come under pressure in the near
term.”  Spain’s  10-year bond  yield climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4.46 percent at 12:56 p.m.  London 
time. The 5.4 percent security due January 2023 fell 0.12, or
1.20 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 107.225. The rate
climbed to 4.53 percent on June 3, the most since April 22.  The yield on 10-year Italian debt securities also rose two
basis points, to 4.15 percent.  The ECB lowered its main refinancing rate by 25 basis
points on May 2 and Draghi signaled then he’s prepared to cut
borrowing costs again if economic data worsen. Morgan Stanley &
Co. and IHS Global Insight were the only companies predicting a
further quarter-point reduction today.  ‘Little Action’  “There might be a lot of words and little action in this
meeting,” said Niels From, chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB in
Copenhagen. “The focus will be on the press conference and also
on the economic forecasts. I expect a dovish tone, which will be
supportive of bunds.”  Germany ’s  10-year bund  yielded 1.51 percent after climbing
to 1.57 percent on June 3, the highest since Feb. 25.  Spain sold 1.49 billion euros of bonds due in October 2023
at an average yield of 4.517 percent. The nation first sold the
October 2023 securities being offered today via banks on May 14,
at a rate of 4.452 percent.  It also sold two- and three-year notes as it exceeded its 4
billion-euro pre-auction target.  France  sold 7.99 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2020,
2023 and 2027.  Widening Spread  The nation’s 10-year yield rose two basis points to 2.08
percent, widening its spread with the rate on similar-maturity
bunds two basis points to 57 basis points.  Investors also sold bonds in  emerging markets . Hungary’s
10-year yields rose to 5.89 percent, the highest on a closing
basis since April 8 as traders pared bets the nation’s central
bank will continue to lower borrowing costs after 10 consecutive
months of easing. Bond yields also rose in  Poland ,  Russia  and
South Africa.  German bonds were little changed after a report showed the
country’s  factory orders  fell more than economists predicted in
April as Europe’s largest economy struggled to gain strength.  Orders decreased 2.3 percent from March, when they
increased a revised 2.3 percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin
said today. Economists forecast a 1 percent drop, according to
the median of 39 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  HSBC Holdings Plc said the recent rise in German bond
yields is offering an opportunity to buy as 10-year rates will
fall to 1.2 percent later this year.  “Growth remains weak in many of the largest economies and
recovery hopes may be in vain,” wrote  Steven Major , global head
of fixed-income research at HSBC in London. “Back at the top of
their recent range, core bonds are at attractive entry levels.”  German securities  handed investors a loss of 0.7 percent
this year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. Spanish bonds returned 6.5 percent, according to a
separate index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
