British and Irish Lions rugby captain
Sam Warburton will make his debut in two days against the
 Queensland Reds , the second of five games in Australia before
the touring team faces the Wallabies in a Test series.  Wales flanker Warburton sat out the Lions’ opening two wins
on their tour to  Hong Kong  and Australia because of a knee
injury. Ireland’s Paul O’Connell and  Brian O’Driscoll  led the
team against the Barbarians and Western Force, respectively, in
his absence.  Lock Geoff Parling, prop  Matt Stevens , hooker Tom Youngs
and his brother and scrum-half Ben Youngs were also chosen to
make their first Lions starts against the Reds, who earlier
included 12 Wallabies in their team for the match that will
played be at the same Brisbane stadium as the first Test on June
22.  “Two games and two victories is great, but those two
matches are building blocks as we head toward the Test series,”
Lions coach Warren Gatland said in a statement. “We always said
we would give every player a start in the first three matches
and this team reflects that. It also provides us with the
opportunity to continue to look at different combinations.”  Reds fly-half  Quade Cooper  and back-rower Jake Schatz will
be among those seeking to impress Wallabies coach  Robbie Deans ,
who will add a final six players to his squad for the Lions
series next week.  The Lions beat the Barbarians 59-8 last weekend in Hong
Kong before routing the Force 69-17 yesterday in Perth.
