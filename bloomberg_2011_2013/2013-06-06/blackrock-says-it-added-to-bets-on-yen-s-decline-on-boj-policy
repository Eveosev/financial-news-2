BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
money manager, said it added to a bet that the yen would weaken,
citing the potential for the Bank of Japan to add to economic
stimulus measures that tend to debase the currency.  “We remain underweight Japanese  government bonds  and have
increased our short-yen position,’’ Scott Thiel, deputy chief
investment officer of fundamental fixed-income in London, said
today in an e-mailed statement. “The JGB market has remained
volatile for some time, following the BOJ’s announcement that it
would significantly increase its loose monetary policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
