Cool Planet Energy Systems Inc., a
closely held biofuel developer, raised about $29.9 million to
build its first production facility, Chief Financial Officer
Barry Rowan said.  The debt investments are part of $100 million Cool Planet
expects to raise this year that’ll be converted into equity at
completion, Rowan said today by telephone. The funds will be
invested in the company’s first commercial plant that will
convert biomass and organic wastes into about 10 million gallons
of gasoline a year, he said.  Chief Executive Officer Howard Janzen said Oct. 24 that he
plans to build 30 of the company’s shipping-container-sized
manufacturing units within three years that may produce fuel for
about $1.50 a gallon.  The first plant is expected to be completed by the end of
2014, though the location hasn’t been determined, Rowan said.
Cool Planet, based in Camarillo,  California , has supply
contracts that cover its expected production through 2016, he
said, and wouldn’t name the customers.  Cool Planet’s  investors  include  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  General
Electric Co. (GE) ,  BP Plc. (BP/) ,  ConocoPhillips (COP) ,  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)  and
 Exelon Corp (EXC) , and each participated in the funding, Rowan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
