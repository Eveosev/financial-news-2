Israel Englander’s Millennium Management LLC is hiring traders from  UBS AG (UBSN) ’s hedge-fund unit with help from an unlikely source: the Swiss bank’s own clients.  At least four portfolio managers have left UBS O’Connor LLC since April for Millennium, lured by signing bonuses and offers to replace deferred compensation owed to them by  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, said three people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because the  departures  haven’t been made public. Millennium, which oversees about $17.8 billion, can pass on the cost of those incentives directly to its backers, among them UBS’s asset-management unit, because the firm is one of the few hedge funds that charges investors annual operating expenses rather than a fixed management fee, the people said.  Traders at O’Connor began contacting other firms and recruiters after UBS pared immediate cash bonuses and decided to pay some awards in bonds that only vest after five years and can be wiped out if the bank has a capital shortfall,  Bloomberg News  reported in March. The exits underscore the struggle banks face in keeping talent as  shareholders  and regulators seek pay curbs.  “The banks over the past 10 years got used to being in the hedge-fund business,” said  Charles Geisst , a finance professor at  Manhattan College  in Riverdale,  New York . “They now realize it’s too big a risk. If you are a trader addicted to risk, I would advise you go do it at a stand-alone hedge fund.”  Ollie Gadney, a spokesman at UBS, and Tripp Kyle, a spokesman for Millennium, declined to comment on the departures.  Compensation Draw  Millennium doesn’t adhere to the typical hedge-fund fee structure of charging clients 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any investment gains, the people said. Instead, it’s among a handful of firms that pass all expenses, excluding marketing costs, to investors. As an investor in the fund, Englander, 64, shares the cost of running the fund with his outside clients, one of the people said. The firm also keeps 20 percent of the profit from investments, the person added.  Hedge funds that use Millennium’s fee model may be willing to pay more to attract talent, because managers don’t have to pay signing bonuses and deferred compensation out of their own pockets, said Charles Morrison, an executive recruiter at Altus Partners Ltd. in  London .  “If you can pay out more than the competition and do so without hesitation, that is obviously a draw,” he said.  Englander, a former floor broker on the  American Stock Exchange , founded Millennium in 1989 with $35 million. The New York-based firm has posted annual investment gains of about 14.5 percent since he started the company, according to investors.  Capital Influx  Millennium has been rebuilding its asset base since investors, who were desperate for cash during the 2008 financial crisis, pulled money. The firm’s main fund, Millennium Partners LP, posted investment losses of about 3 percent in 2008, compared with a record 19 percent  decline  for the broader industry. Still, client redemptions reduced Millennium’s assets under management to $6.9 billion by June 2010 from $13.5 billion in November 2008.  With an influx of capital over the past two years, Millennium has been adding employees. The firm increased headcount by 32 percent to 1,250 people last year, regulatory filings show. The company employs more than 140 portfolio managers investing in stocks and bonds, according to its website.  Ferri Unit  UBS’s Alternative and Quantitative Investments unit, a group run by William Ferri from New York, oversees about $31 billion of clients’ assets. O’Connor, the hedge-fund division within Ferri’s group, is run by Dawn Fitzpatrick, and accounts for about $5.7 billion of those assets. That unit’s core Global Multi-Strategy Fund returned more than 8 percent to investors last year, a person with knowledge of the fund said in March. Multistrategy  hedge funds  fell 4.5 percent on average last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The remainder is invested in funds-of-funds, which charge clients an extra layer of fees to pick hedge funds. That part of the business is overseen by Bruce Amlicke.  UBS funds-of-funds have more than $500 million of clients’ money invested in Millennium, said the people. One UBS fund that has publicly disclosed its Millennium investment is the O’Connor Fund of Funds: Multi-Strategy pool. It invested $22.8 million in Millennium in April 2011, according to a February filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Traders Depart  After portfolio manager Arnaud Langlois left in April to join Englander’s firm, UBS executives told traders the bank had struck a deal under which the companies wouldn’t try to hire employees from each other, the people said. Fellow portfolio managers Felipe Cruz, Mark Napp and Jonathan Jacoby later left O’Connor with plans to take jobs at Millennium, the people said. Langlois, Cruz and Napp are based in London, while Jacoby is based in the U.S. The traders couldn’t be reached through Millennium.  Executives at the hedge fund say there was no agreement with UBS, according to one person with knowledge of the firm’s thinking.  While some O’Connor traders are leaving to join other firms such as  Michael Platt ’s BlueCrest Capital Management LLP and Tudor Investment Corp., others are departing as UBS eliminates jobs. O’Connor is cutting 16 of the 46 positions at its fundamental long-short equity team, a person familiar with the matter said June 3. In all, the unit employs about 90 investment professionals in New York,  Chicago , London,  Hong Kong ,  Singapore  and  Tokyo .
