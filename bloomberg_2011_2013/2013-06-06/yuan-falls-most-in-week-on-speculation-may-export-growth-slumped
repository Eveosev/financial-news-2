The  yuan  fell the most in almost a
month before data forecast to show export growth halved in May,
revealing subdued demand for goods from  China .  Outbound  shipments  rose 7.1 percent in May from a year
earlier, less than half the previous month’s reported 14.7
percent, based on the median estimate of 34 economists ahead of
data due June 8. Gross domestic product growth slowed to 7.7
percent in the first three months from 7.9 percent in the
preceding quarter. Analysts last month trimmed forecasts for the
April-June period to a median projection of 7.8 percent from as
much as 8.20 in April, according to a Bloomberg survey.  The yuan dropped 0.14 percent to 6.1362 per dollar in
 Shanghai , the biggest decline since May 10, according to China
Foreign Exchange Trade System prices. It gained 1.53 percent
this year,  Asia ’s best currency performance, and touched 6.1210
on June 3 and May 27, the strongest level since the government
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  “China’s growth is being downgraded by quite a lot of
analysts,” said  Nizam Idris , head of currency strategy at
Macquarie Group Ltd. in  Singapore . “The market is just
gravitating toward that.” He predicts the yuan will trade in
the range of 6.13 to 6.15 per dollar over the next month.  The government will also report import data on June 8,
followed by releases on prices, industrial production, retail
sales and investment on June 9.  Fake-Data Crackdown  A crackdown on fake invoices used to disguise money flows
is probably cutting China’s trade figures, according to Zhang
Zhiwei, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong
Kong. Analysts in a separate survey last month said January-April export growth was overstated by 4 to 13 percentage points.  The fast pace of the yuan’s appreciation this year may halt
because of conflicting views in the market on the outlook, China
Securities Journal said in a front-page commentary today.  Yuan foreign-exchange positions, a gauge of capital
inflows, may grow at a slower pace of 100 billion yuan to 200
billion yuan a month from May after China’s crackdown on money
inflows, the newspaper reported, citing analysts from China
Merchant Securities Co. The amount increased 1.51 trillion yuan
in the first four months, official data show.  The People’s Bank of China set its  daily fixing  0.03
percent higher at 6.1737 per dollar today. The spot rate is
allowed to diverge from the fixing by a maximum 1 percent.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan declined 0.08
percent to 6.1318 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.05
percent to 6.2520, trading at a 1.9 percent discount to the
onshore  exchange rate .  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.87 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
