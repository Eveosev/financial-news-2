Gold dropped as investors weighed
whether the  U.S. economy  is strong enough for the U.S. Federal
Reserve to pare stimulus and assessed  India ’s latest move to
rein in imports. Silver, platinum and palladium fell.  Spot gold lost as much as 0.5 percent to $1,396.25 an
ounce, and traded at $1,396.65 at 2:16 p.m. in Singapore. Prices
rose 0.3 percent yesterday as a private report showed that U.S.
companies hired fewer workers than projected in May, backing the
case for the Fed to maintain asset purchases.  Gold fell 17 percent this year as the  Dollar Index , little
changed today, rallied 3.5 percent amid speculation that Fed
policy makers will start to wind down bond purchases. India’s
imports may fall as much as 20 percent this year, the All India
Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation said, after the largest
bullion user yesterday increased a duty on inbound shipments.  “India is intent to curb gold demand as previous steps
don’t seem to have worked,” said Feng Liang an analyst at GF
Futures Co. in Guangzhou. “Whether or not the measures are
successful, it does put a dampener on sentiment. The market will
trade in a range as investors look to the jobs data for clues to
the Fed’s next move.”  Data due today and tomorrow may show the number of
applications for U.S. unemployment benefits fell and payrolls
increased. Fed Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , in testimony to
Congress, said that the Fed could scale back stimulus if the
employment outlook showed sustainable improvement.  Bullion for August delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,396.40
an ounce on the Comex in  New York . Cash silver retreated 0.7
percent to $22.4090 an ounce, taking losses this year to 26
percent.  Platinum lost 0.4 percent to $1,506.85 an ounce, and
palladium fell 0.7 percent to $753.15 an ounce. Impala Platinum
Holdings Ltd., the world’s second-biggest producer of the metal,
said yesterday its mines were operating normally after the end
of an unauthorized work stoppage by about 3,000 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
