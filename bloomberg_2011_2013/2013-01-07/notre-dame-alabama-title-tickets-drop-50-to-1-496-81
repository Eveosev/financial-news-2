Ticket prices for tonight’s college
football national championship game between the  University of
Notre Dame  and the  University of Alabama  have dropped 50 percent
in the last month.  The average listing for the Bowl Championship Series title
game at the Orange Bowl in Miami Gardens,  Florida , is $1,496.81,
half the $2,975.49 average on Dec. 1 following the Southeastern
Conference championship, according to ticket-aggregator TiqIQ.
It is the cheapest day-of average for a BCS Championship in the
last three seasons.  TiqIQ spokesman Chris Matcovich said that while it’s not
uncommon for ticket prices to fall in the six-week period
between the end of the regular season to the national title
game, a drop of this magnitude was unusual. He said the decline
was due to an abnormally large amount of tickets for sale and
longer travel distances for both teams’ fan bases.  “When ticket prices started to drop with this overflow of
tickets available, it was too late for many fans because they
also would need flights and lodging,” Matcovich said today in
an e-mail. “This led to even more market softening.”  Notre Dame  (12-0) finished the season with the top BCS
ranking, while  Alabama  (12-1) secured the second spot with a
victory over  Georgia  in the SEC title game. The two schools have
combined for 1,691 victories and 16 Associated Press national
championships in 70 years.  Alabama is a 9 1/2-point favorite, the largest spread for a
national title game since 2003. Las Vegas oddsmakers have
estimated that the popularity of the two teams may lead to a
worldwide betting handle of more than $2 billion.  Previous Drops  Tickets for last year’s BCS championship in  New Orleans , in
which Alabama beat  Louisiana State University , dropped 26
percent in five weeks prior to the contest. The year before,
when Auburn beat  Oregon , ticket prices didn’t dip.  “Although prices dropped leading up to last year’s game,
it wasn’t as bad due to the fact that LSU and Alabama are
located relatively close to New Orleans,” Matcovich said.
“Compared to this year when Alabama fans would have to take a
14-hour drive from Tuscaloosa to Miami.”  There are about 2,200 tickets available on the secondary
market for tonight’s game, Matcovich said. A ticket in the front
behind the Fighting Irish sideline is $3,800, while a front-row
seat behind the Crimson Tide bench is listed for $1,343.  The final average listing for the 2011 BCS championship
game was $3,226.70, 115 percent more than tonight’s game,
according to TiqIQ. Tickets for last year’s championship
averaged $1,918.32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
