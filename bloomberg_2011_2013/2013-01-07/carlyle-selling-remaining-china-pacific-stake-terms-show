Carlyle Group LP (CG)  raised about $796
million from the sale of its remaining shares in  China Pacific
Insurance (Group) Co. (2601) , cementing profits from its largest
investment in  China  as the firm raises money for its biggest
Asia buyout fund.  The Washington-based private-equity firm sold almost 204
million shares, a 2.2 percent stake, in the Shanghai-
headquartered insurer at HK$30.30, the top end of the offering
range of HK$30 to HK$30.30 apiece, according to a document
obtained by Bloomberg News. China Pacific  fell  by the most in
more than a month after rising 23 percent since Dec. 3 amid a
surge in Chinese stocks.  The share sale comes as Carlyle is seeking to raise about
$3.5 billion for its fourth buyout fund in  Asia , its biggest
targeting the region and 37 percent larger than the firm’s last
regional fund, completed in 2010, two people familiar with the
matter said last year. Carlyle’s exit removes a long-term
overhang to China Pacific’s share price and is positive for the
stock, according to Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd., which raised the
insurer’s target price by 21 percent in a report yesterday.  “Investors are expecting insurers to unveil new marketing
strategies as the new year starts, which is positive, and the
rally in the domestic stock market is good for insurers’
investments as well,” said Olive Xia, a Shanghai-based analyst
at Core Pacific Yamaichi International Ltd. “But China
Pacific’s recent upward momentum has been a bit too strong and
needs some adjustment.”  Asia Funds  The Chinese insurer dropped 2.1 percent to HK$30.35 as of
10:56 a.m. local time. The stock has surged 23 percent in  Hong
Kong  trading since Dec. 3, when the benchmark  Shanghai Composite
Index (SHCOMP)  hit an almost four-year low, outpacing the equity gauge’s
16 percent rally since then amid signs the nation’s  economy  is
bottoming out.  Carlyle had raised three Asia funds totaling $5.1 billion
between 1999 and 2010, and invested in China Pacific shares from
its second fund worth $1.8 billion. Carlyle, which started in
China in 1998, bought about 20 percent in China Pacific between
2005 and 2007, its biggest purchase in the nation.  The private-equity firm sold 215.8 million China Pacific
shares at HK$31.15 apiece in Dec. 2010 for HK$6.7 billion ($864
million) after a lock-up period ended, according to a term sheet
obtained by  Bloomberg News  at the time. It sold 415.2 million of
the Chinese insurer’s Hong Kong-listed shares at HK$33.45 each
in January 2011, raising $1.8 billion. In July last year, the
firm planned to sell 250 million shares at HK$30.90, raising
HK$7.73 billion, according to three people with knowledge of the
transactions at the time.  Seven Years  “We have been very privileged and proud to be a major
shareholder in China Pacific Insurance Group for more than seven
years,” Yang Xiang Dong, managing director and co-head of
Carlyle Asia Partners, said in an e-mail statement. “Over these
years, we have worked very closely with the company, company
management and other shareholders in support of transforming
China Pacific into one of the best run and most successful
insurance companies in China and a Fortune Global 500 company.”  Carlyle and  Newark , New Jersey-based  Prudential Financial
Inc. (PRU)  agreed in December 2005 to take a 25 percent stake in China
Pacific Life Insurance Co., a unit of China Pacific, for 3.3
billion  yuan , equivalent to $409 million at the time. The
investment was converted into a stake in the parent company in
2007 and then into China Pacific’s Hong Kong-listed shares in
2009 as the insurer sold stock in the city.  Private-equity funds in China are holding 82 percent of the
companies they’ve invested in since 2007 as the frozen market
for initial public offerings keeps them from exiting, according
to a report from  China First Capital  today.  Funds hold 6,584 companies after disposing of 1,445 and
seeing 20 go bankrupt, according to the Shenzhen-based firm that
advises on private equity and mergers.  --Bei Hu,  Cathy Chan  in Hong Kong and Dingmin Zhang in Beijing.
