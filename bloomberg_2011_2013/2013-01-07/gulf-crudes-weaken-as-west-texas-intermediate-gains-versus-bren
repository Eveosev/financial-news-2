Crude produced offshore in the  Gulf
of Mexico  weakened as U.S. benchmark oil strengthened against
overseas imports.  The  spread  between U.S. West Texas Intermediate and Brent,
the global overseas oil benchmark, tightened 21 cents to $18.01
a barrel at 1:24 p.m.  New York  time, the smallest gap since
September.  Brent is expected to lose some of its premium over WTI as
the  Seaway pipeline  connecting the U.S. supply hub at Cushing,
Oklahoma to refineries on the Gulf Coast, increases to 400,000
barrels a day from 150,000 a day this week. As Brent’s premium
declines, domestic crudes are more attractive to refiners
compared with imports.  “I think that we will see this trend continue now that the
expansion is imminent,” said  Andy Lipow , President of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  plan to
resume service on the 500-mile (805-kilometer) Seaway link at
the 400,000-barrel-a-day rate late this week, Houston-based
spokesman  Rick Rainey  said in an e-mail Jan. 3.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed by 50 cents
to $17.25 a barrel at 12:03 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet also lost 50 cents to trade at
$17.10 above WTI.  Sour Gulf crude grades also weakened. Mars Blend fell 30
cents to a $13.10 premium, while Southern Green Canyon dropped
35 cents to $13.25 above WTI. Thunder House slipped 10 cents to
a $15.40 premium.  Canadian crude grades also weakened against WTI as it
gained against Brent. Western Canada Select, a heavy crude grade
mainly produced from oil-sands bitumen, fell 85 cents to a
$37.75 discount, according to Net Energy Inc., a Calgary oil
broker. Syncrude, a synthetic  crude oil  produced from bitumen,
slipped to a 20-cent discount from parity with WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
