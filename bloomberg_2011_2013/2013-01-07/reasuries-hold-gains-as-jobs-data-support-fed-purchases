Treasury 10-year note yields were at
almost an eight-month high in before the first auction of the
securities this year on concern the  Federal Reserve  may wind
down debt purchases earlier than most investors anticipated.  Yields on the benchmark  securities  soared the most since
March last week after minutes from the Fed’s last meeting showed
policy makers differed over the scope of purchases and several
officials thought the Fed should end quantitative easing before
year-end. The U.S. is selling $66 billion of notes and bonds
this week, including $21 billion in 10-year debt in two days.  “The 10-year is relatively cheap on the curve -- it’s a
relative value play,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and
head of Treasury trading in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp.
“People are starting to get a sense that there’s a potential
for rates to move higher. We have been at crisis levels for
quite some time, with the Fed fueling those flames.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield was little changed at 1.90
percent as of 4:59 p.m.  New York  time, based on Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. It jumped to 1.97 percent on Jan. 4, the most
since April 26. The 1.625 percent note maturing in November 2022
added 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face value, to 97 18/32. The
notes yielded 1.91 percent in when-issued trading.  The  30-year bond  yielded 3.10 percent after reaching 3.18
percent on Jan. 4, the most since April 25, and yielded 3.11
percent in when-issued trading.  Yield Outlook  The U.S. debt auctions this week begin tomorrow with $32
billion in three-year notes and conclude Jan. 10 with $13
billion in 30-year bonds. The current three-year note yield was
little changed at 0.39 percent and at 0.41 percent in when-
issued trading.  “The auctions will go well at these levels,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT Capital Group
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We’re finding a footing in here.
We’ll probably get more of a concession.”  U.S. government securities traded today close to the least
expensive levels in eight months. The 10-year term premium, a
model created by economists at the Fed that includes
expectations for interest rates, growth and inflation, touched
negative 0.69 percent. It reached negative 0.68 percent on Jan.
3, the least costly since May.  A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value. The average
last year was negative 0.77 percent.  Forecasts Lowered  Economists cut their forecasts for Treasury yields in 2013
to the least since Bloomberg began compiling the predictions
after data last week showed the  unemployment rate  was higher
than expected. U.S. 10-year yields will rise to 2.14 percent by
Dec. 31, according to a Bloomberg survey of banks and securities
companies up to the end of last week.  The 10-year note yield touched the eight-month high Jan. 4
after the Labor Department said joblessness was 7.8 percent in
December, higher than economist projections, even as the economy
added 155,000 jobs. The employment figures tempered speculation
the Fed will stop buying bonds this year, a strategy to spur the
economy by putting downward pressure on benchmark interest
rates.  U.S. growth will average 1 percent in the first half of
2013 and that is not enough to lower the 7.8 percent
unemployment rate,  Bill Gross , co-chief investment officer at
 Newport Beach , California-based Pacific Investment Management
Co. wrote in a Twitter post today. Investors should buy five-
year Treasuries, he said. The five-year yield was unchanged at
0.81 percent.  ‘Stop Purchases’  Four years after cutting the benchmark  interest rate  to
virtually zero, Fed policy makers have expanded their third
round of quantitative easing, or QE3, to include $40 billion in
mortgage bonds and $45 billion in Treasuries. The central bank
purchased $1.47 billion of Treasuries maturing from February
2036 to November 2042 today.  In the first two rounds of QE, from 2008 to 2011, the
central bank bought $2.3 trillion in securities.  “Several” members of the policy-setting  Federal Open
Market Committee  said it would “probably be appropriate to slow
or stop purchases well before the end of 2013,” according to
minutes of their Dec. 11-12 meeting released last week.  Fed Focus  “We still have carry-over on the Fed question,
particularly in terms of overseas,” said  Jim Vogel , head of
agency-debt research at FTN Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee .
“We sense that other investors globally will remain focused on
Washington developments.”  Treasury  volume  dropped 54 percent to $185 billion as of
5:01 p.m. in New York, according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-
dealer broker of  U.S. government debt . Volume rose Jan. 4 to the
most in almost four months to $404 billion in New York, the most
since Sept. 13. Daily volume averaged $239 billion in 2012.  Volatility in Treasuries dropped today from near two-month
highs. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which
measures price swings of U.S. government securities based on
options, was at 60 basis points, down from 63.5 basis points
reached Jan. 3, the most since Nov. 6. The 2012 average was 69.8
basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
