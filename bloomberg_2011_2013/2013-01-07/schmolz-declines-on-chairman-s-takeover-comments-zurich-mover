Schmolz + Bickenbach AG (STLN)  fell the most
in more than two months after the steel-maker’s chairman, Hans- Peter Zehnder, told SonntagsZeitung he has no information on
possible takeover attempts by financial investors.  Schmolz declined as much as 9.2 percent, the biggest
intraday fall since Nov. 2, and traded 7.3 percent lower at 2.93
Swiss francs at 11:03 a.m. in Zurich. That tapered gains last
week after Handelsblatt reported that Schmolz may be sold in a
transaction valued at as much as 500 million euros ($652
million).  “It’s a combination of the chairman not knowing, plus
investors realizing that a takeover would be hugely dilutive to
the minority shareholders in the end,” Patrick Rafaisz, an
analyst at Bank Vontobel AG in Zurich, said by telephone. “If
anybody assumes the 43 percent stake from the family owners, it
would trigger an early redemption of Schmolz’s 258 million euros
of bonds which would require a capital increase, we believe,”
he said.  Schmolz sold the 9.875 percent, seven-year euro-notes in
May as slowing demand for steel in  Europe  pressured the
company’s finances. German steel executive Johannes Nonn, who
joins Schmolz from  Salzgitter AG (SZG) , will lead the company as Chief
Executive Officer from Feb. 1, replacing Benedikt Niemeyer, who
was fired in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
