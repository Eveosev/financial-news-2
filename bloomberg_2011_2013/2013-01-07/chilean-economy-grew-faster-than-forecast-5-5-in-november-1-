Chile´s economy grew 5.5 percent in
November from the year before, beating estimates made by
analysts on gains in the service, mining and retail industries.  The median estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for the economy, as measured by the Imacec index that is a
proxy for gross domestic product, to expand 5.2 percent in
November. The economy expanded 1.3 percent from the previous
month on a seasonally-adjusted basis, the central bank said in a
report posted on its website today.  Chile’s economy is expanding at two speeds, with retail
sales growth averaging 8.5 percent over the past year, while
industrial production gains 2.5 percent. Gains in  consumer
spending  pose a threat to economic stability if internal demand
doesn’t moderate this year as forecast, central bank President
Rodrigo Vergara said last month.  “Greater vigor of internal demand could generate
inflationary pressures,” he told senators Dec. 18 after
presenting quarterly forecasts. “Greater vigor of internal
demand also could widen the current account deficit.”  The two-speed economy was even more marked in November,
with retail sales surging 10.7 percent from the previous year,
while manufacturing expanded 0.8 percent, according to
government data published Dec. 28.  As demand expands and pulls in imports, the current account
gap will expand to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product this
year from an estimated 3.8 percent in 2012, policy makers said
in forecasts published Dec. 18. Chile’s trade surplus shrank to
$4.2 billion in all of 2012 from $10.8 billion in 2011,
according to a separate report published today by the central
bank.  Internal demand will expand 5.7 percent in 2013 after
climbing 6.6 percent in 2012 and 9.4 percent in 2011, according
to central bank forecasts.  The peso was little changed at 473.08 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:35 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
