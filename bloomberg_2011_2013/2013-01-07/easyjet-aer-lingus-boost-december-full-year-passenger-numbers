EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , Europe’s second-largest
low-cost airline, added 3.7 million passengers last year to take
the total to 59.2 million, narrowing the gap to market leader
 Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA)   EasyJet’s passenger tally increased 6.7 percent in the 12
months, outstripping growth of 4 percent at Dublin-based
Ryanair, which added 3.2 million customers for a total of 79.6
million, 20.4 million more than its Luton, England-based rival.  EasyJet Chief Executive Officer Carolyn McCall has boosted
frequencies on key routes while using allocated seats, flexible
tickets and corporate agents to grab a bigger slice of business
travel. The U.K. airline carried 4.34 million passengers in
December, it said in a statement, up 204,000 from a year
earlier, as Ryanair boosted its total by 80,000 to 4.7 million.  Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL) , Ireland’s No. 2 airline and subject
to a takeover bid from Ryanair, carried 9.65 million passengers
last year, up 1.5 percent from 2011. The December total jumped
by 734,000, or 7.2 percent, according to a statement.  EasyJet, whose stock added 79 percent last year, rose as
much as 2.8 percent and traded 2.4 percent higher at 840.50
pence as of 3:01 p.m. in  London . Ryanair, which advanced 30
percent in 2012, was priced up 2.1 percent at 5.05 euros.  EasyJet filled 88.9 percent of available seats, compared
with a load factor of 82 percent at Ryanair and almost 78
percent at Aer Lingus, which is also based in Dublin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
