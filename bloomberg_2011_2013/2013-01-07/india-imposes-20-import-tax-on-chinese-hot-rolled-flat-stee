India , the world’s third-largest
steel consumer, imposed a 20 percent tax on imports of some
varieties of the alloy from  China  to protect local producers.
The shares of  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  and its domestic rivals surged.  The duty on hot-rolled flat products of stainless steel
will last for 200 days, the customs department said in a Jan. 4
notification posted today on its website. The taxes will also
apply to steel products having a minimum nickel content of 6
percent and those containing chromium, with or without the
presence of other elements such as molybdenum and titanium, the
notice said.  Indian steelmakers are contending with imports as global
demand falters, prompting producers in China,  South Korea  and
Japan to tap overseas markets. Imports from April to November
surged 19.6 percent to more than 5 million metric tons, India’s
steel ministry said on Dec. 6.  “More and more countries are raising trade barriers amid
the weak global economy,” Li Xinchuang, president of China’s
Metallurgical Industry Planning & Research Institute, said by
phone. “I am quite concerned about this and don’t see any
reason why India should impose a 20 percent import tax,” said
Li, who is also a deputy general secretary of the China Iron &
Steel Association.  Shares of Tata Steel, the nation’s biggest producer, rose
as much as 3.4 percent to 448.10 rupees and traded at 438.40
rupees as of 3.27 p.m. in Mumbai.  Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) ,
the second-largest producer, rose as much as 6.8 percent to
101.75 rupees, while  JSW Steel Ltd. (JSTL) , the third-biggest, jumped
as much as 4.7 percent to 866.40 rupees.  Last year, China exported about 45,000 tons of hot-rolled
stainless flat steel to India, or 5.4 percent of China’s global
shipment of the product, worth about $134 million, said Xu
Xiangchun, Beijing-based chief analyst with researcher
Mysteel.com.  “It’s quite a small amount to affect Chinese producers,”
Xu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
