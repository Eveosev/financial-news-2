Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s Warner Bros.
studio created an animation venture with a goal of releasing one
feature film a year, as it competes with  DreamWorks Animation
SKG Inc. (DWA)  and Pixar owner Walt Disney Co.  Filmmakers will work together and individually on projects
including the venture’s first picture, the 3-D “The LEGO
Movie,” scheduled for release next year, the Burbank,
California-based studio said today in a statement.  The new unit will make animation a regular part of the
annual production slate at the studio, which produced  “Happy
Feet” films about a colony of penguins.  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s Paramount
Pictures added an animation unit in 2011, for more product in a
marketplace once dominated by Pixar and DreamWorks Animation.  Five of the top 15 movies in the U.S. and  Canada  last year
were animated features, according to researcher Box Office Mojo.
“Ice Age: Continental Drift,” which collected $875 million in
worldwide sales for  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Twentieth Century Fox, was the
top grossing animation movie globally.  At Warner, animated features development will be overseen
by Courtenay Valenti, Chris deFaria and Greg Silverman, the
studio said. The studio also will look to partner with
established animation studios for production of the films.  Time Warner  fell  0.5 percent to $49.12 at the close in New
York. The shares gained 32 percent last year.  “The LEGO Movie,” directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller
from their own screenplay, is scheduled to open Feb. 7, 2014,
according to the studio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
