China , the world’s biggest supplier
of rare-earths, set the first of two production quotas for 2013
at 46,900 metric tons of the ore that is refined for use in
mobile phones, hybrid cars and missile systems.  The figure is about half the total quota set last year,
according to a Ministry of Land and Resources statement posted
on its  website  on Jan 5. The ministry didn’t make public the
production quotas last year, while the figure in 2011 was 93,800
tons.  Output quotas for the rest of the year will be announced in
the second quarter, according to the statement.  China also set a production quota for tungsten concentrate
at 43,500 tons and antimony ore at 37,680 tons, according to the
statement, which gave no comparison with previous years.  Since 2007, China has imposed production limits on rare
earths and set export restrictions to preserve supply and
conserve the environment. The curbs raised trade disputes with
the world’s major users, including the U.S. and  Japan .  Rare earths are a group of 17 chemically similar elements
gaining increasing usage in the shift to cleaner energy sources,
such as magnets in wind turbines, hybrid vehicle batteries and
catalysts to reduce automobile exhaust emissions.  China, which provides about 95 percent of global rare earth
shipments, also cut the first-lot export quota by 27 percent to
15,501 tons from that of 2012, according to a statement by the
Ministry of Commerce on Dec. 28.  Demand for some China rare earths has declined as companies
such as Toyota Motor Corp. and  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  to recycle the
metals and employ substitutes. In November, Japan, the world’s
biggest importer of rare earths, signed an agreement to buy more
of the metals from  India  to diversify supply.  Praseodymium-neodymium oxid e, a light rare-earth product,
traded at 285,000  yuan  ($45,756) a ton on Jan. 4 in  Shanghai ,
according to researcher Shanghai Steelhome Information. Prices
have tumbled 78 percent from a record 1.28 million yuan set in
June 2011.  For Related News and Information:
