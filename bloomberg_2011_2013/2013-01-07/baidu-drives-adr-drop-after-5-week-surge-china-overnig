Chinese equities  fell in New York,
led by  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  and solar stocks, on speculation a five-week
rally in the benchmark index of U.S.-traded shares is overdone.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 0.9 percent to 100.77
yesterday, the biggest slide in two weeks. Baidu, owner of
China’s most-used web search engine, dropped the most in a month
after Barclays Plc cut its rating on the stock, while  Suntech
Power Holdings Co. (STP)  fell the most since October 2011. Oil
producer  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  slid to trade at the widest  discount  to its
Hong Kong shares in eight days.  The China-US gauge surged 5.1 percent  last week , the
steepest advance since September and extending the longest
stretch of weekly rallies since February, as manufacturing data
added to signs the world’s second-largest economy is emerging
from its slowdown and U.S. lawmakers reached a budget deal.
China’s CSI 300 Index of mainland-traded stocks entered a  bull
market  yesterday, after gaining 20 percent from its 2012 low.  “It’s unrealistic to expect the stocks to continue to go
along as far as they have,” Mark Luschini, the chief investment
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages $54
billion in assets including Chinese equities, said in a phone
interview from Philadelphia yesterday. “Chinese equities are
poised to move higher over the course of the upcoming year. This
is not going to be a linear progression at this annualized pace
like what we’ve seen in the past few weeks.”  ETF Slips  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the largest Chinese
ETF in the U.S., sank 0.8 percent to $41.29 in New York
yesterday, after jumping 5.2 percent last week. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slipped 0.3 percent to 1,461.89, paring last
week’s 4.6 percent advance, as investors waited for the start of
the U.S. company earnings season.  Baidu dropped 2.3 percent yesterday to $102.29 in New York,
the biggest slump since Dec. 5. The Beijing-based company’s
smaller competitor,  Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU) , climbed 2.6
percent in a sixth day of gains to $32.49, the highest level
since April 2011.  Barclays analyst Alicia Yap cut her recommendation on Baidu
to equal-weight, the equivalent of hold, from overweight
yesterday, and reduced the price target by 18 percent to $113,
according to a client note. Gains in Baidu’s shares will be
limited by risks to its earnings, a lack of clarity on its
mobile Internet strategies, and Qihoo’s monetization of its
search traffic, Yap wrote.  Suntech, LDK  Echo He, a senior analyst at Maxim Group LLC, raised her
price estimate for Qihoo by 32 percent to $37 yesterday, saying
the Beijing-based company’s advertising partnership with Google
Inc. will boost revenue in the first quarter. She maintained a
buy rating on Qihoo’s American depositary receipts.  Suntech, the world’s largest solar maker, tumbled 21
percent to $1.48 in New York, the biggest decline since Oct. 3,
2011. The Jiangsu, China-based company’s ADRs rallied 34 percent
last week, the steepest weekly gain since October 2011, after
the Chinese government announced measures to boost domestic
demand for solar energy. Trading volume on the ADRs was more
than five times daily average over the past three months,
Bloomberg data showed.  LDK Solar Co. (LDK)  retreated 11 percent to $1.9, while  Yingli
Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  sank 6.8 percent to $2.61.  Trina Solar
Ltd. (TSL)  lost 4.3 percent to $4.71.  China’s biggest solar manufacturers accumulated total debt
of $17.5 billion by the end of third quarter, Taipei-based
Digitimes  reported  yesterday, citing its research data.
“Despite having government support, it is difficult to turn the
situation around quickly,” according to the report.  Dangdang Gains  Cnooc, China’s biggest offshore oil explorer, dropped 2.2
percent to $219.95 yesterday, the biggest loss since Nov. 7. The
producer’s ADRs, each representing 100 underlying shares, traded
0.5 percent below its stock in  Hong Kong , the widest discount
since Dec. 24.  New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (EDU) , the
nation’s biggest private educational company, slid 2.5 percent
to $19.5, the biggest slump in a month.  Beijing-based New Oriental is scheduled to report earnings
on Jan. 29 for the three months ended Nov. 30. The company may
report net loss of $6.46 million, according to the average
estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be
the  first quarterly loss  since the quarter ended May 31, 2007.
Analysts’ sales projection of $166 million compared with the
company’s forecast of as much as $171.6 million given in
October.  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) , the nation’s largest online
book retailer, advanced 6.8 percent to $4.69, the highest price
since Nov. 28.  Youku Tudou Inc. (YOKU) , owner of China’s most-popular
video websites, increased 4.4 percent to $20.34,  the highest
level since Oct. 25.  Melco Advances  ABR Investment Strategy LLC yesterday gave Youku a new
rating, equivalent to buy, and set a price target of $24.  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL) , the Macau casino operator,
jumped 5.8 percent to $19.25 yesterday, the highest level since
February 2007. Its ADRs traded 2.8 percent above Hong Kong
shares, reversing discounts in the previous two days.  Gaming revenue in Macau may rise 18 percent this month from
a year earlier to about 29.5 billion patacas ($3.7 billion),
 David Bain , an analyst at Sterne Agee Group Inc., wrote in a
note yesterday. That was up from his previous estimate of 15
percent growth, and may exceed a monthly record of 28.2 billion
patacas in December, he said.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese shares
added 0.4 percent to 2,285.36 yesterday, closing at the highest
level since June 20. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
advanced 0.3 percent to 11,937.07, after climbing 4.9 percent
last week.  ‘More Money’  The Chinese economy is poised to grow 8.1 percent this
year, from 7.7 percent in 2012, according to the median
estimates of 49 economists surveyed last month by Bloomberg. The
world’s second-largest economy is capable of growing in excess
of 8 percent annually over the next 20 years should the nation
undertake reforms, Lin Yifu, a former World Bank chief
economist, said at a conference yesterday at the New York Stock
Exchange.  China’s CSI 300 Index, which tracks 300 yuan-denominated A
shares traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen, gained 0.5 percent to
2,535.99 yesterday. The index has rebounded 20 percent since
hitting a near four-year low Dec. 3, signaling a bull market.  “China is going to look good this year because they are
doing all they can to revive the A market,”  Mark Mobius , who
oversees more than $40 billion at Templeton Emerging Markets
Group, said in an interview in  Kuala Lumpur  yesterday.  “As the Chinese government opens up, you’re going to see
more money going into the A from foreigners.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
