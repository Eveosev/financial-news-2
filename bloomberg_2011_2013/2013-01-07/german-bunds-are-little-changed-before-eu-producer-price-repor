Italian and Spanish 10-year
 government bonds  declined for a second day before the nations
hold their first debt sales of the year later this week.  Italian  yields  rose following their biggest weekly decline
since November, as former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi 
renewed his political partnership with the  Northern League 
before a general election next month. German 10-year bonds
advanced for the first time in four days as a report showed
euro-area producer-price  inflation  slowed more than economists
estimated in November.  “The market is making room for more supply,” said Elwin de Groot, a market economist at Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht,
the Netherlands. “Investors are also assessing the political
situation in  Italy . There’s still a lot of uncertainty ahead and
they are judging if the spreads adequately compensate them for
political risks.”  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds climbed nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 4.35 percent at 4:45 p.m.
 London  time. The 5.50 percent bond maturing in November 2022
fell 0.705, or 7.05 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,310) face amount,
to 109.475. The rate dropped 23 basis points last week, the most
since the period ended Nov. 30.  Spanish 10-year bond yields climbed six basis points to
5.11 percent.  Spain  will sell securities due between 2015 and
2026 on Jan. 10. Italy may announce details of its Jan. 11
auction tomorrow.  Berlusconi Agreement  Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party reached an agreement
with the Northern League to run together in February elections,
he said today on RTL radio. While the coalition’s campaign will
be led by Berlusconi, the premiership would be determined after
the vote and he would consider serving as finance minister, he
said. The League, which served in all three of Berlusconi’s
governments, opposed his candidacy for premier.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti  was appointed in November 2011
after Berlusconi’s last government unraveled at a time when 10-
year bond yields topped 7 percent. The yield difference with
German bonds has narrowed to 280 basis points today, from the
euro-era record of 575 basis points on Nov. 9, 2011.  Italian debt maturing in a year or more gained 1.3 percent
this month through Jan. 4, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish bonds returned 1.4 percent and German
securities lost 1.4 percent.  Germany’s  10-year bund  yield fell two basis points to 1.52
percent. The yield on 10-year French securities dropped three
basis points to 2.11 percent.  France  sold six-month bills today to yield zero percent,
compared with the previous auction yield of minus 0.003 percent
on Jan. 2.  Break-even Rates  Factory-gate prices in the 17-nation euro region rose 2.1
percent from a year earlier after a 2.6 percent increase in
October, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today. Economists had forecast an increase of 2.4 percent,
the median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  “Despite some improvement in recent flows of data in the
 euro zone , the overall economy remains weak,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London.
“Demand for the safest assets will not evaporate given there
are still question marks out there on a number of issues.”  Germany’s 10-year break-even rate stayed higher after the
producer-price data. The gauge of market inflation expectations
derived from the yield gap between government bonds and index-
linked securities, rose one basis point to 1.75 percentage
points. The average in the past five year is 1.77 percentage
points.  Core Bonds  Other so-called core bonds including those issued by
 Finland , the Netherlands and  Austria  advanced before European
Central Bank policy makers meet on Jan. 10. Even as politicians
and economists brace for recession, only five out of 55
economists in a Bloomberg News survey expect an interest-rate
cut at the meeting. The yield on 10-year Austrian debt declined
four basis points to 1.88 percent.  Volatility on Austrian bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by those of Italy, according to measures
of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread between two-
and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  The central bank will keep the key rate unchanged at a
record low of 0.75 percent until at least the first quarter of
2014, a separate survey showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
