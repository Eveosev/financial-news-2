India ’s rupee fell to the weakest
level in more than a month on concern a record current account
deficit will pressure the currency.  The widest measure of trade was $22.3 billion in the
quarter ended Sept. 30, according to central bank data published
on Dec. 31. The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  of shares fell for the
first time in five days.  “The current account deficit will continue to require
plenty in the way of foreign direct investment and portfolio
inflows to produce a balance of payments surplus and
appreciation pressure on the rupee,” Robert-Prior Wandesforde,
a Singapore-based economist at Credit Suisse AG wrote in a
research note today. “In short, we find it hard to be
structurally optimistic about the currency.”  The rupee declined 0.3 percent to 55.2250 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier
touched 55.3350 per dollar, the weakest level since Nov. 29.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, fell 10 basis points, or
0.10 percentage point, to 9.70 percent.  Credit Suisse predicts the rupee will decline to 56.5 per
dollar by the end of 2013.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.20 per
dollar, compared with 56.05 on Jan. 4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 56.19 versus 56.01. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
