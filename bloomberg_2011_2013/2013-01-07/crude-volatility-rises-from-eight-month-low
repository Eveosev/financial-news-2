Oil options volatility rose from an
eight-month low as the underlying futures increased.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 21.01 percent at 5:10 p.m. on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange, up from 20.6 on Jan. 4, the lowest
level since May 2.  Crude oil for February delivery rose 10 cents to $93.19 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since Sept. 18. Prices are down 8.2 percent from a
year ago.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
February $100 calls, which declined 4 cents to 6 cents a barrel
at 5:30 p.m. on volume of 1,798 contracts. The second-most
active, with 1,178 lots exchanged, were February $95 calls, down
10 cents to 51 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 55
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 55 percent of
volume.  June $75 puts were the most active options yesterday, with
3,544 contracts trading as they fell 3 cents to 94 cents a
barrel. February $90 puts slipped 16 cents to 46 cents a barrel
on 3,436 lots.  Open interest was highest for February $105 calls with
