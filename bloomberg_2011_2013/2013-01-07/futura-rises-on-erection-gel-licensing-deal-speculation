Futura Medical Plc (FUM)  rose the most in
almost two months on speculation that it will announce a
licensing agreement on its erection-enhancing product.  Futura rose 11 percent to close at 70.5 pence in London
trading, the biggest gain since Nov. 13. The price is the
highest since July 12 and gives the Guildford, England-based
company a market value of 54.6 million pounds ($87.8 million).  The company is seeking a new partner for CSD500, a gel used
inside a condom, after talks with  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/) 
collapsed in August. Investors may be anticipating an
announcement “over the next quarter,” Chief Executive Officer
James Barder said in an interview. He declined to specify when
the company might complete a deal.  “We are pleased about the progress being made,” Barder
said today by telephone. “We’ve had a lot of interest, and
those discussions are progressing.”  Approval of the CE Mark needed to sell CSD500 in  Europe  is
also “on track,” the company said in a statement today. While
the board is confident of licensing the product, there is no
guarantee of a deal or that the terms will reflect management’s
expectations of the produt’s value, Futura said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
