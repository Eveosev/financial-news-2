Vitol Group bid unsuccessfully for
two cargoes of  North Sea  Forties crude, one of which was at the
same price as a trade in the previous session. Statoil ASA
didn’t find a buyer for a consignment of Oseberg.  Daily exports of North Sea Brent, Forties, Oseberg and
Ekofisk crudes, which make up the Dated Brent benchmark, will
rise in February to the most in nine months, loading programs
obtained by Bloomberg News show.  North Sea  Vitol failed to find a seller for a Forties cargo loading
Jan. 23 to Jan. 26 at $1.50 a barrel more than Dated Brent and
also for a Jan. 28 to Feb. 3 lot at plus $1.30, a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window showed. That compares with a Jan. 21 to Jan. 23 shipment
it bought at $1.50 more than the benchmark on Jan. 4.  Statoil ASA failed to find a buyer for Oseberg lot 20130104
for loading from Jan. 21 to Jan. 23 at $1.80 more than Dated
Brent, according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose to $1.49 more than Dated Brent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. That compares with a $1.42 premium in the
previous session and is the most since March 12.  Brent for February settlement traded at $111.24 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $111.28 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $110.16, a discount of $1.08 to February.  BFOE exports next month will be 942,857 barrels a day
compared with 812,903 barrels in January, according to the
plans. That’s the most since May when loadings totaled 956,452
barrels a day.  Forties shipments is set to increase by 24 percent in
February to 407,143 barrels a day. Oseberg will rise by 10.7
percent to 128,571 barrels while Ekofisk will gain 20 percent to
278,571 barrels. Brent is set to fall 5.1 percent to 128,571
barrels a day.  Exports of Troll grade will drop by three cargoes to 11
lots next month, while Alvheim shipments will fall to four lots
and Foinaven to one, separate loading programs obtained by
 Bloomberg News  showed. Grane and Aasgard will be stable at four
consignments and six, respectively.  Shipments of Gullfaks will rise to six lots while Statfjord
will increase to five cargoes, according to separate schedules.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals crude for a
third day, according to the Platts survey.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
was at minus 85 cents, 8 cents narrower than on Jan. 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest Europe,
the  discount  decreased to $1.25 from $1.29 in the previous
session, the data showed.  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil company, bought 100,000
tons of Urals from OAO Lukoil’s Litasco unit, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  Orlen purchased the Jan. 21 to Jan. 25 cargo for loading
from Primorsk port in the Baltics, the people said asking not to
be identified because the information is confidential.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend dropped 3 cents to $2.38
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bharat Petroleum Corp.,  India ’s second-biggest state
refiner, is seeking to buy crude for loading either in February
or March, according to a tender obtained by Bloomberg News.  Loading is either from Feb. 24 to Feb. 28 or from March 1
to March 10, the document showed. The tender closes Jan. 15 at 3
p.m. local time with offers valid until 7 p.m. the next day.  Libya ’s state-run National Oil Corp. kept its official
selling price of benchmark Es Sider crude for January unchanged
at parity to Dated Brent, according to a price list obtained by
