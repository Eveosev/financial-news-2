The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an
appeal by  Retractable Technologies Inc. (RVP)  in its patent suit
against  Becton, Dickinson & Co. (BDX)  over technology used to protect
health-care workers from accidental needle sticks.  Retractable was seeking to overturn a federal appeals court
decision that struck down part of a $5 million jury award.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in
July that Becton’s 3-milliliter Integra syringe doesn’t violate
Retractable’s patents. The appeals court upheld the jury’s
separate finding against Becton over its 1-milliliter Integra
product. The patents cover Retractable’s VanishPoint-brand
syringes, which contain spring-loaded needles.  Retractable, based in Little Elm, Texas, is also pressing
an antitrust case against Becton, based in Franklin Lakes, New
Jersey.  The case is Retractable Technologies v. Becton Dickinson,
11-1154.  To contact the reporter on this story:
