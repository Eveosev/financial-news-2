Brazil â€™s swap rates climbed as
economists raised their forecasts for inflation in 2013,
spurring speculation that the central bank will increase
borrowing costs from record lows.  Swap rates on contracts due in January 2016 increased one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.21 percent at 10:26
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real rose less than 0.1 percent to 2.0318
per U.S. dollar, the strongest level on a closing basis since
Nov. 1.  About 100 economists in a weekly central bank survey
published today raised their median inflation forecast for the
end of 2013 to 5.49 percent from 5.47 percent the week before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
