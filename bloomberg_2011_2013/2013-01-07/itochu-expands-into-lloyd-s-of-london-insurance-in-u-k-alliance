Itochu Corp. (8001) , which seeks to become
the most profitable Japanese trading house outside of mineral
resources, said it formed an alliance with  Antares (ANT)  Managing
Agency Ltd. of the U.K. to expand in the  insurance industry .  The alliance with London-based Antares will allow Itochu to
be Japan’s first non-financial company to underwrite risk in
Lloyd’s of London, the world’s largest insurance market, the
Tokyo-based company said today in a statement. Itochu will offer
reinsurance services, the company said.  “Through the alliance with Antares, Itochu will acquire
insurance underwriting techniques as well as know-how and
expertise in sales, facilitating the full launch and expansion
of its insurance underwriting business,” Itochu said.  Itochu Chief Executive Officer Masahiro Okafuji vowed last
year to make the trading house’s profit less dependent on sales
of iron ore, coal and energy as China’s industrial growth eases.
Itochu, which in September agreed to buy  Dole Food Co. (DOLE) ’s
packaged food and Asian fresh produce units for $1.69 billion,
earned  35 percent of its profit  from metal and energy sales in
the quarter ending Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
