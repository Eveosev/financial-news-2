The naira depreciated for a second
day as demand for dollars increased after the end of Christmas
and New Year festivities.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer weakened 0.2
percent to 157.0375 a dollar by 2:47 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency lost 0.4 percent last week.  “We expect to see a build-up in demand for foreign
exchange as businesses resume” operations, analysts at Lagos-
based Cowry Asset Management Ltd., led by Edgar Ebinum, said
today in an e-mailed note. “We expect to see pressure on the
naira.”  The Central Bank of Nigeria, which sells dollars to lenders
to stabilize the naira, resumed twice-weekly foreign-currency
auctions today after a break since Dec. 19. It sold $150
million, compared with $300 million disbursed at the previous
sale, it said in an e-mailed statement.  Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 slid two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
3.906 percent. The rate on 10-year naira debt fell 15 basis
points to 11.52 percent, according to Jan. 4 prices compiled on
the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.  Central bank policy makers left the benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 12 percent last year. Nigeria’s  inflation  rate rose
for a second month in November to 12.3 percent from 11.7
percent, the  National Bureau of Statistics  said Dec. 17.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.1 percent to 1.8975 per dollar in
Accra, the capital. It depreciated 16 percent last year, the
most since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
