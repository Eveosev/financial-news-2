Canada’s Ivey purchasing managers’
index rose for the first time in five months in December, with
the survey also suggesting hiring prospects are dimming.  The index climbed to 52.8 on a seasonally adjusted basis
from November’s 47.5, according to a statement on the website of
Western University’s business school in  London , Ontario.
Readings of more than 50 indicate purchasing by governments and
companies advanced. Economists  forecast  a reading of 49.8.  Three of the report’s four  sub-categories  suggested
weakening activity, including a decline in the employment
measure to 49.2 from 55.1 and a drop in the inventory index to
42.4 from 55.6.  The report adds to evidence of a modest economic rebound at
the end of last year after output growth slowed to a 0.6 percent
annual pace in the third quarter. The country’s unemployment
fell to a four-year low of 7.1 percent in December while
inflation slipped to 0.8 percent, below the central bank’s
target range.  “The wider economic backdrop remains subdued,” said  David Tulk , chief Canada macro strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s
TD Securities unit.  Ivey’s supplier delivery measure was little changed at 47.8
in December. The price reading fell to 61.3 from 62.9, with the
figure greater than 50 showing that prices rose on the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
