 Shanghai  climbed for a fourth day to the highest in almost six
months as mills raised their product prices amid rising demand
and raw material prices.  Rebar for delivery in May gained as much as 1.4 percent to
4,047 yuan ($649) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
the highest since July 10, 2012, before trading at 4,013 at
11:31 a.m. Futures advanced 1.9 percent last week for a fifth
weekly gain, the best run since March.  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) ,  China ’s largest steelmaker, will

by 120  yuan  per ton. Jiangsu Shagang Co. also raised its rebar
steel prices by 150 yuan a ton on Jan. 1, according to Shenyin
Wanguo Futures Co.  “Mills are raising prices as traders continued to boost

advancing,” according to a report by Shanghai-based Shenyin
Wanguo Futures today. “Sentiment is also buoyed by the
generally higher real estate prices.”  Rebar surged 14 percent in December, the most since July

government increased infrastructure spending and accelerated
