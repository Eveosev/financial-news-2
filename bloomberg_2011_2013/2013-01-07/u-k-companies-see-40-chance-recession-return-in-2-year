U.K. companies see a 40 percent
chance that the British economy will return to recession within
two years, according to a Deloitte LLP survey of chief financial
officers.  That’s a decline from 43 percent in the third quarter and
47 percent in the second, the financial advisor said in a report
published today.  Of the 112 companies surveyed, a net 81 percent said the
government’s monetary policy stance is appropriate. Only 4
percent of respondents said the cost and difficulty of raising
finance was a major worry for their businesses.  “The emerging picture is of businesses which are
constrained by low growth and uncertainty rather than weakness
in business models or access to capital,” said  Ian Stewart ,
Deloitte’s chief economist for the U.K.  The executives said the chance of the euro-area breaking up
within a year is 22 percent, compared with 37 percent a year
earlier. The survey was taken from Nov. 25 to Dec. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
