The Buffalo Bills hired Doug Marrone
of Syracuse University to become the next coach of the National
Football League team.  Marrone succeeds Chan Gailey, who was fired Dec. 31 after
going 16-32 over three seasons, the team announced today in an
e-mailed release. The Bills haven’t had a winning record since
2004 and have missed the playoffs for 13 straight years, the
longest active streak in the NFL.  It is the first NFL head coaching job for Marrone, 48, who
went 25-25 in four seasons at Syracuse, including an 8-5 mark
this season and a victory over West Virginia in the Pinstripe
Bowl. The Orange were 26-57 in the seven years prior to his
arrival, according to ESPN.  Marrone was offensive line coach for the  New York  Jets from
2002 to 2005 and offensive coordinator for the New Orleans
Saints from 2006 to 2008. In 2006 and 2008, the Saints led the
NFL in total yards and passing yards per game, the release said.  A native of New York City’s Bronx borough and a former
Syracuse offensive lineman, Marrone was picked in the sixth
round of the 1986 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Raiders. He has
also coached in college at Tennessee, Georgia and Georgia Tech.  To contact the reporters on this story:
