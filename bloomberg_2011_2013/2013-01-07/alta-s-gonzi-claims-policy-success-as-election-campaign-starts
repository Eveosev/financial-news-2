Malta’s Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi
said that his government protected the country from the fallout
of the  European debt crisis  as he started his campaign for the
March 9 elections.  “The people have a clear choice to make that should be
based on information, and not gimmicks,” Gonzi told reporters
today in Valletta after President George Abela dissolved the
Parliament paving the way for the March 9 vote. “It was thanks
to our policies directed at saving jobs that around 5,000
factory jobs were saved and so was the livelihood of so many
families safeguarded.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
