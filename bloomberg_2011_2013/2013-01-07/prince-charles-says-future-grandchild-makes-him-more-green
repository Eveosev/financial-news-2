Prince Charles, the heir to the
British throne, said the prospect of becoming a grandfather has
made him more determined to pursue his environmental concerns.  The Duchess of Cambridge, the former  Kate Middleton , and
her husband  Prince William , Charles’s elder son, are expecting
their first child, who will be third in line to the throne. The
Duchess, 30, is due to give birth in early summer.  Charles, the eldest son of  Queen Elizabeth II , is known by
his official title of  Prince of Wales . He has long been an
advocate of environmental causes. In 2007 he set up the  Prince’s
Rainforests Project  to tackle over-logging.  “I’ve gone on for years about the importance of thinking
about the long term in relation to environmental damage, climate
change and everything else,” the prince, 64, told ITV’s “This
Morning” show. “We don’t, in a sensible world, want to hand on
an increasingly dysfunctional world to our grandchildren, to
leave them with the real problem. I don’t want to be confronted
by my future grandchild and have them say, ‘Why didn’t you do
something?’”  Charles also said he worries every night about his younger
son Prince Harry, 28, who is serving with British troops in
 Afghanistan  as an Apache helicopter pilot.  “If you are a parent or relation to a loved one and that
person is away in incredibly dangerous and challenging
circumstances, I know you worry all the time,” he said.
“Certainly every night I worry. But he loves what he is doing
and he’s brilliant at it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
