Taiwan’s shares fell the most among
 Asia ’s equity markets, led by the nation’s biggest flat-panel
companies.  Innolux Corp. (3481) , the largest liquid-crystal display maker on
the island, dropped 4.2 percent. AU Optronics Corp., the second
biggest, declined 3.3 percent. Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd.
decreased 1 percent.  The Taiex index retreated 0.6 percent to 7,760.40 at 11:47
a.m. local time, poised for the biggest drop since Dec. 21. The
benchmark measure has gained 9.5 percent from its Nov. 21 low.  “There’s some profit-taking after we rose for a while and
the index is being dragged down by the LCD makers as well,”
said Sam Hsieh, a Taipei-based  fund manager  at Fuh Hwa
Securities Investment Trust Co., who helps oversee the
equivalent of $7.8 billion. “There are no new drivers so
investors are taking a break. Still, the Taiex should gain this
year as the global economy is recovering.”  U.S. payrolls rose by 155,000 workers last month following
a revised 161,000 advance in November, which was more than
initially estimated. The median estimate of 82 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for an increase of 152,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
