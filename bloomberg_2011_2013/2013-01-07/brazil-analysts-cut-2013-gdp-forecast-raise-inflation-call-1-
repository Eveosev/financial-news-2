Analysts covering  Brazil  lowered
their forecast for growth this year and raised it for inflation,
as the world’s second-biggest emerging market struggles to
rebound from a slowdown that has lasted more than a year.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 3.26 percent
this year, according to the median estimate in a central bank
survey of about 100 analysts published today, down from 3.3
percent the previous week. Inflation this year will reach 5.49
percent, up from the previous week’s estimate of 5.47 percent.
Economists also boosted their 2012 inflation forecast for the
fifth straight week to 5.73 percent from the previous estimate
of 5.71 percent, the survey showed.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has injected a
series of stimuli into Brazil’s $2.5 trillion economy, which
economists forecast will grow this year the slowest among the
BRIC group, which includes Russia, India and  China . Meanwhile
the central bank has cut the benchmark Selic rate by 525 basis
points, the most of any Group of 20 nation, to a record 7.25
percent.  Economists in the survey maintained their estimate that
gross domestic product grew 0.98 percent in 2012, its worst
performance since 2009. The economy grew 2.7 percent and 7.5
percent in 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said on Dec. 27
that the economy will grow 3 percent to 4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
