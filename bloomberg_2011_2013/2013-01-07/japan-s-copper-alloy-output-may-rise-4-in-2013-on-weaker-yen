Japan ’s output of copper and copper-
alloy fabricated products may increase about 4 percent in 2013,
rising for the first time in three years on the nation’s effort
to revive its economy and to weaken the yen.  Production, including sheets and tubes, is estimated to
reach slightly over 800,000 metric tons in calendar 2013, Tetsu
Takahashi, chairman of the Japan Copper & Brass  Association ,
said today in  Tokyo . The country’s output may total about
770,000 tons in 2012, the second straight yearly drop and the
lowest level since 2009, he said.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed in a New Year
message to focus his newly appointed Cabinet’s efforts on
reviving the country’s economy, which has shrunk almost 10
percent over the past half-decade. The Japanese currency in 2012
had its biggest annual decline in seven years, after reaching a
postwar high in 2011 that eroded the competitiveness of the
country’s exporters.  “We expect some support for demand in 2013 from the new
government’s effort to rebuild after the 2011 earthquake and the
weaker yen as well as a recovery in Japanese car sales in
 China ,” said Takahashi, who is also vice president of Kobe
Steel Ltd. An increase in sales of tablet computers reduced
demand for copper-alloy products last year, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
