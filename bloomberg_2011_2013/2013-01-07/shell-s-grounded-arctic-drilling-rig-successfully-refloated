Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and a salvage
crew refloated an Arctic drilling rig that ran aground in  Alaska 
and towed it to a safe harbor.  The Kulluk, which broke free from a tow boat during a storm
on Dec. 31, was refloated off Sitkalidak Island at about 10:10
p.m. Alaska time last night, the Unified Command said in a
 statement  today. A tug towed it about 52 miles (84 kilometers)
to Kiliuda Bay for more tests, according to a subsequent
 statement .  The rig had grounded about 60 miles southwest of Kodiak,
Alaska, the latest setback in Shell’s almost $5 billion effort
to tap Arctic oil. Environmental groups said Jan. 3 they would
ask President  Barack Obama  to suspend all current and pending
Arctic drilling permits until operators prove they can work
safely in the region’s harsh conditions.  The Unified Command includes the U.S. Coast Guard, Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation, Kodiak Island Borough
and Shell. As much as 143,000 gallons of diesel and about 12,000
gallons of other refined oil products are currently stored on
board the Kulluk, according to the command website.  No fuel spill has been detected, according to the latest
command statement.  There are more than 730 people involved in the rig
recovery. The vessel is attached to the MV Aiviq by tow line,
the command said. Three additional tugs are on standby along
with the Coast Guard Cutter Alex Haley and two oil spill
response vessels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
