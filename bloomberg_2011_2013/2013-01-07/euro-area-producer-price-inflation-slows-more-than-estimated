Euro-area  producer-price inflation 
slowed more than economists estimated in November as easing
energy-cost growth offset higher prices for intermediate and
capital goods.  Factory-gate prices  in the 17-nation euro region rose 2.1
percent from a year earlier after a 2.6 percent increase in
October, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today. Economists had forecast an increase of 2.4 percent,
the median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.
From the prior month, prices fell 0.2 percent.  Energy costs on the producer level rose an annual 4.1
percent in November after a 5.9 percent increase in the previous
month, the statistics office said. Prices of intermediate goods
rose 1.4 percent after a 1.2 percent increase in October, while
capital goods were up 1 percent.  In  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, producer prices rose
1.4 percent from a year earlier, after increasing 1.5 percent in
the previous month, today’s data showed. France reported a gain
of 1.9 percent, with prices in Spain and Portugal increasing 2.8
percent and 3.8 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
