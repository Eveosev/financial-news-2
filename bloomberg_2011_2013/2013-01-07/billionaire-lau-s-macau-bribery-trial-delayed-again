Hong Kong billionaire Joseph Lau’s
bribery and money-laundering trial in Macau was delayed for a
second time after his lawyer told the court the chairman of Hong
Kong-listed  Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd. (127)  is ill.  Judge Mario Silvestre said he would set a date for the
trial to begin after receiving more details of the illness.
Silvestre replaced Alice Costa, whose illness delayed the
previous scheduled start of the trial in September.  Prosecutors accuse Lau of bribery and money laundering in
relation to the acquisition of land in Macau, Chinese Estates
said last year. Lau, who  controls  almost 75 percent of the
HK$23.6 billion ($3 billion) developer, has denied allegations
that he or his company might have given bribes to Ao Man-long,
Macau’s former secretary of transportation and public works, who
was sentenced to 29 years in prison in May.  The Macau government had invalidated the land concession
for the sites being developed by Chinese Estates into the La
Scala, a luxury residential project, the company said in an Aug.
15 filing. The sites were granted to Moon Ocean, a business
subsequently acquired by Chinese Estates, while Ao was still in
office, according to a separate filing.  The case is CR1-12-0131-PCC in Macau’s Court of First
Instance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
