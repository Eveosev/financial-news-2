The Phoenix Suns were so confident
that fans would enjoy their Dec. 6 game that they offered a
money-back guarantee. They were mostly right.  The National Basketball Association team received 365
refund demands, about 2 percent of that night’s attendance and
“well below” what management had built in as an estimate, club
spokesman Casey Taggatz said.  “As a whole, the results have been overwhelmingly
successful,” Taggatz wrote in an e-mail,  The Suns (12-23) drew 17,517 fans for their  money-back  game
against the  Dallas Mavericks , about 2,700 more than the club’s
previous season average. The 97-94 loss was Phoenix’s highest-
attended game of the season.  In addition, concession revenue for the money-back night
was up 21 percent over the average of previous games, Taggatz
said without providing specific figures.  Requests for refunds had to be postmarked by Dec. 31.  The Suns, who are averaging 14,697 this season -- sixth-
worst in the NBA -- didn’t say whether there would be another
money-back guarantee game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
