Gold’s 12-year bull market is over as
U.S. economic growth means investors will switch focus to
precious metals that benefit from expansion, the top forecaster
in the London Bullion Market Association’s 2012 poll said.  Prices will average $1,600 an ounce this year, down from a
record $1,668.75 last year, Rene Hochreiter, a director and
chief executive officer of Johannesburg-based Allan Hochreiter
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone last week. The high will be $1,700,
below the record of $1,921.15 set in 2011, he said.  “I think America will sort itself out and the economy will
start moving again, positively,” Hochreiter, 55, said from
Inhambane,  Mozambique . “As gold declines, as the world economy
improves, so will the industrial side, and platinum, palladium
and silver will start to pick up.”  Hochreiter forecast an average $1,650 for gold last year.
Bullion for immediate delivery was at $1,646.39 by 3:30 p.m. in
London today. Allan Hochreiter does corporate finance in mining.  Silver, platinum and palladium exceeded gold’s 7.1 percent
gain last year. Industrial demand from solar panels to batteries
and film accounts for about 53 percent of silver demand, the
Washington-based Silver Institute estimates. Platinum and
palladium are mainly used in catalytic converters in automobiles
and other industrial applications.  ETP Holdings  Holdings in gold-backed  exchange-traded products  were at
2,623.2 metric tons on Jan. 4, 9.3 tons below the record set
Dec. 20, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They rose 12 percent
last year, compared with increases of 9.4 percent for silver
products, 16 percent for platinum and 11 percent for palladium.  “Platinum may take another year or so before it beats
gold,” Hochreiter said. “Then it’s going to stay above gold
for the next upward cycle, which could be five or six years.”  Revived demand for gold jewelry will be insufficient to
keep bullion climbing because prices are more dependent on
investments, according to the CEO.  “The price is made because of the insurance, because of
what the dollar is doing, not what physical jewelry demand is
doing,” Hochreiter said.  The LBMA awards the top forecasters with a 1-ounce gold
bar. Hochreiter said he won’t be selling.  “Unless you really have to sell, you don’t sell it,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
