U.S.  nuclear-power production 
advanced for a second day as  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  returned its 1,134-
megawatt Limerick 2 reactor to full power in  Pennsylvania .  Generation nationwide gained 1.1 percent to 92,828
megawatts, or 91 percent of capacity, according to U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. Output was 3.3
percent less than a  year ago  with seven of 104 units shut.  Limerick 2, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of
Philadelphia, was at 100 percent of capacity early today
compared with 65 percent  yesterday , when an emergency
ventilation system was removed from service for maintenance,
according to an NRC report.  The removal of the system “was unrelated to the reduction
in power that occurred over the weekend,” Dana Melia, a
spokeswoman at the plant, said in an e-mail today. “Both units
are operating at full power as of this morning.”  Limerick 2’s boost lifted production by 1.7 percent to
 24,899 megawatts  in the NRC’s Northeastern region. Output in the
Southeast rose 0.8 percent to 29,569 megawatts, the highest
level since July 15.  The  Tennessee Valley Authority ’s Sequoyah 2 reactor led the
southeastern gain after advancing by 248 megawatts to 56 percent
of capacity. The  1,126-megawatt unit , which yesterday operated
at 34 percent, is returning to service after completing
refueling and maintenance that began Oct. 15.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
