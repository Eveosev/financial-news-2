European power contracts for February
delivery climbed as fuel prices advanced on forecasts for
freezing weather.  German February power added as much as 3.2 percent to a
record while the equivalent French contract gained 3.5 percent,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Dutch gas  for
next-month rose 2.4 percent as European Union emissions permits
gained 4.7 percent.  German baseload power, for supplies delivered around the
clock, increased as much as 1.60 euros to 51.85 euros ($67.52) a
megawatt-hour, the highest since the contract started trading in
October, and was at 51.10 euros at 5 p.m. in Berlin. French
month-ahead electricity rose as much as 2 euros to 60 euros, the
most since Dec. 6.  Dutch next-month gas, the benchmark for mainland  Europe ,
added as much as 65 cents to 27.90 euros a megawatt-hour, while
EU carbon permits for December rose 30 cents to 6.64 euros a
metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. Power
can track fuel and emissions prices, which affect the cost of
production at plants that burn fossil fuels.  Low temperatures in  Frankfurt  are forecast to decline to
minus 8 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) on Jan. 15
versus a five-year average for the time of year of zero degrees,
according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. Minimum
temperatures in Paris are expected to fall to minus 6 degrees on
Jan. 15, compared with 7 degrees today.  Next-week power in  Germany  added as much as 22 percent to
55 euros while the French contract added as much as 39 percent
to 65 euros, broker data show. Both contracts rose to the
highest since Dec. 7.  Electricite de France SA had an unplanned halt at its 890-
megawatt Dampierre-4 nuclear power plant, French grid operator
RTE says on its website.  German 2014 power, a European benchmark, was little changed
at 45.20 euros a megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
