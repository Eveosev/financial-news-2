The rand weakened as local importers
took advantage of a December rally to buy foreign currency and
the dollar advanced against most currencies after the U.S.
created more jobs than expected in December.  South Africa ’s currency depreciated as much as 0.6 percent
and traded 0.4 percent lower at 8.5977 per dollar by 3:39 p.m.
in Johannesburg. Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due
December 2026 dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point,
to 7.28 percent.  Most South African businesses re-open today after the
three-week summer holiday that started on Dec. 17. The rand
rallied 5.1 percent in December, the best performer of 16 major
currencies monitored by Bloomberg and traded as low as 8.6793 on
Dec. 14.  “We are already seeing some importers in the market; guys
getting back into their offices,” Ion de Vleeschauwer, chief
dealer at Bidvest Bank Ltd. in Johannesburg, said by phone.
“The rand is a lot stronger than it was when most businesses
closed.”  The dollar advanced 0.2 percent against the euro to 1.3037
and was stronger against 12 of the 16 major currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  U.S. payrolls rose by 155,000 workers last month following
a revised 161,000 advance in November, which was more than
initially estimated. The median estimate of 82 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg had called for an increase of 152,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
