Polish electricity  for next-day
delivery rose to the highest price in almost three weeks amid
increased exports and unplanned outages.  Next-day power gained 1 percent to 184.18 zloty ($58.44) a
megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s
the highest price since Dec. 20.  Poland was set to export 1,245 megawatts of electricity to
the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovakia from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m.
tomorrow, compared with 380 megawatts during the same period
today, data from grid manager PSE Operator SA showed. Imports
from  Sweden  were due to decrease, the data showed.  Utilities including  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA,  PGE SA (PGE)  and  Enea SA (ENA)  said
they would keep 933 megawatts of capacity off line tomorrow for
unscheduled outages.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the Czech
Republic and Slovakia jumped 15 percent to 49.99 euros ($65.37)
a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countries’
 market operators . Hungarian day-ahead power added 13 percent to
50.67 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
