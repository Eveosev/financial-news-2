Azerbaijan exported less crude oil
through the port used by the BP Plc-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline last year as the nationâ€™s production declined.  Oil exports through Ceyhan harbor fell 12 percent to 20.19
million metric tons, while they rose 3.4 percent to 2.74 million
tons at Supsa port and gained 0.6 percent to 2 million tons at
the Novorossiysk facility. Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil
producer in the former Soviet Union, pumped a combined 24.9
million tons, down 9.6 percent, from the ports, according to
data on the  website  of State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar.  Oil production slid 3.7 percent last year to 43.9 million
tons, Socar President Rovnaq Abdullayev said Dec. 30. Natural
gas rose 8.3 percent to 27.9 billion cubic meters, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
