IDE Technologies Ltd., jointly owned
by  Delek Group Ltd. (DLEKG)  and  Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) , said contracts it
signed to design the largest seawater desalination plant in the
U.S. and provide maintenance are valued at $650 million.  Construction on the reverse osmosis Poseidon project to
supply as much as 54 million gallons of fresh drinking water a
day by 2016 is set to begin this month near the Encina power
station north of San Diego in Carlsbad, California.  IDE said the design and equipment supply contract with
Kiewit Shea Desalination is for $150 million while a 30-year
operating and maintenence contract with Poseidon Resources
Corp., based in Stamford, Connecticut, is worth $500 million.
IDE has worked on about 400 such projects globally, including
the Ashkelon and Hadera desalination plants in  Israel .  The Poseidon desalination and pipeline project is a $922
million venture structured as a public-private partnership that
includes $755 million in tax-exempt bonds sold last month, $167
million in private equity investment and a regional water
purchase agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
