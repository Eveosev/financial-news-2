South Korea ’s won was little changed
after retreating from a 17-month high on speculation authorities
stepped in to slow the currency’s appreciation.  The won was at 1,063.45 per dollar as of 10:13 a.m. in
Seoul compared with 1063.68 on Jan. 4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,060.50 earlier, the
strongest level since Aug. 4, 2011, after U.S. jobs data showed
employers in the world’s largest economy added workers in
December even as Congress battled over the budget. The jobless
rate held at 7.8 percent, Labor Department figures showed Jan.
4, matching an almost four-year low.  “Speculation is that authorities took action to slow the
won’s gains,” said Cho Young Bok, Seoul-based currency dealer
at Daegu Bank. “It seems the authorities want to sustain the
currency above 1,060 to the dollar.”  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said last week he was
concerned about herd behavior in the foreign-exchange market and
the government was actively considering measures to curb
volatility in the won, which was  Asia ’s best-performing currency
of 2012, with an 8.3 percent advance versus the dollar.  South Korean President-Elect Park Geun Hye’s new
administration probably won’t continue policies to keep the
currency “artificially weak,” the Seoul Economic Daily
reported today,  citing an unidentified official in Park’s
transition committee.  Employers in the U.S. added 155,000 workers last month
after 161,000 in November, Labor Department figures showed Jan.
4. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index closed Jan. 4 at the highest
level since December 2007.  Jobs Data  “Improvement in the U.S. jobs data and a rise in the U.S.
stock market are pushing up the Korean won,” Hong Seok Chan, an
analyst at Daishin Economic Research Institute in  Seoul , said
before the suspected intervention. “Still, anticipation that
South Korean authorities may try to stem the won’s gain is
preventing the currency from rising further.”  The yield on South  Korea ’s 2.75 percent bonds due 2015 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.75 percent,
according to Korea Exchange prices.  Policy makers at the  Bank of Korea  meet on Jan. 11 to
review borrowing costs. The central bank kept the benchmark
 seven-day repurchase rate  at 2.75 percent last month, after cuts
of 25 basis points at reviews in July and October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
