Lithuania ’s desire to improve
relations with neighboring  Russia  and Belarus doesn’t mean the
Baltic nation plans to distance itself from Western allies such
as the U.S., Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said.  “We have to keep relations as good as possible both with
neighboring countries and with the U.S.,” Butkevicius, whose
coalition government took office last month after October
elections, told reporters today in the capital Vilnius.  He declined to say whether he agreed with Parliamentary
Speaker Vydas Gedvilas, who last week criticized U.S. Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton’s opposition to Russia’s growing
economic might in Europe as unpractical. Speaking on Radio
Svoboda in Moscow on Jan. 3, Gedvilas said the U.S. was “very
far away” and had no  gas pipeline  that reached Lithuania.  The new Cabinet’s official policy program calls for a
“reboot” of relations with Russia. Above all, it seeks to
negotiate lower prices for the Russian natural gas and power
that Lithuania relies on, according to Butkevicius.  To contact the reporter on this story:
