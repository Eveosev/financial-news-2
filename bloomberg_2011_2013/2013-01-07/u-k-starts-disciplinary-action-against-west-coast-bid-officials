Disciplinary action has begun against
U.K. government officials involved in the flawed evaluation of
bids for the West Coast rail franchise, the House of Commons
Transport Committee was told today.  The actions, which follow an internal review, concern an
unspecified number of civil servants, Philip Rutnam, permanent
secretary to the Department for Transport, said at the latest
hearing into the West Coast bid process, which saw  FirstGroup
Plc (FGP)  stripped of a contract after complaints from Virgin Trains.  DfT officials “knew things were awry” in the assessment
of bids but failed to properly escalate their concerns, Rutnam
said, adding that lapses may have been ignored because of a
culture of “completion at any cost” for franchise awards.  The conclusions of a probe into the wider rail franchising
system will be made known “shortly,” Secretary of State for
Transport Patrick McLoughlin told the committee.  The cost of the West Coast failure in terms of refunds to
bidders has increased to about 45 million pounds ($72 million),
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
