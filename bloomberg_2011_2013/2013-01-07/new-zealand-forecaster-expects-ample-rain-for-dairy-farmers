New Zealand  will avoid soaring
temperatures and dry rivers in the first quarter, adding to
signs of minimal disruption to milk production, which generates
a quarter of the nation’s exports.  Rainfall, river flows and soil moisture will be normal for
this time of year in most regions in the three months through
March, with the exception of the east of the North Island where
it may be drier, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric
Research said today in a  report  on its website. Temperatures
will be average everywhere except the west of the North Island
where it may be cooler, the government agency said.  Most milk production in the world’s biggest dairy exporter
occurs in the west and north regions of the  North Island  where
weather conditions will be favorable, according to the
Wellington-based institute. There is a 30 percent chance of
below-normal rainfall in the Waikato and Taranaki dairy regions.  Dairy, meat and wool comprise about 40 percent of the
nation’s exports, with merchandise shipments making up 30
percent of gross domestic product. A severe La Nina weather
pattern in early 2008 led to drought and helped tip the nation
into a recession as milk production slowed and farmers reduced
sheep and cattle numbers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
