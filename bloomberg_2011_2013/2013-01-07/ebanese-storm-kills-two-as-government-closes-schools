A storm sweeping across Lebanon for
the second day killed two people, including a six-month-old baby
boy washed away by floods, blocked roads and led the government
to order school closures for 48 hours starting tomorrow, the
official National News Agency said.  The stormy weather is expected to continue for the next
couple of days, with winds reaching 80 kilometers an hour (50
miles per hour) and snow falling at 300 meter (1,000 feet)
elevations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
