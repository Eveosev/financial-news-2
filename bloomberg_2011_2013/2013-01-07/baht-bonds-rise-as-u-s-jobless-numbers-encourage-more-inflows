Thailand ’s baht advanced toward a 10-
month high and government bonds rose as U.S. jobless numbers
supported demand for emerging-market assets.  Employers in the U.S., Thailand’s third-largest export
market, added 155,000 workers last month, more than the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey for 152,000, Labor Department
figures showed Jan. 4. Global funds purchased $128 million more
Thai equities than they sold last week and bought a net $341
million of sovereign securities, according to data from the
stock exchange and the Thai Bond Market Association.  “Funds have been flowing into Asia and good data leads to
speculation of more inflows into the region,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc.
in  Tokyo . “The situation will continue and that supports Asian
currencies.”  The baht strengthened 0.3 percent to 30.43 per dollar as of
8:57 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 30.29 on Jan. 3, the highest level since
March 1, 2012. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.05 percent.  The Bank of Thailand meets to set interest rates on Jan. 9.
All 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the benchmark
will be left at 2.75 percent. It was cut by 25 basis points in
October last year.  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due June 2023 dropped
one basis point to 3.68 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
