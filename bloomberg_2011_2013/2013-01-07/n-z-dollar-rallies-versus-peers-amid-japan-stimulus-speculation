New Zealand ’s dollar rose versus all
of its 16 most-traded peers amid speculation  Japan  will increase
spending to bolster its economy, supporting demand for higher-
yielding assets.  Australia’s dollar approached the strongest in more than
two weeks versus its U.S. counterpart as commodities gained.
Both the Aussie and the New Zealand currency, called the kiwi,
touched for a second day the highest level against the yen in
more than four years. A report due this week is forecast to show
an increase in retail sales in Australia.  The  New Zealand dollar  advanced 0.7 percent to 83.71 U.S.
cents yesterday in  New York . The kiwi appreciated 0.3 percent to
73.49 yen and touched 73.55 yen, the strongest level since
September 2008.  The Aussie rose 0.2 percent to $1.0503. It reached $1.0513
earlier, after touching a more-than two-week high of $1.0527 on
Jan. 3.  Australia ’s dollar reached 92.85 yen today, the highest
level since September 2008, before trading at 92.22 yen, down
0.2 percent.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose for
the first time in three days, gaining 0.3 percent.  Japan’s government will announce 12 trillion yen ($137
billion) of fiscal stimulus this month to boost the nation’s
shrinking economy, the Yomiuri newspaper said yesterday. The
extra budget for this fiscal year through March will include 5
trillion yen to 6 trillion yen of public-works spending, the
newspaper reported, without saying where it obtained its
information.  Australia’s Bureau of Statistics will probably say on Jan.
9 that retail sales rose 0.3 percent in November after stalling
the previous month, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
