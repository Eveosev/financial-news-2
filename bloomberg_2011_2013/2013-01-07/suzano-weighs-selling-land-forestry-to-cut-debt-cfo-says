Suzano Papel & Celulose SA (SUZB5) , Latin
America’s most indebted pulpmaker, is considering the sale of
farmland and forestry assets to reduce leverage, Chief Financial
Officer Alberto Monteiro said.  “We are studying a few alternatives, and selling land or
forestry is one of them,” Monteiro, 45, said today in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “We should make a decision
on whether to put them on sale soon.” He declined to disclose
how much the company may raise with the sales.  Suzano’s  debt  jumped 56 percent in the past two years after
it bought a stake in a paper and pulp producer and expanded some
plants to double output by 2016. Last year Suzano raised 1.5
billion reais ($739 million) in a share sale to cut debt, and in
December it agreed to sell a 17.9 percent stake in a Brazilian
utility for 320 million reais.  Shares rose 1.3 percent to 7.23 reais at 4:26 p.m. in Sao
Paulo. The Bovespa stock index fell 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
