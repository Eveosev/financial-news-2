(Corrects to show that Osawa is chairman and CEO of U.S.
unit in first paragraph.)  Sharp Corp. (6753)  is on track to post
double-digit sales growth in the U.S. for the third-straight
year, said Toshiyuki Osawa, chairman and chief executive officer
of the company’s U.S. unit.  The components business will double sales in the fiscal
year through March 31, Osawa said at the  Consumer Electronics
Show  in Las Vegas.  The maker of Aquos TVs said in November there was
“material doubt” about its ability to survive after
hemorrhaging 103 billion yen ($1.2 billion) in cash from
operations in the fiscal first half amid falling demand and
competition from  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  Sharp turned to
 Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) , the biggest maker of mobile-phone chips, for as
much as 9.9 billion yen in new capital after failing to secure a
planned investment from Foxconn Technology Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
