Airbus SAS won a tentative $2.8
billion order from Hawaiian Airlines for A321neos that can fly
from the islands to the western U.S. coast, dislodging  Boeing
Co. (BA)  as the carrier’s only supplier for single-aisle jets.  Completing the order depends on reaching an agreement with
pilots and flight attendants for operation of the new aircraft
type, Honolulu-based  Hawaiian Holdings Inc. (HA)  said in a statement
today. The catalog value for the order includes 16 jetliners
from 2017 to 2020 and rights to purchase as many as nine more.  Airbus’s win underscores the advantage gained by offering
wingtips, which it calls “sharklets,” to boost the flight
range of single-aisle jets. The 8-foot-high tips add roughly 100
nautical miles (115 miles) to current models. The neos, which
offer newer engines and include wingtips as a standard feature,
can fly an additional 450 nautical miles.  The planes “promise total operating costs that are
competitive with, and in some cases slightly below, those of
existing wide-body aircraft,” Hawaiian Chief Executive Officer
Mark Dunkerley said in a telephone interview today. “Plus they
allow the flexibility to enter into some markets which are
slightly too small to support the wide-body airplanes that we
fly today.”  The A321neo, seating 190 passengers and covering a range of
3,650 nautical miles, will complement the twin-aisle planes that
Hawaiian already flies between the islands and the West Coast,
the airline said. Potential new routes with the Airbus planes
may include flights to Maui and Kona from the California cities
of  Sacramento  and San Diego, markets where demand isn’t strong
enough to justify the larger aircraft, Dunkerley said.  Airbus Shift  Hawaiian has gradually increased the proportion of its
fleet comprised of Airbus models. It now operates 25 wide-body
aircraft including Airbus A330-200 aircraft, seating 294
passengers each, and Boeing 767-300ER aircraft, seating 264. Its
18 narrow-body planes are all 123-seat Boeing 717-200 aircraft
used for flights between  Hawaii ’s islands.  Hawaiian plans to continue using the 717s for those routes,
said Ann Botticelli, a spokeswoman.  “The Boeing 717s are absolutely the best airplane built
today for flying between the islands in the state of Hawaii,”
Dunkerley said. “We’re very happy with them. We intend to keep
operating them at least until the end of the decade. Beyond
that, we’ll have to see what’s available.”  The  shares  of parent Hawaiian Holdings rose 1.3 percent to
$7.20 at the close of  New York  trading, the highest since
February 2011.  Outstanding orders at the airline include 13 A330s to be
delivered through 2015, and six longer-range A350XWB-800
aircraft starting in 2017.  The existing fleet of 16 Boeing 767s will be phased out
over the next 10 years, the airline said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
