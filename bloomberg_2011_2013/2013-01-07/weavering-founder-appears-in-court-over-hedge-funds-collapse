Weavering Capital (UK) Ltd. founding
director Magnus Peterson appeared in a London court today facing
six charges of fraud, forgery, fraudulent trading and false
accounting over the collapse of the hedge fund in 2009.  Judge Michael Snow ordered Peterson, 49, to appear at a
higher criminal court in 12 weeks and surrender his passport to
the Serious Fraud Office within seven days.  The defunct fund had about $640 million under management in
late 2008 before discovering the counterparty for its biggest
trading position was controlled by the fund’s manager.  Prosecutors at the SFO dropped their initial criminal probe
into Peterson over concerns it wouldn’t win a conviction. The
SFO reopened the case in July after the agency appointed a new
director.  If convicted of fraud Peterson, a Swedish national, could
spend as much as 10 years in prison, Nicholas Bull, the agency’s
lawyer, said in court today.  The hedge fund’s administrators won a lawsuit to recover
$450 million from Peterson and other former employees in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
