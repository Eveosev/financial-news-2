The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is
poised to retreat further from a five-year high as earnings
disappoint investors, according to  Jonathan Golub  at UBS AG.  “All we’ve done is to put off the very hard decisions
around the fiscal cliff,” Golub, chief U.S. market strategist
at UBS, said in a Bloomberg Radio interview with  Tom Keene  and
Ken Prewitt. “What we’re going to see in the earnings season is
that we may not be falling apart, but this underlying trend of
earnings growth really is going to be weak and disappointing.”  The earnings season will unofficially start tomorrow when
Alcoa Inc. becomes the first company in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average to announce results. Fourth-quarter profits from S&P 500
companies probably increased 2.9 percent, according to analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the second-
slowest  quarterly growth  since 2009, the data show.  Golub forecasts the S&P 500 will drop 2.8 percent from the
last close to 1,425 by the end of this year. That is more
pessimistic than the average estimate of 1,534 from 15
strategists, including Golub, surveyed by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 surged 4.6 percent last week, the most since
December 2011, as lawmakers passed a bill averting spending cuts
and tax increases known as the fiscal cliff. The advance
prompted investors to cut demand for protection against losses,
driving down the cost of options every day during the week. The
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the
 VIX (VIX) , plunged 39 percent to 13.83 for the biggest slump since its
inception two decades ago.  The equities index slipped 0.4 percent to 1,460.69 as of
11:07 a.m. in New York today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
