Soybean and corn futures rose from
six-month lows on speculation that U.S. reserves fell to the
lowest in nine years after the worst drought in seven decades
damaged crops.  On Dec. 1, soybean inventories probably fell 16 percent
from a year earlier to the lowest since 2003, while corn
supplies dropped 15 percent, a Bloomberg News survey showed. The
U.S. government will update its estimates on Jan. 11.  “The market is beginning to refocus on tightening U.S.
supplies,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer
Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “We have had a big selloff, and there is some end-
user interest in locking in supplies.”  Soybean futures for March delivery climbed 1.6 percent to
close at $13.885 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since Dec. 21. On Jan. 4, the commodity
touched $13.56, the lowest intraday price since June 20.  On Dec. 31, the oilseed closed at $14.095, down 20 percent
from the record settlement of $17.6825 on Sept. 4. That signaled
the start of a  bear market .  Soybeans  inspected  for export rose 21 percent to 39.652
million bushels in the week ended Jan. 3 from a year earlier,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today.  Corn futures for March delivery gained 0.8 percent to
$6.855 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $6.78, the lowest
since July 3.  The price reached an intraday record of $8.49 on Aug. 10
after drought cut U.S. production to a six-year low.  Export demand for U.S. grain may increase after five
consecutive weeks of declines, Grow said. U.S. exporters sold
102,200 metric tons to unknown destinations, the USDA said
today.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
