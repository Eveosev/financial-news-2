Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  and  Banco
Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  led Portuguese banks higher after global
central bank governors allowed lenders to use a wider range of
assets to meet international liquidity rules.  Espirito Santo, the nation’s biggest publicly traded bank,
advanced 1.9 percent to close at 97.5 cents in Lisbon. Banco
Comercial climbed 2.6 percent to 7.9 cents.  “Portuguese banks are benefiting from the decision by
central bank chiefs yesterday that will help bolster lending and
the economy in Portugal,” said Alfredo Mendes, a trader at
Banco Best in Lisbon.  Banco BPI SA (BPI) , Portugal’s fifth-biggest bank, which along
with Banco Comercial received bailout funds from the Portuguese
government, rose 2.1 percent to 1.02 euros.  Central bank governors, meeting in  Basel , Switzerland,
allowed lenders to use an expanded range of assets including
some equities and securitized mortgage debt to meet the
liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR. Banks will also have an extra
four years to fully comply with the measure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
