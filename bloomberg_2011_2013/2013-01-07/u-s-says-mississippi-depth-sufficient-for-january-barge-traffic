The Mississippi River will be deep
enough through January to support commercial barge traffic,
Major General John Peabody of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
said, citing dredging and favorable  weather forecasts .  Peabody said today that dredging should maintain a 10-foot
channel through the end of the month, which is deep enough for
commercial vessels on the river south of  St. Louis .  The Corpsâ€™ work removing rock obstacles near Thebes,
Illinois, will continue until end of the month, Peabody said.
The channel should be 2 feet deeper by the end of this week, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
