Refineria la Pampilla SA , the Repsol
SA unit known as Relapasa, surged the most in 19 months as El
Economista reported the parent plans to sell the company.  The owner of  Peru ’s largest refiner rallied 9.7 percent to
68 centimos at 1:03 p.m. in  Lima  after earlier gaining as much
as 11 percent in the steepest intraday advance since June 2011.
Trading surged to 4.8 times the average full-day volume of the
past three months.  Repsol plans to sell the 102,000 barrel-a-day La Pampilla
refinery, 200 gasoline stations and the Sol Gas liquid petroleum
gas plant to raise $400 million, the Madrid-based newspaper  El
Economista  reported Jan. 6. Repsol spokesman Kristian Rix didn’t
return a telephone call and an e-mail message seeking comment.  “There is growing speculation among investors that Repsol
will shed its assets here,” Fernando Iberico, an analyst at SAB
Inteligo, said in a telephone interview. “Investors picked up
Relapasa cheaply after the stock plummeted last year.”  Relapasa tumbled 11 percent in 2012, compared with a 5.9
percent gain by the  Lima General Index. (IGBVL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
