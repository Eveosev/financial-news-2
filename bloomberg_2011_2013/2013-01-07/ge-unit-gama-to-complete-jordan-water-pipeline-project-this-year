Gama Enerji AS, a GE Energy Financial
Services Inc. and Gama Holding AS venture, expects to complete a
$1.1 billion water pipeline project this year to boost supplies
to Jordanâ€™s capital, Chief Executive Officer Arif Ozozan said.  Gama is carrying out the Disi project started in 2009 to
build a 330-kilometer (205-mile) pipeline to pump water to
 storage tanks  in Amman and will operate the pipeline for 25
years, Ozozan told reporters during a visit yesterday to  Libya .  Fifty-five wells are being drilled to extract water from a
southern aquifer near  Saudi Arabia , with water reserves expected
to last about 50 years as commercial operations supplying as
much as 100 million cubic meters of water a year begin later in
the second half of 2013, Ozozan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
