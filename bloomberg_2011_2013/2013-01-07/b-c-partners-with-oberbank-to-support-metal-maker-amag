B&C Industrieholding GmbH, the
investment vehicle of an Austrian non-profit foundation, and
 Oberbank AG (OBS) , said they will combine their holdings in  AMAG
Austria Metall AG (AMAG)  to support the aluminum products maker.  B&C and Oberbank will own 35 percent of AMAG after merging
their respective 29.99 percent and 5.01 percent stakes, the
companies said in separate statements today. B&C said it plans
to offer AMAG investors 20.81 euros ($27.28) a share plus their
dividend for 2012 as raising its stake to more than 30 percent
will trigger a compulsory offer.  The investment vehicle doesn’t intend to acquire all shares
and said a “meaningful” number will remain in circulation
after its offer, which will probably be made in March or April,
according to Vienna-based B&C’s statement.  B&C and Austrian lender Oberbank said they want to support
AMAG’s growth as “long-term core investors” and secure AMAG’s
facility in the Austrian town of Ranshofen on the German border.  AMAG shares rose 0.1 percent to close at 24.60 euros in
Vienna trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
