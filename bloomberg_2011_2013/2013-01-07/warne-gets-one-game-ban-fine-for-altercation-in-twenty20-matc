Shane Warne  was banned for one game
and fined A$4,500 ($4,700) by  Cricket Australia  after being
found guilty of three out of four code of behavior breaches for
his Twenty20 match altercation with West Indian Marlon Samuels.  The 43-year-old Warne, who retired from international
cricket in 2007 with an Australian record 708 Test wickets,
clashed with Samuels during last night’s Big Bash League match
between the Melbourne Stars and Melbourne Renegades.  Warne, the Stars’ captain, grabbed at the allrounder’s
shirt mid-pitch during the Renegades’ successful run chase at
the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the pair exchanged words.
Moments later, Warne hit Samuels with the ball when fielding
near the batsman, prompting Samuels to throw his bat in the air.  Cricket  Australia  said in a  statement  today that Warne was
guilty of engaging in inappropriate and deliberate physical
contact with another player, showing dissent at an umpire’s
decision and using obscene or offensive language. It cleared him
of throwing the ball at Samuels in a dangerous manner.  Samuels, who earlier grabbed Stars batsman  David Hussey  by
the shirt and prevented him taking off for a second run, was
charged with two offenses under the behavior code: engaging in
inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with another
player and “unbecoming behavior.”  Samuels was forced to retire hurt when on 17 with an eye-
socket injury after edging a delivery from Sri Lanka paceman
Lasith Malinga through the grill of his helmet. His disciplinary
hearing will be held when he’s able to participate, Cricket
Australia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
