Women with MBAs from top business
schools who go into the fields of  venture capital  and private
equity lag behind their male counterparts in pay by about 12
percent more than they did a decade ago.  Women earned 82.5 cents for every dollar men made in 2012,
down from 93.7 cents 10 years earlier, according to surveys by
 Bloomberg Businessweek .  Of the 11 most popular industries that MBAs enter after
graduation, women trailed men in pay in eight categories,
including finance, marketing and operations, according to the
survey. Women had the closest parity in consulting jobs, making
99 cents for every dollar their male classmates made.  Women outperformed men in salary in three fields: human
resources,  investment banking  and non-profit companies. Two of
those categories -- human resources and non-profits -- tend to
attract more women than men, which may explain why women in
these jobs are earning more, according to the survey.  The results are based on surveys from more than 27,000
business school graduates that Bloomberg Businessweek conducted
as part of its biennial rankings of full-time MBA programs
starting in 2002. The magazine reported last month that women
graduating from elite business schools made 93 cents for every
dollar men made in their first jobs last year, down from 98
cents a decade ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
