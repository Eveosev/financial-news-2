China  Galaxy Securities Co. may seek
as much as $1.9 billion in an initial public offering in Hong
Kong and  Shanghai , almost double an earlier target, after
Chinese stocks rallied from a four-year low, said two people
with knowledge of the matter.  The Beijing-based brokerage has submitted applications to
regulators in Hong Kong and China and may start the IPO in the
second quarter, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the plan is private. Central Huijin Investment Ltd., a
unit of China Investment Corp., owned 79 percent of Galaxy
Securities at the end of 2011, according to Huijin’s website.  China’s benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  has rebounded 17
percent from an almost four-year low on Dec. 3 after policy
makers pledged greater investment in urban development and
faster economic reform. Galaxy Securities had planned to seek
about $1 billion in the offering, people with knowledge of the
matter said in October.  21st Century Business Herald reported the latest
fundraising target on Jan. 4. An external spokeswoman for Galaxy
Securities declined to comment on the IPO plan.  Companies raised $14.6 billion through IPOs last year in
China, down 64 percent from 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Hong Kong  initial sales slumped by a similar magnitude, to
$7.9 billion, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
