China ’s money-market rate dropped for
a fourth day on speculation the central bank’s injections of
cash through reverse-repurchase agreements will help meet demand
for funds in the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China gauged investor appetite for
seven-, 14- and 28-day reverse repos scheduled for this week,
according to a trader required to bid at the auctions. The
central bank added 90 billion  yuan  ($14.4 billion) of capital
via five-day reverse repos on Jan. 5 at a yield of 3.3 percent,
according to a statement on its website.  “The market is confident that the reverse-repo operations
will help cover all the money demand,” said Liu Junyu, a
Shenzhen-based bond analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the
nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “Also, the cash shortage is over
since the holidays and year-end have passed.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 31 basis points to 3.19 percent as
of 10:25 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, declined one basis
point to 3.43 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bonds due August
2017 rose one basis point to 3.20 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
