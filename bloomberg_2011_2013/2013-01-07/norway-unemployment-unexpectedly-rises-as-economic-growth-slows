Norway’s jobless rate unexpectedly
rose in the October quarter as companies prepared for weaker
economic growth amid a recession in the euro area.  Unemployment rose to 3.2 percent from a revised 3.1 percent
in the previous period, the Oslo-based Statistics Norway said
today. The figure was above a 3 percent average forecast of 10
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The world’s fourth-richest nation per capita has so far
withstood a contraction in the euro area as record investment in
in its petroleum industry fuels demand for workers. Growth in
the  mainland economy,  which excludes oil, gas and shipping, is
estimated to slow to 3 percent in 2013 from 3.75 percent last
year, according to central bank forecasts.  “The overall picture is still a solid job market, but
there are some signs that employment growth is slowing,” said
 Kyrre Aamdal , a senior economist at DNB ASA in Oslo, in a note
to clients.  A central bank survey showed last month that Norwegian
companies expect weaker economic growth over the next six months
as  Europe ’s debt crisis hurts exports.  Policy makers, who expect unemployment to average 3 percent
this year, kept the bank’s benchmark rate unchanged at 1.5
percent in December and stuck to a plan to raise rates as soon
as March.  The krone weakened 0.2 percent to 5.6126 per dollar as of
10:34 a.m. in Oslo. The currency was 0.1 percent stronger
against the euro at 7.3170.  To contact the reporters on this story:
