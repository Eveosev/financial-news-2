Repower Systems SE, the German unit
of  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , will supply two U.K. wind farms developed
by companies including Infinergy Ltd. and Triodos Bank NV.  The Wear Point plant in South Wales and Avonmouth farm in
southwest  England  will each generate enough power for 5,000
homes, Repower said today in an e-mailed statement.  John Laing Plc, the London-based infrastructure company,
and developer Infinergy will start building the 8.2-megawatt
Wear Point facility in Pembrokeshire in the summer.  Norddeutsche Landesbank provided loans for the plant, which
will require 14.3 million pounds ($23 million) of investment,
John Laing said in a separate  statement  dated Dec. 14.  Triodos Renewables Plc and waste-to-energy company Geneco
Ltd. are developing the Avonmouth wind farm at a Bristol sewage
treatment works. The project, also 8.2 megawatts, is slated for
completion at the end of the year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
