Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s biggest
software maker, signed a lease for offices at 11 Times Square, a
midtown Manhattan skyscraper that was completed in 2011.  The technology company, based in Redmond, Washington, will
join the law firm Proskauer Rose LLP in the 1.1 million-square-
foot (102,000-square-meter) tower, developer  SJP Properties  said
today in a statement. Terms, including rent payments and the
size of the leased space, weren’t disclosed.  Including the Microsoft and Proskauer deals and seven other
agreements signed last year, the building is more than 70
percent  leased , Parsippany, New Jersey-based SJP said. The
company co-owns the tower, located across  Eighth Avenue  from the
Port Authority Bus Terminal, with a real estate investment unit
of  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  Proskauer Rose has more than
400,000 square feet in the building.  Microsoft’s lease was reported yesterday on the website of
the Wall Street Journal, which said the company was taking just
more than 200,000 square feet in the tower. Microsoft and the
landlords were represented by brokers from  Jones Lang LaSalle
Inc. (JLL) , with Lisa Kiell negotiating for the tenant and Mitchell Konsker leading a team working on behalf of SJP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
