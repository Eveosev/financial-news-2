Vietnam ’s three-year bonds rose for a
fifth day, the longest winning streak in more than five months,
on speculation banks invested surplus cash in debt as money-
market rates fell. The dong was little changed.  The interbank overnight deposit  rate  declined 54 basis
points, or 0.54 percentage point, to 3.58 percent today,
according to daily fixings by banks compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure has fallen 92 basis points since Jan. 2, signaling
funding availability has increased. Credit growth may be slow in
the first few months of 2013, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung
said in his New Year’s message posted on the government’s
website Jan. 1.  “The interbank market is well supplied,” said Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, head of fixed-income trading at Asia Commercial Bank
in  Ho Chi Minh City . “Almost all the local banks have surplus
money, so they are seeking to invest in short-term  government
bonds .”  The yield on three-year notes fell five basis points to
9.10 percent in Hanoi, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level since May 21 and
marks the longest run of declines since July 26.  The dong traded at 20,843 per dollar as of 2:17 p.m. in
Hanoi, the same rate as Jan. 4, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The State Bank of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at
20,828, unchanged since December 2011, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
