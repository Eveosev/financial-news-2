South African corn futures fell after
prices of the grain declined in the U.S., the world’s largest
grower.  White corn for delivery in March, the most active contract,
dropped 1.3 percent to 2,182.20 rand a metric ton ($254) by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. The
yellow variety for July delivery decreased 1.6 percent to 2,075
rand a ton.  Corn fell on the Chicago Board of Trade on Jan. 4, closing
at $6.8045 a bushel, a decline of 1.3 percent. It rose 0.6
percent to $6.8450, up from a six-month low, as of 12:09 p.m. in
 London .  “Prices are down today mainly because the Chicago prices
were down on Friday by close,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at
Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone today.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn,
also known as maize. White corn is a staple food, while yellow
corn is used as  animal feed .  Soybeans for delivery in March fell 2.1 percent to 4,610
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
