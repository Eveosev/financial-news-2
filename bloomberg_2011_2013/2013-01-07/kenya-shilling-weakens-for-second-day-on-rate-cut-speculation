Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
second day to a seven-month low on speculation the central bank
will cut its benchmark  interest rate  this week after inflation
slowed.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
0.2 percent to close at 86.45 a dollar, the lowest since May 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It had fallen to as
weak as 86.65 earlier in Nairobi, the capital.  The Central Bank of Kenya’s Monetary Policy Committee, led
by Governor Njuguna Ndung’u, will probably lower the main rate
by 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point, to 10 percent it
meets Jan. 10, according to the median forecast of five
estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Inflation slowed
for a 13th month to 3.2 percent in December from 3.3 percent a
month earlier, remaining below the government’s target of 5
percent, Nairobi-based Kenya Bureau of Statistics said Dec. 28.  “The shilling is under pressure due to an anticipated
rate-cut decision,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in a note
to its clients.  The central lowered the benchmark interest rate by 2
percentage points to 11 percent when it last convened on Nov. 7,
bringing the rate by 7 percentage points since July to stimulate
the economy. Growth picked up to 4.7 percent in the three months
to September after dropping to 3.3 percent in the second
quarter.  “The outlook is for a 50 to 100 basis-point cut as they
seek to support the economy but with a keen eye not to put the
shilling under further pressure,” Duncan Kinuthia, the head of
trading at Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone from
Nairobi.  The central bank accepted a total of 14.3 billion shillings
($165 million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  and term
auction deposits, a bank official who asked not to be identified
in line with policy, said by phone today.  The Ugandan shilling weakened 0.5 percent to close at
2,728.95 a dollar, declining for a third day. Tanzania’s
shilling slid for a fourth day, losing less than 0.1 percent to
close at 1,593 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
