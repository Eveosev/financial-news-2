Ireland’s National Treasury
Management Agency said it will seek to raise money through a
syndicated tap of its 2017 Treasury Bond “in the near future,
subject to market conditions.”   A syndicated tap is the sale, at a pre-determined price, of
additional amounts of an existing bond through a number of
appointed banks and is open to all institutional investors, the
Dublin-based debt agency said in an e-mail statement today. The
NTMA hired Barclays PLC,  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , Davy, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Societe Generale SA as joint lead
managers for the transaction.    The sale will “mark a massive step in Ireland’s long
process of fully regaining long term bond market access, and
fully normalising its primary market issuance, in 2013,” said
Owen Callan, an analyst with Danske Bank.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
