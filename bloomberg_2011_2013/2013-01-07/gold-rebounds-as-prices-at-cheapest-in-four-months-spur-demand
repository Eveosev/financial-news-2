Gold futures declined for the third
straight session on signs that Federal Reserve policy makers may
end monthly purchases of  U.S. debt  this year.  The drop today followed the longest run of weekly declines
since May 2004. On Jan. 3, minutes from the Fed showed $85
billion in monthly bond purchases, the third round of so-called
quantitative easing, probably will end sometime in 2013. Gold
gained 5.1 percent in September when the central bank announced
the stimulus measures.  “The market is lackluster since people want some clarity
from the Fed,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  Gold futures for February delivery fell 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,646.30 an ounce at 1:57 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. On Jan. 4, the price touched $1,626, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Aug. 21. Last week, the metal dropped
0.4 percent, the sixth straight decline. In the previous two
sessions, the commodity slumped 2.4 percent.  Fed Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker  said on Jan.
4 that further monetary stimulus is unlikely to boost economic
growth and will “test the limits” of the central bank’s
credibility. He speaks tomorrow in Columbia,  South Carolina .  Silver futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$30.082 an ounce.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery slipped 0.1 percent to settle at $1,556.30 an
ounce. Palladium futures for March delivery slumped 2.7 percent
to $670 an ounce, the biggest fall for a most-active contract
since Oct. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
