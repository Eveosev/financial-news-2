Severn Trent Plc, the U.K.’s second-
largest water company, said it pleaded guilty to allowing too
much ammonia from its Bishop’s Castle sewage treatment facility
to enter a nearby stream.  The fine from Telford Magistrates’ Court for ammonia
discharge violations from March 2010 to March 2001 totalled
almost 19,000 pounds ($30,000), the Environment Agency said in a
statement confirmed by Coventry-based Severn Trent. Three of 12
samples taken over the period surpassed permitted limits.  “We take pollution incidents extremely seriously and we
have worked hard to improve our performance over the last few
years,’’ Severn Trent said. It said it’s investing 1.1 billion
pounds to improve all its wastewater assets from 2010 to 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
