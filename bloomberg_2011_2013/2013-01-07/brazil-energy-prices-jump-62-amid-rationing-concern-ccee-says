Brazilian electricity prices surged
62 percent last week amid concern that low levels at hydropower
dams raises the risk of rationing, according to data released by
the countryâ€™s electricity trading board.  The weekly reference price, used for spot-market contracts,
rose to 554.82 ($274.83) reais per megawatt hour from an average
of 341.96 reais, the Sao Paulo-based electricity trading board,
known as CCEE, wrote on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
