Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark retreating after posting its longest streak of weekly
gains since March last year.  Nomura Holdings Inc.,  Japan ’s biggest brokerage by market
value, dropped 5 percent, halting a record winning streak on
speculation the stock may be overheating.  Aozora Bank Ltd. (8304) 
tumbled 10 percent after Reuters reported Cerberus Capital
Management LP may sell most of its stake in the lender. Shui On
Land Ltd. fell 1.5 percent after the Hong Kong-based developer
said it expects a significant decline in full-year profit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.3 percent to 131.49 as
of 8:05 p.m. Tokyo time, erasing gains of as much as 0.3 percent
earlier and heading for its first decline in five days. The
gauge posted its seventh weekly advance last week, the longest
winning streak since March last year, after U.S. Congress
approved a budget deal and manufacturing reports from China and
the U.S. added to signs of a global recovery.  “Some profit taking is to be expected given the recent
strong rally, particularly in Japan,” said  Yoji Takeda , who
oversees about $1.2 billion as Hong Kong-based head of Asian
equities at RBC Investment Management (Asia) Ltd. “There isn’t
much downside for the market. China’s economy is recovering and
the fiscal cliff in the U.S. has been resolved at least for the
short term.”  Overbought Signal  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slipped 0.8 percent, after
gaining 2.8 percent on Jan. 4, the best opening day for the
gauge since 2002. The measure’s 14-day relative strength index,
an indicator of trading momentum, reached 83 at the end of last
week. Some investors view a reading above 70 as a sign the
market has risen too far, too fast.  Australia ’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  lost 0.1 percent, while South
Korea’s Kospi Index was little changed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index was little changed.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index added
0.4 percent. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index climbed 1.2
percent to a record close.  Futures on the S&P 500 Index fell 0.1 percent today. The
gauge increased 0.5 percent on Jan. 4 as employers added more
workers while the jobless rate held at a level that’s unlikely
to hasten the end of Federal Reserve stimulus.  U.S. payrolls rose by 155,000 workers last month following
a revised 161,000 advance in November, which was more than
initially estimated. The median estimate of 82 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for an increase of 152,000. The
unemployment rate held at 7.8 percent, matching the lowest level
since December 2008.  Record Rally  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  surged 14 percent in 2012 as
central banks from the U.S.,  Europe , Japan and China took action
to spur economic growth. The Asia Pacific gauge traded at 14.1
times average estimated earnings, compared with about 13.2 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and about 11.9 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nomura sank 5 percent to 498 yen, halting a record 13-day
rally on speculation the stock may be overheating after the
shares’ 14-day Relative Strength Index increased to 93.6 on Jan.
4, the highest since October 1974.  Aozora Bank tumbled 10 percent to 250 yen. Cerberus will
sell as many as 632.5 million Aozora shares at a price to be
determined as early as Jan. 16, according to a statement from
the bank that confirmed the earlier Reuters report. Cerberus
owns 44.2 percent of the lender, or 729 million shares,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Softbank Complaint  Softbank Corp. dropped 1.9 percent to 3,065 yen after Crest
Financial Corp. said it will ask the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission to block the Japanese mobile-phone operator’s planned
acquisition of Sprint Nextel Corp.  Shui On Land, controlled by billionaire Vincent Lo, slipped
1.5 percent to HK$3.88 in Hong Kong. The company said full-year
profit will decline significantly as it completed fewer
residential projects last year compared to 2011.  LG Display Co. declined 2.6 percent to 30,050 won in  Seoul .
The world’s second-biggest maker of liquid-crystal displays,
along with Samsung Electronics Co., AU Optronics Corp., Innolux
Corp., Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp.
were ordered by China to pay a combined 353 million  yuan  ($56.7
million) for fixing LCD panel prices.  Among stocks that gained,  Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. (TWE) , the
world’s second-biggest listed wine producer, jumped 5.7 percent
to A$4.98 in Sydney.  The company may be a potential takeover target, the
Australian newspaper reported, citing an interview with Matt
Williams, head of equities at Perpetual Ltd. The Australian fund
manager  holds 5.1 percent of Treasury Wine, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
