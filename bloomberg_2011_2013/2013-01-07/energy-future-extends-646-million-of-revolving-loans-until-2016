Lenders to Energy Future Holdings
Corp.â€™s unregulated electricity unit agreed to extend the
maturity of $646 million in revolving credit commitments.  Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Co. added $340 million
in term loans due in 2017 to compensate creditors, who allowed
the power producer to push the maturity on commitments expiring
this year to 2016, Dallas-based Energy Future said today in a
regulatory filing. The company, formerly known as TXU Corp.,
requested the extension last month.  In 2007, KKR & Co., TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital
Partners took Energy Future private for $43.2 billion, the
largest leveraged buyout ever. The power producer has posted
seven consecutive quarterly losses and had $37.4 billion of
long-term borrowings as of Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
