Peru ’s sol depreciated for the first
time in a week as the central bank bought dollars to tame a
rally in the local currency.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.5460 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That
was its first decline since Dec. 28. The currency earlier
touched 2.5411, the strongest level since October 1996,  data 
from Peru’s financial regulator show.  The Andean nation’s central bank has stepped up dollar
purchases to ease gains in the sol as companies acquire local
currency to pay taxes before an annual deadline. The central
bank said on its website it bought $80 million in the spot
market today after buying $100 million on Jan. 4, the most in 11
weeks.  The central bank’s dollar purchases “offset the excess”
generated by companies’ selling, said Gonzalo Navarro, the head
trader at Banco Santander SA’s local unit.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 3.84 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price climbed 0.32 centimo to 125.95
centimos per sol at 2:57 p.m. in  Lima .  To contact the reporter on this story:
