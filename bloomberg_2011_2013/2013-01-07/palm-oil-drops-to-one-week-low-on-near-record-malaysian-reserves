Palm oil fell for a third day to a
one-week low on speculation that inventories in  Malaysia , the
world’s biggest producer after Indonesia, probably held near a
record last month as exports declined.  The contract for March delivery dropped as much as 1.2
percent to 2,438 ringgit ($801) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest price for the most-active
contract since Dec. 31, and was at 2,443 ringgit at 12:04 p.m.
in Kuala Lumpur. Palm oil lost 1.2 percent last week.  Stockpiles of the oil used in food and biofuels were 2.53
million tons in December compared to an all-time high of 2.56
million tons a month earlier, according to the median of
estimates from six analysts and two plantation companies in a
Bloomberg survey. Output probably fell 7.9 percent to 1.74
million tons, while  exports  dropped 3.6 percent to 1.6 million
tons, the survey showed. The Malaysian  Palm Oil  Board is
scheduled to release official data on Jan. 10.  “Selling pressure will still be there” as stockpiles are
high, said Ryan Long, vice president of futures and options at
OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “There’s a very good
chance of stocks going down at a faster pace from next month
onwards because of lower production.”  Output peaks from July to October before tapering off from
November, with January and February normally recording the
lowest output.  Palm oil for May delivery declined 0.8 percent to 6,970
 yuan  ($1,119) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .  Soybean
oil  for May retreated 0.8 percent to 8,698 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery gained 0.9 percent to $13.795 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for delivery
in March climbed 0.5 percent to 50.14 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
