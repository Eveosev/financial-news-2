Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped the most
in seven months on concern capital inflows will slow after the
 Federal Reserve  said it may halt its stimulus program, and as
the current-account gap worsens amid falling exports.  The Fed will probably end its $85 billion monthly bond
purchases sometime this year, according to the minutes of the
 Federal Open Market Committee ’s Dec. 11-12 meeting released on
Jan. 3. Indonesia’s exports contracted for an eighth month in
November. Its  current-account  shortfall was likely 2.5 percent
of gross domestic product last year, more than the central bank
forecast of 2.4 percent, Barclays Plc economist  Prakriti Sofat 
said last week.  “The rupiah is still on a depreciating trend,” said
Raditya Ariwibowo, a Jakarta-based treasury analyst at PT Bank
Negara Indonesia. “Inflows will slow after the Fed halts its
stimulus, while exports continue falling as long as the global
economy remains soft.”  The rupiah fell 1.4 percent to 9,795 per dollar as of 3:27
p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest decline since June 7, prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency touched
9,802, the lowest level since Sept. 16, 2009. One-month non-
deliverable forwards were little changed at 9,818, trading at a
0.2 percent discount to the spot rate, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Non-deliverable forwards are settled in dollars.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, was
steady at 5.7 percent today.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent notes due in
May 2023 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
5.11 percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. That’s the lowest level since Feb. 9 when it
reached a record low of 5.05 percent for benchmark 10-year
bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
