Natural gas futures fell for the
fourth time in five days after revised forecasts called for
milder weather in late January that would reduce fuel demand and
a government report showed record production.  Gas slid 0.6 percent after MDA Weather Services said a
midday weather update showed warmer weather for the Midwest and
the East over the next 11 to 15 days. Output in the contiguous
U.S. states climbed 0.4 percent to a record 73.54 billion cubic
feet a day in October, according to the Energy Department’s
monthly EIA-914 report.  “The market is holding out hope that colder weather at the
end of January will salvage the heating season,” said Teri Viswanath, director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in
New York. “The problem is the 11- to 15-day forecast turned
warmer. Less heating demand than originally expected will mean
slightly higher end-of-season storage levels. The 914 data is
just affirmation that supplies are continuing to grow.”  Natural gas for February delivery dropped 2.1 cents to
settle at $3.266 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume of 174,473 contracts at
2:42 p.m. was 42 percent below the 100-day average. Prices have
risen 6.7 percent from a year ago.  April $2.50 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading on the Nymex. They were down 0.4 cent to 0.9 cent on
volume of 1,873 lots as of 2:44 p.m. Puts accounted for 69
percent of the volume.  Weather Service  The weather outlook, based on an updated National Weather
Service model, “has come in substantially warmer” from Jan. 17
through Jan. 21, Steven Silver, a meteorologist with MDA in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in a note to clients. Below-normal
temperatures in the Midwest will become more seasonal during the
period and the East will see milder weather, he said.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
Energy Department data show.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its 2013 gas price forecast by
12 percent to $3.75 per million Btu from $4.25 because of mild
weather, Johan Spetz, an analyst with the bank in  New York , said
in a note to clients today.  “The market will likely be left with more gas in storage by
the end of the winter than we had anticipated,” Spetz said.  Unusually cold weather helped reduce a gas surplus at the
end of December after it widened earlier in the month, according
to the department’s weekly gas inventory report released Jan. 4.  Gas Surplus  U.S. stockpiles  fell 135 billion cubic feet to 3.517
trillion in the week ended Dec. 28, exceeding the five-year
average drop for the week of 111 billion.  A  surplus  to the five-year average fell to 12.4 percent
from 12.8 percent the previous week, the department said. The
supply gap from year-earlier levels narrowed to 0.7 percent from
2.3 percent. The surplus has persisted since September 2011 as
mild weather reduced demand and output rose to an all-time high.  “This turn in the weather for end January is incredibly
important to inventory forecasts,” Viswanath said. She now
expects stockpiles at the end of the heating season in March to
total about 2 trillion cubic feet instead of at 1.83 trillion
based on her original prediction in November.  Total U.S. gas production rose 2.5 percent in October to
82.93 billion cubic feet a day, the most in nine months, as new
wells came online at the Marcellus shale in the Northeast and
the Bakken shale in  North Dakota , the department said.  Shale Formations  Record production and stockpiles came as drilling
technologies such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, unlocked
deposits in shale formations. Output of marketed gas in 2013
will average 69.59 billion cubic feet a day, up 0.5 percent from
a record 69.22 billion last year, the department said in its
Dec. 11  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  The boom in oil and gas output helped the U.S. meet 83
percent of its energy needs in the first nine months of 2012, on
pace to be the highest annual level since 1991, department data
show.  Demand for gas-fueled electricity generation may also
decrease as output rises from U.S. atomic reactors. Total
nuclear-power production increased by 972 megawatts, or 1.1
percent, to 92,828 megawatts from yesterday, according to U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg.
Capacity was 91 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
