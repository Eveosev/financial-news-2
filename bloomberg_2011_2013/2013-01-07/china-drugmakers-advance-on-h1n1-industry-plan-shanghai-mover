Chinese  health-care shares  rose the
most in two weeks on speculation medicine demand will increase
after two women died from the H1N1 flu strain in Beijing and the
government set targets for growth in the biomedical industry.  Beijing Tiantan Biological Products Corp. (600161)  surged by the 10
percent daily limit to 13.41 yuan as of 1:07 p.m. in Shanghai.
 Hualan Biological Engineering Inc. (002007)  rallied 8.5 percent,
Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical Co. climbed 2.4 percent and
 Shandong Dong-E E-Jiao Co. (000423)  gained 2.4 percent in Shenzhen. A
gauge of health-care shares on the  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  jumped 1
percent, set for the biggest gain since Dec. 25.  The two women, aged 22 and 65, died amid the highest number
of flu cases in China’s capital since 2008, Beijing News
reported. Separately, the State Council said China is targeting
annual output growth of more than 20 percent from 2013 to 2015
in the biomedical industry, according to a statement posted on
the central government’s website yesterday.  The rally in drugmakers today “is related to short-term
panic buying after reports of H1N1 cases in some Chinese
cities,” said  Li Ying , a Shanghai-based analyst at Capital
Securities Corp. “Investors also favor prospects for the
industry after the release of the state council’s plan.”  People shouldn’t worry because the H1N1 virus, also known
as swine flu, has become a “seasonal strain” that can be
controlled and prevented, the  Beijing Centers for Diseases
Control and Prevention  was cited as saying in the article.  Swine flu spread quickly in China in 2009, prompting mass
inoculations by the Asian nation. The virus was responsible for
an estimated 659 deaths as of Jan. 2, 2010, China’s health
ministry said at the time.  Biomedical Growth  China will encourage the research and development of new
drugs, including vaccines, and improve the quality of its
medicines, the State Council said in yesterday’s  statement .
China needs to develop new medicines, crops, biofuels and
environmental technology as its population ages and to ensure
 food safety  and conserve energy, according to the statement.  Li Keqiang , No. 2 in the ruling Communist Party’s
hierarchy, urged yesterday that China increase financial support
to reform the medical industry.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
