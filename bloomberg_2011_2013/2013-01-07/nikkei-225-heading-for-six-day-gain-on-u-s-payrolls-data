Japanese shares  fell, with the Nikkei
225 Stock Average retreating after reaching a 22-month high on
Jan. 4 on speculation the market is overbought. Shares rose
earlier after U.S. payrolls increased.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s biggest brokerage by market
value, dropped 5 percent, halting a record winning streak on
speculation the stock may be overheating.  Aozora Bank Ltd. (8304) 
slumped 10 percent on a report that Cerberus Capital Management
LP plans to sell most of its stake in the lender.  Softbank Corp. (9984) 
fell 1.9 percent as Crest Financial Corp. seeks to block the
mobile carrier’s acquisition of Sprint Nextel Corp.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.8 percent to close at 10,599.01 in
Tokyo, with trading volume 11 percent higher than the 30-day
average. The gauge rose 2.8 percent in this year’s trading debut
on Jan. 4 to close at its highest since March 4, 2011. The
broader Topix Index today slid 0.8 percent to 881.06.  “The market is definitely showing overheating signs,”
said Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mizuho
Trust & Banking Co., a unit of  Japan ’s third-largest bank by
market value. “I think the yen may stay under downward pressure
until the new Bank of Japan governor is chosen. That’s one
reason why the market remains overbought.”  The Topix has risen about 23 percent since Nov. 14 when
elections were announced, driving the gauge into a bull market
on expectations a new government would call for more stimulus.
An advance of 20 percent or more from a low signals a bull
market to some investors.  BOJ Reshuffle  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a proponent for more easing,
will have a chance to reshape the Bank of Japan early this year,
when the terms of Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his two
deputies expire. The yen reached 88.41 against the dollar on
Jan. 4, the lowest since July 2010. A weaker yen boosts the
value of overseas earnings at Japanese exporters.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  capped the first drop in six trading days as
its  14-day relative strength index  was 78 today, above the 70
threshold that some traders say signals a decline. Nomura
dropped 5 percent to 498 yen after a record 13-day rally through
Jan. 4 pushed its RSI to 94 last week.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  dropped 0.1
percent today. The gauge rose 0.5 percent in New York on Jan. 4,
when Labor Department figures showed U.S. payrolls added 155,000
workers last month following a revised 161,000 advance in
November. The unemployment rate held at 7.8 percent, matching
the lowest level since December 2008.  Aozora, Softbank  Aozora Bank plunged 10 percent to 250 yen after Reuters
reported that Cerberus Capital, the lender’s controlling
shareholder, plans to sell most of its stake. Shares of the
lender reached a four-and-a-half-year high of 278 yen on Jan. 4.
Cerberus plans to sell 591.25 million Aozora shares, according
to a statement filed after the market closed to the  Tokyo  Stock
Exchange today.  Aozora said in September that Cerberus planned to sell some
of its shares, without disclosing the portion. The same month,
the Tokyo-based lender unveiled a plan to pay 227.6 billion yen
to taxpayers following a bailout, as well as buy back stock and
pay a bigger percentage of profit as dividends.  Softbank fell 1.9 percent to 3,065 yen. Crest Financial
said Jan. 4 it will ask the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission to block Softbank’s $20 billion purchase of Sprint
along with Sprint’s planned acquisition of outstanding shares in
Clearwire Corp., a company in which Crest holds a stake.  Fujitsu Ltd., a provider of computer services, dropped 5.4
percent to 351 yen after its rating was cut to neutral from
overweight at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  dropped 6.6
percent to 20.51, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.9
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
