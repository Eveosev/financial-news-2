West Texas Intermediate crude will
probably advance to about $94 a barrel even after prices formed
a bearish hanging man pattern last week, according to  technical
analysis  by Futurestechs.com Ltd.  The crude for February delivery may move higher after
testing its short-term resistance on Jan. 2, Liam Roberts, a
technical analyst at the Billericay, England-based researcher,
said by phone today. WTI fell 49 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$92.60 a barrel as of 11:34 a.m. today in electronic trading on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  “We’re content backing the bulls,” Roberts said.
“There’s some selling, but there’s still room to move higher.”  A so-called hanging man pattern occurs on a candlestick
price chart when a security opens and closes near the same level
after falling during an intraday selloff. WTI was in this
formation on Jan. 4.  The pattern suggests “the bulls don’t have it all their
own way, although they do still remain in control,” Roberts
said in a note today.  WTI’s immediate price target is from $93.95 to $94.17 a
barrel, while support is at $91.85, he said. If the grade rises
above its short-term resistance, it may then rally to $100.  Gains are also backed by an uptrend channel established at
the beginning of the year, he said.  Money managers boosted bullish, or net-long positions for
Nymex WTI futures and options combined by 11 percent in the
seven days ended Jan. 1 to the most since Oct. 16, the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission said Jan. 4 in its weekly Commitments
of Traders report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
