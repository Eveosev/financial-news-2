Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , dropped for the first time in six
days after Bitport reported the company’s T-Systems unit is set
to lose a tender to supply an electronic road toll system.  The shares fell 0.8 percent to 389 forint by the end of
trade in Budapest, the biggest decline since Dec. 21. The
benchmark BUX stock  index , in which Magyar Telekom has the
fourth-biggest weighting at 11 percent, rose 0.6 percent.  Hungary will sign the toll contract with Getronics by Jan.
15, technology website Bitport reported, citing Development
Ministry State Secretary Vilmos Valyi-Nagy. The signing of the
contract was delayed after T-Systems disputed the process,
Valyi-Nagy said. Magyar Telekom rallied Jan. 4 after newspaper
 Napi Gazdasag  reported that T-Systems may emerge as the winner.  “It seems the state is still favoring Getronics,” Jozsef Miro, a Budapest-based analyst at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in
an e-mailed report today. “That is unfavorable for Magyar
Telekom as earlier reports said T-Systems may be the winner.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
