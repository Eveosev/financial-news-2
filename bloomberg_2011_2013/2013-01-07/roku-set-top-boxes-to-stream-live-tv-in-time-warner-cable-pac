Roku Inc., the closely held online
video service, said it’s adding 300 live television channels
through a partnership with  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)   The deal allows Time Warner Cable  subscribers  with Roku
devices to access live TV and Internet video from sites such as
 Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube from the same set-top
box, the companies said in a statement.  This is the first time Time Warner Cable, the second-
largest U.S. cable company, is streaming its live TV channels to
a consumer device connected to the television, the company said.
Time Warner Cable Chief Operating Officer Rob Marcus said in
September the New York-based company wanted to ensure its
customers could get its video service using any technology they
prefer.  “The availability of a service like TWC TV on an open
platform represents significant milestones for both Time Warner
Cable and Roku as well as for the industry overall,” Anthony Wood, founder and CEO of Saratoga, California-based Roku, said
in the statement.  Time Warner Cable fell 0.5 percent to $97.26 at the close
in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
