U.K. natural gas for same-day
delivery advanced the most in more than four months as  Statoil
ASA (STL)  said production from  Norway  was reduced, tightening the
British delivery network.  The  within-day  contract surged 6.7 percent, the most since
Aug. 20, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Gas
supply will be cut by 17 million cubic meters a day for an
unspecified period, Statoil said on its website today. The
delivery network will contain 327 million cubic meters at 6 a.m.
tomorrow, down from 345 million 24 hours earlier,  National Grid
Plc (NG/)  data show.  Gas for today climbed 4.2 pence to 66.4 pence a therm at
8:37 a.m.  London  time.  Next-month gas  jumped 2 percent to 68.1
pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.92 per million British
thermal units and compares with $3.32 per million Btu of front-
month U.S. gas.  A restriction on injections into  Centrica Plc (CNA) ’s Rough, the
U.K.’s largest gas-storage facility, ended Jan. 4, according to
a company website.  Imports from Norway were at a rate of 110 million cubic
meters a day versus a 10-day average of 116 million, Gassco AS
data show.  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 261
million cubic meters compared with a seasonal normal of 309
million National Grid data show.  The low temperature in London today was 7 degrees Celsius
(45 Fahrenheit) versus a five-year average of zero,
CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg show.  Gas accounted for 24 percent of U.K. power production at
8:40 a.m., grid data show. Coal generated 46 percent, nuclear 20
percent and wind 3.6 percent.  Electricite de France SA will start its 605-megawatt
Hartlepool-1 reactor in the U.K. on Jan. 10, two days earlier
than planned, according to the company’s website. The unit
halted Jan. 3.  Electricity for the next working day increased 0.4 percent
to 47.75 pence a therm, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
