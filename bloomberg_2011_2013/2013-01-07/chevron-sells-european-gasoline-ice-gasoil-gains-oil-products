European naphtha declined as Vitol
Group sold two cargoes, bringing its total in the past two
sessions to six lots.  Diesel barges gained as Trafigura Beheer BV and Gunvor
Group Ltd. bought. Gasoil rose for the first time in three days
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Light Products  Naphtha traded at $929 and $933 a metric ton, according to
a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window which showed Trafigura and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
as buyers. Deals were done Jan. 4 at $932 to $934 a ton.  Vitol bought 17 naphtha lots in the last week of December,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent crude, was unchanged
at $6.20 a barrel as of 2:14 p.m. local time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in London.  Gasoline  barges  traded from $970 to $981.50 a ton in the
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area, according to a similar survey
of the Argus Bulletin Board and the Platts. That compares with
deals from $967 to $978 on Jan. 4.  Chevron, Vitol, Gunvor and Total SA sold barges of the
Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.
Trafigura, Shell and Gunvor bought barges that typically
comprise 1,000 to 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack , or premium to  Brent crude , rose to $6.76
a barrel, compared with $6.66 on Jan. 4, according to PVM data.  Middle Distillates  Diesel barges rose to trade at $20 to $21 a ton more than
January gasoil versus plus $20 in the previous session, the
survey of Platts showed. BP and Argos Groep BV sold, and Vitol
bought.  Heating oil barges traded from a $1 discount to January
gasoil to parity to the marker as Mercuria Energy Trading SA,
Shell and Mocoh SA bought from Vitol and Gunvor. That compares
with a discount of $1 on Jan. 4.  Gasoil for January delivery rose $8.25, or 0.9 percent, to
$936.75 as of 5:30 p.m. London time.  The contract’s discount to February futures was $1.75 a
ton, keeping the market in contango, a structure that can signal
falling demand or rising supply.  Gasoil for January delivery last closed at a premium to the
next-month contract on Dec. 24.  Gasoil’s crack  gained to $15.03 a barrel versus $13.64 in
the previous session. Brent fell 0.3 percent to $111.02 a barrel
on ICE.  Hedge funds  and other money managers increased bullish bets
on the fuel, ICE data show.  Money managers’ net-long bets on gasoil increased to 52,985
positions in the week to Dec. 31 from 50,223 in the previous
period, the data showed. It is the highest since the week ended
Dec. 4.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  changed hands from $602.50 to $603.50
a ton, the survey of Platts showed. That compares with $601 to
