Chile ’s peso, the strongest emerging-
market currency this year, rose to an 11-week high after
economic activity expanded faster than forecast and the country
posted its biggest  trade surplus  since April 2011.  The peso climbed 0.3 percent to 471.9 per  U.S. dollar  as of
10:26 a.m. in Santiago. It earlier touched 471.3 per dollar, the
strongest since Oct. 17. The currency has appreciated 1.5
percent this month, more than any of the 24 other emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Economic activity  grew 5.5 percent in November from a year
earlier, the central bank said today, more than the 5.2 percent
median forecast of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. A
separate report showed that Chile had a $1.5 billion  trade
balance  on December, exceeding estimates for $200 million.  “The dollar is falling on local data,” said Ronald Volpi,
the head of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica Corredores de
Bolsa SA in Santiago. “We had good growth and excellent copper
exports. We’re full of dollars.”  Chile  exported  $4.7 billion of copper in December,
accounting for 61 percent of the country’s goods sent abroad,
according to the central bank.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
had a $3.9 billion short peso position on Jan. 3, the smallest
since November 2011. Local investors had a $14.1 billion long
peso position, up from the 13-month low reached on Jan. 2  Chile’s one-year basis swap rate rose to a six-month high
of 20 basis points today from 15 basis points on Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
