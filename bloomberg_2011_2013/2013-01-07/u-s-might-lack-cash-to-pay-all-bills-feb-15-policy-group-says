The U.S. might run out of funds to
pay all its bills as early as Feb. 15 after it exhausts
emergency measures undertaken when it hit the $16.4 trillion
 debt ceiling  at the end of last month, the Bipartisan Policy
Center said today.  The U.S. Treasury Department has started using so-called
“extraordinary measures” to keep funding the government.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said Dec. 26 that “under
normal circumstances” those  safety lines  would last for about
two months and create about $200 billion of “headroom.”  “Based on financial data from Treasury, we estimate that
the government will be unable to pay all of its bills as early
as Feb. 15,” Steve Bell, senior director of the economic policy
project at the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center, said
in an e-mailed statement today. “We have less time to solve
this problem than many realize.”  Republicans in Congress want to focus on spending cuts in
the current discussion over raising the debt limit, while
Democrats counter that issues including taxes have to be a part
of the negotiations.  Treasury Department spokesman  Matthew Anderson  today
referred to the Geithner’s Dec. 26 letter as the latest
guidance.  The Bipartisan Policy Center seeks policy solutions in
health care, energy, national and homeland security,
transportation and the economy, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
