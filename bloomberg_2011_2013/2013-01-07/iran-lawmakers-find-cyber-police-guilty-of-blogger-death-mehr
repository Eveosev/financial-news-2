Iran ’s parliament said the Tehran
branch of the cyber police unit is responsible for the death in
detention of a blogger who had criticized the Islamic Republic’s
government, the state-run  Mehr   news agency  reported.  The finding was stated in a report by a special commission
set up in November to investigate Sattar Beheshti’s death, and
was read in a parliamentary session yesterday, Mehr said.
Beheshti is accused of spreading propaganda, insulting the
values of the Islamic Republic and seeking to act against
national security, according to the news agency.  Officials from the cyber police unit arrested the blogger
at home on Oct. 30 and transferred him to Evin Prison in the
capital the following day.  The Tehran cyber police, acting against judicial orders,
moved him on Nov. 1 to another location under its own
supervision where he was held without a permit, according to the
Mehr report. The location did not meet required standards,
including having closed-circuit cameras, and Beheshti was kept
there until his death Nov. 3, it said. Iranian officials said
last year that Beheshti’s body bore bruises and that he may have
died as result of a shock.  The case has drawn attention from human rights
organizations abroad, with the U.S. calling for an
investigation.  Iranian authorities last month fired the Tehran police
chief in charge of the cyber unit for negligence, and arrested
seven individuals linked to the case, three of whom remain in
custody, Mehr said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
