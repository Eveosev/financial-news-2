The U.K. appointed Stephen Lovegrove,
a former head of Deutsche Bank AG’s European media team, as
permanent secretary, or the top official, at the Department of
Energy and Climate Change.  Lovegrove is currently chief executive officer of the
Shareholder Executive, which helps manage government stakes in
businesses it owns or part-owns, and will take up his post on
Feb. 4, the Energy Department said today in a  statement .  Lovegrove joined the Shareholder Executive in 2004, and
became CEO in 2007. Prior to that, he spent a decade at Deutsche
Bank, according to the statement. He’s replacing Moira Wallace,
who announced her decision to step down in July, as the
department clashed with the Treasury over subsidies for
renewable power.  “Stephen’s proven commercial experience will be an
invaluable addition to the Department’s capability,” Energy
Secretary  Ed Davey  said in the statement. “We need to attract
billions in private sector investment to build new power
stations and to upgrade the energy efficiency of the nation’s
homes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
