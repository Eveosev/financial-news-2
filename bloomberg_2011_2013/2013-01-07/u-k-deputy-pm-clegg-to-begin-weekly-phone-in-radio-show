U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
will begin a weekly half-hour phone-in radio show in an effort
to reconnect with voters as his opinion-poll ratings slump.  Clegg will broadcast every Thursday, starting Jan. 10 at 9
a.m., as part of the Nick Ferrari program on  London ’s LBC
station. No other member of the government has a regular
broadcasting slot, partly because of laws requiring political
balance from radio and television stations.  The deputy prime minister has been the subject of personal
abuse since he took his Liberal Democrat party into coalition
with  David Cameron ’s Conservatives in 2010. He made a broadcast
last year apologizing for breaking a pre-election promise not to
vote for an increase in university tuition fees. Satirists
quickly set it to music and released it as a single.  “I don’t think you can do the right thing in government
unless you keep in touch with how people are thinking and
feeling,” Clegg told LBC today.  Clegg and Cameron will speak at a joint news conference in
London today to highlight their shared agenda as they publish a
Mid-Term Review summing up coalition achievements since 2010 and
announcing new policies.  A YouGov Plc poll in yesterday’s Sunday Times put the
Liberal Democrats on 10 percent, compared with a 23 percent
share of the vote at the general election. It found 74 percent
of adults said Clegg was doing a bad job as Liberal Democrat
leader, against 18 percent who said he was doing well, the worst
rating of the three main party leaders. The survey questioned
1,988 adults between Jan. 3 and Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
