First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest maker
of thin-film solar products, is licensing technology from
 Intermolecular Inc. (IMI)  to improve the performance of its panels.  First Solar announced the two-year collaboration in a
statement today. The deal extends an existing agreement. Ted Meyer, a spokesman for the Tempe, Arizona-based company,
wouldn’t provide terms in an e-mail.  First Solar is seeking to raise the efficiency of its
cadmium telluride solar-cells, the amount of energy in sunlight
that’s converted into electricity. The company expects the
partnership to yield “substantial gains” that go beyond
previously announced plans, according to the statement.  The effort will augment the company’s existing research and
development capabilities, enabling “better performance and
faster time-to-market,” Raffi Garabedian, First Solar’s chief
technology officer, said in the statement.  First Solar said Jan. 17 it reached an efficiency record of
14.4 percent using panels produced with factory equipment. Solar
manufacturers are working to increase this rate to get more
power from each panel and reduce the cost of solar energy.  First Solar’s cadmium telluride panels compete with
products made from polysilicon, a technology that’s generally
more efficient. San Jose-based  SunPower Corp. (SPWR)  the largest U.S.
maker of polysilicon-based solar products, sells panels with
efficiency rates of 20.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
