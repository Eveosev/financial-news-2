Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the biggest
wind-turbine maker, rose the most in six weeks after agreeing to
maintain 121 of its turbines at a wind farm in  Iowa .  Vestas jumped 6.8 percent to 36.70 kroner at the close in
Copenhagen, the most since Nov. 26. That’s the highest closing
price since Oct. 8.  The turbine company announced the three-year contract
extension for  Alliant Energy Corp. (LNT) ’s 200-megawatt Whispering
Willow Wind Farm-East power plant in a  statement  on its website
today. The facility can power about 50,000 homes and Aarhus,
Denmark-based Vestas has maintained it since it became
operational in 2009.  “This service contract also ensures jobs for Vestas
employees,” Chris Brown, president of Vestas’s U.S. and Canada
sales and service operations, said in the statement.  Vestas cut its workforce in the U.S. and Canada last year
to about 2,500 from 3,400 amid plans to reduce its total
headcount to about 16,000 by the end of 2013 from 22,721 in
2011.  Alliant Energy, which owns three other projects using
Vestas turbines, provides power and natural gas to more than 1.4
million customers in the U.S. Midwest, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
