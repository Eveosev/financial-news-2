Banks will exert more control over
the shipping industry this year, according to accounting firm
Moore Stephens.  Reorganizations and payment deferrals have become
widespread among shipping companies, Julian Wilkinson, a London-
based partner at Moore Stephens, said in an e-mailed statement
today. Vessel values are poised to fall further in 2013 and
scrapping of older ships probably will increase, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
