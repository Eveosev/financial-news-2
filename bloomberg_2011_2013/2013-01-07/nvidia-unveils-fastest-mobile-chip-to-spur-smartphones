Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) , which makes chips for
Microsoft Corp.’s Surface tablets, unveiled what it said was the
world’s fastest mobile processor to help boost sales in the
smartphone and tablet computer markets.  The Tegra 4 features a new core design, extra graphics and
improved communications capability, Chief Executive Officer Jen- Hsun Huang said late yesterday at a company event in Las Vegas.
It is based on  ARM Holdings Plc. (ARM) ’s latest design, the A15, and
it has a 72-core graphics processor and an LTE cellular
baseband, he said.  Nvidia also announced that it will introduce a mobile-
gaming device called Shield using the new processor as it seeks
to pare a reliance on graphics processors for personal
computers. The Santa Clara, California-based company is
challenging  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  and Intel Corp. as it tries to boost
sales of chips for mobile devices.  “Tegra 4 is the fastest mobile processor in the world
today,” Huang said. The chip consumes 45 percent less power
than the older Tegra 3 model and more than doubles web-browsing
speeds, according to a statement.  The new portable game device will use Google Inc.’s Android
operating system, Huang said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
