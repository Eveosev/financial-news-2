Average temperatures in the U.S.
Northeast and Midwest may drop by at least 8 degrees Fahrenheit
(4.4 Celsius) in the second half of January.  Temperatures in the East Coast are forecast to return to
seasonal levels from Jan. 17 to Jan. 21 after falling from 8
degrees above normal from Jan. 7 to Jan. 16, according to Matt Rogers, president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  In the Midwest, temperatures that are now 8 degrees above
normal are expected to fall to about 3 to 5 degrees below the
usual, said Rogers, who’s based in Bethesda,  Maryland .  Upper-atmosphere weather patterns “will eventually give
these colder air masses and associated cold fronts more muscle
to push their way into the East and the rest of the South,”
Rogers said in a note to clients.  Energy traders look to long-range forecasts to gauge
potential fuel use. Below-normal temperatures in the large
cities of the Midwest and Northeast may increase demand for
energy to warm homes and businesses, boosting natural gas and
heating oil prices. About 50 percent of U.S. homes use natural
gas for heating.  In New York, the normal average temperature for Jan. 9 is
33 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in Gaithersburg,
Maryland. It’s 29 in  Boston ; 24 in Chicago; 32 in St. Louis; 53
in Houston; 19 in Calgary,  Alberta ; 42 in  Seattle ; and 55 in
 Burbank , California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
