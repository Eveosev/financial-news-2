Copper extended the biggest weekly
advance in more than a month as investors weighed rising
inventories in  China  and a jump in orders to move the metal out
of London Metal Exchange warehouses.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange climbed 0.2 percent to $8,099.75 a metric ton at 10:44
a.m. in  Shanghai , after climbing 2.5 percent last week, the
biggest advance since the week ended Nov. 30. Metal for April
delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was little changed at
58,390  yuan  ($9,375) a ton.  SHFE copper  inventories  added 1,685 tons to 206,458 tons
last week, the highest level in eight months, data based on 14
warehouses in Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces showed.
Orders to withdraw the metal from LME warehouses, or  canceled
warrants , jumped 43 percent to 71,575 tons on Jan. 4, the
highest since May 4.  “The data indicated last year’s trend of a drop in LME
stockpiles and a gain in China stockpiles continues,” said Fang Junfeng, an analyst at Shanghai CIFCO Futures Co. “Copper is
likely to trade in a narrow range around $8,000.”  Futures on the Comex in  New York  were little changed at
$3.6885 a pound. Net-long  positions , or wagers on rising prices,
held by funds rose to 15,924 futures and options contracts as of
Jan. 1 from 14,988 a week earlier, according to the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. On the LME, aluminum, zinc,
lead and nickel gained.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
