Czech industrial output fell more
than analysts forecast in November on declining production of
rubber and plastic goods.  Output decreased 3.9 percent from a year earlier, compared
with a 4.1 percent increase in October, the Czech Statistics
Office in  Prague  said in a statement on its website today. The
result was worse than the median forecast for a 1.1 percent drop
in a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts.  Production of rubber and plastic products declined 15.6
percent in November, contributing a 1 percentage point to the
fall of the overall figure, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
