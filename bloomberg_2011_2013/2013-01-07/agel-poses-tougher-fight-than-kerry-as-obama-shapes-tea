President  Barack Obama ’s anticipated nomination of Chuck Hagel as defense secretary poses a tougher confirmation fight for the former Republican senator within his own party than that faced by Obama’s choice for secretary of state, Democratic Senator  John Kerry .  Obama will introduce Hagel as his choice to head the Defense Department at an event today where he will also nominate White House counterterrorism adviser  John Brennan  as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said. The announcement is scheduled for 1:05 p.m.Washington time.  The prospect of Hagel as the nominee has already raised concerns among his onetime Republican colleagues in the Senate. “I’m going to vote for Senator Kerry,” Senator  Lindsey Graham , a South Carolina Republican, said on CNN’s “ State of the Union ” program. “I don’t agree with him a lot, but I think he’s very much in the mainstream of thought.”  Yet Hagel “is an in-your-face nomination,” said Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “This will be a controversial choice, and we’ll see where the votes go.”  The president formally offered the post to the former senator yesterday in a telephone call from the White House after returning from his family vacation in  Hawaii , according to an administration official who requested anonymity to discuss personnel matters.  Tough Questions  Hagel will be pressed on whether he is sufficiently supportive of Israel and tough on  Iran , if Obama goes forward with the nomination, Republicans said on the Sunday news shows.  Hagel, 66, has told friends he’s eager to tackle the job and is confident of confirmation. No one answered calls to his home or mobile phone yesterday amid scrutiny of the choice.  Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Hagel would face “a lot of tough questions,” while not ruling out his own support. “I’m going to wait and see how the hearings go and see whether Chuck’s views square with the job he would be nominated to do,” McConnell said on ABC’s “This Week.”  While the nomination of Hagel to succeed Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  represents an outreach across party lines for the president, Republican Senator  Ted Cruz  of Texas joined Graham on “Fox News Sunday” saying they are predisposed to oppose Hagel. Cruz, who was sworn in last week for his first term, said Hagel “advocated weakness with respect to our enemies.”  Investor’s View  Wall Street  would be “supportive” of a Hagel nomination,  Byron Callan , a defense industry analyst at Capital Alpha Partners LLC in Washington, said in an e-mail.  “Hagel has private sector experience and he’s well versed in defense policy and intelligence issues,” Callan said. A drawn out confirmation fight would be potentially damaging as the Defense Department budget comes under pressure again in March when the next round of negotiations over spending will be coming to a head, he said.  In turning to Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and 2004 presidential nominee, and Hagel, a Nebraska Republican, as he reshapes his national security team heading into a second term, Obama is elevating two decorated  Vietnam  War veterans who became opponents of the war in Iraq after their initial support in 2002. Kerry also returned from Vietnam to oppose that war.  Kerry would succeed Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton , and Senate Republicans have said they don’t expect him to face any significant confirmation challenge. The nomination of any Cabinet secretary requires confirmation of the Senate.  Hagel’s Critics  Hagel has been discussed as the leading candidate to lead the Pentagon for more than a month, and the prospect of his nomination has drawn opposition from an ad hoc coalition of Republican advocates of muscular defense policies, supporters of Israel and gay-rights activists.  He opposed the troop surge during the  Iraq war  under Republican President  George W. Bush , questioned unilateral economic sanctions against Iran and has called the  defense budget  “bloated.” Hagel also has come under fire for citing the influence of the “Jewish lobby” on behalf of Israel.  “Chuck Hagel’s opposition to Iranian sanctions and support for direct, unconditional talks with its leaders is both at odds with current U.S. policy and a threat to global security,” Republican Senator  John Cornyn  of Texas told the Daily Beast yesterday. “To make matters worse, he has called for direct negotiations with Hamas. The worst possible message we could send to our friend Israel and the rest of our allies in the Middle East is Chuck Hagel.”  Counter-Attack  Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S., the European Union and Israel.  Criticism of Hagel has drawn a counter-attack from a bipartisan group of former U.S. national security advisers -- James L. Jones, Brent Scowcroft,  Zbigniew Brzezinski  and Frank Carlucci.  “Hagel is a man of unshakable integrity and wisdom who has served his country in the most distinguished manner in peace and war,” they wrote in a letter published in the Washington Post on Dec. 25.  Obama defended Hagel in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” broadcast Dec. 30, saying there is nothing that would disqualify the former senator for the job.  “He’s a patriot, he’s somebody who has done extraordinary work in the United States Senate and somebody who served this country with valor in Vietnam,” Obama said, adding Hagel also “is somebody who is currently serving on my intelligence advisory board and doing an outstanding job.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Margaret Talev in Washington at  mtalev@bloomberg.net ;  Hans Nichols  in Washington at  hnichols2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Steven Komarow at  skomarow1@bloomberg.net
