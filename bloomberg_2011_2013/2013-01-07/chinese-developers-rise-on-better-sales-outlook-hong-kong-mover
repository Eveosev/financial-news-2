Chinese property shares rose in  Hong
Kong  trading after developers reported better December sales.  A  gauge  tracking property shares on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI) 
climbed 2 percent at the midday break, the most among five
industry groups on the benchmark. Three of the 10 best
performers on the  MSCI China Index (MXCN)  were Chinese developers.
 China Resources Land Ltd. (1109)  rose 3.2 percent to HK$24.25, set for
the highest since debut in 1996.  China Overseas Land &
Investment Ltd. (688)  jumped 2.6 percent to a 10-year high.  Developers reported better sales at the year-end even as
the government said it would maintain curbs on the property
market. Home sales volume in the capital city of Beijing rose 64
percent last year, the highest in three years, China Business
News reported today, citing local government data.  “Investors probably see the sales results as a good sign
that developers’ earnings are more secure than those in other
sectors,” Sylvia Wong, a Hong Kong-based property analyst at
UOB Kay Hian Ltd., said in a telephone interview today.  Cifi Holdings Group Co. (884)  rose 2.6 percent to the highest
since its public offering in November after announcing a 75
percent jump in full-year sales last year.  Evergrande Real
Estate Group Ltd. (3333) , China’s biggest developer by sales volume,
surged 4 percent to the highest in eight months.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
