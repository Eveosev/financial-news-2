In the news release  announcing his bill  to derail  the platinum coin effort ,
Republican Representative Greg Walden says something really stupid: “My wife and
I have owned and operated a small business since 1986. When it came time to pay
the bills, we couldn’t just mint a coin to create more money out of thin
air." Well, yeah, obviously the Waldens' company couldn't issue currency to pay its
bills, because issuing currency is a function of the federal government, not of
some random small business in  Oregon . There are all sorts of nonsensical statements you could offer with the same
structure. For example, why should we have a U.S. Marshals Service? After all,
when I ran a small business, we didn't just go around arresting fugitives who
were wanted for federal crimes. Or why should the federal government impose environmental regulations or
negotiate treaties with foreign countries? A small-business owner who tried to
do those things would end up looking really silly. The mistaken idea that federal economic policy should be driven by the same
internal logic as corporate or household budgeting has led to some of the worst
ideas of the last few years, such as that governments should respond to budget
deficits created by the economic cycle with tax increases and spending cuts. The federal government isn't a small business, and it has different purposes
and different constraints than small businesses do. Whether minting a platinum
coin is a good idea has nothing to do with how the Waldens balance the books at
their company. (Josh Barro is lead writer for the Ticker.  E-mail  him and  follow  him on
