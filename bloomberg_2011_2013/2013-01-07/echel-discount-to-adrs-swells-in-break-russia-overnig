Russia ’s stock market opened after a
six-day holiday with  OAO Mechel (MTL)  trading at the lowest level
versus New York in three years and OAO Novolipetsk Steel at the
biggest discount since 2008 to  London .  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. has rallied 3.5 percent since Dec.
28, the last day of 2012 trading on the Moscow Exchange. The

is the widest since Oct. 17, 2008. Global equity markets rallied
in the first week of 2013 as U.S. lawmakers agreed to a deal to
avert automatic spending cuts and tax increases. Crude, the
nation’s biggest export earner, increased to the highest price
since September.  “We have to see that jump up for Russia because it has to
basically catch up with the other equity markets,” Ilya Kravets, who helps manage $100 million of assets at Daniloff
Capital LLC, including Russian stocks, said by phone in New York
yesterday. “There are always internal issues with  Mechel (MTLR) , but
once you have these outside forces they can overpower a lot of
that. If we see significantly strong demand in coal then Mechel
would do really, really well.”  Rostelecom Leads  The Russia-US index slipped 1 percent to 101.28 yesterday,
the biggest decline since Dec. 21. The  Market Vectors Russia

will continue into 2013,  Murat Toprak , a strategist in London at

Bloomberg, said by phone on Jan. 4. The currency is set to gain

year was the best among the four major emerging nations.  Nickel Price  OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) , Russia’s largest lender, dropped 1.8 percent
