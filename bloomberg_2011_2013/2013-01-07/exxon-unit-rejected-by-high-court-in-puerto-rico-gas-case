The U.S. Supreme Court left intact a
$70 million award assessed against an  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  unit for
failing to comply with a  Puerto Rico  law governing gasoline
prices.  The justices today turned down an appeal from the oil
company’s Puerto Rico gasoline wholesaler, which said the award
in the consumer class-action lawsuit violates the Constitution.  The 1996 law was designed to ensure that wholesalers, in
the prices they charge to gas stations, account for the
expansion of fuel in warmer climates. The law requires
wholesalers to make a “temperature adjustment,” reducing the
price.  In its appeal, the Exxon unit said it had no way of
complying with the law until regulations implementing the
measure were adopted in 2005. The company said the
Constitution’s due process clause barred liability until those
regulations took effect.  The suing consumers said the regulations concerned prices
at the pump and didn’t affect the wholesalers’ obligation to
provide the temperature adjustment to retailers. The consumers
said the Exxon unit was receiving a windfall of 1.34 cents per
gallon before the law was enacted.  Puerto Rico’s  Supreme Court  let the award stand last year.  The case is Esso Standard Oil Co. (Puerto Rico) v. Trilla
Pinero, 12-445.  To contact the reporter on this story:
