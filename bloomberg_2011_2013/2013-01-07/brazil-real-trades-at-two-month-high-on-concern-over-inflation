Brazil ’s real traded at a two-month
high on speculation the central bank will allow it to gain
further to ease inflation concern.  The currency gained 0.2 percent to 2.0283 per  U.S. dollar 
at 11:35 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the strongest level on a closing
basis since Oct. 26. Swap rates due in January 2015 decreased
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.72 percent.  About 100 economists in a weekly central bank survey
published today raised their median inflation forecast for the
end of 2013 to 5.49 percent from 5.47 percent the week before.
The central bank strengthened the real in November by selling
currency swaps after it reached a three-year low.  “With the depreciation of the real, a yellow light has
come on,”  Francisco Carvalho , the head of currency at Liquidez
DTVM. “Inflation will continue to cause more concern in the
short term.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
