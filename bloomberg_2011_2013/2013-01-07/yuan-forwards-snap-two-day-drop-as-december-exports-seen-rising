China ’s  yuan  forwards snapped a two-
day decline before a report this week that may show exports from
Asia’s largest economy picked up last month.  Overseas sales rose 5 percent from a year earlier, compared
with a 2.9 percent increase in November, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey before data due Jan. 10. The
People’s Bank of China raised the reference rate by 0.04 percent
to 6.2872 per dollar. The yuan is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the daily fixing.  “There’s a little bit more optimism now compared to last
year when there were hard-landing concerns,” said Suan Teck Kin,
an economist at  United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB)  in Singapore. “So far
data is better, but not significantly better for the  renminbi  to
move in a big way.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.07 percent to
6.3185 per dollar as of 10:28 a.m. in Hong Kong, a 1.4 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts strengthened 0.21 percent last week.  The yuan gained 0.03 percent to 6.2285 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, held at 1.45 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In Hong Kong’s offshore
market, the yuan advanced 0.06 percent to 6.2120 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yuan is “unlikely” to appreciate “greatly” in
future as it is currently near a balanced level, according to a
commentary by People’s Bank of China officials including Sheng Songcheng, the head of the monetary authority’s statistics
department, published by China Finance on Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
