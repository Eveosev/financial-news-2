Rubber extended a rally to an eight-
month high after a U.S. jobs report signaled a recovery in the
world’s largest economy, boosting speculation demand will expand
for the commodity used to make tires.  Rubber for delivery in June climbed as much as 1.9 percent
to 313.7 yen a kilogram ($3,563 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange, the highest since May 7. Futures traded at
310 yen at 10:40 a.m., extending this year’s gain to 2.5 percent.  U.S. employers added workers in December at about the same
pace as in the prior month even as lawmakers struggled to reach
a budget deal, the Labor Department’s monthly payrolls report
showed Jan. 4. The report helped the dollar advance to the
highest level since July 2010 against the Japanese currency,
raising the appeal of yen-denominated contracts.  “The U.S. data added to optimism about economic recovery
and raw-material demand growth,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst
at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  The yen traded near a 2 1/2 year low against the dollar
amid speculation that  Japan ’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will
ramp up efforts to spur growth, paring demand for refuge assets.
The yen traded at 87.97 per dollar after touching 88.41 on Jan.
4, the weakest since July 2010.  Rubber for delivery in May added 0.3 percent to 26,440  yuan 
($4,245) a ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange. Natural-rubber
inventories gained 1,770 tons to 97,697 tons, the highest since
March 2010, the bourse said on Jan. 4, based on a survey of nine
warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin.  Thai rubber free-on-board advanced for a seventh day on Jan.
4, rising 1.2 percent to 102.10 baht ($3.35) a kilogram,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
