Mercuria Energy Trading SA hired Mike Harrison as a copper trader, three people with direct knowledge
of the matter said.  Harrison will be based in  London , said the people, who
didn’t want to be named because the information hasn’t been made
public. Harrison, previously a physical copper trader at
Standard Bank Plc, starts work with Mercuria in March, two of
the people said.  Erik Larsen, a spokesman for Standard Bank in Johannesburg,
wasn’t immediately available for comment. Paul Chivers and
Sophie Caverzasio, spokespeople for Mercuria, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
