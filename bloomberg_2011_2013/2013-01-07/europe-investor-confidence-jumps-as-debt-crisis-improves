European investor confidence
increased for a fifth month in January as signs that the
region’s debt crisis is easing multiplied, the Sentix research
institute said today.  An  index  measuring sentiment in the euro-area economy
advanced to minus 7 from minus 16.8 in December, the Limburg,
Germany-based institute said in an e-mailed statement. That is
the highest level since July 2011. Economists had forecast a
gain to minus 14.2, according to the median of 12 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. A gauge of economic expectations climbed
to 12 from minus 1.5, while a measure of current conditions rose
to minus 24.3 from minus 31, Sentix said.  The  European Central Bank ’s pledge last year to buy
unlimited government bonds of countries signing up to reform
plans has damped expectations that the euro area would break up.
Since then,  Greece  has secured further aid needed to prevent
default and the region’s leaders have agreed a plan for greater
financial-market coordination.  “That the improvement in the index has been so strong is
partly down to many small improvements in the euro area such as
Greece’s successful debt buyback,” said  Sebastian Wanke , an
economist at Sentix. “On the other hand, the U.S. has avoided
falling over the fiscal cliff, and that is reflected in the
indexes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
