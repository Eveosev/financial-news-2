International Consolidated Airlines
Group Plc (IAG)  boosted traffic 2.6 percent last year as growth at
British Airways offset a decline at Spanish unit Iberia, buoyed
by demand for trans-Atlantic travel and the takeover of BMI.  Traffic, or the number of passengers carried multiplied by
the distance flown, rose 7.7 percent at British Airways, or 5.2
percent excluding the impact of buying BMI, while slumping 3.1
percent at Iberia, London-based IAG said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Willie Walsh , who led the merger
that formed Europe’s third-largest airline in 2011, is seeking a
600 million-euro ($786 million) turnaround in earnings at Iberia
by 2015. IAG is following Air France-KLM Group and  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  in cutting jobs as Spanish operations are hurt by
an economic slump and competition from discount operators.  “There is continued firmness in trends at British Airways
and weakness in Spanish markets,” the company said today. IAG
cut capacity 3.3 percent at Iberia last year to help cope with
the decline, while adding 5.4 percent more seats at BA.  IAG  shares fell  as much as 1.8 percent and were trading 1.6
percent lower at 191.90 pence as of 3:54 p.m. in London.  BA and Iberia collectively carried 54.6 million people in
2012, up 5.6 percent from a year earlier. All regions other than
Africa the  Middle East  and south  Asia  posted growth, while the
overall  load factor  climbed by 1.2 points to 80.3 percent.  Iberia’s ground staff, cabin crew and pilots last month
agreed to negotiate terms of a restructuring plan, calling off
strikes planned for the holiday period.  IAG’s traffic figures include discount unit Iberia Express
while excluding BMIbaby, which was closed down in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
