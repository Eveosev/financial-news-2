Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed on speculation that the cost of producing the biofuel
will increase with rising prices for corn.  The grain-based additive was 57.24 cents a gallon cheaper
than gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts for both
commodities. That compares with 59.43 cents Jan. 4.  “It’s not cheap to make,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at
Price Futures Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 2.4 cents, or
1.1 percent, to settle at $2.205 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade.  Gasoline for February delivery climbed 1.31 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.7774 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.235 a gallon and on the West Coast at $2.34, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in  New York  dropped 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.265 a gallon and in Chicago the additive decreased 1.5 cents
to $2.165.  A U.S. Agriculture Department report to be released Jan. 11
may show that corn inventories as of Dec. 1 were down 15 percent
from a year earlier to the lowest level since 2003, according to
a survey of 31 analysts by  Bloomberg News .  Flynn said ethanol plants may see higher costs if the
report shows tightening U.S. supply for the grain.  Corn for March delivery jumped 5.25 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $6.855 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 27 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged
from Jan. 4, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The
figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that
can be fed to livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
