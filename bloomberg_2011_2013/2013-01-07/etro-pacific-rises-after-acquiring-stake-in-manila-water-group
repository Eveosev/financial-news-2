Metro Pacific Investments Co. (MPI)  reached
its highest since September 2009 in Philippine trading after
agreeing to acquire a 39 percent stake in  Manila Water 
Consortium Inc., which runs a Cebu province water venture.  The bulk water supply project is a public-private
partnership project between the provincial government of Cebu
and two of the country’s largest conglomerates.  Metro Pacific said in an exchange disclosure that  Manila
Water (MWC)  will hold 51 percent, MetroPac 39 percent and Vicsal
Development Corp. 10 percent once the Securities and Exchange
Commission approves the group’s proposed capital stock increase.
Metro Pacific said it signed an agreement with Manila Water Co.
Inc. to buy 128.7 million shares in Manila Water Consortium.  The infrastructure holding company operates water
utilities, tolls and power distribution facilities and invests
in real estate and other projects. At 5.06 pesos, MPI shares
closed yesterday at their highest in more than three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
