Boston Celtics guard Rajon Rondo will
miss tonight’s game at the  New York Knicks  after being suspended
one game by the  National Basketball Association  for making
contact with a referee.  Stu Jackson, the NBA’s executive vice president for
basketball operations, said today in an e-mailed release that
Rondo was suspended without pay for touching the official during
an 89-81 victory at the Atlanta Hawks yesterday and failure to
cooperate with a league investigation.  The Celtics (16-17) have won two straight games heading
into tonight’s contest against the Knicks (23-10) at Madison
Square Garden.  Rondo, 26, was suspended for two games in November for
starting a fight that spilled into the stands during a home loss
to the Brooklyn Nets. He also was suspended a game during last
season’s playoffs for bumping an official.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
