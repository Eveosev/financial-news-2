Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  hired an executive
from  MGM Resorts International (MGM)  to head a new development
division, signaling it wants to build casinos at a faster pace.  Gamal Aziz will serve as president and chief operating
officer of Wynn Resorts Development LLC, Wynn Resorts said in a
statement today. The company, headed by billionaire Stephen Wynn, didn’t provide a start date for the appointment.  “Our activities in North America and Cotai require that
the company expand its leadership,” Wynn said in the statement.
Aziz “will give us a tremendous boost as we begin 2013,” the
Las Vegas-based company said.  Cotai is a piece of reclaimed land in Macau, the only place
in  China  where casino gambling is legal, that is being developed
into Asia’s equivalent of the Las Vegas Strip. Wynn Resorts,
founded in 2002, owns casinos in Las Vegas and Macau and
received approval last year for a resort in Cotai.  Wynn Resorts has submitted a proposal for a casino in
Philadelphia and is expected to pursue one in  Massachusetts 
after abandoning its first site there last year, according to
Michael Weaver, a company spokesman.  Aziz headed a division at MGM that pursued hotel
developments around the world since 2007. Earlier, he worked
with Stephen Wynn at what was then called Mirage Resorts.  Wynn added 1.2 percent to $120.78 on Jan. 4 in New York.
The shares advanced 1.8 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
