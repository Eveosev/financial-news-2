Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., a
Chinese solar manufacturer, expects 2012 panel shipments of more
than 2.2 gigawatts.  That exceeds an earlier forecast of 2.1 gigawatts to 2.2
gigawatts, the Baoding, China-based company said today in a
statement. At that volume, Yingli expects to become the world’s
largest panel maker.  “According to public data to date, we believe Yingli has
evolved into the largest PV module supplier,” Chief Executive
Officer Miao Liansheng said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
