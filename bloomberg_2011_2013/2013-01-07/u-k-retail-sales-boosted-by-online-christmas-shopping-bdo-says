U.K. retail sales rose in December on
a surge of customers during the weekend before Christmas day
increased online shopping, according to a survey by BDO LLP.  Like-for-like sales climbed by 1.9 percent in the five
weeks through Dec. 29, BDO said in its High Street Sales Tracker
report released today. The data includes companies with annual
revenue between 5 million pounds ($7.8 million) and 500 million
pounds.  Online purchases gained the most of any type, rising 30.9
percent, as flexible delivery options attracted buyers, while
sales at fashion stores were little changed. Footfall overall
rose 22 percent on the weekend before Christmas from a year ago.  “This year, there has been a clear focus on protecting
margins,”  Don Williams , BDO’s national head of retail and
wholesale, said in the statement. “By building up to Christmas
early in a planned and measured way, there has been less knee-
jerk discounting. At the same time, consumers are continuing to
feel the pinch of hard economic conditions and are being much
more careful about when and where they spend their money.”  Retailers are relying on Christmas sales to help rescue a
year when high unemployment and the  European debt crisis  have
blighted spending. Many store owners offered discounts online on
Christmas Day, when Britons made a record 107 million visits to
retail websites, up 86 percent from 2011, according to credit-
reporting service Experian Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
