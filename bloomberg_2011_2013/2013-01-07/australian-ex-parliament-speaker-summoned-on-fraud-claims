Australia ’s former Parliamentary
Speaker  Peter Slipper  has been ordered to appear in court next
month in relation to three fraud charges, federal police said.  He has been ordered to appear in Canberra Magistrates Court
on Feb. 15, in relation to three offenses of “dishonestly
causing a risk of a loss to the Commonwealth,” the Australian
Federal Police said in a  statement  today on its website.  Slipper was initially accused by a former aide of misusing
taxpayer-funded travel vouchers as part of a sexual harassment
complaint that was thrown out by a judge last month. There was
no answer at Slipper’s office at Parliament House and the former
speaker didn’t immediately answer an e-mailed request for
comment on the summonses.  Slipper resigned from the speaker’s post in October after
 text messages  containing crude comments about women were made
public during the sexual harassment claim proceedings. The
matter has proved a distraction for Prime Minister  Julia
Gillard ’s minority government, which has relied on Slipper to
boost its numbers in the lower house of parliament.  Formal charges won’t be laid until Slipper appears in court
and he will be given an opportunity then to enter a plea, police
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
