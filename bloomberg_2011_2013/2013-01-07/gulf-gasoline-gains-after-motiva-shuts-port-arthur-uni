Gasoline strengthened on the U.S.
 Gulf Coast  after Motiva Enterprises LLC shut a 325,000-barrel-a-
day crude unit at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery.  The crude unit, which is the largest of three at the
refinery, shut after a small leak took place at about 2 p.m.
yesterday, said Kimberly Windon, a Houston-based spokeswoman for
the refinery. The company was attempting to restart the section
after it closed for repairs following its May debut.  The most recent startup began Jan. 3, said a person
familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified
because he is not authorized to speak for the company.  Reformulated gasoline  to be blended with ethanol on the
Gulf Coast gained 1.5 cents to trade at 8 cents a gallon below
futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:04 p.m. CBOB,
or conventional, 85-octane gasoline, rose 2 cents to 13 cents
below futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region dropped
0.38 cent to a discount of 2.63 cents versus heating oil
futures.  Following yesterday’s leak, Motiva’s crude unit was put on
circulation, according to the person. When on circulation, the
unit is kept running but no oil is processed.  Motiva is a refining and marketing joint venture of Saudi
Refining Inc., a subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., and Shell
Oil Co., a unit of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDS/A)   To contact the reporter on this story:
