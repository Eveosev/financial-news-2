AS Estonian Air and its pilots union
reached a collective-bargaining agreement, averting a strike as
the national carrier seeks government help to stay in business.  The Tallinn-based company and Estonian Airline Pilots’
Association signed the accord today after it was approved by the
company’s board, the two parties said in a joint e-mailed
statement. The pilots’ association canceled a strike due to
start today after signing the agreement, which expires in
February 2014.  Estonian Air, which has lost money since 2006, said in
November it would reduce its headcount and destinations by about
half after the nine-month loss almost doubled to 20 million
euros ($26 million). The pilots announced the job action last
month as talks on an agreement remained deadlocked.  “The management can continue their work to restructure
Estonian Air,” Chairman Erkki Raasuke said in the statement.  A strike might have led to “massive” losses for the
company and a bankruptcy, Postimees newspaper cited Chief
Executive Jan Palmer as saying on Jan. 3.  The carrier’s management hasn’t presented a viable business
plan to the government yet, Prime Minister Andrus Ansip said on
Jan. 3. The government is holding talks with the European
Commission on whether state aid can be offered to the company,
he said the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
