Taiwan  dollar forwards strengthened
for the first time in four days on optimism an improvement in
the U.S. economy will boost demand for the island’s exports.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 155,000 in December, more

showed Jan. 4. Taiwanese exports jumped 9 percent last month
from a year earlier, following a 0.9 percent increase in
November, the Ministry of Finance said today.  One-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.2 percent to
NT$28.97 per dollar as of 4:10 p.m. in Taipei, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts are at a 0.5 percent
premium to the spot rate, which was little changed at NT$29.125,
based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices.  “Looks like the U.S. economy is improving,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at  Union Bank of
Taiwan. (2838)  “The central bank will continue to maintain the
stability of the Taiwan dollar.”  The monetary authority has bought the greenback to counter
gains in the island’s currency on most days in the past nine
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified. The
central bank’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate
stability and to intervene in the event of abnormal moves,
Governor Perng Fai-Nan said Dec. 19.  Inflation Accelerates  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a gauge
