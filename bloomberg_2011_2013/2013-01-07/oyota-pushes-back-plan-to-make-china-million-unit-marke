Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  pushed back plans
to make  China  its third million-unit market until after this
year as Asia’s biggest carmaker waits for anti- Japan  sentiment
to subside and demand to return to normal.  The maker of Camry sedans, which as recently as September
forecast China sales would reach 1 million in 2012, said today
it expects deliveries in the country to rise about 7 percent to
900,000 vehicles in 2013 after they fell 4.9 percent last year.
Sales in December dropped 16 percent to 90,800, the sixth
straight monthly decline, the company said in a text message.  Toyota and other Japanese automakers have increased
discounts and extended guarantees to win back customers after
violent demonstrations broke out in major cities across China in
September over a territorial dispute between Asia’s two biggest
economies.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  also reported
annual sales declines in the country today.  “China is the world’s biggest car market, so we need to do
our best to sell our cars there,”  Akio Toyoda , Toyota’s
president, told reporters in Tokyo today.  Toyota sold 840,500 vehicles in China last year, the first
annual drop based on company figures stretching back to 2002.
Nissan and Honda reported declines of 24 percent and 19 percent,
respectively, in December China sales, bringing full-year
deliveries to 1.18 million and 598,576 vehicles.  Recovering Market  “The Chinese market is recovering,” Toshiyuki Shiga,
chief operating officer at Nissan, said in Tokyo today. The
company, which reported a 5.3 percent drop in 2012 China sales,
hopes demand will return to normal after the Lunar New Year in
February, he said.  Honda’s sales in China have rebounded to about 70 percent
to 80 percent of normal levels and may take longer than until
the Lunar New Year to recover fully, Fumihiko Ike, chief
financial officer at Honda, said today in  Tokyo .  “It’s looking like the roots are rather deep,” Ike said.
Honda reported deliveries in China fell 3.1 percent in 2012.  Toyota fell 1.8 percent to close at 4,185 yen in Tokyo
before the announcement. The stock gained 56 percent last year,
compared with the 23 percent advance in the benchmark Nikkei 255
Stock Average. Honda declined 1.2 percent and Nissan slid 0.4
percent today.  Toyota sells more than 1 million vehicles a year in the
U.S. and Japan, its two largest markets.  GAC Toyota Motor Co., a Toyota joint venture in China,
pledged to waive punitive measures imposed on dealerships for
failing to meet sales targets in the wake of the demonstrations
and subsequent plunge in demand.  Effective Measures  “Sales of Toyota and other Japanese carmakers have shown
clear signs of recovery since October,” said Vivien Chan, a
Hong Kong-based analyst at Oriental Patron Holdings, who
predicts deliveries will normalize around the second quarter of
this year. “The measures they took after the protests have
proven to the very effective.”  Japanese automakers may suffer production cuts into 2014
and lose a combined 650,000 units in vehicle output if tensions
don’t abate between the two countries, according to estimates by
IHS Automotive, an industry researcher.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
