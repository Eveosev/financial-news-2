The euro is poised to strengthen to
an eight-month high of $1.3309 after staying above a key
technical level, according to Credit Suisse Group AG, citing
trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency is set to reverse last week’s 1.1
percent decline after remaining above $1.2985, the 50 percent
retracement of its advance from $1.2662 on Nov. 13 to $1.3308 on
Dec. 19, strategists at the company wrote in a note to clients,
citing so-called Fibonacci analysis.  “The focus is shifting higher once more and we envisage a
recovery,” the analysts including Cilline Bain in  London  wrote
in the research note. “We expect a rebound.”  The euro weakened 0.2 percent to $1.3042 at 12:26 p.m.
London time after falling to $1.2998 on Jan. 4, the lowest level
since Dec. 12. The last time the single currency traded at
$1.3309 was April 3.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance or below support indicates a currency may
move to the next level.  Resistance refers to an area on a price graph where
analysts anticipate sell orders to be clustered. Support is
where there may be orders to buy.  In  technical analysis , investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a security, currency
or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
