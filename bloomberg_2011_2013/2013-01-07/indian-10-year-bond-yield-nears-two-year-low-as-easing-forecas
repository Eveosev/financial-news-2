India ’s 10-year bonds rose, pushing
the yield to a two-year low, on speculation the central bank
will reduce  interest rates  this quarter to boost growth.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.90 percent in
Mumbai, the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year security since
Dec. 28, 2010, according to the central bank’s trading system.  The  Reserve Bank of India  will lower the repurchase  rate  by
50 basis points to 7.5 percent by the end of the first quarter
after holding it since April, according to 11 of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Seven see a 25 basis point reduction.
Credit Suisse AG predicts a 50 basis point decrease at the next
review on Jan. 29, and a further 75 basis points of cuts by the
end of July, it said in a research note released today.  “If our forecasts are correct, we can look forward to a
further rally in local-currency sovereign bonds,” Robert Prior- Wandesforde, a Singapore-based economist at Credit Suisse, wrote
in the note. “The 10-year yield is likely to fall to at least
as low as 7.5 percent” by mid-year, he predicted.  The government cut its estimate for economic growth in the
year through March to as little as 5.7 percent, the least in a
decade, on Dec. 17.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao said a day later that policy makers’ focus needs to
shift toward supporting the economy from curbing inflation.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point to 7.60 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
