Forbes Family Trust, the multifamily
office started by the Forbes family and others, agreed to a
strategic partnership with LGL Partners to share resources such
as investment advisory and philanthropic planning.  LGL’s P. Scott Gregorchuk joins New York-based Forbes
Family Trust as chief executive officer and William D. Luterman
becomes chief investment officer, according to a statement
released today. LGL will take a stake in Forbes Family Trust,
Miguel Forbes, vice chairman of Forbes Family Trust, said in an
e-mail.  “The Forbes family carries one of the most respected names
in free market capitalism around the world,” Gregorchuk said in
the statement. “By combining our resources, we believe we can
provide clients with world-class capabilities.”  Forbes Family Trust was formed in 2009 to manage the money
of the Forbes family, which founded its namesake magazine, and
to advise other wealthy individuals and families. The combined
business will oversee more than $1 billion under management,
according to Miguel Forbes.  LGL, based in Philadelphia, developed out of the family
office created by Brook J. Lenfest to handle the Lenfest
family’s investments, finances and philanthropy after it sold
closely held Lenfest Communications to  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
