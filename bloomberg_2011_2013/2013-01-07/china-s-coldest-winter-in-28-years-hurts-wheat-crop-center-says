The coldest winter in 28 years in
 China , the world’s largest wheat producer, may hamper the
developing winter crop, according the official China National
Grain and Oils Information Center.  Southern China will be hit by a new cold front this week,
with temperatures dropping to as low as minus 5 degrees Celsius
(23 degrees Fahrenheit) on Jan. 11 and 12, the China
Meteorological Administration said in a statement today. Guizhou
and Hunan provinces may experience snowstorms, it said.  Widespread snowfall and lower temperatures since Jan. 2
have affected crops in southern growing regions and along the
Huai River, CNGOIC said in an e-mailed report, without giving an
estimate on crop damage. Winter wheat usually accounts for about
90 percent of the country’s output, according to Ma Wenfeng, a
grains analyst at Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultant Ltd.  “So far the general growing condition in the winter-wheat
areas remains good and snowfalls are usually beneficial for
wheat,” Masaid by phone today. “But a drought coupled with
low temperatures will hamper growth.”  Two people died and 770,000 people have been affected by
record-low temperatures and snow in  Inner Mongolia  in northern
China, Xinhua said yesterday, citing the local government. More
than 260,000 people are in need of emergency aid and about
180,000 head of livestock have died, according to the report.  Wheat futures traded in  Zhengzhou  gained 0.8 percent to
2,592  yuan  ($416) a metric ton at 2:24 p.m. in Shanghai, and
jumped 13 percent in 2012. The grain in Chicago rose 0.8 percent
to $7.53 a bushel after climbing 19 percent last year.  “Last year China by and large had a pretty good wheat
harvest as we estimated output of 117 million tons,” Ma said,
adding that government data showed a record 120 million tons.  China will produce 120.6 million tons in the 2012-2013
season, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimated in December.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
