Swaps prices rose a second day for
thermal coal from  Indonesia , the world’s largest exporter of the
fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the second
quarter climbed 10 cents yesterday to $64.95 a metric ton on a
net-as-received basis on Jan. 4, Ginga said in an e-mail today.
The February contract advanced 10 cents to $64 a ton.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the
second quarter held at $86.20 a ton on a net-as-received basis,
the energy broker said. The February contract was unchanged at
$85.20 a ton.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period. About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is
classified as sub-bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower
carbon content reduce the heating value compared with better-
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has fewer than 6,100 kilocalories
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
