Wheat futures rose on speculation
that farmers will abandon more of their winter crop than usual
amid lingering drought in the U.S., the world’s top exporter.  As much as 25 percent of hard red winter wheat may not be
harvested after the most-severe drought since the 1930s killed
plants, Mark Hodges, the executive director of Plains Grains
Inc. in Stillwater,  Oklahoma , said last week. The Department of
Agriculture will announce planting estimates on Jan. 11.  “The winter wheat-seeding number is generally expected to
be higher” than last year,  Jeff McReynolds , the owner of
McReynolds Marketing & Investments in Hays,  Kansas , said in a
telephone interview. “If the weather pattern doesn’t change,
abandonment will be up.”  Wheat futures gained 0.5 percent to settle at $7.5125 a
bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Last week, the
price slumped 4 percent, the fifth straight decline and the
longest slump since October 2011, amid signs of declining U.S.
exports.  On Jan. 4, the price closed at $7.4725, down more than 20
percent from $9.4325 on July 20, the highest settlement since
April 9, 2008. That signaled the start of a bear market.  In 2012, wheat gained 19 percent, the most among the 24  raw
materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
