Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s
biggest seller of smartphones, said it will offer its first
Windows Phone 8 models in the U.S. in the coming weeks.  The company will sell the ATIV Odyssey, which runs on
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows Phone 8 operating system, through
Verizon Wireless, Samsung said today at the  Consumer Electronics
Show  in Las Vegas.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  also plans to introduce a
Samsung Windows Phone 8 handset by summer, as well as one from
 HTC Corp. (2498) , according to a separate statement.  For Samsung, offering Windows phones helps decrease its
reliance on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system, used on many
of its best-selling devices. Microsoft, meanwhile, is trying to
turn the software into a bigger rival to both Android and  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone.  The ATIV Odyssey has a 4-inch touch-screen and a 1.5-
gigahertz processor, and can run on networks that use the speedy
long-term evolution standard, Samsung said.  Sprint didn’t give the names of the Samsung or HTC models
it was releasing. The carrier ranks third in the U.S. in mobile-
phone customers, behind No. 1 Verizon and No. 2  AT&T Inc. (T)   To contact the reporter on this story:
