China Windpower Group Ltd. (182)  fell the
most in almost 14 months in  Hong Kong  trading as the wind
developer said it had a “significant drop” in 2012 profit.  The stock plunged as much as 9 percent to 30 Hong Kong
cents for its the biggest intraday decrease since Oct. 20, 2011,
after the company said Jan. 4 a decline in earnings from selling
stakes in wind farms and from power generated by companies where
it’s a joint owner of the project are behind the drop in net
income, without giving more information. It plans to announce
full-year earnings in March.  The growth of  China ’s wind-power industry slowed after the
government tightened approvals of projects starting in 2011 to
ease grid congestion. Installations in 2012 may have fallen 20
percent to 16.4 gigawatts, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance.  “Grid curtailment was very serious in the first half of
2012, depressing wind-power operators as the growth in demand
for electricity slowed and project approvals became harder,”
said Jerry Weng, a Shanghai-based analyst at KGI Securities Co.
“The situation is expected to get better this year.”  China Windpower shares traded 4.6 percent lower to 31 Hong
Kong cents as of the midday trading break. The benchmark  Hang
Seng  index rose 0.1 percent.  The Hong Kong-based company’s first-half profit dropped 90
percent to HK$24.8 million ($3.2 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
