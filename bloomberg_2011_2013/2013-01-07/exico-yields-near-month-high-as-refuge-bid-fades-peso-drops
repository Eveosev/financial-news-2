Mexican bond yields linked to
consumer prices held near a seven-month high before a government
report forecast to show inflation slowed last month to within
the central bank’s target range.  Yields on Udibonos due in December fell less than one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.05 percent at 4 p.m. in
Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Yesterday’s closing level of 1.06 percent was the highest since
May 23. The peso slid 0.2 percent today to 12.7683 per dollar.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.76 percent in December from
4.18 percent in the prior month, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the national
statistics agency’s Jan. 9 report. The last time the rate of
consumer price increases was within the central bank’s 2 percent
to 4 percent target for an entire month was in May. Inflation
slowed to 3.76 percent in the first half of December, the
government reported Dec. 21.  “The effects are being most seen in the shorter part of
the curve,”  Mario Copca , a currency and fixed-income strategist
at Metanalisis SA in Mexico City, said in a phone interview.  Yields on fixed-rated peso bonds due in 2024 fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.51 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.14 centavo to
139.16 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
