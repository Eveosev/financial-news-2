The shekel weakened to the lowest
level in three weeks as the dollar strengthened on bets the U.S.
Federal Reserve may end its monthly bond purchases this year,
boosting demand for the greenback.  The shekel weakened for a third day, dropping 0.3 percent
to 3.7848 per dollar as of 11:08 a.m. in Tel Aviv. The currency
earlier slipped as much as 0.5 percent to 3.7926, the weakest
level since Dec. 17. The slide in the shekel tracks a rise in
the  Dollar Index (DXY)  for a fourth day before Richmond Federal
Reserve President  Jeffrey Lacker  speaks tomorrow in Columbia,
 South Carolina . Minutes released last week of the U.S. central
bank’s latest meeting showed policy makers may curtail monetary
stimulus this year.  “It’s the Fed effect,” said Moshe Nir, a trader at
Mercantile Discount Bank Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “The shekel is
having a steady decline against the dollar after the Fed
announced it may slow debt-purchases.  Israel  naturally gets
strongly impacted by these trends in the dollar.”  After its December meeting, the Fed announced Treasury
purchases of $45 billion a month in addition to $40 billion a
month of mortgage-debt purchases begun in September. “Several”
members of the policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  said
it would “probably be appropriate to slow or stop purchases
well before the end of 2013,” according to minutes of their
Dec. 11-12 meeting released last week.  Bonds fell for a second day, sending the yield on the 5.5
percent Mimshal Shiklit notes due in January 2022 two basis
points higher, or 0.2 percentage point, to 3.79 percent, the
highest level since Dec. 19. The yield is gaining after an eight
basis-point advance in the 10-year Treasury note on Jan. 3 also
after Fed policy makers said they will probably end monthly bond
purchases in 2013.  The U.S., along with the European Union, is Israel’s
largest trading partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
