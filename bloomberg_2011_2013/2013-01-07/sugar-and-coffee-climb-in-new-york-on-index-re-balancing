Sugar and coffee futures rose on
speculation that investment funds tracking commodity indexes
will increase their holdings. Cocoa and cotton also advanced,
while orange juice dropped.  Investors will probably buy 31,451 contracts of raw sugar
and 11,148 lots of arabica coffee as weightings shift for the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI and Dow Jones-UBS Commodity gauges,
Morgan Stanley estimates. That may bring inflows of $1.5 billion
to the sugar, coffee, cocoa and cotton markets, the New York-
based bank said today in a report.  As the weightings shift this month, “one would think we
should at least see some stability” for prices,  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at Newedge Group in  New York ,
said in a report.  Sugar for March delivery gained 0.1 percent to settle at
18.86 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
the first increase in three sessions. The price fell 16 percent
last year.  Coffee futures for March delivery rose 2.1 percent to
$1.504 a pound, the second straight gain.  Cocoa futures for March delivery jumped 2.1 percent to
$2,267 a metric ton, the biggest increase for a most-active
contract since Dec. 12.  Processing in  Europe , the world’s top consuming region,
probably fell 4 percent last quarter, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 12 traders. That compares with
declines of 16 percent in the third quarter and 18 percent in
second. The European Cocoa Association will publish its latest
figures on Jan. 15.  “People are buying ahead of the grinding numbers, which
might show improvement,” Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank
International in  London , said in a telephone interview.  Cotton futures for March delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
75.71 cents a pound in New York.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery slumped 2.1 percent
to $1.106 a pound. Earlier, the price touched $1.105, the lowest
since Nov. 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
