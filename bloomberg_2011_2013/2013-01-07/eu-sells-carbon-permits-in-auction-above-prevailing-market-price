The European Union sold carbon
permits in an auction for more than the prevailing market price
for the first time in more than six weeks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The bloc sold 3.5 million metric tons of permits at 6.18
euros ($8.06) a ton in an auction hosted by European Energy
Exchange AG. Day-ahead futures for Phase 3 permits eligible
through 2020 were bid at 6.12 euros and offered at 6.21 euros on
 London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange at 10 a.m. in London, when
the sale ended.  It’s the first time the auction price has been more than
the prompt cost since Nov. 23. The differential between the two
may be considered by traders as a signal of market demand.  There were bids for a total of 9.2 million tons in the
auction, 2.6 times the number of permits for sale, according to
data on the EEX website. That so-called cover ratio is above the
most recent sales carried out in December, and below the average
2.8 ratio for all sales of Phase 3 permits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
