Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Japan ’s largest
manufacturer, issued $1.5 billion of bonds in two parts,
including its first 10-year dollar securities in about a year.  The maker of the Prius and Corolla automobiles sold $800
million of 1.375 percent, five-year notes to yield 60 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $700 million of
2.625 percent, 10-year debt at a relative yield of 80 basis
points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company sold dollar bonds in October 2012, issuing $1.5
billion of 1.25 percent, five-year notes to yield 65 basis
points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. The bonds
traded at 100.1 cents on the dollar to yield 1.22 percent on
Jan. 4, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Toyota sold $1 billion of 3.3 percent 10-year securities in
January 2012 that traded at 109.7 cents on the dollar to yield
2.12 percent on Dec. 21, Trace data show.  The new bonds may be rated Aa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service, according to a person familiar with the transaction,
who asked not to be identified citing lack of authorization to
speak publicly.  Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and
Royal Bank of Canada managed the sale for the Aichi, Japan-based
company, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
