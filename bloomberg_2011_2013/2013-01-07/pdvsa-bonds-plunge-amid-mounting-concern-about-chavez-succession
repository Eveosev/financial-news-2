Bonds of  Petroleos de Venezuela SA ,
the state oil company, plunged the most in six months amid
concern that there will be a succession crisis if President Hugo
Chavez is unable to be sworn for a third term on Jan. 10.  PDVSA’s debt due 2017 plunged 1.88 cents to 99.09 cents on
the dollar at 4:30 p.m. in New York. The $6.15 billion of
securities yield 8.73 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The notes were the most actively traded emerging market
corporate bonds today, according to Trace, the bond price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Chavez, who was re-elected in October, has remained in Cuba
since Dec. 11 as he suffered complications following a fourth
surgery related to an undisclosed form of cancer. The socialist
president’s political opponents contend that he must return to
 Venezuela  for his Jan. 10 swearing-in ceremony or be declared
ineligible to govern. Allies say they are using his illness to
plot a coup.  “There’s definitely uncertainty with how things will play
out with the looming January inauguration date,” Kathryn Rooney Vera, a strategist at Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami, said in
a telephone interview. “There’s concern in the market there
will be internal strife with regard to the date.”  PDVSA’s bonds rallied 22.61 cents last year amid
speculation a change in leadership would open Venezuela, South
America’s top producer, to foreign investment and stem declining
output. The country has the world’s largest crude reserves,
totaling about 300 billion barrels, according to the BP
Statistical Review of World Energy.  Output has fallen  to about
2.8 million barrels a day from 3.1 million barrels a day when
Chavez took office in 1999. Oil accounts for 95 percent of
exports.  Yields on the country’s benchmark 2027 bonds jumped 29
basis points, or 0.29 percentage points, today to 9.06 percent,
