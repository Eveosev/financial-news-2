Job vacancies at  London  financial-
services companies fell by more than a third last year as banks
cut staff in response to tighter regulation and weaker
securities markets, recruitment firm  Astbury Marsden  said.  New vacancies in the British capital’s City and Canary
Wharf financial districts dipped 35 percent to 35,115 in 2012,
down from 54,025 in 2011, the London-based recruiter said in a
statement today. There were about 800 new City jobs available in
December, compared with about 1,490 in the same month in 2011,
the recruiter said.  “Tighter regulation, including higher  capital
requirements , forced up costs at a time when revenues dipped due
to factors including a continued weak economy and less trading
activity,” said  Mark Cameron , chief operating officer at
Astbury Marsden in London. “Senior management in banks took
very decisive action and implemented major structural changes,
including winding down entire units.”  Securities firms have been shedding staff to reduce costs
as the debt crisis curbed trading and stock and bond offerings
slumped. Citigroup Inc., whose European investment-banking
headquarters is based in London, said last month it will cut
about 11,000 jobs globally.  UBS AG (UBSN)  announced it’s eliminating
10,000 jobs, about 15 percent of the workforce, over three years
as it dismantles parts of its investment bank.  “Hopefully, we are now behind the worst of the cost-
cutting,” Cameron said. “Although banks may still tinker with
staffing numbers, most of the obvious and immediate cuts are
likely to have now been made.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
