China’s  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  entered a bull
market after rallying 20 percent from its 2012 low amid signs of
an economic recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.  The gauge tracking 300 yuan-denominated A shares traded in
 Shanghai  and Shenzhen gained 0.5 percent to 2,535.99 at the
close, led by health-care and financial companies. The CSI 300
rebounded 20 percent since hitting a near four-year low on Dec.
3, while the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 17 percent. The
Shanghai index added 0.4 percent to 2,285.36 at today’s close.  “The rally momentum hasn’t ended,” said  Zhang Gang , a
strategist at Central China Securities Holdings Co. in Shanghai.
“Expectations for policy measures aren’t completely priced in.
Investors are still waiting for the new government to act with
policy initiatives. Economic data are showing steady gains.”  Chinese stocks have rallied in the past month on
speculation increased spending on infrastructure will spur a
rebound in the economy from a seven-quarter slowdown. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in Hong
Kong rose 0.3 percent and is up 33 percent since reaching last
year’s low on Sept. 5. A gain of 20 percent or more signals a
bull market to some investors.  The nation’s gross domestic product probably expanded 7.8
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, from a three-
year low of 7.4 percent in the previous three months, according
to the median estimate of 34 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
last month. The GDP data are scheduled to be released Jan. 18.  Urban Development  Li Keqiang, No 2 in the ruling Communist Party’s hierarchy,
is championing urbanization as a new growth engine that will
boost incomes and consumption. The focus on improving public
transport comes as the government faces growing discontent over
pollution that’s caused partly by surging car ownership.  Policy makers will support the development of
environmentally friendly urban transport systems and offer tax
breaks and fuel subsidies for mass transit vehicles, according
to a statement by the State Council on Jan. 5.  The Shanghai Composite climbed 3.2 percent last year, as
the government cut trading fees and dividend taxes for long-term
investors while more than doubling the amount of shares overseas
money managers can own to restore confidence as trading volumes
sank to a four-year low last month.  The Chinese government is “doing all they can” to revive
A-shares, Mark Mobius of Templeton  Emerging Markets  Group, said
in an interview in Kuala Lumpur. That is giving “greater
confidence” to retail investors, he said.  Trading Jumps  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 27 percent
higher than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The index trades at 9.9 times estimated earnings,
compared with the five-year average of 15.3, according to weekly
Bloomberg data.  Beijing Tiantan Biological Products jumped 10 percent today
on speculation medicine demand will increase after two women
died from the H1N1 flu strain in Beijing and the government set
targets for growth in the biomedical industry. Shanghai Pudong
Development Bank Co. surged to a 7-month high after estimating
higher net income.  The CSI 300’s last bull-market rally began in July 2010 and
lasted until November that year with the stock gauge jumping 41
percent. The index entered a bear market in August 2011 as the
government raised interest rates and ordered banks to set aside
more funds as deposit reserves to cool inflation.  The Shanghai index posted its largest monthly gain since
July 2009 last month after the government said it would spend
more on urban development to drive economic growth.  Banks Rally  Shanghai Pudong Development Bank climbed 3 percent to 10.32
 yuan . Its 2012 net income may be 34.2 billion yuan ($5.49
billion), according to statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
Industrial Bank Co. jumped 3.4 percent to 17.36 yuan. China
Minsheng Banking Corp. surged 4.3 percent to 8.32 yuan.  Pudong Bank’s better-than-expected 25 percent profit growth
“raises the curtain” for Chinese banks’ earnings reports, Ping
An Securities said in a note today. “We expect more banks to
post results that beat market expectations and dismiss concerns
on profit growth and asset quality. Banking valuations will be
repaired as fundamentals improve,” Ping An said.  A gauge of health-care stocks in the CSI 300 rose 2
percent, the most among 10 industry groups. Beijing Tiantan
Biological Products surged 1.22 yuan to 13.41 yuan. Hualan
Biological Engineering Inc. jumped 10 percent to 22.61 yuan.  The two women, aged 22 and 65, died amid the highest number
of flu cases in  China ’s capital since 2008, Beijing News
reported. Separately, the State Council said China is targeting
annual output growth of more than 20 percent from 2013 to 2015
in the biomedical industry, according to a statement posted on
the central government’s website yesterday.  SOE Reform  China’s new leaders need to push ahead with reform of
state-owned companies to extend the biggest monthly gain for
Chinese stocks in two years, according to the Shanghai
government’s investment arm.  The new generation of Communist Party leaders headed by Xi
Jinping needs to break the monopoly of government enterprises by
introducing more competition and to ease financing for smaller
companies to keep economic growth at about 7 percent to 8
percent over the next 10 years, Pang Yang, chief executive
officer with the financial-service advisory unit of Shanghai
Alliance Investment Ltd., said in an interview at a Bloomberg
hedge-fund forum in Shanghai on Jan. 5.  GoerTek Inc. (002241) , a supplier to Apple Inc., dropped 3.8 percent
to 35.27 yuan. A gauge of technology shares in the CSI 300
slipped 0.4 percent today. Still, the technology measure trades
at 22 times reported earnings, compared with 12.8 for the
broader index.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index, the measure of the most-
traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, gained 0.4 percent in New
York on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
