Vietnam’s  stocks  rose the most among
 Asia ’s largest equity markets on speculation the government will
take steps to help companies cope with a slowing economy.  The VN Index rose 1.7 percent to 433.19 at the midday break
in  Ho Chi Minh City , the highest level since Aug. 20. The gauge
has gained for a ninth day, poised for the longest winning
streak since Jan. 19, 2012.  Vingroup JSC (VIC) , the country’s largest
listed property developer, surged 4.4 percent to 83,500 dong.
 Bao Viet Holdings (BVH) , the biggest Vietnamese insurer, jumped 5
percent to 46,600 dong.  The State Securities Commission has proposed measures such
as removing the cap on overseas investment in some industries
and allowing foreigners to buy non-voting shares, Thoi Bao Kinh
Te Vietnam reported on Jan. 4, without saying where it got the
information. The government will seek to address economic
challenges in 2013, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said Jan. 1.  “The market is being cheered up by potential government
measures,” Hoang Thach Lan, head of the brokerage unit at Ho
Chi Minh City-based MHB Securities Co., the equity investment
arm of Mekong Housing Bank, said by phone. “Investors are
buying.”  Vietnam  is struggling to boost an  economy  that expanded at
the slowest pace in 13 years in 2012 as a slump in bank lending
crimped domestic demand, adding pressure on the government to
revamp the financial system. Dung has identified bad debts at
banks as an obstacle to economic growth.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
