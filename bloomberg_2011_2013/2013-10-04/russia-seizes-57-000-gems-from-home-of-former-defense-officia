Russian investigators seized 57,000
diamonds, rubies and emeralds from the home of a former Defense
Ministry property chief who’s been charged with 12 counts of
fraud, the Investigative Committee said on its  website .  Evgeniya Vasilyeva, 34, and two other former Defense
Ministry officials were arrested late last year and charged in a
case involving the sale of 4 billion rubles ($124 million) of
property by OAO Oboronservis, a supplier of goods and services
to the army.  The jewelry weighed a total of 19 kilograms (42 pounds),
“not counting a collection of expensive watches,” the
committee said in the statement. Vasilyeva, who is under house
arrest, faces a maximum sentence of 12 years in prison.  Vasilyeva’s lawyer, Alexander Gofshtein, declined to
comment and nobody answered the phone at Oboronservis’s listed
number in Moscow during normal business hours today.  President  Vladimir Putin  fired then-Defense Minister
Anatoly Serdyukov in November after the Oboronservis
investigation became public. Serdyukov, now a witness in the
case, is the most senior official ever fired by Putin over
government corruption.  Russia  is the world’s most corrupt major
economy, according to  Transparency International .  To contact the reporter on this story:
