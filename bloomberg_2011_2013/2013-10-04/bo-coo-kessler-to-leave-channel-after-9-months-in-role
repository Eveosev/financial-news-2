HBO  Chief Operating Officer Eric
Kessler, a 27-year veteran of the Time Warner Inc. cable
network, is leaving after less than a year in the role.  “We have decided that the COO position does not best serve
the most effective management process at HBO,” Richard Plepler,
the network’s chief executive officer, said today in a memo to
staff.  Kessler, a 27-year HBO veteran, had been co-president with
Plepler until December. The premium channel is home to shows
including “Game of Thrones” and “Boardwalk Empire.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
