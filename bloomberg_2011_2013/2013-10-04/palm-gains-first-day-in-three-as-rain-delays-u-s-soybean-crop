Palm oil  advanced for the first time
in three days on speculation that rain in the U.S. may delay
harvesting of soybeans crushed to make a substitute.  The contract for December delivery climbed as much as 0.7
percent to 2,319 ringgit ($727) a metric ton on the Bursa
 Malaysia  Derivatives, and was at 2,309 ringgit at the midday
break in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures dropped 1.2 percent in the two
days through yesterday on concern increasing output in Malaysia
would boost inventories. Palm for physical delivery in October
was at 2,320 ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  As much as 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain in the past 24
hours halted fieldwork in Nebraska and  Minnesota  and as much as
2.5 inches in the next four days will stall collection of the
soybean crop in half of the Midwest, a  T-Storm Weather LLC 
report showed yesterday. As of Sept. 29, the harvest trailed the
average in the previous five years, U.S. government data showed.  “Prices are mildly higher because of the news of a late
harvest in the U.S.,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance
Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. The advance “appears to
be capped because of the Malaysia Palm Oil Board data coming out
next week that could show an increase in stockpiles.” Malaysia
is the world’s biggest producer after  Indonesia .  Soybean oil  for delivery in December fell 0.4 percent to
40.13 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade after climbing
2.3 percent yesterday. Soybeans for November delivery fell 0.4
percent to $12.875 a bushel after a 1.1 percent jump yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
