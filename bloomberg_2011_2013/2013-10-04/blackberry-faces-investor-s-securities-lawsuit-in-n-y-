BlackBerry (BB)  Ltd. and two executives
were sued by an investor who alleges they artificially inflated
the company’s stock through false and misleading statements
about the smartphone maker’s success and prospects.  Marvin Pearlstein, an investor, alleges in a proposed class
action, or group suit, filed yesterday in federal court in
 Manhattan  that BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins
and Chief Financial Officer Brian Bidulka engaged in a scheme to
deceive investors about the company’s health and prospects for
the BlackBerry 10 product line of smartphones.  According to the suit, BlackBerry made false and misleading
statements in a Sept. 27, 2012, press release when it claimed
the new phone would “drive improvements across the company.”
On a conference call that day with investors, Heins allegedly
made statements that BlackBerry “continues to be a financially
strong company and we’re executing and delivering on our
commitments,” and that it “remains a strong, innovative and
relevant player in the mobile computing world.”  “The company was not on the road to recovery and re-emerging as a lead player in the wireless communications
industry,” the plaintiff said in the complaint. “In reality,
the BlackBerry 10 was not well received by the market and the
company was forced to write down a nearly $1 billion charge
related to unsold BlackBerry 10 devices and lay off
approximately 4,500 employees, totaling approximately 40 percent
of its total workforce,” according to the complaint.  Adam Emery, a spokesman for Waterloo, Ontario-based
BlackBerry, declined to comment on the lawsuit.  Shares Inflated  The price of the company’s stock was inflated through a
series of misleading statements and information, Pearlstein
alleges. Once the truth was disclosed, the company’s share price
fell, he said. BlackBerry fell 16 percent in trading in Toronto
on Sept. 20.  The suit, seeks to include as plaintiffs shareholders who
suffered unspecified damages after buying BlackBerry common
stock from Sept. 27, 2012, until Sept. 20. It also alleges
claims for misrepresentations to investors and the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission about the true nature of the
company’s operation, management and future business prospects as
well as the true value of the company’s common stock and alleges
that Heins and Bidulka are liable for their wrongful conduct.  BlackBerry, coping with plunging sales and mounting red
ink, is streamlining the business as it looks to seal a $4.7
billion buyout deal with its largest shareholder,  Fairfax
Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH)   The company agreed to the tentative offer last month after
years of losing ground to Apple Inc. and  Samsung Electronics (005930)  Co.
In addition to the job cuts, BlackBerry is writing down unsold
phone inventory by almost $1 billion.  The case is Pearlstein v.  BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY) , 13-cv-07060,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
