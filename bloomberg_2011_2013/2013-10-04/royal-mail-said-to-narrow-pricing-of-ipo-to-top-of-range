The U.K. government is offering
shares of  Royal Mail  Group Ltd. at a price of 300 pence to 330
pence ($4.84-$5.33) apiece amid strong demand for the initial
public offering, two people familiar with the matter said.  The  price range  has been narrowed from an initial span of
260 pence to 330 pence, according to the people, who asked not
to be named while the offering is under way. The sale closes to
investors on Oct. 8 before trading commences on Oct. 11.  The IPO was opened on Sept. 27 and fully subscribed within
hours, mainly on institutional demand, people with knowledge of
the situation have said previously. The privatization of 360-year-old Royal Mail will be the biggest in the U.K. since former
Prime Minister  John Major  broke up British Rail in the 1990s,
and while letter volumes are falling, the business has refocused
on those markets spurred by a trend toward web-based purchasing.  “What investors likely find interesting with Royal Mail is
the remaining restructuring potential,” said Marcus Poppe, a
 fund manager  at DWS in  Frankfurt , adding that this sets it apart
from companies revamped by private equity firms and then taken
public. DWS, which manages 160 billion euros ($218 billion) in
 Germany , is Deutsche Bank’s retail asset management arm.  Market Value  The volume of IPOs in Europe has tripled in the year-to-date versus 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as investors
are drawn by strengthening economies.  Royal Mail will have a market capitalization of between 2.6
billion pounds and 3.3 billion pounds once listed, based on the
initial range, with 401 million to 522 million shares due to be
sold, equating to as much as 52.2 percent of its capital.  The postal service has a 53 percent share of U.K. parcel
deliveries and reported revenue of about 9.1 billion pounds in
fiscal 2013. Its operating profit, after some costs, was 440
million pounds.  One of the country’s largest employers with more than
150,000 staff, Royal Mail has shifted away from letters to more
lucrative package shipping, competing with  TNT Express NV (TNTE)  of the
Netherlands and  Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ’s DHL Express.  The government, which decided in 2011 to privatize Royal
Mail, will retain between 37.8 and 49.9 percent of stock,
assuming no over-allotment options. A further 15 percent of
shares may be made available beyond the base offer.  About 70 percent of the base offer is expected to go to
institutional investors and the rest to retail buyers and Royal
Mail workers.  Bookrunners for the sale are Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS
AG, Barclays Plc and Merrill Lynch & Co., with Investec Ltd.,
Nomura Bank International Plc and RBC Europe Ltd. lead managers,
while the government is being advised by  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)   To contact the reporters on this story:
