Rigs targeting oil and natural gas in
the U.S. increased by 12 this week to 1,756, according to  Baker
Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  rose by 10 to 1,372, data posted on the company’s
website show. The  gas  count gained two to 378, the Houston-based
field services company said.  The  U.S. rig count  has declined by seven this year as the
boom in shale oil and gas plays slow and technological
improvements shorten drilling times, weakening demand for
additional equipment. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal
drilling helped the U.S. meet 87 percent of its own energy needs
in the first six months of 2013, on pace to be the highest
annual rate since 1986, according to the Energy Information
Administration.  “U.S. rig activity continues to lag expectations with rig
efficiency and service intensity yielding modest oil service
demand growth in a flattish rig count environment,” Stephen Gengaro, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in  New York ,
said in a research note Sept. 30. “Looking ahead, we expect
only modest rig count growth near term with likely improvement
gaining traction in 2014.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery rose 25
cents to $103.56 a barrel at 1:19 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up 13 percent in the past year.  U.S. oil output gained 7,000 barrels a day to 7.78 million
in the week ended Sept. 27, near a 24-year high, according to
the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm. Stockpiles
rose by 5.47 million barrels, or 1.5 percent, to 363.7 million,
the most since July.  Natural gas for November delivery increased 0.2 cent to
$3.501 per million British thermal units on the Nymex, up 2.8
percent from a year ago.  Gas Supplies  U.S. gas stockpiles  rose 101 billion cubic feet last week
to 3.487 trillion, the EIA said yesterday. Supplies were 4.3
percent below year-earlier inventories, the agency said.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  said in a statement yesterday that
roads and bridges damaged in Colorado during flooding last month
had affected the company’s ability to move rigs and compression
units. The flood halted an estimated 12 percent of the state’s
daily oil production.  Tropical Storm Karen has also curbed energy production in
the  Gulf of Mexico  and triggered a  hurricane watch  along the
U.S. Gulf Coast. The system was expected to make landfall as a
tropical storm Oct. 6 on the southeastern tip of Louisiana, and
then again near Mobile,  Alabama , according to the National
Hurricane Center in Miami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
