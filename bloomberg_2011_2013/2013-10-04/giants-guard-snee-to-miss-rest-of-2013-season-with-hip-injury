New York  Giants guard Chris Snee
will miss the rest of the 2013 National Football League season
with a hip injury.  The four-time Pro Bowl selection was placed on injured
reserve, the Giants announced today in an e-mailed release. Snee
has not played since leaving midway through the team’s loss to
the Carolina Panthers on Sept. 22.  Snee, 31, told reporters today that he probably would have
surgery in the near future. He was not specific about how the
injury happened or his diagnosis.  “I’ve done everything I can to get this hip right, and
it’s just not where it needs to be for me to play at the level I
want to play at,” he said. “I’m not going to get into what
happened or why it happened, I’ve played a lot of games for this
team and had a lot of wear on this body. If I was able to play
through something, I would.”  Snee was selected by the Giants in the second round of the
2004 NFL Draft. He’s started 152 of 159 games over the past 10
seasons, according to the release.  Giants center David Baas, who has a neck injury, will also
miss the team’s Oct. 6 game against the Philadelphia Eagles. The
Giants offensive line has surrendered 18 sacks this year,
second-most in the NFL behind the St. Louis Rams.  -- Editor: Michael Sillup  To contact the reporters on this story:
