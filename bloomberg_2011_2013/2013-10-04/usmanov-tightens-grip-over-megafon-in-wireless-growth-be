Billionaire Alisher Usmanov tightened
his grip over  OAO MegaFon (MFON)  by boosting his stake in a holding
company that controls the second-biggest Russian wireless
carrier, betting on continued growth in mobile-data demand.  Garsdale, an investment vehicle that controls MegaFon,
bought 13.5 percent of its own shares from the founders of
Scartel, a data carrier recently purchased by MegaFon, Usmanov’s
investment firm USM Holdings said in an e-mailed statement. The
transaction boosts USM’s stake in Garsdale to about 95 percent
from 82 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Garsdale owns just over 50 percent of Moscow-based MegaFon.  Usmanov competes with fellow billionaires  Mikhail Fridman ,
who controls  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , and Vladimir Evtushenkov, who
controls  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , as consumers in Russia
increasingly browse the Web on their mobile phones. MegaFon
completed its purchase of Scartel this month, gaining a faster,
so-called fourth-generation network.  “Acquisition of Scartel created strategic advantages for
MegaFon on the Russian wireless market, boosting its investment
attractiveness,” Ivan Streshinskiy, head of USM, said in the
statement. Buying out Scartel founders “will further enhance
our position on the market.”  The value of the stake purchase announced today is about
$1.5 billion, newspaper  Kommersant  reported. Elena Martynova, a
spokeswoman for USM and Garsdale, declined to comment on terms.  MegaFon  rose  0.5 percent to $36.87 at 9:06 a.m. in London,
valuing the company at about $23 billion. The stock has gained
more than 80 percent since a November initial public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
