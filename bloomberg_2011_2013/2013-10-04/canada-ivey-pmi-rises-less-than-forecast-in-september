Canada’s purchasing managers
increased spending in September by less than economists
forecast, according to a  gauge  released today by Western
University’s business school.  The Ivey Purchasing Managers Index rose to 51.9 in
September on a seasonally adjusted basis, following an August
reading of 51.0, according to a statement on the  London , Ontario
university’s website. Readings of more than 50 indicate
purchasing by governments and companies increased.  Economists projected a reading of 53.6, according to the
median of a Bloomberg survey with 10 responses.  Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem said
this week the nation’s economy will expand more slowly this year
than the central bank forecast as stronger exports and business
investment remain elusive.  The Ivey Employment Index rose to 53.5 in September from
43.6 the month before, while a gauge of inventories rose to 54.2
from 48.7 in August, according to the release.  A gauge of prices increased to 64.0 last month from 60.9,
while the supplier deliveries  index (IVEYSA)  dropped to 45.3 from 45.6
the month before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
