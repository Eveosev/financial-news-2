Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
state-run oil producer, had its rating cut one notch by Moody’s
Investors Service amid a rising debt burden.  Moody’s downgraded Petrobras yesterday to Baa1, the third-lowest investment grade rating, citing total debt that rose by
$16.3 billion in the first half of the year to 3.8 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
or Ebitda. Cash flow for Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras will
remain  negative  into 2015, according to the e-mailed report
yesterday, which maintained a negative outlook.  “The downgrade reflects Petrobras’s high financial
leverage and the expectation that the company will continue to
have large negative cash flow over the next few years as it
pursues its capital spending program,” Moody’s analysts led by
Thomas S. Coleman wrote in the report.  Petrobras, the most-leveraged major oil producer, has been
amassing debt to increase output and refining, a plan Moody’s
says poses “significant execution risk.” The oil producer has
now posted eleven straight quarters of negative free cash flow,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Free cash flow measures
cash from operations after subtracting investment, Bloomberg
data show.  Yields on Petrobras’s dollar bonds due in 2021 have climbed
1.68 percentage point this year to 5.30 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
