Italy’s Lazio will play its next
Europa League soccer home game in an empty stadium because of
racist chanting by its supporters during a 1-0 win over Legia
Warsaw on Sept. 19.  The club will be forced to play without anyone in the
stands at its home match on Nov. 7 against Cyprus’s Apollon.  The Rome-based team was also fined 40,000 euros ($54,000)
because of the racism, as well as the display of an
inappropriate banner in the crowd and the lighting of fireworks,
according to a statement e-mailed by UEFA, European soccer’s
governing body.  UEFA said in the statement that it has a “zero tolerance”
policy toward racism “on the pitch and in the stands” and gave
Lazio three days to appeal.  Coach Vladimir Petkovic received a warning after the game
started late.  To contact the reporter on this story:
