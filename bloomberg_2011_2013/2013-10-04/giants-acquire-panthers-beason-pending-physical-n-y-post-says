The  New York Giants  acquired three-time Pro Bowl linebacker Jon Beason from the  Carolina Panthers 
for a 2014 late-round draft pick.  Beason, 28, who was limited to four games last season
before undergoing microfracture surgery on his right knee, has
played in two games this season -- including the Panthers’ 38-0
defeat of the visiting Giants on Sept. 22.  Beason was a first-team All-Pro in 2008, the year after he
was selected by the Panthers with the 25th pick of the National
Football League draft. He went to the Pro Bowl from 2008-10.  The Giants, who host the  Philadelphia Eagles  this weekend,
are 0-4 this season, allowing 384.2 yards per game, which ranks
22nd among the NFL’s 32 teams.  “It’s amazing, it doesn’t happen with midseason trades,”
Beason told reporters yesterday after passing his physical. “I
think I can really come out and impact the season.”  To make room on the roster for Beason, the Giants placed
guard Chris Snee on injured reserve with a hip injury. The
Giants said yesterday that Snee, who was injured in that loss at
the Panthers, will miss the rest of the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
