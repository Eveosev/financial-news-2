Promotora de Informaciones SA  is in
talks with its creditor banks to convert part of the biggest
Spanish media company’s debt into payment-in-kind notes,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  Lenders may swap loans into high-risk, high-yield PIK notes
to shore up the Madrid-based company’s finances, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations
are private. The securities typically pay a higher coupon than
cash-only bonds to compensate for their low place in a company’s
capital structure and the possibility issuers can pay interest
with debt.  Prisa owed about 3.4 billion euros ($4.6 billion) at the
end of June, according to a filing. The company is considering
paying down the PIK by selling assets, including its pay-TV
business and a 17.3 percent stake in  Mediaset Espana
Comunicacion SA (TL5) , said one of the people. No final decision has
been made because negotiations are continuing, the person said.  An official for Prisa in  Madrid , who asked not to be
identified citing company policy, declined to comment.  Prisa said in June it had support from lenders holding 72.9
percent of its debt. The owner of El Pais newspaper said at the
time it also got a credit facility from banks for as much as 80
million euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
