Kenya  will receive a 16.7 million-euro loan ($22.7 million) from  Belgium  to increase the supply of
water in Elgeyo Marakwet County in the western Rift Valley.  The money will pay to construct a dam on the Charama river,
build a water-purification plant with a capacity of 4,280 cubic
meters a day and install 23 kilometers (14 miles) of water
pipelines, the Belgian Embassy in Kenya said in a statement
handed to reporters today in the capital, Nairobi. The funds
will also be used to build an underground storage tank capable
of holding 1,250 cubic meters of water, it said.  Residents of Iten, the capital of Elgeyo Marakwet county,
and Tambach town have suffered with “inadequate and unreliable
supplies of water,” Environment Secretary Judy Wakhungu said
today. “The project will meet water needs for the two towns.”  Brussels-based  ASPAC Intl.  and Rift Valley Water Services
Board, a Kenyan company, will carry out the work.  The loan is interest-free and must be repaid over 15 years
and six months, with a grace period of two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
