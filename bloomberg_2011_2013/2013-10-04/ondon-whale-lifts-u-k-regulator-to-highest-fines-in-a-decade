The U.K. finance regulator recorded
its largest month of fines in more than a decade in September,
buoyed by a 137.6 million-pound ($221.2 million) penalty against
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  over the London Whale debacle.  Industry fines totaled 169.5 million pounds last month and
brought total penalties from the Financial Conduct Authority in
2013 to 339.5 million pounds, according to statistics published
today by  Wolters Kluwer NV (WKL) ,  Europe ’s largest tax and legal
publisher. The year-to-date total is larger than any other full
year since 2002.  The regulator fined JPMorgan as part of a probe into losses
exceeding $6.2 billion on a derivatives position built by a
trader who came to be known as the London Whale because his bets
were so large. The past year has also seen the regulator punish
banks embroiled in the scandal over rigging of the London
Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor.  “The FCA is endeavoring to keep up with the international
trend towards greater levels of fining and is continuing the
trajectory started in the U.K. by the Financial Services
Authority in its latter years,” said Barnabas Reynolds, a
London lawyer at U.S. law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP. The FSA
became the FCA in April this year.  FCA fines increased considerably last year hitting 313.4
million pounds at the end of 2012 compared with 66.1 million
pounds in 2011.  “The FCA is clear that where there is poor behavior we
will act quickly with punishments we believe reflect the
seriousness of what has taken place,” the FCA said in an
emailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
