Yulia Tymoshenko, Ukraine’s jailed
ex-prime minister, backed a European Union proposal that she get
medical care in  Germany  as the 28-member bloc seeks concessions
from the government before signing an integration pact.  The idea, put forward by former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and ex-European Parliament head Pat Cox, who also
asked President  Viktor Yanukovych  pardon her, requires approval
from the Ukrainian authorities, according to Tymoshenko’s lawyer
Serhiy Vlasenko. Darka Cherpak, Yanukovych’s spokeswoman, wasn’t
available when contacted today on her mobile phone.  Ukraine is seeking to sign a European Union Association
Agreement and free-trade pact in  Lithuania  in November, fixing a
westward shift and rejecting membership of a Russian-led customs
union. The EU accord has been delayed since 2011 as Tymoshenko,
a Yanukovych rival in the 2004 Orange Revolution, was convicted
in a case she and the EU deem selective justice. Tymoshenko has
suffered from back complaints while in prison.  “I’m ready to accept this proposal for the sake of a
successful Vilnius, a successful Ukraine, for the sake of a
historical and momentous agreement with the EU,” Tymoshenko
said today in a statement on her party’s website. “We won’t
miss this chance.”  Yanukovych said Sept. 20 that he can’t pardon Tymoshenko
while other outstanding court cases against her remain
unresolved. Tymoshenko still faces murder and tax evasion
charges, which she denies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
