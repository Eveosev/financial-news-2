Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  is increasing
sales of structured notes that benefit when long-term interest
rates increase.  France’s third-largest bank by market value sold $235
million of ratchet notes in September, lifting monthly issuance
of the securities to the most since May 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The notes pay returns based on moves in interest rate
swaps, which jumped after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled in May that stimulus measures will be unwound.
Investors receive 6 percent in the first year, then the coupon
adjusts higher or lower the following year, depending on how the
10-year swap rate changes. Swaps measure the cost of exchanging
fixed-rate interest payments for floating.  “This is a product designed to benefit from a steepening
of the curve and is particularly appealing to private banks
wishing to implement this view,” said Eric Etienne, the global
head of non-linear trading at  Credit Agricole  in London.  The Paris-based bank’s $100 million of 10-year securities
sold Sept. 19 were the largest ratchet notes issued this year,
Bloomberg data show. Barclays Plc sold $30 million of 10-year
notes on Oct. 1, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
