FIFA, soccer’s ruling body, will
decide on the dates of the 2022  World Cup  in  Qatar  after next
year’s tournament in Brazil to allow teams, players and other
participants to be consulted, President  Sepp Blatter  said.  FIFA’s executive committee “decided to launch a
consultation process among main stakeholders for Qatar 2022
dates,” Blatter said today on Twitter. “No decision will be
taken before 2014 World Cup.”  FIFA’s top officials today discussed whether to move the
Qatar event to the winter to avoid the summer heat in the
emirate three years after awarding the event to the country.
They also discussed an increase in deaths of Nepalese
immigrants in Qatar, some of whom are working on tournament
projects.  “FIFA cannot interfere with the labor rights of any
country, but we cannot ignore them,” Blatter said in another
statement on Twitter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
