Chinese stocks had the biggest weekly
gain in a month in  New York , as Twitter Inc.’s planned initial
public offering boosted social-media companies from  Sina Corp. (SINA) 
to  Renren Inc. (RENN)   The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. added 1.1 percent to 104.76
yesterday, taking its advance this week to 2.6 percent. Sina,
China’s biggest Twitter-like microblogging service, rallied to
the highest level since October 2011. Renren posted the biggest
weekly advance in more than a year, and  YY Inc. (YY) , owner of a
social entertainment website rose 3.1 percent for the week.  Twitter, which has more than 200 million monthly users,
made public its S-1 prospectus on Oct. 3 saying it’s seeking to
raise $1 billion in an IPO. The documents suggested a valuation
of $12.8 billion. Internet companies fueled an 18 percent rally
in the China-US gauge last quarter, with stock from NQ Mobile
Inc. and E-House China Holdings Ltd. rallying more than 100
percent. Tencent Holdings Ltd., Asia’s largest Internet company,
is the second-best  performer  this year in  Hong Kong .  “Twitter’s IPO is a vote of confidence for the social-media industry,” Jay Jacobs, a research analyst at Global X
Funds, a New York-based exchange-traded fund that manages $2.3
billion in assets, said by phone. “There’s a big appetite right
now for a lot of these social media related names, including
China’s Sina, Tencent.”  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 1.3 percent to $38.01
in New York. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.7 percent
as optimism grew that lawmakers would reach a deal to end the
budget impasse and avoid a default on the federal debt.  Sina, based in Shanghai, climbed 4.7 percent yesterday to
$90.48 in New York, the highest since October 2011. It has
rallied 10 percent this week, the most in two months.  American depositary receipts of Renren, based in Beijing,
surged 5.5 percent to a seven-week high of $4.04. Its 20 percent
advance in the week is the biggest since April 2012.  Guangzhou-based YY advanced 2.7 percent to $49.72
yesterday. It climbed to $50.47 on Oct. 2, the highest close
since its IPO in November.  The Global X Social Media  Index (HSCEI)   ETF (SOCL) , which tracks 27 social
media companies including Facebook Inc. and Tencent, advanced
1.8 percent this week.  Elong Inc. (LONG) , China’s second-largest travel-booking website
whose biggest shareholder is Expedia Inc., jumped 30 percent
this week to $22.80.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index advanced 0.2 percent
this week to 10,517.28. Markets in mainland China will remain
