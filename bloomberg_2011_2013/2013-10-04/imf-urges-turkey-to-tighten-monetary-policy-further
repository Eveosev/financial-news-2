The International Monetary Fund said
Turkey’s  monetary policy  needs to be tightened further amid
inflation that’s “well above” the country’s 5 percent target
and high credit growth.  The Washington-based IMF, commenting in an e-mailed
statement after its annual assessment of Turkey’s economy, also
recommended the government rein in spending. The fund forecast
growth of 3.8 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
