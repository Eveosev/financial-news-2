The cost of insuring company and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index jumped 2 basis points to
122 as of 10:34 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices. The measure is poised for its third weekly rise,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  added 2 basis points to 153 basis points
as of 8:23 a.m. in Hong Kong,  Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ)  prices show. The benchmark is set for its second
straight week of increases, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index added 1.5 basis points to
93.75 basis points as of 9:42 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The gauge is set for its biggest daily
gain since Sept. 30, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
