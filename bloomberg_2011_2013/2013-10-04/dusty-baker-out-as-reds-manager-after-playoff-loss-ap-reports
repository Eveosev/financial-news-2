Dusty Baker  will not return as
manager of the Cincinnati Reds following the team’s playoff loss
to the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Associated Press reported.  The Reds will announce later today Baker will be replaced,
AP said, citing an unidentified person familiar with the Major
League Baseball team’s situation. It’s not known if Baker has
been fired or resigned, AP said.  Baker, 64, spent six seasons in Cincinnati, reaching the
playoffs three times without advancing. The Reds finished third
in the National League Central Division this season with a 90-72
record to earn the second of two wild-card spots in the
playoffs, where they lost in Pittsburgh 6-2 three days ago.  Baker had one season left on a two-year contract he signed
after last season, AP said. He’s also managed the San Francisco
Giants and  Chicago Cubs  and was named the NL Manager of the Year
three times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
