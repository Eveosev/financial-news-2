A lecture about the human genome lured a few hundred finance professionals to spend a night away from their toddlers on the campus of Rockefeller University.  The Parents & Science benefit began with Jeffrey Friedman speaking on “Your Child’s Medical Future in the 10X Genetic Revolution.”  “It was awesome,” said Kevin T. Hammond, a vice president at JLL Partners Inc., who has a 10-month-old.  Hammond had found out about the event from his boss’s wife. There were definitely some older parental influencers in the tent, including E. John Rosenwald, Russ Carson and David H. Koch.  David Wassong of Soros Fund Management LLC, who has 14-month-old twins, shared a table with fashion designer Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss.  Doug Silverman of Senator Investment Group LP sat with Beth Kojima of TPG-Axon Capital Management LP. Carter Neild of OrbiMed Advisors LLC was seated with Alexander von Perfall, of RP Management LLC.  The event raised more than $1.1 million.  Xu Zhen  Chinese artist Xu Zhen is afraid of flying, so he didn’t make the party in his honor at the Top of the Standard.  The occasion: He’s been chosen to design T-shirts, tote bags -- and art -- for the March 2014 edition of the Armory Show, which will have a section devoted to Chinese contemporary art.  Expect pranks. Mountaineers sawed 6 feet from the top of  Mount Everest  in a video Xu staged. At Art Basel  Miami Beach , his replica of a Chinese convenience store supplied wealthy patrons with empty packages of noodles and toothpaste.  “Chinese art, let’s face it, gets a bad rap,” said Philip Tinari, director of the  Ullens Center for Contemporary Art  in Beijing, on Wednesday night. “Pink babies and green dogs ... That’s over. There’s a flourishing art scene.”  The Armory Show’s Chinese section will focus on artists born after Mao’s death in 1976. For that generation, Tinari said, Xu is the ringleader.  Broadway Born  Broadway stars performed at 54 Below on Monday to help raise money for people with paralysis. The “Born for Broadway” fundraiser was started by Sarah Galli when she was a student at Marymount Manhattan College.  Annaleigh Ashford, who plays a prostitute and lesbian on the new series “Masters of Sex,” performed a duet with a classmate from Marymount, Kathleen Monteleone. Carole Lasser, sister of stage director Marcia Milgrom Dodge, performed a Gershwin piece set for right hand only as her left hand became paralyzed after a brain tumor.
