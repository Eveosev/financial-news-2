Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, said investors bought 94.6 percent of
the shares in its rights offering, leaving the banks managing
the sale to sell about 472 million pounds ($761 million) of
stock.  The lender raised about 5.6 billion pounds with 3.05
billion shares sold at 185 pence apiece. The banks managing the
offering plan to sell the remaining 172.9 million shares, the
London-based bank said in a statement today.  “That’s a pretty good take up, and I think it leaves
Barclays shares well placed to enjoy a good run,” said  Simon Willis , a banking analyst at  Daniel Stewart Securities Plc (DAN)  in
 London .  Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins  in July said the
London-based bank planned to raise 5.8 billion pounds in the
stock sale to meet stricter capital rules. The U.K.’s Prudential
Regulation Authority is imposing a 3 percent leverage ratio,
forcing banks to hold 3 pounds of equity for every 100 pounds of
assets to make the financial system safer.  Barclays fell 2.1 pence, or 0.8 percent, to 270.9 pence in
London at 8:22 a.m. local time, valuing the lender at 43.6
billion pounds. The shares are up about 12 percent this year.  Barclays was one of only two British lenders to miss the
regulator’s leverage target in June, with 2.5 percent.
 Nationwide Building Society , which at 2 percent also failed, was
given until the end of 2015 to make up the shortfall.  Shrinking Assets  Investors were invited to buy one new share for every four
they already owned at 40 percent less than the closing price the
day before the offer. Barclays is also shrinking assets by as
much as 80 billion pounds to 1.5 trillion pounds and selling 2
billion pounds of loss-absorbing securities.  The offering is the biggest for a U.K. lender since Lloyds
Banking Group Plc raised 13.5 billion pounds in 2009. Today’s
transaction was underwritten by banks led by Credit Suisse Group
AG, Deutsche Bank AG,  Bank of America Corp. , and  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
Those lenders were also book runners with Barclays, which acted
as co-ordinator.  Jenkins, 52, expects to spend about 1.4 billion pounds by
2015 in an overhaul of the consumer bank, about half the total
cost of his revamp, the lender said last month.  The bank will spend about 600 million pounds on
“rightsizing, industrialization and innovation” in its
investment bank, about 400 million pounds in its wealth unit and
more than 300 million pounds at the corporate bank, Barclays
said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
