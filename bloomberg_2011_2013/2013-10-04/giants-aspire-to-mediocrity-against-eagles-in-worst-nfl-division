Mediocrity looks to be enough to win
the National Football Conference East, where the  New York Giants ,
 Philadelphia Eagles ,  Dallas Cowboys  and  Washington Redskins  have
a combined 4-12 record this season.  Since the  National Football League  split into eight four-team divisions in 2002, only three division champions have
failed to produce a winning record, most recently in 2011 when
the Tim Tebow-led Denver Broncos captured the American Football
Conference West at 8-8.  The NFC East could make it four, as the division that has
produced 12 Super Bowl championship teams has two fewer wins
than any other this year. As the 0-4 Giants prepare to host the
1-3 Eagles in two days at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford,
New Jersey, both teams remain in contention for a playoff spot
in a division led by the 2-2 Cowboys, who face the undefeated
 Denver Broncos  this weekend.  “It’s more likely than not that 8-8 actually wins the
division,” said ESPN analyst Tim Hasselbeck, who was in the NFL
from 2002 to 2007 and played quarterback for the Giants,
Redskins and Eagles. “Maybe there’s a tiebreaker decision with
another 8-8 team, but I think 8-8 gets it done.”  NFC East teams are 2-10 against non-division opponents, one
reason oddsmakers made the Cowboys 8 1/2-point underdogs at home
against the Peyton Manning-led Broncos, who have won their first
four games by an average of 22 points.  The Giants, one of the NFL’s four winless teams, are
favored by 2 1/2 points over the Eagles. The game is a matchup
of the two defenses that have allowed the most points in the
league -- the Giants surrendering 146, the Eagles 138.  Division Realists  “We’re realists in our division,”  Victor Cruz , who leads
the Giants with 425 receiving yards, told reporters this week.
“We understand what’s in front of us and we understand that
there’s still a shot. We’re not completely out of this thing.”  The 2010  Seattle Seahawks  were the only team since the
NFL’s 2002 realignment to make the playoffs with a losing record,
grabbing the NFC West title at 7-9. The 2008  San Diego Chargers 
captured the AFC West crown with an 8-8 mark.  Giants coach  Tom Coughlin  said this week his sole focus is
on getting the team’s first victory of the season. Quarterback
Eli Manning described it differently, saying the coaching staff
has made sure the players realize the division title remains
within their reach.  “Coach brought that up the other day, so we understand,”
said Manning, who has thrown an NFL-high nine interceptions
while being sacked 14 times. “There’s a lot of football left.
We’re a better team than what we’ve been playing like, but we’ve
got to go out there and prove it.”  Target: 1-4  Only one other division is led by a team without a 3-1 or
4-0 record. In the AFC North, the  Cleveland Browns  are 3-2 after
a 37-24 win over the Buffalo Bills last night.  Even at 1-4, the Giants would be only one game out of the
division lead if they win and the Cowboys lose to the Broncos,
who have 15 consecutive regular-season victories.  While the 1992 Chargers are the only team to reach the
playoffs following an 0-4 start, the Giants’ postseason odds
would markedly improve with a win.  Since the NFL went to its current 12-team playoff format in
1990, six teams have recovered to make the postseason after
starting 1-4, most recently the 2011 Broncos. The 1992 Chargers,
1993 Houston Oilers, 2002 Tennessee Titans, 2002  New York  Jets
and 2004  Green Bay Packers  also advanced after opening 1-4.  “Once we get that first one under our belt, I think it
will start going in the right direction,” Cruz said. “The key
is getting that first one.”  One Loss  While the Giants and Eagles have one win between them,
three Week 5 games feature opponents that have combined for one
loss. The 4-0  New Orleans Saints  visit the 3-1 Chicago Bears,
the 4-0 Kansas City Chiefs are at the 3-1 Titans, and the 3-1
Indianapolis Colts host the 4-0 Seahawks.  “It’s an exciting matchup,” Seahawks coach  Pete Carroll 
said at a news conference this week. “It’s a cool team to go
against and a difficult game. We’ll get it all cranked up, take
it on the road and see if we can’t get a good win.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
