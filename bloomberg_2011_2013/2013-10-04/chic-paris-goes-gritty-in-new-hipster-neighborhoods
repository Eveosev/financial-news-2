Wow, Parisians are loud. It was 10:15 on a Thursday night at Bones, a restaurant in the eleventh arrondissement, and the din was making it difficult to focus on the menu. A group of scarlet-lipped girls, one wearing a large black hat, another a floral headband, were screeching, roaring, and convulsing in the bar in front of the dining room. I've seen plenty of Paris since I first ventured across the Channel as a bespectacled thirteen-year-old on a school exchange program from London, but I've never seen anything this, well, lively. Even just a decade or so ago, on my romantic Eurostar weekends that are a rite of passage of the twentysomething London couple, the only place in Paris I could find open after midnight was the Buddha-Bar, a vermillion-and-gold TARDIS that felt about as French as a bhang lassi and about as hip as my mother's book group. Now here I was, in a city that has always taken its food too seriously to allow the decibel level of its restaurants to creep above a conversational hum, surrounded by the exuberant clamor of people having fun. France's economy may be flailing and its politics in stasis, but its youth culture is finally catching up with the rest of the world's. The place to see—and hear—it is a cluster of heretofore sleepy arrondissements in the northeast of Paris, where social and economic forces have combined to create a vibrant hipster crucible with its own internationally inflected yet unmistakably French take on cuisine, the bars, fashion, and art. "The center of Paris is a museum. It's for tourists," graffiti artist turned hotel and club king André Saraiva told me when I met him at his Hôtel Amour, which occupies a former brothel on the edge of the ninth. "Most Parisians don't feel comfortable there, and licensing laws mean only multinationals can afford to open bars and clubs." As property prices have risen, a class of young creative types have gradually fanned north of the store- and gallery-choked Marais and the ninth arrondissement into the tenth, eleventh, nineteenth, and twentieth arrondissements, traditionally the preserves of working-class families. This wave of graphic and Web designers, artists, writers, and fashion folk are transforming the northeast corner of Paris into a redoubt that's both gritty and chic, creating an unmistakable style and sense of  endroit . I couldn't miss it at Le Dauphin, a Rem Koolhaas-designed wine bar in the eleventh arrondissement that is heavy on marble and serves mind-blowing small plates like squid ink risotto and smoked veal  haché . But it was the crowd that did it for me. They wore the international uniform of the hipster—plaid shirts, ad specs, bright-red lips for her, beard for him—but they pulled it off in a way that was unequivocally, unmistakably French. It was one part what God gave them—that lean-limbed, dark-eyed, long-nosed combo you just don't get anywhere else—and two parts studied understatement. All hipsters want to look effortlessly, sloppily, anti-label cool; Parisian  'ipsters , which is what they call them here, take haute street style to another level. They may have spent two thousand euros on their outfit and two hours in front of the mirror perfecting the look, but you'd think it was thrown together between drags on a Gitane. More From  Condé Nast Traveler :  Of all the Paris fashion houses channeling the je m'en fous vibe of the 'ipsters (even Saint-Laurent, under new artistic director Hedi Slimane, got all grunge this season with a plaid and black leather collection that was a 180 from years past), it's Isabel Marant who does it best. Walk along the Canal St-Martin on a sunny Saturday afternoon; unwrap your escargot-shaped pastry from Du Pain et Des Idées atop the Amélie bridge; stride up to the nosebleed Parc de Belleville in the twentieth (which has, by the way, one of the best panoramas of the city, with the Eiffel Tower, the Centre Pompidou, Notre-Dame, and the Panthéon all lining up in the distance), and you will see her look if not her clothes. Marant opened her first store in the eleventh arondissement in 1998, but it's only in the last few seasons that she's become a global phenomenon, due partly to her wedge sneakers, which have been endlessly imitated, and some bashed-up leather ankle boots so popular in northeast Paris that I saw fewer women not wearing them than wearing them. Many of Marant's designs are derivative, but there's something about them that makes you feel like the coolest kid in class. Add the fact that she produces perilously few of anything and you have fashionista crack. Fortunately, there is much to distract the Isabel addict in northeast Paris. The Canal St-Martin, for one. Hipsters the world over seem to have a thing for canals: Their workhorse pasts and  jolie laide  fit perfectly with the prevailing keeping-it-real youth ethos. In London, there's skinny-jean-thronged Regent's Canal; DJ parties and microbreweries have sprung up beside Brooklyn's murky Gowanus Canal in recent years. Commissioned by Napoleon I to provide Parisians with fresh drinking water, the Canal St-Martin was paid for with a new tax on wine. Later, it became a transportation artery and was threatened with the cement mixer when boat traffic declined in the 1960s. The stalwart little waterway survived, however, and in the last decade it has become the HQ of Paris's personal breed of  'ipster . Flanked by shuttered Haussman-style stone buildings that evolve into modern, graffiti-blooming blocks as it bends northeast, the canal has a gray-green hue that matches the leaves of the plane trees lining it and the patina of the iron bridges which cross it. And standing on one of those bridges on a sunny Saturday afternoon, I got the eyeful I was hoping for. Girls wearing peasant blouses like those I saw in Matisse paintings at the Pompidou (and on the rails of Isabel Marant's nearby store on the rue de Charonne) read paperbacks, their legs listing over the edge of the canal. Gangly guys propped fixie bikes against the bridges and unwrapped baguettes and pâté. The streets branching to the west and east of the canal are fertile ground for boutiques, coffee shops offering free Wi-Fi and a  formule  meal, and wine bars like Le Verre Volé, a relative old-timer (it opened in 2000) where I had a glass of white Burgundy and a perfect plate of sardines while the lunch crowd, a mixture of young arty types and couples  d'un certain âge , yapped around me. An art scene far and away from the one in the Marais (both in distance and substance) is unfolding in the twentieth arrondissement, in working-class Belleville, amid the residential town houses, elementary schools, and cafés bordering the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, a Wordsworth poem come to sprawling life. Belleville has long attracted an arty set, but in the last decade there's been a deliberate attempt to establish a community away from the shiny, commercial, would-you-like-a-Warhol-print-with-your-new-pair-of-shoes, sir, Marais, where, I was told, any sense of solidarity between galleries has been lost. "People go shopping for clothes in the Marais, and they stop in a gallery and buy something, but the art is almost incidental," said Samy Abraham, who opened his own gallery in Belleville two years ago. "You have to make a conscious decision to come to Belleville, so the collectors here are better informed." Rents are cheaper in Belleville, but Abraham said that's not what drew him to the twentieth. "I chose Belleville because I wanted to be close to galleries and gallerists of the same generation as me, to be part of something new," he said, with Gallic verve. "When I arrived here, I immediately felt supported by the other galleries. It's like a collective, and it's exciting." That excitement is discernible in every gallery, and it rubs off. I don't really like conceptual art, which is the prevalent genre here. Most of it leaves me cold, probably because I don't understand it, and the  froideur  gallerists tend to exude doesn't exactly induce me to ask for help. Not so here. Antoine Levi's gallery is the most recent addition to Belleville; he works almost exclusively with under-thirty up-and-comers and insists that every artist's first show is produced within the confines of his one-room space in just ten days. He fizzed with enthusiasm as he talked me through an esoteric group exhibition that included a piece called  Collider —two spheres filled with slime, mounted on EP records, and  Lake Diligence , a folded plastic sheet holding inky water which evaporates as the show progresses. The sheer weirdness of the exhibit and the buoyancy of his delivery left me tingly. Inevitably, some of the inspiration for nouveau northeast Paris has come from the hipster enclaves of the good old U.S.A. and beyond: the  défait  decor and dress; the artisanal cocktail culture; the "have a nice day" service; and the let-it-all-hang-out vibe. But it's not imitation, it's a generational shift: All over the world, the youth are doing it for themselves, creating the environments in which they want to live and work. "I wanted to have a restaurant where people my age felt comfortable, where it didn't matter if you didn't know anything about food and wine, and where I would enjoy spending sixteen hours a day," said thirty-year-old Australian chef James Henry, who opened Bones in January and, incidentally, has never been to Brooklyn. This being Paris, it's perhaps not surprising that the most exciting aspect of the new northeast Paris landscape is the food. Back in the eleventh arrondissement that evening, I found the neo-bistro revolution was adding recruits every couple of months and seemed to have access to a secret cache of chefs and waiters who were bearded and devastatingly, blush-inducingly handsome. Fortunately, this crew does more than go easy on the eye—they can cook, too. Like Le Dauphin, each restaurant is turning up the volume and lowering the tone—I didn't see a white tablecloth all week. But there's nothing affected about the food. At noisy Bones, which opened in January, my  menu dégustation  (accompanied by a reggae sound track) was a tour de force of small seasonal plates that began with a single smoked oyster and ended with a scoop of sublime homemade butter ice cream with strawberries. There wasn't a bad bite. It's not just the young'uns who are breaking with the starchy conventions of the center of Paris and cooking up a storm. Thierry Monassier, who looks a little like a slim-line Gérard Depardieu, started selling sandwiches on the corner of the scruffy rue Keller twenty-five years ago and returned to the street this spring to open Manger, an airy, elegant space hung with pendant lamps fitted with filament bulbs, where I had lunch. "It made sense to open the restaurant here," said Monassier. "I liked the fact that the population of this neighborhood is mixed and multicultural, and it would have been impossible for me to have found a space of this size in the center of the city." Manger's chef, William Pradeleix, who has cooked all over the world, describes his menu as "traveling food." I'd describe it as worth traveling for: My flaky cod served with green curry was one of the best I've had in Paris. These are not your average shove-a-ramp-on-a-plate hipster joints: Everywhere I ate that week, I found a respect for ingredients, presentation (these babies were made for Instagram), and service that just doesn't exist in other creative hinterlands. This is still the city of the career waiter, even if he's wearing a plaid shirt rather than a white apron. The Space Invaders graffiti inking up the shutters on the luminous stone buildings and the occasional heart-lurching sighting of the Bastille reminded me that I couldn't be anywhere but Paris. On the last night of my trip, I had dinner at Chatomat in Belleville—veal carpaccio with cucumber and nasturtium petals followed by lamb with petit pois and leeks that tasted like a tumble in a spring field—then repaired to my hotel bar for a digestif. Mama Shelter is a heavily stylized "urban concept hotel" with decor by Philippe Starck, and it opened a few years ago in the twentieth arrondissement below Père-Lachaise Cemetery, where the graves of Edith Piaf and Jim Morrison almost buckle under the weight of red roses. At 1 A.M. the bar felt like a microcosm of Paris's northern neighborhoods: There was a nine-year-old playing foosball; a brace of sprightly seventy-five-year-olds, their arms draped around each other's necks; plenty of long-limbed lovelies; and everything in between. Wherever I ate, shopped, drank coffee, or unfurled a picnic blanket during my exploration of northeast Paris, I was struck by the open-armed and unintimidating heterogeneous jumble all around me. It was not only a completely different Paris from any of the others I'd experienced but a different hipster animal from its cousins in Hackney, Brooklyn, the Mission, and wherever else youth culture is currently doing its thing. Northeast Paris is throwing the sort of party that everyone wants to be invited to. As it turns out, everyone is. More From  Condé Nast Traveler :
