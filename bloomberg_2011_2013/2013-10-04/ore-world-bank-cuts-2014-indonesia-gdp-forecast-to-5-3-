reflects more subdued outlook for domestic demand as the economy

risks stem from demand being impacted more-than-expected by
higher prices, higher  interest rates ; also stock price and
currency volatility: report

to 2.6% of GDP in 2014: report
* Inflation expected to peak in 4Q, average 7.3% this year and
6.7% in 2014: report
* Monetary policy faces challenge of calibrating interest and
exchange rates to guard against rising inflationary pressures
from the pass-through of the weaker currency and wage increases,
without unduly crimping economic growth and weakening public and
private sector balance sheets: report

demand and external financing conditions: report  To contact the reporter on this story:
