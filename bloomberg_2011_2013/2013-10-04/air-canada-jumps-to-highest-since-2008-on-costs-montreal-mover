Air Canada (AC/B)  surged to the highest
level in almost five years after the nation’s largest carrier
said costs for the third quarter and full year will decline more
than anticipated.  Air Canada (AC/A)   jumped  13 percent to C$4.47 in Toronto, for the
highest closing price since November 2008. The Montreal-based
company’s stock has more than doubled this year.  Costs for each seat flown a mile, a measure of airline
efficiency, will drop 3 percent to 3.5 percent in the third
quarter, Air Canada said in a statement issued yesterday after
the close of trading. In August, the company had predicted a
decline of 1.5 to 2.5 percent. Expense reductions at the airline
include sales and distribution as well as food and beverage.  “Air Canada is in the early stages of a transformational
change which will lead to vastly improved operating metrics --
and ultimately a step-function increase in profitability,”
 Walter Spracklin , an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in Toronto,
said in a note to clients today.  Spracklin recommends investors buy the shares.  Costs for 2013 will probably shrink 1.5 percent to 2
percent compared with 2012, Air Canada said yesterday. The
company had previously expected a decline of 1 percent to 2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
