Japanese  stock futures  held losses
after the  Bank of Japan  issued a statement that it kept monetary
policy unchanged.  Nikkei 225  Stock Average futures traded at 14,095 in
Singapore as of 11:51 a.m. in Tokyo. Before the central bank
announcement, the Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4 percent to 14,095.58 at
the trading break in Tokyo. The broader  Topix index  dropped 0.6
percent to 1,166.92.  Thirty-five of 36 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
forecast no change in policy, with one predicting the central
bank would boost its purchases of Japanese real-estate
investment trusts. Twenty-six said they expect it to add to
unprecedented stimulus in the first half of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
