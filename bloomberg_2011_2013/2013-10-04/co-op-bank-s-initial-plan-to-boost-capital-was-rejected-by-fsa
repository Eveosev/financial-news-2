Co-Operative Bank Plc had an initial
plan to bolster capital rejected by regulators, contributing to
a delay in a second recovery program being agreed with the
customer-owned bank, according to the Prudential Regulation
Authority.  U.K. regulators decided Manchester, England-based Co-Op
Bank may need capital in 2011 and waited until “there was
greater visibility about the possible outcome” over its
intention to buy branches from  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , PRA
Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Bailey  said in a letter to bond
investors seen by  Bloomberg News  today.  Co-Op Bank said in June it will swap some debt for equity
as part of a plan to raise 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) of
capital after the failure of its bid for 632 Lloyds branches
exposed the deficit.  The Financial Services Authority, then banking regulator,
“rejected the first plan produced by management of the Co-op
Bank as inadequate,” wrote Bailey, in answer to a question on
why regulators allowed 18 months to elapse between identifying a
shortfall and a plan being announced. “This led to the current
plan being produced by the new management.”  Russ Brady, a spokesman for the parent Co-Operative Group
Ltd., and an official at the PRA declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
