Guinea ’s main opposition parties
threatened protests over the provisional results of legislative
elections held on Sept. 28, saying voting was marred by fraud
and interference by government and military officials.  “The opposition calls for voting to be canceled and
doesn’t rule out public demonstrations,” spokesman Aboubacar
Sylla told reporters today in the capital, Conakry. President
 Alpha Conde ’s ruling Rally of the Guinean People called for calm
and restraint.  Conde’s party provisionally won the vote yesterday in two
cities, Dubreka and Fria. The results were rejected by the Union
of Republican Force and former Prime Minster Cellou Dalein
Diallo’s Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea.  The world’s biggest exporter of bauxite held its first
legislative elections in 11 years on Sept. 28 amid accusations
from opposition parties that the electoral commission wasn’t
ready. Candidates from 32 parties ran for parliament, which was
dissolved after a military coup that followed the 2008 death of
Lansana Conte. He was in power for 24 years.  Conde was elected in 2010 and a planned vote for the
National Assembly’s 114 seats has been delayed for almost two
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
