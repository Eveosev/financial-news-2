Russian  government bonds  rose for a
third day before inflation data for September that is forecast
to show the pace of price increases slowed toward the central
bank’s target.  The yield on ruble-denominated benchmark debt due February
2027 slipped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.63
percent.  Russia ’s currency traded little changed against the
dollar at 32.1500 by 1:38 p.m. in Moscow, set for a 0.6 percent
gain this week. It was also steady against Bank Rossii’s target
basket of dollars and euros at 37.3714.  Russia’s annual inflation will probably accelerate to 6.2
percent, according to the median estimate of 14 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The rate was 6.5 percent in August. The
central bank, which will hold its monetary policy meeting on
Oct. 14 and may report its Consumer Price Index reading today,
has a target of 5 percent to 6 percent for price increases in
2013.  “We see good chances for new support of long benchmark OFZ
issues as data is released,” Evgeny Koshelev and Alexander Sychev, analysts at OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) , said in an e-mailed note. A
moderation in inflation won’t change the possibility of  interest
rates  being kept on hold at the meeting, “raising chances for
monetary easing at subsequent meetings,” they said in the note.  Oil Climbs  Crude, Russia’s chief export earner, climbed 0.3 percent to
$109.29 per barrel in  London . An index of 20 emerging-market
currencies compiled by Bloomberg rose for a fifth day,
increasing 0.1 percent to 94.44.  Russia’s current-account surplus shrank to $1.1 billion in
the third quarter, compared with $5.83 billion a year ago and
below the median forecast of $8 billion in a Bloomberg survey of
7 economists. The net capital outflow from Russia was $12.9
billion over the three months through September, compared with
$7 billion in the previous quarter, the central bank reported
late yesterday in Moscow.  A worsening balance of payments has already been priced-in
by the  currency market , analysts at ZAO Raiffeisenbank led by
Anastasia Baykova said in an e-mailed note. “In the absence of
any considerable shocks on external markets we don’t think the
pressure on the ruble will increase before the end of the
year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
