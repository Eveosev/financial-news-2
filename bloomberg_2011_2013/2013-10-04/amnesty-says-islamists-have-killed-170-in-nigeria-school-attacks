Boko Haram Islamists in Nigeria
killed at least 170 teachers and students this year in attacks
targeting schools in the northeast, Amnesty International said.  At least 70 teachers and more than 100 students were killed
this year and many others injured, according to a report titled
“Education Under Attack in Nigeria” released today by the
London-based rights group. About 50 schools have been attacked
and more than 60 others have closed for fear of being targeted
too, with more than 1,000 teachers forced to flee the region,
according to the report.  “Attacks against school children, teachers and school
buildings demonstrate an absolute disregard for the right to
life and the right to education,” Amnesty said. “Such attacks
may also constitute crimes against humanity.”  As many as 50 students were killed in an early morning
attack on the dormitory of the Yobe State College of Agriculture
in Gujba, a town about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the state
capital of Damaturu on Sept. 29, authorities said.  Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a sin”
in the Hausa language and aims to overthrow the government to
establish an Islamic state, has killed thousands of people since
2009, mostly in attacks across the mainly Muslim north and the
capital, Abuja. Nigeria’s more than 160 million people are
almost evenly split between Christians, predominant in the
south, and Muslims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
