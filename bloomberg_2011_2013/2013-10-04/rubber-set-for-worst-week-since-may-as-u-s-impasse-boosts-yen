Rubber posted the biggest weekly loss
since May as concern that the U.S. political impasse could lead
to a recession boosted the Japanese currency against the dollar
and cut the appeal of yen-denominated futures.  The contract for March delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange lost 1 percent to 254.3 yen a kilogram ($2,620 a metric
ton), the lowest settlement since Aug. 7. Futures slid 5.9
percent this week, the worst performance for a most-active
contract since the five days through May 24.  The yen climbed to 96.96 per dollar, nearing the highest
level since Aug. 28 reached yesterday. The first partial U.S.
government shutdown in 17 years has delayed three economic data
releases this week, including the Labor Department’s monthly
jobs report, making it harder for investors to check the health
of the world’s largest economy.  “Risk aversion by investors increased, raising demand for
the yen as a haven and spurring sales of futures in Tokyo,”
said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp.  The failure of U.S. lawmakers to pass the budget and avert
a government shutdown fueled concern they won’t be able to agree
on raising the $16.7 trillion debt limit. A U.S. default could
have catastrophic consequences that might last decades, the
Treasury said in a report yesterday.  Thai rubber  free-on-board fell today for an eighth day,
losing 0.3 percent to 78 baht ($2.49) a kilogram, according to
the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand . Markets in  China  are
closed through Oct. 7 for National Day holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
