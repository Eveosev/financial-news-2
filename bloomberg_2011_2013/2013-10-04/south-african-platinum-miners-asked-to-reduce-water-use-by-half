Mines in  South Africa ’s main platinum
producing area, run by companies such as  Anglo American Platinum
Ltd. (AMS) , are being asked to cut water use in half after a drought.  Operations near Rustenburg in North West province “have
been asked to cut their consumption,” Linda Page, a spokeswoman
for the Department of Water Affairs, said today by phone.
“Domestic users should get first preference obviously.”  The province, home to operations of the three biggest
producers including Lonmin Plc, was declared a drought-stricken
area by premier Thandi Modise last month. The companies have
already seen profit margins shrink as prices declined and costs
such as wages have grown faster than the rate of inflation.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the second-largest producer,
was asked to cut fresh water use by 10 percent, spokesman  Johan
Theron  said. The shortage “is something that happens every
summer and every summer it gets worse,” he said today by phone.  Impala’s consumption of fresh water makes up a quarter of
its total usage and mining hasn’t been affected, Theron said.  The water shortage is exacerbated by supply-infrastructure
that hasn’t kept up with growth in Rustenburg, he said.  Anglo American Platinum, Lonmin and Aquarius Platinum Ltd.
weren’t immediately able to comment.  Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM) ’s Zondereinde mine isn’t within
Rustenburg’s municipal borders, Charmane Russell, a spokeswoman
for the company at Russell & Associates, said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
