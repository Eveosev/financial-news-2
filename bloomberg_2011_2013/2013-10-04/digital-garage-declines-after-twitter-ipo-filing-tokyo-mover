Digital Garage Inc. (4819)  fell the most
since August after a Twitter Inc. filing failed to mention the
Tokyo-based company as a shareholder.  Investors were expecting that Twitter would disclose
Digital Garage as a shareholder, David Gibson, an analyst at
Macquarie Securities based in Tokyo said in a telephone
interview. Twitter filed an S-1 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission Oct. 3 in the U.S. that listed major individual
shareholders and institutional shareholders with more than 5
percent stakes.  Previously Gibson said he believed that Digital Garage
owned a 2 percent stake or more in Twitter.  Akari Fukuda, a spokeswoman for Digital Garage based in
Tokyo said the company holds Twitter shares and declined to
identify the size of the stake.  Digital Garage fell 10.4 percent to 2,817 yen at the close
in  Tokyo , the most since Aug. 8. The shares earlier declined
14.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
