Gasoline slipped on speculation
Tropical Storm Karen won’t reduce production from  Gulf Coast 
refineries at a time when inventories are ample.  Futures slipped as much as 0.5 percent. Forecasters no
longer expect Tropical Storm Karen to become a hurricane before
it hits the Gulf Coast near the Alabama-Florida line, which is
east of the cluster of plants around  New Orleans . Nationwide
gasoline  inventories  as of Sept. 27 were 7.4 percent above the
five-year seasonal average, Energy Information Administration
data show.  “It doesn’t seem that this storm is really going to affect
refinery operations to any significant degree,”  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LP in Houston, said by phone.
“Given that inventories are 12 percent higher than this time
last year, the market is not really worried about supply.”  Gasoline for November delivery fell 0.66 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.633 a gallon at 10:08 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 50 percent below the
100-day average.  The system, which has top sustained winds of 60 miles (97
kilometers) per hour, is 275 miles south-southwest of the mouth
of the  Mississippi River  and moving north-northwest at 10 mph.  Inventories of the motor fuel rose 3.5 million barrels to
219.7 million in the week ended Sept. 27. Supplies in PADD 1,
which includes  New York  Harbor, the delivery point for the Nymex
contract, increased 1.56 million barrels to 56 million.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 1 cent to $3.366 a
gallon, the lowest level since Jan. 28 and 41.8 cents below a
year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery slipped 0.22
cent to $3.0011 a gallon on trading volume that was 30 percent
below the 100-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
