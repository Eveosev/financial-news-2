Ethanol rose against gasoline on
concern production of the additive hasn’t increased enough to
refill stockpiles that are at record seasonal lows.  The biofuel’s discount narrowed 3.71 cents to 93.05 cents a
gallon. Output of ethanol jumped 5.2 percent to 875,000 barrels
a day last week, while  inventories  sank a third week to 15.5
million barrels, 0.4 percent higher than the all-time low on
June 28, Energy Information Administration data show.  “The inventory story has some whiskers,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “The market’s
waiting for that first big pop in stocks to show up.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery advanced 0.8  cent,
or 0.5 percent, to $1.68 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Gasoline for November delivery fell 2.91 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.6105 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The additive is made mostly from corn in the U.S. The
harvest for the grain is under way until November.  About 12 percent was collected as of Sept. 27, up from 7
percent the previous week,  data  from the U.S. Agriculture
Department show.  Kitt said he expects ethanol prices to slide as more corn
becomes available and companies boost output.  “The die is kind of cast here,” he said.  Corn for December delivery gained 1.25 cents to $4.4025 a
bushel in Chicago. The December corn crush spread of corn to
ethanol was 1 cent, up from break-even yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
