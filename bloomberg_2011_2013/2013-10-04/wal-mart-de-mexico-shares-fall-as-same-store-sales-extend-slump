Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB , Latin
America’s biggest retailer, fell to a one-month low after the
company said same-store sales declined last month.  The shares sank 0.7 percent to 33.20 pesos at 12:41 p.m. in
Mexico City, set for the lowest closing level since Sept. 6. The
IPC index of 35 Mexican companies rose 0.4 percent today.  Sales at Mexico stores open at least a year fell 4.7
percent in September, the fifth decline in six months and a
reading Credit Suisse Group AG said was the worst drop on record
through 1999. Walmex had 4.8 percent fewer customers in the
period, the company said yesterday in a regulatory filing.
Walmex shoppers increased spending by 0.1 percent in September,
a measure known as average ticket, which was slower than the
annual  inflation  rate of 3.46 percent.  “The new concerning trend seems to be average ticket,”
Credit Suisse analysts including Antonio Gonzalez and Armando Perez wrote in a report yesterday. Credit Suisse has an
underperform recommendation on Walmex, and it had projected a
3.5 percent contraction in same-store sales.  Walmex said it opened 12 stores in September, including 11
in  Mexico  and one in El Salvador.  To contact the reporter on this story:
