Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ’s banking
unit set up an internal committee and will assemble a panel of
outside experts to improve compliance after it failed to act on
loans made to crime groups.  Deputy President Toshitsugu Okabe told reporters of the
measures after bowing in apology at a news conference in  Tokyo 
today. It was the first briefing by  Japan ’s third-biggest bank
by market value since the Financial Services Agency ordered the
lending unit to improve business a week ago.  Mizuho Bank Ltd. failed to take steps to end loans to
“anti-social” groups for more than two years after becoming
aware of them, the FSA said Sept. 27. Okabe said today that at
least four senior executives responsible for compliance at the
time knew of the transactions and didn’t inform superiors.  Okabe replaced Masakane Koike as head of compliance at the
holding company on Sept. 30, and Yasunori Tsujita took over
Koike’s equivalent role at the banking unit on the same day, the
Tokyo-based bank said this week.  Mizuho Bank made all 230 transactions, which totaled about
200 million yen ($2 million), through its  Orient Corp. (8585)  consumer
credit affiliate, Okabe said today.  Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said at a separate
briefing that Mizuho’s violation was regrettable and urged it to
take necessary actions to operate appropriately.  The company must submit a report to the FSA by Oct. 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
