South African yellow corn futures
declined for the first time in three sessions on the South
African Futures Exchange. The white variety was unchanged.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, dropped 0.4 percent to 2,151 rand ($215) a metric ton
in Johannesburg. The white variety for delivery in the same
month was unchanged at 2,370 rand a ton.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn,
also called maize. A meal made from white corn is one of South
Africa’s staple foods and the yellow variety is mostly fed to
animals.  Wheat for delivery in December closed little changed at
3,438 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
