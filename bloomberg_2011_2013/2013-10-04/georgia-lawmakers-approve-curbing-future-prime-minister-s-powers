Georgian lawmakers approved a
constitutional amendment proposed by billionaire Prime Minister
Bidzina Ivanishvili’s ruling coalition that curbs the powers for
future prime ministers.  The motion was unanimously approved in the third and final
reading by the 103 of the 150 deputies present, according to a
broadcast of the meeting on state television from Kutaisi,
 Georgia . The amendment, which will take effect after this
month’s presidential election, restricts the premier’s power to
change cabinet members and gives parliament a greater role in
passing laws including the budget.  Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili’s party was
unexpectedly defeated by Ivanishvili’s Georgian Dream coalition
in last year’s parliamentary elections.  The ruling alliance’s presidential candidate, Giorgi Margvelashvili, is in the lead before the Oct. 27 vote, with 43
percent support among likely voters, according to a Sept. 15-21
 survey  by the polling company Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. Davit Bakradze of Saakashvili’s United National Movement had 22
percent backing, according to the poll of 1,204 Georgians, which
has a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
