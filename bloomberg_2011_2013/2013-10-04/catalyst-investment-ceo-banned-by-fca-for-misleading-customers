The U.K. financial watchdog
criticized Catalyst Investment Group Ltd., and banned its chief
executive officer, Timothy Roberts, for misleading customers
when promoting bonds from ARM Asset Backed Securities SA.  The Financial Conduct Authority said in an e-mailed
statement today that the firm is unable to pay a fine of 450,000
pounds ($723,000) for “recklessly misleading investors”
between 2009 and 2010. Catalyst failed to tell investors that
Luxembourg-based ARM didn’t have a licence from its regulator to
issue bonds, the FCA said.  “Catalyst showed a reckless disregard for investors’
interests, exposing them to significant risks,” Tracey McDermott, the FCA’s director of enforcement, said in the
statement. “We expect firms, and their senior managers, to put
customers’ needs first -- and will take tough action against
those who fall short of our standards.”  Investors in the U.K. invested 54 million pounds in ARM
bonds and “may lose a significant part of their investment,”
the FCA said.  In addition to the corporate fine, Roberts was also told to
pay a 450,000-pound penalty. The watchdog also issued fines of
100,000 pounds to Andrew Wilkins, Catalyst’s former finance
director, and 20,000 pounds to Alison Moran, the firm’s former
compliance officer.  Roberts and Wilkins are appealing the decision to a London
financial tribunal, said Lara Joseph, a spokeswoman for the FCA.  Calls to telephone numbers listed for Catalyst seeking
comment weren’t connected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
