Brazil ’s real headed for the biggest
rally among major currencies this week as the U.S. government
shutdown added to speculation the  Federal Reserve  will sustain a
stimulus program that has buoyed emerging-market assets.  The real climbed 2 percent from Sept. 27 to 2.2088 per U.S.
dollar as of 10:18 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the biggest weekly gain
among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It was down
0.1 percent today. Swap rates on the contracts maturing in
January 2016 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
10.99 percent, paring their drop this week to six basis points.  “Given the budget problem in the U.S., the Fed should
delay any plans to take away monetary stimulus,”  Reginaldo Galhardo , a currency manager at Treviso Corretora de Cambio in
Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview. “That helps investors
seek a bit more risk.”  The real also rallied this week as Brazil’s central bank
maintained a $60 billion intervention program to support the
currency and curb inflation by limiting import prices. The real
has climbed 10 percent since the program was announced Aug. 22,
a day after the currency touched a 4 1/2-year low. That is the
biggest gain among all of the currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  canceled plans to attend two
economic summits in Asia as the partial government shutdown
entered a fourth day amid wrangling by lawmakers over the budget
and debt ceiling.  To contact the reporters on this story:
