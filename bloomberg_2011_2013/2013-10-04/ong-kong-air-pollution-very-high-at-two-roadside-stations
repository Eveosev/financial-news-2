Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at two of the city’s roadside-monitoring
stations, according to data from the Environmental Protection
Department’s website.  The index was 124 in Causeway Bay and 119 at the Mong Kok
station as of 8 a.m. local time.  A reading of more than 100
triggers a government warning for people with heart or
respiratory illnesses to avoid prolonged stays in heavy-traffic
areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
