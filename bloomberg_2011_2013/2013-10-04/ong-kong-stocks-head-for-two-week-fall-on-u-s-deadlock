Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index heading for a two-week decline, as concern grew
that U.S. political deadlock could lead to a recession in the
world’s biggest economy.  The  Hang Seng Index  lost 0.9 percent to 23,013.62 as of
9:32 in Hong Kong, with all but three shares falling on the 50-member gauge. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also known
as the H-share index, slid 1.1 percent to 10,395.71. Mainland
markets are shut until Oct. 8.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  last week capped its biggest quarterly
gain since March 2012, rising 9.9 percent on better-than-expected Chinese data and after the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly
refrained from cutting stimulus. Hong Kong’s equity benchmark
traded at 11.12 times estimated earnings yesterday, compared
with 15.12 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500  slid 0.1 percent today. The index
fell the most in a month yesterday as the Treasury Department
said the government will run out of borrowing authority Oct. 17.
It also warned that if lawmakers failed to raise the $16.7
trillion debt limit, a default could lead to a recession as bad
as the 2008 financial crisis or worse.  Service industries  in the
U.S. expanded in September at a slower pace than forecast.  U.S. payrolls data won’t be released as scheduled today
because of the shutdown. A dearth of economic data caused by
the stoppage is making it harder for the central bank to gauge
when to start paring a record $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases.  Hong Kong’s retail sales by value rose 8.1 percent in
August from a year earlier, missing analysts estimates for a
10.1 percent increase. Sales volume rose 7.2 percent, also short
of expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
