The Malaysia state investment fund
Khazanah Nasional Bhd acquired almost 5 percent of  Beijing
Enterprises Water Group Ltd. (371)  for $152 million to expand in
 China , making it the companyâ€™s third-largest shareholder.  Beijing Enterprises Water plans to use the net proceeds for
working capital, the sovereign wealth fund said today in a
statement. The water-treatment group announced 400 million new
shares would be issued at HK$2.95 each to Mount Reskit
Investments Ltd., a unit of Khazanah Nasional, last month.  The Malaysian investment is taking place as China faces
rising demand for water, in quantity and quality, and water
pollution and scarcity issues become more acute due to
population growth and urbanization, the fund said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
