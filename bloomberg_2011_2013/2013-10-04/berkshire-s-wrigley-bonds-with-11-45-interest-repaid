Mars Inc. said it retired
$4.4 billion in bonds that  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. bought in 2008 when he helped the candy company acquire Wm.
Wrigley Jr. Co.  The maker of M&M’s candies was paying  11.45 percent  on the
notes, which were due in 2018. Mars had the right to end the
arrangement with a prepayment premium.  Buffett backed Mars’s $23 billion purchase of the chewing
gum maker in October 2008 with the debt financing and an
agreement to take a $2.1 billion stake in the Wrigley division.
Closely held Mars joins Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  General
Electric Co. (GE)  and Swiss Re Ltd. in repaying Berkshire for
investments made during periods when Buffett was able to charge
historically high interest rates.  “Since Wrigley’s acquisition by Mars in 2008 we have on a
number of occasions refinanced portions of our debt in order to
take advantage of our improved credit rating and lower  interest
rates ,” Ryan Bowling, a spokesman for McLean, Virginia-based
Mars, said in an e-mailed statement. He said the notes were
repaid Oct. 1 and that Berkshire remains a minority investor in
Wrigley, while declining to comment further.  The repayment was reported earlier today by the Wall Street
Journal, which said Mars bought back the securities at 115.45
percent of face value, a premium of about $680 million. Buffett
didn’t return a message left with an assistant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
