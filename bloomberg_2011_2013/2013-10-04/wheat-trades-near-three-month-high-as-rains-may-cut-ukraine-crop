Soybean futures rose for the third
straight day on signs that August rain failed to boost crop
yields in the U.S., the world’s biggest producer. Corn gained,
while wheat dropped.  Informa Economics Inc., based in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , cut
its forecast today for soybean output by 1.5 percent to 3.176
billion bushels from a Sept. 20 estimate, partly because crop
 conditions  deteriorated last month. The harvest was 11 percent
completed as of Sept. 29, trailing the five-year average,
government data showed.  “Informa’s crop forecast came in a little lower than
people expected,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities
Inc. in West Des Moines,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview.
“Prices also gained as Midwest rain delaying the harvest is
keeping supplies from getting to processors and exporters,
boosting some cash bids.”  Soybean futures for November delivery gained 0.5 percent to
close at $12.95 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, capping a three-day rally of 2.1 percent.  Stockpiles from last year’s crop were 141 million bushels,
down from 169 million a year earlier and the smallest since
2009, the USDA said on Sept. 30. U.S. output may be 3.15 billion
bushels, 4.4 percent more than last year, the agency estimates.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 0.9 percent to
$4.4325 a bushel. This week, the price dropped 2.4 percent. The
USDA said on Sept. 12 that farmers would harvest a record 13.84
billion bushels.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$6.87 a bushel. The price climbed 0.6 percent this week as
excess rain reduced winter-crop planting in Ukraine and  Russia .  The USDA’s scheduled monthly update on Oct. 11 for domestic
and global estimates of supply and demand may be delayed by an
extended shutdown of the federal government. The agency has
suspended daily reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
