Air France-KLM Group (AF) ’s Air France
unit will eliminate 1,826 ground staff jobs through voluntary
employee departures as it put off a decision about pilots and
cabin crew.  The moves, aimed chiefly at fixing weaknesses in short-and
medium-haul flights and cargo, were announced today to union
representatives. The targets are 582 cuts at Paris’s Charles de
Gaulle airport and 128 at the secondary Orly airport, 591 at
French provincial airports and 282 in freight, the unit’s chief
executive officer, Frederic Gagey, said in a statement.  “Transform 2015 is working and our initial efforts are
beginning to pay off,” Gagey said in the statement, referring
to the carrier’s restructuring plan. “We need to continue and
intensify our actions.”  Today’s disclosures were the first details on how Air
France would reach a goal of shedding 2,800 jobs as  Europe ’s
economic slump drags the unit toward a sixth straight annual
loss. Gagey and Air France-KLM CEO Alexandre de Juniac are
trimming frequencies, shifting flights and extending cuts
initiated earlier.  The airline said it still has 350 more pilots than it needs
and 700 more cabin crew, and measures to deal with that over-staffing “will be presented later.” Air France announced 5,100
job cuts last year.  The Air France unit won’t make a profit this year, the
company announced Sept. 18. The Paris-based parent company,
helped by better performance at KLM, still expects an operating
profit for 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
