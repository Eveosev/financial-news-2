Citizens Financial Group Inc., the
U.S. subsidiary of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , is
exploring the sale of its Chicago branches, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  Citizens is working with Bank of America Corp. on
attracting offers, said the people, who asked not to be named
because the process is private. The Providence, Rhode Island-based lender had 105 branches in Chicago that held almost $6
billion in deposits as of June 30, according to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.  RBS,  majority-owned  by the U.K. government, said this year
that it would begin preparing to take Citizens Financial public
by about 2015. The U.S. lender has $126 billion in assets and
operates about 1,300 branches in 12 states, according to its
website.  Citizens “does not comment on marketplace speculation or
rumors,” Jim Hughes, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. John Yiannacopoulos, a spokesman for Bank of America,
declined to comment. Crain’s Chicago Business earlier reported
the sale of the Chicago branches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
