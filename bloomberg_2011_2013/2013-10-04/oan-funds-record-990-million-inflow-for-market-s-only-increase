Investors added $990 million this
week to funds that purchase leveraged loans in the U.S., the
only asset class to record an increase, according to Bank of
America Corp.  The inflow into floating-rate funds is up from $360 million
the previous week, according to the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank. Deposits into high-yield bond funds fell to $870
million from $2.94 billion last week.  “Fund flows tapered during the week characterized by the
markets trading sideways and the government shutdown
uncertainties,” Bank of America analysts wrote in a report
yesterday. Flows into high-grade bonds fell from the previous
week, while equity-fund flows were flat and emerging-market bond
funds reported a small outflow, according to the report.  Loan-fund deposits have increased 73 percent this year,
bringing the total amount under management to $55 billion,
according to Bank of America. Senior-ranking bank debt has
 returned  about 3.24 percent so far this year, according to the
Standard & Poor’s/LSTA Leveraged Loan 100 Index.  Investors have made deposits into loan mutual funds every
week this year, Bank of America data show. Leveraged loans are a
form of high-risk debt that carry ratings of less than Baa3 by
Moody’s Investors Service and below BBB- at S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
