BlackRock’s  Larry Fink  and Pacific
Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  said the U.S. debt
standoff will be resolved without a default.  The congressional dispute will be resolved “very
rapidly,” Fink said today at a Beverly Hills,  California , event
hosted by the UCLA Anderson School of Management at the Beverly
Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, California.  “It’s theatrics posed by politicians to get ratings or to
get their way via legislation,” Gross said. “It’s not a
realistic proposition.”  The budget standoff between congressional Republicans and
Democrats has led to a partial government shutdown this week and
risks a U.S. debt default. The government will run out of
borrowing authority Oct. 17, according to the Treasury
Department, which said a default caused by Congress failing to
raise the $16.7 trillion federal debt limit could have
catastrophic consequences that might last decades.  The  yield  on the 10-year U.S. Treasury touched a seven-week
low today and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell the most in a
month as the budget deadlock persisted into a third day. U.S.
Treasuries lost 2.4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
