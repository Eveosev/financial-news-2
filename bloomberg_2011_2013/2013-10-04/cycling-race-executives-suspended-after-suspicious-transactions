The company that organizes the Giro
d’Italia, one of cycling’s biggest races, suspended three
executives after some “suspicious banking transactions.”  RCS Sport, which runs the race won this year by Italy’s
Vincenzo Nibali, suspended former Chief Executive Officer
Giacomo Catano and two others as a precaution, it said today in
an e-mailed statement.  The managers “were suspended temporarily as a cautionary
measure considering the importance of their roles,” RCS said
today. The company started an audit about a week ago that turned
up suspicious activity, it said.  The Giro is one of the so-called Grand Tours, along with
the Tour de  France  and the Vuelta a Espana. The route for the
2014 Italian race will be revealed next week.  Michele Acquarone, managing director of RCS Sport, who
oversees the Giro among other sports events, was among the
executives suspended, the  Associated Press  said. The  news agency 
said at least $17.7 million was allegedly misappropriated.  Acquarone said by telephone today that he couldn’t comment
on his situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
