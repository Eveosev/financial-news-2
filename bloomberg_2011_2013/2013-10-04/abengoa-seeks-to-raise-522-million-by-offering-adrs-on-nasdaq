Abengoa SA (ABG) , the largest developer of
solar-thermal power plants, is seeking to raise about 385
million euros ($522 million) by offering American depositary
receipts that will trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  The company, based in Seville,  Spain , plans to offer 182.5
million ADRs, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission today. It estimated the value of the
offering on yesterday’s closing price of its Class B shares of
2.19 euros, minus fees. Each ADR will be worth five Class B
shares traded in Spain.  The company will use the proceeds to repay debt and shore
up its balance sheet, according to the filing. Abengoa’s market
value has declined 7.2 percent this year to 1.2 billion euros.  Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Banco Santander SA, Bank
of America Corp., Cannacord Genuity Group Inc. and Societe
General SA are underwriting the offering.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
