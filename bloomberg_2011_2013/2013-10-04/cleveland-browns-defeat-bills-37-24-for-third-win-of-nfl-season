The  Cleveland Browns  overcame the
loss of quarterback Brian Hoyer to a knee injury in the first
quarter to beat the  Buffalo Bills  37-24.  Cleveland, which scored the last 20 points of the game,
improved to 3-2 for its first winning record through five games
of a National Football League season since 2001. The Bills
dropped to 2-3 with their sixth straight loss on the road.  Buffalo took the lead at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland
last night on its third play when Fred Jackson ran for a
touchdown from one yard.  Hoyer left the game after scrambling on Cleveland’s second
drive. Hoyer, who was replaced by  Brandon Weeden , was taken to a
hospital for a scan to determine whether he damaged a ligament,
the NFL Network said during its game broadcast. Hoyer was
seeking to become the first Browns quarterback to win his first
three starts for the team since Otto Graham in 1946.  After Dan Carpenter kicked a 52-yard field goal for Buffalo
and  Billy Cundiff  responded with a 30-yard field goal for
Cleveland 32 seconds into the second quarter, the Bills twice
stopped Willis McGahee on their 1-yard line before he breached
the defensive line on the third attempt to tie the game at
10-10.  Cleveland led 17-10 a minute later after Travis Benjamin
returned a punt 79 yards for a touchdown. Benjamin finished with
a franchise-record 179 yards on seven punt returns.  It was tied again three plays into the third quarter as
C.J. Spiller sprinted 54 yards for a touchdown and Jackson
scored on another one-yard touchdown run on the Bills’ next
possession to make it 24-17.  A minute later Weeden found Josh Gordon, who was suspended
the first two games of the season for violating the NFL’s drug
policy, with a 37-yard touchdown pass to tie it again at 24-24.  Cundiff kicked field goals of 24 and 44 yards in the fourth
quarter to give the Browns the lead for good, and  Cleveland  made
certain of the win when T.J. Ward returned an interception 44
yards for a touchdown with 1:54 remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
