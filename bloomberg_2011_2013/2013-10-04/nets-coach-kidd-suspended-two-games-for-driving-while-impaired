Brooklyn Nets coach  Jason Kidd  was
suspended for the first two games of the National Basketball
Association season after pleading guilty to driving while
ability impaired after he crashed into a utility pole on Long
Island last year.  Kidd was charged with misdemeanor driving while intoxicated
during summer 2012 after the accident in in Southampton, New
York. He pleaded guilty in July to driving while ability
impaired.  “The decision is consistent with what the league has done
in the past,” Nets General Manager Billy King said today in an
e-mailed statement.  Kidd, 40, was hired by the Nets in June, nine days after
ending a 19-year playing career. As an NBA point guard he
compiled 12,091 assists and 2,684 steals -- trailing only Hall
of Famer John Stockton in each category -- and was selected as
an All-Star 10 times. He played with the Nets from 2001-08,
helping the team to back-to-back NBA Finals appearances in 2002
and 2003.  This offseason the Nets acquired  Kevin Garnett  and  Paul Pierce  from the Boston Celtics, a duo with 25 combined All-Star
appearances and an NBA title playing together. The Nets gave up
three first-round draft picks in the trade and received guard
Jason Terry.  The Nets open their season Oct. 30 on the road against the
 Cleveland Cavaliers . Kidd will also miss the team’s home opener
two days later against  LeBron James  and the defending champion
Miami Heat. He will make his regular season coaching debut Nov.
3 against the Orlando Magic.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporters on this story:
