Magnums of Petrus and Le Pin from the
Pomerol estates’ 2009 vintage, along with cases of 1982 Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild and Domaine Dujac 1990 Burgundy led a Hart
Davis Hart Wine Co. Chicago wine sale that fetched $5 million.  Six Petrus ’09 magnums were the top-priced lot at $47,800
at the two-day event late last month, within the auction house’s
estimated presale range. It was Hart Davis Hart’s fifth sale of
this year, taking its total of wine sold so far to $25 million,
with two auctions remaining before the end of December.  The demand for rarer Bordeaux and older Burgundy vintages
at auction is in contrast to the muted appetite in recent months
for more widely-available Bordeaux wines on the investment
market. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of the region’s top
growers has risen 2 percent this year, still leaving the decline
since the peak of the market in June 2011 at 29 percent.  “If you look at some of the premium brands like first-growth Bordeaux, the slowdown’s already happened,” Tom Gearing,
director of Cult Wines Ltd., a wine-investment company based in
Richmond,  England , said in an interview with  Guy Johnson  on
Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” last month. “Now’s the
time to be looking at opportunities in the market.”  Vintage Petrus  Other leading lots in the  Hart Davis Hart  sale included a
case of Lafite ’82, which sold for $41,825 including buyer’s
premium, two other cases of the same wine at $35,850 each and
six magnums of Le Pin 2009, which also went for $35,850. A lot
comprising three magnums of Petrus ’09 and another containing
six bottles of the same estate’s 2000 vintage each sold for
$23,900, according to a statement from the auction house.  Among top Burgundy wines in the auction, a case of 1990
Bonnes-Mares, Domaine Dujac and a separate 12-bottle lot of
Dujac’s 1990 Clos de la Roche each sold for $23,900, while a
case of Clos Saint-Denis 1990 Domaine Dujac fetched $22,705.  Petrus, Le Pin and Domaine Dujac are all growers with small
production, adding a rarity premium to the price of their wines.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
