Gold fell for the fourth time this
week on speculation that that the effect of the partial U.S.
government shutdown will be short-lived, crimping demand for the
metal as a store of value.  The shutdown entered the fourth day amid wrangling by
lawmakers over the budget and debt limit.  Bill Gross  of Pacific
Investment Management Co. and BlackRock Inc.’s Laurence D. Fink
said the deadlock will be resolved soon, limiting damage to the
economy. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of equities climbed as
much as 0.8 percent.  “Money seems to be chasing equities,” Phil Streible, a
senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview. “Gold does not seem to be
attracting the safe-haven premium.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to
settle at $1,309.90 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price swung between gains and losses,
climbing as much 0.6 percent.  “The raw emotion of this market creates snap trades, which
do not define anything,” Peter Hug, the global trading director
of Kitco Metals Inc. in  Montreal , said in a report.  As many as 800,000 U.S. federal employees are temporarily
out of work. Congress also faces a dispute over raising the
$16.7 trillion debt ceiling this month.  Gold, down 2.2 percent this week, has slumped 22 percent in
2013 as equities rallied to a record and inflation remained low.  Silver futures for December delivery declined 0.2 percent
to $21.752 an ounce. The price has dropped 28 percent this year.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery advanced 1.1 percent to $1,388 an ounce. The
metal has declined 10 percent this year.  Palladium futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$701.95 an ounce. This week, the price dropped 4.1 percent, the
most since late June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
