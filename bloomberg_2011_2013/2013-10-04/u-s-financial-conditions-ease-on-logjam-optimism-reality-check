Financial conditions in the U.S. rose
from the lowest level in a month as a partial government
shutdown entered a fourth day and optimism mounted that
Washington lawmakers would reach a deal to end the budget
standoff.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS)  increased to
1.28 at 3:42 p.m. in New York after falling to 1.21 yesterday,
the lowest since Sept. 3. The gauge, which is up from 0.31 at
the end of 2012, measures stress in the markets by combining
everything from money-market rates to yields on government and
corporate bonds to volatility in equities. During the debt-ceiling debate of August 2011, it fell as low as negative 1.631.  Lawmakers continue to wrangle with the government poised to
run out of borrowing authority Oct. 17.  Bill Gross  of Pacific
Investment Management Co. and  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s  Larry Fink  said
the deadlock over the  federal budget  and debt limit will be
resolved soon. House Speaker John Boehner said the way to reopen
the government is for Democrats to negotiate with him and accept
changes to the Affordable Care Act.  “Most people in the market think that we will avoid a
debt-ceiling debacle, and for good reason, because the
alternative would be too awful to contemplate,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive and co-chief investment officer at Pimco,
said today in a Bloomberg Television interview with  Betty Liu .
“The pressure is building, because this is not a way to run a
government.”  The first partial shutdown since 1996 may cost the U.S. at
least $300 million a day in lost economic output at the start,
according to  IHS Inc. (IHS)  Though that’s a fraction of the country’s
$15.7 trillion economy, the effects may multiply as consumers
and businesses defer purchases and expansion plans.  Treasury Yields  The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose
4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.65 percent at
3:42 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The yield is down from the high this year of 3 percent
on Sept. 6 and compares with the average of 3.53 percent during
the past decade.  Rates on Treasury bills that mature Oct. 24 closed at 0.12
percent after touching negative 0.01 percent on Sept. 27. Two
years ago, one-month bills climbed to a 29-month high of 0.18
percent as the Aug. 2, 2011, deadline set by Treasury to avoid a
default approached.  Money managers are getting out of Treasuries maturing
closest to the debt-ceiling deadline and buying longer-maturity
bills, yields indicate.  One-month rates  touched 0.19 percent
today, matching a 45-month high reached in November 2012, while
rates on  three-month bills  were 0.02 percent and touched the
biggest inversion of the spread since September 2008.  Rate Derivatives  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt market stress, fell 0.73 basis point to 13.08 basis points.
The gauge narrows when investors favor assets such as company
debentures and widens when they seek the perceived safety of
government securities.  Credit  A gauge of U.S. company credit risk fell. The Markit CDX
North American Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness,
decreased 1.3 basis points to a mid-price of 79.5 basis points
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
index, which typically falls as investor confidence in credit
improves and rises as it deteriorates, has ranged over the past
three months from as high as 88.2 on July 5 to as low as 68.2 on
Sept. 18.  Currencies  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the
performance of the greenback against 10 leading global
currencies, rose 0.2 percent to 1,009.99. The index has traded
in a range of 1,006.4 and 1,056.3 the past three months.  The dollar appreciated 0.47 percent to $1.3555 per euro in
New York, after yesterday reaching the weakest since Feb. 4. The
U.S. currency increased to 97.44 yen.  Japan ’s currency gained
0.29 percent to 132.07 per euro.  Stocks  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.71 percent to
1,690.51 in New York. The Dow rose 76.1 points, or 0.51 percent,
to 15,072.58.  Volatility  The  CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , or VIX, declined 4.3 percent to
16.91, compared with its high for the year of 20.49 in June and
low of 11.3 in March. Volatility in Treasuries as measured by
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE index fell to 80.33
yesterday, compared with the average for the past year of 69.2.  Energy, Commodities  West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery
rose 29 cents to $103.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. WTI averaged $105.81 from July through September, the
highest since 2008 and 12 percent more than the previous three
months. Prices increased 6 percent last quarter.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.53 percent to
$1,310.60 an ounce on the Comex. Gold prices have tumbled 22
percent this year, heading for the first annual loss since 2000.  Copper futures for delivery in December gained 0.96 percent
to $3.30 a pound on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
