Cleveland  Browns quarterback Brian Hoyer will miss the rest of the National Football League season
after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee
during last night’s game.  There was no other ligament damage, and Hoyer will have
season-ending surgery, Browns coach Rob Chudzinski said today.  Hoyer, 27, was injured following an 11-yard scramble in the
first quarter of the team’s 37-24 victory over the Buffalo
Bills. As he slid to avoid a tackle from Bills linebacker Kiko
Alonso, his right knee got caught in the turf, forcing his body
to roll over his leg at an awkward angle.  The team’s third-string quarterback at the beginning of the
season, Hoyer took over as Cleveland’s starter after  Brandon Weeden  was injured. Hoyer led the team to wins over the
Minnesota Vikings and division-rival Cincinnati Bengals,
throwing for 615 yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions
prior to his injury.  Weeden, 29, threw for 197 yards and a score yesterday after
replacing Hoyer. He will return to his starting duties.  The Browns are 3-2, in first place in the American Football
Conference North division. The team has won three straight games
since trading running back Trent Richardson to the  Indianapolis
Colts .  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporters on this story:
