Austria’s economy, driven by exports
and buoyed by  government spending , is set to beat analyst
expectations next year, the state-supported Wifo research
institute said.  The Alpine country’s gross domestic product, the sum of all
goods and services, will expand 1.7 percent in 2014 after 0.4
percent growth this year, the Vienna-based group said in a
report. Analysts predict 0.4 percent growth this year followed
by a 1.5 percent expansion in 2014, according to 13 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The uncertainties in the financial markets have eased
somewhat and companies are more optimistic about future
developments,” Wifo said in the report. It’s the second time
that the institute has adjusted its projections. Wifo saw 1.8
percent in 2014 growth in March before cutting its forecast to
1.6 percent in June.  Austrians, who enjoy  Europe ’s lowest unemployment rate and
were named among the happiest people in the world by a United
Nations study, elected a new parliament this week. The nation’s
economy is driven by manufacturing exports, about a third of
which go to  Germany . Companies like high-quality steelmaker
 Voestalpine AG (VOE)  and hydro-turbine maker  Andritz AG (ANDR)  are global
leaders in their industries, even if not household names.  Exports will climb 5.5 percent in 2014 after a 2.5 percent
rise this year, according to Wifo. Private consumption will
recover, growing 0.9 percent in 2014 after stagnating this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
