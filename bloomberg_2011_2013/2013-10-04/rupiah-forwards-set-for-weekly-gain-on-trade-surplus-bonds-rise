Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards headed
for a weekly gain after data showed the nation’s trade balance
swung into the first surplus in five months and inflation
slowed. Government bonds advanced.  Exports exceeded imports by  $132.4 million  in August, after
falling short by a record $2.3 billion the previous month,
official data showed Oct. 1. Overseas sales still fell for a
17th month and inward shipments contracted 5.7 percent.
Consumer-price gains eased to 8.4 percent in September, from a
four-year high of 8.79 percent the month before, a separate
report published on the same day showed.  “We saw one month of improvement, which shored up the
currency, but it isn’t a shift in the trend yet,” Andy Ji, a
Singapore-based currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of
 Australia . “Expecting a sustainable trade surplus or a current-account surplus is premature at this point without seeing
exports pick up.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards on the rupiah rose 0.3
percent this week to 11,419 per dollar as of 9:15 a.m. in
Jakarta, the biggest gain since the five days ended Sept. 13,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts traded 1.3
percent stronger than the onshore spot rate, which fell 0.2
percent from Sept. 27 to 11,563 per dollar, prices from local
banks show. The forwards declined 0.1 percent today as the spot
rate weakened 0.3 percent.  A daily fixing used to settle the contracts was set at
11,281 per dollar yesterday, from 11,296 on Sept. 27, according
to the Association of Banks in  Singapore . One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, fell for a fourth week. The gauge dropped
131 basis points from Sept. 27 to 15.43 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 declined 28 basis points, or 0.28 percentage point, this
week to 8.11 percent, the biggest drop since the five days ended
Sept. 13, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
