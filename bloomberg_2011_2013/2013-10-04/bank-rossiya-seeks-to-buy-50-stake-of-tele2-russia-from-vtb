Two Bank Rossiya units applied for
antitrust approval to buy as much as 50 percent of mobile-phone
operator Tele2  Russia  from VTB Group after the state-controlled
lender agreed to acquire it for $3.6 billion in March.  Invintel BV asked for the right to buy as much as 40
percent and ABR Management BV applied for 10 percent of Russia’s
fourth-largest mobile operator, a Federal Anti-Monopoly Service
press official, who asked not to be identified in line with the
regulator’s policy, said today by phone. The competition
watchdog will decide on the bids within 30 days after the
application was submitted.  The companies are affiliated with Bank Rossiya, according
to the lender’s website. The bank is 38 percent owned by Yury Kovalchuk, an ally of President  Vladimir Putin .  VTB First Deputy Presient Yuri Soloviev said Oct. 1 that
the state-owned bank planned to divest a “substantial” stake
in Tele2 Russia “within weeks.” The sale will help Russia’s
second-biggest lender reach its profit target this year,
Soloviev said the next day.  OAO Gazprombank and OAO Surgutneftegas may join Bank
Rossiya in the deal to acquire Russia’s fourth-largest wireless
operator, Vedomosti newspaper reported on Oct. 2, citing
unidentified sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
