Dusty Baker  was fired as manager of
the Cincinnati Reds three days after the Major League Baseball
team’s playoff loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.  “This was a very difficult decision to make,” Reds
General Manager Walt Jocketty said in a statement on the team’s
website. “We feel a change is necessary, however, if we are to
continue to move the organization forward.”  Baker, 64, spent six years in Cincinnati, going 509-463 in
the regular season. The Reds reached the playoffs in three of
the past four years without advancing.  Cincinnati finished third in the National League Central
Division this season with a 90-72 record. The team earned the
second of two wild-card spots in the playoffs, where it lost in
Pittsburgh 6-2 on Oct. 1.  Baker had one season left on a two-year contract he signed
after last season, according to MLB.com. The team didn’t
announce any changes to the rest of the coaching staff.  Baker also has managed the San Francisco Giants and  Chicago
Cubs  and was named the NL Manager of the Year three times. His
1,671 career wins were second among active managers, trailing
only  Jim Leyland ’s 1,769.  To contact the reporters on this story:
