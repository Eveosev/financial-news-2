David Herro’s  Oakmark International
Fund (OAKIX) , which has more than doubled in size this year, will close
to some new investors to preserve returns at the top-performing
stock fund.  The change will immediately affect new investors at most
third-party intermediaries, Chicago-based Harris Associates LP,
adviser to the Oakmark Funds, said today in an e-mailed
statement. Existing shareholders and participants in retirement
plans will still be able to add money to their accounts.  Herro, who in 2010 was named international stock-fund
manager of the decade by  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , attracted $8.2
billion to his fund in the first eight months of 2013, according
to data from the Chicago-based research firm. The $24.5 billion
Oakmark International Fund beat 94 percent of peers  this year 
and 96 percent over the past five years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The fund had about $11 billion in assets
at the end of 2012, the data show.  Harris Associates manages $106 billion, including $64
billion in Oakmark Funds. Oakmark is known for its value-oriented style, which means its portfolio managers seek to buy
underpriced securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
