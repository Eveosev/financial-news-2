Timothy Massad, the  U.S. Treasury 
Department’s assistant secretary for financial stability, will
leave his position this year, according to a Treasury official.  Massad is among the candidates for chairman of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to another
person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity. CFTC
chairman  Gary Gensler  has been serving since 2009, and his term
expires at the end of the year.  Massad, 57, is the Treasury official in charge of the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, which provided bailouts to banks
and automakers during the financial crisis and is now being
wound down.  About $421 billion was disbursed through TARP, and the
Treasury has received $405 billion as of Sept. 27, according to
data on the department’s website.  Massad’s departure from Treasury was previously reported by
the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
