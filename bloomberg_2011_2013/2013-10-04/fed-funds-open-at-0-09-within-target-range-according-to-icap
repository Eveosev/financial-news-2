Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-bank lending  rate , opened at 0.09 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.05 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.04 percent to 0.25 percent and averaging 0.06 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-mailed statement.  The central bank has no permanent open-market operations,
which are the part of the Fed’s quantitative easing program
aimed at keeping long-term rates low, scheduled today.  The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  announced on Sept. 20
that it will test an overnight fixed-rate full-allotment reverse
repo facility as an additional tool to aid policy makers when
they eventually seek to raise interest rates and tighten
monetary policy. These temporary open market operations, which
will be open to all eligible reverse repo counterparties and
will use Treasury collateral, will take place between 11:15 a.m.
and 11:45 a.m.  New York  time. The Fed said the transactions,
which began on Sept. 23, could extend through Jan. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
