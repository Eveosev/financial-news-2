Schmid Group , a German engineering
company with operations on four continents, plans to build South
America’s biggest solar-panel factory for the Argentinian power
utility Energia Provincial Sociedad del Estado.  The facility, planned for the western city of  San Juan ,
will be able to produce 70 megawatts of panels a year,
Freudenstadt-based Schmid Group said today in a statement.  The plant will process silicon ingots into cells and panels
and may eventually produce polysilicon, the raw material for
ingots, according to the statement.  Tecnometal Equipamentos Ltda. owns the continent’s biggest
solar-panel factory in  Brazil ’s southeastern city of Campinas,
with annual capacity of 25 megawatts, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
