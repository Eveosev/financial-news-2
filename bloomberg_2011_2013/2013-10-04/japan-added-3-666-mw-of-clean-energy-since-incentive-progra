Japan  has added clean energy equal to
nearly four nuclear reactors since the beginning of July 2012 in
an incentive program to diversify its energy mix.  The country added 3,666 megawatts of capacity powered by
renewable sources through the 12 months ended in June, the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said in a  statement 
today. A nuclear reactor can typically generate about 1,000
megawatts of energy.  Solar accounts for most of the added clean energy.
Residential sources totaled 1,379 megawatts while 2,120
megawatts were from utility- and commercial-scale projects,
according to the statement.  Japan has approved 22,914 megawatts of clean energy
projects, including wind and biomass, in the year since the
incentive programâ€™s introduction, the ministry said.  The approvals exceed the entire installed base of 20,600
megawatts of clean energy Japan had before the start of the
incentives, which are known as feed-in tariffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
