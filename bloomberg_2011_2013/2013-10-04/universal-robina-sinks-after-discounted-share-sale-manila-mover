Universal Robina Corp. (URC)  tumbled the
most in more than three months after parent  JG Summit Holdings
Inc. (JGS)  sold shares of the Philippine food and beverage company at
a discount.  The shares sank 4.8 percent to 117.10 pesos at the trading
break in  Manila , poised for the steepest loss since June 13. JG
Summit rose 3.2 percent to 42.10 pesos, bound for the highest
close since July 30.  JG Summit raised about 12 billion pesos ($278 million) from
the sale of 105 million Universal Robina shares at 115 pesos
each, according to a stock exchange filing today. That’s a 6.5
percent discount to yesterday’s closing price. The sale cut JG
Summit’s stake in Universal to 55.7 percent.  “This decline is an opportunity to buy,” said COL
Financial Group analyst Jed Frederick Pilarca, who has a buy
recommendation on Universal Robina and a target price of 140
pesos. “The market simply reacted to the discounted sale.
Nothing has changed on Universal Robina’s fundamentals.”  Proceeds from the sale may help fund JG Summit’s purchase
of a 27 percent stake in  Manila Electric Co. (MER)  for 72 billion
pesos, Pilarca said. The holding company may also have to borrow
to complete the fundraising, he said.  JG Summit’s dividends from units and investments will rise
38 percent to 11 billion pesos after buying the stake in Manila
Electric, the nation’s largest power utility, from  San Miguel
Corp. (SMC) , JG Summit President Lance Gokongwei said on Oct. 1.  JG Summit is also interested in buying stakes in other
power projects, betting that growth in the nation’s $250 billion
economy will boost power demand, Gokongwei said.  Universal Robina has six buy, two hold and two sell ratings
in a Bloomberg  survey  of analysts, with an average 12-month
price target of 139.03 pesos.  To contact the reporters on this story:
