Canadian farmers may harvest the most
wheat ever and produce the largest canola crop on record,
according to a government survey.  All-wheat production will probably expand to 33.0 million
metric tons, up from July’s  forecast  of 30.6 million tons,
Statistics  Canada  said today from Ottawa. Wheat production is
forecast to rise 22.0 percent from 27.1 million tons in 2012 and
exceed the record harvest of 32.1 million tons in 1990. The
average production estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg
News  was 32.7 million tons.  The canola harvest in Canada, the world’s largest grower,
may climb 15.9 percent to 16.0 million tons, up from July’s
forecast of 14.7 million tons and surpassing the record output
of 14.6 million tons in 2011, according to the report. Analysts
in a Bloomberg survey forecast 16.4 million tons.  Statistics Canada said it interviewed about 10,500 farmers
from Sept. 3 to Sept. 10. The estimate excludes production in
British Columbia and Canada’s Atlantic provinces, which account
for 2 to 4 percent of the national total, the agency said.  There are record yields being reported for crops in many
areas and the market will not be surprised if canola production
exceeds 16 million tons, Chuck Penner, the owner of LeftField
Commodity Research, said in a telephone interview from Winnipeg
before the report.  “It’s safe to say 2013 is going to be one to remember,”
he said.  Higher Yields  The average wheat yield is forecast to be a record 48.0
bushels per acre,  Statistics Canada  said today, up from 42.6
bushels per acre in 2012.  While planting in many parts of Western Canada was delayed
this spring by excess moisture and below-normal temperatures,
farmers managed to sow most of their crop by mid-June, according
to reports from  Alberta , Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the largest
grower of spring wheat. Crops progressed from good growing
conditions and output is expected to be significantly higher
than last year due to higher yields, Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada said in a Sept. 18  report .  Spring-wheat yields in parts of the Prairies are as high as
80 bushels per acre, FarmLink Marketing Solutions said in a
Sept. 27  report . Average to above average yields are being
reported in  Saskatchewan  and output in  Alberta  is “exceptional
with the quantities being the highest ever reported for
virtually all crops in all regions,” according to provincial
reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
