Taipei prosecutors questioned
President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Jiang Yi-huah over an
investigation into leaks of allegedly secret information by the
prosecutor-general.  Ma and Jiang were questioned last night as witnesses in the
probe, in which Prosecutor-general Huang Shyh-ming is suspected
of leaking secret information, Huang Mou-hsin, spokesman for the
Taipei District Prosecutors Office, said by phone today. Huang
Shyh-ming was also questioned.  The investigation further complicates Ma’s bid to get past
a series of scandals -- including the death of a military
conscript and plagiarism claims -- that resulted in the
resignations of 10 cabinet-level officials this year. Ma, whose
approval rating is lower than 10 percent, incurred criticism for
allegedly circumventing due process in his attempt to oust
 Taiwan ’s legislative speaker.  An appeals court on Sept. 30 upheld a freeze on the ruling
party’s bid to expel parliament speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who Ma
said was unfit to lead the legislature over alleged  influence
peddling . Wang denied any wrongdoing.  Taiwan’s  High Court  ruled the Kuomintang can’t expel Wang
until a determination is made on whether he tried to stop the
prosecution of an opposition lawmaker, as the party claims. The
Kuomintang said he tarnished its reputation.  Ma’s office replied in an e-mail it doesn’t comment on
investigations as probes aren’t public. Jiang’s and Huang Shyh-ming’s offices didn’t return calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
