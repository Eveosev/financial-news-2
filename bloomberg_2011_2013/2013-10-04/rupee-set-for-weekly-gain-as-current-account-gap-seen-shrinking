India ’s rupee headed for a weekly
gain after better-than-forecast current-account data boosted
optimism that the annual gap will narrow from a record.  The  shortfall  in the broadest measure of trade was $21.8
billion in April through June, compared with the median
prediction in a Bloomberg survey for a $23 billion deficit. The
gap will narrow to about $59 billion in the year through March
2014 from an unprecedented $87.8 billion the prior period,
Morgan Stanley predicts. The dollar has depreciated as a partial
U.S. government shutdown enters its fourth day amid wrangling
over the budget and increasing the nation’s debt limit.  “Expectations of improvement in the current account and
funding are materially important for the rupee,” analysts at
Morgan Stanley, including Hong Kong-based Geoffrey Kendrick,
wrote in a research report yesterday. “We are tactically
constructive on the rupee.”  The rupee advanced 1.8 percent this week to 61.4050 per
dollar as of 9:57 a.m. in Mumbai, the best performance among
emerging-market Asian currencies, according to prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg. It rose 0.4 percent today. The
Bloomberg  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against 10
major counterparts, fell 0.6 percent since Sept. 27.  The U.S. political impasse may compel the  Federal Reserve 
to prolong its stimulus, according to BNP Paribas SA. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  unexpectedly decided on Sept. 18 to
keep buying $85 billion of bonds each month.  The rupee’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
52 basis points this week, or 0.52 percentage point, to 15.14
percent.  One-month onshore rupee forwards climbed 0.6 percent today
to 61.92 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore
non-deliverable contracts jumped 0.8 percent to 61.89. Forwards
are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date.
Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
