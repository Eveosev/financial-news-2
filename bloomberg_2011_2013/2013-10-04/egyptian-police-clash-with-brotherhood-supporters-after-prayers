Security forces and supporters of
ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi clashed on the streets
of Cairo and other cities yesterday, leaving several people dead
and dozens injured.  Thousands of pro-Mursi demonstrators poured into the
streets of the capital after Friday prayers, live television
footage showed. Security forces fired tear gas in Qasr Al-Eini
Street, off  Tahrir Square , the state-run news agency MENA said,
and there were reports of gunfire. At least four people were
killed, the state-run Ahram Gate website said.  The Brotherhood is facing its toughest crackdown in decades
after Mursi, who was fielded for office by the group, was pushed
from power by the military on July 3 after days of mass
protests. The army-backed government sent police to clear
Islamist protest camps in August, leaving hundreds dead. Since
then Brotherhood leaders have been targeted by a wave of
arrests.  In eastern Cairo, security vehicles blockaded streets
leading to the Defense Ministry headquarters to prevent Mursi
supporters storming the building, Ahram online reported.
Demonstrations took place in other governorates including
Sharqiya and Suez, calling for the removal of army chief General
Abdelfatah al-Seesi.  The pro-Mursi  National Alliance  in Support of Legitimacy
has called for protests on Oct. 5 and 6 to mark the 40th
anniversary of the 1973 war with  Israel .  To contact the reporter on this story:
