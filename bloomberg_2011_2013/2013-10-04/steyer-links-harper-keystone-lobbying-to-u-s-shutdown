Billionaire investor Tom Steyer, an
opponent of the Keystone XL pipeline and donor to U.S. President
 Barack Obama , published a letter today that called on Canadian
Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  to provide more details of his
government’s lobbying on behalf of the project.  In the letter to Harper, Steyer asked whether Harper’s
government had any role in persuading Republicans to include
approval of the pipeline on the list of demands to Obama in
budget negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
