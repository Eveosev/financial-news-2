The premium that refined copper
buyers are expected to pay in  Europe  increased in the past month
on more orders, according to four people who trade the metal.  The premium is about $114 a metric ton in Rotterdam, based
on the median of midpoints from ranges given by the people, who
asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak to the media. That compares with $105 last month and $110
in August. The people cited more orders while demand is steady.  The premium ranged from $100 to $140 a ton, compared with
$100 to $120 a ton last month. The premium is added to the price
of cathode, a form of refined metal, for immediate delivery on
the London Metal Exchange. It includes insurance and costs to
ship to Rotterdam.  One person cited the range of $105 to $110 a ton, another
put it at $100 to $110 and a third at $115 to $125. A fourth
trader quoted $130 to $140 a ton. Copper for immediate delivery
on the LME settled at $7,154 a ton on the LME yesterday. The
metal gained 3 percent last month. Scrap supply is restricted
even as higher prices encouraged more supplies, the people said.  Aurubis AG (NDA) , Europe’s largest refined copper producer,
raised the 2014 premium by 22 percent to $105 a ton, it said
last week. Some suppliers of copper started to ask for higher
premiums for the metal after that announcement, one person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
