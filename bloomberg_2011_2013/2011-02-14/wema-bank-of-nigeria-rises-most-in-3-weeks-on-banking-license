  Wema Bank Plc , a Nigerian lender
that failed an audit test in 2009, rose the most in three weeks
after the central bank said it had exceeded the capital
requirement for a regional banking license.  The stock gained 7 kobo, or 4.8 percent, to 1.52 naira, by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, Nigeriaâ€™s commercial capital, its
highest since Feb.4.  Wema Bank exceeded the capital requirement for the license
for which it has applied,  Central Bank of Nigeria  said in a
statement posted on its website, dated Feb. 11.  The central bank in September asked lenders to choose
whether to operate as regional, national or international
lenders with minimum  capital requirements  ranging from 15
billion naira ($98 million) for regional banks to 100 billion
naira for international lenders.  Wema has risen 18 percent this year, compared with a 7.4
percent increase in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index
over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
