Germany’s revamp of rules to block
stealth takeovers such as Porsche SE tried in 2008 by buying
shares in  Volkswagen AG  entails only moderate sanctions,
weakening its impact, the  Financial Times Deutschland  said.  The legal amendment that was approved by parliament on Feb.
11 envisages fines for infringements of up to 1 million euros
($1.4 million), too little to act as a deterrent, the newspaper
today cites Free Democrat lawmaker  Frank Schaeffler  as saying.  Schaeffler and other lawmakers from Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s coalition seek another amendment that boosts fines for
infringements, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
