The  University of Kansas  moved past
 Ohio State University  for the top spot in college basketball’s  Associated Press  rankings after the Buckeyes lost their first
game of the season last weekend.  The Jayhawks (24-1) received 22 of the 65 first-place votes
in the media poll, passing Ohio State, which was second with 14
votes. It is the Jayhawks’ first No. 1 ranking since last
season, when they held the spot for six of the final seven
weeks.    Kansas  leads the nation in shooting percentage and is
averaging 83.9 points a game, sixth best among all 346
Division I teams. The Jayhawks are led by brothers Marcus and
Markieff Morris, junior forwards who are first and second on
the team in both scoring and rebounding.  The Buckeyes (24-1), who held the top spot for the previous
four weeks, lost on the road to the  University of Wisconsin  (19-
5) on Feb. 12, snapping the nation’s longest unbeaten streak.  Wisconsin , which also beat Ohio State in football on Oct. 16
when the Buckeyes were No. 1, became just the eighth school
to beat the top-ranked team in both sports in a single
season. With the win, the Badgers jumped three spots to No. 10.  The  University of Texas  (22-3), the only team to beat
Kansas this year, remains at No. 3. Pittsburgh (23-2) and Duke
(23-2) round out the top five.  Kansas plays Kansas State (16-9) tonight on the road. The
Jayhawks have won seven straight games against the Wildcats and
26 of 27 in  Manhattan , Kansas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
