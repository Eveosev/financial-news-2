  Barclays Capital ’s head of Islamic
finance left the company last month, a person familiar with the
matter said.  Harris Irfan, based in Dubai, joined the company in July
2009 and headed Islamic finance operations for Barclays Capital
and Barclays Wealth, part of  Barclays Plc . The British bank’s
spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg
News today.  Reuters  reported earlier today Irfan left the company after
the bank decided to focus less on Shariah-compliant product
offerings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
