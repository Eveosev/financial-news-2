  GDF Suez ’s liquefied-natural-gas
terminal near  Boston  is scheduled to receive a cargo Feb. 19,
according to vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Matthew, the tanker carrying the cargo, can move as much as
126,540 cubic meters of LNG, or about 2.72 billion cubic feet of
natural gas, equivalent to 4.4 percent of estimated daily U.S.
gas production.  Another vessel, Norman Lady, is also carrying a cargo of
LNG to Boston. The ship, which can move as much as 86,234 cubic
meters of the fuel, is scheduled to arrive Feb. 23.  GDF Suez operates the Everett terminal, which can send
about 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day into the regional
pipeline network, according to  the company.  GDF’s Neptune
offshore LNG terminal, which consists of a buoy system, is also
near Boston.  The following table shows tankers scheduled to arrive in  North America  this month, according to the tracking data. Vessel
capacity is converted to billion cubic feet of natural gas.  LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back to a gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
