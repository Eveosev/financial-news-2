Franz Haniel & Cie GmbH, the  investment company  that controls  Metro AG  with other
shareholders, is in “advanced talks” to sell real estate used
by the retailer in  Germany , spokesman Dietmar Bochert said.  Cerberus Capital Management LP asked Germany’s antitrust
authority to authorize a real estate acquisition from three
Metro shareholders, according to the  Bundeskartellamt  website.  Bochert declined to comment on a report by  Handelsblatt 
that Haniel will sell 45 buildings to Cerberus. The properties
are worth 600 million euros ($813 million) to 1 billion euros,
the newspaper said. Haniel co-owns the real estate with Metro
shareholders Otto Beisheim and the Schmidt-Ruthenbeck family.  The disposal of the Metro real estate is needed to achieve
Haniel’s goal of obtaining an investment-grade rating, Chief
Executive Officer Juergen Kluge said in April 2010.  Metro, based in Dusseldorf, operates in more than 30
countries and is the world’s third-largest retailer. Its outlets
include supermarkets, electronics stores and department stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
