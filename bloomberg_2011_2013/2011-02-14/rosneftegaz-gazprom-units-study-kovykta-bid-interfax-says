Affiliates of state holding unit
Rosneftegaz and OAO Gazprom,  Russia â€™s natural gas exporter, are
considering bids in the bankruptcy auction for Rusia Petroleum,
owner of the Kovykta gas field, Interfax reported, citing
unidentified people.  Gazprom representatives sought information on participation
in the sale, which has been postponed to March 1 from Feb. 15,
Interfax said.  The auction was delayed after an affiliate of Rosneftegaz,
the state unit that controls OAO Rosneft and owns part of
Gazprom, failed to register in time for the auction, Interfax
said.  Rusia Petroleum filed for bankruptcy after its main
shareholder TNK-BP on May 14 demanded repayment for loans to
develop the Kovykta field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
