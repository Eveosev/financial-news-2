Slovenia’s Pensioners Party would
take second place if elections were held tomorrow, just behind
the biggest opposition group, overtaking the ruling Social
Democrats of Prime Minister Borut Pahor for the first time, a
survey showed.  The pensioners party, also known as DeSus, would gain 13
percent of the vote, trailing the  Slovenian Democratic Party ,
led by former Premier Janez Jansa, by more than 10 percentage
points, according to a Delo Stik survey conducted between Feb. 7
and Feb. 10. The Delo Stik poll, published in the  Delo
newspaper , surveyed 705 people. No margin of error was
specified.  Premier’s Pahor party would get a 10.6 percent support, the
survey suggested.  Slovenia, an euro region member since 2007, faces regular
election in just a bit less than two year’s time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
