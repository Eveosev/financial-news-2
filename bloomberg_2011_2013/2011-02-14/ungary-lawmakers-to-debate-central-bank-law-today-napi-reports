Hungarian lawmakers will start
discussing a proposal today that would hand the power to appoint
outside members of the rate-setting Monetary Council to a ruling
party-dominated parliamentary committee,  Napi Gazdasag  reported,
citing the bill.  Future rate-setters would no longer have to attend
confirmation hearings before parliamentary committees, the
business newspaper said, citing the bill. Lawmakers must approve
the proposal by next week for it to take effect before the
mandates of the four outside members of the Monetary Council
expire on March 1, Napi said.  Currently the prime minister and the central bank president
each can nominate two of the four outside members of the seven-
member Monetary Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
