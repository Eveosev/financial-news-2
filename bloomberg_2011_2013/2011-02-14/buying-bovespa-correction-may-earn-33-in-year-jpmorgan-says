The Bovespa’s 9.9 percent drop from
a November high is likely a “correction” and not a “crash”
as Brazilian earnings are growing and flows from emerging to
developed markets have eased, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.    Brazil ’s benchmark stock index returned an average of 33
percent in a year after declines of 10 percent, said Ben Laidler, head of Latin American strategy at JPMorgan in New
York. Considering 16 slides of at least 10 percent over the past
17 years, the Bovespa still may decline another 9 percent before
rebounding, Laidler wrote in a note to clients today.  Financial and consumer-discretionary shares are “already
oversold,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
