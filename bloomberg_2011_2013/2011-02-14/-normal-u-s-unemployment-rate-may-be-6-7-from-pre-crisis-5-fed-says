The new “normal”  unemployment rate 
may now be 6.7 percent, rising as much as 1.7 percentage points
from 5 percent before the recession began, according to
researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.  High rates of long-term joblessness, extended  unemployment
benefits  and a mismatch of skills between workers and available
jobs may be impeding a return to the previous level, said  John Williams , the bank’s research director, and research associate
Justin Weidner in a paper released today.  The U.S. jobless rate was 9 percent as of January, marking
21 straight months in which it has remained at or above 9
percent. Fed officials noted after their most recent meeting in
January that the economy isn’t expanding enough to bring a
“significant improvement” to labor markets.  “An examination of alternative measures of labor market
conditions suggests that the ‘normal’ unemployment rate may have
risen as much as 1.7 percentage points to about 6.7 percent,”
Williams and Weidner said. “Much of this increase is likely to
prove temporary” and “even with such an increase, sizeable
labor market slack is expected to persist for years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
