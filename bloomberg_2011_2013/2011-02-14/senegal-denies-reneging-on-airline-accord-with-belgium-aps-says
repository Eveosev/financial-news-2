Senegalese Air Transport Minister
Karim Wade said the country hasn’t reneged on an accord with  Belgium  over access to its principal airport because the
agreement was never signed, the Agence de Presse Senegalaise
reported.  Belgium recalled its ambassador last month after the West
African nation prevented Brussels Airlines NV from landing at
the airport in the capital, Dakar, en route to Banjul, the
capital of Gambia, citing “national interests,” according to
the Dakar-based newswire.  Local carriers include Senegal Airlines, a 34 percent
state-owned company founded by Wade, son of President Abdoulaye Wade. On Jan. 25, Senegal Airlines began flights to West African
capitals, including Banjul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
