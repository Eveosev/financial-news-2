Canadian Industry Minister Tony
Clement says he has no updated information about a possible
review of the proposed $3.2 billion purchase of  TMX Group Inc .
by  London Stock Exchange Group Plc .  Clement was speaking to reporters in Ottawa today. Last
week he said the merger may be subject to a review under federal
foreign-investment legislation.  He also told reporters today that he may respond this week
to a court ruling on whether Globalive Communications Corp. can
operate in the country. Clement said his officials have “made
progress” on the Globalive issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
