Aircraft and helicopter programs of  Boeing Co . receive funding boosts in Pentagon’s $671 billion
request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1., the first year of
what the Defense Department is calling ‘modest’’ growth through
2016.  The second-largest defense contractor’s portfolio,
 including F/A-18E/F Super Hornets   and AH-64D Apache  helicopters,
benefits across the board in the fiscal 2012 spending plan
submitted to Congress today that requests $553 billion for the
basic budget and $117.8 billion for the wars in Iraq and  Afghanistan , the  lowest level  of war spending since 2006.  “This budget represents a reasonable, responsible and
sustainable level of funding, the minimum level of defense
spending that is necessary, given the security challenges we are
facing,” Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  said in a statement
today.  Gates since 2009 has warned that growth in defense spending
following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, would taper off. He has
 canceled , terminated or truncated programs including Lockheed
Martin Corp.’s F-22 jet, Boeing’s C-17 transport planes, and the
manned vehicle part of the Army’s Future Combat Systems. This
year, among other cuts, he has called for canceling  General
Dynamics Corp .’s $15 billion Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle
being designed for the Marine Corps.  Previewing the 2012 Pentagon budget at a Jan. 6 news
 conference  Gates said “we must come to realize that not every
defense program is necessary, not every defense dollar is sacred
and well-spent and that more of nearly everything is simply not
sustainable.”  Fastest Growth  U.S. defense spending has grown the fastest since the last
time the federal budget was balanced in 2001, compared with
increases in Social Security and Medicare spending.  The three items together constitute the largest U.S.
spending programs, according to nonpartisan  Center  for Strategic
and Budgetary Assessments in  Washington .  The Pentagon for the fifth consecutive year opposes funding
General Electric Co.’s alternative engine for the F-35 jet.  Gates last year said he’d recommend the president veto the
fiscal 2011 bill if it contained engine money. Congress
authorizes continued funding in the pending 2012 stopgap
legislation.  “The Department continues to assess the best way to
proceed with this particular issue.”  $13 Billion Reduction  The fiscal 2012 request represents a $13 billion reduction
from the $569 billion the Pentagon last year said it would
request in fiscal 2012.  The cut is the first installment of $78 billion in deficit
reduction cuts over a $2.91 trillion defense plan through 2016,
or about a 2.67 percent cuts.  Succeeding requests are being reduced annually by $11
billion each in 2013 and 2014, $18 billion in 2015 and $24
billion in 2016, according to a Pentagon budget summary released
today.  The planned fiscal 2013-2016 annual base figures are $571
billion, $586 billion, $598 billion and $611 billion
respectively.  Those numbers represent an average annual growth adjusted
for inflation of 1 percent when assessed against the fiscal 2011
appropriations, still pending in Congress, of about $526
billion.  Using this benchmark the increase between this year and
2012 is 3.6 percent real growth, according to the Pentagon.  Still, compared with the $548 billion 2011 request the
fiscal 2012 proposal represents a decline of 0.7 percent,
according to the figures. The average inflation adjusted
“increase” through 2016 is 0.2 percent.  Aircraft, Space Dollars  Boeing, based in  Chicago , also fares well in the $54
billion of manned and unmanned procurement and research dollars
requested -- about 27 percent of the entire procurement and
research request of $203.8 billion.  Overall, the aircraft account also includes $10 billion for
helicopters and rotorcraft made by Boeing,  United Technologies
Corp ’s Sikorsky Aircraft unit and Textron Inc.  Stratford, Connecticut-based Sikorsky benefits from a $1.6
billion request for 75 additional  UH-60 Black Hawk  choppers.  Also included is $4.8 billion for unmanned drones made by
privately held, San Diego-based General Atomics and Los Angeles-
based  Northrop Grumman Corp . The  Air Force  and Army are
requesting $2.5 billion for General Atomics  Reaper  and  Grey 
Eagle drones.  The Air Force is requesting $1.6 billion in procurement and
development of RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drones. The Air
Force also decided to truncate the advanced  Block 40  Global Hawk
at 11 aircraft from 22, saving $428 million through 2016.  Presidential Helicopter  Funding is included to continue development of a new
presidential helicopter to replace the canceled VH-71.  The budget asks $2.66 billion for 28 Boeing F/A-18E/F jets,
$1.1 billion for 12 EA-18G electronic warfare versions, $1.4
billion to buy or upgrade 47 CH-47 Chinook transport
helicopters, and $816 million to upgrade 19 Boeing Co. AH-64
Apache Helicopters.  Boeing also splits the revenue with  Textron Inc . on the
V-22 tilt-rotor Osprey. The Pentagon is requesting $2.97 billion
for 36 additional aircraft.  The company also benefits from $1.16 billion requested for
continued development and sustainment of the U.S. ground-based
missile defense system in Alaska and  California . The Pentagon is
requesting $10.6 billion overall on missile defense.  Space Venture  In space, Boeing is partner on the Denver, Colorado-based
 United Launch Alliance  joint venture with Lockheed Martin that
boosts military satellites into space. The Pentagon is
requesting $1.7 billion in launch services in fiscal 2012 and
almost $8 billion between 2013 and 2016.  The aircraft account also includes $9.7 billion in
procurement and development dollars for 32 Lockheed Martin’s
F-35 jets, 13 fewer than planned last year before Gates in
January announced additional delays.  It includes $1.2 billion for purchase of 12 additional
Lockheed Martin C-130J transports and $598 million for eight
more  C-27J Army transports  produced by New York City-based L-3
Communications Holdings, Inc.  The aircraft account also includes $199 million for early
research into a new long-range bomber, the first installment of
a $3.7 billion Air Force Long-Range Strike Family.  Vessel Dollars  The budget includes $24.6 billion to buy 11 ships,
including two  Virginia-class submarines , four  Littoral Combat
Ships  and one  DDG-51 destroyer .  Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics will get $4.9 billion
to jointly build the additional nuclear-powered attack submarine
at their shipyards in  Newport News ,  Virginia  and Groton,  Connecticut .  Northrop Grumman, the nation’s only builder of aircraft
carriers, will get $908 million in advance funding for the
 Gerald Ford-class carrier , and $408 million for a carrier
refueling and overhaul.  The budget provides about $2.1 billion for the DDG-51
destroyer, built by Northrop Grumman in Pascagoula, Mississippi
and General Dynamics in Bath,  Maine .  Two teams-- led by Lockheed Martin and Austal USA--would
get $2.2 billion to build four additional Littoral Combat Ships
-- a surface combatant designed to operate close to shore.  Amphibious Ships  Northrop also would get $1.8 billion to build the last of
11  LPD-17 amphibious transport dock ship  and $2 billion in
additional funding for a  LHA amphibious assault ship  ordered
this year.  General Dynamics would get $425.9 million for a  Mobile
Landing Platform , built in  San Diego , used to by other ships to
transfer vehicles, personnel and equipment.  Mobile, Alabama-based Austal USA also would get $416
million to build two  Joint High Speed Vessels  -- shallow-draft
ships designed for rapid transport. One ship would be used by
the Navy and the other by the Army.  The budget proposes $16.1 billion for ground programs,
including $7.86 billion for support equipment, $5.22 billion for
combat vehicles, $2.28 billion for tactical wheeled vehicles and
$723 million for weapons.  General Dynamics would get $834 million for 100  Stryker 
vehicles and $191 million for 21 upgraded M1A2  Abrams  tanks. The
Stryker is an armored wheeled vehicle and the Abrams is the
Army’s main battle tank.  Heavy Vehicles    Oshkosh Corp . would receive $680 million for 1,598 Family
of Heavy Tactical Vehicles, or FHTVs, trailers and tracking
systems, and $448 million for 2,422  Family of Medium Tactical
Vehicles , or FMTVs.  The FHTV includes the  Palletized Load System , or PLS, a
16.5-ton truck that moves containers, and the  Heavy Expanded
Mobility Tactical Truck , or HEMTT, a 10-ton truck that refuels
helicopters, tows missiles and recovers vehicles. The FMTV
includes 2.5-ton and 5-ton trucks that are used to resupply
units with equipment and personnel.  The budget would increase spending on the Joint Light
Tactical Vehicle, or JLTV, to $243.9 million. The Army and
Marine Corps are developing the JLTV to replace the Humvee.  Three industry teams have won contracts to develop JLTV
prototypes, including BAE Systems Plc, General Tactical
Vehicles, a joint venture of General Dynamics and Humvee-maker
AM General Llc, and  Lockheed Martin Corp .  To contact the reporters on this story:  Tony Capaccio  in Washington at
