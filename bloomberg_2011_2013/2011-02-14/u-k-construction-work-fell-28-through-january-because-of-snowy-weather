The value of U.K. construction work
started in the three months to Jan. 31 fell 28 percent from a
year earlier as snowy weather hampered building work, according
to construction information provider  Glenigan .  The decrease reflected a decline in private housing project
starts, the Bournemouth, England-based information company said
in an e-mailed statement of its Glenigan Index. The index fell
24 percent in the three months through December.  “The country saw a downturn in private housing project
starts during the latter half 2010 which was only worsened by
the disruption caused by the cold conditions,” Glenigan said.
“There was a rebound in January, but not enough to rectify the
dramatic fall in new developments.”  The index tracks building projects starting on site each
month valued from 100,000 pounds ($160,000) to 100 million
pounds in the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
