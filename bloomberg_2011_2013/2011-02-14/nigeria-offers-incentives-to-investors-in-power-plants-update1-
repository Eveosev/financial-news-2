  Nigeria  plans to offer incentives to
investors interested in buying power companies that are being
offered for sale, including tax breaks for five years, duty
waivers and the ability to charge higher electricity tariffs.  The government would also ensure that any labor problems
are “resolved before handover” to buyers, the Bureau for
Public Enterprises said in an e-mailed statement today.  Investors have until Feb. 18 to express their interest in
the companies, Bolanle Onagoruwa, director general of the Abuja-
based agency that helps sell state-owned assets, said in the
statement.  The country,  Africa ’s most populous and top oil producer,
plans to sell six state-owned transmission and 11 thermal-
generation companies by July, Minister of State for Power, Nuhu Wya, said in November. Power cuts occur daily in Nigeria, where
demand for electricity is almost double the current supply of
more than 3,000 megawatts. The government wants to increase
output to 14,019 megawatts by 2013.  President Goodluck Jonathan announced plans in August to
end the monopoly of state-owned Power Holding Co. of Nigeria and
open the industry to investment. The bureau held road shows in
Dubai and  London  last month and in  New York  and Johannesburg
this month to meet potential investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
