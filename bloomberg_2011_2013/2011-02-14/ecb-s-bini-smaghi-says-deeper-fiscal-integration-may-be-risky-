European Central Bank Executive
Board Member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  said that greater budgetary and
fiscal integration in the euro area would not necessarily solve
the currency-bloc’s problems.  “While solving some of the problems of the current system,
the new regime could import new problems which might be
politically even more difficult to tackle,” Bini Smaghi said in
a speech at the Institute for Economic Research in Halle,  Germany  today. It may be “risky” for the euro region to move
to greater fiscal integration, he said.  European policymakers have debated moving toward greater
fiscal centralization in the currency zone as a means of
limiting excessive budget deficits similar to those that led
Greece and Ireland to seek aid from the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  last year.  “A federal budget is better capable of addressing
asymmetric shocks, but not symmetric shocks, and may not be the
most efficient approach in an area which catching-up countries
will continue to join,” Bini Smaghi said.  He also said that decentralization of budget policy
“enhances accountability and allows better supervision by
voters.” It would be “quite damaging if ‘Brussels’ were to be
blamed also for the poor state of public finances,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
