What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on higher demand for U.S. exports
after adverse weather reduced global production, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on speculation that Mexico will increase
imports of U.S. supplies after freezing weather last week
damaged crops, Gerlach said.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT after rains in the past month boosted crops in South
America, Gerlach said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
little changed, and soybean-meal futures may open down $1 to $2
per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
