Mobile-phone companies are
intensifying a campaign to impose charges on Internet content
providers such as  Google Inc ., which are pouring large
quantities of data traffic on to telecommunications networks,
the Financial Times reported.  Franco Bernabe, the chief executive officer of  Telecom
Italia SpA  and the chairman of the GSMA, mobile operators’
global representative body, told the newspaper there can be “no
free lunch” for the content providers.  Operators hope a meeting planned by the European Commission
next month, involving executives from telecommunications
companies and from Google, Facebook Inc. and  Apple Inc ., will
strengthen their efforts to charge for high-quality delivery of
content to customers, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
