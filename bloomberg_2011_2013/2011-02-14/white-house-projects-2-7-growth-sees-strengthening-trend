The Obama administration cut its
forecast for U.S. economic growth this year and raised its
unemployment outlook to an average of 9.3 percent, in an
assessment completed in November, adding that more recent
numbers show a trend toward strengthening.  Gross domestic product will increase 2.7 percent this year,
the White House said today, compared with the 3.6 percent growth
it predicted in July. Next year, the economy will expand 3.6
percent, compared with 4.2 percent in the previous forecast,
according to economic predictions that accompanied President  Barack Obama ’s 2012 budget proposal.  The outlook is less gloomy than those numbers suggest
because of stronger economic data in recent months and because
of December legislation to lower taxes and extend  unemployment
benefits , the White House said. As a result, the economy may
have a speedier return to its long-term potential, the budget
said.  “These factors have caused most private forecasters to
increase their near-term projections for real economic growth
substantially,” the White House said. “The administration
would probably make similar changes were it possible to reopen
the forecast.”  On Feb. 9, Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said
private economists and forecasters project annual economic
growth of 3 percent to 4 percent over the next two years.  An  unemployment rate  of 9.3 percent this year was 0.3
percentage point higher than the administration’s July forecast.
Today’s proposal projected that the jobless rate will fall to an
average of 8.6 percent next year.  Record Deficit  The administration’s new budget projects a record $1.6
trillion deficit in fiscal year 2011 and a $1.1 trillion deficit
the following year. The report includes proposals for a range of
spending cuts and tax changes aimed at trimming the shortfall
over the next decade.  “Now that the threat of a depression has passed, and
economic growth is beginning to take hold, taking further steps
toward reducing our long-term deficit has to be a priority,”
Obama said in a letter to Congress accompanying the budget.  “In the long run, we will not be able to compete with
countries like China if we keep borrowing more and more from
countries like China,” he said.  China  is the largest overseas
holder of  U.S. government debt , with holdings of $895.6 billion
as of November, according to the most recent available Treasury
Department data.  Inflation Forecast  In the budget report, the administration projected
inflation will hold below 2 percent in the next two years. The
budget predicts the consumer price index will increase 1.3
percent in 2011 and 1.8 percent in 2012, before settling into a
long-term range of about 2 percent.  Yields on Treasury debt are expected to rise. The budget
predicts a 3 percent interest rate on 10-year notes in 2011 and
a 3.6 percent rate in 2012, before settling at 5.3 percent by
2017.  The White House’s latest forecast calls for the economy to
grow 4.4 percent in 2013, 4.3 percent in 2014 and 3.8 percent in
2015, before settling into 2.5 percent growth by 2019. Over the
same time period, it calls for the jobless rate to drop to 7.5
percent in 2013 and 6.6 percent in 2014, falling each year until
2017, when unemployment is expected to be 5.3 percent.  The jobless rate unexpectedly fell in January to the lowest
level in 21 months, while payroll growth was depressed by winter
storms.  Joblessness Drops  Unemployment declined to 9 percent from December’s 9.4
percent, the Labor Department said Feb. 4 in  Washington .
Employers added 36,000 workers, short of the 146,000 median gain
projected by economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Secretary Geithner predicted last week that “the
unemployment rate’s going to come down gradually over the next
several years,” given current growth rates and private-sector
forecasts. He said last month’s drop in joblessness “probably
overstated” labor-market strength, while separate figures on
hiring “probably understated” current conditions.  The Commerce Department said on Jan. 28 that the  U.S.
economy  accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2010 as  consumer
spending  climbed by the most in more than four years and gross
domestic product grew at a 3.2 percent annual rate. For all of
2010, the world’s largest economy expanded 2.9 percent, the most
in five years, after shrinking 2.6 percent in 2009.  The cost of living in the U.S. climbed more than forecast
in December, led by higher fuel and food prices, while other
goods and services showed the smallest annual increase on
record. The  consumer-price index  increased 0.5 percent and the
so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and fuel
costs, rose 0.1 percent, according to Jan. 14 figures from the
Labor Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Rebecca Christie  in Washington at
