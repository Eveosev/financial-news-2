Jadeveon Clowney, the 18-year-old
defensive end ranked as the top high school recruit in the
country on most evaluation lists, will play college football at
the  University of South Carolina .  Clowney, the USA Today defensive player of the year and
top-ranked prospect by  ESPNU  and  Rivals.com , made the
announcement this morning on ESPN. The 6-foot-6, 247-pound
defensive end played at South Pointe High in  Rock Hill , South
Carolina, 68 miles (110 kilometers) from the university’s main
campus in Columbia.  “It’s close to home, and my momma can come to see me all
the time,” Clowney said.  Clowney entered South Pointe as a 6-foot-3, 200-pound
running back and switched to defense. He had 162 tackles, 29 1/2
sacks, 11 forced fumbles and five defensive touchdowns in his
senior season. According to Rivals, Clowney runs the 40-yard
dash in 4.6 seconds.  The Gamecocks and coach Steve Spurrier were 9-5 last season
and won the Southeastern Conference East Division.  South
Carolina  was defeated by Auburn in the conference title game and
lost to Florida State in the Chick-fil-A Bowl on Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
