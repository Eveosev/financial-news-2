Engro Corp., a Pakistani group that
makes fertilizer, dairy products and plastics, said full-year
profit rose 73 percent on higher sales.  Net income rose to 6.44 billion rupees ($75.6 million), or
20.72 rupees a share, in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, from 3.72
billion rupees or 12.24 rupees a share a year ago, the Karachi-
based company said in a statement to the stock exchange today.
Sales rose to 79.9 billion rupees from 58.2 billion.  The company’s fertilizer business contributed 83 percent to
Engro’s profits, Sarah Afridi, a research analyst at IGI Finex

in a report to clients on Feb. 11. The price of urea rose 16
percent in 2010 to 813 rupees for a 50 kilogram (110 pounds)
