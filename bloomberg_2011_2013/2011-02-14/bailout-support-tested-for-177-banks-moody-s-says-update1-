The subordinated debt ratings of 177
banks in 46 countries will be reviewed and the grades may be cut
as Moody’s Investors Service reassesses governments’ willingness
and ability to support lenders in difficulties.  Moody’s will begin its review in countries such as  Germany 
where governments have reformed their bank resolution regimes
and shown “a clear intent” to impose losses on creditors, the
New York-based ratings firm said today. As new legislation is
enacted in various nations, Moody’s said it will analyze the
probable impact and review ratings likely to be affected.  “Regulators have expressed an intent to reach more deeply
into the  capital structure  to recover in future bailouts the
cost to taxpayers,” Moody’s said. As well as imposing losses on
equity, holders of “preferred stock, other forms of hybrid
capital and now, in many countries, subordinated debt,” have
been hurt, Moody’s said.  In  Denmark , Amagerbanken A/S, the country’s fifth-largest
traded lender, failed last week, wiping out equity and
subordinated debt and imposing losses of about 41 percent on
holders of senior debt. In Ireland, where bailing out the banks
has plunged the country into crisis, the discussion has moved
from shielding senior bondholders against loss to “burden
sharing” with senior creditors as a general election
approaches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
