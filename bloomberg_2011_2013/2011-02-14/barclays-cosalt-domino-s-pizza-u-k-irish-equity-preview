U.K. stocks fell for a second day as
a report showed that inflation accelerated to a two-year high in
January.    Weir Group Plc  slid 1.9 percent after Citigroup Inc.
downgraded the shares.  Barclays Plc  climbed 5.8 percent after
posting results that beat analysts’ estimates.  Premier Foods Plc 
surged 17 percent after the maker of Hovis bread and Ambrosia
Devon Custard said profit advanced.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  declined 0.4 percent to
6,037.08 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. Even so, the gauge
has rallied 2.3 percent so far this year. The  FTSE All-Share
Index  also decreased 0.4 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index added 0.2 percent.  U.K. inflation accelerated to 4 percent in January, the
fastest pace since November 2008 and double the central bank’s
target, matching the median forecast of 30 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. That forced  Bank of England  Governor
Mervyn King to write to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to explain the bank’s interest-rate policy. King
presents his quarterly economic forecasts in London tomorrow.  “The concern to our minds is that the risk from commodity
price increases combined with tax-push inflation has masked the
underlying inflationary tendencies within the U.K. economy,”
Gerard Lane, an equity strategist at London-based Shore Capital
Group Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed note. “The pressure on rates
to move higher could well be too much to bear for the Bank of
England despite fiscal austerity.”  Weir, Xstrata Fall  Weir dropped 1.9 percent to 1,730 pence. Citigroup
downgraded the world’s biggest maker of pumps for the mining
industry to “hold” from “buy,” saying “the share price is
now more in line with its peers and as such we see more limited
near-term upside.”    Xstrata Plc  dropped 2.4 percent to 1,470 pence. The mining
company halted output at its Ulan mine in New South Wales,
Australia, after heavy rain caused flooding and delayed
deliveries to some customers.  Barclays climbed 5.8 percent to 328.8 pence. Britain’s
third-largest bank said 2010 net income fell to 3.56 billion
pounds ($5.74 billion), beating the average analyst estimate of
3.2 billion pounds, as writedowns shrank and investment-banking
profit almost doubled.  Premier Foods surged 17 percent to 25.8 pence, its highest
price since May last year. The company said full-year trading
profit rose 0.6 percent compared with a year earlier, to 311
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
