Naguib Sawiris, chairman of  Orascom
Telecom Holding SAE , said he is concerned about capital outflows
from  Egypt  following the unrest that led to the resignation of
President  Hosni Mubarak .  “I am concerned about the outflow of capital, yes you are
right, but it will be temporary until people see a real
democratic regime and see a return of normality,” Sawiris said
in a phone interview on Bloomberg Television.  Egypt’s benchmark stock index tumbled 16 percent in the
week before trading was suspended on Jan. 30. The stock market
delayed reopening until Feb. 16 to give companies a chance to
disclose information on the impact of the protests on their
operations, the Cairo-based exchange said Feb. 12. Tomorrow is a
public holiday.  Sawiris, who was a member of an informal committee that
negotiated with Vice President  Omar Suleiman  about a gradual
transfer of power by Mubarak before the leader resigned, said he
has pulled back from his recent involvement in the political
transition.  “I consider my mission accomplished,” he said. “I think
I contributed to as much as I could in these difficult times and
now I want to go back to my work and to my business and to my
family.”  The global depositary shares of Orascom Telecom in London
rallied 5.9 percent to $3.49 at 8:38 a.m. in  London , valuing the
company at $3.67 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
