President Barack Obama today
proposed a $61.85 billion budget for discretionary spending on
U.S. military veterans in fiscal year 2012, including $6 billion
to treat troops who return from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars
with post-traumatic stress disorders and brain injuries.  The total budget request for the Department of  Veterans
Affairs , the second-largest federal agency with about 300,000
employees, is $124.3 billion, including $65.5 billion projected
for mandatory entitlements, such as disability compensation. The
$124.3 billion figure does not reflect about $3 billion in
anticipated revenue from health-insurance reimbursements.  The numbers used by the White House in its budget documents
reflect budget outlays for the mandatory entitlements. The
Department of Veterans Affairs said Monday afternoon that it had
budget authority of $70 billion for the mandatory portion of its
budget, bringing the total VA budget for 2012 to $132 billion.  Congress will take up the request for $61.85 billion in
discretionary VA spending amid efforts to reduce budget
deficits. The fiscal 2012 proposal, for the year beginning Oct.
1, represents a 10.6 percent increase over the enacted fiscal
year 2010 budget for the VA. The medical component of VA
discretionary funding for 2011 was approved as part of the 2010
budget. Other elements continue to be funded at 2010 level under
the current continuing resolution.  It is the second largest agency budget increase after the  Department of Energy , which has a proposed 12 percent increase
over 2010.  Medical Spending  Obama’s budget also includes $52.3 billion for medical care
in fiscal year 2013, about $1.5 billion more than the 2012
request of $50.8 billion. Congress requested the medical-care
budget a year in advance because medical care makes up more than
80 percent of the VA’s discretionary budget. Congress approves
the medical-care money for two consecutive years.  Congress is funding the federal government for the current
fiscal year through a stopgap measure, known as a continuing
resolution, which expires March 4. The continuing resolution
funds the government at fiscal year 2010 levels because Congress
did not approve a 2011 budget for federal agencies. The VA has
available $48.2 billion for fiscal year 2011 approved as part of
the previous year’s budget.  Obama’s 2012 budget proposal includes $939 million to
expand the VA’s services for homeless veterans and those at risk
of becoming homeless. A recent analysis published by the VA and
Department of Housing and Urban Development concluded that new
veterans, likely of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, are “at
particularly high risk of becoming homeless.”  Homeless Veterans  About 76,000 veterans were homeless on a given night in
2009, while about 136,000 Veterans spent at least one night in a
shelter that year, according to the analysis published Feb. 10.  Veterans represent about 12 percent of all homeless persons
counted nationwide during the period of the 2009 study. Of
those, more than 11,300 veterans 18 to 30 years old, an age
group that served during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, used a
shelter, according to the report.  Obama is also budgeting $953 million for contingencies in
2012 to address potential costs to the VA as a result of changes
in economic conditions.  Obama is proposing $183 million for a paperless claims
processing system. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, a former Army
chief of staff, had planned to implement a paperless claims
processing system by 2012 to reduce the disability claims
processing time to 125 days.  More Claims  More than a million benefits claims are awaiting VA
approval, according to numbers cited by the  American Legion , a
veterans’ service organization. The frequency of claims filings
has increased because of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans
returning to the U.S. and the recent addition to the claims
process of several medical conditions related to Vietnam-era
exposure to toxic chemicals such as  Agent Orange .  Overall, Obama is proposing $3.1 billion for the VA’s
information-technology overhaul, about a $150 million decrease
from the 2010 budget.  The VA also is working to develop electronic health-care
records, paperless claims systems and integration of medical and
service records with the  Department of Defense .  The VA and the Pentagon are collaborating on the Virtual
Lifetime Electronic Record program to allow the digital sharing
of health and benefits data of military members and veterans.  CACI International Inc . said in October it won a $91 million
contract to work on that program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
