Hygeia Diagnostic & Therapeutic SA,
a Greek hospital operator, said its board approved the sale of a
50 percent stake in Genesis Holdings SA, which owns Safak
Group’s four hospitals in  Turkey , for $22 million.  Hygeia still owns Safak and the sale to the Ozturk family
gives it full control of Genesis and its four hospitals in
Turkey.  Hygeia said the sale will strengthen the position of
Safak’s remaining hospitals in Cyprus, Greece and Albania, and
allow it to seek investments in southeast  Europe ,  Areti Souvatzoglou, Hygeia’s chief executive officer, said in an
 Athens bourse  filing today.  The sale is expected to lower consolidated net debt by 15
million euros ($20 million), according to the filing.  The Ozturk family will acquire the 50 percent it doesn’t
already own pending approval from Turkey’s Competition Board.  Hygeia’s operating profit will be “positively” affected
as Hygeia incurred 7 million euros of losses from the investment
in 2010 and was forecasting a higher loss this year.  Athens-based Hygeia said last October it would maintain 100
percent control of three hospitals in the Safak Group with full
control of the fourth hospital going to the Ozturk family, which
owned the other 50 percent stake in Genesis.  The agreement wasn’t implemented due to “legal”,
“regulatory” and other problems, the filing said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
