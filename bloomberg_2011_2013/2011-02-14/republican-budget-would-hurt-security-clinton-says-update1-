Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said she has “deep concerns” about proposed
cuts by House Republicans in the U.S. State Department budget.  “The scope of these proposed House cuts is massive,”
Clinton told reporters after meeting at the Capitol today with
House Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican. “Cuts of that
level will be detrimental to America’s national security.”  A plan House Republicans released Feb. 11 would reduce
spending this year by $61 billion between March 4 and Sept. 30.
The budgets for the State Department and U.S. Agency for
International Development would be cut 16 percent from fiscal
year 2010 levels, Clinton said. Republican leaders plan a House
vote on the proposal this week.  The lower level of funding would force the State department
to “scale back significantly” in Iraq, Afghanistan and  Pakistan , and “roll back” programs related to international
health, climate change, border security and trade promotion,
Clinton said.  The cuts “will render us unable to respond to
unanticipated disasters and will damage our leadership around
the world,” said Clinton in a letter today to House
Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican.  To contact the reporter on this story:
