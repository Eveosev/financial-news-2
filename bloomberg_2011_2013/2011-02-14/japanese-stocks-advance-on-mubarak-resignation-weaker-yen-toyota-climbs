Japan’s Topix index rose for a sixth
day as the country’s gross domestic product shrank less than
expected and after Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  resigned.
Japan’s market was closed Feb. 11 for a holiday.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, jumped
2.5 percent after the company said it will streamline its
management. Fanuc Corp., an industrial-robot manufacturer that
gets almost 80 percent of its sales overseas, climbed 3.8
percent after the yen weakened. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., the
second-largest shipping line by sales, leapt 3.8 percent after a
gauge of cargo tariffs increased. Stocks also rose after capital
investment grew.  “I see gains in capital investment as positive,” said
Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee $35 billion in Tokyo at
Mizuho Asset Management Co. “People were worried about higher  oil prices , but the concern eased after Mubarak’s resignation
and optimism about the global economy increased.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.1 percent to 10,725.54
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index gained 1.3
percent to 959.19 with more than three stocks advancing for each
that fell. The Topix’s six-day climb was the longest winning
streak since the period ending Jan. 12, 2010. All 33 industry
groups in the Topix advanced.  Japan’s economy contracted 1.1 percent on an annual basis
in the quarter ended December, its first decline in five
quarters, according to the Cabinet Office. The median forecast
of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 2 percent
drop.  Capital investment  gained 0.9 percent in the fourth
quarter from the previous three months.  Topix Valuations  The Topix has increased 6.7 percent this year, compared with
gains of 5.7 percent by the S&P 500 and 4.4 percent by the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
16.3 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.9
times for the  S&P 500  and 11.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1
percent today. In  New York , the index advanced 0.6 percent to
1,329.15 on Feb. 11 as Mubarak’s resignation and a jump in U.S.
consumer confidence to an eight-month high bolstered optimism in
the global economic recovery.    Egypt ’s ruling army council said it aims to hand power to a
democratically elected government within six months, after
popular unrest that demanded the ouster of Mubarak after 30
years in power.  ‘Worst is Behind’  After Mubarak resigned, “the worst is behind us, although
there’s still concern whether power will be transferred smoothly
in Egypt,” said Kazuhiro Takahashi, a general manager at Tokyo-
based Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co.  The preliminary estimate for Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan index of U.S. consumer sentiment for February climbed
to 75.1 from 74.2 in January. The report was issued on Feb. 11.  Toyota jumped 2.5 percent to 3,870 yen and was the biggest
single contributor to the Topix’s gain. The company said it will
cut its board to at least 17 members from the current 27 to
improve decision-making. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest
carmaker, climbed 2.8 percent to 3,640 yen, a level not seen
since September 2008. Fanuc rose 3.8 percent to 12,630 yen.  The yen depreciated to as low as 83.57 against the dollar,
compared with 82.57 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo on
Feb. 10. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Shipping Lines Advance  “The yen’s slide against the dollar will likely support
the market,” Daiwa Securities Capital Markets’s Takahashi said.  Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s No. 1 shipping line by sales,
advanced 1.3 percent to 378 yen. Mitsui O.S.K. leapt 3.8 percent
to 579 yen. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the No. 3, climbed 2.8
percent to 370 yen.  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of shipping costs for
commodities, rose for a fifth consecutive day on Feb. 11.  Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd., a department store
operator, advanced 3.7 percent to 1,037 yen, the highest level
since May 12. The company raised its full-year net income
forecast 25 percent to 15 billion yen ($180 million).  Kirin Holdings Co., Japan’s second-largest brewer, rose 2.6
percent to 1,169 yen. The company forecast net income will jump
to 58 billion yen this year from 11.4 billion in 2010.  “With strong corporate earnings, the market is reacting to
news positively,” Mizuho Asset Management’s Iwamoto said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
