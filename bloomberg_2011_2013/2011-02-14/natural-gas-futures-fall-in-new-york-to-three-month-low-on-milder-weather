Natural gas futures rose for the
first time in three days in  New York  as revised forecasts showed
weather will be colder than normal next week from the U.S.
Plains to the Northeast.  Gas gained 0.4 percent as forecasters including MDA Federal
Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in Rockville,  Maryland , said in
midday updates that temperatures won’t be as high as previous
models predicted. Futures also climbed as the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials advanced.  “The forecast that came out around noontime is helping
gas,” said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group Inc., a
consulting company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “The gas market
right now lacks direction and is just latching on the strength
in other contracts in the commodity complex.”  Natural gas for March delivery rose 1.5 cents to settle at
$3.925 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 28 percent from a
year ago.  The CRB index increased 0.3 percent to 338.76.  There will be “widespread cold across the Plains and
Midwest” late next week as well as in the Northeast, EarthSat
Energy said. The high temperature in New York on Feb. 20 will be
38 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 Celsius), 4 below normal, according
to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania, while the
high in Boston will be 31 degrees, 9 below normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Warmer This Week  The weather will be warmer than normal this week, according
to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland. The high
temperature in New York on Feb. 17 will be 56 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 degrees above normal, according to AccuWeather.  Gas has tumbled 11 percent this month.  “This is mid-February and we are not far from the end of
heating season,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG
Economics, an energy research firm in  London ,  Arkansas .    Hedge funds  and other large speculators raised bearish bets
on natural gas to the highest level since December 2008. Net-
short positions in natural gas rose to 112,081, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  U.S. gas stockpiles declined 209 billion cubic feet in the
week ended Feb. 4 to 2.144 trillion, the Energy Department
reported last week.  Storage Drop  The storage drop was bigger than the five-year average
decline of 159 billion cubic feet, department data showed. The
storage level was 2.1 percent below the five-year average,
declining to a deficit for the first time since Jan. 15, 2010.  A deficit to year-earlier supplies widened to 4.4 percent
from 2.9 percent.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
233,467 as of 2:47 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 303,000. Volume was 437,704 on Feb. 11. Open interest was
933,643 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
802,000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
