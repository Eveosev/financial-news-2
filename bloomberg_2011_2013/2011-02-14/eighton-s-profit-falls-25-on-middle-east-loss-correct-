(Corrects CEO’s name in third paragraph.)    Leighton Holdings Ltd ., Australia’s
largest construction company, said first-half profit dropped 25
percent because of losses at its Middle Eastern unit and gains
in the Australian currency.  Net income fell to A$216.7 million, or 71.3 cents a share,
in the six months to Dec. 31, from A$288.9 million, or 95.5
cents, a year earlier, the Sydney-based company said today in a
statement. Sales rose 8 percent to A$9.7 billion.  Chief Executive Officer David Stewart is focusing on
boosting business from new construction and mining projects in  Asia , the Middle East and  India . Profit was also cut by floods
and wet weather in Queensland state and  Indonesia , the company
said.  “For the 2010-2011 financial year, the group expects to
report full-year revenue of almost A$20 billion and net profit
after tax of around A$480 million,” the company said. “The
final result and full-year dividend are, however, subject to
market and operating conditions, including weather conditions in  Australia  and overseas.”  Leighton shares fell 0.9 percent to A$30.42 at 10:56 a.m.
as trading resumed in Sydney after the profit announcement. The
company will pay a first-half dividend of 60 cents.  An 18 percent gain in the Australian dollar in the half cut
revenue by A$180 million, it said. Wet weather may cut full-year
profit by about A$100 million, Leighton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
