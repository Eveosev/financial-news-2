Coffee prices rose, extending a
rally to the highest since 1997, as inventories tallied by an
industry group remain close to a 40-year low.  Jose Sette, the executive director of the  International
Coffee Organization , said that stockpiles held by exporting
nations probably will be little changed this year around 13
million bags, the lowest since the group started keeping records
in the 1960s. Prices have surged 95 percent in the past 12
months as global demand outpaced supplies.  “The horizon is not very promising,” said  Rodrigo Costa ,
the vice president of institutional sales at Newedge USA LLC in
New York. “There is no recovery in supply coming.”  In other markets, wheat prices extended a rally to the
highest since 2008 on signs that political tension in the Middle
East and North Africa is spurring governments to boost grain
imports, while drought threatens the crop in  China . Corn and
soybeans dropped. The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity
Index advanced 0.7 percent to 1,720.46.  Arabica coffee for May delivery advanced 6.75 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $2.617 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price reached $2.6225, the highest for a most-
active contract since June 1997.  Consumption may rise this year from about 131 million bags
in 2010, Sette said in a telephone interview from  London  on Feb.
11. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  “There is simply not enough coffee in the world,”
Sette said.  Wheat  Wheat futures for May delivery rose 5.25 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $9.04 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price reached $9.1675, the highest for a
most-active contract since August 2008. The grain surged 80
percent in the past year after drought slashed Russian
production and floods damaged crops in  Australia  and  Canada .    Egypt , the largest importer, on Feb. 11 agreed to buy
170,000 metric tons, including 55,000 from the U.S. Iraq is
buying wheat from the U.S. and Australia, Reuters reported.
Prices in China, the world’s largest consumer and producer,
jumped to a record after the government said snow failed to ease
dry conditions.  “Unrest in the Middle East is probably causing some
stockpiling,” said Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global
Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette,  Indiana . The
market “is able to hang on there nicely, given the Egypt tender
and expectations for more tenders from the Middle East in the
next day or two.”  Corn, Soybeans  Corn fell from a 31-month high and soybeans declined after
the government said U.S. farmers, the biggest growers, intend to
expand acreage this year after prices surged.  The area planted with corn may rise 4.3 percent to 92
million acres, the most since 2007, from 88.2 million last year,
the Department of Agriculture said today in a report. Soybean
acreage may climb 0.8 percent to a record 78 million.  “The USDA estimates were on the high side of what people
have been talking about,” said Marty Foreman, an economist at
Doane Advisory Services Co. in  St. Louis . “The revenue per acre
is very attractive to plant more acres of everything.”  Corn futures for May delivery fell 10.75 cents, or 1.5
percent, to close at $7.065 a bushel on the CBOT. Earlier, the
price reached $7.21, the highest since July 9, 2008, after the
U.S. announced 145,000 tons of export sales to  Mexico . The
commodity has surged 89 percent in the past year.  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 13 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $14.16 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched
$14.1325, the lowest for the contract since Jan. 31.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
