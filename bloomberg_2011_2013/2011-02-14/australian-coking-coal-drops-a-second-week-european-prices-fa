Australian coking coal fell for a
second week. Benchmark European coal derivatives declined for
the first time in three days.  Hard prime coking coal from  Australia  sold for $318.25 a
metric ton on average in the week to Feb. 11, down 2.1 percent
from $325 the week before, according to Petersfield, England-
based researcher IHS McCloskey.  Thermal coal from South Africa’s Richards Bay, site of the
continent’s biggest export facility for the fuel, declined 5
percent to an average $114.89 a ton for the week, McCloskey
said. That’s the lowest price since the week ended Dec. 17.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year fell 0.4 percent to $117 a ton at 11:20
a.m. in London. The data are drawn from information supplied by
