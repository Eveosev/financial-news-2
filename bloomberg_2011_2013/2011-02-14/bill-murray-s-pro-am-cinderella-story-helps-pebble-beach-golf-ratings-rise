Preliminary television ratings for
the AT&T  Pebble Beach  National Pro-Am rose 53 percent over a
year earlier as D.A. Points captured his first U.S. PGA Tour
title and comedian Bill Murray also finished a winner.  The tournament, televised by  CBS Sports , was seen in an
average of 2.6 percent of U.S households in the top 56
television markets, Jerry Caraccioli, a spokesman for the CBS
Corp. network, said in an e-mail.  The 2010 tournament drew a 1.7 rating as Dustin Johnson won
for the second straight year, with the pro-am title going to the
team of Paul Goydos and Robert Stuart, an executive for  Hertz
Global Holdings Inc .  Points, 34, shot a 5-under-par 67 during yesterday’s final
round at Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach,  California , to
finish at 15-under-par 271 for the tournament, two shots better
than Hunter Mahan.  Points also teamed with the 60-year-old Murray for a two-
shot win in the pro-am, which was first hosted in 1937 by singer
Bing Crosby. Murray -- who reprised his bumbling greenskeeper
character Carl Spackler from the 1980 movie “Caddyshack” on
the 18th green -- earned his first win since he started playing
and entertaining crowds at the tournament’s 1992 edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
