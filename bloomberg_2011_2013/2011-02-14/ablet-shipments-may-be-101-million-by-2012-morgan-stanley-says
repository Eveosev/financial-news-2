Shipments of tablet computers may
jump sixfold in two years to 101 million units in 2012,
undermining sales of video-game players and traditional personal
computers,  Morgan Stanley  said.  The shipments may increase to 65 million in 2011 from 16
million last year, the investment bank said in a report today.
The global penetration rate of tablet computers is estimated at
3 percent, compared with 75 percent for desktop computers, 63
percent for notebooks and 30 percent for smartphones, according
to the report.  The nascent market may benefit Apple Inc. and Samsung
Electronics Co. while having a “cannibalization” effect on
makers of gaming devices including Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co.,
Morgan Stanley said. Companies whose earnings are driven by
chips used in notebook computers, such as  Advanced Micro Devices
Inc ., may also see a negative impact, the report said.  Tablet computers could reduce gaming hardware shipments by
6 percent in 2011 and 10 percent in 2013, according to the
report. Sales of personal computers may be reduced by 5 percent
over the next three years. Printer makers such as Ricoh Co. may
also see a negative impact, the New York-based bank said.    ARM Holdings Plc  and  SanDisk Corp . may benefit as tablet
computers will likely boost orders for so-called Nand flash
memory, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
