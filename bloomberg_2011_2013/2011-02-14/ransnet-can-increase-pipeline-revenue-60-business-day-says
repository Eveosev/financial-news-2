Transnet Ltd., the state-owned South
African ports and pipeline operator, was provisionally granted a
60 percent increase in the revenue it can make from its fuel
pipeline system in the country, Business Day said.  Transet will be able to make 1.9 billion rand in revenue
from its pipelines in the fiscal year through 2012 compared with
1.2 billion rand previously, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said, citing a provisional ruling by the National Energy
Regulator of  South Africa . The operator, which owns 2,775
kilometers of pipelines, was seeking to more than double its
allowable revenue from its pipelines, it said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
