  Deutsche Telekom AG ’s board member
for European operations, Guido Kerkhoff, is leaving the company,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing unidentified people at the
telecommunications operator.  While Kerkhoff reached his targets for 2010, he’s been
unable to “assert himself” vis-à-vis the heads of the eastern
European units, the newspaper said.  Company spokesman Michael Lange declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
