Lithuanian state budget revenue
exceeded the governmentâ€™s target in January because of better-
than-planned tax collection.  Revenue totaled 1.56 billion litai ($609 million),
exceeding the target for the month by 52.5 million litai, the
Vilnius-based  Finance Ministry  said in a statement on its
website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
