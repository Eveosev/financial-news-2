Qatar’s Oil Minister Mohammed Saleh Al Sada was appointed chairman and managing director of state-
owned energy company Qatar Petroleum today by the country’s Emir
Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, according to a  decree  cited by the
official Qatar News Agency today.  Al Sada replaced former Oil Minister Abdullah Al-Attiyah,
who was made head of the Emir’s court last month after 19 years
as Qatar’s top energy official. Al Sada, who earned his Ph.D.
from the University of Manchester’s Institute of Science and
Technology in the U.K., will head a company that owns a majority
stake in all of Qatar’s liquefied natural gas plants.  Qatar, holder of the world’s third-largest gas reserves, is
the biggest producer in the world of LNG, gas cooled to a liquid
for transport by ship. The country has a capacity to produce 77
million tons a year of the fuel, or about 3.75 trillion cubic
feet of pipeline gas.  Qatar Petroleum also owns stakes in chemical, fertilizer,
steel and aluminum ventures as well as in LNG receiving
terminals in the U.S., U.K. and  Italy . The company recorded net
income of 35.2 billion riyals ($9.4 billion) in 2009 on 118.1
billion riyals of revenue, according to the company’s  annual
report  for that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Robert Tuttle  in Doha at
