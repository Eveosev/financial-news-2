Tanzania’s  National Bank of
Commerce , a unit of South Africa’s  Absa Group Ltd ., posted a 91
percent drop in profit last year as borrowers defaulted on
loans, the  Citizen reported .  Profit before tax declined to 5.4 billion Tanzanian
shillings ($3.6 million), from 58 billion shillings a year
earlier, the Dar es Salaam-based newspaper said, citing National
Bank Managing Director Lawrence Mafuru.  The lender plans to sell 30 percent of its shares on the
Tanzania Stock Exchange this year, the Citizen reported, without
giving further details.  National Bank’s office in  Dar es Salaam  didn’t answer calls
from Bloomberg News today seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
