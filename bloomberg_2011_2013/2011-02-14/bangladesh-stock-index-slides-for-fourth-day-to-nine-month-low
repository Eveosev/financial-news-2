Bangladesh stocks fell for a fourth
day, with the Dhaka Stock Exchange’s benchmark gauge dropping to
its lowest level in more than nine months.  The DSE General Index tumbled 7.8 percent to 5,579.50 as of
the 3 p.m. local time close in Dhaka, according to the bourse’s
website, its lowest since May 10. It has lost 18 percent since
Feb. 8. The gauge’s 7.3 percent drop yesterday prompted protests
by hundreds of investors in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka, the
Daily Star newspaper reported today. Government share sales
caused investors to panic, according to the report, which didn’t
say where it got the information from.  The benchmark index has lost 33 percent so far this year,
with trading being halted at least twice, after the central bank
raised lenders’ cash reserve ratio to limit their stock
investments. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party called a
nationwide strike last week to protest rising food prices and
the slide in stocks,  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  reported on Feb. 7.  Regulators last month eased rules to boost liquidity after
the biggest market decline in five years on Jan. 10. The DSE
General Index rallied 83 percent in 2010 and 62 percent in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
