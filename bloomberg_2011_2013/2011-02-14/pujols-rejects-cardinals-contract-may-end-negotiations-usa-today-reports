  Albert Pujols  rejected a contract
offer from the  St. Louis Cardinals , and the nine-time All-Star
may suspend negotiations for the rest of the season, USA Today
 reported  citing a person close to the first baseman.  Pujols, 31, is entering the final season of an eight-year,
$111 million contract and set a deadline this week for offseason
negotiations. The three-time National League Most Valuable
Player doesn’t want negotiations to interfere with the team as
it reports to spring training on Feb. 16 in Jupiter, Florida,
USA Today said.  Pujols led the NL with 42 home runs and 115 runs scored
last year. In his 10-year career he has batted .331 and averaged
42 home runs and 128 runs batted in per season.  Pujols is seeking a 10-year contract, according to  USA
Today . If a deal isn’t reached by Feb. 16, negotiations will be
suspended until after the season ends, at which point he will be
a free agent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
