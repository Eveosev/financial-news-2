Philippine six-year bonds fell for a
fourth day as the central bank warned that inflation risks have
increased. The peso rose, snapping a three-day drop.  Benchmark six-year bond yields surged to a three-week high
after official data showed this month that consumer prices
climbed 3.5 percent in January, the most in four months. The
central bank lifted its inflation forecast for 2011 to 4.4
percent last week from 3.6 percent earlier, while leaving the
benchmark interest rate at a record-low 4 percent.  “Worries about inflation are the biggest consideration
now,” said Rafael Algarra, a treasurer at Security Bank Corp.
in  Manila . “There is some upside risk to yields.”  The yield on the 7 percent bond due January 2016 rose 15
basis points to 6.25 percent as of 4 p.m. in Manila, the highest
level since Jan. 21, according to Tradition Financial Services.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “We are aware risks to inflation have heightened, which is
reflected in the upward adjustment in our forecasts,” central
bank Governor Amando Tetangco said today. Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas is “ready to act as and when necessary to address
these risks,” he said.  The government may sell at least 30 billion pesos ($686
million) of five- and 10-year bonds targeted at individuals as
early as next month, Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said
today.  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 43.645 per dollar, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter for this story:
