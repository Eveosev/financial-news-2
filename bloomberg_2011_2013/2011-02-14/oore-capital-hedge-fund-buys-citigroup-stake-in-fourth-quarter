Moore Capital Management LLC, the
$15 billion hedge fund run by Louis Moore Bacon, bought a stake
in Citigroup Inc. as it increased its holdings in financial
companies in the fourth quarter.  The New York-based hedge fund owned 40.9 million shares as
of Dec. 31 worth $193.7 million, according to a filing today
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Moore Capital also bought 4.2 million shares of the SPDR
KBW Bank exchange-traded fund, which tracks the KBW Bank Index
of 24 finance stocks, worth $108.8 million in the fourth
quarter, according to the filing.  The hedge fund boosted its stakes in financial companies by
15 percent during the period ending Dec. 31. Moore sold its
holdings in Materials Select Sector SPDR Trust, an ETF that
tracks companies in the chemicals and construction industry.  Patrick Clifford, a Moore Capital spokesman, declined to
