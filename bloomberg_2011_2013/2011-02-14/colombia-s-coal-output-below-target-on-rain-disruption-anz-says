Colombian coal output trailed state-
set targets last year because heavy rains disrupted production,
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said.    Colombia , which exports coal to Europe, increased
production by 2 percent to 74.35 million metric tons in 2010
compared with a government target of 80 million, Marcus Pearl,
director for commodity sales at the bank in  Singapore , said in
an e-mailed note today. Port capacity may expand at a slower
rate than fuel output, with a shortfall of 4 million tons in
2015 and 24.4 million by 2019, Pearl said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
