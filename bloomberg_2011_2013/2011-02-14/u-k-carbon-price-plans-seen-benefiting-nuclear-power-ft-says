Britain’s nuclear power industry
could reap a ‘windfall’ of as much as 3.4 billion pounds ($5.5
billion) between 2013 and 2026 as a result of government plans
to set a minimum carbon price, according to green campaigners,
the Financial Times reported.  Nick Molho, who heads  energy policy  at the World Wildlife
Fund, said giving windfall profits to existing nuclear plants,
from which further waste liability costs are likely to be
incurred, is “against the interest of the U.K. taxpayer,” the
newspaper reported.  A floor-price for carbon would make coal- and gas-fired
plants costlier to run and these costs would be passed on to
customers; nuclear power, which doesn’t burn fossil fuels,
wouldn’t have to pay the increased carbon price but would
benefit from the higher electricity price, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
