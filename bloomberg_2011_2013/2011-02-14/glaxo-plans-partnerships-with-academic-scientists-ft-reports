  GlaxoSmithKline Plc  wants to enter
into long-term partnerships with prominent academic scientists,
with the aim of developing pharmaceuticals more cheaply and
effectively, the Financial Times reported.  The company would work closely with the partner-academics
over the years needed to develop and introduce drugs, using
their expertise and providing substantial rewards if the
treatments were successful, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
