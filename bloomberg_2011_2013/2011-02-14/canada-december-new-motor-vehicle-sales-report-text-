motor vehicles sold in December declined 4.8% to 128,210 units.
Sales of both passenger cars and trucks decreased, with weaker
truck sales accounting for most of the overall decline.  Preliminary industry data indicate that the number of new motor

light and heavy trucks, vans and buses) were down 6.9% to 69,998

monthly estimates. With the release of data in April, seasonally
adjusted monthly figures for 2010 will be revised to equal the
sum of the unadjusted estimates.  New motor vehicles sales were down 7.6% in the region formed by
British Columbia and the territories.  Sales in Alberta fell 5.9% in December, offsetting the gains in
November.  Number of new motor vehicles sold increases in 2010
The number of new motor vehicles sold rose 6.7% in 2010. Truck
sales rose 18.4%, while passenger car sales fell 4.8%. Truck
sales represented 55% of the new vehicles sold in 2010,
surpassing annual passenger car sales for the first time since
this series began in 1946. Purchases of trucks for both personal
and commercial use contributed to this annual growth. The number
of new motor vehicles sold increased in all provinces except
Nova Scotia, which reported a small decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
