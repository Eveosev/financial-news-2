  Michael Kurtz , head of Asian
strategy at Macquarie Capital Securities Ltd., comments on the
outlook for Indian and Chinese stocks. He spoke in an interview
in Mumbai today.  “Both markets are underweight in our regional portfolio
allocation. The two face very different challenges. China’s are,
at least for the next couple of years, much more structural and
unavoidable. China has to begin reducing long-standing subsidies
to its enterprise sector in order to increase the household
income’s take in national income. This implies medium- to long-
term headwinds for Chinese corporates.  In India’s case, the risks can be much more short term. If
we can get past the cyclical overhang of monetary tightening and
inflation risks, if we can get beyond the political
uncertainties, the way could be open for a substantial better
relative performance in the second half of the year. Given the
fact that India seems to be capable of achieving structural GDP
growth rates that increasingly are very competitive relative to
the GDP growth rates of  China , you can make the case that  India 
will be the market to be in, in a 12- to 18-month time
horizon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
