  Barratt Developments Plc , the U.K.’s
largest housebuilder by volume, is pondering moving into
London’s rental market as it seeks to counter the effects of
limited mortgage availability, the Financial Times reported,
citing a person familiar with the company. Barratt is
considering building and managing a large portfolio of rental
developments in order to take advantage of  London ’s “healthy”
rental market, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
