The yen traded near a one-week high
against the euro before a report that economists said will show  China ’s consumer-price inflation accelerated last month, fueling
concern the central bank will take more measures to cool growth.  The euro was close to the lowest in three weeks versus the
greenback on speculation European finance ministers meeting for
a second day today will fail to agree on measures to shield  Portugal  from the region’s debt crisis.  Australia ’s dollar
traded about 0.2 percent below this year’s high versus New
Zealand’s before the larger South Pacific nation’s central bank
releases minutes of this month’s policy meeting.  “China’s strong CPI data may suggest the pace of
tightening is too slow,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, a senior
currency analyst in Tokyo at Ueda Harlow Ltd., which provides
foreign-exchange margin-trading services. “The yen is likely to
be bought should stocks decline following the data, cooling risk
sentiment in the markets.”  The yen traded at 112.37 per euro as of 8:31 a.m. in Tokyo
from 112.40 in  New York  yesterday, when it rose to 112.09, the
strongest since Feb. 9. Japan’s currency was at 83.33 per dollar
from 83.32. The euro bought $1.3486 from $1.3489 yesterday, when
it dropped to $1.3428, the weakest since Jan. 20.  The Australian dollar was at NZ$1.3263 from NZ$1.3252
yesterday, when it climbed to NZ$1.3284, the most since Dec. 29.  Chinese consumer prices advanced 5.4 percent in January
from a year earlier, the most since July 2008, according to a
Bloomberg survey before today’s report.  ‘Stable’ Markets  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told reporters
yesterday “stable” financial markets ease pressure for a boost
in the  Europe ’s 440 billion-euro ($593 billion) rescue fund.  “The markets are so stable right now that it’s better not
to unsettle them with superfluous discussions,” Schaeuble said
before European finance ministers met yesterday in Brussels.  The finance chiefs emerged from yesterday’s session without
announcing immediate steps to counter the debt crisis.
Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-
area finance ministers, said the lending capacity for the
permanent stability mechanism to be established in 2013 will be
500 billion euros and will be regularly monitored.  -- Editors: Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporters on this story:
