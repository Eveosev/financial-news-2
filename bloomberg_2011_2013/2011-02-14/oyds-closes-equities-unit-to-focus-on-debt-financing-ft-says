  Lloyds Banking Group Plc  has shut
its equities business as it seeks to divert its investment
banking operations away from high-risk areas, the Financial
Times reported, citing the bank.  The decision to withdraw from equity markets is a
“strategic” move and based on “a refocusing of efforts
against our core strengths of providing debt financing solutions
to U.K. customers,” the FT reported, citing a spokesperson for
Lloyds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
