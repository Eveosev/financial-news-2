Appaloosa Management LP, the hedge
fund founded David Tepper, bought shares of  Bank of America
Corp . and  Micron Technology Inc . while more than doubling its
position in  Citigroup Inc . during the fourth quarter.  Appaloosa purchased 2.59 million shares of Bank of America
in the period that ended Dec. 31, boosting its stake to 25.1
million, and opened a 17.8 million share stake in Micron,
according to a filing today. Its ownership in Citigroup jumped
to 117.5 million shares, an increase of 66.3 million.  Tepper ran the top fund among hedge funds with assets over
$1 billion in 2009 when he returned 132 percent to investors.
The same fund earned 21 percent in 2010. He personally made
between $2 billion and $3 billion in 2010, according to the Wall
Street Journal.  The Short Hills, New Jersey-based hedge fund also took new
positions in  General Motors Co . and JPMorgan Chase & Co. It
established equity investments in 12 new companies, boosted its
holding in 26 -- including Microsoft Corp. and  Hewlett-Packard
Co . -- sold some holdings in 11 stocks and closed positions in 7
companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Appaloosa is the subject of a probe of whether it together
with three other hedge funds committed insider trading in
Seattle-based Washington Mutual Inc. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath said last week that shareholders can question the
hedge funds regarding their use of confidential information to
trade in the bankrupt companyâ€™s securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
