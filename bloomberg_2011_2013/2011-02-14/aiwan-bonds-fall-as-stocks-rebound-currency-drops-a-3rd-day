Taiwan government bonds fell,
snapping a two-day gain, on speculation investors are favoring
stocks after a report late last week showed exports increased in
January by more than economists predicted.  The island’s Taiex index of shares gained for the first
time in five days as Asian equities rallied following the
resignation of  Egypt ’s President  Hosni Mubarak . Overseas
shipments climbed 16.6 percent from a year earlier last month,
more than the median estimate for 15 percent growth in a
Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  “The rebound in Taiwan stocks is driving up bond yields,”
said George Pu, a fixed-income trader at President Securities
Corp. in Taipei. “Short selling volume is about NT$12 billion
($410 million).” A short sale is a bet an asset price will fall.  The yield on the 1 percent bond due January 2016 closed one
basis point higher at 1.119 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market, the island’s biggest debt exchange. Yields
climbed five basis points last week.  The Taiex index of shares advanced 0.9 percent after losing
5.9 percent last week, the biggest five-day decline since May.    Taiwan ’s dollar dropped for a third day. The currency
slipped 0.3 percent to NT$29.329 against its U.S. counterpart as
of the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
