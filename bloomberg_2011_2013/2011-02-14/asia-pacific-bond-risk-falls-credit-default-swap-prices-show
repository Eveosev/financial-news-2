The cost of protecting bonds in the
Asia-Pacific region from non-payment fell, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 3 basis points to 107.5 basis
points as of 8:32 a.m. in Beijing, Credit Agricole CIB prices
show. The risk benchmark is heading for its biggest decline
since Feb. 7, according to CMA in  New York .  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 3.5 basis points to
105.5 as of 9:39 a.m. in Sydney, Nomura Holdings Inc. prices
show. The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1.5 basis points to
102.5 as of 9:35 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Citigroup Inc.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  --Henry Sanderson. Editors: Will McSheehy  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:  Henry Sanderson  in Beijing at 86-10-6649-7548 or
