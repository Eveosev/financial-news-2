Brazilian economists  forecast 
inflation will continue to accelerate, and  interest rates  rise
more than previously expected, signaling 50 billion reais ($30
billion) in budget cuts may not be enough to cool the world’s
8th-largest economy. Yields on interest rate futures jumped.  Economists raised their forecast for 2011 inflation for a
10th straight week to 5.75 percent from a week earlier forecast
of 5.66 percent, according to the median estimate in a Feb. 11
central bank survey of about 100 economists published today. The
economists raised their 2012 inflation forecast to 4.7 percent,
up from 4.61 percent last week.  Yields on interest rate futures contracts maturing in Jan.
2013, the most traded today in  Sao Paulo , rose 11 basis points
to 12.88 percent at 7:30 a.m. New York time. The real was little
changed at 1.6683 per  U.S. dollar .  Borrowing costs will end 2012 at 11.25 percent, up from a
week-earlier forecast of 11 percent, the survey found. President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government last week pledged to slash spending
from this year’s budget to ease pressure on the central bank to
raise interest rates.  “The message is that it’s going to take longer than
expected for inflation to converge to the target,” said Eduardo Alves de Castro, who helps manage about 110 billion reais at
Santander Asset Management in Sao Paulo. “There are still
doubts on how the government will deliver its 50 billion reais
of budget cuts.”  ‘Unfulfilled’ Ambition  Rousseff’s ambition to cut real, or inflation-adjusted,
interest rates to 2 percent from more than 5 percent today
“will probably go unfulfilled”, said  Neil Shearing , an
emerging markets economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in  London .  Brazil  has the highest real interest rates in the Group of 20
nations.  “This is hardly a ringing endorsement of the plans,”
Shearing said, in reply to an e-mailed question.  Traders are wagering that the central bank will raise its
benchmark Selic rate 0.5 percentage point to 11.75 percent at
its next policy meeting in March, according to Bloomberg
estimates based on interest rate futures yields.  Inflation accelerated to 5.99 percent in the 12 months
through January, the fastest pace since November 2008. The
government targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  Policy makers raised the benchmark rate to 11.25 percent
from 10.75 percent last month, the first increase since July.  Gross domestic product will expand 4.5 percent in 2011,
down from last week’s forecast of 4.6 percent, the survey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
