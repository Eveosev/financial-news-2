Following is the text of the U.S.
Farm Income report from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture :  Net Farm Income Forecast Up Nearly 20 Percent in 2011  Net farm income is forecast to be $94.7 billion in 2011, up
$15.7 billion (19.8 percent) from the 2010 forecast. The 2011
forecast is the second highest inflation-adjusted value for net
farm income recorded in the past 35 years. The top five earnings
years for the past three decades have occurred since 2004,
attesting to the profitability of farming this decade.  Net cash income, at $98.6 billion, is forecast up $7.3 billion
(8%) from 2010, and $26.8 billion above its 10-year average
(2000-2009) of $71.8 billion. Net farm income reflects income
from production in the current year, whether or not sold within
the calendar year; net cash income reflects only the cash
transactions occurring within the calendar year. Net farm income
is a measure of the increase in wealth from production, whereas
net cash income is a measure of solvency, or the ability to pay
bills and make payments on debt. Net value added is expected to
increase by almost $18.4 billion in 2011 to $147.4 billion. The
net value added of agriculture to the  U.S. economy  forecast for
2011 is also the second highest inflation-adjusted value
recorded in the past 35 years, trailing only the 1974 value.  Net farm income and net value added, 1999-2011f d
Highlights  All three measures of farm sector earnings are forecast to
rise in 2011, but at more moderate rates than projected for 2010.  -Net cash income is expected to rise nearly 8 percent from
2010 after an estimated rise of 32 percent in 2010.  -Net value added, at $147.4 billion, is expected to be
$18.4 billion above the value from 2010 and will be 31.8 percent
above its 10-year average. An increase in feed crop receipts
accounted for the bulk of the upward movement in net value added.
The values of feed crops, cotton, and oil crops are all
projected to rise by more than 20 percent in 2011.  -Net farm income, is forecast to rise 19.8 percent in 2011,
following the 27 percent increase recorded in 2010.  The forecast is for a rise of 9.1 percent in cash receipts
from sales of farm commodities.  - Crop receipts are expected to increase $24.1 billion,
with cotton, soybean, wheat, and corn receipts expected to show
the largest gains.  - Livestock receipts are expected to increase $4.3 billion
in 2011, led by rising cash receipts for cattle and calves.  Total expenses are forecast to increase by $20.2 billion,
exceeding $300 billion for the first time.  - Total production expenses in 2011 are forecast to be 7
percent higher, accelerating from the estimated 2.2-percent
increase in 2010.  Government payments are forecast to be $10.6 billion in
2011, a 12.7-percent decrease from 2010.  Amounts in this article are in nominal dollars. Estimates and
forecasts in constant (2005=100) dollars are available.
Double-Digit Increases in Crop Cash Receipts Expected in 2011  Crop receipts are expected to rise over 14 percent in 2011,
achieving a record high, as large increases are expected across
a number of crop categories. In particular, corn for grain and
soybeans are expected to achieve record high sales.  Food grain cash receipts are expected to increase almost 15
percent in 2011, after declining almost 1 percent in 2010.
Nevertheless, food grain receipts are predicted to remain below
their 2008 highs. Wheat sales, which are expected to account for
83 percent of 2011 food grain receipts, are expected to increase
almost 20 percent. The quantity of wheat sold is expected to
rise in 2010 as wheat prices fall about 16 cents per bushel, but
decline almost 10 percent in 2011 as the price of wheat jumps
$1.66 per bushel. In marketing year 2010 (June 2010-May 2011),
wheat food and seed use is expected to return to 2008 marketing
year levels; feed and residual use will recover almost one-fifth
of its previous decline while wheat exports are expected to see
an almost 50-percent increase over the previous marketing-year
level. Projections of a large increase in U.S. wheat exports
reflect tight foreign supplies of high-quality wheat, abundant
U.S. supplies, and the U.S. position as the first major wheat
exporter to harvest wheat. Despite an expected price increase
for rice in 2011, projected declines in quantity sold are
expected to result in reduced rice receipts.  Feed crop receipts are expected to increase almost 21 percent to
a record level in 2011. Sales of corn for grain, which are
expected to account for almost 87 percent of 2011 feed crop
receipts, are expected to increase over 23 percent. While the
quantity of corn sold in 2011 is expected to decline slightly,
this will be more than offset by a $1.09-per-bushel increase in
its price. Increased demand for corn is coming mostly from its
use in ethanol production, which is expected to rise on
strengthening exports. Price increases are also expected in 2011
for sorghum grain, barley, oats, and hay. While expectations of
increased prices for farmers means increased sales are expected
for sorghum, oats, and hay, a countervailing decline in 2011
quantity sold for barley is expected to reduce the value of its
sales.  Receipts for oil crops are expected to achieve record highs in
2011 as soybean receipts increase over 27 percent. The large
increase in soybean receipts reflects a large expected price
rise of over $2 per bushel, combined with an anticipated 5.5-
percent rise in quantity sold in 2011. Soybean exports are
expected to reach record quantities sold in the 2010 marketing
year (September 2010-August 2011). Peanut sales in 2011 are
expected to increase over 22 percent, reflecting increased
quantities sold at higher prices.  Cotton receipts are expected to rise by more than one-third in
2011. Increases in prices and quantities sold are expected for
both cotton lint and seed. The U.S. is the world’s leading
cotton exporter and is predicted to increase its exports 31
percent in the 2010 marketing year (August 2010 - July 2011) to
their second highest level on record. A small increase is
expected in sales of fruits and tree nuts, reflecting a less
than 0.4-percent projected rise in prices. Large increases in
quantities sold are forecast for avocados (39.2 percent) and
pecans (23.9 percent), while a large decline is forecast for
walnuts (35.5 percent). Expectations of increased potato and dry
bean receipts are more than offset by forecast declines in
receipts for other vegetables.  Dairy receipts are expected to increase by 2.8 percent in 2011
as milk prices received by farmers increase slightly by
$0.20/cwt. Dairy cow numbers are expected to increase slightly
in 2011, as is the milk-per-cow ratio. U.S. milk exports are
projected to be lower in 2011 due to competition from  Australia 
and  New Zealand , despite strong demand from Asian and South
American countries. Meanwhile, cattle and calf cash receipts are
anticipated to increase 4.9 percent, despite declining
production in 2011, as global demand for U.S. beef is expected
to remain strong. Despite higher feed costs, hog cash receipts
are expected to increase 2.9 percent in 2011 due to increased
pork production coupled with greater pork exports. Broiler cash
receipts are expected to increase almost 1.9 percent in 2011,
with increases in production offset by strong broiler export
demand. Through November 2010, year-over-year broiler shipments
had increased 26 percent due to strong demand from  Russia ,  Mexico ,  Hong Kong ,  Angola , and  Vietnam . Egg cash receipts are
expected to decrease 3.45 percent in 2011 due to lower year-
over-year prices in 2011.  Estimating Calendar-Year Cash Receipts With Crop Marketing Year
Data  USDA income and value-added annual estimates, such as cash
receipts, are measured in calendar years (January 1 through
December 31). Crop marketing years are 12-month periods
capturing farm operations’ economic activity from the beginning
of a new harvest through when the crop is typically sold. The
U.S. has a marketing year for each crop, but different marketing
years can exist for the same crop grown in different States. For
example, the corn for grain crop marketing year for the U.S.,  Iowa , and Illinois is September 1 through August 31, whereas for
Florida and  Georgia  it is August 1 through July 31, and for
certain other States it is October 1 through September 30.
Livestock and some crop marketing years coincide with calendar
years.
For crops that are marketed across two calendar years (say 2009
and 2010), ERS uses the share marketed in 2009 in its estimate
of 2009 cash receipts, while the remainder is used in the
estimate for cash receipts for 2010. For example, suppose 30
percent of Illinois corn harvested in 2009 is sold in the open
market from September through December of 2009 with the
remaining 70 percent sold from January through August of 2010.
Cash receipts from open-market sales in 2009 would include the
share of Illinois’ harvest that was sold in 2009. The share of
the 2009 harvest sold in 2010 would be added to the share of the
2010 harvest sold in 2010 to arrive at  Illinois ’ 2010 cash
receipts from open-market sales of corn. To the amount received
from open-market sales, ERS adds cash received from “sales” to
the CCC to obtain the calendar-year estimate for cash receipts.  After falling $12.0 (4.1 percent) billion in 2009 and rebounding
a relatively modest $6.5 billion (2.3 percent) in 2010, total
production expenses are set to jump $20.2 billion (7.0 percent)
in 2011 to a nominal record $307.5 billion. The 2011 jump
resembles the large increases in production expenses in 2007 and
2008. This is the first time that expenses will have exceeded
$300 billion. Despite crossing this threshold, 2011 inflation-
adjusted expenses still remain below the levels reached in 1979
and 1980.  With respect to factors affecting total expenses, on the price
side, the Production Items, Interest, Taxes, and Wage Rate
(PITW) prices-paid index should be up 4.3 percent. On the
quantity side, total production (and therefore the quantity of
inputs used) is predicted to increase by 4.2 percent for crops
and 0.4 percent for livestock. Even with the sizeable jump,
total expenses as a percent of gross farm income, at 77 percent,
will be 1 percent lower than in 2010.  Every expense except livestock and poultry purchases is forecast
to increase in 2011. Feed is expected to rise $4.6 billion;
miscellaneous expenses, $2.8 billion; fertilizer and lime, $2.6
billion; and fuels and oils, $2.5 billion. Total labor, repair
and maintenance, and net rent to nonoperator landlords should
each climb more than $1 billion.  The increase in expenses will affect crop and livestock farms
differently. Even though the principal expenses for each type of
farm are going up nearly the same--crop-related expenses should
increase around $4.2 billion while livestock-related expenses
should increase $4.4 billion--crop cash receipts are forecast to
rise 14 percent compared to a 3-percent rise in livestock cash
receipts. Because of this, the rise in livestock-related
expenses will impinge on net incomes of livestock farms more
than crop farms. The following two charts show how certain
expenses affect different farm types.  After rising $18.9 billion (67 percent) from 2006 to 2008, feed
expenses fell almost $2 billion in 2009 and are expected to be
nearly flat in 2010. In 2011, feed expenses are forecast to
again make a sizeable jump, going up $4.6 billion (10.2 percent).
The two factors contributing to the forecast are a 9.7-percent
increase in the feed prices-paid index and a modest projected
rise in livestock output. The reason for the upward movement in
the feed prices-paid index is the jump in feed grain and oilseed
prices. The calendar-year price for corn, which constitutes over
90 percent of feed grains used, will be up 26 percent in 2011.
The calendar-year price for soybeans, the primary ingredient in
soymeal, the principal oilseed feedstock, is expected to be up
around 15 percent. The increase in the feed prices-paid index
will not be as great as the increase in these prices because
price changes for complete feeds, which have the heaviest weight
in the index, lag price changes in raw inputs used to
manufacture complete feeds. The feed, seed, and residual use of
feed grains will be up in 2011. The demand for feed from
feedlots will be heavier than the number of cattle-on-feed
placements indicate. Lighter feeder cattle are being sent to
feedlots because of poor pasture conditions in some areas. These
cattle will consume more feed while in the feedlot.  Livestock and poultry purchases is the only expense category
that will not increase in 2011. It is forecast to be little
changed, with a decrease of less than 1 percent expected. Since
cattle account for 75 percent of this expense, conditions in the
cattle market are the main driver of these purchases. The
primary reason that this expense will not rise is that, in 2011,
the number of cattle on feed is expected to be lower than in
2010. Normally, this slack demand would lower the price of
feeder cattle. However, despite the lowered demand, lighter
cattle being pushed into lots, and continued high cow slaughter,
feeder cattle prices are predicted to rise nearly 6 percent
because of abnormally tight inventories and relatively high
retail beef prices. With the high retail prices, feedlot
operators are able to earn favorable returns despite higher
feeder cattle and feed costs. With respect to other animals,
pork production should be up 1 percent, but farm prices will be
down almost the same amount. Broiler production and prices
should both be up a small amount.  Crop-related expenses grew 77 percent between 2002 and 2008,
with 48 percent of the rise occurring in 2007-08. During 2009-10,
the climb stalled and crop-related expenses fell nearly 10
percent. The primary reason for this pattern was movements in
fertilizer expenses, which jumped 134 percent during 2002-08 and
then dropped 19 percent in 2009-10. Crop-related expenses are
expected to rise 9.5 percent in 2011, again due largely to an
expected increase of more than 14 percent in fertilizer expenses.  The principal driver of crop-related expenses throughout 2002-
2011 has been changing input prices. Acres planted to principal
crops have not been a factor in the long-term growth in these
expenses since they have never exceeded the 327 million acres
planted in 2002. Use of pesticides and more expensive seeds with
increasingly complex genetic traits has increased, and this
demand has been a factor in rising prices over this period.
Increases in the price of natural gas, a principal source of
many fertilizers, have contributed to the rise in fertilizer
prices. The average annual price for natural gas was $2.95 per
thousand cubic feet (tcf) in 2002. Its price in 2008, the year
of the greatest rise in fertilizer prices, was $7.96 per tcf.  Prices for all crop-related inputs are also expected to be up in
2011, but acres planted to principal crops will be a factor this
year, as they are forecast to rise to 326 million acres, a 9.6-
million-acre (3-percent) increase over 2010. Overall, grain and
oilseed production should be up nearly 6 percent. In particular,
production of corn, a heavy user of inputs, is forecast to rise
10.5 percent as acreage planted to corn expands almost 4 million
acres. Production of fruits and nuts should be up more than 2
percent, vegetables production is expected to be nearly the same,
and cotton production is forecast up 9 percent.  After declining for 2 years, crop-related expenses will rise
sharply in 2011  Between 1999 and 2008, prices paid for seeds rose 146 percent,
with 64 percent of that rise occurring during 2006-09, and seed
expenses have increased $8.3 billion (115 percent). During the
2006-08 period alone, seed expenses jumped $ $4.1 billion (37
percent). The upward movement in seed costs is forecast to have
stalled in 2010, with seed expenses dropping less than 2 percent.
In 2011, seed purchases are predicted to rise over $800 million
(5.3 percent) because of a rise of slightly more than 2 percent
in prices paid for seeds and the 3-percent expansion of acres
planted.  Fertilizer prices rose steadily between 2002 and 2008, with the
annual average prices paid for fertilizers climbing 264 percent.
During this period, fertilizer expenses rose $12.9 billion (134
percent). These increases abruptly halted in 2009, when
fertilizer expenses dropped $2.4 billion (11 percent), and they
are projected to have dropped another $1.9 billion (9 percent)
in 2010. In 2011, fertilizer expenses are forecast to resume
their climb, going up $2.6 billion (14 percent) as annual
average prices paid rise 11.0 percent. One factor in this
increase will be higher demand due to the increase in planted
acreage. Also, the cost of oil, which influences the cost of
many fertilizers, will likely continue to go up throughout 2011.  Pesticide expenses rose steadily from 2002 to 2008. In 2007 and
2008 alone, they rose $2.7 billion (30.0 percent). Since prices
paid for pesticides went up only 8.4 percent during those 2
years, increased use was also a major reason for increases in
this expense. Even though prices paid for pesticides continued
to increase in 2009, pesticide expenditures fell slightly.
Another decrease of 3.5 percent ($400 million) is predicted in
2010 as prices paid for pesticides have fallen 2.5 percent and
planted acreage declined. During 2009 and 2010, pesticide
expenses will have fallen more than 5 percent. In 2011,
pesticide expenses are forecast to rise around $800 million (7.2
percent) as a result of a 4.0-percent rise in prices paid and
the increase in planted acres.  As with fertilizer, prices paid for fuel rose dramatically
between 2002 and 2008. During this period, annual average prices
paid for fuel jumped 207 percent, registering 6 straight double-
digit percentage increases, and fuel and oil expenses shot up
$9.6 billion (146 percent). Prices paid for fuels then fell 34
percent in 2009 and expenditures dipped $3.5 billion (22
percent). Annual average prices paid for fuels were back up 22
percent in 2010 and expenditures are projected to have risen
$2.9 billion (22 percent). In 2011, prices paid are forecast to
rise another 13 percent as Refiner Acquisition Cost (RAC) goes
up 19.0 percent. The price movement and increased acreage are
forecast to raise expenditures for fuels and oils by $2.5
billion (16.0 percent).  The 3 manufactured inputs--fertilizer, pesticides, and fuels and
oils--together climbed $26.0 billion (106 percent) in the 2002-
08 period. They then fell back $6.1 billion (12 percent) as they
all decreased in 2009. In 2010, they are projected to have risen
a modest 1.3 percent, less than the increase in total
expenditures. They are forecast up $5.9 billion (13 percent) in
2011, bringing them back to their level in 2008.
Payments to Stakeholders Rise with Total Expenses  Payments to stakeholders, a claimant of net value added, do not
generally track movements in net farm income. The year-to-year
consistency in payments to stakeholders follows from the fact
that they do not share the risk of equity holders. In 2011,
payments to stakeholders are forecast to be up $2.6 billion (5.4
percent). They are expected to constitute 17.2 percent of total
production expenses (about the same as in 2010), and 36 percent
of net value added (3 percent less than in 2010). All three
components--hired labor, net rent to nonoperators, and interest
expenses--are set to increase.  Total labor expenses are forecast to rise $1.3 billion (4.5
percent) as a result of a 1.7-percent rise in wage rates and the
increase in total output. Employee compensation for hired labor
should rise $1.2 billion (4.7 percent). Output on types of farms
that employ the most labor--vegetables, fruits and nuts,
greenhouse and nursery, and dairy--will all be up. Cash receipts
on all these farms except vegetables will be up (around 1
percent in total). However, this rather small increase follows
an 11-percent rise in cash receipts on these farms in 2010. With
prospects for further increases in net incomes, producers will
likely continue to hire workers at a higher rate than in recent
years.  Net rent to nonoperator landlords is expected to increase $1.1
billion (11 percent) in 2011. Cash rent is forecast to rise
nearly 13 percent due to the increase in crop acreage and a 6-
percent increase in real estate values. Share rent is forecast
to rise 18 percent, in line with the 14-percent increase in crop
cash receipts. Both cash and share rent will be affected by the
3-percent expansion in planted acres. Both government payments
and FCIC indemnities are projected to fall in 2011.  Interest expenses are forecast to rise around $0.4 billion (3
percent) in 2011, driven by a rise in real estate interest
expenses.  Even though real estate debt will fall slightly, real
estate interest rates are forecast to increase in 2011. Nonreal
estate interest expenses should be down marginally as nonreal
estate debt rises 2 percent but interest rates fall. Debt and  interest rates  are discussed more fully in the balance sheet
chapter.
Government Payments Forecast at $10.6 Billion  Government payments paid directly to producers are expected to
total $10.6 billion in 2011, representing a 12.7 percent
decrease from the forecast of $12.2 billion paid out in 2010.
Direct payments under the Direct and Countercyclical Program
(DCP) and the Average Crop Revenue Election Program (ACRE) are
forecast at $4.65 billion for 2011. Direct payment rates are
fixed in legislation and are not affected by the level of
program crop prices. The 5.7-percent decline in direct payments
forecast in 2011 relative to the 5-year average is due to
producers having enrolled in the ACRE program. Authorized under
the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, ACRE provides
revenue insurance to producers in exchange for a 20-percent
reduction in their annual direct payment allotments beginning
with the 2009 crop year.  With respect to program payments based on  price levels , strong
commodity crop prices are expected to persist through 2011. A
95-percent reduction in ACRE revenue insurance payments from
$430 million in 2010 to $20 million in 2011 is also expected. No
countercyclical payments are forecasted to be made to producers.
Producers are expected to receive only $20 million in marketing
loan benefits - including loan deficiency payments, marketing
loan gains, and certificate exchange gains. This payout
represents a projected decline of 93 percent from 2010 levels.  The Milk Income Loss Contract Program (MILC) compensates dairy
producers when domestic milk prices fall below a specified level.
For 2011, fluctuating milk prices are expected to induce $200
million in MILC payments. Forecast at $780 million in 2011,
Tobacco Transition Payment Program (TTP) payments are expected
to continue their declining trend in 2011. Payments reported
here include both CCC payments and lump-sum payments. Begun in
2005, this program provides annual payments over a 10-year
period to eligible quota holders and producers of tobacco. Since
the inception of the program, lump-sum payments to individuals
have been made through agreements with third parties in return
for the producers’ and quota owners’ rights to the 10-year TTP
payment stream.  Conservation programs include all conservation programs operated
by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) that provide direct payments to
producers. Estimated conservation payments of $3.03 billion in
2011 reflect programs being brought up toward funding levels
authorized by current legislation.  Ad hoc and emergency disaster program payments are forecast to
be $1.9 billion in 2011, a 31 percent decrease from 2010 levels.
The 2008 Farm Act created a permanent fund for disaster
assistance, the Agricultural Disaster Relief Trust Fund.
Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments (SURE) from this fund
and from the 2009 Recovery Act are expected to amount to $994
billion in 2011. All other disaster programs--including
primarily the Emergency Conservation Program, Livestock Forage
Program (LFP), Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), and Noninsured
Assistance Program--are functioning at existing statutory
authority and appropriation levels. Once a county is declared
eligible for  disaster relief , producer participation in these
programs depends on the extent to which their crop or livestock
losses meet a particular program’s threshold.  Whether expressed in nominal dollars or constant dollars, the
forecast 2011 government payments would represent the smallest
volume paid to producers since 1997. However, the importance of
government payments as a percent of net cash farm income varies
by ERS production region.  Farm Income Forecasts Grow More Refined Over 19 Months  The periodic farm income forecasts and estimates published by
ERS for a particular year (5 over a span of 19 months) can vary
markedly from one release to the next. For example, the first
forecast of 2010 income (in February 2010) has undergone
painstaking refinement as new information has become available.
Release dates for the updated forecasts correspond with the
availability of seasonal data and annual survey results. For
example, the August update of annual crop values benefited from
preliminary output and yield numbers as reported by producers in
the field. Likewise, because the prior-year’s (2009’s) forecast
was converted to estimates in August, production expenses could
be extrapolated from these new estimates and several months of
current-year input prices. Additional refinements in this
(February 2011) and the August 2011 releases incorporate harvest,
sales, and inventory data. Ultimately, an estimate of 2010 farm
income will be published in August 2011.  Individual components of the farm income accounts adhere to
different timetables and are subject to varying degrees of
uncertainty. For instance, crop inventory adjustment is a
residual component of total supply (production and beginning-of-
year stocks) and use (domestic and exports). Farm household
income is contingent on many factors (amount of off-farm work
hours and wage rates) that transcend crop and livestock numbers.
Government payments--which are a function of prices, production,
eligibility rules, and ad hoc disaster legislation--are also
hard to forecast with any certainty, and that uncertainty
compounds the margin of error that measures like net cash income
are subject to from first forecast to final estimate.  Crop and livestock receipt forecasts tighten significantly as
additional price and output data become available during the
forecast period. As a result, by harvest time, the relative
error (between forecast and actual totals) is generally less
than 2 percent for total cash income and less than 5 percent for
net farm income. Of course, in absolute terms this can amount to
as much as $4 billion across the farm sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
