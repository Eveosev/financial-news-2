  Viacom Inc ., owner of MTV Networks
and Paramount Pictures, plans to issue $500 million of 10-year
notes, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The securities may yield 110 to 115 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set. A basis point is 0.01 of a
percentage point.  Proceeds may be used to finance the company’s partial
tender offer for 6.25 percent senior notes due 2016 and to repay
borrowings under a revolving credit facility due 2013 and
commercial paper, said the person.  The securities may be rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors
Service and BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
