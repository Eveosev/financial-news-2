Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister
Daniel Ayalon said that  Iran  must be prevented from exploiting
the period of transition in  Egypt  and elsewhere in the Middle
East to “meddle” as it has done with the Palestinians.  “It is incumbent on all of us to make sure this period of
transition, vulnerabilities and uncertainties will not be used
by Iran, the ayatollahs of Iran, and their proxies in the
region, whether it is Hamas or Hezbollah,” Ayalon said on the
“Today” program of the British Broadcasting Corp.’s Radio 4.  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down on Feb. 11
after 18 days of protests against his regime. His resignation
has fueled pro-democracy protests across the Middle East and
North Africa and heightened pressure on rulers from Yemen to  Jordan  to Iran to ease their grip on power.  Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, told worshippers this
month that “the Iranian nation is witnessing the echo of its
voice in other parts of the Muslim world.”  Ayalon also named Lebanon as a place where Iran has “been
unfortunately effective in meddling.” Israel says that the
Shiite Muslim Hezbollah militia in Lebanon is armed by Iran as
is the Islamic militant Hamas group that rules Gaza.  To contact the reporter on this story:
