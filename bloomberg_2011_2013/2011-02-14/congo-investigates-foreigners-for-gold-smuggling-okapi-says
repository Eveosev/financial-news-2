Democratic Republic of Congoâ€™s
attorney general is investigating seven foreign nationals
accused of smuggling gold, United Nations-sponsored Radio Okapi
reported today, citing Justice Minister Luzolo Bambi.  The suspected smugglers are citizens of the U.S.,  Nigeria 
and  France , Bambi told the Kinshasa-based broadcaster today.  On Feb. 7, the governor of North Kivu province said eight
people were arrested for mineral trafficking at the airport in
Goma, the provincial capital, including four passengers and four
crew members of a U.S.-registered jet. Authorities seized more
than $6 million in cash and 400 kilograms (14,109 ounces) of
gold and impounded the plane, which flew in from  Nigeria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
