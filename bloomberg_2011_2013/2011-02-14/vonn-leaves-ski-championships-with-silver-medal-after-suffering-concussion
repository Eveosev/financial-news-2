  Lindsey Vonn  is pulling out of the
 Alpine World Ski Championships  following a runner-up finish in
the downhill 10 days after suffering a concussion.  Vonn, 26, the 2010 Olympic downhill champion, said in a
 Facebook post  that her plan coming into the championships in
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, was to compete in all of the
events despite injuring her head during a Feb. 2 training run in
Austria.  “I’ve decided to pull out of all the remaining events here
in Garmisch,” the American said. “My plan now will be to take
some time off and try to get 100 percent healthy again. My hope
is that I will be healthy and fresh when the World Cup tour
resumes at the end of the month in Are,  Sweden .”  Austria’s Elisabeth Goergl yesterday won her second gold
medal of the championships, taking the downhill by 0.44 seconds
over Vonn.  Vonn was seventh in the super-G and pulled out after the
downhill portion of the super-combined. The championships run
until Feb. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
