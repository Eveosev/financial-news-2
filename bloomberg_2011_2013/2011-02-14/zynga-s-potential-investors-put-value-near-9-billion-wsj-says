Zynga Inc. is holding talks with
potential investors about a new round of funding that may value
the company between $7 billion and $9 billion, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions.  Zynga may be looking to raise $250 million, the newspaper
said, citing the sources. The company last April filed an
authorization for new shares that then valued the company at
about $4 billion, the Journal said.    Zynga declined comment, the Journal said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
