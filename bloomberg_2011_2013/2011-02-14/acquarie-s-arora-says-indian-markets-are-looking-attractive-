Rakesh Arora, head of research at
Macquarie Capital Securities   India ) Pvt., comments on the
outlook for the nation’s stocks. He spoke in an interview in
Mumbai today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 473.59, or 2.7 percent, to 18,202.20, its steepest climb
since May 10, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai.  “Valuations are looking much cheaper and attractive. We
are into a consolidation phase. I see markets consolidating here
and taking a direction post budget.  Inflation, which was one of the big factors for this market
to correct, seems to be stabilizing. Secondly, the chance of a
sharp oil price shock has receded a bit given that the Egyptian
turmoil has faded away.”  “Global recovery is the theme we would like to play in.
Material,  information technology , pharmaceuticals are the key
sectors.”  “Post this correction and consolidations phase, India’s
growth will come back in focus and the investment cycle will
pick up.”  Arora expects the Sensex to climb to 22,000 by March 2012
and has added Reliance Industries Ltd., India’s most valuable
company, in place of Power Finance Corp. in his list of top ten
stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
