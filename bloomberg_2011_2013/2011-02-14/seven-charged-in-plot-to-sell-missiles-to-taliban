Seven people, including two American
citizens, were charged by the U.S. with plotting to smuggle
drugs and sell missiles to the Taliban in  Afghanistan .  Some of the defendants, working with unidentified sources
for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, agreed to receive
and transport tons of Taliban-owned heroin through West Africa,
the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan said today in a
statement. Some of the heroin was to be smuggled into the U.S.
and sold, according to the statement.  Three defendants also agreed to sell to the Taliban
surface-to-air missiles to protect heroin laboratories in
Afghanistan, prosecutors said. The conspiracy began last year
and included videotaped meetings over several months in Benin,  Ghana , Ukraine and Romania, they said.  “The defendants charged today, including two U.S.
citizens, were prepared to provide millions of dollars in
dangerous narcotics and lethal weapons to men they believed
represented the Taliban,” U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
