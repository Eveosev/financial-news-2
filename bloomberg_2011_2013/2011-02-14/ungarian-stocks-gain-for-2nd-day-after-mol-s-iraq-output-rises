Hungarian shares advanced for a
second day after Mol Nyrt., the country’s largest oil refiner,
reported an improvement in output at an oil well in  Iraq .  The benchmark BUX Index of shares rose 0.8 percent to
22,551.97, led by Mol, which advanced 3.1 percent to 22,300
forint, the stock’s biggest one-day gain since Dec. 22. The
refiner has a more-than 30 percent weighting in the BUX.  Output from Mol’s Shaikan-3 Shallow Appraisal Well in the
Kurdistan region of Iraq was 9,800 barrels of oil per day, a 30
percent improvement compared with its Shaikan-1 well, the
company said in a statement posted on the website of the
Budapest bourse today. The achievement stemmed from removal of
formation plugging around the well bore, a procedure which will
now also be performed on Shaikan-1, Mol said.  “We can certainly assess” Mol’s “announcement as
positive,” Equilor Befektetesi Zrt. analysts led by Akos Kuti
wrote in a note today.  Emerging market stocks rallied the most in a month today
and commodities gained following  China ’s bigger-than-forecast
growth in exports and  Egypt ’s plan to hand power to a
democratically elected government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
