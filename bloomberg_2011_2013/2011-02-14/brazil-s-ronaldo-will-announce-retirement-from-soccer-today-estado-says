Ronaldo, the scorer of a record 15
goals at soccer’s  World Cup , will quit the sport today, O Estado
de S. Paulo  reported , citing an interview with the Brazilian
striker.  The 34-year-old, FIFA’s World Player of the Year in 1996,
1997 and 2002, brought forward his retirement from the end of
the 2011 season, when his contract with Brazilian club
Corinthians ends, the newspaper said. He’ll hold a press
conference today in Sao Paulo, the club said on its  website .  “I can’t take it anymore,” the newspaper cited Ronaldo as
saying. “I wanted to carry on but I can’t. I think a play but I
can’t execute it as I want to. The time is up.”  Ronaldo’s 18-year playing career began in 1993 and was
mostly spent in  Europe  with  PSV Eindhoven , Barcelona, Inter
Milan, Real Madrid and AC Milan. He joined Corinthians at the
end of 2008 while recovering from a third knee operation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
