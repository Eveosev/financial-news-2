The pound strengthened against the
euro before reports this week that may show inflation is
gathering pace, reinforcing speculation that the  Bank of England 
will raise  interest rates  this year to curb price growth.  Sterling appreciated against 10 of its 16 most-actively
traded peers, and was little changed against the dollar.
Consumer prices rose 4 percent from a year earlier last month,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists, after gaining 3.7
percent in December, equal to the fastest pace since November
2008. The  Office for National Statistics  in London releases the
inflation data tomorrow, while the central bank publishes its
quarterly inflation report the following day.  “The pound remains resilient because the market is fearful
of rate hikes coming sooner rather than later as a result of
inflationary pressures,” said Adam McCormack, head of gilt
sales at Barclays Plc in  London .  The pound strengthened as much as 0.8 percent to 83.99
pence per euro, its strongest intraday level since Feb. 7,
before trading at 84.14 pence at 4:53 p.m. in London. Sterling
was little changed at $1.6018.  Britain’s currency gained 2.5 percent against the dollar
this year and 1.9 percent versus the euro as speculation
intensified that the central bank will need to raise borrowing
costs for the first time since July 2007 to curb inflation.  Consumer price growth has exceeded the central bank’s 2
percent limit for more than a year, and above 3 percent since
December 2009.  Record Low  Short-sterling futures were little changed, with the
implied yield on the contract expiring in December falling one
basis point to 1.70 percent, four basis points from an eight-
month high reached on Feb. 10. A lower yield indicates investors
reduced bets that policy makers will increase borrowing costs.  Policy makers left their key rate at a record low 0.5
percent last week and maintained the central bank’s bond-
purchase plan at 200 billion pounds ($320 billion). The bank’s
decision was based on new quarterly economic forecasts, which
will be presented by Governor  Mervyn King  on Feb. 16.  Business Secretary Vince Cable said he shares the view of
the “doves” on the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee, saying a rate increase would be “potentially very
difficult” in the U.K.’s current economic climate, according to
a Bloomberg Television interview airing today.  The yield on the 10-year gilt fell three basis points to
3.84 percent. The 4.75 percent security due March 2020 rose
0.235, or 2.35 pounds per 1,000 pound face amount to 106.92.
Two-year gilt yields dropped four basis points to 1.52 percent.  The U.K. 10-year breakeven rate, an indication of
investors’ inflation expectations over the life of the
securities, derived from the yield gap between conventional and
index-linked bonds, was little changed at 3.23 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
