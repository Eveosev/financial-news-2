Drugmakers in  Turkey  lost about $3.5
billion in sales in 2010 after the government cut prices as much
as 50 percent in successive reductions,  Hurriyet  said, citing
Engin Guner, vice chairman of the country’s original drugmakers
association.  Price reductions also led to about 2,000 job losses in the
25,000-strong drug employment market in Turkey, said Guner, of
the Istanbul-based Research-based Pharmaceutical Cos., according
to the newspaper.  Turkish government cut the price of original drugs by as
much as 30 percent in total in December 2009 and November 2010
as it tried to reduce health spending to 14.96 billion liras
($9.4 billion) in 2011 from 15.2 billion last year, according to
the government’s budget targets, said Guldem Berkman, chief
executive of  Novartis AG ’s Turkish unit, on Jan. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
