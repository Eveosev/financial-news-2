Clearing houses for derivatives can
help reduce risk to the financial system, Federal Reserve
Governor Daniel Tarullo said in written remarks prepared for
House Financial Services Committee testimony tomorrow.  “If properly designed, managed, and overseen, central
counterparties offer an important tool for managing counterparty
credit risk, and thus they can reduce risk to market
participants and to the financial system,” Tarullo said.  The House committee, chaired by Alabama Republican Spencer Bachus, called the hearing to assess the “regulatory, economic
and market implications” of the derivative regulations of the
Dodd-Frank Act, which overhauls supervision of the financial
system. Tarullo will testify with Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman  Mary Schapiro  and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission Chairman  Gary Gensler .  To contact the reporters on this story:
