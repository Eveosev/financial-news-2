  Vietnam ’s dong slid to a record low
against the  U.S. dollar  after the central bank last week
devalued the currency by the most since at least 1993.  The dong dropped to 20,900 per dollar as of the close at 4
p.m. in  Hanoi , compared with 20,875 at the end of last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of
Vietnam fixed the daily reference rate for today’s trading 0.1
percent weaker at 20,713, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  The central bank devalued the dong by about 7 percent on
Feb. 11, by setting the  reference rate  at 20,693 versus 18,932
the previous day. The monetary authority also narrowed the
trading band on either side of the rate from 3 percent.  “The devaluation and rising demand for dollars from
companies that need foreign exchange to pay imports added
pressure on the dong to drop today,” said Lai Tat Ha, head of
currency trading at Hanoi-based Vietnam Technological &
Commercial Joint-Stock Bank.  The currency tumbled in the so-called black market, trading
at about 21,700 as of 4 p.m. local time at gold shops in Hanoi,
compared with 21,550 on Feb. 11, according to a telephone
directory information service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts &
Telecommunications.  The central bank said the weaker  exchange rate  and narrowed
trading band will help curb the country’s trade deficit. Vietnam
posted a $1 billion trade shortfall in January, according to
preliminary government figures.  Government benchmark bonds gained.  The yield on the five-year note declined to a five-day low
of 11.47 percent, from 11.52 on Feb. 11, according to a daily
fixing price from about 10 banks compiled by Bloomberg.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
