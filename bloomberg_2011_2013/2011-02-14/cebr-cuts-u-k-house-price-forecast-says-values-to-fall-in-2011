The outlook for the U.K. housing
market has become more gloomy in recent months, according to the
Centre for Economics and Business Research, which revised its
forecast to say prices will decline this year.  Home values will drop 1.7 percent in 2011 to an average
175,416 pounds ($280,578), compared with a November forecast for
a gain of 2.2 percent, the London-based group said in an e-
mailed report today. It cut its prediction for gains through
2014 to 9.1 percent from 16 percent.  Data last week showed home values fell for a fourth month
in January, and former  Bank of England  policy maker  Kate Barker 
said on Feb. 11 prices may extend declines this year as Britons’
confidence weakens and banks restrict mortgage lending. The CEBR
said rising unemployment and “anemic growth” in household
incomes will curtail demand for property this year.  “We expect  house prices  to grow tentatively over the
coming years, given that household incomes are being squeezed
and banks are still wary of lending,” CEBR Chief Executive
Officer Douglas McWilliams said in a statement. “There is
currently significant uncertainty in the market caused by the
government’s spending cuts and a choppy recovery, which has
greatly impacted transaction levels.”  The CEBR said values will rise at a “slow pace” from 2012
onward as banks relax lending criteria and consumer confidence
recovers.  The Bank of England kept its bond-purchase plan unchanged
at 200 billion pounds and its benchmark interest rate at a
record low of 0.5 percent last week after the economy
unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Scott Hamilton  in London at
