One of 16 turbines at  Venezuela ’s
largest hydroelectric dam, El Guri, was shut down over the
weekend, bringing to six the number of turbines now out of
commission, El Universal  reported , citing Igor Gaviria,
president of the state-run electricity company, Electrificacion
del Caroni.  The shutdown was part of a “scheduled” operation and the
turbine, which generates 630 megawatts, will start up again
tonight, El Universal quoted Gaviria as saying.  Gaviria said the turbine’s temporary shutdown at El Guri,
which supplies more than two-thirds of the country’s power,
won’t lead to any need for rationing, as occurred last year
during Venezuela’s electricity crisis.  Calls by Bloomberg News to the Ministry of Electricity went
unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
