  Bharti Airtel Ltd .’s application to
delist the shares of its Zambian unit from the Lusaka Stock
Exchange was rejected, the bourse said.  The shares must immediately resume trading, Friday Ndhlovu,
chairman of the country’s bourse, said in a statement published
in the Lusaka-based Times of Zambia today. The company didn’t
follow the correct procedure in trying to leave the exchange and
the application “lacked merit,” he said.  Bharti, based in  New Delhi , can reapply to delist and must
take into account the interests of minority shareholders who
didn’t to sell their shares, Ndhlovu said.  About 2,000 shareholders, owning 3 percent of Celtel Zambia
Ltd., rejected an offer of 710 kwacha a share ($0.15) from
Bharti Airtel, Beatrice Nkanza, general manager of the exchange
bourse said on Dec. 30. Bharti announced on Dec. 24 it planned
to delist from the exchange after increasing its stake to 97
percent from 78.9 percent. Trading in the shares was suspended
on Aug. 18 after Bharti bought Zain’s African assets.  According to Zambian regulations, any company that has more
than 50 shareholders must be quoted on the exchange, Nkanza
said.  Lisa Mulozi, a spokeswoman for the company in Lusaka,
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News by phone
today.  Bharti Airtel’s unit is the biggest mobile-phone operator
in the southern African country, with about 70 percent of the
market. It is one of 22 shares traded on the Zambian bourse,
according to the exchange’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
