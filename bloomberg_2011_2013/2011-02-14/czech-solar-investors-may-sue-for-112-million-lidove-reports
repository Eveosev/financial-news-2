The Czech government may face claims
by foreign investors in solar power plants totaling as much as 2
billion koruna ($112 million),  Lidove Noviny  reported, without
citing anyone.  Law office NH Partners is preparing an arbitration lawsuit
for about 10 companies that claim a cut in feed-in tariffs and a
new tax on solar energy have reduced the value of their
investments, the newspaper said, citing Lukas Nyvlt, a partner
at NH Partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
