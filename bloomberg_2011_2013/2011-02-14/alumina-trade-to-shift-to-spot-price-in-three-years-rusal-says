Alumina, used to make aluminum, will
be traded mostly in the cash market within three years not long-
term contracts, adding to price gains for the material, the
world’s largest maker of the lightweight metal said.  The move to a producer-set spot index, which makes the
price less dependent on aluminum, will push alumina to $450 a
metric ton this year from about $390, United Co. Rusal Deputy
Chief Executive Officer Oleg Mukhamedshin said today.  “Long-term alumina contracts are gradually expiring and we
expect that in two to three years most of the sales will be
based on the index price rather than the long-term contracts,”
Mukhamedshin said on a conference call. “This news is pushing
the alumina price up.”  Alumina’s price would increase at a faster rate than Rusal
forecasts for the lightweight metal. Rusal expects aluminum to
“sustain above $2,500” this year, the company said today in a
statement. Last year, aluminum averaged $2,199 a ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
