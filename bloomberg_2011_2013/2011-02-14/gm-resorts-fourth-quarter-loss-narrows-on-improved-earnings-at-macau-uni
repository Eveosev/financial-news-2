  MGM Resorts International , the
biggest casino operator on the Las Vegas Strip, reported a
narrower fourth-quarter net loss as performance improved in
Macau, while  Las Vegas  results trailed analysts’ estimates.  The loss of $139.2 million, or 29 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $433.9 million, or 98 cents, a year earlier, the
company said today in a statement. Excluding items such as tax
adjustments, the loss was 20 cents, smaller than the average 22-
cent loss estimated by 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Las Vegas Strip  cash flow , excluding MGM’s CityCenter joint
venture, fell 4 percent to $217 million. Las Vegas is seeing an
uneven recovery from a record two-year slump in gambling and
conventions. Industrywide casino revenue on the Strip fell in
November and December, while rising 4.1 percent for all of 2010.  “The recovery that has been long awaited and frustrating
in its timing is gaining momentum,” MGM Chief Executive Officer
Jim Murren said in a telephone interview. This year “we’ve had
a consistently strong quarter so far on the convention side,
with very good customer spend around events.”  MGM dropped 47 cents, or 3 percent, to $15.07 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 1.5 percent this year.  Cash Flow Estimates  Fourth-quarter revenue rose 1 percent to $1.47 billion,
from $1.45 billion a year earlier, less than analyst projections
for $1.5 billion. Cash flow at wholly owned casinos, measured as
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, fell 5.1 percent to $266.7 million.  Steven Kent of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and  David Katz  at
Jefferies & Co. were among analysts expecting a rise.  Convention bookings will account for about 14 percent of
MGM’s Las Vegas room nights this year, up from 12.7 percent in
2010, Murren said in the interview. Revpar, a measure of room
rates and occupancy, will rise at least 10 percent in the first
quarter, boosted by resort fees and increased meeting business.  Total operating income from MGM’s Macau joint venture was
$119 million, up from $22 million a year earlier, MGM said. The
company plans a Hong Kong initial public offering of its joint
venture in the world’s biggest casino market, where overall
gambling revenue surged 58 percent last year. The MGM Grand
Macau repaid MGM $192 million in the quarter.  Cash flow at the $8.5 billion CityCenter joint venture of
hotels, condominiums, a casino and mall on the  Las Vegas Strip 
was $36 million in the fourth quarter, on revenue of $257
million.  MGM and partner Dubai World opened CityCenter in December
2009 after the project skirted bankruptcy. The partners replaced
most of the property’s $1.8 billion loan with bonds with later
maturities last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
