The  European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development  said it will support Serbian agribusinesses with
a 20 million-euro ($27 million) loan, promoting warehouse
receipt financing.  Together with the local  unit  of  Credit Agricole SA , the
EBRD will disburse the funds as part of its broader, 70 million-
euro program, started last summer, to “finance the seasonal
working capital needs” of Serbian agriculture producers, the
bank said in an e-mailed statement.  Warehouse receipts serve as collateral, allowing farmers to
take a loan against their produce and “thus alleviate crucial
access to funding” for viable enterprises, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
