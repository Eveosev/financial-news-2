Malawi’s security forces blocked a
demonstration against fuel shortages today and arrested
organizers of the protest.  Mavuto Bamusi, the national coordinator for the Human
Rights Consultative Committee, was among those detained, Deputy
Commissioner of Police Innocent Botomani told reporters in the
capital, Lilongwe.  “We will not allow the demonstrations to go on because
organizers of the protests did not get permission from Lilongwe
City Council,” said Botomani.  Malawi has suffered recurrent fuel shortages because the
country doesn’t have enough foreign exchange to pay suppliers,
Finance Minister Ken Kandodo said on Feb. 10. Fuel importers are
demanding cash payments because Petroleum Importers Ltd. hasn’t
repaid all debts from deliveries made on credit, Grain Malunga,
the minister of energy, said on Capital Radio on the same day.  “The situation is pathetic,” Kandodo said in Parliament
in Lilongwe. “We have inconvenienced the public and the economy
is affected.”  Still, Lilongwe City Council chief executive officer,
Kelvin M’mangisa, told the Nation newspaper today there was no
need for people to demonstrate as fuel was now available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
