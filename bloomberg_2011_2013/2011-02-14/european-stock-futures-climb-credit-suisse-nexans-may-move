European stocks rose to their
highest level since September 2008 as a smaller-than-estimated
contraction in Japan’s economy spurred speculation that the
global recovery will continue.    John Wood Group Plc  soared 14 percent as General Electric
Co. agreed to buy its well-support division for $2.8 billion.  Credit Suisse Group AG  added 1.9 percent after Switzerland’s
second-biggest bank agreed to sell 6 billion Swiss francs ($6.19
billion) of contingent convertible bonds to shareholders in  Qatar  and  Saudi Arabia .  The Stoxx 600 advanced 0.4 percent to 289.11 at the 4:30
p.m. close in London. The measure has gained 83 percent from the
12-year low that it reached in March 2009 as investors bet the
strengthening global economic recovery will help corporate
profits. The rally has pushed the measure to about 16 times the
reported earnings of its companies, near the highest level in
nine months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The reporting season continues its positive trend,” said  Ian Richards , an equity strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in  London . “Macro momentum underpins this. We
continue to believe that earnings surprises and valuation re-
ratings will drive equities throughout 2011.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in 11 of the 18 western
European markets today.  Germany ’s DAX Index gained 0.3 percent,
while France’s CAC 40 Index and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index both
lost 0.1 percent.  Even though Japan’s economy shrank for the first time in
five quarters, the 1.1 percent contraction beat economists’
estimates for gross domestic product to drop 2 percent. Japan’s
Cabinet Office said gross domestic product fell because of
slowing exports and fading government stimulus programs.  Dissolved Parliament  European stocks recovered their losses on Feb. 11 as
Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  stepped down and handed power
to the military, bowing to the demands of protesters who have
occupied Tahrir Square in central Cairo for the past few weeks.  Egypt’s Supreme Council of the Armed Forces yesterday
dissolved parliament, suspended the constitution and said it
will rule until elections take place. The council also formed a
committee to introduce constitutional changes, according to a
statement read on state television.  Wood Group climbed 14 percent to 652 pence, the highest
price since the company’s initial public offering in 2002. Wood
Group will return at least $1.7 billion in cash to shareholders
and use the rest of the sale proceeds to reduce debt after
buying PSN Ltd., a brownfield-services provider, in December.
The company has no plans to divest further parts of the
business, said Chief Executive Officer Allister Langlands.  Credit Suisse, Meda  Credit Suisse climbed 1.9 percent to 42.40 Swiss francs
after saying that it will sell 6 billion francs of so-called
CoCos to investors Qatar Holding LLC and The Olayan Group.
Credit Suisse will issue the bonds in exchange for cash or Tier
1 capital notes that Credit Suisse sold to the two Arab
investors in 2008.    Meda AB  surged 14 percent to 56.90 kronor after the
drugmaker reported higher-than-estimated earnings and doubled
its dividend. The company’s fourth-quarter net income dropped to
184 million kronor ($28.3 million), beating the 129.3 million
kronor forecast by the average of eight estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Meda will pay a dividend of 2 kronor a share,
compared with 1 krona a year earlier.  Strong Dollar    Hochtief AG  gained 3.1 percent to 68.43 euros as the German
company that controls  Australia ’s biggest builder Leighton
Holdings Ltd. predicted that profit for the 2010 fiscal year
will be “well above” a year earlier because of strength in
nearly all its divisions and the strong Australian dollar.    Carrefour SA , the world’s second-largest retailer by sales,
advanced 1.1 percent to 35.77 euros as JPMorgan Chase & Co.
added the shares to its analyst focus list.    Andritz AG , the Austrian machinery maker, surged 3.2
percent to 65.30 euros. The company said it is in advanced talks
to supply technology to the Punta Pereira pulp mill in  Uruguay ,
in what would be its biggest ever order. Technology orders for
similar projects cost at least 750 million euros ($1.01
billion), Andritz said.    Nexans SA  jumped 3.9 percent to 68.02 euros after the
world’s largest cable maker posted 2010 net income of 82 million
euros, compared with 2009 profit of 8 million euros.    Nokia Oyj , the world’s biggest maker of mobile phones, sank
5.3 percent to 6.63 euros, extending the previous day’s 14
percent slump. Analysts at banks from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to
HSBC Holdings Plc and Swedbank AB recommended selling the shares
after Nokia failed to forecast earnings from its partnership
with Microsoft Corp.  BASF SE gained 2.5 percent to 59.49 euros. The world’s
biggest chemical company climbed after Citigroup Inc. named BASF
among its most preferred shares.  ARM Holdings Plc advanced 6.6 percent to 651 pence, the
highest price in a decade. The company which designs
superconductors that power Apple Inc.’s iPhone rose after Morgan
Stanley said shipments of tablet computers may jump sixfold by
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
