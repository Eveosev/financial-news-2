T. Boone Pickens, the billionaire
Texas hedge-fund manager, bought new stakes in  EOG Resources
Inc ., a natural gas and oil explorer which is selling assets,
and  Dynegy Inc ., the U.S. power producer that is the target of a
$655 million takeover bid.  Pickens’s BP Capital Management LP bought $16.5 million
worth of Houston-based EOG Resources’ shares in the three months
ended Dec. 31, according to a public filing. BP Capital, based
in Dallas, also purchased $7.8 million worth of shares of
Dynegy, subject to a buyout offer from billionaire investor Carl Icahn.  The value of Pickens’s equity holdings fell to 1.1 percent
to $275.9 million as of Dec. 31, from $279.3 million in the
prior quarter, according to the filing.  Pickens also bought $11.3 million worth of Houston-based  National Oilwell Varco Inc ., a supplier of onshore and offshore
drilling equipment.  Pickens’s fund sold its holdings in  Schlumberger Ltd ., the
world’s largest oilfield services supplier, and offshore oil
explorers Apache Corp. and Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission within 45 days of each quarter’s end to show
their U.S.-listed stocks, options and convertible bonds. The
filings don’t show non-U.S. securities or how much cash the
firms hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
