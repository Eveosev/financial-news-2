The Australian dollar rose, snapping
a three-day decline, after a government report showed home-loan
approvals rose in December.  The currency also strengthened as a rally in Asian stocks
spurred demand for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie climbed to $1.0054 as of 1:40 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0021 last week in  New York .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
