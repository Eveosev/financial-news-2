  CBS Corp . said last night’s Grammy
Awards show attracted 26.6 million viewers, the most for the
telecast since 2001.  The 53rd annual Grammys, broadcast from the Staples Center
in  Los Angeles , drew 2.6 percent more viewers than last year’s
program, New York-based CBS said, citing data from Nielsen Co.  It’s the second straight year that the TV audience has
increased from the prior telecast. Grammy performances last
night included a first-ever by Rolling Stones lead-singer  Mick Jagger , a tribute to acoustical music featuring Bob Dylan with
Mumford & Sons and the Avett Brothers, and a collaboration of
Usher, Justin Bieber and Jaden Smith. Lady Antebellum collected
five awards and Arcade Fire won album of the year.  The show also drew a 10 rating among viewers ages 18 to 49,
a group targeted by advertisers, compared with a 9.9 rating last
year. The show also had its best rating among households and the
younger demographics since February 2004, CBS said.  CBS, owner of the most-watched  broadcast network , fell 27
cents to $21.67 at 12:39 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares had climbed 15 percent this year
before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
