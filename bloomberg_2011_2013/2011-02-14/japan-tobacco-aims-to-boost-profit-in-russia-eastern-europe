  Japan Tobacco Inc ., the world’s
third-largest publicly traded cigarette maker by volume, aims
to boost overseas profit at least 10 percent as a tax increase 
damps demand at home.  Japan Tobacco plans to increase sales in countries
including Russia, Yasushi Shingai, executive vice president of
the JT International SA unit, said in an interview on Feb. 10 in
Tokyo, where the company is based. The cigarette maker will
focus on its more profitable brands including Mild Seven and
Winston, he said.  The company is targeting profit growth in Russia even as
the country seeks to crack down on smoking through an
advertising ban and higher taxes. Eastern Europe including
Russia is the biggest overseas market for Japan Tobacco,
accounting for 48 percent of its international unit’s sales
volume in 2010, the company said Feb. 7.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, for Japan Tobacco’s international
business rose 7.7 percent in dollar terms, based on constant
rates of exchange, last year after gaining 15 percent in 2009,
Japan Tobacco said last week.  The company had a 37 percent market share in  Russia . Japan
Tobacco also aims to expand sales in the Middle East and North
Africa, Shingai said.  Japan Tobacco rose 0.5 percent to 335,000 yen at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo trading. The stock has advanced 11.5 percent this
year, compared with a 4.9 percent gain in Japan’s benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Domestic Sales  Net income for the year ending March may decline 1.8
percent to 136 billion yen ($1.6 billion), Japan Tobacco said
Feb. 7. The company expects domestic cigarette sales in the 12-
month period will fall 12 percent after a tax increase in
October pushed up prices. The average price of 20 cigarettes
rose 37 percent to 410 yen on Oct. 1, according to the Tokyo-
based Tobacco Institute of Japan.  The cigarette maker bought RJR Nabisco Inc.’s international
businesses, including the Camel and Winston  brands , in 1999 and
the U.K.’s Gallaher Group in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
