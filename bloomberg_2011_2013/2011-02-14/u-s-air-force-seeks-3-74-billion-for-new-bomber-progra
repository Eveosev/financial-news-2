The U.S.  Air Force  is requesting
$3.74 billion in its five-year budget for research and
development of a new class of long-range strike systems that may
include a new bomber, missiles and drones.  The Air Force is seeking an initial $197 million in fiscal
2012, which begins Oct. 1, to begin developing a new bomber, the
military service said in an e-mail. Nearly three-fourths of the
total funding will be spent in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, with
the goal of “strike capability across the spectrum of conflict
in the 2020-2030 timeframe,” it said.  The development of a new bomber will be the first such
aircraft in almost three decades since  Northrop Grumman Corp .’s
B-2 was designed.  Lockheed Martin Corp . and  Boeing Co . said in
2008 they would form a partnership to compete against Northrop.  The new “bomber will be long-range nuclear capable, able
to penetrate hostile airspace, and have the option of being
piloted remotely,” according to a Pentagon document
accompanying the 2012 budget released today.  General Norton Schwartz, chief of staff for the Air Force,
has said it will develop the new bomber fleet while continuing
to use the Pentagon’s B-2, B-1, and B-52 bombers.  ‘Optionally Manned Planes’  As a first step toward a new family of bombers, the U.S.
ought to develop a fleet of at least 100 “optionally manned
planes” that can carry a payload of 20,000 pounds (9,072
kilograms) and fly as far as 5,000 nautical miles, Mark
Gunzinger, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments, an independent Washington-based defense research
group, wrote in a report last year.  Such a plane may cost as much as $500 million each and take
about 15 years to develop, according to Gunzinger, the author of
the study “Sustaining America’s Strategic Advantage in Long-
Range Strike,” which was published in September.  Gunzinger said that plane should be supplemented by an
unmanned bomber that can fly off of U.S. aircraft carriers and
go 1,500 nautical miles; a long-range cruise missile; non-
nuclear ballistic missiles that can strike targets within hours;
and planes that can disable enemy radar.  These elements would be a new “family of systems” that
enables the U.S. military to strike targets deep in countries
like Iran and  China , Gunzinger said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
