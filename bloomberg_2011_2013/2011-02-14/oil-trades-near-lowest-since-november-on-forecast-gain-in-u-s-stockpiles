Oil traded near the lowest since
November in  New York  after analysts forecast crude stockpiles in
the U.S. will increase for a fifth week and as tensions eased in  Egypt  after the ouster last week of President  Hosni Mubarak .  Futures slipped to the lowest in almost 11 weeks yesterday
after the Egyptian army dissolved parliament and suspended the
constitution to meet opposition demands. An Energy Department
report tomorrow may show crude inventories rose 2.5 million
barrels last week from 345.1 million barrels, according to the
median of 10 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  “There’s a considerable fundamental overhang in this
market, and as the geopolitical premium bleeds out, it’s going
to be difficult for the market to maintain these levels,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based
hedge fund that focuses on energy. Oil below $85.11 is “back in
the congestion zone from October and November of last year.”  Crude for March delivery was at $84.95 a barrel, up 14
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 10:34 a.m. Sydney time. The contract slipped 77 cents to
$84.81 yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 30. Prices are 15
percent higher in the past year.  The Egyptian army, which assumed power after Mubarak’s
ouster Feb. 11, told protesters it will respond to their demands
by the end of the week, Ahmed Maher, a co-founder of the Six of
April opposition group said yesterday. His organization is part
of the Revolution’s Youth Coalition, the group that helped
orchestrate the street protests that started Jan. 25.    Brent crude  for April settlement gained $2.14, or 2.1
percent, to $103.08 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange yesterday, the highest since Sept. 26, 2008. The
March contract expired on Feb. 11 at $101.43.  To contact the reporters on this story:
