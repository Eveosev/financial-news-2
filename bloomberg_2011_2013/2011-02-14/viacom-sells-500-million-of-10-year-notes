  Viacom Inc ., owner of  MTV Networks 
and  Paramount Pictures , sold $500 million of 10-year notes,
according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The notes pay 110 basis points more than similar-maturity
U.S. Treasuries, said the person, who declined to be identified
because of lack of authorization to speak publicly. A basis
point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
