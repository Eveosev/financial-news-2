Croatian tourist arrivals rose an
annual 0.4 percent in December to 147,927, the Zagreb-based
 statistics office  said today in a statement on its website.  Tourism, which accounts for about 20 percent of gross
domestic product in the Adriatic Sea nation, is vital for the
government to narrow its budget gap, forecast at 4.2 percent for
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
