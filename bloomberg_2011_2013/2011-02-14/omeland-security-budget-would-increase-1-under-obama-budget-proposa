President  Barack Obama  proposed less
than a 1 percent increase in spending by the Department of  Homeland Security  for the next fiscal year, with the emphasis on
money for more Border Patrol agents, customs officers and body
scanners.  Under Obama’s proposal, the department would receive $43.2
billion for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, compared with
$42.9 billion for the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 2010,
the last year in which Congress enacted a 12-month spending
plan. The government has been operating since then with interim
spending.  The 2012 proposal includes money for 21,370 Border Patrol
agents and 300 new Customs and Border Protection officers for
cargo and passenger screening. The department would get an
additional 275 airport screening machines that use advanced
imagery technology, devices that civil liberties groups have
said violate privacy.  The department’s budget, part of the government’s national
security spending, has largely been shielded from proposed cuts
in the debate over the ballooning federal deficit. Still, the
budget would trim $450 million for consulting contracts, travel,
printing and supplies.  The administration proposed deploying 1,275 body scanners
in airports by the end of 2012, with $273 million for explosives
detectors.  L-3 Communications Holdings Inc . and  OSI Systems
Inc .’s Rapiscan make the body scanners for U.S. airports.  Spending on the Coast Guard would rise to $8.7 billion from
$8.6 billion in 2010, with $358 million to construct six fast-
response cutters and $130 million to build two patrol aircraft.
The request comes in the aftermath of the Coast Guard’s response
to the Deepwater Horizon explosion in the  Gulf of Mexico .  Obama also would provide $459 million for the department’s
cyber-security unit.  Obama would more than double the airline security fee to
$5.50 per flight in 2014 from $2.50 now. With the increase,
which  would raise $587 million in 2012 and $2.4 billion in
2014, the fees would account for 80 percent of aviation security
spending, up from 41 percent.  Airlines have opposed such increases in the past, and their
allies in Congress have defeated those proposed by the Bush and
Obama administrations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
