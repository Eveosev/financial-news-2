Copper climbed for a third day in  London  as China’s imports unexpectedly climbed, boosting
consumption prospects in the world’s largest metals user. Tin
advanced to an all-time high.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange gained as
much as 0.9 percent to $10,047 a metric ton and was at
$10,046.75 at 2:50 p.m. in Singapore. The metal extended gains
after data showed China’s January exports increased 38 percent,
higher than all 22 economists’ forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey and compared with the median estimate of 23 percent.  Copper also rose as Japan’s economy shrank 1.1 percent in
the fourth quarter, less than the 2 percent drop that economists
were expecting, adding to signs economic recovery outside  China 
is gathering pace.  “Economic data on the whole seems to be improving and this
helps lift the mood in the market as well,” Pan Jinghua, an
analyst at Citic Futures Co., said from  Shanghai .  May-delivery metal on the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained
as much as 1 percent to 76,250 yuan ($11,560) a ton, before
trading at 76,100 yuan. Futures in  New York  climbed by as much
as 1 percent to $4.583 a pound and last traded at $4.5805.  China imported 364,240 tons of copper and its products in
January, compared with 344,560 tons in December and 292,100 tons
in January 2010. A rise in Chinese January copper imports would
be surprising and, more importantly for metal traders, bullish,
Citigroup Inc. analysts including  David Thurtell  said Feb. 7.  “There was very little stockpiling activity among
fabricators at the end of last year, however inventories on hand
have practically been depleted,” Liang Lijuan, an analyst at
Cofco Futures Co., said from Beijing. “As they ramp up
production after the Lunar New Year, they don’t have much choice
except to re-stock.”  High Prices  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest mining company,
forecast that high copper prices will continue amid rising
demand and before output from new projects eases a supply
shortfall. The International Copper Study Group predicts a
435,000-ton deficit this year.  “We will see a continued period of strong copper pricing,
largely because many of the large mines, including our own, are
seeing declining grades, deepening pits,” Tom Albanese, chief
executive officer of London-based  Rio Tinto , told Australian
Broadcasting Corp.’s “Inside Business” television program.  Copper, which reached a record $10,160 a ton on Feb. 7,
fell for the first week in three last week after China increased
borrowing costs for the third time in four months, adding to
tightening measures that also include raising the amount of
deposits banks must hold in reserve.  Tin in London climbed 0.2 percent to a record $31,850.
Aluminum rose 1 percent to $2,519 a ton, zinc gained 0.7 percent
to $2,481.50 a ton, lead increased 1.5 percent to $2,597 a ton
and nickel climbed 1 percent to $28,575 ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
