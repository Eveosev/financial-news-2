Jana Partners LLC bought gold worth
$122.3 million last quarter, joining hedge funds including John
Paulson’s Paulson & Co. in betting the metal will continue to
gain in value.  Jana, which is based in New York, acquired 881,844 shares
in the SPDR Gold Trust fund, making it the hedge fund’s third-
biggest U.S.-listed holding, according to a regulatory filing
today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Jana also
bought a $130.1 million stake in Detroit-based  General Motors
Co ., its second-largest position by market value, and a $109.6
million stake in San Francisco-based Visa Inc.  Today’s filing shows Jana sold its stakes in Microsoft
Corp., the world’s largest software company,  RadioShack Corp .
and  Hertz Global Holdings Inc .  The SEC requires money managers who oversee more than $100
million in U.S. equities to report their holdings on a Form 13F
within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The filing must
include all holdings in stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges, as
well as options and convertible debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
