Deutsche Bank AG is less likely to
offer Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  a senior appointment
following his surprise announcement last week that he would be
leaving his post early and was not seeking to become president
of the  European Central Bank , the Financial Times reported,
citing people close to the situation. Bank directors are
disturbed by the way Weber handled his departure from Germany’s
central bank and by the reaction in the country to the idea of
his making a transition to Deutsche, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
