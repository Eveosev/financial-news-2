Japan’s 10 regional utilities used
49 percent more  fuel oil  at thermal power plants in January
compared with a year earlier as colder weather increased demand
for heating.  The utilities, led by Tokyo Electric Power Co., consumed
748,606 kiloliters of fuel oil in January, up from 502,220
kiloliters a year earlier, according to data released by  the
Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan  today.  Power generation by the utilities rose 5.8 percent to 92.3
billion kilowatt-hours as lower temperatures increased power
demand for heating, the group said in the report. That’s a
record for January. Thermal power generation rose 17 percent,
while nuclear power output fell 10 percent, the federation said.  The country recorded the coldest average temperatures for
January since 1986 in its northern, eastern and western regions,
the  Japan Meteorological Agency  said on Feb. 1.  The following table shows Japanese utilities’ consumption
and intake of fuel oil, crude, liquefied natural gas and coal
for January. Fuel oil and crude volume is in kiloliters, while
LNG and coal volume is in metric tons.
