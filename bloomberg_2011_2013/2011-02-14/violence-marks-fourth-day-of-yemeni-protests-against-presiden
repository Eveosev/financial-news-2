Thousands of protesters gathered at
Yemen’s Sanaa University for a fourth day to demand President
Ali Abdullah Saleh step down, clashing with pro-government
demonstrators who hurled stones and wielded clubs.  Protesters chanted “Down, down with Ali, long live Yemen”
as police formed a human shield to keep crowds from spreading.
At least 17 people were injured and 165 detained, Xinhua news
agency reporting, citing witnesses.  Tens of thousands of Yemenis, inspired by uprisings in
Tunisia and  Egypt , have rallied in recent weeks, demanding
Saleh’s immediate resignation after 32 years in power. Saleh
said on Feb. 2 he won’t seek to extend his term when it expires
in 2013 and that his son would not succeed him as president.  Yemen’s Joint Meeting Parties, an opposition coalition, has
asked Saleh to remove his relatives from security, military and
other government posts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
