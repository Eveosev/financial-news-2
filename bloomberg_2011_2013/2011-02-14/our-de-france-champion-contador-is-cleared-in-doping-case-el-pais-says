Tour de France champion Alberto Contador was cleared of doping after failing a drug test at
July’s race, according to El Pais newspaper and other Spanish
media.  The Spanish cycling federation canceled its Jan. 26
proposal for a one-year ban after considering final arguments by
Contador’s legal team,  El Pais  reported on its website, citing
unidentified sources close to the four-person panel responsible
for making the decision.  Juan Carlos Castano, the federation president, said by
telephone that he couldn’t confirm the reports and doesn’t
expect a definitive decision until tomorrow. Contador’s lawyer
Andy Ramos and spokesman Jacinto Vidarte said they hadn’t
received notification of any decision.  Contador blames eating contaminated beef for testing
positive for the banned stimulant clenbuterol on the last rest
day of the 2010 race. The test found he had 50 picograms per
milliliter of clenbuterol in his body. A picogram is one
trillionth of a gram.  Cycling’s ruling body, the International Cycling Union or
UCI, and the  World Anti-Doping Agency  can appeal the
federation’s verdict at the Lausanne, Switzerland-based Court of
Arbitration for Sport, a process that could take months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
