  Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc .,
operator of the world’s largest fleet of  Boeing Co . 747
freighters, jumped the most since April 2009 in Nasdaq trading
after boosting its 2011 profit forecast.  Adjusted earnings for the year will exceed $5.30 a share as
shipping demand rises, the Purchase, New York-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts had predicted $5.08, the average
of nine estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Some people expected less given the fact that last year
they had a lot of benefit from military business they won’t have
this year,” said  David Campbell , a Thompson Davis & Co. analyst
in Richmond,  Virginia , who recommends buying Atlas. “The
company’s confidence that they’ll do 15 percent-plus profit
margins is probably a surprise,” he said.  Atlas Air rose $7.32, or 13 percent, to $63.77 at 4 p.m.  New York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. That was the
shares’ biggest daily percentage gain since April 21, 2009. They
have climbed 66 percent in the past 12 months.  Volumes at Atlas will increase again this year after a
record in 2010 on shipments of technology products,
pharmaceuticals and automotive parts, Chief Executive Officer
William J. Flynn said in the statement.  Atlas is leasing two Boeing 747s to meet increasing cargo
demand, Flynn said. Atlas now has 24 of the four-engine jets and
expects to put three of the new 747-8 model freighters into
service in the fourth quarter, according to the statement.  Fourth-quarter net income rose 47 percent to $41.6 million,
or $1.58 a share, from $28.3 million, or $1.17, a year earlier,
Atlas Air said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
