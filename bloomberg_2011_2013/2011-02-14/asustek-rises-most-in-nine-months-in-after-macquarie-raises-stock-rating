  Asustek Computer Inc . rose the most
in 21 months in Taipei trading after Macquarie Group Ltd. and
Credit Suisse Group AG increased their ratings on the company,
citing expectations for lower costs.  Shares of the Taipei-based computer maker surged 6.9
percent to NT$247.50 as of 11:35 a.m., set for the biggest
advance since May 4, 2009. The benchmark Taiex index gained 0.9
percent. Both brokerages increased their stock ratings to
“outperform” from “neutral.”  “We believe ongoing outsourcing strategies” will help to
lower the company’s cost structure and improve margins,
Macquarie analysts led by Andrew Chang said in a report. Credit
Suisse raised its rating because of the company’s “better cost
control” and “attractive valuation,” according to a report by
Robert Cheng and Jill Su.  Austek’s shares have declined 11 percent this year,
compared with the 3.3 percent drop in the benchmark Taiex index.
The company reported fourth-quarter net income of NT$4.02
billion ($137 million), higher than the NT$3.60 billion estimate
by 13 analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Macquarie increased its share-price estimate to NT$284 from
NT$267, while Credit Suisse raised its forecast to NT$299 from
NT$267.  To contact the reporter on this story:
