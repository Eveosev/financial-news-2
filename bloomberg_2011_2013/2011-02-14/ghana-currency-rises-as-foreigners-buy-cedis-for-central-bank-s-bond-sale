Ghana’s cedi strengthened against
the  U.S. dollar  as foreign investors sold the greenback and
bought the local currency in advance of a Feb. 16 bond sale by
the Bank of  Ghana .  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
traded at 1.5050 per dollar at 1:08 p.m. in Accra, from 1.5060
at 9 a.m. this morning, according to data from  Barclays Bank  of
Ghana Ltd.  “The impending bond sale gives the cedi a positive
outlook,” said Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the lender,
in a phone interview in Accra. “In most cases these are taken
up by offshore investors and they have to bring in U.S.
dollars.”  The bank will offer 400 million cedis ($265.2 million) of
three-year bonds at the scheduled auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
