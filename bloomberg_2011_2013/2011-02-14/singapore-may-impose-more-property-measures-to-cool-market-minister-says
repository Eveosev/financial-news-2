Singapore may take further measures
to cool the  property market  if needed following last month’s
curbs, Mah Bow Tan, the city’s minister for national development,
said in Parliament today.  The government on Jan. 13 raised down payment requirements
for second mortgages and boosted sales taxes to curb property
speculation. The measures were pre-emptive and imposed to cool
the market, not “crash it,” Mah said.  “Given the current situation of strong economic growth,
low  interest rates  and a lot of liquidity in the market, I think
it’s not unnatural to expect property prices will remain
strong,” Mah said. “We will continue to monitor the property
market closely and take further steps if necessary to promote a
stable and sustainable property market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
