  Satyam Computer Services Ltd ., the
software exporter embroiled in  India ’s biggest corporate fraud
probe, rose the most in almost five months in Mumbai trading
after the company reported a third consecutive quarterly profit.  Satyam jumped as much as 14 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Sept. 22, to 66.10 rupees. It traded at 63.90 rupees,
up 11 percent, at 11:09 a.m in Mumbai, while the benchmark
Sensex Index gained 1.7 percent.  Net income in the three months ended in December more than
doubled to 589 million rupees ($13 million) from the quarter
ended in September, the company said in a statement to the stock
exchange today. It’s the third consecutive profitable quarter
for Hyderabad-based Satyam, whose former Chairman Ramalinga Raju
disclosed in January 2009 that he overstated the company’s
assets by about $1 billion.  The company has government approval exempting it from
publishing quarterly financial data between December 2008 and
March 2010, it said in the statement. Satyam’s new owner,  Tech
Mahindra Ltd ., aims to merge the software exporter with itself.  Satyam also said S. Vasant Krishnan will replace S.
Durgashankar as chief financial officer from March 1.
Durgashankar will return to  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd ., according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on the story:
