Egyptian natural-gas exports to
Jordan halted since a Feb. 5 explosion is costing the kingdom
about 20 million dinars ($28 million) a week, a Jordanian energy
ministry spokesman said.  “Until today, the gas is still cut, and we were told that
repair works would take two weeks from the day of the
incident,” Mahmoud Al-Ees said today in a telephone interview
from Amman.  Egypt halted gas shipments after an explosion at a facility
in the Sinai during protests that led to the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak . Jordan used Egyptian gas for 80 percent of its
electricity supply over the past three years, Ghalib Maabreh,
general director of National Electric Power Co., said Feb.  “Jordan had to shift power stations to alternative fuels,
fuel oil and diesel, which is very costly,” Al-Ees said Feb. 6.  Egypt has gas reserves of 77 trillion cubic feet (2.18
trillion cubic meters) and is the main producer of the fuel in
the eastern Mediterranean, according to the U.S. Energy
Department. The country exported 650 billion cubic feet in 2009,
30 percent by either the Arab  gas pipeline  to Jordan, Syria and
Lebanon, or to  Israel  through the El Arish-Ashkelon line, the
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
