  Thales SA ,  Europe ’s largest defense-
electronics producer, rose in Paris trading after predicting
that a “swift upturn” in operating profit will follow a 2010
loss caused by charges on aircraft programs and other contracts.  “We see the light at the end of the tunnel on these
difficult contracts that were inherited from the past,” Chief
Executive Officer Luc Vigneron told journalists today. He
forecast operating margins of 5 percent this year and 6 percent
in 2012.  The stock gained as much as 6.3 percent, the most since
Dec. 11, 2009, and was up 5.4 percent at 27.76 euros at 3:58
p.m. in Paris. That pared the French company’s decline in the
last 12 months to 14 percent.  Thales said it will book charges of more than 700 million
euros ($943 million) against 2010 earnings on risky contracts
signed before 2009, when Vigneron became CEO. That will cause an
operating loss of about 100 million euros, the first deficit in
almost 30 years, according to the company, based in Neuilly sur
Seine, near Paris.  “The group unveiled a significant cleanup of its balance
sheet,”  Yan Derocles , an analyst at Oddo Securities, told
investors today in a note. “This announcement may be the
catalyst that we were waiting for,” he said, as “the balance
sheet is now cleaned and 2011 should not be impacted by further
provisions.”  The charges relate to contracts including those for
components for Airbus SAS’s A400M military transport, said
Vigneron, who was put in charge of Thales by its biggest
shareholders,  Dassault Aviation SA , with 25.9 percent, and the
French state, with 27 percent. The costs follow an audit.  Airbus Pricing  Thales, which last year cut its dividend for the first time
in more than a decade, is seeking to renegotiate prices on a
contract with  Airbus Military , a division of European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., to supply systems for the
A400M. Thales has already booked 162 million euros in charges on
that project over the last two years.  Provisions will also be charged in 2010 for a Danish
ticketing-equipment order and for maritime patrol aircraft in  Turkey , Thales said.  Revenue probably increased 2 percent last year to 13.1
billion euros, with positive net cash flow of about 270 million
euros driven by “strict control” on costs and working capital,
Thales said today. Vigneron forecast a book-to-bill ratio of 1
in 2011 and 2012, meaning the company expects orders to match
sales.  Restructuring  Vigneron said the “swift upturn” in profitability will
lead to the margin increase, after restructuring charges and
before purchase price allocations, accounting for fair value of
assets and liabilities in acquisitions. Restructuring charges
will be about 1.5 percent of sales in 2011 and 1 percent of
revenue in 2012, Thales said.  Thales had an operating margin, or income from operations
as a proportion of sales, of 1.3 percent in 2009, after having
margins of more than 7 percent in 2005 and 2006, according to
Bloomberg data. Operating income totaled 168 million euros in
2009.  Vigneron also told journalists he’s confident he has
retained board and shareholder support, following reports
in French newspaper La Tribune that the government was
seeking to oust him.  To contact the reporters on this story:
