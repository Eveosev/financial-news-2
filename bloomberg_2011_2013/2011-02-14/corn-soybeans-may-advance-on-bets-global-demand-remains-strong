Corn may extend a rally and soybeans
may reverse last week’s decline on bets that global demand
remains robust, and that farmers will require higher prices when
deciding what crops to plant this spring.  Nineteen of 30 traders and analysts surveyed from Tokyo to
Chicago on Feb. 11 said corn will rise this week, and 18 of 31
respondents said soybeans will gain. Last week, corn futures for
May delivery rose 4.1 percent to $7.1725 a bushel on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade. Soybeans for March delivery lost 1.2 percent to
$14.16 a bushel.  Last week’s gain in corn was expected by the majority of
respondents surveyed on Feb. 4, while the drop in soybeans was a
surprise. Since 2004, the surveys have been correct 54 percent
of the time for corn, and 53 percent for soybeans.  Bullish on corn: 19    Bullish on soybeans: 18 Bearish on corn:
