The Georgian government and Qatar
plan to sign several economic agreements, mainly in the  energy
industry  in a bid to improve relations between the two
countries.  A Georgian delegation led by Foreign Minister Grigol Vashadze will visit Qatar on Feb 20-21 to meet with the Emir and
his counterpart and will sign agreements on double taxation as
well as hydropower cooperation, Deputy Foreign Minister Nino Kalandadze told reporters in Tbilisi today.  Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili turned to the Middle
East in 2009 to revive foreign investment that slowed after a
war with  Russia  in August 2008 and the global economic slump. He
said that he had attracted as much as $1 billion of investment
from the United Arab Emirates within the next two to three years
and a promise to invest “heavily” from Qatar.  Qatar is interested in energy opportunities in  Georgia ,
such as hydropower, and trade, Kalandadze said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
