President  Barack Obama  proposed
creating $2 billion of tax credits to spur transportation
projects for  New York City .  The administration, in its $3.7 trillion budget proposed
today, said it is seeking $200 million a year in tax credits
through 2021 for transportation projects tied to the New York
Liberty Zone, the area of lower Manhattan affected by the Sept.
11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  The proposal is a response to New York officials who
concluded that transit projects would foster development better
than some tax incentives meant to encourage building, the
administration said in its budget plan. Previous legislation
allowed New York state and city to sell tax-exempt securities to
finance work in the area.  The tax credits would be divided between the state and city
and could be deducted from payments the governments owe to the
federal government. They could be used for transportation
projects within, or into, the affected area of  Manhattan ,
according to the budget.  The same language was in the president’s budget last year
and “we hope it can become reality this year,” said  Marc LaVorgna , a spokesman to the mayor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
