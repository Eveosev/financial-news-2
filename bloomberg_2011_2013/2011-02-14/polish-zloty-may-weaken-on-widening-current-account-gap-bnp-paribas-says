The zloty may weaken versus the euro
after a report showed  Poland ’s current-account gap widened, BNP
Paribas SA wrote in a report to clients today.  “Euro-zloty is expected to pursue its upside correction in
the wake of poor current-account readings, although a break of
the 3.94 resistance is required for a real pickup in momentum,”
strategists led by Bartosz Pawlowski in  London  said in the note.  The zloty traded little changed at 3.9217 per euro as of
10:05 a.m. in Warsaw.  Poland said Feb. 11 its current-account deficit almost
doubled from a year earlier in December as faster economic
growth boosted demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
