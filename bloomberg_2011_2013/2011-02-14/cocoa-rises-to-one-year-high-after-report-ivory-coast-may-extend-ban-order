Cocoa rose to a one-year high on
speculation that an order to ban exports from the  Ivory Coast ,
the world’s largest producer, may be extended amid the disputed
presidential election.  Alassane Ouattara, recognized internationally as the winner
of Ivory Coast’s Nov. 28 vote, pledged to extend a one-month ban
on cocoa exports should Laurent Gbagbo refuse to step down
before Feb. 23, the Financial Times reported. The bid to cut off
funds for Gbagbo was imposed on Jan. 23. Prices have jumped 22
percent since late November.  “There’s stress and concern that the ban could be extended
and keep cocoa from leaving the country,” said Erica Rannestad,
a commodity analyst at CPM Group in New York. “The market is
really responding to Outarra’s statement.”  Cocoa for May delivery climbed $35, or 1 percent, to settle
at $3,406 a metric ton at 12:02 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Earlier, the price reached $3,444, the highest since Jan.
21, 2010.  An extension of the Ivorian export ban would be
“serious,” and supplies will tighten further, Rodger Wegner,
the secretary general of the German Cocoa Trade Association,
said in an e-mail.  In  London , cocoa futures for March delivery advanced 16
pounds, or 0.7 percent, to 2,239 pounds ($3,589) a ton on NYSE
Liffe, gaining for the fifth straight session.  To contact the reporters on this story:
