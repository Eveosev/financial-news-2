The forint weakened after comments
by Hungarian Central Bank Deputy Governor Julia Kiraly in
parliament indicated that the conflict between policy makers and
the government was intensifying.  The currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 272.18 per euro as
of 11:58 a.m. in Budapest, after gaining as much as 0.3 percent
in earlier trading today.  Lawmakers should reject a proposal that would give the
government more power to appoint policy makers, Kiraly told
Parliament’s Economy Committee in Budapest today. The bill,
which would strip Central Bank President Andras Simor of his
right to appoint two of the four rate-setters after their terms
expire on March 1, doesn’t serve the country’s economic
stability, Kiraly said.  Investors “feel the goal of the new changes is to ensure
the primacy of politics over the economy, the curbing of the
central bank’s independence,” Kiraly said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
