PGE SA,  Poland ’s biggest electricity
company, said it’s seeking funds for a  carbon capture  plant from
the European Union’s 4.5-billion-euro ($6 billion) program of
pollution permits.  PGE submitted its Belchatow carbon capture and storage
demonstration project in central Poland to the European
Commission funding initiative known as the New Entrants Reserve
300, Sylwia Filimon, a spokeswoman for PGE, said today.  Under the program, revenue from the sale of 300 million
allowances to emit carbon dioxide under Europe’s cap-and-trade
program will be used to aid CO2 capture and renewable energy
projects. The  European Investment Bank  will sell the permits and
disburse revenue via national governments.  The project would install carbon capture and storage
technology at a new 858-megawatt power plant in Belchatow. The
system would siphon off fossil fuel emissions blamed for  climate
change  and store them permanently underground.  PGE along with other project developers in the EU had to
submit their proposals to member states by Feb. 9. Poland’s
Ministry for Economy said in an e-mail that it received two
applications covering CCS projects. Nine were made in the U.K.,
and the Dutch government got about the same number covering both
CCS and renewable energy.  The Belchatow CCS project already won funding from the EU
under the European Economic Plan for Recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
