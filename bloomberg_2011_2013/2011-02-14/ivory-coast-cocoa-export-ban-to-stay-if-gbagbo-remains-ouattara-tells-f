Alassane Ouattara, the
internationally recognized winner of  Ivory Coast ’s Nov. 28
presidential election, has pledged to extend a one-month ban on
cocoa exports should incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo have not
left power by the time the restriction ends on Feb. 23, the
Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  “If Mr Gbagbo leaves, of course the ban will be removed,”
Ouattara said, according to the FT. “If he stays on, I just
think the ban will continue,” the newspaper reported Ouattara
as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
