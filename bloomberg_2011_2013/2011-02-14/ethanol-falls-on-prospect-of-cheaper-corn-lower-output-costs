Ethanol futures fell in  Chicago  on
forecasts for more corn planting and lower production costs for
distillers.  The biofuel slipped after an AgriSource Inc. survey showed
growers may boost corn acreage to 91.1 million from 88.192
million in 2010. Corn is the primary ingredient in U.S.-made
ethanol, with one bushel distilling into about 2.75 gallons of
the gasoline additive.  “There was a lot of talk with the planted acres,” said
Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in
Chicago. “Obviously, the ethanol plants want the cheapest price
for corn possible. These guys would like to see prices come
down.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery declined 1.8 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.447 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures are 44 percent higher than a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.525 a gallon and on the West Coast at $2.56,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago increased 0.5 cent to $2.44 a gallon and
in  New York  the fuel climbed 0.5 cent to $2.54.  Corn for March delivery slumped 10.75 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $6.9575 a bushel in Chicago. Futures are up 12
percent this year and 92 percent in the past year.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa are losing 9 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are losing 6 cents on
a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
