Hong Kong today started an inquest
into the Aug. 23 fatal tour-bus hijack in  Manila , with witnesses
from the  Philippines  declining an invitation to attend.  The inquest will take 25 days, said Coroner Michael Chan
Pik-kiu. None of the 116 witnesses from the Philippines agreed
to attend the hearing, which wants to determine “where, when
and how” victims had died during the hijacking, Chan said.  Tourists canceled trips to the Philippines after eight
members of a Hong Kong tour group died in the 10-hour police
siege of the bus. The Hong Kong government has told citizens to
 avoid all travel  to the Southeast nation after the Philippines
admitted the police had mishandled the crisis, which was
broadcast live around the world.  The inquest will use testimony made by those who were at
the scene or performed autopsies, Chan said. The results of the
hearing are unlikely to be usable as the basis for any civil
lawsuits because of the lack of jurisdiction, he said.  On Oct. 12, the  Hong Kong  government expressed its
disappointment with the Philippines for failing to take more
serious action against officials for their mishandling of the
siege. Police officers had stormed the bus after negotiations
failed with the hijacker, a disgruntled former inspector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
