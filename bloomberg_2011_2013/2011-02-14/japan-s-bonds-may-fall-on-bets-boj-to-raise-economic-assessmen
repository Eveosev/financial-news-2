Japan’s 10-year bonds may fall for a
second day on speculation the central bank will raise its
economic assessment today, damping demand for the relative
safety of government debt.  Ten-year yields may rise toward a 10-month high as  Bank of
Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa is scheduled to hold a press
conference after the two-day meeting. Bonds may also drop should
some investors reduce their debt holdings to prepare for an
auction of five-year notes tomorrow.  “As the BOJ is expected to adjust its economic assessment
upward, Shirakawa’s press conference should draw attention,”  Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co.,
wrote in a note today. “It seems investors will be hesitant to
push 10-year yields below 1.3 percent. I expect bonds to
weaken.”  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery last traded at
138.80 in  London  from 138.88 at the 3 p.m. close at the Tokyo
Stock Exchange yesterday. The contract will open for trading at
9 a.m. Tokyo time.  The benchmark 10-year bond hasn’t traded yet today at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The yield on the 1.2 percent bond due December 2020 rose half a
basis point to 1.3 percent yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Ten-year yields reached 1.35 percent on Feb. 9, the highest
since April 16.  Rates Unchanged, Auction  The central bank will keep the overnight rate between zero
and 0.1 percent today, according to all 15 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  The Ministry of Finance will sell 2.4 trillion yen ($28.8
billion) of five-year notes tomorrow. The prior five-year
auction on Jan. 18 drew bids worth 3.97 times the amount on
offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 2.78 at
the December sale.  Primary dealers, which are required to bid at government
debt sales, often reduce holdings of bonds before an auction in
case prices decline before they can pass on the new securities
to investors.  The 1.2 percent bond due in December 2020 closed at 99.08
to yield 1.305 percent yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Yen
Bond Fixing Price. The level is an average rate set at 6:30 p.m.
