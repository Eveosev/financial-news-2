The condition of Ukraine’s winter
grains was little changed in the week to Feb. 10, UkrAgroConsult
said, citing Agriculture Ministry data.  Grains in good condition accounted for about 56.2 percent
of the total planted area of 8.09 million hectares (19.99
million acres), compared with 56 percent a week earlier, the
Kiev-based researcher said today in an e-mailed statement. The
share of crops deemed weak totaled 6.2 percent, according to
UkrAgroConsult.  About 53.4 percent of rapeseed was in good condition and
38.2 percent was satisfactory, while 8.4 percent was deemed
weak. Winter rapeseed was in good condition on 37.9 percent of
the planted area at the same time last year, UkrAgroConsult
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
