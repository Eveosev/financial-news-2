Canada’s dollar advanced against the
euro for a third day on speculation the Bank of  Canada  may raise  interest rates  sooner than the  European Central Bank .  The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, dropped from a one-week high
versus its U.S. counterpart as crude oil, Canada’s biggest
export, fell. The Canadian currency earlier climbed as oil
gained after China’s imports increased more than forecast.  “We look at the situation in  Europe  as being unresolved,
and we look at the Canadian situation and we see the Bank of
Canada raising interest rates,” said  David Watt , senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
Markets unit in Toronto. “Canadian strength will be more
evident in these other currencies before we see a persistent
move in the Canadian dollar versus the  U.S. dollar .”  The loonie gained 0.3 percent to C$1.3342 versus the euro
at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.3386 on Feb. 11. The Canadian
dollar depreciated 0.2 percent to 98.91 cents per U.S. dollar,
from 98.74. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0110. The Canadian
currency advanced earlier to 98.51 cents, the strongest level
since Feb. 4.  The euro dropped against 15 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts including the loonie as Luxembourg Prime Minister
Jean-Claude Juncker said at a press conference after a meeting
of European finance ministers in Brussels today that they will
“closely” monitor efforts of the Portuguese government to
lower the country’s budget deficit.  Trade Surplus    Statistics Canada  reported last week the nation’s first
trade surplus in 10 months. The C$3 billion ($3 billion) surplus
in December followed a revised November deficit of C$115 million
as energy and metals powered the biggest jump in exports in
almost three decades, the government said Feb. 11.  “We’re seeing some very good results out of Canada for the
beginning of 2011,” said  John Curran , a senior vice president
in Toronto at CanadianForex Ltd., an online foreign-exchange
dealer. “If that continues, you may see the bank start to put
on their thinking caps in terms of rate hikes.”  The  Bank of Canada  has left its benchmark interest rate at
1 percent since boosting it for a third consecutive meeting in
September. BOC Governor  Mark Carney  said at the December meeting
exporters need to regain competitiveness damaged by a rising
currency and a global recession by making new investments to
boost productivity.  The ECB has kept its benchmark interest rate at a record
low 1 percent since May 2009.  Government Bonds  Canadian government bonds fell, pushing the yield on the
10-year benchmark up two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 3.48 percent after touching a nine-month high of 3.50 percent
last week. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in
June 2020 slid 13 cents to C$100.13.    China  reported today a smaller-than-forecast trade surplus
of about $6.5 billion in January as a rebounding economy and
rising commodity costs helped drive a 51 percent gain in
imports. The increase, the biggest in 10 months, compared with
the 27 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Futures on crude oil decreased 0.9 percent to $84.78 a
barrel in New York trading after earlier gaining 1.1 percent to
$86.52 a barrel. The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index added
1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
