Copper rose to a record in  London 
after imports increased in  China , the world’s largest metal
consumer.  Data from China’s customs agency showed that imports in
January surged 25 percent from a year earlier and 5.7 percent
from December. Copper prices are up 61 percent since July 1.  “I’m bullish” in the medium term, said James Roberts, a
broker at Sucden Financial Ltd., one of 12 trading companies on
the floor of the London Metal Exchange. “Whether this is
actually going into the factories or being stockpiled, that’s
the $1 million question.”  Copper for delivery in three months climbed $199, or 2
percent, to settle at $10,160 a metric ton ($4.61 a pound) at
6:10 p.m. on the LME. The price reached an all-time high of
$10,170.25 today.  On the Comex in  New York , copper futures for March delivery
rose 9.25 cents, or 2 percent, to settle at $4.6285 a pound.  Last month, China imported 364,240 tons of copper and
related products, the most since September.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest mining company,
forecast that prices will remain high before output from new
projects eases a supply shortfall. The International Copper
Study Group predicts mine output will trail consumption by
435,000 tons this year.  Tin climbed as much as 2.2 percent to a record $32,460 a
ton in London. Aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc also gained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
