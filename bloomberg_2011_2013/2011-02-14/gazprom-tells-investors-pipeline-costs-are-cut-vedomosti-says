OAO Gazprom told investors it cut
pipeline costs on major projects 38 percent between 2006 and
2009, Vedomosti reported.  The company said in an investor presentation Feb. 11 that
construction costs fell to 95 million rubles ($3.2 million) per
kilometer (0.6 mile), the newspaper said.  The costs refer to large diameter pipes and include only
the actual pipeline and not compressor stations and other
facilities, the newspaper said.  Gazprom, a state-run gas export monopoly and the largest
natural gas producer in the world, reported the data after Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin  ordered it to cut spending on pipelines
in October, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
