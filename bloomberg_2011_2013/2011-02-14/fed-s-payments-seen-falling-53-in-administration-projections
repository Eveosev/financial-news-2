The  Federal Reserve ’s payments to
the U.S. government will peak this year and decline each of the
next four years, approaching levels from before the financial
crisis, the Obama administration projected in its budget.  Fed deposits will reach a record estimated $79.5 billion in
the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 before declining 53 percent
through fiscal 2015 to $37.4 billion, according to the budget
released today. The central bank’s annual remittances averaged
$33.3 billion from fiscal 2007 through 2009.  The central bank’s increased payments reflect income from
$2.3 trillion in mortgage and Treasury securities it’s
purchasing as part of efforts to revive the economy after the
worst financial meltdown in seven decades. Declining payments
would reflect higher short-term  interest rates  in a “much
stronger” economy that’s generating more  tax revenue , Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week.  The administration’s budget estimates Fed deposits of $65.8
billion on fiscal 2012; $47.4 billion in 2013; $38.2 billion in
2014; $37.4 billion in 2015; and $41 billion in 2016.  The Fed’s $1.7 trillion first round of large-scale asset
purchases began in December 2008 and ended in March 2010. Last
November, the central bank started a second round totaling $600
billion through June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
