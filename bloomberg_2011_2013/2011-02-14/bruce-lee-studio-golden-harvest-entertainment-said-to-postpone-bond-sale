Orange Sky Golden Harvest
Entertainment (Holdings) Ltd., the film studio that made Bruce
Lee famous, delayed a planned sale of yuan bonds in  Hong Kong ,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The company is continuing to talk with investors as it
monitors market conditions, the person said, asking not to be
identified as details are private.  The film distributor and cinema operator was marketing 300
million yuan ($45.5 million) of three-year so-called Dim Sum
bonds at a yield of between 6.25 percent and 6.75 percent, three
people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.  Golden Harvest investor relations spokesman Regan Leung
declined to comment when contacted via telephone in Hong Kong.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Shelley Smith  in Hong Kong at
