Korea Resources Corp. and  Daewoo
International Corp . have made a nonbinding offer to buy  Australia â€™s  Whitehaven Coal Ltd ., the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing company officials the newspaper did not
identify.  Whitehaven is valued at about $3.51 billion, the Journal
said, without indicating the price offered by the Korea
Resources and Daewoo venture.  The coal company put itself up for sale last year and said
on Feb. 7 that several parties had been invited to offer
proposals, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
