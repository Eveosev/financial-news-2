Qatar International Petroleum
Marketing Co., known as Tasweeq, offered to sell 2.4 million
barrels of Al-Shaheen crude for loading in April, said two
traders who received the tender documents. That is less than the
company offered for March.  Details of the offer are as follows:  Al-Shaheen has qualities similar to  Saudi Arabia â€™s Arab
Medium crude oil. Qatar also exports two other grades, Qatar
Marine and Qatar Land, to customers in  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
