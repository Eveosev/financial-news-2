Acal Energy Ltd., a small company
that’s developed technology to cut the cost of hydrogen-powered
cars, will receive a 1 million-pound ($1.6 million) investment
from the Carbon Trust, a U.K. government agency that promotes
carbon reduction, the Financial Times reported.  Acal is working with Solvay SA, a Belgian chemical company,
and a Japanese car company that hasn’t so far been identified,
and aims to produce a commercial car engine by 2015, the
newspaper said.  The technology cuts the cost of fuel cells, which convert
stored hydrogen into electricity and water, by 40 percent, using
an alternative to platinum as a catalyst, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
