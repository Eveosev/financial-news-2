Estonia’s two-party ruling coalition
is set to increase its majority in parliament after the general
election next month,  Postimees  said, citing a poll and editorial
calculations.  The Reform Party of Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip  will win 40
seats in the 101-member Riigikogu, and the junior Isamaa ja Res
Publica Liit of former premier Mart Laar will get 18 seats,
compared with 31 and 19 in the last elections, respectively, the
Tallinn-based newspaper said.  The calculations are based on 677 people who plan to take
part in the March 6 vote and were polled last month. It
eliminates votes to single candidates who aren’t expected to get
enough support to win a parliamentary seat and to parties that
probably won’t reach the electoral threshold of 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
