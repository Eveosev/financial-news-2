John Lewis Partnership Plc plans to
expand its business into continental  Europe , developing its
website to attract orders from as many as 25 countries and to
gather information on which cities might provide suitable
locations for department stores, the Financial Times reported,
citing Commercial Director Andrea Oâ€™Donnell.  The company is building on success in the U.K., having
achieved record sales in the five weeks to Jan. 1, despite
weakening consumer spending and weather disruption, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
