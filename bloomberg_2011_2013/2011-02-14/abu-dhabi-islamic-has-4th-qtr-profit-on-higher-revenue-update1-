  Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank  PJSC, the  United Arab Emirates ’ second-biggest bank complying with Shariah
banking rules, posted a profit in the fourth quarter after
provisions declined by more than half and net revenue rose.  Net income was 114.1 million dirhams ($31 million) after a
loss of 623.3 million dirhams in the year-earlier period, the
bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  Credit provisions and impairments were down 68 percent, at
343.8 million dirhams, while income from fees and commissions
rose 43 percent to 90.2 million dirhams and net revenue from
funding activities rose 26 percent to 707.7 million dirhams.  “We will continue to take prudent measures, including
further impairments in the Burooj Real Estate portfolio,” Chief
Executive Officer Tirad Mahmoud said in the statement.  U.A.E. banks are recovering after the worst financial
crisis since the 1930s forced them to curb lending and take
heavy provisions. Economic growth in the country will accelerate
to 3.2 percent this year, from 2.4 percent in 2010, the
 International Monetary Fund  said in October.  Abu Dhabi Islamic was the main arranger of a syndicated
1.14 billion-dirham Islamic loan for Majid Al Futtaim Group, it
said in a statement on Dec. 14. In October, the bank sold $750
million of five-year bonds priced to yield 225 basis points more
than the benchmark mid-swap rate; the yield on the 3.745 percent
note has dropped 36 basis points so far this year, to 3.98
percent, according to Bloomberg prices.  Abu Dhabi Islamic shares advanced 1.6 percent to 3.11
dirhams at the close in the emirate today. The shares climbed 23
percent last year, compared with a 0.9 percent drop in the
benchmark ADX General Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
