Multiplus SA, the frequent-flyer
unit of Brazilian airline Tam SA, gained the most in two weeks
after fourth-quarter earnings beat analysts’ estimates.  Multiplus advanced 3.1 percent to 29.18 reais at 10:41 a.m.
New York time after jumping as much as 5.1 percent earlier, its
biggest intraday advance since Feb. 1. The Bovespa index rose
0.7 percent to 66,234.90.  Multiplus reported fourth-quarter net income 43.3 million
reais ($26 million), 8 percent more than the average estimate of
three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 8.4 percent
from the previous quarter to 325 million reais, according to a
regulatory filing.  “We remain enthusiastic about Multiplus’s growth
prospects, and see the recent share underperformance as
unwarranted, as the company’s fundamentals remain strong,”  Daniela Bretthauer , an analyst at Raymond James & Associates
Inc. in  Sao Paulo , said in a note to clients dated today.
“Multiplus is a good defensive stock in an environment of
rising inflation and interest rates.”  Strong cash flow generation indicates that the company’s
fundamentals remain solid, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a note
to clients dated yesterday.  “The company should continue to post strong growth rates
and build up a very strong cash position in the near term,”
said Luiz Otavio Campos, an analyst at Credit Suisse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
