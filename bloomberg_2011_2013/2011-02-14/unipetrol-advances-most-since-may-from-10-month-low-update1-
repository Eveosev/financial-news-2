  Unipetrol AS , the largest Czech oil
refiner, rallied the most since May today after falling 10
percent last week to its lowest price in 10 months.  The stock rose 4.7 percent to 179 koruna at its 5:13 p.m.
close in Prague, it biggest daily gain since May 26. It fell to
its lowest since April 8 on Feb. 11 after Unipetrol posted a
fourth-quarter loss and said it will shut down a facility for
maintenance and upgrades in August.  The selloff sent the stockâ€™s 14-day relative-strength index
to 22 at the Feb. 11 close, its lowest since September 2008.
Readings lower than 30 suggest to some technical analysts that a
security may rise. The RSI jumped to 38 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
