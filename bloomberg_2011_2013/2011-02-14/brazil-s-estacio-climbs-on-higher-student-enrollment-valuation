  Estacio Participacoes SA ,  Brazil ’s
largest private university administrator, rose the most in four
months on speculation increasing personal incomes will boost
enrollment.  Estacio climbed 5.5 percent to 23.40 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 3:15 p.m. New York time, the biggest
advance since Oct. 1. The Bovespa index rallied 1.2 percent to
66,557.55.  Estacio dropped 18 percent this year through last Friday,
and the 15 percent long-term profit margin implied by the
stock’s price is “too conservative” said Joao Carlos dos
Santos, an analyst at Banco BTG Pactual SA.  “It’s hard to catch a falling knife,” Santos wrote in a
note to clients dated yesterday. “Sector selloff seems flow-
driven, but fundamentals remain intact.”  The company will probably have strong student enrollment
this year as its plan to replace printed textbooks with tablet
computers spurs interest, Santos said. Estacio plans to start
the program in July as an experiment with its law students, the
company said in a statement published on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
