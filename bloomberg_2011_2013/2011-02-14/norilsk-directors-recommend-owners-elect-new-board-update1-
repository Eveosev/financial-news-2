OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel’s directors
recommended shareholders elect a new board at an extraordinary
meeting on March 11, backing a proposal by United Co. Rusal.  The directors approved a list of 27 candidates for 13
seats, the company said in a statement today. They include 12
nominees from billionaire  Vladimir Potanin ’s Interros Holding
Co., eight from Moscow-based Rusal and four from Norilsk
management.  The list also includes two managers from Trafigura Beheer
BV, which agreed to buy an 8 percent stake in Norilsk in
December, and one representative of billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s Metalloinvest, which holds 4 percent.  Norilsk, the world’s biggest nickel producer, on Feb. 11
increased an offer to buy back shares held by Rusal as it seeks
to end a battle between the aluminum company’s billionaire
founder Oleg Deripaska and Potanin for control of the business.
The nickel miner said it would pay $12.8 billion in cash for 20
percent of its shares.  “The decision to recommend voting for the re-election of
the board should help to stop this conflict as should the offer
from Norilsk to buy out Rusal’s stake in the company,” said
Andrei Bougrov, Norilsk board member and deputy chief executive
officer of Interros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
