Shanghai Automotive Industry
Corp., the parent of  China ’s largest domestic automaker, may
list all of its operating assets and is studying several
options to do so, said two people familiar with the company’s
plans.  SAIC Motor Corp. and Huayu Automotive Systems Co., the
two listed units of Shanghai Automotive, suspended trading of
their shares pending an announcement about a “major matter”
involving their parent, according to separate filings to the
stock exchange on Feb. 11.  Shanghai Automotive sold automaking assets to SAIC in
2006 and car-parts operations to Huayu in 2008 as part of a
wider transfer of businesses from China’s state-controlled
companies to listed units. The Shanghai government-owned
automaker is seeking to expand as vehicle sales jumped 32
percent in the nation last year.  Zhu Xiangjun, a Shanghai-based spokeswoman at SAIC,
didn’t return telephone calls seeking comment. Johan Willems,
GM’s Shanghai-based spokesman declined to comment.  SAIC, China’s biggest domestic automaker, is also
considering raising production capacity at its minivan
venture with  General Motors Co . by at least 15 percent from
its current target, said one person, who declined to be
identified because the discussions are private.  1.5 Million By 2013  SAIC-GM-Wuling Automotive Co., a joint venture between
GM, SAIC and the Liuzhou city government, are discussing ways
to increase production capacity to at least 1.5 million
vehicles by 2013, up from its current target of 1.3 million
vehicles, the person said. The automaker may build new plants
in Liuzhou in southern Guangxi province and in Qingdao in
eastern China, to meet market demand, the person said.  One of the options considered is to build a new factory,
the person said. A new factory with production capacity of
300,000 units may cost the venture up to 1.5 billion yuan
($227.4 million), the person estimated.  SAIC-GM-Wuling produces the best-selling Wuling
Sunshine minivan and is currently expanding its production in
Liuzhou, GM said in December. The automaker is building a new
production base with an annual capacity of 400,000 to support
production of its new brand of Baojun passenger cars, the
Detroit-based company said in December. The base is set to be
completed by the end of next year.  SAIC-GM-Wuling  SAIC-GM-Wuling will raise the capacity of its Liuzhou
base to 800,000 by end 2012, the venture said last June. The
automaker sold 754,961 Wuling Sunshine minivans, which cost
as little as 30,000 yuan, in China last year, according to
industry consultant JD Power and Associates.  Shanghai Automotive may inject automotive assets into
SAIC Motor Corp., Shanghai Securities News reported on its
website on Feb. 12, citing unidentified officials with
knowledge of the plan.  SAIC, which has joint ventures with  Volkswagen AG  in
China, has advanced 26 percent this year, compared with a 2.5
percent gain in the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index. SAIC
Motor shares have gained about 14 percent in the past 12
months.  The automaker’s 2010 net income may more than double
after sales increased 31 percent to more than 3.58 million
vehicles, it said in a Jan. 28 stock exchange filing. January
car sales rose 35 percent from a year earlier, the company
said Feb. 11.  --Liza Lin and Ying Tian. Editors: Chua Kong Ho, Kae Inoue.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
