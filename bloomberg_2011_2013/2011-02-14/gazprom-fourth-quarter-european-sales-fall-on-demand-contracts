OAO Gazprom’s natural-gas sales in  Europe  fell 8.1 percent in the fourth quarter led by lower
demand in Germany and France.  Gazprom sold 39.47 billion cubic meters of gas to central
and western European customers, the Moscow-based gas export
monopoly said in a fourth-quarter report posted today on its
 website . Sales in the same period of 2009 amounted to 42.97
billion cubic meters.  The Russian gas producer last year agreed with E.ON Ruhrgas
AG, Wingas GmbH,  GDF Suez  SA,  Eni SpA  and others customers, to
reduce prices or delay some contracted volumes to a later
period, Gazprom said in the report. The financial crisis and
less expensive supplies on the  spot market  damped demand for
Gazprom’s pipeline shipments, most of which are tied under long-
term contracts to oil and product prices.  Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, exported 139
billion cubic meters to Europe last year, failing to meet its
target to ship as much gas to its key market by revenue as in
2009, when it sold about 141 billion cubic meters, according to
an analyst presentation last week, a copy of which was given to
Bloomberg.  Sales to  Germany , the biggest buyer of Russian gas on the
continent, plunged more than 25 percent in the fourth quarter,
according to today’s report. Supplies to France fell almost 50
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
