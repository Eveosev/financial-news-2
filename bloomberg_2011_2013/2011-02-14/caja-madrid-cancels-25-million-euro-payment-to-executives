  Caja Madrid , a Spanish savings bank
that took public funds to restructure, said its board voted to
cancel a 25 million-euro ($34 million) payment to 10 executives.  The board today unanimously decided not to recognize the
rights of the directors in the period of 2007 to 2010, including
former Chairman Miguel Blesa, to the payments, a spokeswoman for
the lender said by telephone.  Caja  Madrid  and six other savings banks tapped about 4.5
billion euros from the governmentâ€™s bailout fund to restructure
their combined business. Banco Financiero y de Ahorros, the new
lender formed from their merger, said last month it would use a
stock market listing to raise capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
