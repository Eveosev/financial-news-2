Russia’s grain reserves dropped 24
percent to 32.8 million metric tons as of Jan. 1 from a year
earlier,  Russia’s Grain Union  said.  Some 15.2 million tons were in silos of major commercial
farms and 17.6 million tons were in the reserves of procurement
companies and millers, the union said today in a statement,
citing preliminary data from the Federal Statistics Service. The
reserves figure doesn’t include the holdings of small commercial
farms, the union said.  Most of the stockpiles were accumulated in the Southern,
Siberian, Volga and Central federal districts, with 7.5 million
tons, 6.8 million, 6.5 million and 6.3 million respectively.  Russia, which suffered the worst drought in at least a half
century last year, recorded a grains yield some 20 percent down
on 2009, according to the union. The overall yield was 1.8 tons
a hectare (2.47 acres), it said. The wheat yield dropped 19
percent to 1.9 tons a hectare, the rye yield declined about 42
percent to 1.2 tons, and the barley yield fell 27 percent to
almost 1.7 tons.    Russia ’s grains harvest totalled 60.9 million tons in 2010
and of that, wheat accounted for about 68 percent, up from 64
percent, while corn rose to 5 percent from 4 percent, the union
said. Barley dropped to 14 percent from 18 percent, while rye
fell to 2.7 percent from 4.5 percent, the union said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
