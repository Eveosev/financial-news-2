Wheat prices extended a rally to
the highest since 2008 on signs that political tension in the
Middle East and North Africa is spurring governments to boost
grain imports, while drought threatens the crop in  China .    Egypt , the world’s largest importer, on Feb. 11 agreed to
buy 170,000 metric tons, including 55,000 from the U.S. Iraq is
buying wheat from the U.S. and Australia, Reuters reported.
Prices in China, the world’s largest consumer and producer,
jumped to a record after the government said snow failed to
ease dry conditions.  “Unrest in the Middle East is probably causing some
stockpiling,” said Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global
Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette,  Indiana . The
market “is able to hang on there nicely, given the Egypt
tender and expectations for more tenders from the Middle East
in the next day or two.”  Wheat futures for May delivery rose 5.25 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $9.04 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $9.1675, the
highest for a most-active contract since August 2008. The grain
surged 80 percent in the past year after drought slashed
Russian production and floods damaged crops in  Australia  and  Canada .  Shrinking global supplies spurred a 26 percent jump in
U.S. wheat exports in 2010, and shipments to Egypt more than
doubled, the USDA said today.  Protests have spread to countries including Yemen and
Bahrain after Egypt’s  Hosni Mubarak  resigned as president
following more than two weeks of unrest.  China Snow  In China, most of the snow fell south of the main wheat
areas last week, Gail Martell, an agricultural meteorologist at
Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin-based Martell Crop Projections, said
in a report. The southwestern part of Shandong, a major growing
province, has had 0.2 inch (0.5 centimeter) of precipitation
since Oct. 1, compared with the normal 3.5 inches, Martell
said.  “China wheat is at an important turning point,” she
said.  As of Feb. 10, the drought affected 6.75 million hectares
(16.7 million acres) of crops, leaving 2.8 million people and
more than 2.5 million head of livestock short of drinking
water, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.  Wheat was the fourth most-valuable U.S. crop in 2009 at
$10.6 billion, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
