  Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields to a nine-month high, after a central bank survey showed
economists predict policy makers will raise interest rates in
April.  The yield on benchmark 11 percent bonds due July 2020 rose
13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 8.24 percent at
3:53 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s stock exchange.
That’s the highest level on a closing basis since May 20. The
price dropped 0.940 centavo to 117.536 centavos per peso.  Economists’ forecast for a rate increase in April marks a
change from the January  survey , when analysts predicted Banco de
la Republica would start lifting borrowing costs in June. This
month, the economists surveyed by the central bank also raised
their predictions for 2011 year-end inflation to 3.61 percent
from 3.57 percent in the previous survey.  Peso bonds, known as TES, “are reacting to the fact the
market now sees the central bank raising rates earlier,” said
Daniel Lozano, an analyst at Serfinco SA in Bogota.  In  minutes  published today of the central bank’s Jan. 31
meeting, policy makers reiterated that the bank may have to take
action on  interest rates  if inflation expectations rise above
the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target for this year.
The bank in January left the benchmark rate at a record low 3
percent for a ninth straight meeting.  TES are also hurt by higher inflation expectations amid the
rise in food prices, according to Juan Pablo Ayala, an analyst
at Acciones y Valores brokerage in Bogota.  Prices of vegetables and fruit rose last week as a
truckers’ strike cut reduced supply, the Agriculture Ministry
said in a Feb. 11 report.  “Food inflation has inertia,” said Ayala. “The central
bank has taken a hawkish stance and the fact that inflation
expectations are getting closer to the higher end of the bank’s
target isn’t helping.” He predicts inflation will quicken to
3.96 percent by yearend.  The peso slid 0.5 percent to 1,896.10 per  U.S. dollar  from
1,886 on Feb. 11. The currency has gained 0.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
