The  Ghana Stock Exchange  wants the
government to adopt legislation that would ensure that foreign-
owned banks, telecommunications companies and mining firms list
on the bourse, Ghana News Agency reported.  A deliberate government policy to get the units listed is
the only way for Ghanaians to benefit from the operations of the
companies, the Accra-based news agency cited Frank Adu, chairman
of the exchangeâ€™s council, as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
