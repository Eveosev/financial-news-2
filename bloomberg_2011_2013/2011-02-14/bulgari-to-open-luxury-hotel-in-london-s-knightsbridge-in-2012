  Bulgari SpA , the world’s third-
largest jeweler, said it signed an agreement to open a hotel in
London in 2012, strengthening its visibility in the U.K.  The hotel in Knightsbridge will be the Rome-based company’s
third after Milan and Bali and will have 85 rooms, including
seven 2,150 square-foot suites, Bulgari said today in an e-
mailed statement. It will feature a ballroom, a private cinema,
a spa and an indoor pool, as well as a restaurant and bar.  The project is “a further statement of our brand in the
U.K., which is a strategic market for  luxury goods ,” Bulgari
Chief Executive Officer Francesco Trapani said in the statement.  The hotel was designed by Antonio Citterio, Patricia Viel &
Partners, and Squire and Partners is the local architect for the
project, the jeweler said.  Financial details were not disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
