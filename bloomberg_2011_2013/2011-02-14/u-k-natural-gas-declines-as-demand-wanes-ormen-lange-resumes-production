U.K. natural gas fell as demand for
the heating fuel waned and output resumed at  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc ’s Ormen Lange field, boosting flows to Britain.  “Ormen Lange is back to normal production,” Kirsten Smart, a company spokeswoman, said by phone today from The
Hague. The field ramped up output over the weekend, she said.  Production at Ormen Lange halted last week due to a
“technical problem,” Shell said at the time. The field,  Europe ’s third-largest, can pump about 70 million cubic meters a
day and is the main source of gas for the Langeled pipeline from  Norway , the world’s longest sub-sea link, which supplies the
U.K.,  Belgium ,  France  and  Germany .  U.K. gas for next month declined as much as 1.2 pence, or
2.2 percent, to 52.35 pence a therm. The contract was at 52.9
pence at 4:30 p.m. in  London , which would be its lowest close
since Nov. 26, according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s equal to $8.47 a million British thermal units.  Langeled deliveries to Britain rose to about 68 million
cubic meters a day, National Grid Plc data show. Flows dropped
as low as 16 million cubic meters a day on Feb. 11.  National Grid forecast gas demand at 328 million cubic
meters in the 24 hours through 6 a.m. tomorrow, about 36 million
less than normal for the time of year. The nation’s pipelines
will hold 369 million cubic meters of gas at that time, about 24
million more than at the start of today.  Gas for same-day delivery dropped 2.4 pence, or 4.4
percent, to 51.9 pence a therm. Day-ahead gas was at 52.8 pence
at 4:30 p.m.  Five more liquefied natural gas carriers listed their
destination as the U.K. That includes a tanker due to arrive at
Excelerate Energy LLC’s Teesside Gasport in northeast  England .  U.K. baseload power for next-working day delivery dropped
30 pence to 45.50 pounds a megawatt-hour. Nearly half of the
nation’s electricity comes from natural gas-fed power stations
and so the fuel costs influence power prices.  Power for next month fell 55 pence, or 1.2 percent, to
45.85 pounds a megawatt-hour, broker data on Bloomberg show.
Baseload is delivered around the clock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
