President  Barack Obama â€™s proposed
budget would reduce spending on housing programs by $1.1
billion, including a $300 million cut in  community development
block grants , while boosting spending for the homeless.  The  Department of Housing and Urban Development  would get
$41.7 billion for the 2012 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, down
from $42.8 billion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30,
2010, the last year Congress passed a 12-month spending plan.  A few housing programs would see an increase. The proposed
HUD budget would spend $577 million more on assistance for the
homeless and $145 million in new vouchers for homeless veterans
and others.  In addition, $200 million would be included for a new
program designed to provide housing for more low-income
tenants. The program would help developers obtain funding to
renovate apartments, provide vouchers for tenants and create
housing developments for a mix of residents with different
incomes.  The community development block grant program, which began
in 1974, provides federal grants to states and localities for
affordable housing, infrastructure improvements, economic
development and other projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Jonathan D. Salant  in  Washington  at
