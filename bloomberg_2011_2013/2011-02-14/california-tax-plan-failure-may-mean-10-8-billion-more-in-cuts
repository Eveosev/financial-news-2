California would need to slash
spending by an additional $10.8 billion, half of that from
schools, if lawmakers or voters reject Governor  Jerry Brown ’s
proposal to extend temporary tax increases, the Legislative
Analyst’s Office said.  The cuts would come on top of the $12.5 billion Brown has
already  proposed  as part of his plan to eliminate a $25 billion  budget deficit  expected over the next 16 months, the nonpartisan
LAO said in a report requested by lawmakers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
