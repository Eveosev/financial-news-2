West Texas Intermediate crude oil
will be “virtually irrelevant” for energy companies outside of  North America  as the U.S. benchmark for delivery at Cushing,  Oklahoma , trades at a discount to global grades, said  Raymond
James  & Associates Inc. analysts.  “Transportation bottlenecks in and around Cushing will
force WTI to trade at a meaningful discount to other crudes
through 2011 and into 2012,” analysts including J. Marshall Adkins at Raymond James said in a note.  Stockpiles at Cushing, the delivery point for the New York
Mercantile Exchange futures contract, rose to a record 38.3
million barrels in the week ended Jan. 28.  Rail and truck shipments will ease the amount stored at the
hub during the next 18 months, according to Adkins. Producers
can ship crude via rail to the Gulf Coast for about $4 to $6 a
barrel and by truck for between $8 and $10 a barrel, the
analysts said.  Brent is “the new undisputed champion of global crude
price benchmarks,” and “WTI is dead,” said the analysts, who
estimated that Brent will average $97.50 a barrel this year and
$104.50 in 2012.  The discount of WTI futures for April delivery to April
Brent, the basis for European and West African crudes, was
$13.83 at 10.05 a.m. in  New York . In 2010 the differential
between the two grades for prompt delivery averaged 76 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
