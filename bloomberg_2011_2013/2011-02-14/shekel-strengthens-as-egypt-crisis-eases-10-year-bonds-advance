The Israeli shekel advanced for the
first time in four days against the dollar as concern  Egypt ’s
crisis would deepen eased.  Government bonds  rose.  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down on Feb. 11
and handed power to the military, bowing to the demands of
protesters who occupied Tahrir Square in central Cairo for
almost three weeks. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces
pledged to honor all international and regional treaties signed
by the North African nation. Egypt was the first Arab country to
agree to a peace accord with  Israel  in 1979.  “For now, concern about the Egypt situation is abating and
the focus is shifting to the economic scenario,” said Tom Gerszbejn, a trader at Union Bank of Israel Ltd. in Tel Aviv.
“I still think the developments in Egypt are dangerous for
Israel but for now there is respite.”  The shekel rose 0.4 percent to 3.6690 against the dollar at
4:34 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . It earlier strengthened to 3.6609, the
highest since Feb. 9. The local currency gained for the third
day against the euro, rising 1.2 percent to 4.9360 per euro.  The yield on the benchmark 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit
dropped 2 basis points to 5.01 percent, the lowest level since
Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
