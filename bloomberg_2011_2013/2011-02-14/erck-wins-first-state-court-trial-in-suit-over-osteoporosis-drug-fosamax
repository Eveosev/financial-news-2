Merck & Co. won the first state-
court trial in which its Fosamax osteoporosis drug was blamed
for so-called jaw death.   Fosamax didnâ€™t cause Alison Rosenberg, 67, of  Pennsylvania 
to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw, or ONJ, a jury in Atlantic
City, New Jersey, found today. Merck previously won two of three
cases that went to a verdict in Manhattan federal court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
