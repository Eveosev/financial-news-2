Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures fell to the lowest level since November
amid ample fuel supplies in the U.S. and easing tensions in  Egypt  following the ouster last week of President  Hosni Mubarak .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28.1 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York , up
from 27.2 percent Feb. 11.  Oil for March delivery fell 77 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
settle at $84.81 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the lowest price since Nov. 30. Futures are up 14 percent from a
year ago.  March $84 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 4,493 lots changing hands. They were
unchanged from Feb. 11 at 44 cents a barrel. March $90 calls,
the next-most active contract, dropped 6 cents to 4 cents a
barrel with 2,958 contracts trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  April $100 calls were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 10,283 lots changing hands. They fell 9
cents to 37 cents a barrel. The next-most active option, March
$85 puts, gained 21 cents to 77 a barrel on 6,487 contracts.  Open interest was highest for April $100 calls with 42,719
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 40,528 and March
$100 calls with 39,754.  To contact the reporter on this story:
