  Portugal  led an increase in the cost
of insuring European government debt on concern austerity
measures and inflation will undermine the region’s growth.  Credit-default swaps on Portuguese sovereign bonds jumped
18 basis points to 461, helping push the Markit iTraxx SovX
Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments up 6 basis
points to 180, according to CMA.  Portugal’s economy contracted in the fourth quarter for the
first time in a year as the government cut spending and raised
taxes to narrow its  budget deficit . Reports this week may show
inflation accelerated in the U.K., U.S. and  China .  “There is concern regarding inflation and growth
figures,” said  Philip Gisdakis , a Munich-based strategist at
UniCredit SpA. “It is quite clear the sovereign debt crisis is
not yet over.”  Credit-default swaps on  Greece  soared 27 basis points to
880, Ireland climbed 14 to 584,  Spain  increased 9 to 254 and
Italy was 2.5 higher at 184, CMA prices show. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Swaps on Bahrain jumped 11 basis points to 248, the highest
since Feb. 4, as protestors inspired by uprisings in Egypt and
Tunisia clashed with police. Contracts on Egypt increased 5.5
basis points to 330, CMA prices show.  Sovereign concerns also weighed on confidence in Europe’s
banks, pushing the cost of insuring financial debt to the
highest in two weeks.  Financial Swaps  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 7 basis points to 167, and
the subordinated index was up 11.5 at 281.5, both the highest
since Jan. 31, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The cost of protecting corporate bonds from default was
little changed, with the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings 1 basis point
higher at 400. The Markit iTraxx  Europe  Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings rose 1.5 basis points to 97.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
