The German government is working on
proposed changes in how companies can deduct losses from future
profits to reduce their tax bill, Die Welt reported, citing
Finance Ministry data.  A Finance Ministry working group aims to present proposals
by September, the  newspaper  said today in an e-mailed article to
be published tomorrow. It didnâ€™t specify possible changes.  More than 52 percent of German corporations have loss
carry-forwards on their books, Die Welt said, citing a Finance
Ministry document based on 2006 data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
