Indonesia’s rupiah advanced for the
first time in four days as concern Egypt’s crisis would deepen
eased and Indonesia’s economic growth outlook boosted investor
appetite for the nation’s assets.  Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  resigned on Feb. 11, after
protesters occupied central Cairo for 18 days to demand an end
to his 30-year rule. Indonesia’s gross domestic product expanded
6.9 percent in the three months through December from a year
earlier, the most since the quarter ended December 2004, the
statistics bureau said on Feb. 7.  “The worst has passed in Egypt and that’s helping  Asia ,
including Indonesia,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of foreign-
exchange trading at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta.
“Locally, faster economic growth has helped the rupiah.”  The rupiah gained 0.3 percent to 8,918 per dollar as of
4:24 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has strengthened 0.7 percent this year, and is the
top performer among Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies. The rupiah
may trade between 8,900 and 8,950 this week, said Susanto.  The  Jakarta Composite Index  rose 0.7 percent to 3,416.77
today. Foreign holdings of the country’s bonds rose to 198.94
trillion rupiah ($22.3 billion) as of Feb. 11, from 194.44
trillion rupiah on Feb. 4, according to finance ministry data.    Bank Indonesia  unexpectedly lifted its  reference rate  to
6.75 percent from a record-low 6.50 percent on Feb. 4, the first
increase since October 2008, as inflation accelerated to 7.02
percent in January from 6.96 percent in December.  Ten-year  government bonds  fell. The yield on the 8.25
percent note maturing in July 2021 climbed one basis point to
9.02 percent, according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
