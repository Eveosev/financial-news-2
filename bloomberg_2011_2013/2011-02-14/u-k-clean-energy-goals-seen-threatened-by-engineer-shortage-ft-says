U.K. plans to develop renewable
energy and improve power-generation and transmission systems is
threatened by a shortage of engineers, according to Ignacio Galan, the chief executive officer of  Iberdrola SA , which owns
Scottish Power Ltd., the Financial Times reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, Galan said 80 percent
of Scottish Power’s engineers are due to retire in the next 15
years, and that situation is typical of Britain’s power-
generation industry as a whole, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
