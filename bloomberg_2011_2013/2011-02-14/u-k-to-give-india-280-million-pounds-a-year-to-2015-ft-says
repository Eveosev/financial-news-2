U.K. International Development
Secretary  Andrew Mitchell  said British aid to  India  won’t be cut
and is to remain at 280 million pounds ($449 million) a year
until 2015, the Financial Times reported, citing an interview
with Mitchell.  The funds, which will be directed into more investment in
private businesses, are to be maintained because of the
“development paradox” presented by India, where rapid economic
growth has failed to eradicate poverty, and the country has
“more poor people in it than the whole of sub-Saharan Africa,”
the newspaper said, citing Mitchell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
