German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said the debate about the European Financial Stability
Facility sends markets the wrong signals suggesting urgent
action is needed,  El Pais  reported, citing an interview.  He added that markets have been stable since the start of
the year, the euro isn’t in danger and the EU monetary union
won’t break up, the newspaper reported.  Schaeuble also said  Germany  needs to reduce its debt, El
Pais reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
