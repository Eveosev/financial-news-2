Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said it’s
issuing about 6 billion Swiss francs ($6.17 billion) of Tier-1
buffer capital notes to Qatar Holding LLC and The Olayan Group
to satisfy new Swiss capital-adequacy rules under the “too-big-to-fail” regime.  “We have worked in close cooperation with our primary
regulator, Finma, to ensure that the buffer capital notes will
qualify under the future Swiss capital rules as contingent
capital,” Chief Executive Officer  Brady Dougan  said today in an
e-mailed statement. The notes are to be paid no earlier than
October 2013 in cash or in exchange for Tier 1 capital notes
issued in 2008.  EQUITIES:
