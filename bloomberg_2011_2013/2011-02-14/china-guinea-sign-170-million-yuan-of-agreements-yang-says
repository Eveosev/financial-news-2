Guinea and  China  signed two
cooperation agreements worth 170 million yuan ($26 million),
Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said, without giving
details of the projects.  “China is ready to strengthen the economic and commercial
cooperation with Guinea,” Yang said today in the capital,
Conakry. China will encourage its companies to enter Guinea, to
invest in infrastructure, electricity and agriculture, he said.  President  Alpha Conde  invited China to build a
hydroelectric power plant and a thermal power plant in the West
African nation.  Separately, Conde said the nation was in talks with an
unspecified Chinese company to build a bauxite operation in the
country. Guinea holds as much as half of the world’s reserves of
bauxite, a raw material used in aluminum production.    Guinea  is negotiating with a Chinese company to carry out
a bauxite alumina project with annual production capacity of 4
million tons,” Conde said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
