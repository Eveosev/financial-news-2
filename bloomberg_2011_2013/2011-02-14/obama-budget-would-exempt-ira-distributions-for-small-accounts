Retirees with less than $50,000 in
their individual retirement accounts may not have to take
required withdrawals under President  Barack Obama ’s proposed
budget.  “The administration proposes to simplify tax compliance
for retirees of modest means,” the budget says. The proposal is
part of a $3.7 trillion spending blueprint for fiscal year 2012
sent to Congress today.  Required minimum distributions generally apply to people
with a tax-deferred traditional IRA who are 70 1/2 years or
older. About 38.5 million U.S. households, or one-third, owned a
traditional IRA last year, up from 36.6 million in 2009,
according to a December  report  by the Investment Company
Institute. The median for assets in traditional IRAs last year
was $40,000, according to ICI, a Washington-based mutual-fund
trade group.  The administration proposal would exempt retirees from the
distribution  requirement  if the aggregate value of their IRA
doesn’t exceed $50,000 starting the year they turn 70 1/2 or
die, the budget says. The mandates would phase in for
individuals with aggregate retirement balances between $50,000
and $60,000.  Sixty-four percent of people who took money out of their
IRAs in 2008 did so because of the requirement, according to a
January 2010 study by ICI. Required withdrawals are based on a
formula of the account balance and the individual’s age.  The U.S. government suspended required minimum
distributions for tax year 2009 in response to plummeting
balances after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 38
percent in 2008. Mandatory distributions returned in 2010 as the
economy strengthened and the  S&P 500  rose 23 percent in 2009.  Roth IRAs , which are funded with post-tax dollars, are exempt
from minimum withdrawal rules while the owner is alive.  IRAs held $4.2 trillion at the end of the second quarter of
2010, according to ICI.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Margaret Collins  in New York at
