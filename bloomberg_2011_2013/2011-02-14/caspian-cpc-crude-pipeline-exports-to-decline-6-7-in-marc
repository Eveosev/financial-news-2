a preliminary loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  CPC, as the group of producers is known, will ship 2.57
million metric tons of crude in March. This is equivalent to
19.98 million barrels, or 644,534 barrels a day, compared with
691,031 barrels a day this month, according to the loading plan.  The final shipment plan for March will be released later
this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
