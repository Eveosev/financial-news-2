  HFC Bank Ghana Ltd ., which provides
mortgages in the West African nation, rose to the highest in two
weeks on investors’ hopes that the bank’s partnership in a
government housing project will boost profit.  The stock rose 1 pesewa, or 2.6 percent, to 40 pesewas by
the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Accra. It was the highest since
Jan. 31.  STX Corp., a South Korean construction company, began work
on Jan. 27 on a $1.5 billion project to build 30,000 units for
Ghana’s security services. HFC “will be providing mortgages to
people who want to own houses built under the project,” Enyonam Dagadu, a trader with African Alliance Securities Ghana Ltd.,
said by phone from Accra.  “Some investors are strategically positioning themselves
to reap when the bank begins to make profit from the STX housing
project,” she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
