Nigeria plans to revive struggling
automobile assembly plants with a 550 billion naira fund ($3.61
billion), the local  Guardian  reported.  The project aims to boost production of cars by  Volkswagen
AG  and Peugeot SA, and buses by  Daimler AG â€™s Mercedes Benz,
while also encouraging citizens to buy locally manufactured
vehicles instead of imported ones, the Lagos-based newspaper
said, citing unidentified officials.  The  central bank  will disburse the money to the companies
through the Bank of Industries, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
