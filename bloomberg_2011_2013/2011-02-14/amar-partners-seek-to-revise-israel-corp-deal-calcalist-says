(Corrects name of company to say Israel Electric Corp. in
first paragraph.)  Companies developing the Tamar  gas
field  are seeking to revise the terms of an earlier initial
understanding to supply gas to Israel Electric Corp. after the
government-appointed Sheshinski committee raised the tax on
profits, Calcalist reported, citing a letter sent by the
partnership.  Calls to a spokesman for the Tamar partners placed before
office hours went unanswered.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
