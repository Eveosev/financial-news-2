  Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
second day as energy and telecommunications companies in the
East African nation bought dollars to pay bills in the foreign
currency.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
to 81.45 per dollar by 3:45 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, from a
close on Feb. 11 of 81.38, according to data from CFC Stanbic
Bank Ltd.  The shilling “is expected to trade within the 81.50-82
range as businesses seek more dollars to settle their end-month
bills,” Steve Lagat a dealer at lender, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
