President  Barack Obama  proposed
increasing the budget for the  Internal Revenue Service  by 9.4
percent to hire more than 5,000 new employees, most of whom
would pursue tax cheats.  The president’s fiscal 2012 budget released today sets
funding for the tax-collection agency at $13.3 billion, an
increase of $1.1 billion from 2010, the last time a full
appropriation was made for the IRS.  Almost half of the increase, or $460 million, would
support the agency’s tax-enforcement programs. Under the plan,
the IRS would focus on fighting  tax evasion  through the use of
offshore accounts and cheating by corporate and high-wealth
taxpayers. It also would seek out fraudulent tax preparers.  These enforcement efforts would yield $1.3 billion in
additional revenue in two years, according to the budget plan.
Obama’s budget also proposes other compliance initiatives it
estimates would generate $56 billion over the next decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
