German power for next-day delivery
advanced as production from wind was forecast to drop in  Europe ’s biggest market. French prices also rose.  Output from  wind turbines , a less predictable source of
energy than nuclear, coal or gas-fired generation, will decline
tomorrow to below 8,000 megawatts from 10,000 megawatts today,
 Markedskraft Deutschland GmbH  said in an e-mailed report. That’s
still more than the average for this time of year of 6,000
megawatts. Wind produced 6.8 percent of Germany’s power in 2009.  Baseload day-ahead electricity advanced 17 percent to 55.33
euros ($74.63) a megawatt-hour on the  Epex Spot SE  exchange in
Paris. The corresponding French day-ahead contract gained 9.7
percent to 55.73 euros. Baseload is delivered around the clock.  Electricite de France SA, the world’s biggest operator of
atomic plants, restarted its 880-megawatt Fessenheim-1 nuclear
reactor today after yesterday’s stop, the company’s grid unit
Reseau de Transport d’Electricite said on its website.  Power for next-year delivery in  Germany  rose a third day.
The European benchmark advanced 0.1 percent to 52.05 euros a
megawatt-hour, according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg.
The country, Europe’s biggest economy, also gets power from
nuclear, hard coal, lignite, natural gas and solar stations.  Bloomberg tracks prices from brokers including ICAP Plc,
GFI Group Inc., Spectron Group Ltd. and Tullett Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
