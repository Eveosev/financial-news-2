The demutualization of the Kenyan
Stock Exchange, a process that started in March 2009, will be
completed by the middle of this year, said Stella Kilonzo, chief
executive officer of the  Capital Markets Authority .  “Appropriate legislation was adopted in December,”
Kilonzo said in an interview on Feb. 11, in Flic-en-Flac, south
of Port-Louis, the capital. “The demutualization process should
be completed by end of June 2011 giving way to the New National
Securities Exchange.”  Demutualization is the separation of ownership from the
management of a stock exchange, with a view to running the
bourse as profit-making entity, she said. The market
capitalization of  Kenya ’s stock exchange is $15 billion, with
average daily trading volume of 500 million shillings.  “After demutualization we expect market liquidity to grow
and double,” Kilonzo said, without saying over what period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
