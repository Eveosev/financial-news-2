Petro Harvester Oil & Gas LLC, the
exploration company formed by private-equity firm TPG Capital,
agreed to buy properties covering about 35,000 acres in  North
Dakota ’s Williston Basin. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  Petro Harvester, based in Houston, didn’t name the seller
of the properties in a statement today. Petro Harvester was
formed in October by  Fort Worth , Texas-based TPG.  TPG, with about $48 billion in assets under management, is
expanding investments in oil and gas-related companies. Fellow
buyout firms such as KKR & Co. have pursued similar strategies
in a bet that energy prices will rise in a recovering economy.  “These assets are an excellent addition to our portfolio
as we continue to grow Petro Harvester’s scale,” Gareth
Roberts, the explorer’s non-executive chairman, said in the
statement.  The Williston acquisition comprises 170 wells in 24 fields
and follows Petro Harvester’s purchase last year of properties
in Mississippi from Comstock Resources Inc.  Petro Harvester also said today it planned to open an
office in Denver.  TPG also owns Energy Future Holdings Corp., the Texas power
producer formerly known as TXU Corp. TPG, along with KKR, bought
that company in 2007 for $43.2 billion in history’s biggest
leveraged buyout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
