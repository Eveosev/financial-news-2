Karsan Otomotiv Sanayii & Ticaret
AS, a Turkish car manufacturer, surged to the highest in almost
three years after Zaman newspaper reported that a survey of New
Yorkers ranked its taxi design as the favorite among three
finalists.  Shares of the Bursa-based automaker gained 30 kurus, or 15
percent, to 2.31 liras, the highest since April 2008, at 2:44
p.m. in Istanbul.  Two-thirds of those surveyed said they liked Karsan’s
design, compared with 44 percent for Nissan Motor Co.’s and 38
percent for Ford Motor Co.’s,  Zaman  newspaper said, citing a
press conference by David Yassky, chairman of  New York ’s taxi
and limousine commission.  Karsan, Ford and Nissan are competing to design a new model
for New York’s 26,500 cabs in the next 10 years, including an
initial 13,000 units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
