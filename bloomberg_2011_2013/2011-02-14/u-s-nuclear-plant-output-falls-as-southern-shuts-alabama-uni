U.S. nuclear production
fell 1.1 percent after Southern Co. shut the Farley 2 reactor in
Alabama and  Constellation Energy Group Inc . closed Calvert
Cliffs unit 2 in Maryland, according to the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.  Production from U.S. reactors fell 1,020 megawatts from
Feb. 11 to 93,459 megawatts, or 92 percent of capacity,
according to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Six of 104 units were offline.  Constellation shut the 867-megawatt Calvert Cliffs 2
reactor located about 38 miles (61 kilometers) south of
Annapolis. Southern closed the 860-megawatt Farley 2 reactor
located about 18 miles east of Dothan.  Exelon Corp. shut its 1,120-megawatt LaSalle 2 reactor in  Illinois  for refueling and maintenance, Krista Lopykinski, a
plant spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. Unit 1, which
had been shut, was started and will provide power while unit 2
is down, she said.  The LaSalle station is located about 70 miles southwest of
Chicago.    Entergy Corp . increased output from its 989-megawatt River
Bend 1 reactor in Louisiana to 58 percent of capacity from 1
percent on Feb. 11. The River Bend is located about 24 miles
