  Hedge funds  cut their bullish
positions on cotton to the lowest level since July, even as
prices surged last week to a U.S. record, after a  New York 
exchange imposed new disclosure rules for larger holdings.  In the week ended Feb. 8, the net-long positions, or bets
on rising prices, to 38,465 futures and options contracts on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data showed. The 11 percent decline was the biggest since mid-
November.  ICE said this month that traders who want to hold more than
300 cotton contracts must prove an economic need for them during
the notice period when the commodity is delivered, as part of an
effort to curb price volatility. Cotton has more than doubled in
the past year, touching a record $1.9455 a pound on Feb. 11.  “Many liquidated positions were prompted by the exchange’s
rule,” said  Sharon Johnson , a senior analyst at Penson Futures
in Atlanta. “The week, we saw speculative traders also book
profits as prices surged.”  Cotton for March delivery jumped 13 percent last week, the
most since early December, to settle Feb. 11 at $1.8997.  Prices have surged on concern that global demand will
outpace production, after adverse weather damaged crops and
mills boosted purchases in  China , the world’s largest user.  Managed-money positions include hedge funds, commodity
pools and commodity-trading advisers. Analysts and investors
follow changes in speculator positions because such transactions
may reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
