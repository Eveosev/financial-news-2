Serbia will keep its public debt
below an agreed limit of 45 percent of gross domestic product
this year as it tightens its list of projects that require
borrowing,  Tanjug  news agency reported, citing Deputy Finance
Minister Vuk Djokovic.  The policies will be closely watched by a special Fiscal
Council whose launch is expected soon, after the parliament
appoints its members, Djokovic was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
