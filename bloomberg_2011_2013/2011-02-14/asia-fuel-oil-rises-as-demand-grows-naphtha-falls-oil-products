Asia  fuel oil  rose to a 29-month
high as demand increased. Naphtha fell to the lowest in two
weeks. Gasoil declined, ending a four-day rally, after
stockpiles increased.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil rose 2.8 percent to
$605.50 a metric ton, the highest since Sept. 9, 2008, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of 380-centistoke fuel
oil, mainly used as marine fuel, gained 1.6 percent to $588.25.  The premium of the 180-centistoke grade above 380-
centistoke, or the viscosity spread, rose to $17.25 a ton from
$10.50 a ton on Feb. 11.  Japan’s 10 regional utilities used 49 percent more fuel oil
at thermal  power plants  in January compared with a year earlier,
as colder weather increased demand for heating. The utilities
consumed 748,606 kiloliters, up from 502,220 kiloliters a year
earlier, according to data released by the Federation of
Electric Power Companies of Japan today.  Bunker fuel sales in Singapore rose to a record 3.64
million tons in January, according to preliminary data announced
by the  Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore  on its website.  Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. offered to sell
80,000 tons of maximum 3.5 percent sulfur 380-centistoke fuel
oil for loading between April 11 and April 13 at New Mangalore
port, according to a document e-mailed to buyers.  BP Plc bought two 180-centistoke fuel-oil cargoes in the
spot market today, said two traders. It bought 40,000 tons from
Gunvor International BV at $607 a ton for loading between March
1 and March 5 and from Westport at $605 a ton for loading
between March 6 and March 10.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to Japan fell 0.8
percent to $865.50 a ton, the lowest since Jan. 28, according to
Bloomberg data.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline for loading from Singapore rose
0.2 percent to $105.85 a barrel. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha
widened $1 to $11.50 a barrel. A bigger reforming margin means
the profit from turning naphtha into gasoline is rising.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to  Brent crude , or
the crack spread, dropped to $102.23 a ton from $107.42 at the
end of Asian trading on Feb. 11, according to Bloomberg data.  Gunvor bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for delivery in the
first half of April from Glencore International AG at $866 a
ton, traders said. Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold 50,000 barrels of
92-RON gasoline for loading March 12 to March 16 to Trafigura
Beheer BV at $105.80 a barrel. PetroChina Co. sold 50,000
barrels of 92-RON loading March 1 to March 5 to BP at $106 a
barrel.  Middle Distillates  Benchmark gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur fell 0.7 percent
to $114.85 a barrel, the first decline since Feb. 7, Bloomberg
data showed. Jet fuel dropped 0.9 percent to $116.75 a barrel.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude rose to $17.97 a barrel
from $17.79 on Feb. 11, Bloomberg data showed.  Middle distillate stockpiles in  Singapore  rose 16 percent
to 13.7 million barrels in the nine days ending Feb. 9, a unit
of the trade ministry said last week. Supplies are at the
highest since Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
