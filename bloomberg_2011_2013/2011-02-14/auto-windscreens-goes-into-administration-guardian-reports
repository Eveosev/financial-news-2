Auto Windscreens Ltd. has gone into
administration, putting 1,100 jobs at the Chesterfield, U.K.-
based company at risk, the Guardian reported, citing a statement
from administrators Deloitte LLP.  The company had been in talks with potential investors
about recapitalizing, the Guardian said, but received “a
winding-up petition” from tax officials, and lost one of its
biggest customers, Deloitte said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
