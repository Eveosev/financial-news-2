Valentine’s Day, celebrated by
lovers worldwide with candy, flowers and amateur poetry, also is
the biggest time of year for new prescriptions of erection
drugs, led by  Pfizer Inc .’s Viagra.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows weekly new prescriptions of the
two top-selling impotence drugs, Viagra and  Eli Lilly & Co .’s
Cialis, jump to yearly highs in the days leading to the Feb. 14
holiday. The blue line shows Viagra; the green line Cialis. The
red circles point to prescriptions in the week before
Valentine’s Day. The data are reported by retail pharmacies in
the U.S. and compiled by Bloomberg.  Erectile dysfunction affects as many as 30 million men in
the U.S., according to the  National Institutes of Health  in
Bethesda, Maryland. Stress, guilt and fear of failure can
exacerbate the disorder, especially around the holiday when men
feel their love is being tested, said Gail Wyatt, a certified
sex therapist and psychology professor at the University of
California,  Los Angeles .  “It’s almost like: ‘This is Valentine’s Day, so I must
have sex,’” Wyatt said in a telephone interview. “All of this
is media and marketing promoted, and I think we need to get back
to what’s really important in life, and that’s really just being
with people we care about.”  Prescriptions of Viagra, first approved in 1998, declined
in recent years as increasing numbers of patients chose Cialis,
which came to market in 2003. Viagra had $1.9 billion in sales
last year for New York-based Pfizer, compared with $1.7 billion
for Indianapolis-based Lilly’s Cialis.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Tom Randall  in New York at
