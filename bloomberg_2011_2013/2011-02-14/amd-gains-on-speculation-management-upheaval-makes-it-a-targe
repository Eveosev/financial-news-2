  Advanced Micro Devices Inc ., the
second-largest maker of processors for personal computers, rose
in  New York  trading on speculation that the departure of top
executives has made it an acquisition target.  “There is no management team there,” said  Patrick Wang , an
analyst at Wedbush Securities in New York. There is some
“chatter” that the company is up for sale, he said. “It’s a far-
fetched possibility.”  Last week, Sunnyvale, California-based AMD said Chief
Operating Officer Robert Rivet and strategy head Marty Seyer are
leaving the company. Their departures follow the exit of Chief
Executive Officer Dirk Meyer, who resigned Jan. 10 after a
dispute with the board over progress in winning back server
market share and a lack of offerings for the rapidly growing
mobile computer market.  AMD gained 35 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $8.63 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 5.5 percent this year.  Chief Financial Officer Thomas Seifert is acting as interim
CEO. He has said he doesn’t want the promotion to be permanent.  There’s also some speculation that computer makers will
announce plans to build machines based on AMD’s new Bulldozer
chip, Wang said.  AMD competes with  Intel Corp . in the market for personal-
computer processors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
