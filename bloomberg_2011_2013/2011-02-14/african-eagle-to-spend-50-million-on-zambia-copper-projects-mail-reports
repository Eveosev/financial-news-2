African Eagle Resources Plc plans to
invest between $40 million and $50 million this year developing
“small” copper mining operations in  Zambia , the  Daily Mail 
reported, citing Operations Manager Chris Davies.  The London-listed miner will begin operations in Zambia’s
Mkushi district this year before moving into large-scale copper
mining next year, the Lusaka-based newspaper said.  African Eagle may also list its Zambian units, Katanga
Resources Ltd. and Kujima Mining and Exploration Ltd., on
London’s Alternative Investment Market in the second or third
quarters of this year, the  Daily Mail  said.  No-one was immediately available to comment when Bloomberg
News called African Eagle’s offices in Zambia and Johannesburg
today seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
