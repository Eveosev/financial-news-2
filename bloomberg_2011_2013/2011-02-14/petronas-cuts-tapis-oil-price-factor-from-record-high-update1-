Petroliam Nasional Bhd. ,  Malaysia â€™s
state oil company, cut a price-adjustment factor for its
benchmark Tapis crude from a record high, reflecting a drop in
futures prices.  Petronas, as the Kuala Lumpur-based company is known, set
the factor at $5.80 a barrel for February, down $2, or 26
percent, from January, said an official today, asking not to be
identified because of corporate policy. The factor rose to a
record in each of the previous five months. It averaged $3.84
last year and 59 cents in 2009.  Oil has fallen more than 7 percent in  New York  this month
as concern eases that civil unrest in  Egypt  will disrupt Middle
East shipments. Tapis, a low-sulfur crude, is sold mainly to
refiners to be processed into gasoil, or diesel.  Petronas includes the adjustment factor in its formula for
calculating monthly official crude prices. The formula also
includes the average of twice-weekly assessments compiled by the
Asian Petroleum Price Index, a Hong Kong-based panel of traders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
