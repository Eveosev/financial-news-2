Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS, the Turkish
bank part-owned by  UniCredit SpA , said profit last year rose 53
percent in a filing for tax purposes only.  Net income increased to 2.06 billion liras ($1.29 billion)
from 1.35 billion liras in 2009, according to a statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  today. Earnings reported by Turkish
companies to the tax office aren’t necessarily indicative of
full earnings, made according to international reporting
standards.  “Implied fourth-quarter net profit is 281 million liras
versus our call of 371 million liras,” Duygun Kutucu, an
analyst at broker Ata Invest in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed
report to clients today. The earnings suggest a decline in
quarter-on-quarter earnings of 52 percent, Kutucu said.  Yapi Kredi may report earnings of 2.2 billion liras in its
full 2010 earnings compared with 1.35 billion liras in 2009,
according to the average estimate of 27 analysts questioned by
Bloomberg. Predictions ranged from 2.19 billion liras to 2.51
billion liras.  Interest income at Yapi Kredi, net of expenses, was 3.2
billion liras in 2010 compared with 3.48 billion liras the year
previously, the bank said in the tax filing. Net fees and
commission income was 1.6 billion liras compared with 1.44
billion liras in 2009, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
