gaining for a third day. The stainless-steel producer spun off
by ArcelorMittal would consider mergers in an industry that’s
beset by overcapacity and surging costs, Chief Executive Officer
Bernard Fontana said.    Eurocommercial Properties NV  (ECMPA NA) dropped 1.7 percent
to 34.11 euros, trimming Feb. 11’s rise. The Dutch owner of
shopping centers in France, Italy and Sweden had its

euros, the biggest drop this month. The maker of red coloring
for the wax coat on Edam cheese forecast second-half profit will

Route 66 launched a mapping and navigation application for
Google Inc.’s Android using TomTom’s maps.  “The Route 66 TomTom app is the first real android based
app for TomTom apart from its relationships with TeleNav and
HTC,” Martijn den Drijver at SNS Securities in Amsterdam wrote
in a note. “The financial impact will not be material but it
does suggest that TomTom could expand on the Android platform,
which is gaining in strength.”  Separately, TomTom announced a new PND for the Lancia
