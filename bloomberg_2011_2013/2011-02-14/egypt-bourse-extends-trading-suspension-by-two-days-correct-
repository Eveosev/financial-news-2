(Corrects to show exchange may open Feb. 20 in second
paragraph.)    Egypt ’s stock exchange, shut for
more than two weeks, extended a trading suspension by at least
two days after the central bank yesterday ordered banks to close
today.  The bourse will be closed until “banks return to normal
operation,” exchange spokesman Hisham Turk said in a telephone
interview. Trading was scheduled to resume Feb. 16 and may now
start Feb. 20.  Banks were shut today after protests by some employees and
will be closed for a public holiday tomorrow. Egypt’s benchmark
stocks index lost 16 percent in the week before the suspension.  “Some investors are growing frustrated because they want
access to their money,” said Hazem Choucri, foreign
institutional trader at Cairo-based AlembicHC. “But this is the
right move because it gives us time to see what happens. No one
wants to see the market plummet.”  Global depository receipts of Egyptian companies gained in  London , led by  Orascom Construction Industries , after the North
African country’s army dissolved parliament and vowed to hold
elections in six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
