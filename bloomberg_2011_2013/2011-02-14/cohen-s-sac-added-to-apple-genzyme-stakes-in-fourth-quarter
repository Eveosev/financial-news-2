  Steven A. Cohen ’s SAC Capital
Advisors LP boosted its shares of  Apple Inc . and  Genzyme Corp .,
two of the top five companies owned by the hedge fund.  SAC bought 553,336 shares of Apple, bringing the value of
shares it holds in the company to $282.7 million during the
fourth quarter of 2010, according to a filing today with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. SAC added 1.62 million
shares of Genzyme, according to the filing. The hedge fund owns
Genzyme shares valued at $463.2 million, the filings show.  Shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple rose 14 percent
in the last three months of 2010 as sales of its iPhone and iPad
devices increased. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Genzyme gained
0.6 percent during the quarter. Paris-based Sanofi-Aventis SA is
considering an acquisition of the drugmaker.  SAC Capital, founded by billionaire Cohen, today disclosed
$13 billion in U.S. stock assets.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange
Commission within 45 days of each quarter’s end to show their
U.S.-listed stocks, options and convertible bonds. The filings
don’t show non-U.S. securities or how much cash the firms hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
