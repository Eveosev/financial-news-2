The Conference Board’s index of U.S.
consumer confidence climbed to an almost three-year peak in
January, higher than previously estimated, reflecting changes in
sampling methodology.  The New York-based research group said today its sentiment
gauge rose to 65.6 last month, the highest level since March
2008 and up from the eight-month high of 60.6 previously
estimated.  In an e-mailed statement, the group said its data will now
be collected by New York-based Nielsen Holdings NV and will use
a “probability-design random sample” to determine who will be
surveyed. Reston, Virginia-based  TNS Inc ., which had been
collecting the data for the group since 1967, has discontinued
the program, Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board’s
consumer research center, said in a conference call with
reporters.  The Conference Board has been running parallel tests of
both sets of data for the past five months, and concluded the
two methods are consistent, Franco said on the call.  “There is not really a significant change in confidence
levels,” said Franco. The gauges “overall remain quite weak.”  The group revised the figures back to November using the
new sampling method and said prior data will not be changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Carlos Torres  at in Washington or
