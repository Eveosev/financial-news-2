The biggest floods in Queensland,
Australia, in half a century are turning into a windfall for
U.S. coal mining companies anticipating record profits and the
highest exports in 15 years.  Shipments from the U.S. are poised to rise 8.8 percent this
year to about 86.5 million tons, the most since 1996, the Energy
Department in  Washington  said Feb. 8. Demand for American coal
is increasing after floods devastated an area of Australia twice
the size of  Texas . Queensland’s combined output of steelmaking
and thermal coal may be reduced by 23 million metric tons, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch said in a Jan. 25 report. That’s about
13 percent of the state’s exports in the year ended in June.  Disruptions will drive the average price of U.S. Eastern
coal used to make steel up 13 percent to $254 a ton and the fuel
used in  power plants  to $74 a ton, 20 percent higher than a year
ago, according to the median of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey. That may spur a fivefold profit gain for  Alpha Natural
Resources Inc . and 75 percent for  Walter Energy Inc ., while
boosting President  Barack Obama ’s goal of doubling exports by
2014.  “Are we pushing the price? You’re damn straight we are,”
said Bob Pusateri, executive vice president of sales and
marketing at Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based  Consol Energy Inc .,
which operates 18 mines across six U.S. states. “If there is a
short-term phenomenon because of weather-related issues, the
coal companies are going to take advantage of it.”  Shipping Abroad  Producers across the U.S. are looking to ship coal abroad
as economic growth in  Asia  outpaces the rest of the world while
domestic use declines. Asian demand for steelmaking coal shipped
by sea will rise 3.6 percent this year to 171 million tons,
Arlington, Virginia-based FBR Capital Markets Inc. forecast on
Jan. 14. U.S. coal use is expected to drop 0.8 percent this
year, according to the Energy Department.  Production shortfalls in Asia are providing U.S. companies
with an advantage. Coking coal from  Australia  used to forge
steel sold for an average of $325 a metric ton in the week to
Feb. 4, exceeding the record $300 a ton set in 2008 when there
was also flooding, according to IHS McCloskey, a Petersfield,
England-based researcher.  Power station coal at the country’s Newcastle port, a
benchmark for Asia, has soared 44 percent since Jan. 1,
according to data from IHS McCloskey and Bloomberg.  Transport Bottlenecks  The biggest challenge for U.S. mining companies may be
getting coal from the mine to the train and moving it to the
port as railroads struggle to meet increased demand after they
furloughed employees and idled units because of the recession.    Norfolk Southern Corp . said it had 11,212 train and engine
employees in the fourth quarter, down about 7 percent from the
end of 2008. The railroad said it plans to  boost  headcount this
year.  CSX Corp ., the second-largest publicly traded U.S.
railroad, cut 1,882 employees, or 6.3 percent of its workforce,
since December 2007, according to Bloomberg data.  U.S.  exports  sank 29 percent to 80 million tons in 2010
from a record 112.5 million tons in 1981 as Australia dominated
world markets and prices slumped, according to U.S. Energy
Department data.  Rail carloads for coal rebounded 22 percent to 109,651 in
2010 from 89,465 in 2009, the lowest level in at least 16 years,
according to data from the Association of American Railroads. A
typical train car can hold 100 tons of coal.  Export Opportunities  “Rail, ports and producers need to get in sync and there’s
plenty of incentive for them to do so given where prices are,”
said Mike Dudas, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. Inc. in  New York ,
whose ratings on 21 commodity companies earned investors a 39
percent return in a year. “Additional exports north of 10
million tons seem like a reasonable expectation right now.”  In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, Obama
reiterated his goal of doubling U.S. exports in the next three
years to promote job growth as the country recovers from the
worst recession since the Great Depression. Unemployment has
been at least 9 percent for seven months, the longest stretch in
six decades.  Abingdon, Virginia-based Alpha may earn $4.32 a share this
year, up from the record $2.36 in 2008, and 80 cents last year,
according to the median of 11 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Walter’s profit may increase to $13.37, the data
show. Consol may earn $2.85 a share, a 78 percent increase from
a year earlier, and  International Coal Group Inc ., may have a
fourfold increase to a record 64 cents.  Alpha gained 26 percent in the past year to $55.34 a share.
Walter soared 66 percent to $127.09. Consol dropped 4 percent to
$47.41. International Coal more than doubled to $9.57.  Massey Takeover  The world’s appetite for coal is so great that  Massey Energy
Co ., the largest U.S. Central Appalachian producer, has had
trouble finding skilled workers.  “Qualified and experienced underground miners are in
increasingly high demand as prices for metallurgical coal
continue to rise,” the company said Feb. 1, noting that it
added two Saturday shifts until it can expand its workforce of
7,359 in December.  Alpha agreed on Jan. 29 to buy Massey for $8.5 billion,
including debt, 21 percent more than the share price at the
time, to create the world’s third-largest producer of
steelmaking coal.  Eager Customers  Scott Pack, president of coal sales at Alpha, said
customers are flying to visit him rather than the other way
around.  “We’re seeing this phenomena with all the producers to
work with the railroads and barge companies to get it to the
coast so that we can serve this growing need worldwide,” Pack
said in a telephone interview last month.  Coal on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  has gained 43
percent in the past year to $70.68 a ton as of Feb. 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. produced about 1.08 billion tons of coal in 2010,
according to Energy Department data. That’s set to climb 0.5
percent in 2011 to about 1.09 billion tons, the department said
in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook  on Feb. 8.  About 15 million to 20 million tons of coal may be lost
from Australia because of the flooding and that’s exacerbated by
inclement weather in  South Africa , Colombia and  Indonesia ,  Peabody Energy Corp . Chief Executive Officer Gregory Boyce said
on a Jan. 26 conference call. That’s about 0.3 percent of 2009’s
global coal production, according to Energy Department data.
Peabody is the largest U.S. coal producer.  Queensland’s Shortfall  The Queensland Resources Council estimates lost coal output
of at least 15 million tons. The floods covered an area the size
of France and  Germany  at their peak, swamping mines, railways
and damaging bridges.  Queensland’s coal exports rose 15 percent to a record 183.1
million tons in the 12 months ended June 30, underpinned by
demand from Asia, Andrew Fraser, the state’s treasurer, said in
August. This compares with 159.3 million tons the previous 12
months.  The BHP Billiton-Mitsubishi Alliance, known as BMA, the
world’s biggest exporter of coking coal, said on Jan. 20 that it
expects “an ongoing impact on production, sales and unit costs
for the remainder of the 2011 financial year,” ending in March
because of the flooding.  Demand for the fuel is part of a wider trend, said  David Khani , an analyst at FBR, whose ratings on eight coal companies
earned investors a 52 percent return in a year.  “We like to call it ‘coalbilization,’” Khani said. “All
of these things that are out of the norm are just exacerbating
the underlying trend, which is supply can’t keep up with demand.
What’s going on in Australia impacts what’s going on in Central
Appalachia and Northern Appalachia.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
