Tanzania’s benchmark coffee price
increased by 2.6 percent at an auction on Feb. 10, the Tanzania
Coffee Board said.  The average price for the top arabica AA rose to $308.22
for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $300.53 a week earlier,
the board said in an e-mailed statement today. The highest price
for the grade fell to $329.40 a bag, compared with a record $339
a bag, as supplies jumped 51 percent to 1,910 bags, it said.  Tanzania reaps its crop from April through August. Arabica
accounts for 75 percent of the nation’s output, with robusta
making up the rest.  Output in the 12 months through June may surge 54 percent
to 55,000 tons because of improved weather, Aldolph Kumburu, the
board’s director general, said on Aug. 3.  The following are details of the Feb. 10 auction in U.S.
