  Greece  will probably have to
restructure its debt as interest payments rise, Lars Feld, who
is joining Germany’s council of economic advisers, was quoted as
saying by the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  in an interview.  Feld said the preferred solution is for banks and other
creditors to extend the maturities of Greek sovereign bonds, the
Munich-based newspaper reported today.  Europe ’s banks are stable
enough and the euro will survive, Feld was cited as saying.  Feld, 44, head of the Freiburg-based Walter Eucken
Institute, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel’s council of economic
advisers on March 1, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
