Privately held business-to-business
publisher United Communications Group terminated an agreement to
sell its Oil Price Information Service unit to rival Platts.  Platts, an energy pricing, news and information unit of
McGraw-Hill Companies Inc., said in December that it would buy
OPIS as the company is known. Gaithersburg, Maryland-based OPIS
provides news and price information on wholesale and retail
petroleum markets.  “Since the initial announcement, our customers have
informed us of their opposition to this combination,” Brian
Crotty, chief executive officer of OPIS, said in statement
distributed Feb. 13 on  Business Wire . “In light of the concerns
expressed by our customers, we have notified Platts that we are
exercising our right to terminate the acquisition agreement.”  Bloomberg News and its parent company Bloomberg LP compete
with Platts in selling financial news and information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
