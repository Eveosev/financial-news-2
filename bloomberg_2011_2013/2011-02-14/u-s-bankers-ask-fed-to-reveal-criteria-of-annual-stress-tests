U.S. banking executives advised the  Federal Reserve  to share the criteria of stress tests while
leaving disclosure of results to individual firms, according to
a summary of a Feb. 4 meeting of the Federal Advisory Council.  The Dodd-Frank Act, a law passed last July that rewrote
financial regulations, requires the central bank to conduct
annual stress tests on banks with assets of over $10 billion.
Fed officials are reviewing the capital adequacy of the 19
largest U.S. banks. Stress tests model bank loan and securities
portfolio performance through both probable and adverse
scenarios.  The advisory council, a group of 12 bankers that meets with
the Fed  Board of Governors  four times a year, said regulators
should create “a high level of transparency” by “publicly
sharing criteria of  stress test  scenarios,” according to the
minutes released today by the central bank.  When the Fed conducts a stress test, it should publish a
“general summary” of results describing the capital adequacy
of the financial system and “no individual company results.”
The disclosure of company-performed stress tests should be at
“the discretion of each financial company,” the council
advised.  The council considered several other issues at the meeting,
including the implementation of the so-called Volcker Rule which
limits proprietary trading at banks and liquidity standards
proposed by an international regulatory accord known as Basel
III.  Volcker Rule  The bankers expressed concern that the Volcker Rule not
interfere with asset and liability management. They also said
Basel III’s 40 percent cap on U.S. agency securities held as a
component of a bank’s liquidity buffer “will make it difficult
to maintain an appropriately diversified portfolio of low risk
assets,” according to the minutes.  The bankers told the Fed that Dodd-Frank implementation
could create “additional and unintended burdens that make it
very difficult for financial institutions to serve customers,”
the minutes said.  All of the governors, including Fed Board Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and Daniel Tarullo, who is leading an internal overhaul
of bank supervision, attended the February meeting, according to
Fed spokeswoman  Michelle Smith .  Council members this year include Boston-based  State Street
Corp . Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph Hooley;
Pittsburgh-based  PNC Financial Services Group Inc . Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer James Rohr; and Minneapolis-based  US
Bancorp  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Davis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
