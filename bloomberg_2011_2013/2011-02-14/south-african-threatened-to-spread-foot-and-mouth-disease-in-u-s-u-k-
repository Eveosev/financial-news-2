A 64-year-old South African man
facing a charge of terrorism for threatening to release foot-
and-mouth disease in the U.K. and U.S. didn’t have the means to
follow through with the threat, South African prosecutors said.  It is the first time  South Africa  is seeking the
prosecution of someone for making terrorist threats,  Mthunzi
Mhaga, a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority, told
reporters outside the Johannesburg court where the man will be
appearing. The man, who hasn’t yet been publicly identified, is
also facing a charge of  money laundering , he said.  The South African businessman was arrested in a sting
operation after a six-month investigation carried out in
collaboration with the London Metropolitan Police Counter
Terrorism Command and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation,
according to the police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
