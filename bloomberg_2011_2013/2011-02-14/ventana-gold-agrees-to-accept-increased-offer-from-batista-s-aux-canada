Brazilian Billionaire  Eike Batista ’s
AUX Canada Acquisition Inc. reached a verbal agreement to buy
about 80 percent of gold explorer  Ventana Gold Corp . in a deal
that values the company at C$1.54 billion ($1.56 billion).  AUX will acquire all of the remaining shares in Ventana
that it doesn’t already own for C$13.06 apiece in cash, Ventana
said today in a statement. The offer represents a 34 percent
premium above the 20-day volume-weighted average trading price
through Nov. 16, the day before Batista offered C$12.63 a share,
according to the statement.  The deal will give Batista 100 percent of Ventana and
access to 3.5 million ounces of gold, as well as silver and
copper deposits in Colombia. Batista, who is planning to sell
shares in a Colombian  coal mine , follows Anglo American Plc, BHP
Billiton Ltd. and Xstrata Plc, in tapping the nation’s metal
reserves at a time of near-record  gold prices .  Carlos Slim , the
world’s richest person according to Forbes Magazine, said last
week that he is seeking to boost his investments in  Colombia 
because of the country’s open policy on commodities investment.  Ventana rose 4.8 percent to C$12.85 in Toronto trading as
of 11:01 a.m. New York time, after earlier surging as much as
5.2 percent, the most since Nov. 17.  AUX said Jan. 21 that it would extend its previous C$12.63
offer, which valued Ventana at about C$1.5 billion on a fully
diluted basis, until Feb. 15. In December, AUX said Ventana had
about 118.3 million shares taking into account convertible
securities.  Board Rejection  Ventana’s board recommended Dec. 23 that its shareholders
reject the previous unsolicited takeover bid, saying it
undervalued the company. At the time, Ventana said Batista had
already been prepared to bid C$13.06 a share if the board agreed
to the offer. Ventana repeated as recently as Feb. 8 that it was
in talks with third parties to “surface a superior
alternative” to the Batista offer, without providing names of
these possible bidders.  “Good luck to them,” Batista said last week when asked
about other possible bidders for the miner. The billionaire, who
bought his first gold mine at 24, was Ventana’s biggest
shareholder through its Cayman-based 63X Master Fund with about
20 percent as of Dec. 21, according to a  document  distributed by
Ventana.  Ventana’s Deposit  Ventana owns  La Bodega , a deposit 400 kilometers northeast
of Bogota that contains estimated resources of 3.5 million
ounces of gold, 19.2 million ounces of silver and 84.6 million
ounces of copper, according to the company’s  website . The
project has the potential to produce 301,000 ounces of gold a
year for its first six years of production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
