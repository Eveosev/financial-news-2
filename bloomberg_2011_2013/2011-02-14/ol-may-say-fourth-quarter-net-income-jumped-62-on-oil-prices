Mol Nyrt.,  Hungary â€™s largest
refiner, may say fourth-quarter profit rose 62 percent from a
year earlier as higher crude  oil prices  and the bigger
proportion of offshore gas produced increase margins.  Net income for the period was probably 44.1 billion forint
after a profit of 27.3 billion forint a year earlier, according
to the median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
The estimates were for 22.8 billion forint to 57.3 billion
forint.  Mol is due to publish earnings Feb. 12 in Budapest. The
following table shows the estimates and year-earlier results.
The figures are in billions of forint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
