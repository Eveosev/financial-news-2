Grosvenor Group Ltd., the real
estate company owned by the family trust of Britain’s Duke of Westminster, raised 125 million pounds ($201 million) through a  bond issue  to invest in its properties.  The company, which owns 300 acres (121 hectares) of
properties in London’s Mayfair and Belgravia districts, issued
20-year and 30-year unsecured loan notes in a private placement
to investors based in London and the U.S.  “We felt this was a good moment to raise longer-term
finance at historically competitive rates, and in maturities
that would extend the company’s debt maturity profile,” said
Peter Vernon, chief executive officer of Grosvenor for Britain
and Ireland.  Property companies are seeking alternative sources of
finance after bank lending declined following the credit crisis,
Roger Blundell, finance director for Britain and Ireland, said
by telephone.  “It’s challenging out there at the moment,” he said.
“Banks still have significant real estate loan books they are
reducing by a lot. A lot of the bigger real estate firms like us
will look at different types of financing.”  Bank debt secured by real estate totaled 243 billion pounds
in mid-2010, according to a report last month by industry group
the Property Industry Alliance.  The issue was fully denominated in pounds and priced on
Feb. 11 to yield 5.69 percent. It consists of 95 million pounds
of notes maturing in 2031 with a coupon of 5.57 percent and 30
million pounds maturing in 2041 with a coupon of 6.05 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
