Guinea wants more information on the
planned $7 billion mining and infrastructure investment by the  China  Investment Fund, according to Guillaume Curtis, general
secretary of the African nation’s Ministry of Mines.  Guinea plans to review the investment that was agreed in
2009,  Eco-Vision  reported earlier today, citing Curtis.  “We did not say that we will review this deal or not,” he
said by phone today from the capital, Conakry. “The problem is
that we haven’t got any information about it.”  China may invest as much as $9 billion in Guinean
infrastructure over the next five years, Mines Minister  Mahmoud Thiam  said on Oct. 13, 2009.  Guinea holds as much as half of the world’s reserves of
bauxite, a raw material used in aluminum production. It also
holds more than 4 billion metric tons of “high-grade”  iron
ore , “significant” diamond and gold deposits, and undetermined
quantities of uranium, according to the website of the U.S.
State Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
