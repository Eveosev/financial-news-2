  India ’s 11-year bonds, the most-
traded government debt, rose the most in more than two weeks
after inflation slowed in January.  The wholesale-price index rose 8.23 percent from a year
earlier after an 8.43 percent jump in December, the commerce
ministry said in a statement in New Delhi today. The central
bank raised its benchmark  interest rates  seven times in the past
year to damp inflation, the most of any monetary authority in  Asia .  “The deceleration in inflation is a silver lining,” said  Roy Paul , Mumbai-based deputy general manager at Federal Bank
Ltd. “I think expectations of more rate hikes will keep the
gains in check.”  The yield on the 8.08 percent note due August 2022 dropped
five basis points to 8.19 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The repurchase auction rate, at which lenders borrow
overnight from the  Reserve Bank , is 6.5 percent. The next policy
review is scheduled on March 17.  India’s “problem” of inflation continues to be
challenging, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Ten Indian state governments plan to raise a total 70.88
billion rupees ($1.6 billion) selling 10-year debt at an auction
tomorrow, the central bank said in an e-mailed statement on Feb.
11.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
was little changed at 7.47 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
