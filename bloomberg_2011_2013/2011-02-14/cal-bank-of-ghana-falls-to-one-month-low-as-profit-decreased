  Cal Bank Ltd ., a lender in  Ghana ,
fell to the lowest in a month as full-year profit declined.  The stock fell 1 pesewa, or 2.9 percent, to 34 pesewas by
the 3 p.m. close in Accra, the capital. It was the lowest since
Jan. 11.  “Some investors were expecting profit to increase in 2010,
just to know it rather decreased,” Enyonam Dagadu, a trader
with African Alliance Securities Ghana Ltd. said by phone from
Accra. Cal Bank’s  profit  for the year to Dec. 31 slowed to 8.06
million cedis ($5.3 million), from 8.3 million cedis the year
before, the bank said in a statement on the Ghana Stock Exchange
website today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
