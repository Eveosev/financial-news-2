The panel authorized by Congress to
investigate the financial crisis published the transcript of a
2009 interview with Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
after initially saying it would be withheld.  The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission  posted  the 89-page
transcript on its website today. Tucker Warren, a spokesman for
the panel, said the Fed agreed late Feb. 11 to its publication.
The session was initially withheld because it was considered
confidential. The panel later sought and received the Fed’s
agreement to make it public, he said.  In a Feb. 11 article, Bloomberg News quoted Warren as
saying the FCIC was withholding records when there was “legal
or proprietary information in those interviews that meant they
could not be made public,” or no audio, transcript or summary
exists. The FCIC on Feb. 10 released more than 300 witness
interviews.    Michelle Smith , a spokeswoman for the Fed, declined to
comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
