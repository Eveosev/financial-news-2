Business Secretary Vince Cable said
he expects Britain’s  Independent Commission on Banking  will lead
to “radical surgery” to protect banks’ retail arms from the
activities of their investment units.  Cable, a Liberal Democrat member of the Conservative-led
government, said in a Bloomberg Television interview that
ministers had appointed to the commission “expert surgeons”
whose conclusions would trigger “greater competition and some
form of break-up or separation of the different activities of
the banks.”  ICB chairman  John Vickers , an Oxford University professor
and former Bank of England chief economist, said on Jan. 22 that
he was examining the ring-fencing, or subsidiarization, of
investment and consumer-banking units, while ruling out a full
break-up.  Barclays Plc ,  HSBC Holdings Plc  and  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc  all oppose such a move.  “The reason why rich bankers are in a different position
from footballers and racing drivers is that they’re dependent on
a taxpayer guarantee,” Cable said late Feb. 11. He said that
his goal for banks was “if there is a casino arm and it’s
standing alone, it can then operate as a hedge fund and it can
go bust. It’s going to require radical surgery.”  The five-member inquiry is halfway through its examination
of the industry. The review seeks to increase competition and
financial stability. It will report to Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  in September.  “There’s been a certain amount of tension in the debate,”
Cable said. “I’m pretty certain the government will follow
their advice.”  Barclays Chief Executive Officer  Bob Diamond  said last
month that the “the integrated, universal banking model is
safer and sounder and better for jobs and economic growth.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
