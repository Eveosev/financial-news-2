Oil tumbled in  New York  to the
lowest level since November amid an abundance of fuel in the
U.S. and as tensions eased in  Egypt  after the ouster last week
of President  Hosni Mubarak .  Crude dropped 0.9 percent after the Egyptian army dissolved
parliament and suspended the constitution yesterday to meet
opposition demands. U.S. total fuel supplies have risen every
week this year as gasoline stocks climbed to a 20-year high and
oil at Cushing,  Oklahoma , reached a record in January. Prices
also fell after breaking technical support at $85.11 a barrel.  “There’s a considerable fundamental overhang in this
market, and as the geopolitical premium bleeds out, it’s going
to be difficult for the market to maintain these levels,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based
hedge fund that focuses on energy. Oil below $85.11 is “back in
the congestion zone from October and November of last year.”  Crude oil for March delivery fell 77 cents to settle at
$84.81 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
level since Nov. 30. Futures are up 14 percent from a year ago.
Oil for April delivery dropped 40 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$88.73.  Gasoline inventories rose 4.66 million barrels in the week
ended Feb. 4 to 240.9 million, the highest level since March
1990, according to the Energy Department.  U.S. Supply  “The inventory numbers tell a rather compelling bearish
fundamental story,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi
Futures Perspective in New York. “We have a higher price from a
year ago with more oil.”  Stockpiles of crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery
point for New York futures, fell 927,000 barrels to 37.4
million.  The oil market is “well supplied,” though OPEC producers
are ready to provide more crude to consumers as demand grows,
Mohamed al-Hamli, oil minister from the  United Arab Emirates ,
said today in  Abu Dhabi . “Signs are coming, and they are
positive, that there will be a gradual increase in demand.”  The Egyptian army, which assumed power after Mubarak’s
ouster Feb. 11, told protesters it will respond to their demands
by the end of the week, Ahmed Maher, a co-founder of the Six of
April opposition group said today. His organization is part of
the Revolution’s Youth Coalition, the group that helped
orchestrate the street protests that started Jan. 25.  Dollar Strengthens  Oil also fell as the dollar rose to a three-week high
against the euro, curbing commodities’ appeal as an alternative
investment, as European finance ministers ruled out immediate
steps to tackle the debt crisis.  The dollar gained 0.5 percent to $1.3482 per euro at 3:19
p.m. in New York. Earlier, it touched $1.3428, the highest level
since Jan. 20.  Futures climbed earlier as much as 1.1 percent on a report
that Chinese exports surged, signaling that demand is growing in
the world’s biggest energy-consuming country. Oil also climbed
as  Brent crude  in  London  reached the highest price since 2008.  China’s customs bureau said exports climbed 38 percent in
January from a year before.  China  also boosted net crude-oil
imports to the highest level in four months in January as demand
for  diesel fuel  to operate irrigation in drought-stricken
regions rose.  Net imports reached 21.5 million metric tons, or 5.1
million barrels a day, data from the Beijing-based General
Administration of Customs showed today.  Brent Rises  Brent crude for April settlement gained $2.14, or 2.1
percent, to $103.08 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange, the highest price since Sept. 26, 2008. The
March contract expired on Feb. 11 at $101.43.  Brent has outpaced New York futures, widening the
difference between the prices for April delivery to more than
$14 a barrel, as unplanned outages cut European supplies.  Gasoline for March delivery gained 5.22 cents, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $2.5174 a gallon, and heating oil for
March climbed 5.46 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.7504 a gallon.  “The products are following Brent,” said Carl Larry,
president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “The
products are deliverable in New York Harbor, and the refineries
that supply it run mostly on imported crude.”  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 794,062
contracts as of 3:19 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 959,387
contracts Feb. 11, 32 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.56 million contracts, the
highest level since Sept. 12, 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
