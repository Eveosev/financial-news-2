European Union carbon allowances
declined after reaching their highest level in 11 days.  EU emission permits for December fell 0.3 percent to 14.84
euros ($19.98) a metric ton on  London â€™s ICE Futures Europe
exchange as of 9:08 a.m. They earlier rose as high as 14.97
euros a ton, the highest intraday price since Feb. 3.  German power for next year dropped 0.6 percent to 51.70
euros a megawatt-hour, according to prices from brokers. U.K.
natural gas for the six months through September fell 1.8
percent to 52.3 pence a therm on ICE.  Power utilities need about half the permits when burning
gas instead of coal. Carbon prices can track power because lower
electricity rates will cut the incentive to generate and sell in
forward markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
