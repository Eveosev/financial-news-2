A group of phone operators has drawn
up the requirements for a standard embedded Subscriber
Information Module, or SIM, card to be used in mobile devices,
the GSM Association said in a statement today.  The proposed standard would cover a SIM card that could be
sealed in devices, including machinery that isnâ€™t mobile, the
GSMA said. Under the standard, the SIM card may be remotely
updated to change the operator or other information without
removing it, according to the statement.  SIM cards identify the customer account and handle the
connection with the wireless network. Proposed applications for
the embedded wireless SIM cards include consumer electronics,
automobile systems, healthcare equipment, and energy meters, the
GSMA said.  The proposal will be submitted to the telecommunications
standards body ETSI this month, the GSMA said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
