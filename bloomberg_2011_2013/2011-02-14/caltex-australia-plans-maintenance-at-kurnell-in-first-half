  Caltex Australia Ltd ., the nationâ€™s
biggest oil refiner, plans maintenance on a fluid catalytic
cracking unit at its Kurnell plant in New South Wales in the
first half of the year, according to a spokesman Sam Collyer.  A report by the Australian Financial Review of maintenance
being conducted at the Lytton refinery in Queensland is
incorrect, Collyer said by telephone today. He declined to
comment further on the timing and duration of the work at
Kurnell, south of Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
