Former All-Star outfielder Andruw Jones signed a one-year contract with the  New York Yankees  as
the team began heading to spring training.  Financial terms weren’t disclosed today in a Yankees news
release announcing the accord. The agreement is worth $2 million
and Jones can earn up to $1.2 million more in performance
incentives, the Associated Press reported on Jan. 20.  Jones, a five-time All-Star who’s won 10 Gold Gloves for
his defense, had 51 home runs with 128 runs batted in for the  Atlanta Braves  in 2005 to lead the National League in both
categories.  He hit 41 home runs the next season and 26 in 2007, the
last of his 12 years with the Braves. Jones had an injury-
plagued season for the  Los Angeles Dodgers  in 2008 and another
with the Texas Rangers in 2009. Last season, he batted .230 with
19 home runs and 48 RBIs for the Chicago White Sox. He has a
career .256 batting average.  In New York, the 33-year-old will join an outfield that
includes  Brett Gardner , Curtis Granderson and Nick Swisher.  Today is the voluntary spring training reporting date for
pitchers, catchers and injured players, while position players
can arrive beginning Feb. 19. The mandatory reporting date for
all players is Feb. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
