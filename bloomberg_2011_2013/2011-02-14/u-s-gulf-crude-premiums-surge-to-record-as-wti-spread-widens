U.S. Gulf crudes surged to record
premiums as the spread between West  Texas  Intermediate for March
and April deliveries widened.  The spread between March and April-delivery WTI futures
widened to $4 at 12:32 p.m. in  New York  from a settlement of
$3.55 a barrel Feb. 11. The spread between April-delivery WTI
futures and Brent, the basis for European and West African
crudes, narrowed $1.65 to $14.20 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium strengthened $1.90 to a
record $19.40 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI surged $2.15 to $19.50.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI strengthened $2.25 to $13.50 a barrel, while
Poseidon increased $2.25 to $13.75 over the benchmark.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened $1.65 to $11.65 a
barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI strengthened $1.75 a
barrel to $18.50 a barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 35
cents to $7. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is
less influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium increased $2.25 to at $8.25 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed $3.50 a
barrel to $19.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
