  Sprint Nextel Corp . said the craze
for tablet computers in the U.S., led by  Apple Inc .’s iPad, will
temper as competition forces more than half of manufacturers to
abandon the market in the next two years.  “You’ll probably have a good dozen players by the end of
this year, and then in two years you’ll probably see just five
that are really playing in the space,” Fared Adib, vice
president of product development for Sprint, said in an
interview in Barcelona today.  Sprint, the third-largest U.S. wireless-service provider,
will introduce the  Research In Motion Ltd . PlayBook tablet this
year and is already selling the Samsung Electronics Co. Galaxy
Tab. The carrier has said it will begin selling a third tablet
this year that will work on its so-called fourth-generation
network, which offers faster Web browsing and video downloads.  A number of tablets are “essentially a phone operating
system on a tablet,” rather than devices with software and
features to take full advantage of the tablet format, Adib said.
He said the Overland Park, Kansas-based carrier is considering
other tablets that use  Google Inc .’s Android software, in
addition to the Galaxy Tab.  Sprint fell 9 cents to $4.52 at 11:22 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. It had added 8.7 percent this
year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
