South African stocks rose for a
second day, sending the benchmark index to an all-time high, as
metals prices climbed on an unexpected increase in  China ’s
copper imports.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index rallied as much as 1.2
percent to 33,334.55, and traded 0.4 percent higher at 3:05 p.m.
in Johannesburg.  BHP Billiton Plc , the world’s largest mining
company, gained 1.6 percent, while  Anglo American Plc  advanced
0.9 percent.  “Psychologically this is a great move because it means
there’s a bit of money being put in the market,” said Patrick Mathidi, a portfolio manager with MMI Asset Management. “In
terms of valuations, I wouldn’t rush in to the market at this
stage. Diversified resources, like Anglo American and  BHP
Billiton , are the one place to hide.”  Copper imports by China rebounded 5.7 percent in January
from the previous month as fabricators increased stockpiles
ahead of a seasonal ramp up in production after the Lunar New
Year. Copper climbed 1.6 percent on the London Metal Exchange.
Lead, nickel, tin and zinc also gained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
