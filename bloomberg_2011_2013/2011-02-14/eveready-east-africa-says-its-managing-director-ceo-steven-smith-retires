  Eveready East Africa Ltd .’s Chief
Executive Officer and Managing Director  Steven Smith  will retire
at the end of May after 13 years as head of the Kenyan dry-cell
battery maker.  A short-list of candidates has been drawn up and a
replacement will probably be known within the next month, Smith
said by phone from Nairobi, the capital.  The stock shed 5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 2.6 shilling by
2 p.m. in Nairobi.  “Smith has been instrumental in the growth of the company
but new leadership may come with some innovations and bring in
new products,” Mbuthia Irungu, a trader with Nairobi-based
Genghis Capital Ltd., said by phone.  The company on Dec. 7 reported net income fell 69 percent
to 8.7 million shillings ($107,780) in the year through
