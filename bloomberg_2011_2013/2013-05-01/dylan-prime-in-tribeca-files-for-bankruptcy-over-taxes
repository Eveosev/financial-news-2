Dylan Prime , a steakhouse in  New
York ’s Tribeca neighborhood, filed for bankruptcy after being
closed by the city last month for failing to pay sales taxes.  The restaurant, owned by LKS Concepts LLC, will reopen in
about three months with money from new investors, John Mautone,
an LKS managing partner, said today in a phone interview.  A deal had been pending for five months when the city’s
Department of Taxation and Finance padlocked the premises at 62
Laight Street on April 3, Mautone said. The restaurant owed more
than $741,000 in  sales tax  as of that date, according to court
papers. Mautone, who owns 51 percent of LKS, said he will remain
involved with the new group.  “We’ve been here for 13 years,” Mautone said.
“Management will remain the same, most of the staff will be
back, but we’ll probably seek a new leader in the kitchen.”  Dylan Prime listed assets of $62,200 and debt of
$2.2 million in Chapter 11 documents filed yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in  Manhattan . Its largest unsecured creditor is
listed as landlord E&G Realty, owed about $1.4 million.  The restaurant had 49 employees, according to court papers.  The case is In re LKS Concepts LLC, 13-bk-11390,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
