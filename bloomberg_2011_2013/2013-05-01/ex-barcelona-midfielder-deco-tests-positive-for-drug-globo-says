Former Barcelona midfielder Deco Souza
tested positive for a banned drug after playing for Rio de
Janeiro team Fluminense against Botafogo on March 30,  the O
Globo newspaper  reported.  Globo cited Deco’s spokesman Acaz Felleger as saying the
diuretic, furosemide, was in a vitamin supplement the player
took. Deco was left out of Fluminense’s trip to a Libertadores
Cup match in Ecuador tomorrow, Globo added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
