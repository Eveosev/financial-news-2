West Texas Intermediate oil fell for a
second day on signs of economic slowdown in the U.S. and  China 
and after an industry group said U.S. stockpiles climbed for the
first time in three weeks.  Futures dropped as much as 3 percent as ADP Research
Institute said U.S. companies added fewer workers than forecast
in April and China’s manufacturing expanded at a weaker pace in
April. Crude inventories rose by 5.18 million barrels last week,
the  American Petroleum Institute  said. The Energy Information
Administration may report a gain of 1.1 million barrels,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  “The ADP number is quite disappointing and the Chinese
manufacturing report is really weighing on this market,” said
Bill Baruch, a senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in
 Chicago . “The API reported a quite big build. It’s pulling the
market down.”  WTI for June delivery retreated $2.60, or 2.8 percent, to
$90.86 a barrel at 9:20 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. The volume of all futures traded was 32 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day. Prices were down 3.9
percent last month.  Brent for June settlement slid $2.47, or 2.4 percent, to
$99.90 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Volume was 16 percent above the 100-day average. Brent’s premium
to WTI decreased to as small as $8.39, the narrowest since
January 2012.  ADP Report  U.S. companies added 119,000 jobs last month, the smallest
since September, figures from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
showed today. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg projected a 150,000 advance. The April number followed
a revised 131,000 gain in March that was smaller than initially
estimated.  China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was at 50.6, the
National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said today. That compared with the 50.7  median
forecast  of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and a March
reading of 50.9.  The U.S. and China are the world’s two biggest oil
consuming countries, together using 32 percent of global oil in
2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.
The U.S. consumed 21 percent.  Crude Stockpiles  U.S. crude inventories climbed 1.4 percent to 388.4 million
barrels in the week ended April 26, the API said. The API
collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis from
operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical unit, for its weekly survey.  Daily output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries increased in April by 194,000 barrels a day to 30.9
million barrels, a separate Bloomberg survey indicated.  Saudi
Arabia , the group’s biggest producer, increased daily output by
80,000 barrels to 9.18 million.  “With inventories at the levels they are at, it is a
question of how much demand there is, and there is growing
evidence of a slowdown in economic activity with even China
weaker than expected,” said  Michael Hewson , a market analyst at
CMC Markets Plc in  London . “The direction of travel on oil is
down and I see no reason to change that view unless OPEC cuts
production.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
