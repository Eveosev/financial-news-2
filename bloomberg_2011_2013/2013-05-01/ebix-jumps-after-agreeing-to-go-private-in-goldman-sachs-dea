Ebix Inc. (EBIX)  jumped to its highest price
in almost six months and topped a $20-a-share takeover bid from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that would take the supplier of
insurance software and services private.  Shares of  Ebix rose  as much as 14 percent to $21.25, the
highest intraday since Nov. 5, before settling to $20.52 at
10:43 a.m. in  New York . Goldman Sachs agreed to pay 18 percent
more than the average daily closing price for the last 30 days,
Atlanta-based Ebix said today in a statement.  The agreement includes a 45-day window where Ebix can
solicit other offers, according to the statement. Ebix said its
special committee of independent directors unanimously supported
the Goldman Sachs bid, which the companies valued at $820
million including assumption of outstanding debt.  “We have great respect for Ebix and its strong commitment
to providing customers with the highest quality of software and
e-commerce services in the  insurance industry ,” Sumit Rajpal, a
managing director at New York-based Goldman Sachs, said in the
statement. “We look forward to working with the company and
helping it maximize its growth potential.”  Ebix said in March that 2012  net income  fell 1 percent to
$70.6 million as revenue increased 18 percent to $199.4 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
