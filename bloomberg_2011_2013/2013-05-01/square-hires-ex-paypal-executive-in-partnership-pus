Square Inc. the mobile-payments
startup founded by Twitter Inc. Chairman Jack Dorsey, has hired
Alex Petrov as vice president of partnerships.  Petrov will be charged with driving strategic business
development and customer acquisition, San Francisco-based Square
said in a statement today. He was most recently vice president
of retail marketing at  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal unit.  Last month, Square announced the hiring of former Google
Inc. executive Francoise Brougher as the company’s business
lead, overseeing areas including customer support, partnerships
and international expansion.  Both executive additions follow the departure of Chief
Operating Officer Keith Rabois in January. The company has
unveiled partnerships with  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  and Blue Bottle
Coffee in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
