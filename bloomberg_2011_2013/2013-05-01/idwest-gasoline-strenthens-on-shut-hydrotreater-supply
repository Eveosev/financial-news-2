Midwest gasoline and diesel
strengthened to a  two-month high  versus futures as a
hydrotreater shut at a  Minnesota  refinery and regional gasoline
supplies slumped the most since 2008.  Flint Hills Resources Inc. idled a distillate hydrotreater
after an “event” at its 330,000-barrel-a-day Pine Bend,
Minnesota, refinery April 27, said Brent Rohne, a pollution
control specialist with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
A hydrotreater removes sulfur from refined products.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and BP Plc are conducting maintenance at
the Joliet, Illinois, and Whiting,  Indiana , plants.  Stockpiles of gasoline in the Midwest, known as PADD 2,
slipped 2.51 million barrels to  50 million  in the week ended
April 26, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported
today. Refineries utilized 84.5 percent of capacity, the lowest
seasonal level since at least 2010.  Conventional gasoline  in the Group 3 region strengthened
3.38 cents to 2.25 cents a gallon above futures on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 2:40 p.m. That’s the highest level since
Feb. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ultra-low-
sulfur diesel fuel in the group gained 3.87 cents to a 6.75-cent
premium. Group 3, located in PADD 2, stretches north from Tulsa,
Oklahoma, to Minnesota and  North Dakota .  The  3-2-1 crack  spread in Group 3, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
Oklahoma, increased 79 cents to $26.07 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
