Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  sold a
majority stake in its reinsurance business to institutions and
high-net worth clients as financial firms adjust to demands by
regulators for more capital.  Goldman Sachs is keeping a minority stake in the business,
named Global Atlantic Financial Group, the New York-based bank
said today in a statement. The firm didn’t disclose the price of
the private offering or what percentage it retained.  Chief Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz said in January
that the bank was considering selling a stake in the business
because international regulators are imposing higher  capital
requirements . The bank at that time disclosed the unit’s
contribution for the first time, saying revenue climbed 23
percent in 2012 to $1.08 billion.  The division has a global property and casualty reinsurance
business as well as life and annuity reinsurance operations
primarily in the U.S. Goldman Sachs agreed in 2012 to buy Ariel
Holdings Ltd.’s Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance
businesses to expand property and casualty coverage.  The bank said last month that reinsurance revenue was $233
million in the first quarter, up from $211 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
