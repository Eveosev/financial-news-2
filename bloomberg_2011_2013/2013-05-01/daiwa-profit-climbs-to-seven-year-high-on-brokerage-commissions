Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) ,  Japan ’s
second-biggest brokerage, boosted the bonus pool for its
investment bankers and staff to the most in three years after
posting its highest profit since 2006.  Daiwa increased funds set aside for June payouts by 83
percent to 22 billion yen ($226 million), according to the
Tokyo-based company’s statement yesterday. Fourth-quarter net
income more than quadrupled to 48.8 billion yen, surpassing the
25 billion yen average of 11 analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg, as commissions and underwriting fees jumped.  The Japanese bank joins companies from Toyota Motor Corp.
to  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  in planning to raise compensation as a weakening
yen boosts corporate earnings. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s push
to end deflation has spurred a market rally that led to the best
month since 1999 for equity investors in Japan and bolstered
profit for rival  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  It may also lead to
average payouts of $16,400 next month for Daiwa staff.  “Bonuses in the securities industry swing wildly according
to business performance, so it makes sense that Daiwa would
raise the amount,” said Natsumu Tsujino, a Tokyo-based analyst
at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “Having said that, it’s a bit of a
surprise as their performance had been bad until recently and
they’re cutting staff overseas.”  Chief Executive Officer Takashi Hibino, 57, is expanding
the bonus pool even as he implements a program to eliminate 70
billion yen of expenses by March 2015.  Goldman Pay  Staffing costs slid 0.8 percent to 157 billion yen for the
year ended March 31, Daiwa’s earnings statement showed. That’s
about $117,000 per person, including administrative employees
and senior executives at all its units. New York-based Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.’s 2012 compensation expense, which includes
salaries, bonuses, benefits and deferred awards, equated to
about $399,500 per employee, based on figures on its website.  Daiwa pays bonuses to employees twice a year, and its
spending may vary from the amount set aside. The firm had
reserved 14.5 billion yen for the December bonus, and 12 billion
yen for June 2012. It doesn’t disclose the amount paid, while
Nomura doesn’t report the size of its bonus pool.  “We set aside an appropriate amount after talking with
auditors,” Daiwa Chief Financial Officer Mikita Komatsu said in
a press briefing in  Tokyo . The firm will decide on the final
amount after talks with its employees’ labor union, he said.  It employed 13,759 staff as of March 31, indicating a
reduction of 102 positions from December.  Stimulus Boost  Shares of Daiwa fell 1.3 percent to 858 yen at 10:25 a.m.
in Tokyo as the Topix declined 0.3 percent after reports showed
U.S. manufacturing and hiring slowed. Daiwa and Nomura have
jumped about 160 percent in the past six months as fiscal and
monetary stimulus fueled trading of Japanese stocks and spurred
companies to tap bond and equity markets for financing.  “Daiwa has wind in its sails,” said Katsunori Tanaka, a
Tokyo-based analyst at Goldman Sachs. “Their strategy to focus
on the mother market and retail business is well matched to the
current market conditions.”  The securities firm raised its second-half  dividend  to 12
yen from 3 yen. Revenue increased 53 percent from a year earlier
to 172.8 billion yen, it said.  Brokerage commissions climbed 75 percent to 20.6 billion
yen. Trading profit increased 55 percent to 45.9 billion yen.
Underwriting fees tripled to 8.5 billion yen.  More Underwriting  Banks have managed 1.73 trillion yen of equity offerings in
Japan this year, the most since 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Corporate bond sales climbed to 3.2 trillion yen,
the best start to a year since 2009.  Daiwa was the No. 1 underwriter of Japanese equity
offerings last quarter, arranging transactions valued at 367.5
billion yen including the government’s sale of shares in  Japan
Tobacco Inc. (2914) , the data show. It was ranked fifth in bond
underwriting and No. 14 in advice on mergers and acquisitions
involving Japanese companies.  Pretax loss from overseas operations narrowed to 385
million yen for the three months ended March 31, from 2.6
billion yen a year earlier, the brokerage said yesterday.  Nomura’s net income more than tripled to 82.4 billion yen
last quarter, also led by brokerage commissions and  investment
banking , the Tokyo-based company said on April 26. The result
exceeded the 56 billion yen average estimate of nine analysts.  Prime Minister Abe has been urging Japanese companies to
increase salaries to help defeat more than a decade of deflation
that has hobbled the world’s third-largest  economy .  Toyota agreed in March to raise its annual average bonus by
16 percent to about 2.05 million yen, the biggest in five years,
after the world’s largest automaker boosted its profit forecast.
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-largest bank by
market value, said in March that it will increase its annual
bonus pool for the first time in five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
