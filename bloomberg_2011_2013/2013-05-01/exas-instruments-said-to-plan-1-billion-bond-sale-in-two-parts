Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) , one of four
companies to have sold three-year debt at a record-low 0.45
percent coupon, borrowed $1 billion in a two-part offering.  The largest maker of analog semiconductors issued equal
$500 million portions of 1 percent, five-year notes that pay 55
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and 2.25
percent, 10-year bonds with a relative yield of 85, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds from the sale will be used
to repay debt including its $500 million of 0.875 percent notes
maturing May 15, Dallas-based Texas Instruments said today in a
regulatory filing.  Its $750 million of 1.65 percent bonds due 2019 traded at
100.3 cents on the dollar yesterday to yield 1.6 percent, or
49.7 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The company sold its $750 million of three-year debt with
the lowest coupon in July. That rateâ€™s been matched by Apple
Inc.,  Unilever NV (UNA)  and Walt Disney Co., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
