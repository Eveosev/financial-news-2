Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s global head of
rates sales Haroon Sana is leaving the company, according to
three people with knowledge of the matter.  Sana will depart his London-based role at  Germany ’s biggest
bank later this year, said two of the people, who asked not to
be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak on the
matter. Prior to joining Deutsche Bank, Sana worked for Morgan
Stanley and Merrill Lynch & Co., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Paul Swaddling, head of hedge fund sales for rates, has
left the company, two of the people said today.  Sebastian Howell, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in  London ,
declined to comment on Sana’s and Swaddling’s positions when
reached by phone. Sana wasn’t immediately available to comment.  Deutsche Bank said on April 29 that pretax profit at the
investment bank fell 2 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier to 1.85 billion euros ($2.4 billion). Cost reductions
failed to offset a 4 percent decline in revenue to 4.6 billion
euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
