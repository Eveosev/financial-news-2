Mining investor Robert Friedland cut
his stake in  Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ) , the company he
founded to develop Mongolia’s biggest copper mine, to less than
10 percent.  Friedland’s holding in the company formerly known as
Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., fell below 10 percent after “private sale
transactions completed in late April,” Vancouver-based
Turquoise Hill said today in a statement.  The smaller stake means Friedland no longer has the right
to nominate directors to Turquoise Hill’s board, according to
the statement. As a result, Friedland nominees Livia Mahler and
Peter Meredith won’t stand for re-election at Turquoise Hill’s
annual meeting on May 10, the company said.  As of at least September, Friedland owned about 14 percent
of Turquoise Hill, now a 51 percent-controlled unit of London-
based Rio Tinto Group. His stake now stands at about 8.4
percent, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Turquoise Hill owns a controlling stake in the $6 billion
Oyu Tolgoi copper-and-gold mine in  Mongolia ’s Gobi Desert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
