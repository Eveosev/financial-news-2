CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures exchange, said it’s improving its technology to reduce
the time between when some customers see trade details and the
information is released to the public.  The Chicago-based company was responding to a story in the
Wall Street Journal today that said some high-frequency traders
can use time lags, or latency, to gauge the price direction of
futures markets to their advantage. The newspaper didn’t name
the traders that used this strategy or describe the profit they
earn from it.  “Out of the more than 300 million messages that come into
our platform each day, there may be times when customers can
experience a latency of a few milliseconds between the time they
receive their trade confirmations and when that information is
accessible on the public feed,” the company said in the
statement. “However, these instances are not consistent and
vary across asset classes.”  CME Group said it will be improving the computers and
software that form the backbone of its Globex electronic trading
system.  “Our goal is to bring variability as close to zero as
possible and we have made significant steps to address latencies
related to trade confirmations,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
