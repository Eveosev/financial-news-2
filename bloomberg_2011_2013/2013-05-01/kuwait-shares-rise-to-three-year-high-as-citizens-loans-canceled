Kuwait’s  benchmark index  climbed to a
three-year high on bets investors will boost stock purchases
after their retail loans are canceled.  Kuwait Food, the company known as Americana, advanced to
the highest since 2008 and Combined Group Contracting Co., a
construction company, increased the most since March 14. The
 Kuwait Stock Exchange Index (KWSEIDX)  rose for a ninth day, gaining 1.8
percent to 7,562.83, the highest since April 2010, at the close
in  Kuwait City . The measure surged 11 percent last month, the
sixth-best performer among 94 indexes tracked by Bloomberg.  The Persian Gulf country’s parliament last month passed a
law requiring the government to pay 744 million dinars ($2.6
billion) to purchase citizens’ loans taken before March 30, 2008
and write off all interest before rescheduling payments. The law
also requires banks to repay borrowers who were charged more
than 4 percentage points above the  base rate . Some 47,444
Kuwaitis who borrowed from conventional banks are eligible to
benefit from the law, according to estimates by lawmakers.  “Expectation that the cancellation of retail loans will
bring more inflows to the market has allowed the Kuwait Stock
Exchange to maintain its momentum for the past two weeks,”
 Julian Bruce , head of institutional trading at investment bank
EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai, said in an e-mail.  The  value of shares  traded in Kuwait climbed to 94.7
million dinars today compared with a three-month daily average
of 54.7 million dinars, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kuwait Food rose 3.1 percent to 1,980 fils, the highest
since October 2008. Combined Group Contracting gained 2.9
percent to 1,400 fils. United Projects Group KSCC, a provider of
air and catering services, jumped 5.3 percent to 800 fils, the
highest level in more than two weeks.  Elsewhere in the region, Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share
Index fell less than 0.1 percent at 1:31 p.m. in Riyadh. Dubai’s
 DFM General Index (DFMGI)  and  Abu Dhabi ’s measure were little changed,
while Qatar’s gauge lost 0.1 percent. Oman’s MSM30 Index
advanced 0.3 percent. Markets in  Egypt  and Bahrain were closed
for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
