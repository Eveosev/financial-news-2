Vitol SA, the world’s largest closely
held oil trader, was one of four companies that submitted
emissions-reducing projects to  California  regulators this past
month to qualify for early-offsets credits.  Vitol, a Geneva-based energy trader, proposed a plan to
destroy ozone-depleting substances from plants in Texas and
California, according to information  posted  on the air board’s
website. CE2 California II LLC, TerraPass Inc. and Camco
International Group Inc. also filed applications.  Vitol is the first oil-trading company to list a project on
the state’s website for potential early-action credits.  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  agreed in March to buy credits generated from a
project being developed by Forestland Group and Blue Source. The
air board is currently considering credits for 44 emissions-cutting efforts.  Mary Nichols, the board’s chairman, said at a conference
April 18 that the agency will issue the first carbon offsets
“soon,” while declining to specify a date. The credits can be
used by companies to cover up to 8 percent of their emissions
compliance.  Contracts based on California offset credits, each allowing
the release of one metric ton of carbon, slipped 13 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $11.63 a ton today, data compiled by
environmental broker Evolution Markets showed. Prices for
“Golden” offsets, which come with a seller guarantee to
replace any invalidated credits, were up 13 cents, or 1.1
percent, from a month ago, according to White Plains, New York-based Evolution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
