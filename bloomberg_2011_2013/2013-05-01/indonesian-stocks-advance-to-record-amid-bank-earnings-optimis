Indonesian  stocks  gained for a third
day to a record as optimism over earnings growth at some banks
overshadowed concerns about accelerating inflation.  PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) , the country’s third largest
lender by asset, provided the biggest boost to the Jakarta
Composite Index. PT Indofood CBP Sukses Makmur, which makes food
products, climbed the most in a week after reporting higher
first-quarter profit. PT Unilever  Indonesia  was the  biggest drag 
on the benchmark index after a 14 percent surge yesterday.  The Jakarta Composite closed 0.5 percent higher at 5,060.92
even as inflation concerns drove the yield premium investors
demand to hold Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds over two-
year notes to a four-week high. Data today showed the nation’s
 consumer price index  slowed in April to 5.57 percent year-on-
year from 5.9 percent the previous month. April’s reading was
lower than the median 5.67 percent forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of economists.  “Since the inflation number was good, some investors took
a position on banking stocks which offer good outlooks and lower
valuations relative to other lenders,” Andy Ferdinand, analyst
at Batavia Prosperindo Sekuritas said by phone today in Jakarta.  Bank Rakyat Indonesia, the nation’s second-largest lender
by assets, rose 2.7 percent to 9,650 rupiah. Bank Rakyat
generated first-quarter net income of 5 trillion rupiah ($514
million), more than PT Bank Mandiri’s 4.3 trillion-rupiah
profit. Mandiri rose 0.5 percent to 10,550 rupiah today.  Rising Valuations  While the Jakarta Composite rose for a fifth straight  month 
in April, the 1.9 percent gain was the smallest since December,
as valuations rose and speculation grew the government will
raise the price of subsidized fuel, boosting inflation.  The index, which has gained 17 percent this year, trades
for 15.4 times 12-month projected earnings, the highest level
since Nov. 10, 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
Indonesian gauge has doubled since the end of 2009 amid the
prospect of accelerating earnings growth in an economy that has
expanded faster than 6 percent annually the past three years.  Indofood CBP rose 3.5 percent, the most since April 25, to
a record 11,850 rupiah. First-quarter net income increased to
643.8 billion rupiah from 591.1 billion rupiah a year earlier,
the company said in a statement published in the Bisnis
Indonesia newspaper today.  Unilever Indonesia (UNVR) , a unit of the world’s second-largest
consumer-products company, lost 2.1 percent, its biggest drop
since April 1 to 25,700 rupiah. An offer yesterday by Unilever
Plc to raise its stake in  India ’s Hindustan Unilever Ltd. also
boosted shares of the Indonesian unit by 14 percent, sending the
stock’s 14-day relative strength index to 79.9. That’s above the
reading of 70 some investors use as a signal to sell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
