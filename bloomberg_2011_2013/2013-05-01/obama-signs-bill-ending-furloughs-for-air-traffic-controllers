President  Barack Obama  signed into law
legislation giving the Federal Aviation Administration authority
to shift funds to eliminate air-traffic controller furloughs,
the White House announced.  The furloughs were suspended April 27 following
congressional passage of the measure to let the FAA work around
across-the-board spending cuts that kicked in last month. The
law lets the FAA move as much as $253 million within its budget
to end furloughs, or unpaid days off.  It also gives the FAA enough flexibility to avert the
planned June 15 closing of 149 small-airport control towers
operated by agency contractors.  The House cleared the legislation 361-41 April 26 after the
Senate unanimously passed the bipartisan bill the previous
night.  To contact the reporters on this story:
