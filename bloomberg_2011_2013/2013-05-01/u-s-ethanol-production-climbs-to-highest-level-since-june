Ethanol  production  in the U.S. rose
0.5 percent to 857,000 barrels a day last week, the highest
level since June, the Energy Information Administration said.  Output jumped for a second consecutive week, the Energy
Departmentâ€™s statistical arm said in a report today. Stockpiles
plummeted 3.2 percent to 17 million barrels, the lowest level
since the week ended Nov. 4, 2011.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 96 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended April 26, up from 93
percent the previous week and the most since April 5.  The U.S. made no foreign purchases of the fuel after
 importing  39,000 barrels a day the previous week, the EIA said.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery declined 2.1 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.561 a gallon at 11:55 a.m.  New York  time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have gained 17 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
