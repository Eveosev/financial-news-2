Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , the seller of
 life insurance  and long-term care coverage, posted the second-
biggest gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after the unit
backing U.S. home loans reported its first profit since the
financial crisis.  Genworth gained 5.3 percent to $10.56 at 9:48 a.m. in New
York.  The Richmond, Virginia-based company has gained 41
percent this year.  Operating profit at the U.S. mortgage-insurance division
was $21 million, the first positive result since 2007, as the
housing market improves, the company said late yesterday in a
statement. Net income was $103 million in the first three months
of 2013, more than twice as much as the same period last year.  The U.S. mortgage-guaranty unit “provided the biggest
highlight,”  Mark Palmer , an analyst at BTIG LLC, wrote in a
research note. “Genworth’s performance going forward will be a
function of management’s ability to execute from an operational
‘blocking and tackling’ perspective.”  Mortgage insurers  MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG)  and Radian Group
Inc. have surged this year as the U.S. scales back its role in
the housing market and  home prices  rise. The firms cover losses
when homeowners default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  Humana Inc. had the biggest gain in the S&P 500 today,
rallying 7.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
