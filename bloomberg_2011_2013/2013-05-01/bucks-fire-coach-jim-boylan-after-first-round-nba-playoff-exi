The  Milwaukee Bucks  have fired coach
Jim Boylan, three days after the team’s season ended by losing
four straight games to the  Miami Heat  in the first round of the
National Basketball Association playoffs.  Boylan had a 22-28 record with Milwaukee after being
promoted from top assistant to replace Scott Skiles as coach on
Jan. 8. Bucks General Manager John Hammond said the decision not
to offer Boylan a new contract was made after a meeting today at
the team’s training center in St. Francis, Wisconsin.  “It’s in the best interest of the organization to seek a
new coach to lead our team,” Hammond said in a statement.  Boylan, 58, spent the past four seasons with the Bucks
after finishing the final 56 games of the 2007-08 season as
interim coach for the  Chicago Bulls .  Milwaukee went 38-44 this season and was the only one of
the NBA’s 16 playoff teams without a winning record. The Bucks
were one of two teams swept in the opening round, losing to the
defending-champion Heat by an average margin of 14.8 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
