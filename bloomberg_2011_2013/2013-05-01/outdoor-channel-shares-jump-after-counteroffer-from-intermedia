Outdoor Channel Holdings Inc. (OUTD) , the
owner of a cable-TV network with hunting and fishing programs,
jumped 7.5 percent after receiving a $9.15-a-share bid from
InterMedia Outdoors Holdings LLC.  The move continues a bidding war between InterMedia and
Kroenke Sports & Entertainment LLC for Outdoor Channel, which
climbed to $9.41 at 1:47 p.m. in New York. The  stock  had already
risen 15 percent this year through yesterday. The new bid values
the company at about $237 million.  Outdoor Channel had agreed to an $8.75-a-share price from
Kroenke in March, following an earlier deal with InterMedia that
offered investors a choice of $8 cash a share, a new share of
the new company or a combination of $4.46 in cash and 0.443 of a
share. The $9.15-a-share bid is an all-cash transaction,
InterMedia said in an open letter to Outdoor Channel’s board.  “We are confident that you, after consultation with your
outside legal counsel and financial advisers, will conclude that
our proposal constitutes a superior proposal,” InterMedia said.  InterMedia, based in New York, has said that it intends to
create a new publicly traded company combining its Sportsman
Channel and 15 magazines with Outdoor Channel. Kroenke, based in
Denver, owns and operates the  Denver Nuggets  of the  National
Basketball Association  and the  Colorado Avalanche  of the
 National Hockey League , in addition to the Pepsi Center, where
both teams play, and other sports teams and venues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
