Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL)  took
delivery of 7,837 raw sugar futures as part of transactions to
settle the expiration of the May contract on ICE Futures U.S.,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  The people declined to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media. The May contract expired
yesterday. An e-mail seeking comment from Iris Chan, the
company’s spokeswoman in  Singapore , wasn’t immediately answered.
It’s a public holiday in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
