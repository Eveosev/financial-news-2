Anadolu Group of  Turkey  is considering
investing in Georgian hydropower on top of the $600 million it’s
already said it will spend, the republic’s energy minister said.  The government signed a memorandum of understanding on
increased investment after the premier, Bidzina Ivanishvili, met
company officials in Davos in January, Kakha Kaladze told
reporters in Tbilisi today.  Tugban Izzet Aksoy, head of Anadolu Industry Holding’s
energy group, said in April that the company was “seriously
looking” into new investment opportunities in Georgian energy
production. The company plans to build a 150-megawatt hydropower
plant at a cost of about $300 million, he said.  Anadolu already planned to build new plants with a capacity
of 400 megawatts to 500 megawatts, Kaladze said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
