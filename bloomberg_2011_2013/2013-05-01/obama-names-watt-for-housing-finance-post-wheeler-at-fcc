President  Barack Obama  today named
U.S. Representative Mel Watt as his choice for director of the
Federal Housing Finance Agency and fundraiser Tom Wheeler to
head the Federal Communications Commission.  “Mel understands as well as anybody what caused the
housing crisis,” and will help the industry continue its
recovery, Obama said in announcing his choice at the White
House.  Watt, a North Carolina Democrat, would replace acting FHFA
director Edward J. DeMarco to lead the agency that oversees
Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac , the two mortgage-finance companies.
Both have been under U.S. conservatorship since they were seized
amid soaring losses during the 2008 credit crisis.  Wheeler, managing director at Core Capital Partners LP in
Washington, is a former leader of wireless- and cable-industry
groups. He would join the independent agency that regulates
broadcasters, cable-television companies and telephone-service
providers, replacing Chairman  Julius Genachowski .  Their nominations are subject to confirmation by the
Senate. Some Republican senators have already expressed
opposition to Watt, who was first elected to Congress in 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
