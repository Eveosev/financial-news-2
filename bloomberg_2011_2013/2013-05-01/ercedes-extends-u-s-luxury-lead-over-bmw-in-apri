Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz extended
its lead over  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW in U.S. luxury 
sales, as increases were reported for some pricier models, a sign 
wealthier consumers are more confident with the economic recovery.  Higher-end luxury models, such as BMW’s 7 Series, which
starts at $73,600, and the Audi A8, which starts at $72,200,
rose 69 percent and 30 percent respectively. The Mercedes SL-Class, which starts at $105,000, more than tripled to 938
deliveries in April.  “These are small numbers but still these are really
sizable gains for some of the most expensive vehicles in the
market today, excluding the exotics,” Alec Gutierrez, an auto
analyst for Kelley Blue Book in  Irvine ,  California , said in a
telephone interview.  Sales for the Mercedes brand rose 5.8 percent to 23,635 in
April, while BMW posted a 10 percent increase to 23,225. The
April results widened Mercedes’s 2013 lead to 4,695 vehicles as
the two German automakers compete for the sales crown BMW has
held for two years, based on reported sales. Counting
registrations, Mercedes topped BMW, according to researcher R.L.
Polk & Co.  Mercedes sales for the year through April gained 11 percent
to 92,822, Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler said yesterday in a
statement. BMW’s 2013 deliveries rose 6.7 percent to 88,127, the
Munich-based company said yesterday in a statement. The results
don’t include Daimler’s cargo vans and Smart cars and BMW’s Mini
brand, which aren’t luxury vehicles.  Confidence Climbs  Confidence among U.S. consumers climbed more than forecast
in April to a five-month high as Americans’ outlook for the
economy and their incomes improved, according to a gauge from
the Conference Board. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained
11 percent this year and closed at a record of 1,597.57 April
30. The index has gained for six straight months, the longest
such streak since September 2009.  “For the more wealthy, more affluent buyers, knowing the
values of their homes are a little more steady for the
foreseeable future, it gives them the confidence to jump out
into the marketplace and buy something new,” said Kelley Blue
Book’s Gutierrez.  U.S. sales of Wolfsburg, Germany-based  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi
brand rose 14 percent to 13,157, according to a statement. That
was the brand’s 28th straight month of record sales. The gains
included 27 percent for the A5 sedan and 32 percent for the Q5
SUV. Sales for the year rose 15 percent to 47,343.  Porsche, the Stuttgart-based automaker that is now part of
Volkswagen, said in a statement that it sold 4,032 vehicles in
the U.S. in April, a monthly record, for a 17 percent gain.  Lexus, Cadillac  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s  Lexus  reported a 3.1 percent increase
for April, to 18,091, as deliveries of the ES sedan surged 71
percent and the RX SUV rose 3.1 percent. Lexus, which was the
annual sales leader for 11 years until natural disasters in Asia
curtailed 2011 output, said it has sold 74,831 vehicles this
year, a 12 percent gain.  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac rose 34 percent to 13,230
vehicles in April, helped by the new ATS and XTS sedans, which
accounted for 42 percent of deliveries, according to a statement
from the Detroit-based company. GM sold 2,725 of the ATS and
2,891 of the new XTS.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s Acura brand boosted sales 14 percent to
13,899 last month, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement.  Nissan Motor (7201)  Co.’s Infiniti sold 7,844 vehicles, an
increase of 10 percent from a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based automaker said in a statement.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 7,615 Lincolns in April, a 21 gain from
a year earlier, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker reported.
Ford said sales of the MKZ sedan more than doubled to 4,102, the
first time the model has topped the 4,000 mark.  Land Rover sales rose 7.6 percent to 3,543, while Jaguar’s
gained 6.3 percent to 1,141, according to an e-mailed statement.
