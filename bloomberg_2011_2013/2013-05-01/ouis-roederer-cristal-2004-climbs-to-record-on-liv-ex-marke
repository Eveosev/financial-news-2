Louis Roederer Cristal 2004 Champagne
sold for a record 1,190 pounds ($1,850) a case on  London ’s
Liv-ex wine exchange today, up 4 percent from the end of last
year, Liv-ex data showed.  The vintage touched a low of 1,038 pounds a case on Liv-ex
in February 2011, and sold for close to that level as recently
as August, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  Cristal, whose 2004 vintage is a blend of 55 percent Pinot
Noir and 45 percent Chardonnay grapes from Roederer’s top
vineyards, spends an average of five years in cellars and rests
for eight months after disgorgement of the bottles, according to
Champagne Louis Roederer SA’s website.  The Louis Roederer Group’s interests extend beyond
Champagne to independently managed wineries such as Roederer
Estate and Scharffenberger in  California , Maison Delas in the
Rhone valley, Ramos Pinto in  Portugal ’s Douro and Bordeaux
vineyards including Chateau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de
Lalande.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:  Guy Collins in London at
