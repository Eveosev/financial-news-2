Oil production from  Alaska ’s North
Slope dropped 5.8 percent in April, a faster pace than its March
decline, as a problem at  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Central Gas Facility curtailed
crude output at Prudhoe Bay.  North Slope production dropped to 546,087 barrels a day
last month, down from 579,441 a year earlier, according to data
on the  website  of the Alaska Revenue Department’s tax division.
An injection compressor system at the gas facility shut down
April 22 for about 48 hours, Dawn Patience, a BP spokeswoman in
Anchorage, Alaska, said in a telephone interview today. The gas
is used to enhance oil recovery at Prudhoe Bay, Patience said.  Alaska’s North Slope has been yielding less oil every year
since 2002 as output from wells naturally declines and isn’t
replaced. March output decreased 4.9 percent from the year
before. The shrinking supply has boosted foreign crude imports
to the U.S. West Coast and prompted Flint Hills Resources LLC to
shut a crude unit at the North Pole refinery last year because
of rising oil prices.  “The greater Prudhoe area was impacted by this compressor
injector being down,” Patience said. The effect on average
daily production was “not really that significant on an annual
or monthly basis.”  Production at  Prudhoe Bay  dipped by 30 percent to 225,885
barrels on April 22, the day of the compressor shutdown, from
323,697 barrels the day before, according to the data. Output
didn’t recover above 300,000 barrels until April 26.  Valdez Inventories  Inventories of the feedstock at the Valdez marine terminal,
the northernmost ice-free port in  North America , averaged 4
million barrels last month, ranging from a high of 5.26 million
on April 29 to a low of 2.95 million on April 14, the tax
division data show.  Alaska North Slope crude  prices declined 4 percent in
April, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The fuel’s  premium  to
U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate was unchanged at $11.87 a
barrel today. It averaged $12.50 in April, compared with $16.17
in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
