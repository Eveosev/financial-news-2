Tim Hortons Inc. (THI) , the biggest donut
and coffee chain in  Canada , gained the most in 14 months on a
report that the company is being pressured by an activist hedge
fund to buy back stock.  Tim Hortons, based in Oakville, Ontario,  gained  4 percent
to C$56.76 at 12:16 p.m. in Toronto, the most  since  Feb. 23 last
year. It earlier rose 5.9 percent, the most since August 2011.  Highfields Capital Management LP, which which owns 1.6
percent of Tim Hortons, is pressuring the company to borrow $3.4
billion to buy back a third of its stock at $59 a share, Reuters
reported. It’s also calling for the company to spin off its
retail assets into a real estate investment trust, as Loblaw
Cos., a Canadian grocer, is planning this year.  Joseph Mazzella, general counsel at Boston-based
Highfields, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.
Alexandra Cygal, a spokeswoman for Tim Hortons, didn’t return a
message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
