Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , a U.S. biofuel producer
backed by French oil company  Total SA (FP)  and specialty-chemicals
maker  Lanxess AG (LXS) , fell to a four-month low after reporting that
its idled Minnesota plant will resume commercial production in
the second half of this year.  The company declined 10 percent to $1.66 at the close in
New York, the lowest since Dec. 31.  Gevo is reviewing the manufacturing process at its Luverne,
Minnesota, plant to eliminate sources of contamination that
forced the company to halt production of isobutanol in
September, Patrick Gruber, chief executive officer of the
Englewood, Colorado-based company, said in a conference call
yesterday.  He expects to resume some production “soon,” and to reach
commercial-scale operations by the end of the year.  “We’ll make decisions about how much and how fast to run
the plant once we see corn prices,  oil prices , isobutanol
prices, later this year,” Gruber said.  Investors “are somewhat concerned how much longer it will
take for Gevo to successfully ramp up production,” said Rob Stone, an analyst at Cowen & Co. in Boston, who today lowered
his 2013 revenue forecast for the company to $12.3 million from
$27 million. Isobutanol production in 2013 may be about 1
million gallons (3.8 million liters), compared with an earlier
forecast of 5 million gallons, he wrote in a note to investors.  Gevo uses corn to make isobutanol, a compound that may be
blended with gasoline or converted into hydrocarbon fuels and
chemicals. Its system also works with crop waste and other plant
matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
