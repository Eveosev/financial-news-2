U.K. stocks  rose, following a record
streak of monthly gains for the FTSE 100 Index, amid optimism
central banks will continue to stimulate the global economy.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  paced gains among
London-listed lenders, each rising at least 1 percent.  Kofax Plc (KFX) 
increased 1.6 percent after posting third-quarter earnings that
surged 77 percent.  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME)  tumbled 7 percent after
reporting a drop in full-year profit.  The FTSE 100 advanced 21.17 points, or 0.3 percent, to
6,451.29 at the close in  London . The benchmark has rallied for
the past 11 months, for the longest stretch of gains since its
beginning in 1984. The broader FTSE All-Share Index added 0.4
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 0.3 percent.  “It’s very important that the monetary stimulus stays in
place,” Adrian van Tiggelen, chief equity strategist at ING
Investment Management in The Hague, told Francine Lacqua on
Bloomberg Television. “We suppose that it will happen. Interest
rates are getting so low because of all the monetary stimulus
that equities, especially defensive equities, are becoming a
kind of safe-haven bond proxy.”  All western European markets except the U.K., Ireland and
Denmark are closed today for Labor Day. The number of shares
changing hands in companies on the  FTSE 100 (UKX)  was 42 percent lower
than the average of the past 30 days, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Central Banks  The Federal Open Market Committee releases its latest
interest-rate decision and policy statement at 2 p.m. in
 Washington  following a two-day meeting. Economists in a
Bloomberg News survey forecast that the central bank will not
change the pace of its monthly bond-purchase program.  The European Central Bank will cut its benchmark interest
rate to a record low of 0.5 percent tomorrow, according to a
majority of projections in another survey.  In the U.S., an ADP Research Institute report showed that
private payrolls increased by 119,000 in April, compared with a
gain of 158,000 in March. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had
projected an increase of 150,000.  Separate data showed the Institute for Supply Management’s
 factory index  dropped to 50.7 last month from the previous
month’s 51.3. That still beat economists’ average estimate of
50.5 in a Bloomberg survey. A reading of 50 is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction.  Standard Chartered rose 1.6 percent to 1,642 pence. A  gauge 
of London-listed lenders added 0.7 percent.  Barclays climbed 1.3 percent to 288.7 pence. The British

Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Fair in Hanover, Germany last month
generated a “large pipeline of leads which have been followed
up,” the company said in a statement.  Oxford Biomedica Plc (OXB)  jumped 21 percent to 2 pence, the
biggest rally in more than a year, after saying it signed an
agreement with Novartis AG to make clinical-grade material using
its LentiVector gene-delivery technology.  Home Retail Group plunged 7 percent to 144.9 pence after
the owner of the Argos catalog chain said so-called benchmark
pretax profit fell 10 percent to 91 million pounds ($141
million) in the year ended March 2.  “Our view of the 2013/14 financial year is that it will
remain similar to 2012/13, with consumer spending continuing to
be impacted by ongoing inflationary pressures and low levels of
 consumer confidence ,” the company said in a statement.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  dropped 3.5 percent to 334.3 pence, while
 Lonmin Plc (LMI)  fell 2 percent 263.6 pence. A gauge of mining
