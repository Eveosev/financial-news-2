Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE) , which
agreed to buy NYSE Euronext for $8.2 billion in December, said
first-quarter net income dropped 8.4 percent as trading in
energy and financial futures contracts fell.  Net income declined to $135.4 million, or $1.85 a share,
from $147.9 million, or $2.02 a share, a year earlier, the owner
of the second-largest U.S. futures market said in a statement.
Excluding costs related to its NYSE Euronext purchase and other
items, the company earned $2.03 per share, exceeding analyst
estimates of $1.97 per share, according to a  survey  conducted by
Bloomberg.  A 27 percent drop during the quarter in natural gas trading
at the company’s ICE Futures Europe market pushed total energy
trading down 4.3 percent, the Atlanta-based company said last
month. Energy transactions make up about 88 percent of the
company’s total volume, according to Rich Repetto, an analyst at
Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in  New York . Futures on equity
indexes at its ICE Futures U.S. market fell 19.6 percent,
driving its financial volume to decline 12 percent.  Revenue fell 3.6 percent to $351.9 million in the quarter
from $365.2 million.  Intercontinental will gain markets in interest-rate
derivatives from its purchase of NYSE Euronext, which is
expected to close in the second half of this year. The company
said today it will hold a shareholder vote on June 3 to seek
approval of the deal.  NYSE Euronext said yesterday that its first-quarter profit
rose 45 percent as revenue increased and it cut costs. Net
revenue from the New York-based company’s derivatives units rose
14 percent in the quarter while equity trading revenue,
excluding regulatory fees and liquidity payments, dropped 5.6
percent.  Intercontinental  rose  0.6 percent to $162.93 in New York
yesterday. The shares have  advanced  31.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
