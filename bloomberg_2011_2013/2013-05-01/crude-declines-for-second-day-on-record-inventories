West Texas Intermediate crude tumbled
as U.S. oil inventories reached an 82-year high amid signs of
economic slowdown in the U.S. and China.  Futures fell the most in two weeks after the Energy
Information Administration said stockpiles jumped to 395.3
million barrels in the week ended April 26, the most in weekly
data started in 1982. According to monthly data, they were last
at this level in 1931. U.S. companies added fewer workers than
forecast in April and China’s manufacturing grew at a weaker
pace, separate reports showed.  “WTI, in our view, is prone to some downward pressure,”
said  Michael Wittner , the head of oil-market research at Societe
Generale SA in New York. “The U.S. is very comfortably
supplied. The macroeconomic data flow continues to be weak.”  WTI for June delivery retreated $2.43, or 2.6 percent, to
settle at $91.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
falling the most since April 15. The volume of all futures
traded was 45 percent above the 100-day average for the time of
day at 2:33 p.m.  Brent for June settlement slid $2.42, or 2.4 percent, to
$99.95 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Volume was 39 percent above the 100-day average. Brent’s premium
to WTI widened 1 cent to $8.92.  “The crude market looks pretty grim,” said Bob Yawger,
director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
in New York. “The fact that we can hold above $90 with these
inventories is the only positive news for the market.”  Crude Inventories  U.S. oil inventories rose by 6.7 million barrels last week,
the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, reported.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected a gain of 1.1 million.  “It’s a huge build,” said Jacob Correll, a Louisville,
Kentucky-based analyst at Summit Energy Inc., which manages more
than $20 billion in companies’ annual energy spending. “All the
news seems to be bearish right now.”  Total  fuel consumption  dropped 1.4 percent to 18.3 million
barrels a day in the four weeks ended April 26, the lowest level
since January, the EIA report showed. Gasoline demand slipped
0.3 percent over the period to 8.51 million barrels a day, 1.8
percent lower than a year earlier.  ‘Overwhelming Supplies’  “The concern is that supplies are going to exceed
demand,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “The market is focused on the
overwhelming supplies.”  Crude inventories gained as  imports  jumped 8 percent to
8.17 million barrels a day, the most since Jan. 4. The refinery
utilization rate rose 0.9 percentage point to 84.4 percent. The
rate was above 86 percent in the three weeks ended April 12.  Combining “the relatively restrained refinery runs and the
big bounce in imports, you get this big build,” Wittner said.  Distillate supply, which includes diesel fuel and heating
oil, increased by 474,000 barrels last week. Gasoline stockpiles
slid 1.82 million barrels.  “With the huge build that we saw in crude, I do think we
will see lower prices, probably below $90 this week,” said
Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche
Capital Advisors. “ China ’s manufacturing is putting some
pressure on crude oil.”  Prices also fell as U.S. companies added 119,000 jobs last
month, the smallest amount since September, figures from
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute showed today.
The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
projected a 150,000 advance.  ‘Economy Moderating’  Manufacturing in the U.S. expanded in April at the slowest
pace in four months, the Institute for Supply Management’s
factory  index  showed.  “With the general economy moderating even more in the
U.S., inventory numbers like that will get people more nervous,
said Marshall Berol, co-portfolio manager of the  Encompass Fund (ENCPX) 
in San Francisco, which has about $250 million in assets.  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 50.6, the
National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said today. That compared with the 50.7  median
forecast  of analysts in a Bloomberg survey and a March reading
of 50.9.  The U.S. and China are the world’s two largest oil-
consuming countries, together accounting for 32 percent of
global oil consumption in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy. The U.S. used 21 percent.  ‘Worsening Outlook’  ‘‘The worsening economic outlook dovetailed very nicely
with the inventory build,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Concerns
about the economy are reasserting themselves.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 25.8 percent, compared with yesterday’s 22.8 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 639,094
contracts as of 2:35 p.m. It totaled 617,511 contracts
yesterday, 6.3 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.77 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
