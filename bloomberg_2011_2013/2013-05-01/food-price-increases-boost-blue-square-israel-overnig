Alon Blue Square Israel Ltd. (BSI) , the
supermarket retailer that led gains among Israeli U.S.-traded
stocks in April, is rallying on prospects higher food prices
will stoke revenue growth.  Shares of Blue Square advanced 0.5 percent to $3.76
yesterday in New York, extending a 27 percent surge in the month
to trade at the highest level in a year over the Bloomberg
Israel-US Equity Index. The gauge of the 25 largest New York-
traded Israeli companies fell 1 percent in April, as  Radware
Ltd. (RDWR)  posted the biggest monthly plunge since July on slowing
sales.  Israel ’s benchmark TA-25 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,204.14 in  Tel Aviv  today.  Blue Square, which owns the Mega, Shefa Shuk and Eden
Nature store  chains , joined other Israeli grocers in raising
prices by as much as 8 percent in the first quarter as protests
over rising living costs diminished, according to Israel
Brokerage & Investments Ltd. IBI, which recommends buying the
stock, projects a 30 percent rally in the next 12 months for the
Rosh Ha’Ayin-based company, whose supermarket sales accounted
for 64 percent of operational profit at the end of 2012.  “Since the protests dissipated, retailers have had some
scope to roll over the price increases onto consumers,” Zach Herzog, head of international sales at Psagot Investment House
Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “People are expecting the 2013 numbers will
stack up favorably.”  Shares of Blue Square in Tel Aviv have nearly doubled after
hitting an all-time low on Sept. 11. Its competitors  Shufersal
Ltd. (SAE)  and  Rami Levi Chain Stores Hashikma Marketing 2006 Ltd. (RMLI) 
have gained more than 41 percent during the period.  Lower Prices  Demonstrations began in June of 2011 in Israel as hundreds
of thousands of protesters called for more affordable housing
and lower prices for food and other consumer products. In
response to the protests, Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu 
appointed a committee led by economist  Manuel Trajtenberg , which
recommended a series of measures to boost competition.  “During the social protests in Israel, there was no
possibility to raise prices for the consumer,” Dorin Palas, Tel
Aviv-based analyst at IBI, said by telephone yesterday. In the
first quarter “prices went up, which will be an improvement for
sales in the retail sector.”  Fourth-quarter revenue at Blue Square rose 3 percent to 3.8
billion shekels, $1.07 billion dollars, the company said in a
statement on March 22.  Annual  inflation  slowed to 1.3 percent in March from 1.5
percent the previous month, the  Central Bureau of Statistics 
said April 15. That level is the lowest since June and below the
1.4 percent  median estimate  of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Shares Gain  Blue Square rose 0.5 percent to $3.76, the highest price in
a year. The shares gained 0.4 percent in Tel Aviv to 13.48
shekels, or $3.76. The Israel-US Index added 0.4 percent to
89.48.  Nova Measuring Instruments Ltd. (NVMI)  led the increase on the
Israel-US gauge, rising 4 percent, the most since Feb. 20, to
$9.17. Shares in Tel Aviv gained 3.1 percent to 33.02 shekels,
or $9.23 today. The company reported first quarter sales of
$27.4 million, a 24 percent jump from a year earlier, after the
close of the U.S. markets. The average estimate of two  analysts 
surveyed by Bloomberg was $26.1 million.  Caesarstone Sdot Yam Ltd. slipped the most on the index,
falling 1.9 percent to $23.46. The maker of quartz countertops
slumped 11 percent in April.  Compugen Ltd. (CGEN) , which uses computer programs to discover
proteins that may have the ability to treat diseases, rallied
4.4 percent to $5.99, the highest since March 12. The company
plans to announce a pharmaceutical partnership this year, which
will generate more revenue, Chief Executive Officer Anat Cohen- Dayag said in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in  New York 
yesterday. Shares jumped 3.9 percent in Tel Aviv today to 21.97
shekels, or $6.14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
