Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR) , the
largest owner of casinos in the U.S., reported a quarterly loss
that missed analysts’ estimates after revenue in its main
markets of Las Vegas and  Atlantic City  declined.  The first-quarter loss was $217.6 million, or $1.74 a
share, compared with a $280.6 million loss, or $2.24, a year
earlier, the Las Vegas-based company said in a statement today.
Sales fell 2.9 percent to $2.14 billion. Analysts on average had
estimated a loss of $1.59 a share on revenue of $2.19 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue in Las Vegas fell 2.6 percent to $751.7 million,
hurt by construction projects as visits to Caesars casinos
declined. In Atlantic City, revenue dropped 16 percent to $365.3
million, the company said, citing “continued competitive
pressure in the region, weakness in the economic environment,
and the slow recovery from  Hurricane Sandy .”  Caesars’ two largest markets have experienced differing
fortunes. Gambling revenue rose 31 percent to $696.1 million on
the  Las Vegas  Strip in February, the most recent month for which
data was available, according to the  Nevada Gaming Control
Board . In  New Jersey , where Caesars is the largest player with
four casinos, winnings for the industry fell 11 percent to
$238.5 million in March, according to the state’s  Division of
Gaming Enforcement .  Growth Investments  Shares in Caesars fell as much as 3.5 percent to $14.67 in
extended trading after dropping 4.5 percent to $15.20 at the
close in  New York . The shares have more than doubled this year
compared with a gain of 11 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Caesars said last month it’s creating a venture that will
raise as much as $1.2 billion to finance growth investments and
bolster the parent company’s balance sheet. Caesars Growth
Partners LLC intends to buy the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino
in Las Vegas as well as interests in the Horseshoe Baltimore
casino project currently under development and the company’s
interactive gaming unit.  The company, burdened by more than $20 billion in debt
after the 2008 leveraged buyout by Apollo and TPG, has
considered moves to strengthen its  capital structure  for the
past five years. Caesars, which went public in 2012, didn’t want
to sell more stock because it would dilute shareholders’
interests, and instead decided to sell growth-oriented holdings
to raise immediate cash while still retaining a stake in those
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
