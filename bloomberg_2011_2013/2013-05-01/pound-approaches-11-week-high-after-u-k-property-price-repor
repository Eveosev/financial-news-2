The pound was within 0.2 percent of an
11-week high against the dollar as an industry report showed
U.K.  house prices  were little changed in April.  The average cost of a home fell 0.1 percent from March to a
seasonally adjusted 165,586 pounds ($257,300),  Nationwide
Building Society  said. Prices rose 0.9 percent from a year
earlier, the biggest annual increase in 14 months. U.K.
government bonds were little changed before a separate report
that economists said will show that U.K.  manufacturing  improved
in April.  The pound traded at $1.5535 at 8:48 a.m. London time, after
climbing to $1.5569 yesterday, the most since Feb. 13. The U.K.
currency was at 84.78 pence per euro. It reached 83.98 pence on
April 26, the strongest since Jan. 24.  An  index  of manufacturing activity based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  rose to 48.5 last month from 48.3 in March,
London-based Markit Economics will say today, according to the
median estimate of 28 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  The pound has gained 1.2 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-nation currencies. Sterling is still down 3.2
percent this year.  The 10-year gilt yield was at 1.69 percent. The price of
the 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 was at 100.505. Two-
year rates were at 0.23 percent.  Gilts returned 1.7 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds rose 1
percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
