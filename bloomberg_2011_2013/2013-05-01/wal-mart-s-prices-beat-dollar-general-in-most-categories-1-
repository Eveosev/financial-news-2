Prices at  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  are
lower on average than  Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO)  and  Dollar
General Corp. (DG)  as the world’s largest retailer expands its
presence in neighborhood markets.  Wal-Mart prices were below Dollar General’s 100 percent of
the time in household goods and more than 85 percent of the time
in grocery, auto supplies, pharmacy and health and beauty aids,
according to a study conducted by Bloomberg Industries during
the past 22 months.  Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville,  Arkansas , is opening more
stores in residential areas, stepping up competition with dollar
stores which are more commonly located in neighborhood markets.
Grocery prices at Wal-Mart fell in the first quarter as part of
the retailer’s plan to spend $6 billion to cut prices in the
category.  Dollar stores “have a competitive advantage to Wal-Mart in
that their locations are in residential areas,” said Poonam Goyal, a Bloomberg Industries senior analyst based in Skillman,
New Jersey. “However, as Wal-Mart ramps up its neighbor market
stores, that advantage will no longer hold.”  Prices at Wal-Mart were lower than Matthews, North
Carolina-based Family Dollar 100 percent of the time in
household goods and 95 percent in health and beauty.  Wal-Mart  advanced  0.4 percent to $78.06 at the close in New
York. Dollar General, based in Goodlettsville,  Tennessee , was
little changed at $52.03. Family Dollar fell 1 percent to
$60.78.  To contact the reporter on this story:
