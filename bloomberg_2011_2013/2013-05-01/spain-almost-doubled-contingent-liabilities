The value of guarantees extended by
the Spanish government in the past year to help banks and power
companies and fund European rescue facilities almost doubled in
the past year.  Outstanding guarantees rose to 181.4 billion euros ($239
billion) at the end of February, according to an update of the
country’s Stability Program  sent  to the European Commission in
Brussels. That compared with 98.3 billion euros at the end of
2011, according to the previous version of the document released
a year  earlier .  Contingent liabilities are potential obligations subject to
a future event such as the default of the beneficiary of a
guarantee. Spain’s total contingent liabilities are equivalent
to about 21 percent of the country’s public debt.  The largest share of the liabilities was made up of 66.4
billion euros of guarantees on bond issues from credit
institutions, according to the report. Sareb, as the country’s
bad bank set up last year is known, had 50.8 billion euros of
guarantees, and another 31.9 billion euros were extended to the
European Financial Stability Facility, the fund used to rescue
countries including Greece, Ireland and  Portugal .  Guarantees extended to the program to securitize a power-
tariff deficit, a gap between the electricity price to clients
and the production cost, totaled 17 billion euros. The
government also had 10.9 billion euros in guarantees to the
banking bailout fund known as Frob and 3.6 billion euros to a
program to issue bonds backed by loans to small and medium-sized
businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
