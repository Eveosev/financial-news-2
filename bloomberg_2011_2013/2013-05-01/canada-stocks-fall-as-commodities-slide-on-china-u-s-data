Canadian  stocks  fell as commodity
prices slid after data showed China’s manufacturing grew at a
weaker pace in April and U.S. companies added fewer workers than
forecast.  Cott Corp. (BCB)  and Yamana Gold Inc. plunged at least 9 percent
after both reported disappointing earnings. Premier Gold Mines
Ltd. and New Gold Inc. slumped more than 3.3 percent as gold
extended its worst monthly loss in more than a year.  Loblaw Cos. (L) 
climbed 4.6 percent after posting better-than-forecast profit
and raising its dividend.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 78.12
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,378.38 at 9:54 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark equity gauge has lost 0.5 percent this year.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities fell 2
percent, as aluminum and oil declined almost 3 percent.  China’s manufacturing expanded at a weaker pace in April in
a sign that the slowdown in the world’s No. 2 economy is
extending into the second quarter.  China  is Canada’s second-
biggest trading partner.  The U.S. added 119,000 workers in April, the smallest since
September, following a revised 131,000 gain in March, figures
from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute
showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
