Authorities plan to charge three additional suspects for actions after the April 15  Boston Marathon bombings .  Two of the three people in custody are men originally from  Kazakhstan  who were friendly with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the main suspect, at the University of  Massachusetts  Dartmouth, according to a U.S. official who asked for anonymity because of the continuing investigation.  Robert Stahl, a defense lawyer for Dias Kadyrbayev, confirmed that his client was jailed. The other is Azamat Tazhayakov, the U.S. official said. The  Boston  Police Department said in a statement posted on its website that all three suspects were held.  Authorities plan to charge the three new suspects with obstruction of justice and making false statements, according to the official. The charges relate to actions after the bombings, the official said. Investigators suspect the men discarded items, he said.  Stahl said a hearing in Boston federal court is scheduled for 3:30 p.m.  Police in  New Bedford , Massachusetts, near the school, said April 22 that they believe Tsarnaev spent the two nights after the bombing with acquaintances near campus. Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev’s apartment was cordoned and searched that day.  The school is about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Boston.  Deadly Attack  Tsarnaev, 19, has already been charged with perpetrating attacks that killed three and wounded more than 260. His 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, died in a shootout with police. The younger suspect was wounded and is in a federal prison hospital outside Boston. It was the highest-profile act of terrorism in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.  Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev are already in custody for immigration violations. The third new suspect is a U.S. citizen, the official said.  Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, the widow of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, wasn’t among those arrested, CNN reported, citing an unidentified source at the U.S. Homeland Security Department.  The Tsarnaev brothers, ethnic Chechens who came to the U.S. with their parents as refugees from  Russia ’s Caucasus region, were motivated by radical Islam they learned mostly over the Internet, according to lawmakers briefed by federal law-enforcement officials. Questions still abound over whether they had help from people or organizations outside the U.S.  Genetic Material  The  Federal Bureau of Investigation  has been interviewing people connected to the brothers. Agents took DNA samples from Katherine Tsarnaev on April 29, according to a U.S. official who was briefed on the probe and asked not to be identified because the case is open.  Investigators have found female DNA on a bomb fragment, said the official, who cautioned that the genetic material may have come from a number of sources and that its discovery doesn’t necessarily mean that more people were involved in the crime.  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S. citizen, has been charged with two capital counts, including use of a weapon of mass destruction. He may get the death penalty if convicted.
