Guggenheim Partners LLC’s  Alan Schwartz , executive chairman of the $180 billion asset manager
whose executives own a stake in the Los Angeles Dodgers, said
the firm sees opportunities in building infrastructure through
partnerships between the private and public sectors.  “Infrastructure has been a neglected asset in many, many
parts of the world, including right here in the United States,”
Schwartz said today in an interview with Willow Bay on Bloomberg
Television at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly
Hills, California.  Guggenheim, based in New York and Chicago, is hiring
executives and expanding into businesses including merger
advisory, digital media and hedge funds. Chief Executive Officer
 Mark Walter  brought in Schwartz, the former CEO of Bear Stearns
Cos., in 2009 to help build operations such as full-service
 investment banking . The firm has added 250 to 300 investment
professionals in the past three years, Schwartz said today.  Glenn Schiffman, who was head of Asia-Pacific investment
banking at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., joined the firm last
week and Barclays Plc’s Andrew Taussig, who was head of
investment banking for retail companies, was hired last month.  Guggenheim hired former Yahoo! Inc. executive  Ross Levinsohn  this year to oversee a newly formed digital media
unit. The unit will look for assets that can benefit from
advertising around televised events, Schwartz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
