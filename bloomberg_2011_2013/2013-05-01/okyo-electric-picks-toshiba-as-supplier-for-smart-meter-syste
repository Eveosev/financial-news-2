Toshiba Corp. (6502) , one of  Japan â€™s three
largest power-equipment makers, was selected to supply Tokyo
Electric Power Co. with so-called smart meter systems that allow
users to access data on their power use.  Tokyo-based Toshiba will be a prime contractor and system
integrator of the communication system, the company said today
in a statement.  Tokyo Electric Power, or Tepco as the company is known,
plans to install smart meters in as many as 27 million
households in the next 10 years, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
