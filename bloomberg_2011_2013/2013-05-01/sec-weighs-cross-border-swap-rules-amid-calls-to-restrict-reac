JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  and other U.S. swap dealers would gain limits on the
Dodd-Frank Act’s reach for overseas trades under a Securities
and Exchange Commission proposal released today.  SEC commissioners voted 5-0 to seek comment on measures
that would exempt overseas affiliates, including those
guaranteed by U.S. banks, from registration when they conduct
business with foreign clients. Overseas branches of U.S. banks
would be exempt from Dodd-Frank standards for conduct with
clients for equity and some credit swaps.  “This approach would allow the elimination of overlapping
regulation when it truly is duplicative, while recognizing that
regulatory regimes will necessarily differ in some respects,”
SEC chairman Mary Jo White said at a meeting in  Washington .  The SEC said it hoped the proposal would influence how
global regulators address rule differences while working to
reduce risk and increase transparency in the swaps market. The
SEC is writing rules for equity and some credit-default swaps,
while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the
predominant U.S. regulator for the $639 trillion global market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
