Dean Foods Co. (DF) ’s  WhiteWave Foods Co. (WWAV) 
unit may become a takeover target for buyers such as  General
Mills Inc. (GIS)  after it is spun off from the dairy maker, said
Alexia Howard, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  WhiteWave shares will be offered this month, Dallas-based
Dean, which will retain a minority stake, said yesterday in a
statement. Dean also announced a reverse split of its shares and
the resignation of its chairman and three other directors. Dean
will be left with about a 20 percent equity holding in
WhiteWave, Howard said.  WhiteWave, which makes Silk soy milk and Horizon Organic
products, has been among Dean’s most profitable units by
operating margin as more health-conscious consumers migrate to
plant-based and organic milks. General Mills, whose yogurt
business is struggling against Greek varieties, may look to
acquire WhiteWave to take advantage of the trend, Howard said.  “This could pave the way for an acquisition of the
WhiteWave Foods company,” Howard, who’s based in  New York , said
today in a note. “It is also possible that other multinational
food and beverage companies could express interest in such a
dynamic business.”  Howard rates Dean outperform, the equivalent of a buy.  Dean rose 2.2 percent to $19.26 at 10:01 a.m. in New York.
WhiteWave jumped 5.7 percent to $17.75 and earlier climbed as
much as 6.3 percent for the largest intraday increase since Nov.
23.  Kirstie Foster, a spokeswoman for Minneapolis-based General
Mills, declined to comment.  Spinoff Details  Shareholders will receive about 47.7 million WhiteWave
Class A shares and 67.9 million Class B shares on May 23. For
each share of Dean common stock, holders will receive about
0.256 shares of WhiteWave Class A common stock and approximately
0.364 shares of WhiteWave Class B common stock, the company
said.  The action “puts the spinoff of WhiteWave in motion,”
Dean Chief Executive Officer Gregg Tanner said in the statement
yesterday. The separation “puts both companies on a path for
future success in their respective businesses.”  Dean said Gregg Engles resigned as chairman and a director,
effective immediately.  Tom Davis  was appointed to replace him.
 Stephen Green , Joseph Hardin Jr. and Doreen Wright also resigned
from the board. The company has withdrawn Engles’s nomination
for re-election at its annual meeting and cut the board’s size
from 12 to eight, according to the statement.  Dean will seek stockholder approval for the reverse stock
split. Shares will be issued at a ratio of at least 1-for-2 and
at most 1-for-8, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
