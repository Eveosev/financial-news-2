Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed after a report showed dwindling stockpiles of the
additive while prices for the motor fuel plunged on concern of
oversupply.  The price difference, or spread, contracted 9.67 cents to
26.03 cents a gallon based on June futures contracts. The Energy
Information Administration report showed that ethanol  stockpiles 
fell to the lowest level since November 2011, and that gasoline
inventories on the East Coast were the highest in more than a
year. Renewable Identification Numbers extended gains.  “The trade teed off with the stock draw,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .
“Obviously we’ve got pressure with the outside markets.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 1.4 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.459 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
May contract, which expires May 3, added 1.7 cents to $2.599.  Gasoline for June delivery tumbled 8.17 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $2.7193 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 96 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended April 26, up from 93
percent the previous week and the most since April 5, the report
from the Energy Department’s analytical arm showed.  Supply Decline  Stockpiles of the biofuel plummeted 3.2 percent to 17
million barrels, the biggest weekly decline since March 22 and
the lowest level since Nov. 4, 2011, EIA said.  Inventories have dropped as production recovered from a
drought last summer that boosted corn prices and caused ethanol
companies to reduce operations.  Corn for May delivery fell 1.5 cent to $6.8175 a bushel in
 Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable
fuel.  The corn crush spread was 12 cents a gallon, up from 10
cents yesterday. That compares with minus 35 cents on Dec. 31.
The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Ethanol  output  increased 0.5 percent last week to 857,000
barrels a day, the highest since June 29, EIA data show. That’s
still down 4.1 percent from a year earlier.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  rose 4.1 percent to 76.5 cents, the
highest since April 10, and a fifth day of gains, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcanes ethanol, increased 3.8 percent to 81 cents, the
costliest since April 22.  Government Mandates  RINs are certificates attached to each gallon of biofuel
and used by the government to track compliance with government
mandates for blending with petroleum. Refiners can maintain the
RIN or trade it.  The U.S. didn’t make any foreign purchases of the biofuel
last week after  importing  39,000 barrels a day the previous
week, EIA data show.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.58 a gallon as of
April 26, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. exporting 36,000 barrels of ethanol a day in
February,  EIA data show , down 27 percent from January and the
lowest since November.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.555 a gallon and on the West Coast at $2.775; in New
York the fuel rose 1.5 cents to $2.715; and in Chicago the
additive increased 1 cent to $2.575 a gallon, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf was unchanged
at 22 cents, while Chicago’s discount to  New York  Harbor
expanded 0.5 cent to 14 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
