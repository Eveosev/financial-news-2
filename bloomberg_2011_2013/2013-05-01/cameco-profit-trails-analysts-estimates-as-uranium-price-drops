Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the world’s third-
largest uranium producer, reported first-quarter profit and
revenue that trailed analysts’ estimates after a decline in the
price of the raw material in nuclear-reactor fuel.  Net income fell to C$9 million ($8.9 million), or 2 cents a
share, from C$129 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier,
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco said today in a statement.
Profit excluding one-time items was 7 cents a share, missing the
8-cent average of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
declined to C$444 million from C$466 million, less than the
C$473 million average of six estimates.  The price of  uranium  for immediate delivery has slumped 40
percent since the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami in
 Japan  led to a meltdown at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant. In response to the disaster, Japan
suspended its fleet of reactors while  Germany  canceled license
extensions, shut down some of its oldest nuclear plants and
ordered the others close by 2022.  “Fukushima is still a major factor in the uranium
market,” Rob Chang, a Toronto-based analyst at Cantor
Fitzgerald LP, said in a telephone interview before the results
were released. “On top of that, commodity prices around the
world have been dragged down by worries about global growth and
Chinese demand for raw materials.”  Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan’s state-owned producer, and Paris-
based  Areva SA (AREVA)  are the biggest uranium miners, according to the
 World Nuclear Association .  (Cameco scheduled a conference call to discuss results at 1
p.m.  New York  time at +1-877-240-9772 or +1-416-340-8530.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
