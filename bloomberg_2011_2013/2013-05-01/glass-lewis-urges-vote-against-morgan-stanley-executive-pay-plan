Morgan Stanley (MS)  shareholders should
vote against the bank’s executive pay plan in an advisory ballot
this month, shareholder-advisory firm  Glass Lewis  & Co. said.  Morgan Stanley gets an ‘F’ grade in tying executive
compensation to performance, as the New York-based bank paid
better than peers while performing worse, Glass Lewis said today
in a report. That compared with a ‘D’ for 2011.  Chief Executive Officer James Gorman’s pay was cut 7
percent to $9.75 million for 2012, and his compensation tied to
the year’s performance was 40 percent below target based on the
company’s performance, Morgan Stanley said in a March filing.
Total shareholder return, including appreciation and dividends,
was 28 percent in 2012, below the 36 percent median of the
bank’s nine largest peers, the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
