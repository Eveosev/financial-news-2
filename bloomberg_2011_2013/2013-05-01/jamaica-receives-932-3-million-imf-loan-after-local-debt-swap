Jamaica will receive a $932 million
loan from the  International Monetary Fund  after the Caribbean
island restructured about $9 billion in local debt for the
second time in three years.  Jamaica has started to “tighten fiscal policy and prepared
a comprehensive four-year economic reform program” to lower
debt, the IMF said today in an e-mailed statement. The agreement
calls for an initial disbursement of $207 million.  “The main objective of the program is to put public debt
on a firmly downward trajectory and thereby create a virtuous
cycle of debt sustainability and higher economic growth,” the
Washington-based lender said. “For most of the past three
decades, Jamaica has suffered from very low growth, high public
debt, and serious social challenges.”  Jamaica’s economy contracted 0.9 percent in the fourth
quarter of last year as the country struggled due to the effects
of  Hurricane Sandy . Central bank reserves fell below $1 billion
in February for the first time since 2001.  In a speech to lawmakers today, Finance Minister Peter Phillips said Jamaica may seek additional financing from the
 World Bank  and  Inter-American Development Bank , which has vowed
$1 billion in loans.  “We want to establish for ourselves a track record of
performance as the context for requesting further support as
needed,” Phillips said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
