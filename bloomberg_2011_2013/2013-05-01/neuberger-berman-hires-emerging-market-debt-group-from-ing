Neuberger Berman Group LLC, a New
York-based asset manager that oversees $216 billion, said it
hired 22 people to manage emerging-market debt, including 19
from ING Investment Management Co.  Neuberger’s emerging-market debt group will be led by Rob Drijkoningen, who will be based in The Hague, and Gorky Urquieta
in Atlanta. The group will manage currencies, corporate bonds
and Asian debt strategies, Neuberger said today in an e-mailed
statement. The former team at ING Investment Management oversaw
$16 billion in emerging-market debt assets.  “These experienced portfolio managers have a long and
successful history of delivering performance for clients,”
George Walker, chief executive officer of Neuberger Berman, said
in the statement.  Neuberger Berman, founded in 1939, has about $97 billion of
its assets in fixed-income. Neuberger Berman is majority-owned
by its employees and is in the process of buying out the
remaining stake in the firm held by Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
