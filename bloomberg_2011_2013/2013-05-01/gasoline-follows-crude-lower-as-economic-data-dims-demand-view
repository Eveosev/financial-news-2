Gasoline fell along with crude as
weaker manufacturing growth in  China  boosted concern that global
energy demand may slow. Crack spreads narrowed.  Futures sank as much as 2.6 percent. Chinese and Australian
reports today signaled a slowdown in manufacturing as a U.K.
Purchasing Managers’ Index showed a third month of contraction.
ADP Research Institute said U.S. companies added 119,000 workers
to payrolls in April, less than the median forecast of 150,000
jobs. The Energy Department will release weekly stockpiles data
at 10:30 a.m. East Coast time.  “The China PMI data was disappointing,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in New York. “It’s just a continuation what we’ve been seeing
in the last four to six weeks. Every macroeconomic data point is
suggesting a slowing global economy.”  Gasoline for June delivery slipped 7.12 cents, or 2.5

heating oil, may have increased 250,000 barrels last week,
according to the median of 11 analyst estimates in a survey
compiled by Bloomberg. Gasoline supplies probably decreased
900,000 barrels, the survey showed.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 1.4 cents
