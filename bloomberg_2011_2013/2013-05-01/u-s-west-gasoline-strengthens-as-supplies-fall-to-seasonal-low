Spot gasoline on the U.S. West Coast
surged against futures after the Energy Information
Administration said regional stockpiles of the motor fuel
dropped to a record low for this time of year.  Gasoline supplies in the West, known as the PADD 5 region,
fell for the 12th straight week to 25.9 million barrels in the
seven days ended April 26, the least since Aug. 10, and a
seasonal low in data going back to 1990, according to the EIA,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob,  in  Los Angeles 
strengthened 8 cents versus futures traded on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange to a premium of 15 cents a gallon at 4:25
p.m. East Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The same fuel in San Francisco advanced 6.5 cents to 16 cents a
gallon above futures. San Francisco’s  premium  to the Los Angeles
fuel shrank 1.5 cents to 1 cent a gallon, the narrowest level
since March 21.  Conventional gasoline  in  Portland ,  Oregon , surged 14 cents
versus Nymex futures to a premium of 34 cents a gallon, the
highest level since October.  Low-sulfur diesel  in Portland  strengthened 0.25 cent to a
premium of 3 cents a gallon against ultra-low-sulfur diesel
futures on the Nymex.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in  San Francisco  weakened
by 1 cent to 6.75 cents a gallon below ULSD futures. The same
fuel in Los Angeles strengthened by 0.12 cent to a discount of
3.63 cents a gallon versus futures.  Distillate fuel oil stockpiles on the West Coast climbed a
fourth week to 12.4 million barrels, the EIA said.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles rose for a second
day, gaining $2.10 to $15.98 a barrel at 4:27 p.m. New York
time. The spread, a rough indicator of refinery margins, is down
45 percent from this year’s high of $29.09 a barrel on Feb. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
