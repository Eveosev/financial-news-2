Marriott International Inc. (MAR)  can be
sued in the U.S. over claims it failed to provide adequate
security at an Islamabad hotel where a terrorist attack in 2008
killed 56 people, an appeals court ruled.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Richmond, Virginia, overturned
a lower-court ruling that Pakistan provided an adequate forum
for resolving a case brought by the family of Albert DiFederico,
a State Department contractor killed when a truck filled with
explosives exploded at the barrier gate to the Marriott
Islamabad Hotel.  “Because the DiFedericos’ central theory revolves around
Marriott’s coordination of security from its principal place of
business, there is inherent convenience to bringing this case in
its legal backyard,” U.S. Circuit Judge Roger Gregory wrote for
the three-member panel.  “The defendant is a corporate member and employer within
the community where this case would be tried,” Gregory said.
“A Maryland jury has a strong interest in deciding this case.”  Marriott, the largest publicly traded U.S. hotel chain, is
based in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The case is DiFederico v. Marriott International, 12-1635,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Fourth Circuit  (Richmond).  To contact the reporter on this story:
