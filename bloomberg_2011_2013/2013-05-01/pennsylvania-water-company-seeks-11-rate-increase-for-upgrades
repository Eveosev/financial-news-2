The Pennsylvania subsidiary of
 American Water Works Co. (AWK) , the largest publicly traded U.S. water
company, asked state regulators to approve an 11 percent rate
increase to replace aging pipes, pumps and infrastructure.  Pennsylvania American Water filed an application on April
30 with Pennsylvania’s Public Utility Commission requesting a
$6.12 a month increase in water rates for a typical customer. If
approved, the average monthly residential water bill, using
3,960 gallons per month, would be $58.63, or about a penny per
gallon of tap water, the company said.  The request is primarily to help pay for $731 million that
the utility has spent on improvements including replacing 300
miles of pipes and water infrastructure upgrades for 390
communities Pennsylvania American serves since its last rate
case in 2011, President Kathy Pape said in a statement.  The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the nation’s
water and wastewater infrastructure a barely passing D grade on
March 19, saying with almost 240,000 water main breaks a year,
it would cost at least $1 trillion to fix and replace systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
