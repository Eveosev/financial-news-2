The  Asian Development Bank  agreed to
invest $30 million in Indian clean-energy company NSL Renewable
Power Private Ltd. for wind and hydropower in the country.  The unit of Hyderabad-based NSL Group will use the funds to
partly fund construction of its 100 megawatt Tidong run-of-river
hydro project in Himachal Pradesh and 75-megawatt Chilarewadi
wind plant in Maharashtra, the bank said today in a statement.  The bankâ€™s first equity investment in a private Indian
renewable company will help NSL Renewable Power reach a goal of
installing 1,000 megawatts of clean projects by 2017 from 185
megawatts at the end of last year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
