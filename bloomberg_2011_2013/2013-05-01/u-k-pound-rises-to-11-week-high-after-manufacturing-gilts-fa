The pound climbed to an 11-week high
versus the dollar after a report showed  U.K. manufacturing 
shrank less than economists predicted last month, weakening the
case for more central-bank stimulus that debases the currency.  Sterling strengthened against 11 of its 16 major peers. A
gauge of factory output rose to 49.8 from a revised 48.6 in
March, Markit and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  said in London. Economists had forecast a reading of
48.5, according to the median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey. U.K.  house prices  were little changed in April,
 Nationwide Building Society  said today.  Government bonds  were
little changed, reversing an earlier decline.  “It was a better reading than anticipated and it continues
the theme of a slight improvement,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head
of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in
London. “Over the course of the last few sessions we have been
grinding higher in sterling. For now, it’s a more constructive
backdrop.”  The pound gained 0.3 percent to $1.5583 at 2 p.m. London
time, after climbing to $1.5596, the highest since Feb. 13. It
appreciated for a sixth day against the U.S. currency, the
longest run of gains since the period through April 27, 2012.
Sterling weakened 0.1 percent to 84.88 pence per euro. It
appreciated to 83.98 pence on April 26, the strongest level
since Jan. 24.  Britain’s currency has gained 1.3 percent in the past
month, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that
track 10 developed-nation currencies. The pound jumped above its
100-day moving average against the dollar for the first time
since Jan. 16. It’s still down 3.1 percent this year, the
indexes show.  Economy Recovers  Sterling has pared its decline this year as reports fueled
optimism that the economy is on a path to recovery. Gross
domestic product increased 0.3 percent in the first three months
of the year, exceeding economists’ forecasts, data from the
 Office for National Statistics  showed last week.  A  Bank of England  report yesterday showed U.K. lenders
granted more loans for homes in March than analysts predicted,
adding to signs the economy is improving.  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee next meets
on May 8-9. Governor  Mervyn King  has wanted to expand the
central bank’s 375 billion-pound asset purchase  program , or
quantitative easing, for three consecutive months but has been
outvoted by a majority on the nine-member policy committee,
minutes of their meetings show.  The 10-year gilt yielded 1.68 percent, after earlier
climbing to 1.71 percent. The price of the 1.75 percent bond due
in September 2022 was at 100.65.  Gilts returned 1.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds rose 1
percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
