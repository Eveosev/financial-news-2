Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , the casino
company controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , reported
first-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates as
growth in  Macau  gambling accelerated.  Net income rose 15 percent to $572 million, or 69 cents a
share, the Las Vegas-based company said today in a  statement .
Excluding items, profit of 71 cents beat the 67-cent average of
23 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue increased
20 percent to $3.3 billion, exceeding the $3.27 billion average
of estimates.  Gambling growth in Macau, where Las Vegas Sands owns four
casinos, has accelerated this year. Revenue for the operators
there rose 15 percent in the first quarter to 85.3 billion
patacas ($10.6 billion), according to Bloomberg Industries
research.  Las Vegas Sands said in a March regulatory filing that an
internal audit had revealed “likely violations of the books and
records and internal provisions” of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, a federal law that bars payments to foreign
officials for favors.  Last week Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP, Las Vegas Sands’
auditor since the company first sold stock to the public in
2004, resigned. The casino operator said there had been no
reportable disagreements with Pricewaterhouse going back to 2011
and that it is seeking a replacement.  Las Vegas Sands rose 1.6 percent to $57.15 in extended
trading. The stock finished unchanged at $56.25 at the close in
 New York  and has gained 22 percent this year.  (Las Vegas Sands plans a conference call at 4:30 p.m. New
York time at www.lasvegassands.com.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
