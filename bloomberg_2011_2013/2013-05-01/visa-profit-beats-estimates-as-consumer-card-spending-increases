(Corrects worldwide spending total in eighth paragraph.)  Visa Inc. (V) , the world’s biggest
payments network, posted a fiscal second-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates as consumer spending on credit and
debit cards climbed.  Net income  for the three months ended March 31 fell 1.7
percent to $1.27 billion, or $1.92 a share, from $1.29 billion,
or $1.91, a year earlier, when there were more shares
outstanding, the Foster City, California-based company said
today in a statement. That beat the $1.81 average estimate of 32
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income a year earlier was
helped by a one-time tax-related gain of $208 million.  Visa, led by Chief Executive Officer  Charlie Scharf ,
increased  dividends  and stepped up share repurchases as the firm
gained financial flexibility after joining rival  MasterCard Inc. (MA) 
in agreeing to a multibillion settlement with merchants over
card swipe fees. Visa also struck a deal in February with
JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. card lender, to let the
bank tailor payment solutions for merchants.  “To drive future transaction growth, we continue to invest
in new technologies, channels and capabilities to make Visa
transactions more valuable, accessible and secure,” Scharf, 48,
said in the statement.  The payment processor raised its forecast for adjusted
annual earnings per share growth to about 20 percent, from the
“high teens” projected in February.  Shares Advance  Visa climbed 2.1 percent to $169.50 at 4:42 p.m. in
extended trading in New York. The shares climbed 9.5 percent
this year through the close of regular trading,  outpacing  the
4.2 percent advance for the 70-company Standard & Poor’s 500
Information Technology Index.  MasterCard, the world’s second-largest payments network by
processed transactions, said earlier today that first-quarter
profit increased 12 percent to $766 million. Revenue at the
Purchase, New York-based firm climbed 8.4 percent to $1.91
billion, short of the $1.93 billion estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. The shares, which touched an all-time high
yesterday, fell 2.5 percent to $539.18, the most since July.  Visa’s total operating revenue climbed 15 percent to $2.96
billion, beating the $2.85 billion estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Worldwide spending on Visa payment cards climbed
8.8 percent to $1.03 trillion, adjusted for currency
fluctuations, according to the statement. Processed transactions
rose 6.2 percent to 13.9 billion. Cross-border volume, a measure
of spending by cardholders outside their home countries,
advanced 10 percent.  Spending on Visa debit cards in the U.S. rose 0.3 percent
to $285 billion, the first increase in a year, according to the
statement. U.S. credit-card purchases climbed 9.1 percent to
$244 billion.  U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the nation’s economy, cooled in March after higher payroll
taxes took effect in January. Scharf seeks to bolster Visa’s
growth outside the U.S. as the company has said it hopes to get
more than half of its revenue abroad by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
