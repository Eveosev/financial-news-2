West  Texas  Intermediate crude in
Midland, Texas, traded at a premium to the domestic benchmark
grade for the third time this year as a pipeline carrying oil
from the region increased flows.  WTI in Midland rose 15 cents a barrel to trade at a premium
of 10 cents over WTI in Cushing,  Oklahoma , at 2:04 p.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Magellan
Midstream Partners LP (MMP) ’s Longhorn pipeline began shipments last
month and  Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (SXL)  plans to start two
projects carrying crude from west Texas in the second quarter.  The light, sweet oil flowing to the Gulf Coast from west
Texas will compete with crude moving south from Cushing on the
Seaway pipeline.  The premiums for Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy Louisiana
Sweet over WTI both strengthened by 40 cents to $11 and $11.50 a
barrel, respectively.  Eugene Island crude and Bonito Sour both rose by 35 cents
to $9.10 over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium grew by 90 cents to $6.70 a barrel and
Mars Blend strengthened by 55 cents to $6.95 a barrel over WTI.
Southern Green Canyon strengthened 65 cents a barrel to a $6.10
premium.  The premium for Thunder Horse, which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, weakened
by 25 cents to $9.20 a barrel over WTI.  Bakken was unchanged at a discount of $2.25 a barrel
against WTI.  To contact the reporters on this story:
