Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , the insurer
rated one level above junk, said it needs to improve its credit
grade before returning capital to shareholders.  “We’d like to see the ratings higher than where they are
today, then that will be the time to look at various options to
improve shareholder value,” Chief Executive Officer Tom McInerney, 56, said in an interview today. “We’d like to have
the ratings agencies in a place where we have better ratings and
they have us at a stable outlook.”  Genworth avoided a  downgrade  to junk at Moody’s Investors
Service by isolating its U.S. mortgage insurer this year.
Standard & Poor’s still has a negative outlook on its BBB-
rating, citing a need to improve operating results at the
Richmond, Virginia-based company.  The insurer climbed 2.4 percent to $10.27 at 4 p.m. in New
York, the eighth-biggest gain in the S&P 500 Index, after saying
yesterday that first-quarter net income doubled. The mortgage
guaranty unit, which reimburses lenders when borrowers default,
had its first profitable period since 2007. McInerney is also
raising prices for long-term care coverage.  The firm has rallied 37 percent this year as an improving
housing market bolstered the unit. Still, Genworth’s shares have
tumbled about 60 percent since the end of 2007, as losses from
backing home loans drained capital during the housing crash.
Genworth suspended its dividend and share repurchases in 2008.  “A very high priority that I have is to improve returns
for shareholders and also return capital,” McInerney said.
