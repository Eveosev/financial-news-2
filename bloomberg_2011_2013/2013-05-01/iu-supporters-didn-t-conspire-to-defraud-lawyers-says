Lawyers for two supporters of  New York 
comptroller and mayoral candidate John Liu told jurors in
closing arguments their clients didn’t engage in a conspiracy to
funnel illegal contributions to his campaign.  Jia “Jenny” Hou, 26, Liu’s former campaign treasurer, and
Xing Wu “Oliver” Pan, 47, a fundraiser, are charged in a
scheme to use straw donors to obtain thousands of dollars in
matching funds from the city for the campaign.  Pan’s lawyer, Irwin Rochman, told the federal court jury in
 Manhattan  today that his client had been ensnared in the case
after the government was thwarted in an attempt to implicate Liu
in wrongdoing.  “Mr. Pan is collateral damage in the government’s
obsessive pursuit to make a criminal case against  John Liu ,”
Rochman said in closing arguments. “I don’t represent John Liu,
I don’t give a damn about John Liu, but that’s how we got here,
they’re now struggling to make this a federal case. This case
doesn’t belong in this courthouse, it doesn’t belong here, and
Mr. Pan is not guilty of federal crimes.”  The case is U.S. v. Pan, 1:12-cr-00153, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
