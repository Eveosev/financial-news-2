Magna International Inc. (MG) ,  North
America ’s largest auto-parts maker, said an explosion at a
Newmarket, Ontario, factory sent five employees to hospital.  The injuries are not life-threatening, Tracy Fuerst, a
spokeswoman for the Aurora, Ontario-based firm said today by
telephone.  “The investigators are on site,” Fuerst said.“When
they’re done with their investigations we’ll be in
communication.’  The explosion occurred at about 9:45 a.m. at Dortec
Industries, a division which makes door modules, locks and other
components for Magna, Fuerst said.  About 200 employees work at the factory, which was
evacuated, she said. The company has no details on when it will
re-open, Fuerst said.  Magna shares fell 0.8 percent to C$60.11 at 1.24 p.m. in
