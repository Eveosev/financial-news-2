Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES) , Australia’s second-
largest retailer, will sell a 75 percent stake in 19 shopping
centers owned by its Coles unit to property fund manager ISPT
Pty Ltd. for about A$400 million ($414 million).  The two companies formed a venture to hold the shopping
centers, which are valued at about A$532 million, Wesfarmers
said in a regulatory statement today. The Perth, Australia-based
company will retain a 25 percent stake in the centers and
continue to manage them.  “ISPT and Coles will also look to place further properties
into the joint venture as opportunities arise,” Wesfarmers
said.  Wesfarmers, which also owns mines, chemical companies, and
an investment bank, has spent five years turning around the
Coles group of supermarkets and department stores it bought for
about A$19.7 billion in 2007. Larger rival Woolworth’s Ltd. in
October said it planned to spin off 69 stores and shopping malls
valued at A$1.41 billion into a real estate investment trust and
offer existing investors shares in the new REIT.  Wesfarmers,  Australia ’s largest employer, owns Target and
Kmart discount department stores and Bunnings hardware outlets.
ISPT is an Australian unlisted property fund with A$8 billion of
funds under management, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
