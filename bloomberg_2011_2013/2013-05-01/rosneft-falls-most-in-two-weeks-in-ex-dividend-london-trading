OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest crude
producer, fell the most in two week in London as the stock
traded without the right to its latest dividend.  While Chief Financial Officer Svyatoslav Slavinsky said
last week that Rosneft is committed to a 25 percent payout to
shareholders, the company hasn’t officially announced a dividend
amount via JPMorgan Chase & Co., its depositary bank. The  oil
company  will probably pay about 26 cents per global depositary
receipt, according to  Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts. (ROSN)   The GDRs slipped 20.5 cents, or 3 percent, to $6.63 at the
close in London, the biggest drop since April 17. Adjusting for
the estimated 26-cent payout, the GDRs would be 5.5 cents
higher. Trading volume was 1.5 times the three-month daily
average, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Brent crude  fell 2.6
percent to $99.70 a barrel, declining for a second day.  “Despite the fact it’s gone ex-dividend today and Brent is
slumping back down onto the psychological support level of $100,
Rosneft is actually managing to eke out a minor increment on
decent, above-average volume,” Julian Rimmer, an equities
trader at CF Global Trading in London, said by e-mail today.  Markets in Russia were closed for a public holiday today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
