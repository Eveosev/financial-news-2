Japanese monthly vehicle sales rose
for the first time in eight months in April, which included one
more business day than last year, and as consumer sentiment
benefited from a rally in Japanese stock prices.  Sales increased 1.5 percent to 365,165 units last month,
which had 21 business days, compared with 20 days in April 2012,
according to the  Japan Automobile Dealers Association  and the
 Japan Mini Vehicles Association .  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  deliveries
rose 5.4 percent.  Vehicle sales had slumped in Japan since September, when
government subsidies for fuel-efficient cars expired. The
increase in April deliveries is prompting speculation that a 33
percent  surge  in Japan’s benchmark  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average is
boosting  consumer confidence , said Satoru Takada, a Tokyo-based
auto analyst at Toward the Infinite World Inc.  “This slight gain may be seen as an improvement in
consumer outlook,” Takada said by phone today. “With the stock
market performing very strongly, there may be a mood to replace
older cars with new ones.”  Vehicle sales in Japan will probably shrink 12 percent this
year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association estimates.  Nissan Motor Co.’s April sales fell 4.8 percent in  Japan  to
37,541 units, while Honda Motor Co.’s slumped 12.6 percent to
48,500 units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
