Rubber declined as  Japan ’s currency
strengthened and data signaled a slowdown in business activity
in  China  and the U.S., the world’s biggest users.  The contract for October delivery lost 1.1 percent to
settle at 259.6 yen a kilogram ($2,664 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange. Futures fell for a third month in
April and have dropped 14 percent this year.  The yen climbed to 97.05 per dollar, nearing a two-week
high, after data showed U.S. business activity shrank for the
first time in more than three years. China’s  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index was at 50.6, the National Bureau of Statistics
and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today in
Beijing. That compared with the 50.7 median forecast of 31
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and a March reading of 50.9.  “Weak economic data recently has led to the yen’s rebound
and cut investor appetite for yen-based futures,”  Kazuhiko
Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said today.  Crude rubber stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses rose 2
percent to 15,976 tons on April 20, according to the Rubber
Trade Association of Japan.  Thai rubber free-on-board gained for a seventh session
yesterday, rising 1.5 percent to 85.80 baht ($2.93) a kilogram,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand. Markets
in China and Thailand are closed today for public holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
