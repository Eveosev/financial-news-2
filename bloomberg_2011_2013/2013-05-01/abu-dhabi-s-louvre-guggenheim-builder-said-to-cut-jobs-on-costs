the state-owned developer building branches of the Louvre and
Guggenheim museums in Abu Dhabi, fired employees from several
departments to reduce costs, two people with knowledge of the
matter said.  Job cuts were made in departments including project
management and marketing, said the people, who asked not to be
identified citing company policy. The people said they didn’t
know the number of employees dismissed.  “TDIC constantly evaluates its manpower requirements to
ensure that its projects continue to be delivered on schedule
and to the highest quality,” the company said in an e-mailed
response to questions. TDIC had 500 employees at the end of
2011, according to its most recently published annual report.  TDIC is building local branches of the Paris and  New York 
museums on Saadiyat Island, which is being developed as part of
the United Arab Emirates’ push to diversify its economy away
from oil revenue. The $27 billion worth of projects on the
island include the Zayed National Museum and a New York
University campus. TDIC company is also building homes and
offices there.  Property values in Abu Dhabi fell by half as speculative
