JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
and other U.S. swap dealers would win some exemptions from Dodd-
Frank Act regulations for their overseas swap trades under rules
being considered by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  SEC commissioners are scheduled to vote at a meeting in
 Washington  today on rules that would exempt U.S. swap dealers’
foreign branches from business conduct standards with their
clients. The SEC proposal seeks a more limited reach than the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s guidance released last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
