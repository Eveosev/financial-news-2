CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) , the largest
provider of prescription drugs in the U.S., reported first-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates, helped by demand
for flu medications and new generic drugs.  Net income increased 23 percent to $956 million, or 77
cents a share, from $776 million, or 59 cents, a year earlier,
the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding some items, profit totaled 83 cents a
share. Analysts projected 79 cents, the average of 19  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo cited the flu season
and the introduction of new generic drugs as key drivers of
profitability during the quarter. The flu hit the U.S. earlier
than normal this year, with 47 states reporting widespread
instances of the virus in early January, according to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Retail pharmacy
same-store prescription volumes rose 2 percent in the quarter.  “The strong incidence of flu in January/February helped
boost prescription volume,” Tom Gallucci, an analyst at Lazard
Capital Markets in New York, wrote in a note April 25. He
recommends buying CVS shares.  CVS  advanced  1 percent to $58.75 at the close in New York.
The shares have climbed 22 percent this year, outpacing a gain
of 11 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The company raised the lower end of its full-year earnings
forecast, projecting adjusted per-share profit of $3.89 to $4.
It had estimated a minimum of $3.86 in February. Analysts
 expected  $3.96, on average.  First-quarter gross margin, the percentage of sales left
after cost of goods sold, widened to 18.1 percent from 16.6
percent a year earlier, helped by rising demand for more-
profitable generic drugs.  Revenue was little changed at $30.8 billion, topping the
$30.2 billion average of analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
