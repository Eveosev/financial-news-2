Crude oil options volatility climbed
for a third day as underlying futures slumped after a government
report showed nationwide supplies dropped to the lowest level in
82 years.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 25.56 percent at 3:30 p.m. on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange, up from 22.8 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate for June delivery retreated $2.43,
or 2.6 percent, to settle at $91.03 a barrel on the Nymex,
falling the most since April 15. The volume of all futures
traded was 45 percent above the 100-day average at 2:33 p.m.  Oil stockpiles jumped to  395.3 million barrels  in the seven
days to April 26, the most since the government began gathering
weekly data in 1982, according to U.S. Energy Information
Administration data. According to monthly data, they were last
at this level in 1931.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $90 puts, which rose 81 cents to $1.50 a barrel at 3:35
p.m. on 5,432 lots. The second-most active were June $80 puts,
which gained 5 cents to 10 cents a barrel on volume of 4,255
contracts.  Puts, or bets that crude futures will fall, accounted for
65 percent of electronic trading volume and were the five most-
traded contracts.  Put Skew  The so-called put skew, measuring the volatility of June
puts and calls protecting against a 10 percent drop or rise in
futures, increased to 11.3 percentage points from 9.6 yesterday.  Bullish bets, or bets that prices would rise, made up 51
percent of the volume of 150,271 contracts yesterday.  June $90 puts were the most-active options in the previous
session, with 6,987 lots changing hands as they gained 23 cents
to 69 cents a barrel. August $102.50 calls dropped 17 cents to
82 cents a barrel on volume of 5,060 contracts.  Open interest was highest for June $80 puts with 40,487

$110 calls with 34,144.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
