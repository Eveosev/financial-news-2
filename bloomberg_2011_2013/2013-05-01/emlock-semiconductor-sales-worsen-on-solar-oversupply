Sales at Hemlock Semiconductor Corp.,
the largest U.S. maker of material polysilicon used to make
solar panels, continued to worsen in an oversupplied market, its
largest joint-venture parent Dow Corning Corp. said today.  Hemlock is “challenged” and faces “the threat of
potential duties on its products sold into  China ,” Midland,
Michigan-based Dow Corning said in a statement today. It
contributed to a 17 percent sales drop at Dow Corning in the
first quarter to $1.26 billion.  Hemlock’s performance worsened as “the solar polysilicon
industry deals with excess inventories and awaits resolution of
the global trade disputes,” Dow Corning Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer J. Donald Sheets said in
the statement. China, which makes most of the world’s panels,
may soon impose a tax on polysilicon imports.  Dow Corning, which is owned by Dow Chemical Co. and  Corning
Inc. (GLW) ,  holds  63.25 percent of Hemlock, Michigan-based Hemlock,
while Shin-Etsu Handotai Co. holds 24.5 percent and Mitsubishi
Materials Corp. holds 12.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
