Bonds of a unit of Energy Future
Holdings Corp. jumped by the most in more than two months on the
same day the electricity provider was required to begin making
cash coupon payments on another one of its securities.  Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Co.’s $1.83 billion of
10.25 percent notes due November 2015 rose 2.25 cents to 13.5
cents on the dollar at 9:35 a.m. in  New York , according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. That’s the biggest increase since Feb. 11.  Energy Future is required to make a cash interest payment
today on Texas Competitive’s $1.75 billion of 10.5 percent, 2016
notes, on which it previously elected to make so-called payment-
in-kind disbursements, adding the coupon to the principal rather
than paying cash to bondholders.  Energy Future Chief Financial Officer Paul Keglevic said in
a Feb. 19 earnings call that the company planned to make the
upcoming May coupon payment.  Allan Koenig , a spokesman, said
today that hadn’t changed. “It’s incorporated in our plans to
make it,” he said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
