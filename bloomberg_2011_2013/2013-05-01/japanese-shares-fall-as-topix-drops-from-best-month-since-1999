Japanese  shares  fell, with the  Topix (TPX) 
Index dropping after posting its biggest monthly advance since
1999, as earnings reports from Alps Electric Co. to  Tokyo 
Electron Ltd. disappointed investors.  Alps Electric, a car audio maker, slumped 8.9 percent and
semiconductor manufacturer Tokyo Electron dropped 4.1 percent
after forecasting profit that missed analyst estimates. Tokyo
Electric Power Co., operator of the stricken Fukushima nuclear
power plant, slid 3 percent after reporting a loss six times
bigger than its forecast. Tokuyama Corp., a chemicals maker,
advanced the most on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average after
forecasting a return to profit.  The Topix lost 0.6 percent to 1,158.37 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, with about nine stocks falling for every seven
that rose on the 1,711-member gauge. The measure yesterday
capped a 13 percent advance for the month, its best gain since
March 1999. The Nikkei 225 slid 0.4 percent to 13,799.35 today.  “With Japanese shares rising this far, there’s going to be
some profit taking going on,” said Takashi Aoki, a Tokyo-based
 fund manager  at Mizuho Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $34 billion. “With earnings, it’s becoming clearer that
there are some companies that cannot be saved just by the weaker
yen.”  The Topix advanced 6 percent from mid-November as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation. Brokerages, real-estate
companies and makers of rubber products have led gains among the
33  industries  on the gauge.  Relative Value  The Topix traded at 1.3 times  book value , compared with 2.4
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.6 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Of the companies that have reported annual earnings since
March 31 and for which Bloomberg has estimates, 150 companies
have beaten analyst projections and 114 have fallen short,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Alps Electric slumped 8.9 percent to 675 yen, the biggest
drop on the  Nikkei 225  and its biggest decline since October.
The company forecast net income this year of 9.5 billion yen,
missing the 10.8 billion yen  estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Tokyo Electron, the third-biggest drag on the Nikkei 225,
slid 4.1 percent to 4,785 yen after forecasting 13 billion yen
in profit this year, below the 16.3 billion yen estimates of
analysts before its earnings were announced.  U.S. Futures  Among other stocks that fell, Tokyo Electric Power declined
3 percent to 417 yen, after posting a net loss of 685.3 billion
yen for the year ended March. The figure is more than six times
worse than the company’s forecast, while also missing the 133
billion yen in analysts’ estimates.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The U.S.
equity  benchmark index  closed at another record yesterday as
 consumer confidence  gained and investors bet central banks
worldwide will continue their efforts to stimulate the economy.  Among stocks that rose, Tokuyama jumped 8.8 percent to 285
yen as it forecast 7.5 billion yen in net income after posting a
38 billion yen net loss last fiscal year.  Nippon Paper Industries Co. posted the second-biggest gain
on the Nikkei 225 and led the  pulp and paper  sector higher on
the Topix Index after Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities
Co. boosted its rating on the stock to outperform. The shares
jumped 8.3 percent to 1,573 yen.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index fell 7.4 percent
to 23.39 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.8
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Volume on
the gauge was 29 percent below its 30-day average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Markets will be closed in  Japan  on May 3 and 6 for public
holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
