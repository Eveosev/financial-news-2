Britain’s Royal Air Force has
conducted its first Reaper drone strike in  Afghanistan  using
operators based in the U.K.  “A Reaper remotely piloted aircraft system, operated by
pilots from 13 Squadron located at RAF Waddington, has fired a
weapon during a mission supporting U.K. forces on the ground in
Afghanistan,” the Ministry of Defense said in an e-mailed
response to questions, without disclosing further details.  Protesters opposed to British involvement in unmanned
aerial attacks staged a protest at the Waddington base in
eastern  England  over the weekend.  RAF personnel have previously controlled British and U.S.
Air Force Reaper and Predator drones from a base in  Nevada 
during missions in Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq. U.K. forces
conducted around 2,150 missions between October 2006 and Dec.
31, 2012, armed forces minister Andrew Robathan said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
