Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said
“confusion” on the part of the South African government was at
the heart of a dispute over U.K. plans to end 19 million pounds
($30 million) a year of aid to  Africa ’s largest economy in 2015.  The South African Department of International Relations and
Cooperation said in a  statement on its website  yesterday that
the move is “tantamount to redefining our relationship” and
the U.K. should have “allowed proper consultations to take
place.” British International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced the  end to direct aid  the same day.  Hague said today that the U.K. would address any
“bureaucratic confusion” over the decision, though it should
not have been a surprise to the South African government.  “Britain has helped to improve matters in  South Africa ,
but we don’t continue to give aid to countries that are raising
their incomes, that have growing economies,” Hague told the
 BBC ’s “Today” radio program. “No doubt there is some
confusion or bureaucratic confusion about that perhaps, on the
South African side, but I’m not going to fling accusations about
that.”  He said that the two governments will meet in the near
future and any confusion will be cleared up then.  To contact the reporters on this story:
