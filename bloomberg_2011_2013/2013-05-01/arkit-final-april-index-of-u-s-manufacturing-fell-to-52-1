The Markit Economics  final index  of
U.S. manufacturing decreased to 52.1 in April from 54.6 a month
earlier, the London-based group said today.  An index above 50 for the  purchasing managers ’ measure
indicates expansion. The preliminary reading was 52.  Markit’s purchasers figure is based on responses from about
85 percent to 90 percent of companies in a poll of more than 600
American manufacturers.  Manufacturing across the globe is struggling to improve. In
China, the world’s second-largest economy, factories expanded at
a weaker pace in April. The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to
50.6 last month from 50.9 in March.  A U.K. factory index showed manufacturing contracted for a
third month. The gauge rose to 49.8 last month from 48.6,
according to Markit and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply .  To contact the reporter on this story:
