(Corrects amount of shares that were offered in second
paragraph.)  ING U.S. Inc. (VOYA) , the New York-based unit
of the largest Dutch financial-services company, raised $1.27
billion in its initial public offering, pricing an increased
number of shares below the marketed range.  ING U.S. sold 65.2 million shares for $19.50 each,
according to a statement yesterday, after offering 64.2 million
shares for $21 to $24 apiece. ING U.S. will be renamed Voya
Financial after the IPO and the switch will take about two
years, the company has said. The stock will start trading today,
listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VOYA.  ING Groep NV (INGA)  took its U.S. unit public after it agreed to
sell global-insurance and investment-management operations to
win European Union approval of its 2008 bailout from the
Netherlands. Jan Hommen, chief executive officer of the
Amsterdam-based parent, has overseen more than 25  asset
disposals  for at least 20 billion euros ($26 billion) in
proceeds. Rodney Martin, the CEO of ING U.S., helped American
International Group Inc. repay its rescue by divesting assets.  “While the price is slightly disappointing, the miss in
proceeds for ING isn’t very significant in the whole process,”
said Tom Muller, an Amsterdam-based analyst at Theodoor Gilissen
Bankiers NV who doesn’t recommend clients buy the stock. “The
company is good and healthy yet it has a long way to go in its
recovery.”  Debt Payment  ING Groep  shares  fell 0.6 percent to 6.19 euros as of 9:18
a.m. in Amsterdam trading today, giving the company a market
value of 23.7 billion euros. That compares with a 0.1 percent
gain in the 33-company Stoxx Insurance 600 Index.  ING U.S., which has about 13 million customers and sells
life insurance, annuities and retirement products, said in
filings before the IPO that it would receive $600 million of
gross proceeds from the offering, which it would combine with
about $1.4 billion of payments from subsidiaries and $1.1
billion from a planned debt sale to help repay borrowings.  ING U.S.’s IPO is the second largest in the U.S. this year,
behind the $2.6 billion initial offering by Pfizer Inc.’s
animal-health unit  Zoetis Inc. (ZTS)  in January, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
led the sale.  Scaling Back  ING U.S. scaled back from selling equity-linked retirement
products known as variable annuities. It was the fourth-largest
seller of the contracts in 2007 and had dropped out of the top
20 by 2011, according to data from industry group Limra.  The insurer is focusing on managing assets for retail
clients and institutional investors and selling protection
products such as life insurance. The retirement segment provided
49 percent of operating earnings before taxes in 2012, and
individual life accounted for 21 percent, the IPO filing shows.  The net loss in the three months ended March 31 was about
$190 million to $230 million, ING U.S. said in a filing last
week. The loss was driven by hedges that guard against falling
stocks on variable annuities. Operating earnings before taxes in
the ongoing business were about $270 million to $290 million,
ING U.S. said.  ING Groep, which has pledged to repay all 10 billion euros
in state support by 2015, so far has returned 7.8 billion euros,
as well as 2.4 billion euros in interest and premiums.  Proceeds
of the share sale, seen at about $700 million, will be used to
pay off debt at ING group level, the Dutch company said.  After the IPO, it will own 75 percent of its U.S. unit. ING
has to dispose of the entire division by the end of 2016.  To contact the reporters on this story:
