The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in Australia and  Japan  against non-payment decreased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 0.5 of a basis point to
82.5 basis points as of 8:25 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The benchmark has tumbled 76.5 basis
points this year and is trading at lows last seen in May 2008,
according to Citigroup and data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 1.25 basis
points to 104.25 as of 9:00 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. The gauge ranged from 105.9 basis points to 123.1
in April, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  Markets in  Hong Kong  and  Singapore  are closed today for a
public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
