A case of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild
2010, a first-growth Pauillac wine estate, sold for 6,225 pounds
($9,690) on  London ’s Liv-ex market yesterday, an eight-month low
and 18 percent below its July 2011 peak, Liv-ex data showed.  The vintage fetched as much as 7,600 pounds a case on Liv-
ex in 2011 as demand for Bordeaux wines was peaking and dropped
below 5,800 pounds in August after investor appetite cooled. The
2010 vintage is the most expensive Mouton-Rothschild in merchant
listings since its 2000 wine, according to data on Liv-ex’s
Cellar Watch website.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Guy Collins in London at
