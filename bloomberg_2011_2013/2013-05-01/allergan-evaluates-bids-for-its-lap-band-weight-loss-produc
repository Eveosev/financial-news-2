Allergan Inc. (AGN) , the maker of the Botox
wrinkle treatment, fell as much as 14 percent after saying it
will delay further study of an experimental drug for age-related
macular degeneration. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., which
makes potential rival eye medicine Eylea, surged.  Allergan tumbled 9.1 percent to $103.19 at 11:23 a.m. New
York time, after declining to $98 in the biggest intraday drop
since November 2008.  David Pyott, the chief executive of  Irvine , California-
based Allergan, said on a conference call today that current
data donâ€™t support taking the medicine into the final stages of
trials needed for regulatory approval.  Regeneron jumped as much as 17 percent, and gained 12
percent to $240.79.  To contact the reporters on this story:
