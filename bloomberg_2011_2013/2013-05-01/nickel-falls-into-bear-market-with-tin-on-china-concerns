Nickel and tin prices in  London  joined
copper in a bear market as concern escalated that the economy is
slowing in  China , the world’s top user of industrial metal.  A Purchasing Managers Index in China, the second-biggest
economy, fell in April from March and trailed estimates by
analysts, a report showed today. In the U.S., manufacturing last
month expanded at the slowest pace in four months. A  gauge  of
six base metals tumbled to a 33-month low. Stimulus by central
banks may be having less impact on metal prices, said  Edward Meir , an analyst at INTL FCStone in  New York .  “Today’s weakness in base metals is largely attributable
to the poor Chinese PMI numbers that came out overnight,” Meir
said in a report. “Commodity investors do not seem to be
responding as they once were to easy money, but are instead
pining to see more evidence of growth setting in.”  Nickel for delivery in three months declined 3.7 percent to
settle at $14,825 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange. The
price tumbled more than 20 percent from the closing high of
$18,730 on Oct. 1, entering a bear market.  Tin fell 1.9 percent to $19,975 a ton. The price has
dropped 20 from the Jan. 18 close of $25,025.  On April 19, copper fell into a  bear market  on the LME.  A gauge measuring aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc, lead and
tin on the LME tumbled 3.2 percent to 2,976.9, the lowest since
July 5, 2010. The drop was the biggest since Dec. 14, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
