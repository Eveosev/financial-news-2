Cotton inventories at the end of July
2014 will be 11 percent higher than estimated last month as
production gains outpace improved demand, according to an
industry group.  Stockpiles will climb to 18.25 million metric tons, the
equivalent of about nine months of global mill use, and up from
16.44 million forecast a month earlier, the  International Cotton
Advisory Committee  said today in an e-mailed statement. In the
12 months that start Aug. 1, production will be 24.61 million,
up 4.9 percent from April’s projection, the Washington-based
group said. The consumption estimate was increased 2.3 percent
to 24.25 million tons.  Cotton has slumped 6.5 percent in the past year and is down
62 percent since reaching a record in March 2011 as supplies
outpaced waning demand. Imports by  China , the world’s biggest
consumer, will drop 19 percent to 3 million tons, ICAC
estimates.  On ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , cotton for July delivery
tumbled 4.1 percent to settle at 83.87 cents a pound today, the
biggest slump since June 21. Still, the fiber rallied 12 percent
this year partly on speculation that China will add to
government reserves. Next year’s global crop will be 6.6 percent
lower than a year earlier.  “Because of the Chinese national cotton reserve policy, a
seismic shift in the location of world cotton use is underway,”
the group said. “Decreased mill use in China will be partially
offset by increases in India,  Bangladesh , Turkey and  Pakistan .”  Cotlook Inc., which has published cotton news for more than
80 years, issues the Cotlook A Index, which reflects offer
prices for cargoes delivered to the  Far East . The index may
climb to $1.22 next season from 88 cents, ICAC forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
