Copper retreated after the biggest
monthly loss since May last year as  China ’s manufacturing
expanded at a weaker pace in April, increasing concern that
slowing growth will curb demand from the biggest consumer.  Copper for delivery in three months declined as much as 0.5
percent to $7,021 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $7,023.50 at 9:39 a.m. in Singapore. Nickel and zinc also
fell. Markets from China to India are closed today for a holiday.  The  Purchasing Managers ’  Index (CPMINDX)  was at 50.6, the National
Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said today. That compared with the 50.7 median
forecast of 31 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and a March
reading of 50.9. Copper slumped 6.4 percent in April on concern
slowing economies from the U.S. to China will reduce demand as
supplies expand.  “China slowing is going to be bad because the rest of the
world is already bad,” said  David Lennox , an analyst at Fat
Prophets in Sydney. “The price is reacting accordingly.”  China’s economic growth unexpectedly cooled in the first
quarter to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent in the final three
months of 2012. Aluminum and tin declined 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
