Liquidating Bernard L. Madoff’s
defunct brokerage has cost $774.8 million, including lawyers’
and consultants’ fees and expenses of $737.1 million, the
trustee for the firm said in a report.  Irving H. Picard, who has been liquidating the firm since
Madoff’s December 2008 arrest, has paid customers about
$4.6 billion, out of as much as $20 billion he says they lost in
the  Ponzi scheme . Another $802 million went to customers from
the Securities Investor Protection Corp., which spent almost as
much picking up the lawyers’ and consultants’ bills, according
to the report filed yesterday in federal court in Manhattan.  Picard, a bankruptcy lawyer whose firm has billed SIPC for
$440 million, files twice-yearly reports on his progress. Most
of the money he has raised in more than four years has come from
settlements with investors whom he accused of profiting from the
fraud.  He has been less successful in his pursuit of banks such as
JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  UBS AG (UBSN) ,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  UniCredit
SpA. (UCG)  Picard is appealing judges’ rulings that barred him from
demanding a total of about $30 billion from those banks on
behalf of Madoff customers.  The Madoff estate currently holds $4.4 billion of Treasury
securities and $173.7 million in cash, Picard said in the
report. Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence after
pleading guilty to running the biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S.
history.  The Madoff liquidation case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
Inc., 08-01789,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
