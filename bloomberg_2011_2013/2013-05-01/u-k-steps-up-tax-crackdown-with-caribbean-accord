The U.K. signed agreements with
territories including Anguilla, Bermuda and the British Virgin
Islands in the latest effort to fight  tax evasion  as the
government struggles to contain its borrowing.  All the British overseas territories with financial centers
signed up to the government’s effort, “marking a turning point
in the fight against tax evasion and illicit finance,” the
Treasury said in a statement in London today.  “This represents a significant step forward in tackling
illicit finance and sets the global standard in the fight
against tax evasion,” Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said in the statement. “I now hope others follow these
governments’ lead and enter into similar commitments to this new
level of transparency, removing the hiding places for those who
seek to evade tax and hide their assets.”  Last month, the U.K. government gave individuals evading
tax through the  Isle of Man , Guernsey and Jersey three years to
pay up or face prosecution. Under today’s agreement, the
territories will share the information with France, Germany,
Italy and Spain as well as the U.K.  Montserrat and the  Turks and Caicos Islands  have also
signed the agreement, the Treasury said. An accord is already in
place with the  Cayman Islands . The territories -- all in the
Caribbean -- have local autonomy, though Britain retains control
over their foreign relations and defense.  To contact the reporter on this story:
