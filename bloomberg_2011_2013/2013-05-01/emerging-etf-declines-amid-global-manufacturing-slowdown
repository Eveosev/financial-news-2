The exchange-traded  fund  tracking
developing-nation shares fell for the first time in three days
as manufacturing from China to the U.S. and Australia slowed,
sparking concern that the global economic recovery is faltering.  The iShares MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index dropped 0.9 percent
to $42.91 at 12:13 p.m. in  New York , after surging 2.5 percent
in two days. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index lost 0.1 percent to
1,038.18. Stock exchanges in  Latin America  and most European
markets were closed for a holiday. The Bloomberg China-US Equity
Index of the most-traded Chinese companies in the U.S. slid 0.8
percent to 92.28, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4
percent after rising to a record yesterday.  “The economic data has been weak across the board,”  Peter Jankovskis , who helps oversee $3 billion as co-chief investment
officer of Lisle, Illinois-based Oakbrook Investments LLC, said
by phone. The figures are “consistent with a slower growth
horizon for the world, which would have negative implications
for many emerging markets,” he said.  The ETF of developing nations followed American stocks
lower as data showed that manufacturing in the U.S. expanded in
April at the slowest pace in four months. The  Institute for
Supply Management ’s factory index fell to 50.7 from the prior
month’s 51.3. The median forecast of 84 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 50.5. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between
expansion and contraction.  China’s  manufacturing  expanded at a weaker pace in April in
a sign that the slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy
is extending into the second quarter. The  Purchasing Managers ’
Index was at 50.6, compared with the 50.7 median forecast of 31
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and a March reading of 50.9.
The Australian Industry Group said its manufacturing index
plunged 7.7 points to 36.7 last month, a four year low.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Emerging Markets ETF
Volatility Index, a  measure  of options prices on the fund and
expectations of price swings, jumped 8.5 percent to 20.10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
