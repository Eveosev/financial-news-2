More than 60 percent of new mothers in
their early 20s aren’t married, the U.S. government said today
in a report that underscores concern about the well-being of the
nation’s young children.  The total number of births to unwed mothers increased to 36
percent in 2011 from 31 percent in 2005, the earliest year for
which data are available, the U.S. Census Bureau said  in the
report . The bureau said 4.1 million women reported that they had
given birth in the year covered by the survey.  The high rate of children born to young, unwed mothers is
significant because the parents are more likely to have less
education and have lower incomes than married families. Their
children are likely to be poor and have developmental delays.  “The poorer developmental and behavioral outcomes
experienced by children living in cohabitating households may be
due in part to family instability,” the study’s authors wrote.
Forty percent of children will probably live in a broken family
before reaching the age of 15, they said.  The percentage of young unmarried new mothers contrasts
with the 17 percent of new mothers in their late 30s who aren’t
married. About 32 percent of new moms between the ages of 25 and
29 were single, the Census Bureau said.  The report showed wide variations in the number of births
to unwed mothers by income, race, state of residence and place
of birth. The share of unmarried mothers ranged from 69 percent
in households where income was less than $10,000 to 9 percent
for those earning more than $200,000.  Racial Divide  Almost 68 percent of new black mothers were unmarried. Only
11 percent of new Asian mothers were unwed, as were 26 percent
of non-Hispanic white mothers.  The percentage of native-born mothers who weren’t married
was 39 percent. About 24 percent of foreign-born new mothers
said they weren’t married.  More than half of new mothers in the  District of Columbia 
weren’t married. About 49 percent of new Louisiana mothers and
48 percent of new moms in Mississippi and New Mexico weren’t
married.  A handful of metropolitan areas had a significantly higher-
than-average number of unmarried recent mothers, including
Flagstaff, Arizona, 75 percent; Greenville,  North Carolina , 69
percent; and Lima, Ohio, 68 percent. Myrtle Beach,  South
Carolina , and Danville, Virginia, both ranked high, with 67
percent of unmarried recent mothers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
