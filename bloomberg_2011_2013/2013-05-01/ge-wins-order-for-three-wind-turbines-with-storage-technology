General Electric Co. (GE) , the biggest U.S.
supplier of  wind turbines , will supply three systems that
include battery storage to Invenergy LLC for a Texas wind farm.  The agreement is part of an 86-turbine order that Chicago-
based Invenergy plans to install at its Goldthwaite Wind Energy
facility in Mills County, Texas, GE said today in a statement.  It’s the first order for the 2.5-120 Brilliant turbine that
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE announced in January,
incorporating short-term power-storage capabilities. The system
uses software to analyze wind speeds and retains excess power
during gusty periods that’s fed to the grid when breezes wane.  Renewable-energy developers are showing increasing interest
in storage technology to offset the intermittent availability of
wind and sunshine, Keith Longtin, GE’s general manager for wind
products, said in the statement.  Integrating batteries in turbines will let wind-farm
operators boost “efficiency and short-term predictability,”
Longtin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
