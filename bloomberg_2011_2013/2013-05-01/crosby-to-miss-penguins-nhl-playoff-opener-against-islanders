All-Star center  Sidney Crosby  wasn’t
cleared by the Pittsburgh Penguins’ doctor to play in tonight’s
playoff opener against the New York Islanders after sitting out
the final 12 games of the  National Hockey League ’s regular
season with a broken jaw.  “He said everything looks good, he just wasn’t prepared to
clear me to play,” Crosby told reporters. “I would have loved
to have the chance to play tonight, but it’s not the way it is
and I’ll make sure I’m ready when the time comes.”  There’s no timetable for Crosby’s return. He was injured
during a March 30 game against the Islanders and didn’t return
to team practices until April 26. At the time of the injury,
Crosby led the NHL with 56 points, having recorded 15 goals and
a league-best 41 assists in 36 games for the Penguins, who are
the top seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs.  After tonight, the Penguins host the Islanders in Game 2 of
their best-of-seven series on May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
