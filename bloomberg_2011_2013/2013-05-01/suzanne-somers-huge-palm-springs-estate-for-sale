Few homes are private enough for a deckside soaking tub. Actress and spokeswoman  Suzanne Somers' Palm Springs home  sits atop a mountain, surrounded by 73 acres. On one of the many patios, a clawfoot tub sits surrounded by rocky outcrops, a gift, says listing agent  Joyce Rey , to Somers from producer-husband Alan Hamel. "She can take a bath out on the patio, and everything she sees, she owns," Rey said. Built in 1920, the Provincial-style home is perched above Palm Springs, "literally carved into the magnificent kind of desert, rocky landscape," said Rey, executive director of  Coldwell Banker Previews International , Greater LA. The house is currently listed for $14.5 million and is co-listed with Coldwell Banker Previews International agent John Nelson. Part of the  Palm Springs home 's privacy is due to the fact that the residence is accessed by funicular. "You drive into this motor court â€” and you go up the funicular into this romantic retreat," Rey said. The estate is made of five structures, including guest houses and an amphitheater for outdoor concerts, as well as a pool. Many of the rooms embrace indoor-outdoor living, flowing from indoor spaces to  outdoor patios . Measuring 10,000 square feet in total, the home has 11 baths, a two-room kitchen and wine vault. Somers and Hamel have owned the home for quite some time but are looking to sell, says Rey, as they are planning to build a new home in another area of Palm Springs. Palm Springs has long been a popular weekend retreat for people  living in Los Angeles , and in particular, the celebrity set. "This house is the ultimate celebrity retreat," Rey said.
