Eni SpA failed to buy Russian Urals
blend in the Mediterranean, bidding at an eight-month high. No
bids or offers were made for  North Sea  Forties crude.  Platts, the oil pricing agency, announced the first quality
premiums for Oseberg and Ekofisk, two of the four North Sea
crudes that form Dated Brent.  North Sea  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days widened by 5 cents to a discount of 40 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Trafigura Beheer BV yesterday purchased Forties lot F0522
from Vitol Group for loading May 21 to May 23 at a discount of
35 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, a Bloomberg survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.  Brent for June settlement traded at $99.05 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $102.14 in the previous session. The July contract was at
$98.64 at the same time today, a discount of 41 cents to June.  As of June 1, buyers will pay a premium 88.06 cents a
barrel for Ekofisk and 98.05 cents for Oseberg to sellers on
trades on the so-called “window,” Platts said today in a note
on its website. The changes are designed to take into account
their superior quality over Forties and Brent.  Mediterranean/Urals  Eni failed to buy 80,000 metric tons of Urals for loading
May 19 to May 23 at 15 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the Platts survey showed.
That is the same as the discount for a deal done yesterday,
which was the smallest since Aug. 20, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The company was unable to buy another Urals cargo of the
same size for loading on May 11 to May 15 at a discount of 55
cents to the benchmark, the survey showed.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
shrank by 2 cents to 13 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the narrowest since Jan. 24. In northwest
Europe, the  discount  was at 65 cents a barrel compared with 68
cents yesterday. That’s the smallest since Nov. 5, the data
show.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose 5 cents to $3.50 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
That’s the most since April 8.  Nigeria ’s output climbed 70,000 barrels to 1.88 million
barrels a day in April, according to a Bloomberg survey of  oil
companies , producers and analysts showed. The country pumped
1.81 million in March, the lowest level since September 2009.
Output is often disrupted by unrest in the Niger River delta,
the country’s main oil-producing region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
