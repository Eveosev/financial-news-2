Platts, the oil pricing agency,
announced the first quality premiums for two of the four North
Sea crudes that form Dated Brent, the benchmark used to price
more than half the world’s oil.  As of June 1, buyers will pay a premium 88.06 cents a
barrel for Ekofisk grade and 98.05 cents for Oseberg to sellers
on trades carried out during Platts so-called “window,” the
company said today in a  note  on its website. The changes are
designed to take into account their superior quality over the
other two grades, Forties and Brent, that make up Dated Brent.  These are the first quality premiums, or escalators, to be
published since the agency, which is a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos.,
said in March that it was introducing them to increase liquidity
in Dated Brent trades at a time of falling North Sea  production .
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , which was the first company to initiate
such amendments, also changed its SUKO-90 contract to mirror the
Platts formula. SUKO-90 has since 1990 acted as an industry
standard for the trading of all four grades.  Forties, which is the most abundant and cheapest of the
four grades and typically determines the benchmark price, is
subject to a de-escalator. This reduces its price depending on
the sulfur content of the grade. Sellers currently have to pay
25 cents a barrel for every 0.1 percentage point of sulfur on
Forties with more than 0.6 percent sulfur.  To contact the reporter on this story:
