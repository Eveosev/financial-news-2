Commodities dropped for a second day,
led by metals and oil, amid signs of an economic slowdown in
 China  and after a government report showed American crude
supplies surged to a record.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials 
fell as much as 2.6 percent to 608.08. It traded at 611.20 at
1:23 p.m. in New York. The GSCI touched 596.36 on April 18, the
lowest level since July 2. West Texas Intermediate crude,
gasoline, silver and copper tumbled more than 3 percent each,
while Brent and heating oil decreased more than 2 percent.  Commodities measured by the S&P GSCI declined after Chinese
manufacturing grew at a weaker pace in April. U.S. companies
added fewer workers than forecast in an ADP Research Institute
report. The U.S. Labor Department will publish April payrolls
data May 3. The selloff accelerated as the government reported
that U.S. crude supplies rose to 395.3 million barrels in the
seven days to April 26, the most in weekly data going back to
1982. They were last at this level in 1931 using monthly data.  “The data is building a very negative picture for
commodities,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital
LLC, a New York energy hedge fund. “First there were the
Chinese figures overnight that show a slowdown and the ADP
numbers, which are a warning shot about what Friday’s jobs
report will show. The large build in crude-oil inventories broke
the back of the recent commodity rally.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery decreased
as much as $3.35, or 3.6 percent, to $90.11 a barrel on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The contract was down 2.9 percent at
$90.86 at 1:23 p.m. Brent oil for June settlement dropped as
much as $3.61, or 3.5 percent, to $98.76 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Jeopardized Market  “We were looking for WTI to possibly test $98-or-$100
until these builds,” Kilduff said. “The $90 level is now in
jeopardy and we could soon be trading in the low $80s.”  U.S. crude stockpiles rose 6.7 million barrels last week,
the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, reported today. Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg expected a gain of 1.1 million.  Gasoline for June delivery slipped 8.48 cents, or 3
percent, to $2.7172 a gallon at 1:24 p.m. on the Nymex, and is
heading for the biggest decline since April 3. Heating oil for
June delivery dropped 5.44 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.7852 a
gallon in  New York .  Silver futures for July delivery were down 3.5 percent to
$23.345 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Prices slumped 15
percent last month, the most since December 2011.  Gold for June delivery retreated 1.8 percent to $1,445.80
an ounce on the Comex and is heading for the biggest drop since
April 15, when prices slumped the most in 33 years.  Copper futures for delivery in July declined 3.5 percent to
$3.075 a pound on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
