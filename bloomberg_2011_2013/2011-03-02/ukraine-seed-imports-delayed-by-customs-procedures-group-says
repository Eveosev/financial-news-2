Ukrainian customs procedures are
delaying importation of grain and sugar-beet seeds for the
spring sowing campaign, which may result in lower yields and
smaller harvests, the  Ukrainian Agribusiness Club Association 
and the Ukrainian Agrarian Confederation said.  Importers haven’t received necessary permissions to ship
the seeds “for a long time,” the industry groups said today in
a joint e-mailed statement. They also raised the issue in a
letter to Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov .  A shortage of high-quality seeds may see this year’s grain
harvest decline to 40 million metric tons, compared with an
earlier estimate for 45 million to 47 million tons, according to
the statement. Sugar beets may also have lower yields, they
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
