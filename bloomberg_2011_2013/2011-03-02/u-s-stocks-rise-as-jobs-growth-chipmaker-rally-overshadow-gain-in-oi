U.S. stocks rose after a private
report showed companies added more jobs than forecast last month
and  Texas Instruments Inc . led a rally in chipmakers,
overshadowing concern surging energy prices will hurt growth.  Texas Instruments climbed 3.5 percent to lead semiconductor
companies to the top advance among 24 industries after JPMorgan
Chase & Co. raised its rating on the industry. Walt Disney Co.
and Verizon Communications Inc. led gains in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average .  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index climbed 0.3 percent to
1,309.56 at 10:02 a.m. in New York. The Dow rose 25.85 points,
or 0.2 percent, to 12,083.87. Stocks also gained as oil
retreated from its high of the day, rising 0.7 percent to
$100.29 a barrel after climbing as much as 1.9 percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
