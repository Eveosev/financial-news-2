HSH Nordbank AG, the regional German
lender that was bailed out during the global financial crisis,
will start repaying state guarantees in 2011 after reporting its
first annual profit in three years on lower loan losses.  Net income in 2010 reached 48 million euros ($66 million),
compared with a net loss of 743 million euros a year earlier,
the Hamburg- and Kiel-based bank said in a statement today. The
company last posted a profit in 2007.  “The main reasons for this positive trend were the global
economic upturn combined with decreasing charges in the lending
business as a result of resolute portfolio revamping,” the
lender said.  The German states of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, which
 together control  more than 80 percent of Nordbank, provided the
company with 3 billion euros in capital and 10 billion euros in
guarantees to cover potential losses during the crisis. Nordbank
also tapped  Germany ’s Soffin bank-rescue fund for 17 billion
euros in guarantees. The lender said today it will repay the two
states guarantees of 1 billion euros in the first quarter.  HSH Nordbank last year cut its total assets by 13 percent
to 151 billion euros. The lender’s Tier 1 capital ratio, a
measure of financial strength, rose to 15.4 percent at the end
of last year, compared with 9.5 percent at the end of 2009.  The bank’s restructuring unit, where the company placed
loans not regarded as part of its main business, reported a loss
before restructuring expenses of 29 million euros. That compares
with a loss of 1.07 billion euros in 2009, HSH Nordbank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
