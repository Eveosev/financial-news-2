Ghana ’s domestic currency was
unchanged against the dollar after a sale of foreign currency by
the West African nation’s central bank halted a three-day slide
in the cedi.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
traded at 1.5180 as of 1:36 p.m. in Accra, according to data
from Standard Bank Group Ltd., unchanged from its closing price
yesterday.  The  Bank of Ghana  sold between $20 million and $25 million
to Ghanaian banks in its regular currency sale, according to
Chris Nettey, a trader with Standard Bank’s Accra-based unit.  No one was immediately available to comment at the Bank of  Ghana ’s treasury department, according to a man who answered the
phone and did not identify himself.  To contact the reporter on this story:
