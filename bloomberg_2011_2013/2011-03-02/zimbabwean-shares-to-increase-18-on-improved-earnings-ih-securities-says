Zimbabwean stocks will probably rise
18 percent this year as earnings are poised to improve in the
second half, said Dzika Danha, an analyst at Harare-based  Inter-
Horizons Securities Ltd.   The company expects the market to “move sideways” in the
first half of the year, with traders and investors uncertain
about the political situation in Zimbabwe, Danha said by phone
today.  “We are, however, bullish on the second half and expect
the market to rise on the back of improved corporate earnings,”
Inter-Horizons, also known as IH Securities, said in a separate
e-mailed statement from Harare.  The forecast is based on the weighted evaluation of 12
companies, representing 67 percent of the total market
capitalization of the  Zimbabwe Stock Exchange , IH Securities
said. Zimbabwe’s economic recovery after a decade of recession
is hampered by low foreign direct investment, which fell 19
percent last year, IH Securities said.  The company initiated coverage of  Aico Africa Ltd ., CBZ
Holdings Ltd., Delta Corp., and  Lafarge Cement Zimbabwe Ltd .
