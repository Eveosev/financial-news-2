The U.K. should to do more to
protect retail customers as it scraps the  Financial Services
Authority , a consumer group said today.  The Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K.’s proposed
consumer protection agency, must “do a better job than the FSA
in ensuring consumers are both adequately protected and
informed,” the chief of  London ’s top financial customer rights
group said.  “Only with a more effective regulator will consumers begin
to trust financial services providers again,” Adam Phillips,
chairman of the Financial Services Consumer Panel, said in a
speech in London today.  The government is pushing through the biggest shake-up in
financial regulation since 1997, scrapping the FSA and splitting
its powers between a new regulator within the  Bank of England 
and a markets watchdog by 2012.  The FSA, the U.K.’s financial regulator, is increasing its
focus on consumer protection.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, said last month it agreed
with the FSA to pay Halifax mortgage clients 500 million pounds
($815 million) because the terms of their loans were unclear.  To contact the reporters for this story:
