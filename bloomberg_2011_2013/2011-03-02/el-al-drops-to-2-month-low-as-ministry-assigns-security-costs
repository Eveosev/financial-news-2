  El Al Israel Airlines  slumped to the
lowest level in more than two months as Minister of Transport
and Road Safety Israel Katz said the company was responsible for
covering security costs until a new government agency is formed.  The shares of Israelâ€™s largest carrier fell 4.4 percent to
1.40 shekels, the lowest since Dec. 15. at the 4:30 p.m close in  Tel Aviv .  The ministry said it plans to present a plan for the
formation of the agency by the end of March. El Al has said the
government should assume all responsibility and costs for
aviation security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
