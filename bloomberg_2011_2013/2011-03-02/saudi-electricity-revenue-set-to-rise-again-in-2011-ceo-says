  Saudi Electricity Co ., the state-
controlled power producer, expects a percentage revenue increase
this year similar to that in 2010, Chief Executive Officer Ali Al-Barrak said.  The company’s revenue “grows 6 percent every year,” Al-
Barrak told reporters at the Saudi Economic Forum in Riyadh
today. “We are trying to control our costs.”    Saudi Arabia , the largest Arab economy, is expanding its
electricity capacity to meet a growing population and demand
from industry. Power demand will probably increase by 8 percent
a year, Al-Barrak said on Oct. 4.  Saudi Electricity’s shares dropped as much as 3.6 percent,
and were down 0.8 percent at 12.40 riyals as of 2:59 p.m. in
Riyadh today. The stock has lost 12 percent since the start of
the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
