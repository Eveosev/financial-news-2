  DZ Bank  Group,  Germany ’s largest
cooperative bank, said full-year profit more than tripled on
higher earnings from lending and fewer loan-loss provisions.  Net income rose to 1.13 billion euros ($1.56 billion) from
346 million euros, the Frankfurt-based company said in a
statement on its  website  today. Net interest income gained 14
percent to 2.73 billion euros, and the lender set aside 62
percent less for soured loans. Net fee and commission income
climbed 27 percent to 1.11 billion euros, DZ Bank said.  DZ Bank, which acts as a central bank for about 1,000
cooperative lenders in Germany, raised its Tier 1 capital ratio,
a measure of financial strength, to 10.6 percent from 9.9
percent. Regulators from 27 nations last year agreed to more
than double  capital requirements  for banks to help avert future
financial crises.  “We got off to a good start in the new financial year,”
Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Kirsch said in the statement.
“But we assume that the business outlook for the DZ Bank Group
will improve yet further in 2011.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
