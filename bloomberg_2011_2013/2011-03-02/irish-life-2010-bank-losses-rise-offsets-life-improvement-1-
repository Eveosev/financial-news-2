  Irish Life  & Permanent Plc said its
full-year operating loss was little changed at 197 million euros
($271 million) as a profit increase at its life business was
offset by a widening deficit in its banking unit.  Profit at the life division climbed 57 percent to 160
million euros, the country’s largest life assurance company said
in a  statement  today. The banking unit’s loss swelled 36 percent
to 364 million euros on higher impairments. The division set
aside 420 million euros for soured loans in 2010, up from 376
million euros a year earlier.  Irish Life, based in Dublin, is the nation’s only
government-guaranteed lender not to be bailed out over the past
two years. It was told by the central bank last year to raise an
additional  243 million euros  of capital by the end of May. The
central bank is stress testing Irish lenders for further loan
losses by the end of March, with the focus on mortgage
impairments.  Capital and liquidity reviews by the central bank will
“determine what is required of the bank in terms of
deleveraging and capital adequacy and create a sustainable
business going forward,” said Kevin Murphy, Irish Life’s chief
executive officer.  The company said the share of its Irish home borrowers who
are more than 90 days behind in payments rose to 6.8 percent in
2010 from 3.9 percent in 2009.  Losses in the banking company should “moderate” this
year, while the outcome in the life unit may be slightly better
compared with 2010, David McCarthy, Irish Life’s finance
director, said on a call with reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
