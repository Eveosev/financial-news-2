Russia’s population shrank last year
after a 66 percent surge in immigration failed to offset the
country’s “natural decline,” according to the  Federal
Statistics Service .  The population fell by 7,400 people in 2010 from the
previous year, the Moscow-based service said today in an e-
mailed statement, without giving the total number. It rose by
23,300 to 141.9 million in 2009, ending 14 years of declines,
statics service data showed in February 2010. Deaths exceeded
births by 241,400 people last year, compared with a difference
of 248,800 in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
