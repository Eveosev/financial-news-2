  Total SA  said output at the onshore
Mabruk field in  Libya  is likely to halt amid civil unrest, while
production at the offshore al-Jurf field continues as normal.  Fighting and protests in the North African country have
disrupted production several times at Mabruk, Yves-Louis Darricarrere, Total’s head of exploration and production, said
today in Paris.  “Progressively it will be stopped,” Darricarrere said of
the 50,000 barrel-a-day field. That includes output allocated to
Libya’s National Oil Corp., which owns half of the operating
company, said Phenelope Semavoine, a Paris-based spokeswoman.  Libyan oil production has fallen by as much as 1 million
barrels a day, or by two-thirds, because of civil unrest,
according to the  International Energy Agency , as companies
including BASF SE’s Wintershall and  ConocoPhillips  close fields
and evacuate expatriate workers.  Total’s offshore al-Jurf field is operating normally,
Darricarrere said. Total’s usual share of output from all its
Libyan operations is 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day,
Semavoine said. Oil equivalent figures include natural gas.
Paris-based Total owns 37.5 percent in Mabruk’s operating
company, Semavoine said.  Crude oil in New York climbed above $100 a barrel for a
second day on concern that the unrest curbing exports from Libya
will spread to other countries in the region. The contract for
April delivery surged 2.7 percent to $99.63 yesterday, the
highest settlement since September 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
