Sociedad Quimica y Minera de  Chile 
SA, Chile’s largest fertilizer producer, rose as higher potash
prices boosted fourth-quarter profit.  Net income rose 34 percent to $105.8 million, beating the
$94 million estimate of Hernan Guerrero, head of research of the
local brokerage unit of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in
Chile. The Santiago-based company’s Ebitda increased 39 percent
to $189 million, compared with Guerrero’s forecast of $180
million.  Soquimich sold potash at an average of $390 per ton in 2010
and may sell it at an average of at least $420 per ton this
year, Guerrero said. Fourth quarter revenue advanced 31 percent
to $505.7 million from a year earlier, the company said in a
statement. For 2010, net income rose to $382.1 million from
$338.3 million a year earlier and sales gained 27 percent to
$1.83 billion.  “Soquimich is selling at higher prices and getting higher
volumes,” Guerrero said in a phone interview. “This industry
is really starting to recover from 2009. This was a very good
quarter.”  The shares rose 1.3 percent to 25,211 pesos at 4 p.m. New
York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
