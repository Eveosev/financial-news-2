Trading in the credit-default swaps
of developing nations rose 22 percent in 2010, led by bets on
the creditworthiness of  Brazil , according to New York-based
trade group EMTA.  There were $1.45 trillion of trades last year, compared
with $1.19 trillion in 2009, the association of emerging-market
traders said in a statement on its  website  today. Transactions
amounted to $208 billion in the fourth quarter, 41 percent less
than a year earlier, it said. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a government or company fail to adhere to its
debt agreements.  Contracts protecting against a default by Brazil were the
most actively traded sovereign contracts last year with $43
billion of turnover, EMTA said. There were $22 billion of trades
in Turkey’s credit-default swaps and $17 billion in  Mexico ’s.  Russia’s gas-export monopoly OAO Gazprom dominated trading
in corporate credit-default swaps with transactions totalling $7
billion. Contracts linked to  Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin
America’s biggest oil producer, had turnover of $3 billion, EMTA
said.  EMTA said its  survey  was based on data collected from 12
banks and broker-dealers for volumes traded on 19 sovereign
issuers and 10 corporate issuers in developing nations. It was
based on the notional value of credit-default swap trades, EMTA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
