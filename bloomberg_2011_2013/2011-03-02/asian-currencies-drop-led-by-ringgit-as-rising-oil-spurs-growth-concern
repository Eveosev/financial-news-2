Asian currencies weakened, led by
Malaysia’s ringgit and the Philippine peso, on speculation
higher  oil prices  will derail the global economic recovery and
damp demand for emerging-market assets.  Crude rallied past $100 a barrel in  New York  to trade near
a two-year high as an uprising in Libya, holder of Africa’s
largest oil reserves, spurred concern supplies of the fuel will
be disrupted. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
yesterday a sustained jump in commodity prices may slow economic
growth and boost inflation.  “Higher oil prices are negative for growth and this
affects sentiment in the market,” said Ahmad Zubaidi Samse, a
currency trader at Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
Raising fuel prices or cutting subsidies “will also be harder
and unpopular now,” he said.  The ringgit dropped 0.3 percent to 3.0390 per dollar as of
4:40 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The peso retreated 0.2 percent to 43.51 and
Indonesia’s rupiah declined 0.2 percent to 8,815.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares slumped 1.4 percent,
the most since Feb. 22. Global funds sold $5.3 billion more
Indian, South Korean and Thai equities than they bought so far
this year, exchange data show. Oil rose as high as $100.64 a
barrel before paring gains to trade 0.1 percent stronger at
$99.75.  Fuel Subsidies  Crude prices have surged 18 percent since Feb. 15, and
Deutsche Bank AG estimates a sustained increase of $10 a barrel
would cut growth in the  U.S. economy  by 0.5 percent over two
years.  The ringgit snapped a three-day gain on concern the surge
in oil prices will crimp growth and hurt the government’s
efforts to trim its  budget deficit . The country raised fuel
prices twice last year, stoking inflation, in efforts to claw
back $24 billion in annual subsidies.  China’s yuan fell for the first time in four days after
the central bank set its reference rate for trading 0.05 percent
weaker at 6.5736 per dollar. Asia’s largest economy imported 54
percent of its oil needs in 2010, according to the China
Petroleum & Chemical Industry Association.  “The unrest continues to drive investors into a risk-off
mode,” said  Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . “The yuan fell on poor market
sentiment.”  The yuan declined 0.04 percent to 6.5727, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.5654 on Feb.
21, the strongest level since  China  unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Elsewhere, the  Singapore  dollar fell 0.1 percent to
S$1.2712 versus the greenback, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Taiwan’s dollar and Thailand’s baht were little
changed at NT$29.665 and 30.55 respectively. South Korea’s won
strengthened 0.1 percent to 1,128.25 after a public holiday
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
