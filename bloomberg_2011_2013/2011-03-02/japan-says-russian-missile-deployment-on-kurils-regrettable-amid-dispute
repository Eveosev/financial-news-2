Japan condemned a report that  Russia 
will strengthen its military capability on islands claimed by
both countries by deploying missiles and attack helicopters.  Russia will install its Tor-M2 anti-aircraft system and
Mi-28N attack helicopters in the Southern Kurils, Interfax
agency reported yesterday, citing an unidentified General Staff
official. The announcement came days after Defense Minister
Anatoly Serdyukov said the military won’t boost troop levels on
the islands, known as the Northern Territories in Japan.  “The military build-up on four Northern Territory islands
contradicts our stance, and we consider this very regrettable,”
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters
today in Tokyo.  Tensions have risen since President  Dmitry Medvedev  in
November became the first Russian leader to visit the islands.
The  Soviet Union  seized the chain six miles (10 kilometers) from
Japan’s Hokkaido Island at the end of World War II, and the
sovereignty dispute has prevented the two sides from signing a
formal peace treaty.  Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara last month ahead of
a visit to Moscow criticized Russian plans to beef up its
defenses on the islands. Medvedev on Feb. 9 said the build-up
was necessary to defend them as “an unalienable part of the
Russian Federation.”  The chain lies near Sakhalin Island, where Russia ships
liquefied natural gas to Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
