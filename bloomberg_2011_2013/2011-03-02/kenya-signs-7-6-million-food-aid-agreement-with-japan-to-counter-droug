  Kenya  will receive a 629.5 million
shilling ($7.6 million) grant from Japan to import about 35,000
metric tons of corn, the east African nation’s staple food,
Agriculture Minister Sally Kosgei said.  “This grant will go a long way toward supplementing the
ongoing efforts by the government in tackling hunger in the
affected parts of the country,” Kosgei told reporters in
Kenya’s capital Nairobi today.  Kenya experienced drier-than-usual weather in October
through December because of the La Nina phenomenon, which occurs
when the surface of the Pacific Ocean cools and reduces moisture
in the atmosphere. The drought has disrupted food supplies in
the northern, eastern and coastal regions,  Japanese Ambassador
to Kenya  Toshihisa Takata said today.  The countries plan to purchase the corn shipment by August,
he said.  The weather system may curb rainfall during East Africa’s
March to May rainy season,  Oxfam  said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “The crisis is therefore expected to peak during and after
the next rainy season,” the U.K.-based charity said. “Given
the current situation, it is possible that this could lead to
catastrophic conditions for several million people across the
region.”  The governments of Somalia and Ethiopia have declared
states of emergency due to drought, Oxfam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
