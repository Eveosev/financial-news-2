  UCB SA , the maker of the Cimzia
arthritis drug, forecast earnings will drop as much as 20
percent this year as the epilepsy medicine Keppra faces generic
competition in  Europe  and drug development costs increase.  Per-share profit excluding special items will drop to 1.65
euros ($2.27), plus or minus 5 cents, from 1.99 euros, the
Brussels-based company said today in a statement. Profit last
year beat the 1.81-euro average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Revenue will decline to about 3.05 billion euros
from 3.22 billion euros last year.  UCB’s top-selling medicine Keppra lost patent protection at
the end of September in the European Union, where sales of the
epilepsy drug climbed 11 percent to 606 million euros last year.
The emergence of lower-priced copies may offset the anticipated
increase in revenue for Cimzia, Vimpat and Neupro, which had
combined 2010 sales of 413 million euros. UCB is also facing
increasing development costs as late-stage trials of the
epilepsy drug brivaracetam and the lupus medicine epratuzumab
started in December.  “Generic competition to Keppra will be the key factor and
we expect management will need to guide cautiously, in case
generic launch is imminent,” Mark Purcell and Brian Bourdot,
analysts at  Barclays Capital  in  London , wrote in a preview note.
They had estimated 2010 per-share profit of 1.91 euros and have
an “underweight” rating on the shares.  Operating Expenses  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization
and one-time items may drop to 665 million euros, plus or minus
15 million euros, from 731 million euros last year, UCB said.
That compares with analyst projections of 681 million euros for
2011, the average of 20 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Operating expenses rose 4 percent to 1.7 billion euros last
year and net financial expenditure increased 14 percent to 185
million euros. Special items included a $8.6 million fine as
well as a $25.8 million settlement, excluding accrued interest,
following an agreement in principle with the U.S. Justice
Department about an investigation into the marketing of Keppra
six years ago.  UCB declined 0.3 percent to 26.86 euros at the 5:35 p.m.
close of trading on Euronext Brussels yesterday. The shares have
gained 4.6 percent since the start of the year, compared with a
0.5 percent advance for the 34-company Stoxx 600 Health Care
Index in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
