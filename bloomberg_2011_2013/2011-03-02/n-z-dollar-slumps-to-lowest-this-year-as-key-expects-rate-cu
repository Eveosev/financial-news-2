  New Zealand ’s dollar dropped to the
lowest this year after Prime Minister John Key said he’d
“welcome” an interest-rate cut to bolster the economy
following last month’s earthquake in Christchurch.  The kiwi slid to the weakest in more than 18 years against
Australia’s currency as traders added to bets the Reserve Bank
of New Zealand will reduce borrowing costs. The Australian
dollar rose against the greenback as  Australia ’s gross domestic
product expanded 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter from the
previous three months, when it grew a revised 0.1 percent, the
Bureau of Statistics said today.  “There have been rumors and talk of a rate cut,” said  Mitul Kotecha , head of global foreign-exchange strategy in  Hong
Kong  at Credit Agricole SA, a unit of France’s second-largest
lender by total assets. “These comments helped reinforce these
rumors and again provide a more negative bias for the New
Zealand dollar.”  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.6 percent to 74.26 U.S. cents
as of 12:19 p.m. in  New York  from yesterday, after slipping to
73.84 cents, the lowest since Dec. 20. The currency declined 0.9
percent to 60.63 yen.  Australia’s dollar rose 0.2 percent to $1.0158. It traded
at 82.93 yen from 82.95 yen.  Central Bank Watch  Traders are certain New Zealand’s central bank will cut its
benchmark by 25 basis points at its meeting on March 10, with
some betting on a 50-basis point reduction, according to a
Credit Suisse Group AG index based on swaps.  “We’d certainly welcome” a rate cut, Key said in an
interview in Wellington. “The market has priced in a cut from
the Reserve Bank. That would probably be my expectation, that
the  Reserve Bank  would cut, but it’s for them to determine
that.”  New Zealand is grappling with the human and financial toll
of a 6.3-magnitude earthquake that struck the South Island city
of Christchurch on Feb. 22, the second major temblor in six
months. The two quakes may have caused as much as NZ$20 billion
($14.8 billion) of damage, Key said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
