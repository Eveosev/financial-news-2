The  Central Bank  of  Syria  will allow
airlines to transfer money abroad without bank approval as part
of a drive to encourage more companies to operate in the nation.  The central bank will also permit companies to sell tickets
in Syrian pounds to Syrian citizens, the bank said in a
statement.  Foreigners will have to pay in hard currency for their
tickets, it said. The regulations are effective immediately.  To contact the reporter on this story:
