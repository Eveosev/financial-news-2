The pound’s ascent to a 13-month
high against the dollar yesterday shows investors are betting
Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  won’t be able to keep
interest rates from rising, according to  RBC Capital Markets .  “King has been outvoted twice since 2003, and each uptick
in the pound, against King’s cautiousness, seems to reinforce
that the market either sees King being offside again, or
capitulating,” David Watt, a Toronto-based senior currency
strategist at the unit of Royal Bank of Canada, wrote in a
research note today. “The market seems to continue to set the
stage for Bank of England tightening.”  The pound fell 0.3 percent to $1.6227 as of 6:37 a.m. in
London, after reaching $1.6330 yesterday, the strongest level
since Jan. 20, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
