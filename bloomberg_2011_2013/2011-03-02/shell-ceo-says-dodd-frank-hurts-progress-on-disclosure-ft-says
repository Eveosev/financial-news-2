  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  Chief
Executive Officer Peter Voser said the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act,
legislation requiring more transparency from U.S.-listed
companies about payments they make to governments, could derail
progress already made in disclosures between  oil companies  and
states, the Financial Times reported, citing Voser.  The new rules treat “foreign governments not only as
irrelevant, but as a problem not a solution,” the FT said,
citing Voser at a conference in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
