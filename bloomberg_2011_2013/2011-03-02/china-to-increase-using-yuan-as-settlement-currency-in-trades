China will widen the trial use of
yuan to settle international trade to the entire country from 20
provinces, the People’s Bank of  China  said.  The central bank will also “actively respond” to foreign
countries seeking to use the yuan as a reserve currency, and
will help overseas companies raise yuan-denominated capital for
investments outside China, according to today’s statement.  “Cross-market yuan-related business will develop further,
as market demand rises,” the central bank said. Monetary
authorities should be “orderly” in relaxing controls on cross-
border capital trading and increase risk controls, it said.  China is promoting global use of the yuan after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in March he is “worried” about holdings of dollar-
denominated assets. Cross-border yuan trade settlement was 506.3
billion yuan ($77 billion) last year, the PBOC said today.  China approved 29.2 billion yuan of interbank bond market
quotas for five foreign institutional investors as of December,
the central bank said.  --William Bi. Editor: Joshua Fellman, Steven Fromm  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
