Guinea’s government has prevented  Russia ’s United Co. Rusal from exporting alumina from the port
of Conakry,  Reuters  said, citing an unidentified company worker.  Guinean authorities were reacting to alleged pollution
caused by an alumina leakage at Fria, where the Friguia refinery
is based, 160 kilometers (99 miles) from the capital, Conakry,
the news agency said.  The Friguia refinery produces about 640,000 metric tons of
alumina a year, Reuters reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
