Designer drugs that mimic the
effects of marijuana and other illegal substances are spreading
“out of control,” a United Nations group reported today.  “Given the health risks posed by the abuse of designer
drugs, we urge governments to adopt national control measures to
prevent the manufacture, trafficking in and abuse of these
substances,” Hamid Ghodse, President of the  International
Narcotics Control Board  said in a statement from Vienna.  Makers of designer drugs modify the molecular structures of
substances to bypass laws against illegal narcotics. Certain
types of “fake pot” that can provide marijuana-like highs were
banned under U.S.  rules  that took effect yesterday, according to
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.  The chemicals, designed to mimic THC, the active ingredient
in marijuana, have gained popularity, especially among teens and
young adults, according to the DEA. Products are sold under such
brand names as Spice, Red X Dawn and K2 and are sold over the
Internet, according to the 160-page narcotics board report.  U.S. consumption of traditional illicit drugs is rising as
the country represents the main destination for cocaine, heroin,
marijuana and methamphetamines, the report said. Marijuana use
has dropped in  France , Italy and  Spain  while remaining stable
across the rest of  Europe .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
