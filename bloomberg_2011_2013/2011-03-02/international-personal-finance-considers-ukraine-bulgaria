  International Personal Finance Plc ,
a U.K. lender that makes unsecured loans to low-income
households in central and eastern  Europe  and  Mexico , may start
operating in Ukraine and  Bulgaria  this year.  “Ukraine and Bulgaria are our top priorities,” Chief
Executive Officer John Harnett said in a telephone interview.
“Our focus is on emerging markets and we are trying to find
markets that are moving into the growth phase.”  Net income jumped 80 percent to 59.2 million pounds ($96.2
million), or 23.1 pence a share, in 2010 from 32.8 million
pounds, or 17.7 pence, a year earlier, the Leeds, England-based
company said in a statement today.  Revenue rose 11 percent to 608.7 million pounds.
Impairments for non-repayment of loans rose 2.3 percent to 168.1
million pounds.  International Personal Finance typically makes loans of 200
pounds to 500 pounds at interest rates of as much as 25 percent,
Harnett said.  The shares were down 8 pence, or 2.4 percent, to 322 pence
at the 4:30 p.m. close of London trading, paring the gain in the
last six months to 31 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
