  Thailand ’s baht weakened for the
first time in three days as political turmoil in the Middle East
pushed up oil prices, raising concern global economic growth
will slow.  Crude for April delivery rallied past $100 a barrel and U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday a
sustained jump in the price of oil threatened to cause slower
growth and higher inflation. Rising commodity costs resulted in
Thailand’s current-account surplus shrinking to $1.09 billion in
January from $1.75 billion in December, the central bank said
last month. The country has raised borrowing costs four times
since June.  “Thailand relies on imported oil, so higher crude prices
will be negative for the current account,” said  Vishnu Varathan ,
an economist in Singapore at  Capital Economics    Asia ) Pte.
“Inflation is becoming a big concern. We believe the Bank of
Thailand will continue to tighten.”  The baht fell 0.1 percent to 30.58 per dollar as of 9:42
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency earlier rose by as much as 0.2 percent to 30.49.  Consumer prices rose 2.87 percent in February from a year
earlier, easing from a five-month high of 3.03 percent the
previous month, a commerce ministry report said yesterday.  Bank of Thailand policy makers raised the one-day bond
repurchase rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25 percent on
Jan. 12. They next meet on March 9.
