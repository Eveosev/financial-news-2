Gunvor International BV , the closely
held energy trader, will close its European power desk and the
three traders in the team will leave or have already left,
Stuart Leasor, a company spokesman, said by telephone.  Gunvor, which began European electricity trading in January
2010 as part of its expansion beyond oil markets, decided to
exit power “due to the current difficult market conditions,”
the Amsterdam-based company that has its main trading office in
Geneva, said today in an e-mailed statement, without providing
further details.  Paymon Aliabadi resigned in December as the company’s head
of the global energy division, in charge of building out trading
in electricity, natural gas, coal, freight and emissions.  The decision to shut power trading doesn’taffect the
company’s other activities, including Gunvor’s natural-gas
business, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
