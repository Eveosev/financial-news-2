  Ecuador , OPEC’s smallest member,
aims to boost oil production by about a fifth by 2013 to take
advantage of surging crude prices, said Wilson Pastor, minister
of non-renewable natural resources.  Ecuador plans to boost crude output to 600,000 barrels a
day from 508,000 barrels now, Pastor said today at Bloomberg’s
Ecuador Economic Summit in Quito. Block 31 and an expansion at
the Sacha field in the eastern Amazon jungle will come online by
2013 as part of $1.5 billion in planned state oil investments in
the next two years, he said.  “Both state and private companies need to increase oil
production,” Pastor said. “We’ll also call for bids in October
on a dozen new areas on Peru’s border where there are signs of
major reserves.”  Ecuador, which in November seized concessions from
Brazilian state-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and three
other crude producers, is trying to offset two years of output
declines.  Private  oil companies , which produce 145,000 barrels a day
in Ecuador, may invest $450 million in coming years, Jose Luis
Ziritt, president of the Ecuadorean oil industry association,
said at the same conference.  “Private oil companies have suffered a great deal over the
past four years with changing conditions,” Ziritt said. “The
new contract terms have now set a clear timeline for
investment.”  Crude oil for April delivery rose $2.60 to settle at
$102.23 a barrel, on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest closing price since Sept. 26, 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Alex Emery  in Quito at
