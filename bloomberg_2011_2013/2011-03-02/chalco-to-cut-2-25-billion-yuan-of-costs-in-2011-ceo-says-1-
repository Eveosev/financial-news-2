Aluminum Corp. of  China  Ltd., the
countryâ€™s biggest producer of the metal, plans to cut 2.25
billion yuan ($342 million) in costs this year, Chief Executive
Xiong Weiping said at a briefing in Hong Kong today.  Chalco, as the company is known, will cut costs by 300
million yuan by reducing consumption of raw materials and fuel.
It will also cut 700 million yuan from procurement costs, Xiong
told reporters. Technology upgrades, direct power purchases and
expense controls will also help cut costs, he said.  Chalco posted a lower-than-expected 2010 profit yesterday
as higher aluminum prices were undercut by coal, electricity and
bauxite costs. Benchmark coal prices in China have gained more
than 34 percent in the past 12 months, Bloomberg data shows.  Higher aluminum prices will help boost profit and improve
gross margins, Chief Financial Officer Liu Caiming said today.
Still, increasing inflation may raise operational costs, said
Liu, who was appointed in February after Joshua Chen resigned.  Chalco closed down 1.2 percent at HK$7.29 in  Hong Kong 
trading, the lowest since Jan. 17. In Shanghai trading, the
stock fell 1.4 percent.  --Bei Hu and Xiao Yu. Editor: Alan Soughley.  To contact the reporter for this story:
