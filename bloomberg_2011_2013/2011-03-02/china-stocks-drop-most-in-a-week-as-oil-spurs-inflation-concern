China stocks fell, driving the
benchmark index down by the most in a week, on concern inflation
will accelerate as crude prices topped $100 a barrel.    Air China Ltd . and China Southern Airlines Co. declined at
least 2 percent on speculation higher jet-fuel costs will hurt
margins. China Vanke Co. paced losses by developers after Xinhua
News Agency said Beijing home sales tumbled last month. China
Railway Construction Corp., builder of more than half the
nation’s rail links since 1949, retreated 3.3 percent after
halting projects in Libya.  “Imported inflationary pressure is increasing in China now
with  oil prices  surging,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West
China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “That’ll cause concerns the
government will further tighten measures to curb inflation.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, lost 5.11, or 0.2 percent, to 2,913.81
at the 3 p.m. close, the biggest loss since Feb. 22. The  CSI 300
Index  declined 0.4 percent to 3,243.30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
