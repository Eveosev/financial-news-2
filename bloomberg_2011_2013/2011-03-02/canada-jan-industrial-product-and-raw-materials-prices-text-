The following is the text of
the industrial product and raw material prices report as
reported by  Statistics Canada .  In January, the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI)
inched up 0.2% and the Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI)
edged up 0.3%. Both indexes posted slower growth compared
with previous months.  The IPPI was up for the sixth consecutive month,
inching up 0.2% in January following increases of 0.5% in
November and 0.8% in December. The gain in January was led
mainly by petroleum and coal products (+2.2%) and, to a
lesser extent, by primary metal products (+0.8%) and
fruits, vegetables, feeds and other food products (+0.5%).  Higher prices for petroleum and coal products in
January were supported largely by uncertainties concerning
world oil supplies and stronger demand, due in part to
more positive economic activity and colder weather.  In January, the largest contributors to the increase in
primary metal products were copper and copper alloy
products (+3.9%) and nickel products (+4.9%). Copper and
nickel prices were sustained by lower production and
robust demand. Nickel was in high demand in the  steel
industry . The increase in the primary metal products price
index was moderated by lower prices for precious metals.  The IPPI advance was moderated by a 0.8% decline in
prices for motor vehicles and other transportation
equipment. The decrease was due mostly to a 1.4%
appreciation in the Canadian dollar relative to the US
dollar.  Some Canadian producers who export their products to
the  United States  are generally paid on the basis of
prices set in US dollars. Consequently, the strength of
the Canadian dollar in relation to the US dollar had the
effect of reducing the corresponding prices in Canadian
dollars. Without the impact of the exchange rate, the IPPI
would have risen 0.5% instead of 0.2%.  In January, if petroleum and coal prices were excluded,
the IPPI would have remained unchanged.  12-month change in the IPPI: The upward trend continues  The IPPI rose 2.7% in January compared with the same
month a year earlier, after advancing 2.2% in November and
3.0% in December. The upward trend continued with the
index posting its 10th consecutive year-over-year
increase.  In the past 12 months, upward pressure on the IPPI came
mainly from higher prices for petroleum and coal products
(+11.0%), primary metal products (+11.1%) and, to a lesser
extent, fruits, vegetables, feeds and other food products
(+3.6%), chemical products (+2.3%), meat, fish and dairy
products (+2.2%) as well as pulp and paper products
(+2.0%).  In January, the 4.9% year-over-year increase in the
value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar
dampened the IPPI advance. Without the impact of the
exchange rate, the IPPI would have risen 3.8% instead of
2.7%.  Prices for motor vehicles and other transportation
equipment, which are particularly sensitive to the
exchange rate, fell 2.7% in January compared with the same
month a year earlier, continuing the downward movement
that started in October 2009.  Year over year, if petroleum and coal prices were
excluded, the IPPI would have increased 1.7% in January, a
growth rate comparable with those observed in the previous
three months. It was the ninth consecutive year-over-year
gain.  Raw Materials Price Index: Slight increase in January  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) edged up 0.3% in
January, primarily because of higher prices for non-
ferrous metals (+3.7%), vegetable products (+4.6%) and
animals and animal products (+2.5%).  Copper and nickel concentrates (+5.0%), non-ferrous
metal scrap (+5.2%) and radioactive products (+3.9%) were
the biggest contributors to the advance in the non-ferrous
metals price index. Conversely, precious metals prices 
(-3.6%) was the only group that declined.  Among agricultural products, the biggest contributors
were grains (+5.7%), natural rubber and allied gums
(+14.5%) as well as animals for slaughter such as cattle
and calves (+3.5%) and hogs-swine (+6.0%).  On the other hand, mineral fuels prices fell 2.6% in
January. Crude oil declined 2.5% in January following a
6.0% increase in December. In  North America , crude oil
supplies grew and inventories were up.  Without mineral fuels, the RMPI would have increased
for the seventh consecutive month, rising 2.8% in January,
which is comparable to the 3.1% gain in December.  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the RMPI
was up 9.6% in January, following a 13.2% increase in
December. Year over year, the RMPI has been on an upward
trend since November 2009. Higher prices for non-ferrous
metals (+18.7%), vegetable products (+35.8%), mineral
fuels (+4.4%) as well as animals and animal products
(+6.3%) were the main factors in the RMPI year-over-year
advance in January.  Year over year, if mineral fuels were excluded, the
RMPI would have increased 14.4% in January, its largest
growth rate since June 2007 when it rose 17.6%.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
are subject to revision for six months (for example, when
the July index is released, the index for the preceding
January becomes final).  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in  Canada  receive as the goods leave
the plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer
pays. Unlike the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes
indirect taxes and all the costs that occur between the
time a good leaves the plant and the time the final user
takes possession of it, including the transportation,
wholesale, and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often
indicate their prices in foreign currencies, especially in
US dollars, which are then converted into Canadian
dollars. In particular, this is the case for motor
vehicles, pulp, paper and wood products. Therefore, a rise
or fall in the value of the Canadian dollar against its US
counterpart affects the IPPI. But the conversion into
Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents provide
their prices. Moreover, this is not a measure that takes
into account the full effect of exchange rates, since that
is a more difficult analytical task.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is
based on the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot
rate) established by the  Bank of Canada , and it is
available on CANSIM in table 176-0064 (series v37426).
Monthly and annual variations in the exchange rate, as
described in the text, are calculated according to the
indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for example,
CAN$1=US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the
prices paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw
materials. Many of those prices are set on the world
market. However, as few prices are denominated in foreign
currencies, their conversion into Canadian dollars has
only a minor effect on the calculation of the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
