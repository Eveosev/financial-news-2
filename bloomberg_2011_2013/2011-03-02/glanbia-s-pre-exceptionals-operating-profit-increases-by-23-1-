  Glanbia Plc , an Irish food company,
said today profit from operations rose 23 percent, excluding
exceptional items, as sales rose amid a recovery in dairy
markets last year.  Operating profit, before exceptional items, rose to 136.5
million euros ($188 million) for the year ended Jan. 1 from
111.2 million euros a year earlier, Glabia said in a statement.
Sales at the Kilkenny-based company rose 18 percent to 2.17
billion euros.  “Global dairy markets are strong and that gives a positive
background as we head into this year,” said Glanbia group
managing director John Moloney in a telephone interview. “We
are optimistic for good top-line growth in our nutritional
business in particular.”  Glanbia, which bought Florida-based Bio-Engineered
Supplements and Nutrition for $144 million in January,
reiterated its forecast for adjusted earnings per share growth
of 11 percent to 13 percent for this year. Global dairy markets
are expected to remain “robust” this year, underpinned by
demand from emerging markets, including  China , Glanbia said.  Net income declined to 108 million euros from 112.7 million
euros a year earlier, after a one-time gain of 100 million euro
from a revision to the company’s pension plans in 2009, fell out
of earnings this year.  Further restructuring of Glanbia’s pension arrangements
resulted in a one-time credit of 10.2 million euros, before tax,
last year, according to the company’s financial statements.  Glanbia rose 1.1 percent to 4.35 euros as much as 8:17 a.m.
in Dublin, giving the company a market value of 1.28 billion
euros.    Kerry Group Plc , Ireland’s largest food company, said
earnings may rise by as much as 12 percent this year, as it
considers more acquisitions. Kerry said Feb. 22 it expects
adjusted earnings per share of 210 euro cents to 218 cents,
compared with 194.5 cents in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
