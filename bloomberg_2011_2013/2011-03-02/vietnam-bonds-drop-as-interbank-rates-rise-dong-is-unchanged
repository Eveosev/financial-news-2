  Vietnam ’s government bonds dropped
as interbank rates rose, signaling banks have fewer funds to
invest in debt.  Central bank Governor Nguyen Van Giau said yesterday cash
from the financial system was drained via open-market operations.
Banks have also been told to slow lending to below 20 percent,
compared with 23 percent last year.  “Banks have less funds to buy bonds these days,” said
Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, the Ho Chi Minh City-based head of fixed-
income trading at Asia Commercial Bank. The increase in
interbank rates makes it more expensive for lenders to buy debt
with borrowed funds, she said.  The yield on three-year bonds climbed for a second day,
adding seven basis points to 11.28 percent as of 3:43 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The overnight interbank deposit rate rose 14 basis
points to 11.36 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung last week ordered the
central bank to take a “tight” policy in a bid to curb
inflation, which accelerated to a two-year high of 12.31 percent
last month. Vietnam will prioritize cooling inflation over
economic growth, state newspaper Nong Thon Ngay Nay reported
today, cited Finance Minister Vu Van Ninh.  The dong traded at 20,873 per dollar, unchanged from
yesterday, according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,663,
compared with 20,668 yesterday, its website showed. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of that rate.  In the so-called black market, the dong traded between
21,540 and 21,640 at gold shops in  Ho Chi Minh City , compared
with 21,580 to 21,730 yesterday, according to a telephone
information service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts &
Telecommunications.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editor: Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
