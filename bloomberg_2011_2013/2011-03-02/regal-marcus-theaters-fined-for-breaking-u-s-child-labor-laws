Regal Entertainment Group , the
largest U.S. theater chain, was ordered by the U.S. Department
of Labor to pay $158,400 in civil penalties for hiring minors
for potentially hazardous work.  Marcus Theatre Corp., based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was
fined $93,995, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Wehrenberg Inc.
$25,080 for allowing minors to perform possibly dangerous tasks.
Marcus also was cited for allowing youths to work more hours
than permitted, the department said in a statement posted on its
website.  The cinema industry tends to have a high rate of non-
compliance with child labor laws, the Labor Department said in
the statement. The violations involved 160 minors working in 27
theaters owned by the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
