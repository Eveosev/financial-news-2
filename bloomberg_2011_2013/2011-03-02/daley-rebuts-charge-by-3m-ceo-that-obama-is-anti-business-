White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley said he was “amazed” that  3M Co . Chief Executive Officer
George Buckley described President Barack Obama as “anti-
business.”  Writing in an op-ed in the Financial Times newspaper, Daley
said that Obama has a “deep, abiding commitment to doing what
is necessary to strengthen our economy and make America more
competitive.”  “There is plenty of work to do,” Daley wrote. “But the
stakes are too high to give credence to the kind of comments Mr.
Buckley made this week, or to believe those who would question
Mr. Obama’s commitment to our economic recovery.”  Buckley said in an interview last week with the Financial
Times that if the U.S. business environment is perceived as
“hostile,” manufacturers may leave to set up operations in
Mexico or Canada. He characterized Obama’s instincts as “Robin
Hood-esque” and said: “He is anti-business.”  Obama has made efforts to correct that perception among
some business leaders. In addition to naming Daley, a former
executive at  JPMorgan Chase & Co ., as his chief of staff, he
recently appointed an advisory council on jobs and
competitiveness headed by  General Electric Co . CEO  Jeffrey Immelt . Last month, he addressed the nation’s largest business
group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
