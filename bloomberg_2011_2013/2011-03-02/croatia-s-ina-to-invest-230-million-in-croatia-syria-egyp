  INA Industrija Nafte DD , a Croatian
refiner controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt, will invest $230
million this year to explore, produce and develop oil sources in
Croatia, its Adriatic Sea coast, Syria, Egypt and Angola.    INA  will inject $105.2 million of the total investment into
development of new wells and production in Croatia, the Zagreb-
based company said in a statement on its website.  The plant in Hayan, Syria, will receive $69.5 million to
increase production of gas and liquid petroleum gas, expected to
reach its production peak of 24,500 barrels a day in 2012 to
2013. INA will also invest $15.5 million in exploration in its
other Syrian plant, Aphamia, and a combined $30 million in
exploration and development in Egypt and  Angola , it said.  INA in 2010 had its first full-year profit since 2007 as
increased production in Syria and the northern Adriatic boosted
revenue. The company will continue with modernization of its two
refineries in Croatia and with the plans to refresh its retail
network, it said.  Mol holds a 47.26 percent stake in INA, while the Croatian
government owns 44.84 percent of the country’s largest refiner.  In addition to 11 exploration and production plants in
Croatia and 19 off-shore platforms in the northern Adriatic
jointly owned with  Italy ’s ENI SpA and Edison SpA, INA has
upstream facilities in Syria, Egypt and Angola.  INA is the biggest investor and the fourth-biggest employer
in  Croatia , having invested about 17 billion kuna ($3.16
billion) in the last decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
