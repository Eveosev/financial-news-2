  China Forestry Holdings Ltd . said
Li Han Chun, its former chief executive officer, was detained
by police in China for the alleged embezzlement of 30 million
yuan ($4.6 million).  Li, replaced by Li Jian as CEO on Feb. 18, removed
company files including sales documents of unit Kunming Ultra
Big Forestry Resources Development Co., according to a China
Forestry statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. Li
Han Chun was detained by police in China’s Guizhou province
on Feb. 24, it said.  Hong Kong Court of First Instance Judge Carlye Chu on
Feb. 11 extended an order to freeze HK$398.2 million ($51.12
million) of assets held by the former CEO, who sold shares
before the company disclosed accounting irregularities.
Moody’s Investors Service put  China  Forestry’s debt on review
for a downgrade on the share suspension in the city Jan. 26.  “The company is in the process of ascertaining the
extent of documents taken away by Mr. Li Han Chun and is
seeking legal advice as to recovery of such documents,”
China Forestry said in the statement today.  The company is checking its current liabilities position,
according to the statement.  The shares will remain suspended until further notice,
the company said.  China Forestry Holdings Co. will be removed from the
Hang Seng Composite Index from March 7 because of the
company’s prolonged suspension, Hang Seng Indexes Co. said in
a Feb. 28 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
