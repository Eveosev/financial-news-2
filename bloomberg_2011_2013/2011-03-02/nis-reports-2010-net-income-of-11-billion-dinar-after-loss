Naftna Industrija Srbije AD, the
Serbian refiner majority owned by OAO Gazprom Neft, said it
posted a profit last year on increased production and improved
efficiency.  Net income before extraordinary items was 16.5 billion
dinars ($219 million), compared with a loss of 37.7 billion
dinars in 2009, after it pumped more from its oil and gas fields
in  Serbia , the Nis, Serbia-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Net income after extraordinary items was 11 billion dinars,
while operating revenue was almost unchanged at almost 118
billion dinars. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
more than tripled to 32.4 billion dinars, while income from fuel
trade increased 2 percent in the year,  The weakness of the dinar, blamed for the loss in 2009,
continued to hurt the companyâ€™s financial performance as it
increased its foreign-currency costs in 2010, according to the
statement. NIS imports most of its supplies. It reduced its debt
in 2010 by $382 million to $611 million, the company also said.  Gazprom Neft bought 51 percent of NIS for 400 million euros
($553 million) in early 2009 with a commitment to invest another
500 million euros. In January, it offered to buy another 19.12
percent of the company from small shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
