  South Africa ’s 30-year bonds, the
longest-dated debt it has offered on international markets,
gained in the first day of trading.  The 6.25 percent debt due March 2041 was bid at 99.85 cents
on the dollar at UBS AG and 99.75 cents at ING Groep NV at 11:11
a.m. in Johannesburg, compared with a listing price of 99.44,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bond was priced
with a spread 180 basis points above the  U.S. Treasury ’s 30-year
benchmark bonds, the National Treasury said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “With current levels of uncertainty in the financial
markets because of recent developments in the Middle East, the
response to this bond has been exceedingly good, with bids
received being more than four times the value of the deal,” the
Pretoria-based National Treasury said. “ The bond represents
pre-funding for the fiscal year beginning on April 1.”  The National Treasury on Feb. 23 said it will sell about $1
billion of foreign bonds each year for the next three. It also
raised its forecast for domestic loans for 2011-12 to help fund
a higher-than-expected budget deficit of 5.3 percent for the
year through March 2012, compared with an estimate in October of
4.6 percent.  South  Africa  joins other emerging markets such as Ukraine,
Mexico and Nigeria in selling bonds in dollars this year. The
nation last sold an international bond in March 2010, when it
raised $2 billion of debt due in March 2020. The bond yielded
4.79 percent today.  “Like last year’s bond issuance, this deal was not
preceded by an extensive road show, but by a teleconference with
investors,” the National Treasury said.  Rand Strength  South Africa in October scrapped plans to issue further
foreign-currency bonds in the year through March 2011 as part of
attempts to weaken the rand, which strengthened 11 percent
against the dollar last year. That made it the best performer
among more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg after  Malaysia ’s ringgit.  Debt of Africa’s biggest economy is rated BBB+ by  Standard
& Poor’s , the third-lowest investment grade and the same level
as Thailand’s.  Thailand ’s only dollar-denominated international
bond, which matures in August 2013, yielded 2.21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
