Put volume for an exchange-traded
fund tracking the Standard & Poor’s MidCap 400 Index jumped to
its highest level since September 2008 after one trade with a
strike price 4.3 percent below today’s close.  A block of 13,900 March $166 puts to sell the MidCap SPDR
Trust traded for $1.13 each at 1:31 p.m. in  New York , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The open interest for the
contract was 562 before today.  More than 22,400 puts to sell the stock changed hands
today, 7.7 times the four-week average and 23 times the number
of calls to buy. The March $166 puts, which were the most-traded
contracts, accounted for more than half of all put volume and
gained 13 percent to $1.13.  The ETF advanced 0.5 percent to $173.46 today. The fund has
gained 37 percent since the S&P MidCap 400’s July 6 low. The
midcap gauge reached a record on Feb. 18, while the S&P SmallCap
600 and large-company-focused S&P 500 are still below their 2007
highs. Irvine, California-based  Edwards Lifesciences Corp ., the
largest maker of artificial  heart valves , and drugmaker  Vertex
Pharmaceuticals Inc . of Cambridge,  Massachusetts , are part of
the index, the components of which average a market value of
$3.07 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
