  Sony Corp. (SNE)  named Universal Music
Group Chairman Doug Morris as chief executive officer of its
music division, replacing Rolf Schmidt-Holtz.  Morris, 72, will start at Sony Music Entertainment on July
1, Howard Stringer, chairman and CEO of the Tokyo-based parent,
said today in a statement.  Under Morris, Universal Music led the industry in sales for
14 straight years and started Vevo.com, a website that shows
advertising-supported music videos. Sony is second to  Vivendi
SA (VIV) ’s Universal Music in market share, according to Nielsen
SoundScan. Morris, who planned to retire at year-end, has been
negotiating an early exit from Universal since January.  Sony American depositary receipts fell 9 cents to $36.18 at
12:59 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They
had gained 1.6 percent this year before today. Vivendi fell 35
cents to 20.04 euros in Paris and had gained about 1 percent
this year.  Schmidt-Holtz is leaving effective March 31, the company
said. Stringer will oversee Sony Music in the interim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
