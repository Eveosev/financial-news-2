  Positivo Informatica SA (POSI3) ,  Brazil ’s
biggest computer maker, fell after fourth-quarter earnings
trailed analysts’ estimates.  Positivo slid 3.9 percent to 9.34 reais at the close of Sao
Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. The Bovespa stock
index gained 1.6 percent to 67,281.51.  The company reported earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of 1 million reais ($603,000),
less than the 18.4 million reais predicted by three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Margins declined mainly on lower prices due to the
enhanced competition by international players seeking market
share,” Andre Baggio and Marcelo Santos, analysts at JPMorgan
Chase & Co, said in a note to clients dated today.  Positivo was cut to “neutral” from “outperform” at
Credit Suisse Group AG, analysts Andrew T. Campbell and Marcelo
Goncalves said in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
