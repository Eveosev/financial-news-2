The dollar and yen climbed against
most of their major counterparts as a surge in energy prices
drove Asian shares to the biggest decline in a week, spurring
demand for safe-haven currencies.  The greenback gained to $1.3752 against the euro as of
12:12 p.m. in Tokyo from $1.3777 in  New York  yesterday. The yen
climbed to 112.61 per euro from 112.77.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 1.1 percent, set for
the biggest daily decline since Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
