Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  ordered the government to rein in fertilizer prices, half
a year after President  Dmitry Medvedev  accused domestic
fertilizer producers of “cartel” behavior.  “Despite the efforts that are being made, fertilizer
prices are still growing,” Putin told farmers today at a
conference in Tambov, central  Russia . Putin said he ordered his
deputies Viktor Zubkov and Igor Sechin to “work out the
necessary measures to restrain prices.”  Medvedev in September called for an investigation into
fertilizer prices as the country’s worst drought in at least 50
years drove up food costs. OAO Uralkali and OAO Silvinit,
Russia’s only producers of the crop nutrient potash, agreed in
November on a maximum price cap for farmers.  Uralkali  later
agreed to buy Silvinit, acquiring the first 20 percent Feb. 28.  “If not on paper, then in spoken form, there exists a
cartel and this all must be investigated as part of an antitrust
process and punished,” Medvedev said Sept. 6 in Voronezh,
southwest Russia.  Uralkali and Silvinit, which sell products to Russian
farmers at a discount to global prices, say that domestic
producers of complex fertilizers compete with them on exports
after buying potash from mining companies as a raw material.  OAO Acron, OAO UralChem and OAO EuroChem are the country’s
biggest makers of complex fertilizers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
