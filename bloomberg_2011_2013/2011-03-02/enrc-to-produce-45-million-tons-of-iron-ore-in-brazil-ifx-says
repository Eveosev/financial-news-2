Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.
plans to produce 45 million metric tons of  iron ore  at its
project in  Brazil  after three years, Interfax reported.  ENRC will invest about $3 billion at the site, helping it
become the world’s fifth-largest iron ore producer, founder
Alexander Machkevitch said today, the news service reported.  The company will also boost iron-ore concentrate output at
its Sokolovsko-Sarbaiskoye GOK unit in  Kazakhstan  to 25 million
tons from 18 million tons now using Chinese funding, Machkevitch
said in the nation’s port of Pavlodar, according to Interfax.  State-owned National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna last
month agreed to borrow $1.6 billion to finance projects at
Sokolovsko-Sarbaiskoye GOK and $400 million for Kazchrome from
China Development Bank Corp., Interfax said.  Asel Kurmanalieva, a spokeswoman for ENRC, declined to
comment immediately when contacted by phone in the Kazakh
capital of Astana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
