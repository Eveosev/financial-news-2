  Los Angeles , the second most-
populous U.S. city, will end this year with the lowest revenue
for its main account since 2007, and see “sluggish” economic
growth in the year starting in July, Controller Wendy Greuel
said.  Taxes and fees for the general fund will grow 0.61 percent
to $4.28 billion, Greuel said in a  report  today.  Los Angeles, which forced some workers to take unpaid
furloughs to save money this year, already faces a deficit of
$350 million for the coming year.  Greuel urged Mayor  Antonio Villaraigosa  to “act quickly to
reduce the  budget deficit ” in a letter attached to the report.
Greuel has said she plans to run for mayor when Villaraigosa’s
term expires in 2013.  This year’s property-tax collections will fall 1.67 percent
to $1.4 billion, while fees for licenses, permits and fines will
decline 8.8 percent to $670 million.  A “significant portion” of the city’s reserve fund will
probably be used to balance the current year’s budget, since a
deal to lease city-owned parking garages was no longer being
pursued, the report said.  Los Angeles will need to borrow $450 million in short-term
notes to cover  cash flow , the same amount as this year, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
