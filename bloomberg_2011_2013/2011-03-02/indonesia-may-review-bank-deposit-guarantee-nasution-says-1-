Indonesia may gradually reduce the
maximum deposit guarantee at banks as a global economic recovery
reduces the risk lenders will fail,  Bank Indonesia  Governor
Darmin Nasution said.  Now “is the right time” to review the guarantee amount
because the financial crisis has passed, Nasution told
participants at a banking seminar in Jakarta today.  Indonesia raised the maximum guarantee for deposits at
banks in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy to 2 billion rupiah
($227,000) from 100 million rupiah on Oct. 13, 2008, as
authorities from  Europe  to  Asia  tried to prevent the global
financial crisis causing a run on their banks.  “We need to discuss with all banks, Bank Indonesia,
parliament, and we need input from Lembaga Penjamin Simpanan,”
Finance Minister  Agus Martowardojo  said at the same seminar,
referring to Indonesia’s  deposit insurance agency . He didn’t
specify a timeframe for a possible change.  Lembaga Penjamin Simpanan Chief Executive Firdaus Djaelani,
who also attended the seminar, proposed reducing the guarantee
cap gradually, “for example, up to 500 million rupiah.”  The agency reduced the maximum deposit guarantee to 100
million rupiah from 1 billion rupiah on March 22, 2007.
On Feb. 9 this year, it raised its maximum guaranteed interest
rate on rupiah-denominated deposits to 7.25 percent from 7
percent and kept the maximum guaranteed interest rate on dollar-
denominated deposits at 2.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
