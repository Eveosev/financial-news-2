Czech Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek may consider cutting the excise tax on  diesel fuel  if
one of the government parties drops its demand to keep a lower
value added  tax rate  on some food items,  Pravo  reported, citing
Kalousek.  Public Affairs, one of the three Czech ruling-coalition
parties, wants selected basic food items to remain in the lower
10 percent VAT bracket while the government plans to unify the
VAT at 20 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
