Oil gained for a second day in  New
York , rising from the highest closing price in 29 months, on
concern the unrest that has curbed crude exports from Libya will
spread to the Middle East.  Futures gained as much as 1 percent as Libyan rebels braced
for renewed clashes with forces loyal to leader Muammar Qaddafi.  Saudi Arabia â€™s benchmark stock index plunged the most in two
years yesterday on concern disturbances may extend to the
kingdom, the biggest supplier in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.  Oil for April delivery gained as much as $1.01 to $100.64 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and was at $100.41 at 5:21 p.m. Singapore time. It
earlier fell as much as 0.4 percent to $99.21.  Yesterday, the contract rose 2.7 percent to $99.63, the
highest since close September 2008. Prices are 25 percent higher
compared with a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
