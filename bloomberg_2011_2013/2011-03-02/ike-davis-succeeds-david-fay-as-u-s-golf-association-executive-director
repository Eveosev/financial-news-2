Mike Davis was chosen as executive
director of the  U.S. Golf Association , succeeding David Fay, who
retired in December.  Davis, who had served as the USGA’s director of rules and
competition since 2005, becomes the seventh executive director
in the organization’s 116-year history.  Fay, 60, held the position for 21 years before ending his
32-year tenure with the Far Hills, New Jersey-based USGA, which
oversees the rules of golf in the U.S. and  Mexico  and stages 17
annual national championships, including the  U.S. Open .  Davis, 46, joined the USGA in April 1990 and has held roles
including championship director of the U.S. Open from 1997
through 2004. As a player, Davis was the 1982 Pennsylvania state
junior champion and a member of the Georgia Southern University
golf team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
