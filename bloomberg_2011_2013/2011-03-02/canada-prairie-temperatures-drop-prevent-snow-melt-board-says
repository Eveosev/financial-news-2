  Canada ’s prairies had temperatures
that were as much as 11 degrees Celsius below normal last week,
and cold weather kept most snow from melting, the Canadian Wheat
Board said in a  statement  on its website.  Daily highs reached minus 4 degrees Celsius (25 degrees
Fahrenheit), and overnight lows dropped to minus 37, according
to the report. Snowfall was limited to “light dustings,” the
Wheat Board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
