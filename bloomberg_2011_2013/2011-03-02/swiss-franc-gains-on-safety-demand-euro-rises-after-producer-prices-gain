The Swiss franc strengthened against
the dollar as  oil prices  rose above $100 a barrel for a second
day amid unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, fueling
demand for the currency as a haven.  The euro rose versus the dollar and yen after a report
showed European producer-price inflation accelerated more than
economists estimated in January. The franc also advanced against
the yen and the Australian dollar. Libyan rebels braced for
renewed clashes with forces loyal to leader Muammar Qaddafi and
Al Arabiya television reported Iranian protesters fought with
security forces. New Zealand’s dollar fell to the lowest level
this year after Prime Minister John Key said he expected a cut
in the nation’s benchmark rate.  “The Swiss franc has been supported by demand for
safety,” said  Derek Halpenny , European head of currency
research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd, in London. “If
there was any pronounced escalation in  risk aversion , you’d see
the dollar perform very well.”  The Swiss franc strengthened 0.3 percent to 92.53 centimes
as of 10:54 a.m. in London, and 0.4 percent to 88.52 yen. The
euro climbed 0.4 percent to $1.3827 and 113.27 yen. The dollar
traded at 81.92 yen from 81.86 yen yesterday in  New York .  Factory-gate prices in the euro region jumped 6.1 percent
from a year earlier, after increasing 5.3 percent in December,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the fastest since September 2008 and more than the 5.7
percent gain forecast by economists before the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
