Ukrainian farmers will sow grains on
an additional 528,000 hectares (1.3 million acres) for the 2011
harvest compared with the prior year, Agriculture Minister
Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  That equates to an increase of 3.5 percent from the 15.128
million hectares planted last year, according to the Agriculture
Ministry’s website.  Spring barley planting will rise by 70,000 hectares from a
year ago, Prysyazhnyuk said in a  statement  on the ministry’s
website. That compares with the 2.75 million hectares sown in
2010, according to the national statistics office.  Corn seeding will expand by 71,000 hectares, the minister
said. Farmers planted the grain on 2.48 million hectares last
year, according to the statistics office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
