States of the Gulf Cooperation
Council are working on starting a Marshall-style plan to support
Bahrain and  Oman , which are facing instability,  Al-Qabas 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The six members of the GCC are currently holding diplomatic
talks on the matter, which may lead to a summit, the newspaper
said. The plan aims to raise Omanis’ and Bahrainis’ living
conditions, improve their economic and social conditions, create
job opportunities for the unemployed and provide homes for the
homeless, according to Al-Qabas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
