Angola’s ruling party said European
nations are backing calls by some Angolans for the ouster of
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Radio Nacional de  Angola 
reported, citing a senior party official.  The statement yesterday by Bento Bento, the Luanda
provincial secretary of the Popular Movement for the Liberation
of Angola, came after an anonymous call that has circulated via
the internet,  text messages  and e-mails urging Angolans to
demonstrate on March 7 against dos Santos, who has ruled the
oil-rich African nation since 1979.  To contact the reporter on this story:
