Taiwan’s benchmark 10-year bonds
rose, snapping a four-day decline, as investors sought the
relative safety of debt after rising oil prices spurred concern
the global economic recovery will slow.  The Taiex index of shares retreated from a one-week high
after crude for April delivery rallied past $100 a barrel in  New
York  on speculation political turmoil in the Middle East will
disrupt supplies. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
yesterday a sustained rise in the price of oil would be a
“threat” to growth in the world’s largest economy.  “Political uncertainties in the Middle East continue to
undermine risk-taking sentiment in Taiwan’s markets,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based bond trader at Polaris Securities Co.  The yield on the 1.375 percent bond due March 2021, the
most-traded government debt, closed two basis points lower at
1.42 percent in Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The Taiex dropped 1.2
percent to 8,619.90 as overseas investors cut their holdings of
the island’s equities by NT$11.9 billion ($400 million).    Taiwan ’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.665, from
NT$29.660 yesterday, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
strengthened 0.3 percent yesterday, its biggest advance in a
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
