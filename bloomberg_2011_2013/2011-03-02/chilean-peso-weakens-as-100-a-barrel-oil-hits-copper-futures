Chile’s peso weakened for a third
day as stocks and copper declined worldwide on concern rising  oil prices  will slow the global economic recovery.  The peso declined 0.2 percent to 476.83per  U.S. dollar  from
476.1 yesterday. It earlier fell as much as 0.6 percent to
479.02 per dollar. Inflation expectations reached new two-year
highs as oil prices rose.  Copper for May delivery fell 0.2 percent on the Comex in  New York  as the price of West Texas Crude oil passed $101. The
Chilean peso is the weakest currency in the region in the last
two weeks as turmoil in the Middle East has pushed oil prices
higher, causing Chile’s terms of trade to deteriorate.  “Today it’s copper,” said Osvaldo Cruz, an economist at
Banco de Credito & Inversiones in Santiago. “In the last two
weeks the peso has depreciated against other emerging-market
currencies.  Chile  is an importer of oil and is much more exposed
than others. Mexico and  Brazil  for example have their own oil
production.”  Chile imports more than 99 percent of its oil needs. Oil
and gasoline are its two biggest imports.  West Texas crude for April delivery reached $101.57 as of
11:36 a.m. New York time.  Brent crude  for April delivery rose
1.5 percent to $117.14.  The increase in oil prices has generated concerns of rising
inflation in Chile. Wholesale gasoline prices will climb 2.3
percent tomorrow, the state-owned oil refiner Empresa Nacional
del Petroleo said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The price
of domestic kerosene will increase 4.2 percent, Enap said.  Rate Expectations  The inflation forwards market is expecting a 0.78 percent
increase in the cost of living this month, according to Banco
Santander SA prices, up from the 0.56 percent March inflation
being priced in on Feb. 2. That would be the biggest jump in
prices since September 2009.  The one-year breakeven inflation rate, a measure of the
average annual inflation priced into interest-rate swaps, jumped
13 basis points today to 4.69 percent. That’s the most since
2008. Two-year breakeven inflation climbed eight basis points to
4.42 percent, also a new two-year high.  The central bank today paid 2.92 percent on an auction of
10-year bonds, the lowest since April 2009, as investors seek
protection from rising prices. The bank published the results of
the bond sale on its website.  The yield on a basket of 10-year Chilean central bank bonds
has dropped 26 basis points in the last two weeks. The yield on
a basket of similar bonds with no inflation adjustment fell nine
basis points to 6.78 percent, implying a 15 basis point increase
in the premium investors demand for exposure to price rises.  Foreign investors in the Chilean forwards market increased
their net bet against the peso to $1.2 billion on Feb. 28 from
$1 billion on Feb. 25, according to central bank data.  Chile’s central bank bought $50 million at an average of
477.90 pesos per dollar for $50 million, according to a
statement on its website today.  The bank is buying $50 million of U.S. currency a day for
international reserves as part of a $12 billion plan to weaken
the peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
