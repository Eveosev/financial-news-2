  Mercator Poslovni Sistem  d.d.,
southeast  Europe ’s biggest supermarket chain, said profit last
year surged 44 percent on advancing sales in Croatia and
Montenegro.  Net income in 2010 was 30.4 million euros ($42 million)
from 21.1 million euros a year earlier, the Ljubljana, Slovenia
based company said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.
Revenue gained 5 percent to 2.78 billion euros.  Slovenia’s biggest public company by revenue earns more
than a third of its sales in the states of the former Yugoslavia
as well as Albania and  Bulgaria  where the retailer has expanded.
Mercator may be taken over by its Croatian rival Agrokor d.d.,
the largest privately held company in the neighboring country.
Agrokor, based in Zagreb, is considering a bid as the two rivals
compete for market share in the Balkans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
