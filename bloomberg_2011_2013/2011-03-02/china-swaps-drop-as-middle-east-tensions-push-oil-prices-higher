  China ’s interest-rate swaps fell as
political unrest in the Middle East pushed up  oil prices ,
raising concern global economic growth will slow.  The one-year swap contract tied to the seven-day repurchase
rate dropped one basis point to 3.76 percent as of 11:53 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oil climbed
past $100 a barrel as Libyan rebels braced for renewed clashes
with forces loyal to leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  “Global uncertainties are weighing a bit on rate-hike
expectations throughout  Asia  right now,” said Delphine Arrighi,
a Hong Kong-based strategist at Standard Chartered Plc.  The five-year swap, in which the floating seven-day repo
rate is exchanged for a fixed payment, declined four basis
points to 4.24 percent. The repo rate, a gauge of the
availability of funds, was little changed at 3.01 percent,
according to a daily fixing from the National Interbank Funding
Center published at 11 a.m. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  “Current swap levels appear too low,” according to
Arrighi, who forecasts at least another two interest-rate
increases by June and a further tightening in lenders’ reserve
requirements. “The focus remains heavily on inflation,” she
said.    Tim Condon , head of Asian research at ING Groep NV, said
he’s skeptical about another addition to banks’ reserves in the
immediate future and the central bank will likely wait to see
February’s data on new loans or total credit.  The People’s Bank of China raised its benchmark one-year
lending rate to 6.06 percent from 5.81 percent on Feb. 9, the
third increase in four months. The one-year deposit rate was
lifted to 3 percent from 2.75 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.77 percent bond due
December 2020 was unchanged at 3.95 percent, according to
Chinabond, the nation’s biggest debt-clearing house.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
