Pacific Investment Management Co.
Chief Executive Officer Mohamed El-Erian said his funds won’t
buy bonds from  Greece , Portugal or Ireland until the countries
undertake debt restructuring.  “We would rather stay on the sidelines until these
countries are both willing and able to confront their problems,
and at that stage we will consider buying their bonds,” El-
Erian told  Andrea Catherwood  in Bloomberg Television’s “The
Last Word” program.  El-Erian said he would need to see “an orderly, pre-
emptive and voluntary restructuring of the debt, something that
we’ve seen in other countries like Uruguay.  ‘‘The second condition is a set of structural reforms that
allow these economies to grow over time,’’ he said. ‘‘So we are
waiting, we have a check-list, if you like, and we are waiting
to see policy actions that address both the debt overhang and
the growth deficit. If we see that, then we will get involved
again.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
