Nigeria sold $250 million of foreign
currency at an auction today, less that $342 million demanded by
lenders, the Abuja-based central bank said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Dollars were sold for between 150.60 naira and 150.81 naira
each, the bank said. The marginal rate, which is also used as
the prevailing exchange rate, was 150.71 naira compared with
150.56 naira at the previous auction held on Feb. 28.  It was the third straight auction at which the central bank
was unable to meet demands for foreign exchange made by lenders
on behalf of their customers.  The currency of  Africa â€™s biggest oil producer and most
populous country weakened for the fourth day in five to 153.8
naira per dollar at 6:33 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
