The  New York Jets  released defensive
tackle Kris Jenkins, linebacker Jason Taylor and tackle Damien Woody two days before the start of the  National Football
League â€™s new year, General Manager Mike Tannenbaum said.  Jenkins, 31, has been on injured reserve since he tore the
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee against the  Baltimore Ravens  on Sept. 13. He spent three seasons with the
Jets.  Taylor, 36, a 14-year veteran who ranks first among active
players with 132.5 sacks, appeared in 16 regular season and
three postseason games in his only year with the Jets.  Woody, 33, who played three seasons with the Jets, started
13 regular-season games and one playoff game during 2010 before
being placed on injured reserve with a damaged Achilles tendon
on Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
