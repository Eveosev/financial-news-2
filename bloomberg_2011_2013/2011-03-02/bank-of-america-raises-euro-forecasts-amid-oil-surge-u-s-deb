  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  raised its
first-quarter and long-term forecasts for the euro versus the
dollar, saying the revisions reflect gains in the shared
currency and concern the U.S. will have difficulty dealing with
its  budget deficit .  Strategists led by David Woo in New York increased the
first-quarter projection to $1.30 per euro from $1.23 to reflect
an increase in European short-term interest rates and the surge
in oil prices, according to a report to clients. The forecast is
now $1.35 for year-end 2011, from $1.30, and $1.40 for December
2012, from $1.35. The second-quarter estimate was unchanged at
$1.20 to reflect a focus on the European sovereign debt crisis,
the strategists wrote.  “In the long term, we are quite concerned about a fiscal
crisis in the U.S. which will set the dollar weaker,” Paresh Upadhyaya, the firm’s head of Americas G-10 currency strategy in  New York , said in a telephone interview.  The euro gained 0.7 percent to $1.3868 today, from $1.3777
yesterday. It touched $1.3891, the highest level since Nov. 9.  The shared currency has risen 3.6 percent this year as
traders raised bets the  European Central Bank  will raise
interest rates. The extra yield investors receive from buying
one-year European debt over 12-month  U.S. Treasuries  rose to 92
basis points today, or 0.92 percentage point. It touched 95
basis points Feb. 24, the highest since January 2009.  ECB policy makers, who meet tomorrow, have held their key
interest rate at 1 percent since May 2009. The  Federal Reserve ,
which meets March 15, has kept its benchmark at zero to 0.25
percent since December 2008.  Bank of America now looks for the Fed to refrain from
raising interest rates until the third quarter of 2012, the
strategists wrote.  Turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East has fueled a 13
percent surge in crude  oil prices  since the start of February on
concern supplies will be disrupted, weighing on the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
