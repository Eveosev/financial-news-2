Wind gusts ahead of a cold front are
delaying flights into New York-area airports by more than an
hour, according to the  Federal Aviation Administration .  The front just west of New York has winds gusting to as
much as 45 miles per hour (72 kph), according to  John Murray , a
National Weather Service meteorologist at  Upton, New York . Gusts
will persist through the afternoon, he said.  “It’s mostly the wind that is the effect here,” Murray
said. “During takeoffs and landings, they have to be cognizant
of that.”  LaGuardia Airport in New York reports delays of as much as
one hour and 51 minutes for arriving flights, according to the
FAA. At Newark Liberty International, inbound traffic has been
delayed as much as 75 minutes.  In addition, flights to  San Francisco  are experiencing
delays of more than an hour because of low clouds.  As of 12:30  New York  time, 168 flights were canceled in the
U.S. with the most originating or arriving at La Guardia,
according to  FlightAware , a Houston-based airline tracking
service.  After the front passes, temperatures in New York will drop,
Murray said. Highs will be in the lower 30s tomorrow, he said.
The normal high temperature at this time of year is about 45
degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius).  EXC US <Equity> CN
