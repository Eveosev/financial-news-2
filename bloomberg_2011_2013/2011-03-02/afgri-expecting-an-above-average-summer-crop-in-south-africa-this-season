  Afgri Ltd ., which handles about 31
percent of South Africa’s grain, said this year’s summer harvest
of corn and oilseeds is likely to be “above-average” after
last season’s bumper crop.  “The recent rains and the improvement in international
prices on the back of low international stocks have restored a
level of optimism to the sector,” the Pretoria-based company
said in a statement today. “Excessive rain” in South Africa
has caused “very little damage thus far,” it said.  While farmers took a cautious approach to the current
season after last year’s bumper harvest, the total area planted
is expected to be comparable as farmers substitute corn with
soybeans and sunflowers, Afgri said.    South Africa  may produce the smallest corn crop in four
years this season, the nation’s Crop Estimates Committee said
last week, citing lower prices.  The crop may decline 14 percent to 11.04 million metric
tons, from 12.82 million tons reaped last year, it said. The
sunflower seed harvest may be  65 percent  bigger at 808,420 tons
and farmers may produce 729,050 tons of soybeans, 29 percent
more than last year, it said.  White corn for July delivery, the most-active contact on
the South African Futures Exchange, fell 17 rand, or 1 percent,
to 1,636 rand ($235) a ton today. Meal made from the grain is
South Africa’s staple food. Yellow corn for July delivery
dropped 12 rand, or 0.7 percent, to 1,690 rand a ton. The grain
is used mainly for  animal feed  in South Africa.  Soybeans for May delivery rose 0.5 percent to 3,462 rand a
ton, while sunflower seeds for delivery in the same month
climbed 1.1 percent to 4,240 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
