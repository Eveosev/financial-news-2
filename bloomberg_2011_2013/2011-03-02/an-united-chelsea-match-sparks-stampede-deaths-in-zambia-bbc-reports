Four police officers in Zambia have
been charged with murder after two soccer fans watching
Chelsea’s victory over Manchester United yesterday died during a
stampede, the  British Broadcasting Corp. reported .  A 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man died after police
threw a tear gas canister to clear the bar that was open late
illegally, the  BBC  said, citing local police.  The match between the Premier League champion and the
current leader was one of the most anticipated fixtures of the
year. The English top-tier competition has the largest global
following of all of  Europe ’s domestic leagues.  Chelsea came from behind to win 2-1 at  London ’s Stamford
Bridge. United remain top, 12 points ahead of fourth-place
Chelsea and four ahead of Arsenal in second.  To contact the reporter on this story:
