  Lionel Messi  scored the only goal as
Barcelona beat Valencia to move 10 points clear of archrival
Real Madrid at the top of Spanish soccer’s La Liga.  Messi, the World Player of the Year, sealed the win with 14
minutes left at Valencia’s Mestalla stadium last night. The
Argentine finished with a low left-foot shot from near the
penalty spot for his league-leading 27th goal of the season.  Barcelona’s 23rd win from 26 games lifted the two-time
defending champion to 71 points and sent third-place Valencia to
it first loss in 12 league matches. Real Madrid can cut the gap to
seven points by beating Malaga at home tonight.  Fourth-place Villarreal defeated Hercules 1-0 to move to
within a point of Valencia on 50 points.  Former Real Madrid captain Raul scored the only goal as
Schalke ended Bayern Munich’s German Cup defense with a 1-0 win
in their semifinal. Schalke will face second-tier MSV Duisburg
in the May 21 final in Berlin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
