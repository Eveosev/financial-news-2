Turkish shares weakened for a third
day after  oil prices  climbed to a 30-month high yesterday,
threatening the central bank’s efforts to cut the trade gap.  The benchmark ISE National 100 stock index fell 0.1 percent
to 58,664.24 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul. The gauge has
now lost about 18 percent from its high on Nov. 9.  Oil rose to $100.03 a barrel after earlier trading for as
much as $101.47 after a U.S. government report showed an
unexpected decline in inventories.  Turkey  imports 93 percent of
its oil and surging crude prices driven by unrest in the Middle
East and North Africa threaten to widen the country’s current-
account deficit. The central bank has lowered  interest rates 
twice since December and increased lenders’ reserve requirements
to weaken the currency and prevent a credit bubble.  Stock declines are “the result of both the MENA region-
related worries and the question marks over the effectiveness of
the CBRT’s new policy mix,”  Yarkin Cebeci , an Istanbul-based
economist for JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a telephone
interview. “Higher oil prices, the widening current account
deficit and the expected rise in supply-side inflationary forces
are all unnerving investors.”  Turkey’s current-account deficit was $7.5 billion in
December, the biggest in a central bank data series that goes
back to 1984. The government is aiming for a current-account gap
of $42.2 billion, or 5.4 percent of estimated gross domestic
product, this year.  The  trade gap  was $7.3 billion, almost double the estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of economists, even as the central bank
unexpectedly cut its main rate in January to an all-time low to
deter short-term capital flows and boost competitiveness of
exports.  Yields on benchmark two-year lira bonds fell 10 basis
points to 8.85 percent, according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark
Bond Index. The lira was little changed at 1.6134 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
