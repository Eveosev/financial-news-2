  Daimler AG  Chief Executive Officer
Dieter Zetsche’s compensation more than doubled in 2010 after
surging sales in China helped the world’s second-largest maker
of luxury cars post its biggest annual profit since 2002.  Zetsche earned 8.69 million euros ($12 million), including
fixed salary, a bonus payment and stock options, a jump of 105
percent from 2009, Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler said today
in its  annual report . Growth was driven by Zetsche’s variable
compensation, which surged sevenfold to 4.82 million euros.  The increase makes Daimler’s CEO one of the best-paid
executives among companies on Germany’s benchmark DAX Index.
Peter Loescher, CEO of Europe’s biggest engineering company  Siemens AG , earned almost 9 million euros for the fiscal year
ended Sept. 30, a gain of 26 percent.  Deutsche Bank AG  CEO  Josef Ackermann  was paid 9.55 million euros in 2009.  Daimler proposed resuming dividend payments at 1.85 euros a
share for last year after dropping investor compensation for
2009 during the global recession. Growing wealth in China and
recovering spending in the U.S. have since boosted demand for
luxury cars. Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz division as well as its
peers  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and  Volkswagen AG ’s Audi brand
are aiming for record sales this year.  Contract Extension  Zetsche’s contract expires at the end of 2013 after the
carmaker extended it by three years in February 2010. Daimler
returned to profit last year, posting earnings before interest
and taxes of 7.27 billion euros compared with a loss of
1.51 billion euros for 2009. The carmaker forecast on Feb. 16
that operating profit will rise “significantly” this year.  Sales in 2010 rose 24 percent to 97.8 billion euros as both
revenue and deliveries more than doubled in China. Daimler is
building a motor factory in the country, its first plant for  car
engines  outside Germany.  Daimler fell as much as 4.2 percent to 48.86 euros and was
down 2.8 percent as of 12:22 in Frankfurt trading, the second-
biggest drop on Germany’s benchmark  DAX Index , as stocks
declined worldwide for a second day following an increase in oil
prices. Daimler shares have fallen 2.2 percent this year.  Pay for the entire management board, which includes Chief
Financial Officer Bodo Uebber and Andreas Renschler, the head of
Daimler’s truck unit, increased to 25 million euros from 10
million euros. Wolfgang Bernhard, who joined the board as
Mercedes-Benz’s production chief a year ago, earned a total 2.83
million euros last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
