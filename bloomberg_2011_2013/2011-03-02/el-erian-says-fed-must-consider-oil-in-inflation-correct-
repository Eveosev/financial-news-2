Chief Executive Officer Mohamed El-Erian said the  Federal
Reserve  may have to accommodate rising oil prices as he tackles
inflationary pressures.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke “has the power to make sure
that inflation stays contained,” El-Erian told Andrea Catherwood on Bloomberg Television’s “The Last Word.”  “But he can only do that if he compensates for higher oil
prices by lowering prices elsewhere,” El-Erian said. “The
health of the  U.S. economy  can’t take the deflation shock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
