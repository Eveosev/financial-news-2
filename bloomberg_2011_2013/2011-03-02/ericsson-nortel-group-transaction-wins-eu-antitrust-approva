Ericsson AB won European Union
approval for its plans to acquire assets of Nortel Networks
Corp.’s Multi Service Switch business.  The European Commission said the transaction wouldn’t harm
competition after Ericsson agreed to extend a supply contract
between Nortel and Alcatel-Lucent SA for mobile  network
equipment .  The commission found that Ericsson “would not have the
ability to cut off supplies of one of its competitors,” the
regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
