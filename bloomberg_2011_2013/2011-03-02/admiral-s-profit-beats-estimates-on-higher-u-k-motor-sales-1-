  Admiral Group Plc , the U.K. car
insurer that owns the confused.com website, said full-year
profit rose 23 percent on higher revenue from British drivers.  Net income climbed to 193.8 million pounds ($315 million)
from 156.9 million pounds a year earlier, the Cardiff, Wales-
based firm said in a statement today. That beat the 189 million-
pound median estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The big success was the U.K. motor insurance business,”
Chief Executive Officer Henry Engelhardt said in the statement.
“Throughout 2010 we experienced a flood of new business.”  Admiral, which has lower costs than rivals such as Aviva
Plc and  RSA Insurance Group Plc , is seeking to win additional
customers by selling cheaper policies to motorists, its main
market. Car insurance premiums in the U.K. have risen by a third
in the past year as personal injury claims rose, according to
the Automobile Association Ltd.  Admiral, whose largest shareholder is Engelhardt with a 15
percent stake, raised its full-year dividend 18 percent to a
record 68.1 pence a share. That will net Engelhardt about 27.6
million pounds.  Net revenue climbed 26 percent to 640.8 million pounds in
2010 as customer numbers increased 32 percent to 2.75 million,
Admiral said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
