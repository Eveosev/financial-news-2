U.S. stocks erased gains as oil
resumed its advance, rallying above $102 a barrel and tempering
optimism in the economy triggered by a bigger-than-forecast gain
in payrolls.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
after climbing 0.6 percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  slipped 10.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,047.2. Crude
for April delivery surged 2.5 percent to $102.05.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
