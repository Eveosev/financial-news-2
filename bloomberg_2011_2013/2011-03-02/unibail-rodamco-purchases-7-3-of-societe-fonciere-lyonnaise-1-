Unibail-Rodamco SE (UL) , Europe’s largest
publicly traded property company, said it purchased a stake in
French real estate investor  Societe Fonciere Lyonnaise (FLY)  for 106.5
million euros ($147.7 million).  Unibail-Rodamco, which owns malls across Europe and
develops offices mostly in Paris, bought Eurohypo AG’s 7.3
percent  stake  in SFL at 31.59 euros a share, according to a
statement released after the close of regular trading. The
purchase is almost 11 percent less than SFL’s 35.40-euro  closing
share price  today.  “The acquisition has been made for investment purposes,”
the Paris-based Unibail-Rodamco said in the statement.  SFL has been run since last year by Bertrand Julien- Laferriere, Unibail-Rodamco’s former chief development officer.
SFL owns 3.3 billion euros of real estate, most of which are
office buildings in Paris’s central business district. The
company is controlled by Spain’s  Inmobiliaria Colonial SA. (COL)   Unibail-Rodamco declined 30 cents to 145.30 euros in Paris
trading, valuing the company at 13.3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
