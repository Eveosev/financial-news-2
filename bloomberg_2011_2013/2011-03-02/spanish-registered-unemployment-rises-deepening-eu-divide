  Spain ’s registered unemployment
advanced for a second month in February, deepening the divide
between peripheral economies struggling to recover from the
financial crisis and Germany’s booming labor market.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits in
Spain rose by 68,260, or 1.6 percent, from January to 4.3
million, the Labor  Ministry  in Madrid said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Spain’s  unemployment rate  remains at more than 20 percent,
while the number of Germans out of work dropped to the least
since 1992 last month. Spain’s economy emerged from an almost
two-year recession in 2010 before contracting again in the third
quarter as austerity measures undermined the recovery.  “Unemployment will remain fairly stubbornly high,”  Giada Giani , an economist at Citigroup Inc., said before the data were
released. “It probably isn’t too far away from the peak, but
it’s unlikely to come down any time soon.”  The highest unemployment rate in Europe and the deepest
budget cuts in at least three decades have eroded support for
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who faces regional
and local elections in May. The opposition People’s Party would
win 44.1 percent of the vote if a general election were held
now, compared with 34 percent for the ruling Socialists, a poll
by the state-run Center for Sociological Research showed on Feb.
