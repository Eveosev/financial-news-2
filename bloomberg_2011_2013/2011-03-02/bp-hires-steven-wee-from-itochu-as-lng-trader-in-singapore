  BP Plc  hired Steven Wee from  Itochu
Corp . as a liquefied natural gas trader in Singapore, according
to two people with knowledge of the move.  Wee will work in the company’s LNG trading business, the
people said, requesting not to be named as they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media. David Nicholas, a London-based
BP spokesman, declined to comment in an e-mail yesterday and
Yasuhiro Terashita, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Itochu, didn’t
reply to a telephone call.  Traders led by BP, BG Group Plc, Morgan Stanley and
Citigroup Inc. are setting up or expanding LNG trading desks in
Asia to capture increasing trade in the cleaner-burning fuel
from  China  and India, as well as Japan and  South Korea , the
world’s biggest importers.  BP, Europe’s second-biggest oil company, has stakes in gas
ventures in Trinidad & Tobago, the Bontang and Tangguh projects
in Indonesia, the North West Shelf in Australia and in Egypt and
Abu Dhabi, as well as having equity in seven LNG vessels,
according to its  website.  It also has a stake in an import
facility in China’s southern Guangdong province.  Spot and short-term imports, which include contracts of as
long as four years, were equivalent to about 30 million metric
tons, or about 17 percent of global LNG trade in 2009, according
to data based on BP’s annual energy review and a report by the
International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
