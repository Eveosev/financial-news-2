U.K. special forces are operating in
the Libyan desert regions and are preparing to seize as much as
10 tons of chemical weapons, including mustard gas, at three
locations, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, citing unidentified
U.S. officials.  Troopers from the Special Air Service and Special Boat

called upon to secure the weapons, which also include the nerve
gas sarin, the newspaper said.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
