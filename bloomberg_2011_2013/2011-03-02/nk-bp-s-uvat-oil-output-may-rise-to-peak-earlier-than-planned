TNK-BP,  BP Plc ’s Russian oil venture
with a group of billionaires, may boost production at its Uvat
project in western Siberia to peak levels earlier than planned.  The Uvat project will rise to an output plateau of 10
million metric tons of oil a year (200,800 barrels a day) as
early as 2015, TNK-BP Vice President Viktor Blagoveshchensky
said in comments reported by Interfax and confirmed by spokesman
Dmitry Sergeev. The venture had previously planned to reach peak
output in 2017, the news service said.  Output will remain at that level for three to four years,
which may be extended through further exploration,
Blagoveshchensky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
