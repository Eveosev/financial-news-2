The European Free Trade
Association’s Surveillance Authority has extended rules to allow
governments to support their financial industries.  The ESA said it tightened conditions for granting state
guarantees and added a “new requirement of a viability plan,”
according to a statement on its  website  today.  “In addition, recapitalization and impaired assets
measures will now be matched for all banks with an obligation to
present a restructuring plan,” it said.  ESA monitors the compliance of European Economic Area rules
in Iceland, Norway and  Liechtenstein .  To contact the reporter on this story:
