A Rwandan court denied bail to 29
people accused of being behind a series of grenade attacks in
the capital, Kigali, over the past 13 months that killed at
least seven people.  Judge Harrison Mutabazi said there was a risk the accused
would escape the country. The attacks took place in February,
March, August and January.  The army said on Aug. 24 that the grenade attacks were
linked to ex-army chief of staff Faustine Kayumba Nyamwasa, and
former spy Chief Patrick Karegeye, who fell out with President  Paul Kagame  and now live in exile.  “We have not yet established a link between the attacks
and the exiled former generals,” said Alan Mukuralinda, a
spokesman for the National Public Prosecution Authority, in an
interview from Kigali yesterday. “This is why we asked the
court to detain them for at least one month as we investigate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
