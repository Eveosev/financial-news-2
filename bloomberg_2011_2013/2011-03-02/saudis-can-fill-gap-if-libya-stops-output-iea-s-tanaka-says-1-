  Saudi Arabia  can provide enough oil
to cover any decline in production from Libya, said  Nobuo Tanaka , executive director of the  International Energy Agency .  “Even if Libya stops production entirely, which we
estimate at 1 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, Saudi Arabia
can fill the gap,” he said today in Warsaw.  About 850,000 to 1 million barrels a day of Libyan oil
production is halted, the IEA said earlier today. Production was
curtailed by violence and anti-government protests against long-
time ruler Muammar Qaddafi. Libya produced an average of 1.55
barrels a day in 2010, according to Bloomberg estimates.  Oil market fundamentals are different now from 2008, when
crude climbed above $145 a barrel, Tanaka said. Oil at $100 a
barrel in 2011 would be a burden on the global economic
recovery, he said.  “We’re concerned about the Middle East and  Africa  but
we’ve been sending a message to the markets not to panic,”
Tanaka said.  Saudi Arabia’s spare capacity amounts to 5 million barrels
a day and “huge stocks” of oil should ease concerns about
supply, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
