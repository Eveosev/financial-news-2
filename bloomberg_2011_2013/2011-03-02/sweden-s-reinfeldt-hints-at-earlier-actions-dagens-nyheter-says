Sweden’s government may push forward
initiatives originally planned for 2011 through 2014 because of
strong economic recovery, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter
reported today, citing an interview with Prime Minister Fredrik
Reinfeldt by newswire Tidningarnas Telegrambyraa.  The government, which pushed through 70 billion kronor
($11.1 billion) in income-tax cuts between 2007 and 2010, last
year said it wants to cut taxes on incomes and pensions by
another 25 billion kronor through 2014.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
