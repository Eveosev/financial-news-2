  Multiplus SA (MPLU3) , the frequent-flyer
unit of Brazilian airline Tam SA, gained the most in six weeks
on a plan to pay shareholders the equivalent of a dividend.  Multiplus advanced 5 percent to 29.40 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the most since
Jan. 18. The Bovespa stock index rose 1.6 percent to 67,281.51.  Investors will receive 3.72 reais for each share they own,
the Sao Paulo-based company said in a regulatory filing today.
Shareholders will vote on the matter at a March 17 meeting,
Multiplus said.  “We see this as a positive outcome for cash deployment,”
Sara Delfim and Renato Mimica, analysts at Bank of America
Corp., said in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
