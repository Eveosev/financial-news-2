Grand Slam tennis champion  Serena
Williams  was treated for a blood clot in her lung, People
magazine said, citing the player’s representative Nicole Chabot.  Williams, a former No. 1-ranked player on the WTA women’s
tennis tour and now No. 11, was treated for the clot found last
week, the magazine quoted Chabot as saying. It also quoted the
representative as saying Williams, the winner of 13 Grand Slam
singles titles, received care two days ago in  Los Angeles  for a
bruise that was the result of “treatment for a more critical
situation.”  Williams, 29, hasn’t played a competitive match since
winning Wimbledon in July, cutting her foot in an accident in a
restaurant.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
