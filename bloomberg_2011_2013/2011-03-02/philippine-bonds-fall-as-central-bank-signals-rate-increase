Philippine  government bonds  fell
after the central bank signaled it may start raising borrowing
costs as oil and food prices climb. The peso declined.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has less scope to maintain its
benchmark overnight borrowing rate at a record-low 4 percent,
Governor Amando Tetangco said in an interview yesterday. The
monetary authority’s inflation estimate has “somewhat risen”
from the Feb. 10 forecast of 4.4 percent for 2011 and 3.5
percent for next year, and the numbers will be reviewed this
month, he said.  “There is a strong possibility that the central bank will
take pre-emptive action as early as March as the price of oil
stays around $100 per barrel,” said Marcelo Ayes, a Manila-
based senior vice president at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp.
“Oil tends to drive the cost of transportation and food.”  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 climbed
eight basis points to 5.30 percent as of 4:14 p.m. in  Manila ,
according to Tradition Financial Services. It was the first time
yields had risen since Feb. 24.  “The scope for leaving policy rates unchanged has clearly
narrowed,” Tetangco said. “The inflation path now is moving
closely to the upper end of the target range. This underscores
the need for Bangko Sentral to closely monitor possible second-
round effects.”  The central bank’s remaining policy meetings in the first
half of 2011 are scheduled for March 24, May 5 and June 16.  The  Philippines  has room to keep its benchmark rate
unchanged, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima, a member of the
central bank’s Monetary Board, said today in Manila.  Accelerating Inflation  Crude oil touched $103.41 a barrel in  New York  on Feb. 24,
the highest level since September 2008. It traded as high as
$100.64 today.  Consumer prices rose 3.7 percent this month, according to
the median estimate of 10 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before a government report due March 4. Inflation accelerated to
3.5 percent in January, the fastest pace in four months.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 43.51 per dollar, halting a
three-day rally, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The local
currency will probably trade in a “narrower range,” staying
between 42 and 45, Tetangco said yesterday.  To contact the reporter for this story:
