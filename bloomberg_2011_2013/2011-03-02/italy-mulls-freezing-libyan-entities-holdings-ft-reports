The Italian foreign ministry said it
is “very open in principle” to the idea of freezing Libyan
entities’ shareholdings in Italian companies “as part of agreed
sanctions,” the Financial Times reported.  Italy hasn’t frozen assets belonging to Libyan government-
controlled entities because the European Union didn’t include
them in its sanctions on Qaddafi family assets, the FT said.
Three Libyan government-owned entities own assets worth about 4
billion euros ($6.5 billion) in  Italy , including 7.4 percent of  Unicredit SpA , the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
