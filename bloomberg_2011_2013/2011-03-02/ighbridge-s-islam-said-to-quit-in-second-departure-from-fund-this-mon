Highbridge Capital Management LLC’s
Munib Islam left the $27 billion hedge fund, the second
portfolio manager to depart this month, according to two people
familiar with the matter.  Islam, who oversaw $100 million in European equities out of  London , left the firm today, said one of the people who asked
not to be identified because the information is private. Alec McAree, the global head of equities, will take over his duties,
said the person.  Islam worked with two analysts who remain at the hedge
fund, the person said. Carl Huttenlocher, the firm’s Asia head,
also resigned this month and may set up his own fund, two people
with knowledge of the matter said yesterday. Highbridge is
liquidating its $1.4 billion Asia Opportunities Fund, which
Huttenlocher managed, the people said.  A spokesman for New York-based Highbridge, which is owned
by  JPMorgan Chase & Co ., declined to comment on Islam’s
departure.  Huttenlocher also managed investments in  Asia  for
Highbridge Multi-Strategy Fund, accounting for about 8 percent
of the fund’s $6.5 billion in assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
