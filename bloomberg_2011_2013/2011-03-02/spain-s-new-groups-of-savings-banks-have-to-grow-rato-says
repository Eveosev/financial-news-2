Many of the groups of lenders
emerging from the restructuring of  Spain ’s savings banks will
have to be bigger than they are now, said Rodrigo Rato, chairman
of Banco Financiero y de Ahorros.  In a year’s time, the size of some lenders will have to be
substantially larger than at present, said Rato, speaking to
reporters at a news conference in Valencia, Spain today.  With assets of 328 billion euros ($453 billion), Banco
Financiero, which resulted from a merger of seven savings banks
led by  Caja Madrid , is the biggest group to emerge from the
consolidation of the industry spurred by tougher rules on
capital set by the government.  Caja Espana-Caja Duero is in talks about merging into Grupo
Mare Nostrum, though no decision has been taken, the savings-
bank group said in a filing to regulators today. The number of
savings banks in Spain has dropped to 17 from 45 as the
restructuring process gathers pace.  To contact the reporters on this story:
