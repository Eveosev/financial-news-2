Mirza Baig, a currency strategist at
Deutsche Bank AG, discusses the impact of higher  oil prices  on
Asian currencies at the Euromoney Asia Forex Forum in Singapore:  “Oil is uncomfortably high but not at a disaster level.
Maybe from $95 to $115 a barrel, we see much more relative
performance. There are some currencies which can do better,
maybe the  Singapore dollar , the Malaysian ringgit and the
Chinese yuan, because of their huge balance of payments
surpluses.  “If we move to where oil prices start to push beyond $120,
several Asian countries’ current-account surpluses will start to
disappear. In that environment, Asian currencies start to
depreciate because the pressure of oil prices is pushing the
balance of payments into deficit.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
