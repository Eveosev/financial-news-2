Bangladesh Bank, the country’s
central bank and financial regulator, removed  Muhammad Yunus 
from the managing directorship of Grameen Bank, the Financial
Times reported, citing Muzammel Haq, Grameen’s recently
appointed chairman.  Yunus, 70, the 2006 Nobel Peace prize winner and a pioneer
of microfinance, was relieved of his responsibilities for non-
compliance with the central bank’s rules, the newspaper said.  Grameen Bank officials said Yunus has received a letter
from the central bank and they’re consulting a lawyer; for now,
he will continue in office, they told the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
