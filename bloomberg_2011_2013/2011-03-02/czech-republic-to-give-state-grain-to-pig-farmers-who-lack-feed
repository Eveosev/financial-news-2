The  Czech Republic  will release as
much as 300,000 metric tons of grain from state reserves for pig
farmers who lack sufficient feed, the Agriculture Ministry said.  “Pig farms are facing long-term problems so we found a
quick solution and will temporarily use grains from state
reserves,” Agricultural Minister Ivan Fuksa said in a statement
posted on the ministry’s website today.  The farmers must repay the loan of grains in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
