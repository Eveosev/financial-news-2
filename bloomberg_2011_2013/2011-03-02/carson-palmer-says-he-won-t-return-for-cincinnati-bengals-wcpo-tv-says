Carson Palmer would rather retire
than return to the  Cincinnati Bengals ,  WCPO-TV said , citing the
quarterback.  “I have $80 million in the bank,” the Cincinnati
television station cited Palmer as saying in a report on its
website. “I don’t have to play football for money. I’ll play
it for the love of the game but that would have to be
elsewhere.”  The Bengals may seek to trade Palmer rather than let him
retire, the report said.  The 31-year-old Palmer has been a Bengal since being
chosen by Cincinnati with the first overall pick in the 2003
National Football League draft. Palmer’s request to be traded
after the Bengals finished 4-12 last season was denied by team
owner  Mike Brown , the  Associated Press  said Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
