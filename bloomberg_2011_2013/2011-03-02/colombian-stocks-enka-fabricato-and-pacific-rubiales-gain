with a loss of 97 billion pesos in 2009, Javier Zuniga, an
analyst at Bogota-based brokerage firm Interbolsa SA, said today
in a telephone interview.    Enka de Colombia SA  (ENKA CB), another textiles producer,
followed suit, with a 2.8 percent gain to 14.5 pesos.    Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp  (PREC CB), the Toronto-based
oil company, increased 1.3 percent to 65,680 pesos, its fourth
consecutive day of gains. Crude oil prices rose above $100 per
barrel in New York today on concern that unrest in Libya could
spread to other oil-producing countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
