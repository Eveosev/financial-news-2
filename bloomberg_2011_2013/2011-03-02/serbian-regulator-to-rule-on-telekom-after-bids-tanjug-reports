  Serbia ’s  Commission for Protection
of Competition  has turned down Telekom Austria Group’s request
to issue an advance opinion on its possible acquisition of
Telekom Srbija AD,  Tanjug  news agency reported, citing sources
in the Commission it did not name.  The Austrian company’s  VIP Mobile  holds a 13 percent mobile
phone market share in Serbia and acquiring a majority stake in
Telekom Srbija AD, which holds nearly 60 percent of the market,
could cause trouble with the competition office, according to
the report. The Commission will follow procedure to advise on
any market concentration only after possible acquisition, the
report said.  The deadline for the 51 stake in the Serbian national phone
company is March 21 and other bidders may include  Deutsche
Telekom AG ,  Telekom Austria AG , America Movil SAB, Weather
Investments SpA and Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
