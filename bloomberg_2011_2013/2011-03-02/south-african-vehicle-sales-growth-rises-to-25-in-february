South African vehicle sales growth
accelerated in February as the economy expanded and
manufacturers and importers introduced special offers to attract
customers, an industry group said.  Vehicle sales increased an annual 25 percent to 49,164 last
month, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of  South Africa  said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales grew 19
percent in January and 30 percent in both November and December.  “The current strength in the market reflects the strong
underlying momentum” in the economy, the association said.
“Attractive special incentive packages offered by a number of
manufacturers and importers during the month of February also
contributed to the rise in sales.”  The  Reserve Bank  has cut its benchmark interest rate to a
30-year low of 5.5 percent to help boost  consumer spending  in  Africa ’s biggest economy. The recovery in vehicle sales, coupled
with a rebound in export demand, has helped spur a rebound in
manufacturing output, which accounts for 15 percent of the
economy.  Passenger car sales gained 31 percent to 34,056 in February
from a year ago, while purchases of light commercial vehicles,
such as pick-up trucks and minivans, gained 11 percent to
12,854, the association said.  Export Boom  Exports surged an annual 78 percent to 25,129 in February,
said the association, which expects exports to reach 300,000
vehicles this year.  “The outlook for 2011 in terms of total industry sales
remained positive,” the association said. “Domestically, new
vehicle sales over the medium term would remain a function of
the performance of the South African economy, and in the case of
export sales the sustainability of the recovery in the global
economy.”  South Africa has seven vehicle assembly plants, run by
companies including Volkswagen AG, General Motors Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp.,  Daimler AG  said on Dec. 7 it will invest an
additional 2 billion rand ($282 million) at its Mercedes-Benz
plant on South Africa’s southeast coast to build its latest C-
Class model from 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
