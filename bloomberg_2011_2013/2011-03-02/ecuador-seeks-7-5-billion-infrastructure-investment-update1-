  Ecuador ’s government is seeking $7.5
billion of private investment in infrastructure concessions over
the next five years, Production Minister Nathalie Cely said.  Companies including Portec and  Brazil ’s Bertolini Group are
studying concessions such as the port of Manta, Cely said today
in an interview at the Bloomberg Ecuador Economic Summit in  Quito . Spanish investors are seeking airport cargo operating
concessions, Cely said.  “Infrastructure investment is fundamental for our exports
to be able to compete,” Cely said. “At least seven companies
have shown interest in port and airport concessions.”  Ecuador, which is investing $4.5 billion in public spending
annually in infrastructure, is seeking to upgrade Pacific and
Amazon River ports, airports and highways to spur exports of
tuna, shrimp, bananas, flowers and textiles to markets including
the U.S.,  Europe  and Japan, fueling projected economic growth of
5.1 percent this year.  Ecuador’s exports led by crude oil jumped 26 percent to
$17.4 billion last year, according to the  central bank .  Ecuador’s 9.375 percent bonds due in 2015 gained 7.1
percent this year to 98.5 cents on the dollar, reducing the
yield by 1.77 percentage point to 9.77 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
