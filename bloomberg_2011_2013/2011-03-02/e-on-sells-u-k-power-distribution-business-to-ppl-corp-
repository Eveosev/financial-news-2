  PPL Corp ., owner of Pennsylvania’s
second-largest utility, agreed to buy  E.ON AG ’s U.K. power grid
for 4 billion pounds ($6.5 billion) in a deal that will triple
the U.S. company’s distribution customers in the country.  PPL will pay 3.5 billion pounds in cash and assume 500
million pounds of existing debt in its acquisition of Central
Networks, the second-biggest U.K. utility grid, the companies
said in separate statements. E.ON and PPL said they expect to
close the transaction in early April.  The acquisition marks PPL’s second purchase of assets from
Dusseldorf-based E.ON in less than a year. The company, based in
Allentown, Pennsylvania, agreed last April to buy two U.S.
utilities from E.ON for $6.7 billion. E.ON,  Germany ’s largest
utility, is selling assets as it seeks to raise 15 billion euros
($21 billion) by the end of 2013 to cut debt and fund
international expansion.  After the transaction is completed, PPL will own the
largest electric distribution network in the U.K. in terms of
regulated asset value, the company said in its statement. The
deal will add about 10 cents to 15 cents a share to 2011
earnings, according to PPL.  PPL already owns a  U.K. grid unit  with 83,000 kilometers
(50,000 miles) of power lines that serve 2.6 million customers
in south Wales and southwest England, according to its website.
E.ON’s U.K. grid has 133,000 kilometers of  power lines  that
serve more than 5 million customers in central  England ,
according to its website.  PPL fell 53 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $24.90 at 4:01 p.m.
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. PPL is
the worst performer for the past year among the 13 members of
Standard & Poor’s electric utilities index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
