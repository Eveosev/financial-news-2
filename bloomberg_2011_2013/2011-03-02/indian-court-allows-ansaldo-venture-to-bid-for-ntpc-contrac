A court in India directed the
federal government and state-owned  NTPC Ltd ., the nation’s
biggest electricity generator, to allow Ansaldo Caldaie Boilers
India Pvt. to bid for the supply of equipment for plants.  NTPC rejected Ansaldo Caldaie’s bid because it wasn’t a
qualified manufacturer. Ansaldo Caldaie, a venture between  Gammon India Ltd ., a construction company, and Italy’s Ansaldo
Caldaie SpA, contested the decision.  NTPC will allow the petitioner, in accordance with the
terms of the bid documents, to proceed to the next stage of
price bids and participate in the technical discussions, judges
Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Rajiv Shakdhar ruled in the Delhi High
Court yesterday.  The company may appeal to the Supreme Court, NTPC Chairman
Arup Roy Choudhury said by telephone yesterday.  The utility sought bids for equipment valued at 110 billion
rupees ($2.4 billion) for the expansion of its  power plants ,
said Prashant Kumar, Ansaldo’s lawyer.  NTPC is ordering 11 units of steam generators of 660
megawatts each for projects at Mouda, Solapur, Nabinagar, Meja
and Raghunathpur.  To contact the reporters on this story:
