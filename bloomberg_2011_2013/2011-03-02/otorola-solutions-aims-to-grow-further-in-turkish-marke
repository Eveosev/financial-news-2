(Corrects date in second paragraph of story published
March 2.)  Motorola Solutions Inc. is looking
closer at  Turkey  and Russia for growth opportunities including
acquisitions, said Massimo Sangiovanni, vice president for  Europe , the Middle East and Africa.  Motorola Inc. became Motorola Solutions on Jan. 4 after
completing the spinoff of Motorola Mobility Inc. as a separate
company. Motorola Solutions, which will continue the business of
two-way radio and scanning gear units, aims to maintain
“double-digit” growth in Turkey, which it sees as a strategic
market, Sangiovanni said at a news conference in Istanbul today.  Motorola Solutions has $3 billion in net cash and it can
spend it for “organic and inorganic growth” in the Europe,
Middle East and Africa region, Sangiovanni said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
