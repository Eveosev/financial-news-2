Asian stocks advanced, rebounding
from yesterday’s retreat, as reports from the U.S. to  South
Korea  showed improving economic growth and crude oil retreated
from a 29-month high.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. led airlines higher, rallying 2.1
percent as oil dropped the most in a week amid reports of a
peace plan in Libya. Doosan Infracore Co., South Korea’s largest
maker of construction equipment, and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  climbed
more than 2 percent in Seoul after the nation’s industrial
production quickened.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  led gains by
Chinese lenders after  Sanford Bernstein  raised its earnings
estimates for the industry.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.7 percent to 138.33 at
5:07 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge retreated 1.2 percent yesterday
and erased its gains this year amid concern surging crude oil
will jeopardize the global economic recovery.  “Positive economic data is boosting sentiment, though we
need to see the sustainability of such an expansion,” said Kim Young Joon, head of equities at NH-CA Asset Management Co. in  Seoul , which manages the equivalent of $8.9 billion in assets.
“The market performed really badly last month and a rebound at
this point seems quite natural as well.”  A U.S. report yesterday from ADP Employer Services showed
employment in the world’s largest economy increased 217,000 last
month, beating the median economists forecast of 180,000. The  Federal Reserve  separately said the labor market improved
throughout the U.S. early this year, driven by increasing retail
sales and “solid growth” in manufacturing.  U.S. Futures Rise  In South Korea, factory output increased 13.7 percent in
January from a year earlier, according to Statistics Korea. That
also topped the median economist estimate for a 12.4 percent
gain.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 0.5
percent today, indicating the benchmark index may extend
yesterday’s 0.2 percent advance. South Korea’s Kospi Index
advanced 2.2 percent, the most among benchmark equity gauges in
the Asia-Pacific region. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose
0.9 percent, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index increased 0.3
percent.  The MSCI index extended gains as crude fell as much as 1.8
percent in  New York  after the Wall Street Journal said
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called Libyan leader  Muammar
Qaddafi  and offered to help create a mediation commission.  Oil, Airlines  Crude for April delivery jumped 2.6 percent to $102.23 a
barrel in New York yesterday, the highest settlement since Sept.
26, 2008, after fighting in Libya renewed concern that supply
disruptions may spread to the Middle East.  Speculation about possible peace in Libya “defuses the
potential for military action in the region,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion at Pengana Capital Ltd.
in  Melbourne . “A Chavez-led alternative is probably more
palatable to not only Libya, but also to its neighbors in the
Middle East.”  Singapore Airlines climbed 2.1 percent to S$13.62. Qantas
Airways Ltd.,  Australia ’s largest carrier, advanced 1.3 percent
to A$2.31, and Air China Ltd., the country’s No. 1 international
carrier, gained 2.8 percent to HK$7.44 in Hong Kong.  A leading index of South Korean economic indicators, which
forecasts business activity, rose 3 percent in January from a
year earlier, compared with a revised 2.8 percent gain in
December, today’s report showed.  Korean Stocks Gain  Doosan Infracore advanced 6.3 percent to 26,350 won and
Hyundai Motor, South Korea’s largest automaker, gained 2.8
percent to 184,000 won.  Hanwha Chem Corp. (009830)  jumped 8.1 percent to
35,450 won after Shinhan Investment Corp. said the company’s
operating profit may rise 25 percent this year.  China Construction Bank, the country’s second-biggest
lender by market value, gained 1 percent to HK$6.89, and
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world’s No. 1
lender by market value, increased 1 percent to HK$6.07.  Sanford Bernstein analysts raised their 2011-12 profit
estimates for Chinese lenders by an average 7 percent to reflect
higher net-interest margins because of increases in the nation’s
interest rates. They also forecast “strong” first-quarter
earnings for banks.    Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , a bank that yesterday reported its
seventh successive year of record profit, gained 4.4 percent to
HK$214.80 in  Hong Kong  after Royal Bank of Scotland Plc raised
its recommendation for the lender to “buy” from “hold” and
lifted its share price estimate by 7.8 percent to HK$254.37.  BYD Co. surged 5.1 percent to HK$35 after the Chinese
automaker backed by  Warren Buffett  received a business license
from authorities for a venture with Daimler AG.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4 percent by the S&P
500 and 2.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
