  Kenya ’s government set aside 4.3
billion shillings ($51.8 million) to buy fertilizers for small-
scale farmers, Business Daily reported.  An international tender announced last week called for
23,000 metric tons of di-ammonium phosphate, 15,000 tons of
calcium ammonium nitrate and 5,000 tons each of NPK, or
nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium, and urea, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing Romano Kiome, permanent secretary in the
Agriculture Ministry.  Kenya’s government has over the past year tripled its share
of fertilizer imports into the country to 22 percent from 8
percent previously, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
