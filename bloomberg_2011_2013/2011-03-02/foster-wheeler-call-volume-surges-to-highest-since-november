  Foster Wheeler AG  call volume surged
to its highest level since November after the engineering and
construction group won a contract in  Abu Dhabi .  More than 10,500 calls to buy the stock changed hands
today, 3.7 times the four-week average and more than 10 times
the number of puts to sell. The most-traded contracts were the
March $39 calls, which accounted for more than one-third of all
call volume and jumped 24 percent to 26 cents each. Open
interest for the contract was 887 before today. Foster Wheeler,
which is based in Geneva, gained 0.7 percent to $35.73.  The company gained 45 percent in the past year, compared
with a 28 percent increase in the Nasdaq Industrial Index.
Foster Wheeler won a contract from oil company Zakum Development
Co. to study the expansion of Zirku oil processing facilities,
according to a press release today.  Foster Wheelerâ€™s implied volatility, the key gauge of
option prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose
to 42.87 from 41.99 yesterday.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
