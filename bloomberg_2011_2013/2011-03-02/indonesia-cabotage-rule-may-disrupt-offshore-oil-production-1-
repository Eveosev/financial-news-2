  Indonesia ’s offshore oil and gas
output may drop as production and shipment of the fuels using
foreign-owned vessels will be banned under the cabotage rule
starting May 7, the nation’s oil and gas regulator said.  Offshore oil output may drop by 156,020 barrels a day and
gas output may fall by 2,549 million standard cubic feet a day,
R. Priyono, chairman at the regulator, BPMigas, said during a
parliament hearing in Jakarta today. Gas output at PT Total EP
Indonesia,  ConocoPhillips  Indonesia and PT Energi Mega Persada
may be affected, Priyono said.  The government proposed revising the cabotage rule to
exempt foreign vessels in the oil and gas industry until their
contracts expire, Priyono said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
