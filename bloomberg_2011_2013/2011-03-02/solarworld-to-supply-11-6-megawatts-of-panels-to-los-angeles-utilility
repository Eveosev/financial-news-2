  Solarworld AG , Germany’s second
largest solar company by market value, will supply 11.6
megawatts of panels and electrical equipment to the  Los Angeles 
Department of Water & Power.  LADWP, the nation’s largest municipal utility, will buy
more than 46,000 panels from Solarworld for a power plant the
two companies are jointly developing on a 42-acre site in
Adelanto, California, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of
Los Angeles, the municipal utility said today in a statement.  The utility said the project is being funded by bonds offered
through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and will
generate enough power to supply about 86,000 homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
