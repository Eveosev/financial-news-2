  Iberdrola Renovables SA , the clean-
energy unit of  Spain ’s Iberdrola SA, said it will limit
investments in 2012 as it aims to increase profitability.  The world’s biggest clean-energy producer said it planned
total new capacity of 1,450 megawatts in 2011 and 750 megawatts
in 2012. In the United States, it will limit new capacity to 650
megawatts in 2011 and 350 megawatts in 2012, the company said in
a presentation filed with regulators.  The Valencia-based company also said it is aiming for free
cash flow of more than 500 million euros ($689 million) in 2012.  Renovables shares fell as much 2.4 percent in Madrid, the
