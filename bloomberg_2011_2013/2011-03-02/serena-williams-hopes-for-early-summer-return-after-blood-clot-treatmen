  Serena Williams  said she hopes to
return to competitive tennis in ``early summer'' after treatment
for a blood clot, a timetable that would knock her out of the
French Open and jeopardize defending her championship at
Wimbledon.  The 13-time tennis Grand Slam singles champion said in a
news release that she was at home and “doing better.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
