  Micro Focus International Plc  surged
the most in 15 months in London trading amid speculation the  software company  may be a takeover target.  The shares jumped 9.5 percent to 311.6 pence, the biggest
gain since November 2009, as of the 4:30 p.m. close in London.
That gives the Newbury, England-based company a market value of
641 million pounds ($1 billion).  “Bid rumors are doing the rounds,” said Will Hedden, a
sales trader at IG Index in London. “We saw the newswire
earlier about SAP being a possible buyer, since then we heard
there may be another. It’s not surprising that they are a
potential target after that sharp fall last month.”  Micro Focus tumbled 26 percent on Feb. 15 after saying
quarterly earnings failed to meet its forecasts.  Charles Palmer, a spokesman for Micro Focus at Financial
Dynamics, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
