  ITV Plc , the U.K.’s biggest
commercial broadcaster, rose the most since November 2009 in
London trading after full-year profit almost tripled on a
rebound in  television advertising .  ITV jumped 9.3 percent to 93.45 pence. Net income for 2010
advanced to 269 million pounds ($437 million), or 6.9 pence a
share, from 91 million pounds, or 2.3 pence, the London-based
company said in a statement today. Revenue rose 10 percent to
2.06 billion pounds. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had
estimated sales of 2.07 billion pounds and profit of 169.6
million pounds.  The company reported “earnings per share 14 percent above
our forecasts, driven higher by broadcasting/online
profitability and lower net interest,” Omar Sheikh, an analyst
at Credit Suisse, said in a note today. ITV’s net debt at 188
million pounds was lower than Credit Suisse’s estimate of 304
million pounds, he said.  ITV, whose shows include “Britain’s Got Talent” and “X
Factor,” said it will pay its first dividend since January
2009. The company said a recovery of the ad market was “very
helpful,” and it’s continuing to invest in technology and
online operations, as well as creating more content, to protect
itself against future volatile advertising.  Revenue Forecast  “We remain cautious and will continue to plan prudently,
in terms of the economic outlook and its impact on the TV
advertising market,” Chief Executive Adam Crozier said in the
statement. First-quarter revenue from  TV advertising  should rise
by 12 percent, while initial forecasts are for April to be 8
percent to 12 percent higher, he said. “The outlook into the
rest of 2011 remains uncertain.”  Comparatives will become increasingly difficult as this
year progresses and benefits of last year’s soccer  World Cup  are
absent, he said. ITV cut 40 million pounds of costs in 2010, and
will trim a further 15 million pounds this year, Crozier said.  ITV, which receives about 70 percent of its revenue from
advertising, aims to get half from other sources within five
years, the company said in a plan announced last year.  Crozier, who joined ITV last April, is seeking to boost
revenue from pay-TV and is also investing in the company’s
website. The company plans to spend 25 million pounds this year
on online, content and digital channels, today’s statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
