Transnet Ltd.,  South Africa ’s state-
owned logistics company, said it will buy an extra 32 trains
from Japan’s Mitsui & Co. as it increased its five-year spending
plan to 110 billion rand ($15.9 billion).  The locomotives will be delivered between May 2012 and
August 2013 and will run between South Africa’s Sishen iron ore
mine and the port of Saldanha, Johannesburg-based Transnet said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Transnet is raising its five-year capital expenditure plan
from the 93.4 billion rand announced in October as it expands
its rail network, upgrades its ports and builds a new fuel
pipeline between the commercial hub of Gauteng and the east
coast port city of Durban.  About half of the planned expenditure will be on Transnet’s
freight rail division, the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
