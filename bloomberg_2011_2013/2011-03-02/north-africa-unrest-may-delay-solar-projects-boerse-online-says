Unrest in North African nations may
delay some of the solar power projects the Desertec Foundation
plans in the region to help meet European electricity demand,
Boerse Online said, citing Desertec founder Gerhard Knies.  Desertec is making most progress in  Morocco  and could build
three or four solar thermal power plants there with a combined
capacity of as much as 500 megawatts by 2015, the German news
website cited Knies as saying in a summary of an interview to be
published tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
