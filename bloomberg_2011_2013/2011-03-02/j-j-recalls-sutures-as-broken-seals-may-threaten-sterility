  Johnson & Johnson , the world’s
largest maker of health-care products, recalled four types of
sutures over concerns about possible contamination, the U.K.’s
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said today.  The sutures were recalled Dec. 29 by  New Brunswick , N.J.-
based J&J after finding that packs may have incomplete seals,
threatening the product’s sterility, the agency said in a
 statement  posted on its website.  The recall affects the Ethilon, Ethibond, Mersilene and
Mersilk sutures made by J&J’s Ethicon unit, the statement said.
The agency said health-care providers should avoid using the
products and return them to the manufacturer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
