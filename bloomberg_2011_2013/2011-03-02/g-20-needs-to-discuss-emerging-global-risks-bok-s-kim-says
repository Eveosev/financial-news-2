Group of 20 policy makers should
discuss how they can detect and tackle emerging global systemic
risks, including social unrest, Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said.  Kim also said that a global financial crisis can take place
in any form anywhere and anytime and countries, especially G-20
members, should cooperate on resolving global imbalances,
according to a statement released in  Seoul  today based on
remarks he will deliver at an international symposium hosted by
the Bank of  France  on March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
