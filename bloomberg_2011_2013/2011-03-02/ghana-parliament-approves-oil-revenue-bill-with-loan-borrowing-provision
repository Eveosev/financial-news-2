  Ghana ’s Parliament approved a policy
to govern how revenue from the country’s nascent oil sector will
be spent, Emmanuel Ladzagla, a clerk at the body, said today.  The bill, passed after at least five months of debate, will
allow the West African nation to borrow against future oil
revenue for loans, he said by phone from the capital, Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
