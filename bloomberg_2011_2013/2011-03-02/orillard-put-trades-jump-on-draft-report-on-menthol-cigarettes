  Lorillard Inc . put volume reached a
record after a draft Food and Drug Administration advisory panel
report said smokers don’t face more risks of tobacco-related
disease from menthol cigarettes than unflavored ones.  More than 38,500 puts to sell the stock changed hands
today, 5.5 times the four-week average and 5.5 times the number
of calls to buy. The most-active contracts were the April $65
puts, which accounted for almost three-tenths of all put volume
and gained 7.1 percent to $1.96. The contracts had an open
interest of 2,341 before today. The Greensboro, North Carolina-
based company dropped 0.9 percent to $77.29.  Lorillard’s Newport is the top-selling menthol brand with
$5 billion a year in revenue, followed by Marlboro Menthol from  Altria Group Inc . and  Reynolds American Inc .’s Camel Menthol,
Kool and Salem, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Menthol
products account for about 30 percent of the $85 billion in
annual U.S. cigarette sales. Lorillard has advanced 4.4 percent
in the past year, less than the 7.8 percent increase for
consumer-staples companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
