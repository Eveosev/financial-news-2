  Swiss Life Holding AG ,  Switzerland ’s
biggest life insurer, raised its dividend as second-half profit
more than doubled on cost cutting and better investment returns.  Net income rose to 289 million Swiss francs ($312 million)
in the six months to Dec. 31 from 136 million francs a year
earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations that were confirmed
by the Zurich-based company. That beat the 245 million-franc
median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
insurer raised its dividend by 88 percent to 4.50 francs.  Swiss Life is more than three-quarters through a program to
reduce costs by as much as 400 million francs. The insurer plans
to cut its reliance on investment income by boosting earnings
from AWD Holding AG, the German financial-services broker
acquired in 2008, and from its business selling life products,
known as wrappers, to wealthy clients.  “In addition to the improvements at operational level,
continuing disciplined cost reduction and an outstanding
investment result, is the pleasing increase in new business
margins,” Chief Executive Officer Bruno Pfister said today in a
statement. “We intend to make further improvements at
operational level in 2011.”  Swiss Life’s full-year investment result was 4.6 billion
francs, corresponding to a net return of 4.1 percent compared
with 3.9 percent a year earlier.  Wrapper Business  Premiums in the “other” segment, which gets as much as 95
percent of its business selling life policies via units in
Luxembourg, Liechtenstein and  Singapore , increased 4 percent to
5.2 billion francs. Total gross written premiums and deposits
for the company were little changed at 20.2 billion francs,
Swiss Life said.  AWD met its full-year target after reporting earnings
before interest of 49 million euros ($67 million), Swiss Life
said.  Swiss Life said its solvency ratio, a measure of an
insurer’s ability to absorb losses, increased to 172 percent for
the full year. The company “comfortably” meets Swiss solvency
test requirements that were introduced in January, and has a
ratio well above 100 percent, Swiss Life said.  The insurer confirmed its goals for 2012, targeting a
return on equity of 10 percent to 12 percent by 2012 and a new
business margin of 2.2 percent compared with the 1.4 percent
reported for 2010.  Full-year net income rose to 557 million francs from 278
million francs in 2009, Swiss Life said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
