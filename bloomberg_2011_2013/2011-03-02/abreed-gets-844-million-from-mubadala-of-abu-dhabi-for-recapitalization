National Central Cooling Co., the
United Arab Emirates company known as Tabreed, said it will
receive 3.1 billion dirhams ($844 million) from Mubadala
Development Co. as part of a recapitalization.  “We are in the final stages of our recapitalization
program,” Chief Financial Officer Stephen Ridlington said on a
conference call today. “The program will leave Tabreed with a
stable long-term  capital structure  and the funding to complete
its business plan and support the growth of the company.”  The agreement with Abu Dhabi’s investment arm provides
Tabreed with long-term capital comprised of 1.7 billion dirhams
in subordinated mandatory convertible notes maturing 2019 and a
subordinated convertible loan facility for as much as 1.4
billion dirhams maturing at the end of December 2012, he said.  The Abu Dhabi-based company, which builds and operates
cooling and conditioning systems, reached a 2.63 billion-dirham
refinancing agreement with banks and is in talks with sukuk-
holders to settle a 246.5 million-dirham payment on 1.7 billion
in Islamic bonds, Ridlington said. The recapitalization program
closes March 31, he said.  Tabreed is looking for opportunities in  Abu Dhabi , Qatar
and  Saudi Arabia , Managing Director Khaled al Qubaisi said at a
conference in Abu Dhabi today. The company, which is looking for
projects with a 15 percent minimum return on equity, will
design, build and operate cooling facilities for  King Abdullah
Economic City , a $27 billion development on Saudi Arabia’s Red
Sea coast, al Qubaisi said.  Stock Split  The company got approval in December for a so-called
reverse stock split that took effect Dec. 12, lifting the share
price above 1 dirham and enabling it to raise additional
capital. The utility company, which reported a net income of
136.8 million dirhams for 2010 after a loss of 1.12 billion
dirhams a year earlier, hasn’t decided on a payment plan for its
$200 million sukuk maturing in July. The company doesn’t need to
sell assets and is generating enough cash, al Qubaisi said.  The shares, which have fallen 42 percent so far this year,
dropped 7 percent in trading in Dubai to 975 fils, the lowest
since August 2002, as of 1:22 p.m.  To contact the reporters on this story:
