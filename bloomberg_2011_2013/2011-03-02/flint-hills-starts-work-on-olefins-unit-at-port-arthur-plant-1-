Flint Hills Resources LLC started
maintenance to replace a de-ethanizer reboiler associated with a
light olefins unit at its chemical plant in  Port Arthur ,  Texas ,
according to a filing with state regulators.  “The nitrogen within this reboiler will be displaced, to
the LOU Flare, in preparation for placing the reboiler in
service,” the Wichita, Kansas-based company said in a  filing 
with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  Flaring associated with the maintenance started today at
8:40 a.m. local time and was expected to last 14 hours, the
filing said.  Katie Stavinoha, a company spokeswoman based in Houston,
declined to comment on plant operations.  Flint Hills is a subsidiary of Koch Industries Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
