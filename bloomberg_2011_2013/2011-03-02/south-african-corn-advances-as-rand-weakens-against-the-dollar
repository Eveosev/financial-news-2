Corn rose in  South Africa , the
largest producer of the grain on the continent, as the rand
weakened against the dollar, making imports more expensive for
local millers.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract,
gained 17 rand, or 1 percent, to 1,670 rand ($239) a metric ton
on the South African Futures Exchange. Meal made from the grain
is the countryâ€™s staple food.  The rand traded at 6.9875 to the dollar at 9:17 a.m.
Johannesburg time, compared with 6.9577 at the close of grain
trading at noon yesterday.  Yellow corn for July delivery rose 13 rand, or 0.8 percent,
to 1,715 rand a ton. The grain is mainly used as  animal feed  in
South Africa.  Wheat for May delivery declined 10 rand, or 0.3 percent, to
3,180 rand a ton.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today are as follows. All prices are in rand,
and the crops are sold in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
