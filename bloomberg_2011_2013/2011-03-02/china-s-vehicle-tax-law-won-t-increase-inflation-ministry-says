  China ’s new auto law which increased
taxes on vehicles with larger engines won’t be inflationary
because the tax amount won’t significantly impact purchase
prices and taxpayers, the Ministry of Finance said.  The linking of taxes to vehicles’ emission standards
will help protect the environment and conserve energy, the
ministry said in a statement on its website, outlining the
reasons for the law introduced Feb. 25.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
