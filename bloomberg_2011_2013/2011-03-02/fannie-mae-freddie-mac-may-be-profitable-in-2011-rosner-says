  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , the
government-sponsored entities that have drawn more than $154
billion in U.S. aid since 2008, may return to profitability by
the end of 2011, according to Graham Fisher & Co. Managing
Director Joshua H. Rosner.  “They’ll probably be profitable by the end of the year,”
Rosner said today in  New York  during a Bloomberg Link conference
on insurance portfolio strategies.  Since the U.S. put the companies in conservatorship in
2008, they have drawn on Treasury Department aid to remain
solvent. Congress and the Obama administration are examining
plans for winding down the companies and building a new system
for financing housing debt.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were created decades ago to
encourage homeownership by making it easier for people to get
loans. The firms own or guarantee more than half of all U.S.
mortgage debt, most of which they pool and sell on the secondary
market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
