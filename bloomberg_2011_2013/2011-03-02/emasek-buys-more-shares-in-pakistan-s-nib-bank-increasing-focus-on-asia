Temasek Holdings Pte, the biggest
shareholder of  NIB Bank Ltd ., bought more shares in the
Pakistani lender as Singapore’s state-owned investment company
increases holdings in  Asia .  Temasek bought 6.35 billion rupees ($74 million) of NIB
Bank’s shares, representing its portion of the lender’s rights
offer, the bank said in a statement to the  Karachi Stock
Exchange . The Singapore company will also subscribe to any
portion of NIB Bank’s 8.58 billion rupees rights offering that
isn’t taken up, the Karachi-based lender said.  The Singapore firm’s participation in rights offerings by
companies in its portfolio bolstered holdings. Temasek’s assets
climbed 43 percent to S$186 billion ($146 billion) in the year
to March 31, with Asian investments outside of Singapore and
Japan making up 46 percent of the portfolio, according to the
company’s  annual report  published in July.  Temasek owned 74 percent of NIB Bank as of March 31, 2010,
according to the annual report. It bought more shares in the
bank through Fullerton Financial Holdings Pte, which invests in
financial institutions in emerging markets.  NIB Bank offered about 6.26 billion of rights shares at
1.37 rupees each, according to the statement. While the stock
jumped 9.2 percent to 2.60 rupees yesterday, it has declined 38
percent since April 15.  The lender’s paid-up capital will increase to 103 billion
rupees after the rights offer, it said.  The bank reported a loss of 10.1 billion rupees in 2010,
after it took a charge of about 9.9 billion rupees in provisions,
according to the statement.  NIB Bank said it has begun to experience a “strong”
recovery and expects to “reverse a sizeable portion of these
provisions” as it seeks to recover non-performing loans through
negotiations and legal action against defaulting customers. It
remains a “liquid, well-capitalized and sound” bank, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
