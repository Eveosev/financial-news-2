Ireland’s budget deficit narrowed 19
percent in the two months through February compared with a year
earlier as the country’s tax take rose and spending declined.  The deficit of 1.95 billion euros ($2.7 billion) compared
with a shortfall of 2.45 billion euros a year earlier, the
 Finance Ministry  in Dublin said in a statement today. Tax
revenue rose 2.2 percent, while spending fell 2.4 percent.  Fine Gael and the  Labour Party  are continuing talks today
to form a coalition following national elections on Feb. 25 that
saw them emerge as the two biggest parties in the parliament.
The parties have differed on how to trim the deficit, which
reached about 12 percent of gross domestic product last year,
four times the European Union limit.  Income-tax receipts surged 25 percent in the two-month
period compared with a year earlier, boosted by tax increases
and a new Universal Social Charge introduced in the budget in
December, the ministry said. Sales-tax receipts declined. Within
spending, capital expenditure dropped 52 percent and current
spending rose 3.4 percent.  Fine Gael leader  Enda Kenny  wants to speed up planned
spending cuts to narrow the budget gap, while Labour is pushing
for more tax increases in its fiscal plan. The new parliament is
due to meet on March 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
