Global  oil prices  will probably
decline to below $100 a barrel as Saudi Arabia releases supply
from its reserves and demand drops from elevated December
levels, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  The rise in prices is “manageable” and central banks are
unlikely to raise interest rates “on account of oil alone,”  Andrew Garthwaite , an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note
dated today. Still, any rally driving Brent crude 100 percent
higher year-on-year to between $140 and $155 a barrel may be a
“trigger point” that has historically led to equities
“correcting” by 34 percent, he wrote.  Countries that are significant energy importers and where
energy accounts for a large part of the consumer price index
such as India, Thailand, the Philippines,  Czech Republic  and
Poland are among the potential losers, according to the report.  Russia, Colombia, Australia, Canada, Malaysia and Norway
are potential winners as they are net exporters of oil, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
