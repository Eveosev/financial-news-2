Options investors made bullish  Weatherford International Ltd . trades as the stock plunged the
most since March 2009 after the oilfield-services provider
delayed its annual report.  One investor bought 5,000 January $22.50 calls for $2.10
apiece at 9:35 a.m. in New York and the same number of January
$25 calls for $1.35 each four seconds later, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and a report by  Patrick Mortimer , director
of options trading at Pipeline Trading Systems LLC in  New Hope ,  Pennsylvania .  Weatherford calls had some of the biggest losses in the
U.S. options market today, while puts posted some of the biggest
gains, with the March $22 puts surging to $1.18 from 20 cent
yesterday. More than 126,000 calls changed hands as today, nine
times the four-week average and more than twice the number of
puts. Call volume surpassed yesterday’s one-year high, and put
trades surged to their highest level since October 2009. Geneva-
based Weatherford tumbled 10 percent to $21.14.  “Early option activity suggests at least one investor
could be using the drop in share price” to create a bullish
position through January, Mortimer wrote in today’s report.  Weatherford yesterday said it won’t be able to file its
annual report on time and expects to reduce past earnings by
$500 million because of accounting errors from 2007 to 2010.
Inadequate staffing and technical expertise contributed to the
problem, the company said.  Weatherford’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option
prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days spiked to
42.54, the highest since July, from 39.11 yesterday.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
