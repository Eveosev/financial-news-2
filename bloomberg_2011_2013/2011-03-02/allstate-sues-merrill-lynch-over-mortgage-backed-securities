  Allstate Corp ., the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, sued Bank of America Corp.’s
Merrill Lynch unit over claims it fraudulently sold the insurer
about $167 million of residential mortgage-backed securities.  Allstate asked for damages including the lost market value
of the securities, plus principal and interest payments in the
complaint filed today in New York state Supreme Court. Allstate
filed a similar lawsuit against  Credit Suisse Group AG  units
yesterday in the same court over more than $231 million of the
securities.  The insurer, based in Northbrook, Illinois, last month sued
JPMorgan Chase & Co. over $700 million of mortgage-backed
securities the bank sold the insurer;  Citigroup Inc ., over more
than $200 million; and  Deutsche Bank AG , over about $185
million. Allstate said the banks misrepresented underwriting
standards, owner occupancy data and loan-to-value ratios.  “Because of the systemic abandonment of underwriting
standards and the resulting inclusion of toxic, highly risky
mortgage loans to back the certificates, most of Allstate’s
certificates have been downgraded from the highest possible
ratings to junk-bond ratings,” Allstate said in the Merrill
Lynch complaint.  Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Merrill Lynch,
650559/2011, New York state Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
