  South Korea â€™s government said it
expects consumer-price inflation to stabilize from next quarter
and unveiled measures to tame price pressures after a report
showed the inflation rate surged to a two-year high.  The government plans to expand overseas food producing
business to secure food supplies as well as undergo an energy-
saving campaign in wake of an increase in energy prices, the  finance ministry  said in a statement today.  Global oil prices will probably remain volatile, the
government said. Inflation will probably moderate on lower fuel
demand and a rebound in the supply of agriculture products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
