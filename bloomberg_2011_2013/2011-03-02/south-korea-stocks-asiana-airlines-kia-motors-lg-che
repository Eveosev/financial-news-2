Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  South Korea  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 3 p.m. close in Seoul. South
Korean financial markets were closed yesterday for a public
holiday.  The  Kospi Index  fell 11.06, or 0.6 percent, to 1,928.24,
the lowest since Nov. 30.  Airlines: Korean Air Lines Co. (003490 KS), South Korea’s
largest carrier, fell 0.8 percent to 61,000 won.  Asiana Airlines 
Inc. (020560 KS) lost 4.7 percent to 9,720 won, the lowest since
Jan. 7. Oil gained for a second day in New York, trading above
$100 a barrel, as demonstrations in Iran stoked concern the
turmoil spreading across the Middle East may disrupt supplies
from OPEC’s second-largest producer. Fuel accounts for more than
30 percent of operating costs for Korean Air, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.    Kia Motors Corp . (000270 KS), an affiliate of Hyundai Motor
Co., gained 2.4 percent to 58,800 won. Sales for February rose
28 percent from a year earlier, according to a filing.  Korea Zinc Co. (010130 KS), which produces gold and silver,
gained 0.8 percent to 336,500 won. Gold traded near a record and
silver advanced to the highest level since 1980 as turbulence in
the Middle East drove up oil prices, boosting demand for the
metals as haven investments and hedges against inflation.    LG Chem Ltd . (051910 KS), South Korea’s biggest chemicals
maker, gained 3.1 percent to 383,500 won, the most since Feb. 17.
The shares are “undervalued” and the chemical maker’s glass
business for liquid crystal display will help boost its earnings,
Dongbu Securities Co. said in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
