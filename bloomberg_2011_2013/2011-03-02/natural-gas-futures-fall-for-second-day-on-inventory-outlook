Natural gas futures fell for a
second day on forecasts that a government report tomorrow will
show a smaller-than-average decline in U.S. stockpiles.  Gas dropped 1.4 percent as the Energy Department may say
that inventories dipped 87 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Feb. 25, according to the median of 20 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average drop for the week
is 131 billion.  “The path of least resistance continues to be down and the
bears remain in control,” said Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke
Associates Inc., an energy trading firm in Louisville,  Kentucky .
“Unless the storage numbers come out in an extremely bullish
fashion, they are not going to have much of an impact on the
upside.”  Natural gas for April delivery fell 5.5 cents to settle at
$3.818 per million British thermal on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The futures have lost 13 percent this year.  Gas inventories dropped 81 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Feb. 18 to 1.83 trillion cubic feet, the Energy
Department’s report last week showed. That’s the smallest
withdrawal since the week ended Nov. 26.  A deficit to five-year average supplies for the week
narrowed to 3.2 percent from 6.3 percent the previous week,
department data showed.  U.S. gas production advanced 1.1 percent in December from
November, according to the department’s monthly  EIA-914  report.
Output in the lower 48 states increased for a second month,
advancing 0.2 percent to 66.76 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 66.6 billion.  Supply Outlook  Gas inventories may total 1.651 trillion cubic feet by the
end of March, down from 1.662 trillion a year earlier, the
Energy Department estimated on Feb. 8 in its monthly Short-Term
Energy Outlook.  “Gas production continues to grow and we are going to have
pretty high inventory levels,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of
research for IAF Advisors in Houston. “The weather is warming
up as winter is coming to an end.”  Temperatures may be normal or above-normal in the eastern
and southern U.S. from March 7 through March 11, according to
Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda,  Maryland . About 52 percent

Energy Department.  The low in New York on March 9 may be 42 degrees Fahrenheit
