The U.S. is stepping up efforts to
combat scams targeting the unemployed by promising jobs and the
opportunity to “be your own boss,” the Federal Trade
Commission announced.  Federal and state officials have brought actions -- such as
filing criminal charges or reaching settlements -- in dozens of
cases over the past year as part of a continuing enforcement
effort, said  Peter Kaplan , an FTC spokesman.  Cases cited by the agency in a  statement  today included
companies that charged people to help them develop their own
Internet businesses and advertised nonexistent sales jobs for
which they collected fees for background checks and other
services.  Victims “risked their limited financial resources in
response to the promise of a job, an income -- a chance at a
profitable home-based business,” said David C. Vladeck,
director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in the
statement. “These turned out to be empty promises, and the
people who counted on them ended up with high levels of
frustration and even higher levels of debt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
