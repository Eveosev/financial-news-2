  BBA Aviation Plc , a U.K. provider of
services to private and corporate jets, fell the most since
August in London trading after announcing plans for a share
placing to fund acquisitions.  BBA dropped 5.9 percent. The placing represents as much as
9.99 percent of existing share capital and will be used to
finance acquisitions and provide “flexibility to continue BBA
Aviation’s consolidation strategy,” the London-based company
said in a Regulatory News Service statement today.  The share price move is due to “the nature of the share
placing and some of the acquisition targets,” Siral Shah, an
analyst at Charles Stanley & Co. Ltd., said in a phone interview
today. Because of the acquisitions “earnings per share is going
to be slightly lower than some of the consensus forecasts,”
said Shah, who has put his ‘buy’ recommendation on the stock
under review.  BBA shares fell as much as 19.7 pence to 199.1 pence and
closed at 206 pence at 4:30 p.m. in  London , giving the company a
market value of 890.8 million pounds ($1.45 billion).  Net income for the year ended Dec. 31 climbed to 65.1
million pounds from 47.9 million pounds a year earlier, the
company said in a separate statement today. Total revenue rose
9.5 percent to 1.18 billion pounds, while flight support sales
increased 15 percent to 741.6 million pounds.  BBA also said today it is buying a fuel measurement
business from General Electric Co.’s aviation division for $62.5
million.  “2010 was a good year for BBA Aviation,” Chief Executive
Officer Simon Pryce said in today’s statement. “As our markets
continue their gradual recovery we expect to make further
progress in 2011. We expect to deliver a strong performance and
generate superior returns over the longer term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
