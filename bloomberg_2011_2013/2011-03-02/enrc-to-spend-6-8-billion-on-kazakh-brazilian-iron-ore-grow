Eurasian Natural Resources Corp., a
ferroalloy producer, plans to invest $6.8 billion to increase
iron-ore output in Kazakhstan and  Brazil  as prices for the
steelmaking ingredient climb.  ENRC, based in London, aims to become a “leading” global
iron-ore miner with annual output of 70 million metric tons by
2016, Chief Executive Officer Felix Vulis said yesterday at a
BMO Capital Markets conference in Hollywood,  Florida . The
company currently mines iron ore only in Kazakhstan, where its
annual production is 17 million saleable tons.  Mining companies are boosting investment in reserves of
iron ore and coal, both used to make steel, as Asian demand
drives up prices. The price of iron-ore imports to  China , the
world’s largest consumer of the raw material, jumped 70 percent
last year, while European benchmark coal rose 38 percent in
London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ENRC’s investment program includes $2.1 billion to expand
iron-ore operations in  Kazakhstan , where the company plans to
increase output to 23 million tons by 2015, according to Vulis’s
 presentation . ENRC earmarked the same amount for its Bahia
Mineracao Ltda project in Brazil, due to begin production in
2013 with an annual capacity of 19.5 million tons, he said.  In September, ENRC bought the shares it didn’t own in Bahia
Minerals BV and won an option to purchase Greystone Mineracao do
Brasil Ltda.  ENRC will also invest $2.6 billion to develop Brazil’s
Jiboia iron-ore site. The company plans to begin construction in
2013 and produce 25 million tons of ore a year by 2016,
according to the presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
