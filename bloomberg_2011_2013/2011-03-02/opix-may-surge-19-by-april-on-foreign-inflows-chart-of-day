The longest streak of net foreign
inflows to Japan’s stock market since 2005 may boost the Topix
index 19 percent by the end of April, if history is a guide,
according to Monex Group Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the Topix and net investments
from overseas. Foreigners were buyers of Japanese stocks for 16
weeks to Feb. 18, the longest continuous period of inflows since
the 26 weeks through Dec. 9, 2005, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The latest streak began as the U.S. Federal Reserve
announced in the first week of November that it would buy $600
billion of Treasuries. The 2005 stretch, during which the Topix
rose 38 percent, began as the government and the  Bank of Japan 
said the economy was recovering after a slump.  “The macro economy and the market cycles are similar to
those of 2005,” said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex
in Tokyo. While the net investment report for last week, due out
today, is expected to show a net outflow, “the foreign
investors’ buying trend won’t change, even if there is a
break,” he said.  The Topix rose 20 percent in the 16 weeks from Oct. 29 to
Feb. 18. If the gauge follows a similar pattern to 2005, then it
will rise to 1,119 by the end of April, Hiroki said. The index
closed at 942.87 yesterday.  While the 2005 streak of net purchases by overseas
investors ended in the week to Dec. 9 that year, the trend
continued, and the Topix rose to a 15-year high of 1,783.72 on
April 7, 2006. That was a 55 percent advance from end of the
second week of June 2005, just before the foreign buying streak
began.  “Funds tend to pour into Japanese stocks because people
think they’re sensitive to the world economy and there is little
fear of inflation,” said Gentoku Kiyokawa, a  fund manager  at
BNP Paribas Investment Partners in Tokyo. Inflows will continue
as long as investors hold the view the global economy is on a
path to recovery, Kiyokawa said.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporters on this story:
