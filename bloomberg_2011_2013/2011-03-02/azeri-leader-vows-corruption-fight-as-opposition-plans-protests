Azeri President Ilham Aliyev vowed
to fight corruption in the oil-exporting nation as the political
opposition called on the population to demand his resignation.  “Corruption and bribery are a serious woe and malady,”
Aliyev said in remarks published in the state-run Azarbaycan
newspaper today. “They are very damaging to us.”  Azerbaijan is one of the world’s most corrupt states,
ranking 134th out of 178 on Transparency International’s annual
index, alongside Nigeria, Zimbabwe and  Bangladesh . Aliyev took
over from his father in 2003 in the first dynastic succession in
the former  Soviet Union .  Opposition parties including Musavat are preparing for a
national “day of protest” on March 12. They are seeking to
replicate the uprisings that drove out rulers in Tunisia and  Egypt  after Aliyev won all but one of 125 seats in December
elections for parliament that European observers said were
neither free nor fair, Musavat chief Isa Qambar said last month.  “This is not a campaign, but our conscious choice,”
Aliyev said. The president has sacked dozens of officials since
the start of the year, including the heads of the prison service
and the national water utility, for alleged bribe-taking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
