Coface SA, the credit-insurance unit
of  Natixis  SA, dropped a plan to open a European ratings company
and said it will focus on its main business.  Coface had net income of 61 million euros ($84 million) in
2010, compared with a 163 million-euro net loss a year earlier,
the Paris-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.
Coface is seeking an “autonomous development,” it also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
