Nigeria’s Senate passed a bill
against  money laundering  that prescribes harsher sentences for
offenders and targets terrorist financing, according to the
official record of proceedings released yesterday.  The legislation, which replaces a version passed in 2004,
stipulates as much as 10 years in jail for offenders. The
maximum penalty was previously three years.  The law also targets proceeds from corruption, organized
crime, racketeering, drug trafficking and  tax evasion , according
David Mark, president of the Senate. President Goodluck Jonathan
needs to sign the legislation before it becomes law. Nigeria is
among 31 countries with deficiencies in its money laundering and
terrorist financing legislation, according to the inter-
governmental Financial Action Task Force.  Under the new law, all banks are required to appoint
compliance officers or face a fine. Individuals carrying more
than $10,000 in cash must declare such money to custom officials
at entry and exit points from the country.  The legislation also mandates all financial institutions to
report corporate transactions that exceed 10 million naira
($65,000) to the  Economic and Financial Crimes Commission , or
EFCC, and individual transactions in excess of 5 million naira.
Casinos and jewelers are also obliged to report transactions
which exceed the limit.  The regulators, including the central bank and the EFCC,
are empowered to place surveillance on suspected banks and gain
access to relevant records. The law does not allow for phone
taps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
