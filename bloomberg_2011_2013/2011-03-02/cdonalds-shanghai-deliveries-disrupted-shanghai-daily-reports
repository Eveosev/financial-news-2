  McDonald’s Corp . restaurants in
Shanghai temporarily suspended food-delivery service after the
chain’s phone system froze during an upgrade,  Shanghai  Daily
said, citing Liu Xiaolin, a company public relations officer.    The problem started at 12:45 p.m. local time yesterday and
was resolved at about 1:40 p.m., the English-language newspaper
said. The problem may recur because changes to the phone system
are continuing, Shanghai Daily said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
