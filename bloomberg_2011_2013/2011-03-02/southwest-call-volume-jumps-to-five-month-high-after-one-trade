  Southwest Airlines Co . call volume
jumped to its highest level since September after a single trade
with a strike price 3.7 percent above today’s close.  A block of 4,000 March $12 calls traded for 25 cents each
at 10:43 a.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The calls were exchanged 100 percent at the ask
price, indicating that a buyer initiated the transaction.  More than 9,100 calls to buy the stock of the world’s
largest low-fare carrier changed hands today, almost eight times
the four-week average and 32 times the number of puts to sell.
The March $12 calls, which were the most-traded contracts,
accounted for almost six-tenths of all call volume. The Dallas-
based airline dropped 1.2 percent to $11.57.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
