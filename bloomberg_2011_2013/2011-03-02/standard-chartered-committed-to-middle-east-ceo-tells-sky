  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  Chief
Executive Officer Peter Sands told Sky News the bank is
“committed” to its business in the Middle East, isn’t
“discouraged at all” by the developments in the region and is
continuing to invest there.  Asked whether unrest in Bahrain could spread and cause
protests to erupt in neighbouring countries, Sands said he
doesn’t think “it’s a tinderbox,” and the events in Tunisia
and  Egypt  have been “a catalyst for change” in the region.  While this creates a challenge, Sands said, “at one level
it’s a positive development” that could see these countries
moving to “another phase” of “economic, political and social
development.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
