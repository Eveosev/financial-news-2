The Australian dollar dropped from
within a half-cent of a two-month high against the greenback
after government reports showed home-building approvals slumped
in January and exports decreased.  The Aussie weakened against 11 of 16 major counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg as Barclays Plc forecast the extra yield
offered by the nation’s debt over  U.S. Treasuries  will shrink.
New Zealand’s dollar traded near a four-month low versus the yen
on speculation the central bank will cut  interest rates  next
week to help the economy recover from last month’s earthquake.  “The report on building approvals is weighing on the
Aussie,” said Takashi Kudo, general manager of market
information services in Tokyo at NTT SmartTrade Inc., a unit of
Japan’s biggest phone company. “With the worsening
fundamentals, a rate cut is more likely in New Zealand.”  Australia’s dollar slid 0.3 percent to $1.0134 at 11:34
a.m. in  New York , from $1.0169 yesterday, after rising on March
1 to $1.0202, the strongest level since Jan. 3. The currency
rose 0.4 percent to 83.54 yen, from 83.25.  New Zealand ’s dollar
depreciated 0.4 percent to 74.06 U.S. cents, from 74.32. The
kiwi appreciated 0.4 percent to 61.06 yen, from 60.84 yesterday,
when it slid to 60.47, the lowest level since Oct. 21.  The number of permits granted to build or renovate houses
and apartments in Australia dropped 15.9 percent in January, the
biggest decline since November 2002, the Bureau of Statistics
said. A separate report showed exports slid 4 percent, the most
since July 2010.  Yield Spread  The extra yield investors demand to hold Australian 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries narrowed to
1.97 percentage points, from as wide as more than 2.74
percentage points in November.  “On the assumption that  Australia ’s economy is linked
strongly to developments in  Asia , there does appear to be
justification for further Australia-U.S. 10-year spread
narrowing,” Gavin Stacey, an interest-rate strategist at
Barclays in Sydney, wrote in a report.  New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said in an interview in
Wellington that he would “welcome” interest-rate reductions by
the central bank as the nation grapples with the aftermath of
the deadliest earthquake in 80 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
