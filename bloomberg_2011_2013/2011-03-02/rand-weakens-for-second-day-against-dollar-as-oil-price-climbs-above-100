The rand gained against the dollar
as gold approached a record in London after unrest in  Libya  and
concern inflation will quicken spurred demand.  South Africa’s currency strengthened 0.9 percent to 6.9057
per dollar by 4:36 p.m. in Johannesburg, reversing earlier
losses of as much as 0.5 percent. Against the euro, the rand
added 0.5 percent to 9.5907 rand.  Gold, which with platinum accounts for about a fifth of
South Africa’s export revenue, climbed for a fourth day, rising
0.2 percent to $1,436.90 an ounce and oil rose as Libyan rebels
braced for renewed clashes with forces loyal to leader Muammar
Qaddafi. Concern about rising inflation and currency debasement
drove gold up 30 percent last year for a 10th annual gain.  “Precious metal exporters like South Africa have the
benefits of a weaker dollar and high commodity prices,”  Michael Keenan , a currency strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in
Johannesburg, wrote in a client note today.  Gold purchases in  China , the world’s largest producer,
climbed to 200 metric tons in the first two months of 2011 as
faster inflation boosted consumer demand, according to UBS AG,
which said the price may gain to $1,500.  Countries from China to Indonesia and Brazil raised  interest rates  this year to curb rising consumer prices. Euro-
area inflation expectations soared to the highest level in more
than two years last month as oil prices surged, hampering the  European Central Bank ’s task as it fights the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  Raising Rates  Oil also advanced as protests in  Iran  stoked concern that
political turmoil spreading across North Africa and the Middle
East may disrupt supplies from OPEC’s second-largest producer.  Government bonds rose in South Africa, with the 13.5
percent security due September 2015 climbing 21 cents to 121.70
rand. The yield on the security dropped 6.6 basis points to
7.731 percent.  South Africa yesterday sold $750 million of 6.25 percent
bonds due 2041, the Pretoria-based National Treasury said in an
e-mailed statement today. Demand for the securities, which were
priced to yield 6.292 percent, reached $3 billion, the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
