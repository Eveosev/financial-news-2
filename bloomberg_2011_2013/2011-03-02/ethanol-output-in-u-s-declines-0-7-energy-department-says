U.S. ethanol production fell 0.7
percent to 882,000 barrels a day last week, the lowest level
since November, according to the Energy Department.  Output tumbled a fifth week, the longest streak of declines
since the department began releasing weekly data in June, to the
lowest level since Nov. 5. Stockpiles dwindled 1.2 percent to
19.1 million barrels.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
rose 0.9 percent to 5 million barrels a day, the highest since
Dec. 24. Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon
of ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 0.5 cent to $2.59
a gallon at 10:36 a.m. New York time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have climbed 54 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
