Cash premiums for soybeans shipped
this month to terminals near  New Orleans  widened relative to
Chicago futures as farmers withheld supplies amid rising demand
and as rains delayed harvests in  Brazil . Corn basis narrowed.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
March at  Gulf of Mexico  ports was 63 cents to 64 cents a bushel
above May futures, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The
spot price for this month rose 22.25 cents, more than the 19.75-
cent gain in March futures in Chicago. The corn basis was 49
cents to 52 cents a bushel above May futures, down from 52 cents
to 53 cents.  “The forecast for continued rains in Brazil, delaying
harvest and shipping, supported U.S. futures and cash” soybean
markets, said Brian Basting, a market analyst for Advance
Trading Inc. in Bloomington,  Illinois . “There was enough corn
sold the last two weeks to satisfy current demand.”  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 19 cents, or 1.4
percent, to close at $13.9425 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. March futures rose 1.4 percent to
$13.8725.  Corn futures for May delivery dropped 14 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $7.215 a bushel. The price, which gained 89 percent
in the past year, reached $7.4425 on Feb. 22, the highest since
July 2008.  U.S. corn stockpiles on Aug. 31 will total 675 million
bushels, down 60 percent from a year earlier and below a January
forecast of 745 million, the USDA said on Feb. 9. That
represents 5 percent of projected annual usage, matching a low
set in the 1995-1996 marketing year, the agency said.  Soybean reserves will fall to 4.2 percent of estimated
annual demand before this year’s harvest, the USDA said.  “Supplies are going to be tight,” Basting said. “Until
the crops are planted and growing, the markets are going to stay
volatile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
