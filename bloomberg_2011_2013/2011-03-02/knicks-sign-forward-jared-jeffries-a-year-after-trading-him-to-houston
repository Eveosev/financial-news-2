Jared Jeffries returned to the  New
York Knicks  a year after the National Basketball Association
team traded him to the  Houston Rockets .  The 29-year-old forward was re-signed yesterday as a free
agent, Donnie Walsh, the Knicksâ€™ president of basketball
operations, said in a statement.  Jeffries, who originally signed with the Knicks on Aug. 8,
2006, has career averages of 5.2 points and 4.3 rebounds in 528
games.  The Knicks dropped to 30-28 with a 116-110 loss to the
Orlando Magic last night after beginning the fourth quarter with
an 84-79 lead. The Knicks, who are 2-2 since signing Carmelo Anthony, are second in the NBA Eastern Conference Atlantic
Division behind the Boston Celtics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
