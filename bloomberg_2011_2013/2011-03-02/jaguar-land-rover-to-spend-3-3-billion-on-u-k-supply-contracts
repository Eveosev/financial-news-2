Jaguar Land Rover, the luxury-car
unit of India’s  Tata Motors Ltd ., will spend more than 2 billion
pounds ($3.3 billion) on supply contracts with more than 40
companies for its new Range Rover Evoque model.  Companies including International Automotive Components,  Johnson Controls Inc . and  Magna International Inc . won orders,
Jaguar Land Rover said today in a statement. The U.K.
government’s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
estimates that the contracts will create 5,000 jobs in supply
businesses, it said in a separate statement. The jobs are all in
the U.K., the department said.  “The billions being spent on Evoque is just the start,
with 40 significant product actions coming over the next five
years,” Ralf Speth, chief executive officer of Jaguar Land
Rover, said in the company’s statement. “This will mean a high
level of investment by us in the future and represents a
tremendous opportunity for U.K. suppliers.”  The Evoque, a sport utility-coupe crossover, was developed
with aid from the British government and will be built in
Halewood, near Liverpool. More than 100,000 customers globally
have registered an interest in the model, Jaguar Land Rover
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
