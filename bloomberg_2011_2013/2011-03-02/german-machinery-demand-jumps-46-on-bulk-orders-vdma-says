Plant and machinery orders in  Germany , Europe’s largest economy, jumped 46 percent in January
from a year earlier, boosted by demand for big-ticket items.  Domestic orders surged 53 percent in the year when adjusted
for inflation, while export orders increased 42 percent, the
Frankfurt-based VDMA machine makers’ association said in an e-
mailed statement today. In the three months through January,
orders rose 44 percent from the year-earlier period.  “Order intake continued to prove dynamic,” VDMA Chief
Economist Ralph Wiechers said in the statement. “Bulk orders
brought additional stimulus to a core business that’s already
performing well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
