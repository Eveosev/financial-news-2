A federal judge found in favor of
the NFL Players Union in its complaint about $4 billion of
contracts between the  National Football League  and television
companies.  U.S. District Judge David Doty, in  Minneapolis , overruled
an earlier decision on the matter by a special master, or
arbitrator, that the NFL can receive television revenue even if
games are wiped out this coming season by a labor dispute between
the league and its players.  “The court orders that a hearing be held concerning relief
to be granted to the players arising from the NFL’s breach,”
Doty concluded.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
