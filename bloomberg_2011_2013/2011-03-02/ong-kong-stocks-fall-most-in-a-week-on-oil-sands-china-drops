Hong Kong stocks fell by the most in
a week after oil prices surged to the highest level since
September 2008, raising concern more expensive energy costs will
derail global economic growth.    Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd ., the city’s biggest airline,
declined 2.6 percent after crude prices rallied above $100 a

curb higher prices.  Sands China Ltd . tumbled 6.3 percent after

Enterprises Index of H shares of Chinese companies lost 1.3
percent to 12,456.16.  “If we have oil prices above $100 a barrel for another two
or three months” there is a risk of a big dent in consumer
spending, Hans Goetti, chief investment officer for Asia at
Finaport Investment Intelligence told Bloomberg Television. “If
you have an oil shock and rising  oil prices , we always had a
recession, at least in previous cycles.”  Shipping and airlines declined after surging oil prices
damped their profit outlook. China Cosco Holdings Co., Asia’s
largest shipping line by market value, sank 1.7 percent to
HK$8.17, and Cathay Pacific dropped 2.6 percent to HK$17.84.
China Southern Airlines Co., the nation’s biggest carrier, sank

Qaddafi and after Al Arabiya television reported Iranian
protesters clashed with security forces in Tehran.  Developers had the biggest decline among the  Hang Seng
Index ’s four industry groups.  China Overseas Land & Investment
Ltd ., controlled by the nation’s construction ministry,
retreated 1.2 percent to HK$13, while China Resources Land Ltd.,
a state-controlled developer, lost 1.4 percent to HK$12.52.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd ., which gets all its revenue from
China, fell 1.3 percent to HK$10.52 after Credit Suisse Group AG
cut its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “outperform.”  “Imported inflationary pressure is increasing in China now
with oil prices surging,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West
China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “That’ll cause concerns the
government will further tighten measures to curb inflation.”  Sands China  The Hang Seng Index rose 1.6 percent this year through
yesterday as positive corporate earnings eased concern tighter

company, said it faced investigations from the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.  China Railway Construction Corp. dropped 7.5 percent to
HK$8.11 after the builder of more than half the nation’s

evacuated most of its workers.  Among stocks that rose, BYD Co., the Chinese carmaker part-
