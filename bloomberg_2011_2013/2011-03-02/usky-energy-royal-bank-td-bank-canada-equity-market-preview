Canadian stocks rose for a second
day after Royal Bank of  Canada  and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) 
reported earnings that beat analyst estimates as a rebounding
economy boosted fees from  consumer lending .  Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest lender by
assets, advanced 5.2 percent after it reported first-quarter
profit on an adjusted basis that beat the average analyst
estimate by 25 percent. Toronto-Dominion rose 3.9 percent after
reporting first-quarter profit excluding some items that beat
the average analyst estimate by 13 percent.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) 
declined 2.6 percent as the metal dropped.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 70.70
points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 14,214.72 in Toronto, the
highest level since June 2008.  “Toronto-Dominion and other Canadian banks don’t have
subprime worries,” said Paul Ma, who oversees C$500 million
($512.82 million) as a money manager at McLean & Partners in
Calgary. “If you look at income and lending, they are doing
really, really well and beating estimates. The only thing you
worry about is valuation.”  Fifty-four percent of the companies in the S&P/TSX that
have reported earnings since Jan. 10, have surpassed the average
analyst estimate. All six Canadian banks that posted results
have beaten forecasts as loan losses fell and consumer lending
climbed after Canada’s economy grew more than economists
forecast.  Soaring    Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  added 5.2 percent to C$59.92, the
highest price since May 19. Toronto-Dominion advanced 3.9
percent to C$83.60, the highest price since at least January
1983.  Barrick slumped 2.6 percent to C$51.10. Gold declined the
most in six weeks after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez offered
to mediate a resolution to the crisis in Libya. The Arab League
said it’s weighing the offer.  Gold futures for April delivery declined 1.5 percent to
settle at $1,416.40 in  New York . The precious metal had gained 9
percent from Jan. 27 through yesterday as unrest in northern
Africa and the Middle East spurred demand for a haven.  Oil declined for the first time in three days in New York,
as crude for April delivery slid 0.3 percent to settle at
$101.91 a barrel.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  slumped 3.2
percent to C$48.12, the biggest drop since Jan. 7. The nation’s
second-largest energy company reported fourth-quarter earnings
of 57 Canadian cents a share on an adjusted basis, missing the
average analyst estimate by 13 percent, Bloomberg data show.    Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  dropped 1.1 percent to C$45.50, the
first decline in five sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
