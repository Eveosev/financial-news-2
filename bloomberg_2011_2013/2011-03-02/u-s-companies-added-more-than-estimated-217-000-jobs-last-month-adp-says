Companies in the U.S. added more
workers in February than forecast, indicating the labor market
may be strengthening, data from a private report based on
payrolls showed today.  Employment increased by 217,000 last month after a revised
189,000 gain in January, according to figures from ADP Employer
Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey
called for a 180,000 gain last month.  Bigger, sustained payroll gains would underscore Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s testimony to Congress
yesterday that there are “grounds for optimism” about the
labor market in coming months. Companies added 200,000 jobs in
February, while unemployment rose to 9.1 percent, economists
project a Labor Department report to show in two days.  “There’s just an unambiguous signal that payroll
employment has picked up,”  Joel Prakken , chairman of
Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, which produces the figures with ADP,
said in a conference call with reporters. “Employment looks
like it’s increasing in almost every sector of the economy.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 34 economists ranged
from increases of 90,000 to 210,000.  Stock-index futures fell as crude  oil prices  increased. The
March contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.1
percent to 1,300.3 at 8:51 a.m. in  New York . Oil for April
delivery gained $1.52, to $101.15 a barrel in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Labor Department Figures  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figures were
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in November, when it overstated the gain in jobs by
43,000. The estimate was least accurate a month later, when it
overestimated the employment gain by 184,000.  The Labor Department said payrolls in January rose by
36,000 workers, the fewest in four months and depressed by
snowstorms that swept through parts of the nation during the
week covered by the government’s employer survey. ADP figures,
which measure the number of people on payroll processing rolls
regardless of whether they could show up for work, initially
showed companies added 187,000 workers during the month.  Today’s ADP report showed an increase of 15,000 workers in
goods-producing industries, which includes manufacturers and
construction companies. Employment at factories rose by 20,000
jobs.  Service providers added 202,000 workers, ADP said.  Size of Companies  Companies employing more than 499 workers expanded their
workforces by 13,000 jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to
499 employees, created 104,000 jobs and small companies
increased payrolls by 100,000, ADP said.    Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  were among U.S. companies
last month that announced plans to boost payrolls. A report
yesterday showed U.S. manufacturing grew in February at the
fastest pace in almost seven years, driven by gains in orders,
employment and exports that signal factories will continue to
propel the expansion.  “Overall, when we look at the job market we do believe
that it is on track to improve,”  Don Johnson , vice president of
U.S. sales for  General Motors Co. (GM) , said on a teleconference
yesterday. “February was quite simply another great month for
General Motors.”  GM said vehicle deliveries last month increased 46 percent
from February 2010.  Limited Hiring  Some businesses are concerned about limited hiring, even
after gross domestic product increased in 2010 by the most in
five years.  “The numbers coming out of the U.S. for GDP and industrial
production are pretty solid, but we have an issue with regard to
employment,” James Meil, chief economist at  Eaton Corp. (ETN)  said on
a Feb. 25 teleconference. The Cleveland-based maker of pumps
used in forklifts raised its full-year forecast amid higher
hydraulics sales.  The labor market “has improved only slowly” and it may
take “several years” for the  unemployment rate  to reach a
“more normal level, Bernanke said yesterday during testimony
before the Senate Banking Committee.  Still, “we do see some grounds for optimism about the job
market over the next few quarters, including notable declines in
the unemployment rate in December and January, a drop in new
claims for  unemployment insurance , and an improvement in firms’
hiring plans,” Bernanke said.  Employment Forecast  Overall payrolls, which include government workers,
probably rose by 193,000 in February, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed before the Labor Department’s
March 4 report.  President  Barack Obama  last week told the first meeting of
his panel of outside economic advisers that the U.S. must deal
with stubbornly high unemployment even as the recovery is well
under way.  The ADP report is based on data from about 340,000
businesses employing more than 21 million workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
