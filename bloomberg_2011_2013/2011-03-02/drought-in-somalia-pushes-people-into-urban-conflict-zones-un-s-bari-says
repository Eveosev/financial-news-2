Kenyan lawmaker Ephraim Maina plans
to present revised legislation to set a cap on the wholesale and
retail prices of corn, wheat, rice, cooking oil, sugar and
fuels, the Sunday Nation reported, citing Maina.  Price controls will help reign in the rising cost of
electricity and basic foods, items which are driving up
inflation in the east African nation, the Nairobi-based
newspaper reported today.  Kenyan President  Mwai Kibaki  last year rejected Maina’s
previous draft of the proposed law on price caps for essential
goods, saying if enacted it would violate World Trade
Organization rules, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
