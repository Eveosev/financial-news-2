  Iberdrola SA ,  Spain ’s biggest power
company, plans to invest 15.8 billion euros ($22 billion) over
the 2010-2012 period as it expands in  Brazil  and develops
projects including hydropower plants.  Investments in renewable energy and regulated business will
represent more than 80 percent of that total, Iberdrola said
today in a presentation. The company has completed 70 percent of
its planned divestments and is keeping its forecast for average
annual growth of 5 percent to 9 percent in earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and recurring
profit through 2012.  “Iberdrola faces the future with a capacity to invest in
the portfolio of businesses it has and to take advantage of new
opportunities,” Chief Executive Jose Ignacio Sanchez Galan said
in a presentation.  The Bilbao, Spain-based utility generates more than half
its power outside the country after expanding abroad to cut
reliance on the domestic market, where demand fell in 2009 and
regulators let it recoup only a portion of costs. Iberdrola
bought U.S. utility Energy East Corp. in 2008 and Scottish Power
Ltd. in 2007.  Share Performance  Iberdrola shares fell 1.6 percent to close at 6.13 euros in  Madrid  today, giving the company a market value of 34 billion
euros. Iberdrola last year had said that net investment from
2010 through 2012 may total 16 billion euros.  In January, the Spanish company agreed to buy Brazil’s
Elektro Eletricidade & Servicos SA for 1.77 billion euros,
gaining power distribution in an economy expanding at the
fastest pace in more than two decades. Net investment in 2011
will be about 3.8 billion euros, excluding Elektro, Iberdrola
said today.  Iberdrola said in a presentation in January that it intends
to propose integrating Elektro and Neoenergia SA, a Brazilian
company in which Iberdrola owns a 39 percent stake. Previ, the
pension fund of Banco do Brasil SA employees, owns 49 percent of
Neoenergia.  Last year, Iberdrola also increased its holding in Spanish
wind-turbine manufacturer Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA. It
sold a 2.7 percent stake in Portuguese utility EDP-Energias de
Portugal SA and a 15.7 percent holding in Petroceltic
International Plc.  The Spanish utility’s installed capacity totals 44,991
megawatts, of which natural gas-fired plants account for 29
percent, renewable energy 28 percent, hydropower 22 percent and
nuclear plants 7.4 percent.    Iberdrola Renovables SA , the company’s renewable-energy
unit, plans to add new capacity of 1,450 megawatts in 2011 and
750 megawatts in 2012. In the U.S., it will install new capacity
of 650 megawatts in 2011 and 350 megawatts in 2012. The unit
also said it’s aiming for free cash flow of more than 500
million euros in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
