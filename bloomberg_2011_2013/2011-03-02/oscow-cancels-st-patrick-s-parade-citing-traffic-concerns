Moscow cancelled its annual St.
Patrick’s parade as part of first-year Mayor  Sergei Sobyanin ’s
fight against traffic congestion.  The parade honoring Ireland’s patron saint, first held in
Moscow in 1992, will be replaced by an indoor concert on Sunday,
March 20, said Irish Ambassador to Russia Philip McDonagh.  “This event, of which the city of Moscow is joint patron,
replaces the parade -- an experiment we are trying this year in
view of the cold weather and the priority that is being given at
present to resolving Moscow’s traffic problems,” McDonagh said.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  cited street traffic as one of
the reasons he fired former Mayor Yuri Luzhkov in September
after two decades in power, replacing him with Sobyanin, who was
Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s then-chief of staff.  Moscow drivers suffer the longest traffic jams of 20 major
cities, with the average motorist spending at least 2 ½ hours
stuck in traffic at least once in the past three years,
according to an International Business Machines Corp. study
published in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
