President  Thomas Hoenig  said the central bank is “monetizing
debt” with its purchases of U.S. Treasuries, a program that he
says may spur inflation.  “Yes, we are monetizing debt,” Hoenig said today in a
speech in  New York . “You buy bonds and you monetize debt. Right
now, a lot of that is going into excess reserves so it is not
having an immediate effect on inflation. It will initiate
inflationary impulses. It takes time.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
