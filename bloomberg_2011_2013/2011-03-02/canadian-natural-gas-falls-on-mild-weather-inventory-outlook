Canadian natural gas for April
delivery fell on forecasts of mild weather in the eastern U.S.
and speculation that a U.S. government report will show a below-
normal withdrawal from inventories of the heating fuel.  Temperatures may be mostly normal in the eastern U.S. from
March 7 through March 11, according to Commodity Weather Group
in Bethesda,  Maryland . Heating demand in the Northeast may be 1
percent below normal from March 8 through March 12, according to
Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  The U.S. Energy Department may say inventories dipped 85
billion cubic feet in the week ended Feb. 25, according to the
median of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The five-
year average decline is 131 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
dropped 14.37 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $4.0309 per million
British thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance
is an express line that can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a
day to the Midwest from western  Canada .    Alberta  gas for April delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to C$3.22 per gigajoule ($3.15 per million Btu) as 4:36
p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. Northeast, Midwest and West Coast.  Natural gas for April delivery declined 5.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.818 per million Btu on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Alberta System  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, the biggest gas-
gathering network in the nation, was 15.8 billion cubic feet as
of 4:30 p.m. in New York. Volume on the system fell by 1 billion
in the past four hours.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 3.67 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.67 billion cubic feet.  Scheduled volume on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.69 billion cubic feet, 61 percent of
capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
