The U.S. government should cut its
spending and shrink its budget deficit to boost job growth and
investment, according to  David Malpass , founder and president of
the research firm Encima Global.  “To get jobs going in the U.S., you’ve got to bring money
back to the U.S., and right now capital is going to Asia,” New
York-based Malpass said in a Bloomberg Television interview on
“Surveillance Midday” with Tom Keene. “If the federal
government reduced spending, we would get more jobs.”  The  U.S. budget deficit  reached a record $1.3 trillion in
2010 and has swelled to 8.8 percent of the economy from 1
percent in 2007. The unemployment rate has remained at or above
9 percent since May 2009.  Structural reforms are important to contain the shortfall,
as investors are worried about whether the deficit will remain
this high in five years, Malpass said.  “If Congress would simply pass a law and the president
sign it, that would limit the debt-to-GDP ratio and investors
around the globe would flock to the U.S.,” Malpass said.  The Federal Reserve, which in November started a $600
billion program to buy  U.S. debt  in an effort to spur growth, is
“overreaching on its role,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
