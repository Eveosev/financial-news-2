Labor unions today said they would
mobilize against what they called an attack on regulatory
protections, urging President  Barack Obama  to pursue tighter
rules on companies instead.  “We must redouble our efforts to win new, stronger worker
protections and rights,” the AFL-CIO said in a statement after
two days of meetings in Washington on issues facing the  labor
movement . “The administration needs to move forward with much-
needed worker protection and not pull back in the face of
Republican and business opposition.”  Leaders of unions in the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest
labor federation, didn’t say how much money they would spend on
fighting for more regulations. AFL-CIO spokeswoman Alison Omens
said it was part of a broader campaign to push for  job creation .  Obama’s Labor Department this year shelved two proposals
for stricter workplace regulations, one that would have required
more extensive reporting of ergonomic-related workplace injuries
and one that would have tightened noise-reduction requirements.
In both cases, the administration cited business complaints.  Obama has ordered a review of regulations to remove or
overhaul those that limit economic expansion without benefitting
consumers.  “We must turn back the Republican-corporate attack on
regulations which, if successful, would leave businesses
unfettered and free to operate as they wish,” the AFL-CIO said
in their statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
