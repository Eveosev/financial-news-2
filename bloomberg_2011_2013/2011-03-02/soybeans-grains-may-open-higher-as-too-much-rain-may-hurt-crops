What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 12 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that too much rain
is falling in  Brazil , threatening to damage crops and slow
harvesting, said  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president for
the Linn Group in  Chicago . Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open 0.6 cent to 0.7 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal
futures may open up $3 to $4 per 2,000 pounds.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on speculation that rains in Brazil will
reduce the number of acres farmers are able to plant in the
seasonâ€™s secondary crop, Huckabay said. Wet, cold weather
expected in the Midwest over the next month also may delay U.S.
planting, he said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  on speculation that dry weather during the past four
months and drought conditions in the southern Great Plains will
reduce yields and the number of acres of U.S. winter wheat
harvested this year, Huckabay said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
