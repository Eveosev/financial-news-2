  Bank Zachodni WBK SA , the Polish
lender that  Banco Santander SA  agreed to buy last year, said
fourth-quarter profit increased 5 percent on higher interest
income.  Net income rose to 267.7 million zloty ($92.8 million) from
254.8 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank,  Poland ’s third-biggest by market value, said in a regulatory
statement today. That compares with the 225.4 million-zloty mean
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Zachodni
earned 974.2 million zloty in all of 2010.  Polish banks boosted their combined net income by 41
percent to 11.7 billion zloty last year, according to the
financial regulator. Earnings may continue rising as the
European Commission yesterday increased its forecast for 2011
economic growth to 4.1 percent.  Zachodni plans to keep its current strategy in place this
year as it seeks to become the regional hub for Santander, Chief
Executive Officer Mateusz Morawiecki told reporters in Warsaw
today. This includes increasing net income every year and
“organic growth,” he said.  The bank plans to pay 584.6 million zloty, or 8 zloty a
share, as a dividend from 2010 profit, it said today. It paid 4
zloty a share from 2009 net income.  Interest, Provisions  Net interest income, the difference between what the bank
pays on deposits and what it charges for loans, rose 16 percent
to 501.5 million zloty, while fees added 4.2 percent to 346.2
million zloty. Provisions for bad loans declined 2.8 percent.  The bank expects its loan portfolio to grow by 8 percent to
10 percent this year, Morawiecki said. Zachodni’s cost of risk,
the relation of provisions to total loans, may be below 121
basis points in 2011, Morawiecki said.  Zachodni aims to cut its cost to income ratio from 49.9
percent to 47 percent this year and 41 percent in 2013, thanks
mainly to higher revenue, the bank said.  Zachodni may gradually change its brand over the next years
to reflect the new ownership, the CEO said, adding that he
doesn’t expect changes to take place this year. Separately, he
said there are no plans to merge Zachodni with Santander’s other
Polish units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
