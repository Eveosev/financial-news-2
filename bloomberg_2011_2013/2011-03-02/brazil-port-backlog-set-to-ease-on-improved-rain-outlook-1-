Rains will ease this week in
Paranagua,  Brazil ’s second-largest port, allowing farmers to
ship grains such as soybeans and corn and clearing up a 19
kilometer-backlog, a government weather forecaster said.  Rains stopped today after five days of above-average
precipitation prevented trucks from unloading, Expedito Rebello,
head of research at the government‘s Meteorology Institute,
known as Inmet, said in a telephone interview from Brasilia.  About 800 trucks are waiting to unload at the port, down
from 1,000 trucks waiting yesterday, according to a port press
official, who declined to be named under company policy.  The port is expected to handle as much as a combined 28
million metric tons of corn, wheat, soybeans, soy meal and sugar
this year, up 20 percent from 2010 as farmers boost exports to
benefit from rising prices, Lourenco Fregonese, business
director at the port, said yesterday in a telephone interview.  Farmers sold 54 percent of the soybean crop they started
harvesting this month, compared with 30 percent in the year-
earlier period, the Celeres crop consulting firm said Feb. 28.  Soybean output in Brazil, the world’s second-biggest
grower, may rise to a record 70.1 million tons this year, from
68.7 million tons last year, the  Agriculture Ministry  said on
Feb. 9. Corn growers will harvest 54.5 million tons of the
grain, down from 56 million tons in 2010, the ministry said.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 14.25 cents, or 1
percent, to $13.8950 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at
12:38 p.m. New York time. The price reached a 30-month high of
$14.5575 on Feb. 9.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
