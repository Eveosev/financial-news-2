Tamil Nadu Newsprint and Papers Ltd.
is seeking to import 160,000 metric tons of non-coking coal
delivered in four shipments through a tender, according to a
document published on the company  website.   The Chennai-based state manufacturer is bidding for power
station coal of 6,000 kilocalories per kilogram, according to
the tender issued yesterday. Suppliers must submit offers by
March 23, it said.  The company typically imports about 550,000 tons of coal a
year, mainly from Indonesia, for its paper factory in Karur
district, India Coal Market Watch said in a note yesterday,
citing a company official. It bought 150,000 tons of the fuel
from  Indonesia  in November at a delivered price of $82 a ton.  The reference price set by Indonesia for coal grade of
6,200 kilocalories heating value was at a record $127.05 a ton
in February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
