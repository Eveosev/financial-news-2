Global investment in clean energy
and the carbon markets surged 30 percent last year from 2009
levels to a record $243 billion, according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance.  Investment in 2010 was the highest since the London-based
researcher began keeping records in 2004. The figures were
pooled from a database of financial transactions in clean energy
and the carbon markets, New Energy Finance said in a statement.  “Total worldwide new investment in clean energy surged
last year by over $50 billion into new record territory,”
Michael Liebreich, chief executive of New Energy Finance, said
today in the statement. “It was nearly five times higher than
when we first handed out the New Energy Finance League Table
Awards, six years ago.”  The research company named 13 organizations it considers
the leading investors and financial service providers in clean
energy and the carbon markets.  Among these, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, based in the U.S.,
scooped top investor by number of venture capital investment
rounds.  For mergers and acquisitions,  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA)  won top financial adviser to target companies, and  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  was the leading adviser to acquirer. The  European Investment Bank  was the biggest arrangers of project
finance, and Invesco Ltd.’s PowerShares Cleantech fund was the
best performing clean energy fund last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
