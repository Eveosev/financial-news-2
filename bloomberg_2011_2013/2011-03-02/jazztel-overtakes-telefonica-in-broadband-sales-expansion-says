  Jazztel Plc  overtook Telefonica SA
for the first time in signing new broadband internet customers
last year,  Expansion  reported, citing the Spanish
telecommunications regulator and the companies.  Jazztel gained 267,800 new broadband clients in 2010, or 34
percent of all new customers in Spain, compared with 246,000
signed by Telefonica, the newspaper said.  Jazztel benefited from more aggressive promotions as
consumption declines because of the economic crisis and people
looking for the cheapest price available, Expansion said.    Vodafone Group Plc  was third with 161,000 new broadband
customers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
