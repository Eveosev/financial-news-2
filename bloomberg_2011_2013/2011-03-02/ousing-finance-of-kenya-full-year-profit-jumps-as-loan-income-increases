Housing Finance Co.,  Kenya ’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, advanced to the highest in more
than four months after it said full-year profit surged as income
from loans increased.  The stock rose 50 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at 29.75
shilling by 3 p.m. in Nairobi, the highest since Oct. 27.  Net income jumped to 379.5 million shillings ($4.58
million) in the 12 months through December from 234.2 million
shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in a
statement e-mailed by the city’s stock exchange today. Net
interest income increased 22 percent to 1.15 billion shillings,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
