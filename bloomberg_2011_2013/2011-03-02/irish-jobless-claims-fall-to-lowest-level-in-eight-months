Irish jobless claims fell in
February to their lowest level in eight months, adding to signs
the economy is improving.  Seasonally adjusted claims fell by 1,700 from January to
439,200, the  Central Statistics Office  in Cork said in a report
on its website today. The  unemployment rate  was unchanged at
13.5 percent.  Enda Kenny, set to become Ireland’s next prime minister,
said Feb. 26 his “immediate priority” is creating jobs. His
Fine Gael party is in talks to form a coalition government with
Labour after Feb. 25 national elections. Unemployment has more
than doubled in the last two years as the economy shrank and
banks and builders cut jobs.  On an unadjusted basis, jobless claims rose by 1,622 to
444,299 in February, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
