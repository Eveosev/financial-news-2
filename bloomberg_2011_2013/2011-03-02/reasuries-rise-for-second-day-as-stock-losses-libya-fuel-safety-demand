Treasury yields were about one
basis point away from the lowest level in a month as declines in
Asian stocks and violence in  Libya  bolstered demand for the
relative safety of government debt.  Yields indicate investors are postponing bets on when the
Federal Reserve will raise borrowing costs. Rates on 30-day
federal funds futures contracts for delivery in January 2012
fell to 0.30 percent from this year’s high of 0.515 percent on
Feb. 8. The contract settles at the average overnight federal
funds rate for the delivery month, making it a gauge of trader
expectations for changes in borrowing costs.  “Tension in the Middle East is favorable for the U.S. bond
market,” said Hiroki Shimazu, an economist in Tokyo at Nikko
Cordial Securities Inc., a unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc., Japan’s third-largest publicly traded bank by assets.
“That will bring the yield down.”  The 10-year note yielded 3.39 percent as of 7:16 a.m. in  London , according to BGCantor Market Data. The 3.625 percent
security due in February 2021 traded at 101 30/32. The yield was
as low as 3.379 percent, the least since Feb. 1. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares declined 1.5 percent,
its first loss in four days. Libyan rebels prepared for battle
after repulsing attacks by forces loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi , as
the  United Nations  rebuked the regime.  Fed Buying  The Fed is scheduled to buy $5 billion to $7 billion of
Treasuries maturing from March 2015 to August 2016 today as part
of its plan to spur growth, according to its  website .  The April 2012 fed funds contract yields 0.51 percent,
indicating investors expect the Fed to increase borrowing costs
by then. Policy makers cut the target for the federal funds rate,
which banks charge each other on overnight loans, to a range of
zero to 0.25 percent in 2008.  Yields on two-year notes, among the  Treasury securities 
most sensitive to Fed rates because of their short maturities,
fell to a one-month low of 0.64 percent yesterday.  Investors earn an extra 88 basis points from same-maturity
securities in  Germany , the widest spread in two years.  Treasuries declined in early Asian trading as economists
said industry and government reports this week will show the
pace of U.S. employment growth is picking up from last year.  “The  U.S. economy  will keep growing at a moderate pace,”
said Tomohisa Fujiki, an interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas
Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. “Yields should be higher” as
it improves, he said.  U.S. Hiring  U.S. companies hired 180,000 workers last month, after
adding 187,000 in January, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of economists before today’s ADP Employer Services report. The
average of 183,500 for January and February compares with a
monthly average of 53,200 in 2010.  A Labor Department report on March 4 will show employers
added 193,000 jobs in February, up from 36,000 in January. The
figure compares with 35,000 job losses in February 2010. Home
Depot Inc., the world’s largest home improvement retailer, said
in February it’s hiring more than 60,000 temporary workers.  Yields will advance to 3.92 percent by year-end, according
to a Bloomberg survey of banks and securities companies with the
most recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings. BNP, one of
the 20 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed,
predicts 4.25 percent.    Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in  Washington 
yesterday a surge in oil and other commodity prices probably
won’t cause a permanent increase in broader inflation and
repeated that borrowing costs are likely to stay low.  Bernanke is scheduled to testify before the House Financial
Services Committee today, and the central bank plans to issue an
economic report known as the  Beige Book .  To contact the reporter on this story:
