  General Motors Co . Chief Executive
Officer Dan Akerson said the company’s “earnings momentum has
not slowed” and he views 2011 as “potentially higher” than
2010, the Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  Akerson said the company’s unprofitable European Opel and
Vauxhall unit was “on the road to recovery” and “seeing green
shoots,” although it was some way from sustainable
profitability, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
