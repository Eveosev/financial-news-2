TJX Companies Inc. put volume surged
to its highest level since December 2008 after two trades that
bet the retailer’s shares will decline by next month.  A block of 4,000 April $47 puts traded for 60 cents at 2:29
p.m. in  New York , the same time 2,000 April $50 puts changed
hands for $1.60, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The April $47
puts had an open interest of 99 before today, and the April $50
puts’ open interest was 129 before today.  More than 8,900 puts to sell the stock traded today, almost
20 times the four-week average and 3.3 times the number of calls
to buy. The most-active contracts were the April $47 puts, which
accounted for almost half of all put trades.  The Framingham, Massachusetts-based discount clothing
seller rose 1.7 percent to $50.47. TJX gained 23 percent in the
past year, compared with a 26 percent increase for a gauge of
companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that are dependent
on discretionary  consumer spending .  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
