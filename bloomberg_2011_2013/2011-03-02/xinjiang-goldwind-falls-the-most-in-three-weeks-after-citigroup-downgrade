Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co.,  China ’s biggest listed maker of wind turbines,
fell the most in three weeks in Shenzhen trading after Citigroup
Inc. recommended selling the Hong Kong-listed shares.  Xinjiang Goldwind slid 2.6 percent to 20.40 yuan at 1:45
p.m. in Shenzhen. The Hong Kong-traded shares plunged 4.1
percent to HK$12.78. Citigroup’s analysts cut the company’s
stock rating from “buy” and reduced their profit estimates for
fiscal 2010-12 on rising competition and overcapacity.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
