Cotton prices rose, extending a
rally above $2 a pound, on signs that global supplies will
remain limited this year amid increased demand from  China , the
world’s biggest consumer.  Orange juice  also gained.  Imports by China in January jumped 31 percent from a year
earlier after an 86 percent surge in 2010, government data show.
The price in New York more than doubled in the past 12 months,
reaching a record of $2.0893 on Feb. 18. The fiber jumped by the
exchange limit on ICE Futures U.S. for the fourth straight day
after dropping by the maximum in the previous four sessions.  “China seems to be still actively buying cotton,” said
Sid Love, the president of Joe Kropf & Sid Love Consulting
Services LLC in  Overland Park ,  Kansas . “This is a wild market
that none of us have ever witnessed.”  Cotton for May delivery rose by the limit of 7 cents, or
3.6 percent, to settle at $2.006 at 2:55 p.m. on ICE in  New
York . The price has jumped 13 percent since Feb. 24.  China’s output declined 6.3 percent last year. Inventories
in the U.S., the biggest exporter, have tumbled 68 percent in
the past year, ICE data show.  “Supplies are still extremely tight, and buyers have been
facing difficulty in securing raw cotton this season,” said Han Sung Min, a broker at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul.  Global cotton production will rise 11 percent to a record
in the year starting Aug. 1 after prices surged, the  International Cotton Advisory Committee  said yesterday.  “We will definitely see an increase in acreage, especially
in the U.S., and that should help prices come down,” Love of
Joe Kropf &  Sid Love  Consulting said.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery gained 1.05 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $1.763 in New York. The price has climbed 18
percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
