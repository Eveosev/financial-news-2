German two-year note yields were
within five basis points of the highest in 18 months as a report
showed euro-region producer prices rose faster than forecast,
stoking expectations for a rise in borrowing costs.  The five-year note yield rose as  Germany  sold 4.1 billion
euros ($5.7 billion) of the securities. Factory-gate prices in
the euro area jumped 6.1 percent from a year earlier, the
fastest pace since September 2008, after increasing 5.3 percent
in December, the European Union’s statistics office said.
Portugal sold 1 billion euros of six- and 12-month bills. The
European Central Bank is forecast to leave its benchmark
refinancing rate at a record low 1 percent tomorrow.  “The PPI data adds more pressure, especially to the front
end of the curve,” said  Huw Worthington , a fixed-income
strategist at  Barclays Capital  in London. “The main thing
driving yields up is higher interest-rate expectations, partly
on the view of inflation.”  Two-year note yields were one basis point higher at 1.54
percent as of 4:58 p.m. in  London . The 1.5 percent securities
due March 2013 fell 0.025, or 25 euro cents per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 99.92. They reached 1.59 percent on Feb. 23. Ten-year
bund yields were three basis points higher at 3.20 percent,
after falling as much as four basis points. The five-year yield
gained two basis points to 2.42 percent.  Barclays Capital forecasts the so-called schatz yield will
climb to 2.3 percent by the end of this year as the ECB
increases its main refinancing rate by 50 basis points, or 0.5
percentage points.  Consumer-price inflation in the 17-nation euro area
accelerated to 2.4 percent in February and ECB officials
including Juergen Stark have signaled they are ready to raise
borrowing costs from a record low if needed.  German Auction  Forward contracts on the euro overnight index average, or
Eonia, show investors are betting the  European Central Bank  will
raise its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points at its
September meeting, according to Deutsche Bank AG data.    Spain  plans to sell bonds maturing in 2014 and 2016
tomorrow, while France will sell securities maturing in 2017,
2018, 2020 and 2026.  The German government sold 4.138 billion euros of 2 percent
five-year notes at an average yield of 2.39 percent, compared
with 2.49 percent at the previous auction of the securities on
Feb. 9. Germany’s debt agency, DFA, retained 862.5 million euros
of the issue.  Investors bid for 1.9 times the amount of securities on
offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover of 1.8 times at
the previous sale.  The “bid-to-cover ratio was pretty good, also the retained
amount is the lower range of what the DFA usually retains,”
said Norbert Aul, an interest-rates strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in London. “Overall a pretty good auction.”  Portuguese Bailout    Portugal  sold 550 million euros of six-month bills and 450
million euros of 12-month bills today. The securities due in
September were issued at an average yield of 2.984 percent, the
Treasury said today. That’s the same yield as at the previous
auction of bills with the same maturity on Feb. 2.  The auction attracted bids for 2.6 times the amount
offered, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 4.8 in February.  The bills due in February 2012 were issued at an average
yield of 4.057 percent. That compares with a yield of 3.987
percent at the previous auction on Feb. 16. Bidders sought 3.1
times the amount offered, compared with the previous bid-to-
cover ratio of 1.9. The Portuguese debt agency also said it
bought back 90 million euros of bonds due in April and 20
million euros of bonds due in June.  Portugal will accept a financial bailout “within the next
few weeks” as the cost of issuing debt becomes unsustainable,
said Axa Investment Managers, which oversees $714 billion in
assets.  ‘Too High’  “The borrowing costs are just too high” for Portugal,
Christopher Iggo, London-based chief investment officer for
fixed income at Axa,  France ’s fourth-largest fund manager, said
in a telephone interview two days ago.  Portugal’s 10-year bond yield reached 7.64 percent on
Feb. 10, the most since the inception of the euro in 1999, and
was at 7.48 percent today. It first climbed above 7 percent on
Nov. 10 and has been above that level since Feb. 4.  Greek 10-year yields rose four basis points to 12.08
percent, the highest since Nov. 11.  German  government bonds  handed investors a loss of 1.3
percent this year, compared with 3.2 percent for Portugal and
0.1 percent for  U.S. Treasuries , according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
