Government cuts to education will
stifle student growth at U.K. universities for the next five
years, according to  Unite Group Plc , the country’s largest
provider of student accommodation.  “Our five-year view is that student numbers will be
flat,” Unite Chief Executive Officer Mark Allan said in an
interview today. “If you took away the cap on funding and
constraints on universities, there would be a lot more students
going.”  Spending for higher education, excluding research, will
fall by 40 percent to 4.2 billion pounds ($6.9 billion) by the
academic year ending in 2015, according to the Department of
Business, Innovation and Skills. The number of accepted
applicants for places at U.K. universities has risen every year
since 2006, reaching 487,329 in 2010, according to  UCAS , which
manages applications for university courses.  Unite’s full-year net income was 19.6 million pounds,
compared with a loss of 34.9 million pounds a year earlier, the
Bristol, England-based company said today in a statement.  Though overall student numbers won’t increase, a shortage
of accommodation and a lack of new developments will continue to
underpin rental growth, Unite said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
