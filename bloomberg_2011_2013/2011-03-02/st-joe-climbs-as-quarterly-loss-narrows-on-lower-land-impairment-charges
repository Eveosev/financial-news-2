St. Joe Co., the  Florida  landholder
that announced a management shakeup this week after its largest
shareholder complained about wasteful spending, reported a
narrower loss as it reduced charges for stalled projects.  The net loss was $2.7 million, or 3 cents a share, for the
quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $58.7 million, or
64 cents, a year earlier, the Watersound, Florida-based company
said in a statement yesterday. Pretax charges, which include
impairment costs, fell to $10.7 million from $84 million.  St. Joe has recorded 11 straight quarterly losses after
Florida’s real estate crash drove down property values. Revenue,
which comes mostly from real estate sales, was unchanged in the
fourth quarter at $37.1 million. That beat the estimate of
Sheila McGrath, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. in  New
York , who projected $15.5 million.  The quarter had “a meaningful pick-up in residential
activity,” McGrath wrote in a note to clients today. “This
report, with liquidity preserved and residential pick-up, should
be met with some relief.”  Revenue included $17.1 million for transfer of the title
from a 2006 sale of land to the Florida Department of
Transportation.  The company’s shares rose $1.07, or 4.3 percent, to $26.25
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock lost 9 percent in the previous two days after Chief
Executive Officer Britt Greene and three directors resigned amid
a clash with shareholder  Bruce Berkowitz .  New Board  Berkowitz, whose Fairholme Capital Management LLC owns
about 29 percent of  St. Joe , had sought to oust the board after
criticizing the company for its spending and corporate
governance. He will become a director, along with Fairholme
president Charles M. Fernandez, former Florida Governor  Charlie
Crist  and Carnival Corp. Chief Operating Officer Howard Frank.  St. Joe plans to hire an executive search firm to find
Greene’s replacement.  Greene’s severance package includes more than $4.3 million
in cash and benefits plus 128,681 shares of stock and six years
insurance coverage for potential lawsuits, the company said in a
regulatory filing yesterday. He earned $2.8 million in 2009,
when the company reported a loss of $130 million on revenue of
$138 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company said yesterday that it will delay filing its
annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Companies with a market value of more than $700 million are
required to file an annual report within 60 days of the fiscal
year end, which for St. Joe was Dec. 31.  Originally a timber and paper company, St. Joe transitioned
in the 1990s to a housing and resort developer, The company owns
574,000 acres (232,300 hectares) in northern Florida, about 70
percent of which is within 15 miles (24 kilometers) off the
coast of the  Gulf of Mexico .  To contact the reporter on this story:
