  Zambia â€™s government has ordered its
Food Reserve Agency to cut the amount it charges millers for
corn by 20 percent to $160 a metric ton to reduce the price of
corn meal, a staple food in the country.  Export prices for corn will remain at $200 a ton, Ronnie
Shikapwasha, the government spokesman, told reporters in Lusaka,
the capital, today.  Zambia had a record 2.8 million ton corn crop in the season
just ended, adding to stocks of 298,682 tons that it already
had.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
