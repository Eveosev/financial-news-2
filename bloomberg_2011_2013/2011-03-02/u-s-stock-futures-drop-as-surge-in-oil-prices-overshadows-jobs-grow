U.S. stock-index futures retreated,
signaling the market may decline for a second day, as a surge in
energy prices overshadowed a private report showing better-than-
estimated growth in payrolls.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring this
month lost 0.2 percent to 1,298.70 at 8:27 a.m. in  New York . Dow
Jones Industrial Average futures declined 17 points, or 0.1
percent, to 12,005. Crude oil rallied as much as 1.6 percent to
$101.19 a barrel.  The  S&P 500  posted its first drop in three days yesterday
as concern that rising energy costs will hurt the economic
recovery overshadowed the fastest manufacturing growth since
2004. The gauge slid 1.7 percent last week as anti-government
uprisings in Libya pushed  oil prices  higher.   Still, the S&P 500 has rallied 25 percent since the end of
August as reports showed an improving economy, the  Federal
Reserve  purchased Treasuries to suppress  interest rates  and
earnings beat analysts’ estimates for the eighth straight
quarter.    Employment increased by 217,000 last month after a revised
189,000 gain in January, according to figures from ADP Employer
Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey
called for a 180,000 gain last month.  The ADP report comes two days before the Labor Department’s
February jobs data, which economists said may show payrolls grew
by 193,000 workers, the most since May 2010, after a 36,000 gain
in January. The release may also show the jobless rate rose to
9.1 percent in February from 9 percent in January.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
