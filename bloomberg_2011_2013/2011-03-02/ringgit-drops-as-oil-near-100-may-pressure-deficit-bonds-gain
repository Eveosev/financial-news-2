Malaysia’s ringgit snapped a three-
day gain on concern a surge in crude  oil prices  will crimp
economic growth and hurt the government’s efforts to trim its  budget deficit .  The currency dropped the most in almost a week after oil
climbed above $100 a barrel amid escalating political tensions
in the Middle East. Malaysia increased fuel and sugar prices
twice in 2010 in an effort to claw back 73 billion ringgit ($24
billion) in annual state subsidies.  Government bonds  advanced.  “Higher oil prices are negative for growth and this
affects sentiment in the market,” said Ahmad Zubaidi Samse, a
currency trader at Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
Raising fuel prices or cutting subsidies “will also be harder
and unpopular now,” he said.  The ringgit declined 0.3 percent to 3.0385 per dollar as of
4:17 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It strengthened 0.6 percent yesterday, the most since
Dec. 24.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares slid 1.4
percent, the most since Feb. 22. Oil reached $103.41 on Feb. 24
in  New York , the highest level since Sept. 29, 2008. Crude has
risen 9 percent this year and was recently at $99.47 a barrel as
an uprising in  Libya , holder of Africa’s largest oil reserves,
intensified concern that supply will be disrupted.  Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak aims to narrow the
budget deficit to 2.8 percent of gross domestic product by 2015,
from an estimated 5.6 percent in 2010, according to the finance
ministry’s forecasts.  Bonds Rise  Three-year notes gained for a second day on speculation the
risk of slowing growth will prevent the central bank from
raising  interest rates  at its policy meeting this month.  The yield on the 3.434 percent note due August 2014 fell 2
basis points, or 0.02 percentage points, to 3.37 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia. The price increased 0.05, or 50 sen
per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 100.2.  Bank Negara has kept its overnight rate at 2.75 percent in
the past three straight meetings, after lifting it three times
between March and July last year. Policy makers next meet on
March 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
