European stocks dropped for a second
day amid concern that rising energy costs following revolts in
the Middle East and North Africa will hurt the global economy.    Daimler AG (DAI)  led automobile shares lower.  Swiss Life Holding
AG (SLHN)  sank 4.3 percent after  Switzerland ’s biggest life insurer
reported operating profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  Celesio AG (CLS1)  plunged 6.4 percent as  DZ Bank  AG recommended selling
the drug wholesaler’s shares.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index retreated 0.3 percent to 283.77
at 3:42 p.m. in  London . The measure has declined 2.6 percent
since peaking at a 2 1/2-year high on Feb. 17, trimming this
year’s advance to 2.9 percent, as opponents of  Libya ’s ruler
Muammar Qaddafi took over large parts of the country, sending
the price of oil soaring.  “The news flow from the Middle East increases the  risk
premium ,” said Lars Schickentanz, chief investment officer at
Prima Sgr in Milan. “The market will consolidate if no further
oil spike occurs, and correct if oil spikes further. Macro data
are good, but will weaken going forward.”  Crude for April delivery gained as much as 1.9 percent to
$101.47 a barrel in electronic trading in  New York  as Libyan
rebels braced for renewed attacks by Qaddafi loyalists and
reports showed Iranian protesters clashed with security forces
in  Iran , the second-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Producer Prices  In Europe, producer-price inflation accelerated more than
economists forecast in January as soaring energy costs added to
the  European Central Bank ’s concerns that inflationary pressures
are building. The ECB is due to meet tomorrow to make its
monthly decision on  interest rates .  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protecting
against a decline in shares on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, climbed
2.1 percent to 24.31, after surging 4.9 percent yesterday.  Stocks declined even after a private report showed
companies in the U.S. added more workers in February than
forecast, indicating that the labor market may be strengthening.
Employment increased by 217,000 last month after a revised
189,000 gain in January, according to figures from ADP Employer
Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey
called for a 180,000 gain last month.  The report comes two days before the Labor Department’s
February jobs data, which economists said may show payrolls grew
by 193,000 workers, the most since May 2010, after a 36,000 gain
in January.  National benchmark indexes retreated in all but four of the
18 western European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index
added 0.1 percent, while  Germany ’s DAX Index and  France ’s CAC 40
Index declined 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively.  Auto Shares  Carmakers dropped as the shares of companies whose earnings
are most tied to economic growth retreated. Daimler, the world’s
second-biggest maker of luxury cars, fell 2.5 percent to 49.76
euros.  Swiss Life fell 4.3 percent to 145.80 Swiss francs after
the company said profit from operations rose 23 percent to 694
million francs ($753.4 million) last year. That missed the 797
million-franc average estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Celesio slumped 6.4 percent to 18.47 euros, the largest
drop on the Stoxx 600, as DZ Bank cut its rating on the shares
to “sell” from “buy,” citing a “cloudy” outlook for 2011.  Essilor International SA dropped 2.3 percent to 51.45 euros
even after the world’s largest maker of lenses for glasses said
it’s targeting sales growth of 6 percent to 8 percent in 2011.
Cheuvreux SA cut its rating to “underperform” from
“outperform,” saying that while results were solid, the upside
is limited.  Neopost, Verbund    Neopost SA (NEO)  dropped 4.6 percent to 66.18 euros. Europe’s
biggest maker of mailroom equipment said fourth-quarter sales
rose 8.6 percent to 261.1 million euros.    Verbund AG (VER)  sank 6.1 percent to 26.14 euros as  Austria ’s
biggest utility said 2010 profit fell to 400.8 million euros
from 644.4 million euros in 2009. Analysts had forecast a profit
of 432 million euros, according to the median of nine estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.    Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  increased 4.1 percent to 1,683.5
pence after saying profit rose 28 percent to a record $4.33
billion last year as its costs for bad loans fell. The lender
predicted “double-digit” income growth for 2011 even as a U.K.
bank levy weighs on earnings.    ITV Plc (ITV)  surged 8.8 percent to 93 pence, the biggest jump
since 2009. The U.K.’s biggest free-to-air commercial
broadcaster said profit almost tripled last year on a rebound in  television advertising  and as the company cut costs.    Bouygues SA (EN)  advanced 3.2 percent to 34.26 euros. The French
construction, television and telecommunications company said
sales will increase by 2 percent in 2011, after posting earnings
for 2010 that beat analyst estimates.    Arkema SA (AKE)  surged 7.1 percent to 57.32 euros as the maker of
acrylics said that it will meet its 2015 objectives. The company
reported 2010 net income of 347 million euros, compared with the
average analyst estimate of 313 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
