Abdul Hakim Abdel Nasser, the
youngest son of former Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, is
prepared to lead his country if this is what its citizens
desire,  Germany ’s  Bunte  magazine reported, citing an interview.  Abdel Nasser, 55, a construction developer, said his father
stood for the same principles of freedom, social justice, equal
opportunities and prosperity as Egyptians who toppled former
president  Hosni Mubarak , according to the magazine.  “If the people want another Nasser, I will serve Egypt,”
he is cited as saying in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
