Syncrude Canada Ltd. cut 200,000
barrels from its estimated March production forecast, according
to a person with knowledge of the situation.  Syncrude expects to produce 9.5 million barrels in March,
or about 306,500 barrels a day, said the person, who declined to
be identified because the information isn’t public.  “We only comment only on material changes to production,”
said Siren Fisekci, a Calgary-based spokeswoman for Canadian Oil
Sands Ltd., one of the seven companies that have a stake in
Syncrude.  During the 28 days of February Syncrude produced 9.4
million barrels of crude oil, or about 336,100 barrels a day, to
the company’s  website .  In January, Syncrude produced 9.9 million barrels, or
319,300 barrels of oil a day, according to the company’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
