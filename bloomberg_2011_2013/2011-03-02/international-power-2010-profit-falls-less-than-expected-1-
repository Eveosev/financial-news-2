  International Power Plc , the U.K.-
based utility controlled by  GDF Suez  SA, said 2010 operating
profit fell less than expected on declining power sales in
Britain and  North America .  Profit from operations dropped to 995 million pounds ($1.62
billion) from a restated 1.03 billion pounds a year earlier, the
London-based company said in a statement today. Analysts had
expected operating profit of 934.5 million pounds, according to
the median estimate of seven analysts. The company will pay a
full-year dividend 10.91 pence a share.  GDF, operator of Europe’s largest natural-gas network,
agreed to buy International Power in August, creating an
electricity producer worth $30 billion with plants from Brazil
to Australia.  The enlarged entity combined GDF’s unit outside  Europe  and
assets in the U.K. and Turkey with those of International Power.
GDF owns about 70 percent of the London-listed company, which
has a gross generation capacity of about 70,200 megawatts,
according to today’s statement.  “The new management team has already made significant
progress in integrating the two businesses,” International
Power Chairman Dirk Beeuwsaert said in the statement. “Our
balance sheet is strong and we are well positioned for growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
