Harbinger Capital Partners and Solus
Alternative Asset Management have offered to acquire bankrupt
satellite company DBSD North America Inc., which has a deal to
sell itself to  Dish Network Corp .  The offer from Harbinger and Solus is “superior” to
Dish’s $1 billion deal for the company, the investment firms
said in a copy of a Feb. 28 letter sent to DBSD and filed with
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan yesterday.  The proposal “provides a greater cash component to holders
of claims against the debtors and permits certain of such
creditors the option to participate in the equity of the
reorganized company if they so choose,” Stephen Blauner, a
managing director at Solus, said in a court filing.  DBSD, based in Reston,  Virginia , is scheduled to seek court
approval today for its investment agreement with Dish, a
satellite-television provider. DBSD decided to proceed with the
Dish deal after considering the Harbinger-Solus offer, Blauner
said in his court filing.  Harbinger and Solus said in their letter that they may
combine DBSD with TerreStar Networks Inc., another satellite
company that is also in bankruptcy.  Ryan Bennett, a lawyer for DBSD, didn’t immediately return
an e-mail seeking comment after normal working hours.  The case is In re: DBSD North America Inc., 09-13061,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story: David McLaughlin in
