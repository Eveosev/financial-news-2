  Qantas Airways Ltd ., forced to
ground Airbus SAS A380s after a mid-air engine explosion in
November, reported a second loss of oil from superjumbo turbines
in less than two weeks.  Pilots idled a  Rolls-Royce Group Plc  engine on an A380
flying from Singapore to  London  on Feb. 24, according to a
 notice  posted on the website of the Australian Transport Safety
Bureau today. A Feb. 15 flight on the same route suffered a
similar incident, according to an earlier  note . There were no
injuries or damage to the aircraft in either case.  Qantas said both leaks last month affected different parts
of the engine than those involved in the November explosion that
forced an emergency landing in  Singapore . The blowup prompted
the Sydney-based airline to pull its superjumbos out of service
for 23 days as it carried out inspections.  The airline has raised the issue with Rolls-Royce and is
awaiting feedback, it said in an e-mailed reply to Bloomberg
News questions. The engine maker is working with Qantas, David
Mair, a spokesman for London-based Rolls-Royce, said by phone.  The airline fell 2.1 percent to A$2.28 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of trading in Sydney today. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200
Index dropped 0.5 percent.  Five of the six A380s that were grounded are back in
service, Qantas said last month. Itâ€™s adding four in the fiscal
year ending June 30 as Airbus works through orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
