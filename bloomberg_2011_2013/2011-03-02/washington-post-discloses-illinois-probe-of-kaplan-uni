  Washington Post Co. (WPO) ’s Kaplan Higher
Education Corp. received a civil investigative demand from the
Illinois attorney general’s office, the company said in a U.S.
regulatory filing.  Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s demand, received
by the company on Feb. 7, “primarily” seeks information about
Kaplan University online students who are Illinois residents,
Washington Post told the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Kaplan Higher Education is reviewing the demand and
“intends to cooperate with the inquiry,” according to an
annual report the Washington-based news company filed with the
SEC today.  U.S. Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, has led a
federal probe into the business practices of Kaplan and other
for-profit educational companies, including those run by the
Phoenix-based  Apollo Group Inc. (APOL)   Robyn Ziegler, a spokeswoman for Madigan, said she couldn’t
immediately comment on the Washington Post report.    Bridgepoint Education Inc. (BPI) , a San Diego-based for-profit
schooling company, on Feb. 15 announced its Ashford University
unit in Clinton, Iowa, was being investigated by state Attorney
General Tom Miller.  To contact the reporter on this story:
