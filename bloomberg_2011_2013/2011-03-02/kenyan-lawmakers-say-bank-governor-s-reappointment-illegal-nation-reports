Kenyan lawmakers said the re-
appointment of  Central Bank  Governor Njuguna Ndung’u was illegal
because there was no review of his performance and regular
hiring procedures were flouted, the  Daily Nation  said.  The  Central Bank of Kenya’s  board hadn’t met to discuss the
best qualified person to fill the position, the Nairobi-based
newspaper reported today, citing legislators including Charles
Kilonzo and Millie Odhiambo.  Kenyan President  Mwai Kibaki  last week reappointed Ndung’u
for a second, four year term, beginning on March 4.  The president has the authority to re-appoint the bank’s
head, according to the  Central Bank of Kenya Act , the newspaper
cited  Kenya ’s Assistant Finance Minister Oburu Odinga as saying.
New members to the central bank’s board will be chosen this
week, Odinga said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
