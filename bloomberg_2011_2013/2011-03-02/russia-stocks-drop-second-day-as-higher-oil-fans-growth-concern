Russian stocks fell for the second
day on concern oil prices will slow the global economic
recovery, curbing demand for metals.  The 30-stock  Micex Index  fell 0.5 percent to 1,749.81 by
11:55 a.m. in Moscow. OAO Novolipetsk Steel, Russian billionaire
Vladimir Lisin’s steelmaker, declined 2.2 percent. OAO GMK
Norilsk Nickel, the world’s biggest nickel producer, fell as
much as 1.3 percent. OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank,
retreated 0.6 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS gained 0.1
percent to 1,965.05.  Oil for April delivery gained as much as 1 percent to
$100.64 a barrel in electronic trading in  New York  as Libyan
rebels braced for renewed attacks by forces loyal to leader  Muammar Qaddafi . Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index yesterday
plunged the most since November 2008 on concern regional unrest
would extend to the kingdom, and Iranian protesters clashed with
security forces in Tehran, Al Arabiya television reported.
Copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc all fell in London trading.  “The specific concern is that rising oil costs threaten to
push inflation higher and to cut the growth momentum in
developed markets,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib
Financial Corp., wrote in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
