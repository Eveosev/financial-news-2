  South Korea ’s industrial production
grew at the fastest pace in five months as overseas demand for
the country’s cars and electronics drives growth in Asia’s
fourth-largest economy.  Output increased 13.7 percent in January from a year
earlier, Statistics  Korea  said in Gwacheon today, from a revised
10.6 percent in December. The median estimate of 12 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 12.4 percent gain.
Production gained 4.6 percent from December.  Stocks and the won rose after the report, which bolstered
economists’ expectations that Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo will raise the key interest rate next week from 2.75 percent.
At the same time, central bank officials will need to consider
whether surging  oil prices  may threaten growth by undermining
the global economy and demand for exports.  “Strong output data suggests the economy is sustaining
stable growth,” said June Park, an economist at Woori
Investment & Securities Co. in  Seoul . “Inflation pressures are
mounting such that the central bank should raise interest rates
soon.”  The won rose 0.4 percent to 1,123.75 per dollar as of 10:15
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,122.68, the strongest level since Feb. 23. The  Kospi
index (KOSPI)  climbed 1.4 percent to 1,954.21.  Breaching Target  Consumer prices climbed 4.5 percent in February from a year
earlier, after gaining 4.1 percent in January, breaching the
central bank’s target of between 2 percent to 4 percent on
average through 2012. The monetary authority predicts inflation
will accelerate to 3.5 percent this year from 2.9 percent in
2010.  “The BOK is well behind the curve and should have hiked
rates last month to anchor rising inflation expectations,” Kwon Young Sun, an economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in  Hong Kong ,
said before the report. “Now the decision gets tougher as the
world economy could face a double-dip economy if oil prices keep
rising due to the Middle East unrest.”  Exports rose 17.9 percent in February from a year earlier,
after climbing 45.4 percent in January, the most in a year.
Overseas shipments account for about the half the economy and
boosted earnings last year at companies including Samsung
Electronics Co., the world’s second-largest maker of mobile
phones.  Economic Growth  South Korea’s economy expanded 0.5 percent in the three
months through December from the previous quarter, when it grew
0.7 percent. For the whole of 2010, gross domestic product
increased 6.1 percent, the fastest pace since 2002. The  Bank of
Korea  forecasts 4.5 percent economic expansion in 2011.  A leading index of economic indicators, which forecasts
business activity, rose 3 percent in January from a year earlier,
compared with a revised 2.8 percent gain in December, today’s
report showed.  Sales of  consumer goods  rose 4.3 percent in January from
December and advanced 10.8 percent from a year earlier.
Investment in factories increased 22.3 percent from a year
earlier.  Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo raised the benchmark
interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in July,
November and January from a record-low 2 percent, joining
counterparts from China and  India  in tightening monetary policy
to fight inflation as  Asia  leads the global recovery.  To contact the reporters on this story:
