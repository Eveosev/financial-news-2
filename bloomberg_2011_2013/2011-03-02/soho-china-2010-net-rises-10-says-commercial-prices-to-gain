  Soho China Ltd ., the biggest
developer in Beijing’s central business district, said 2010
profit rose 10 percent and forecast a “significant” gain in
commercial property prices.  Net income climbed to 3.6 billion yuan ($547 million), or
0.67 yuan a share, from 3.3 billion yuan or 0.63 yuan a year
earlier, it said in a Hong Kong exchange statement, exceeding
the 3.4 billion yuan average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales more than doubled to 18.2 billion from 7.4
billion, boosted by office and retail developments including the
Galaxy Soho and Soho Nexus Centre in Beijing.  Soho expects offices and malls to draw more investors as
the government introduces curbs aimed at home purchases.
Commercial real estate investment in the world’s fastest-growing
major economy jumped 42 percent last year from 2009, while
transaction volume rose 20 percent, according to Cushman &
Wakefield Inc., the world’s largest closely held real estate
services company.  “The commercial  property market  remains nearly unaffected
by the policies and may become the only property investment
vehicle that attracts tremendous investment,” Pan Shiyi, Soho’s
chairman, said in an e-mailed statement. “We expect to see a
significant increase in commercial property price.”  The developer will also seek acquisitions “more
aggressively” in 2011, it said, adding it has about 18 billion
yuan in cash.  Housing Curbs    China  has this year raised the minimum down payment for
second-home purchases and introduced taxes on residential
properties in Shanghai and Chongqing. Chinese cities including
the Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou also announced restrictions
on home purchases last month, responding to measures imposed by
the central government. In October, the central bank raised  interest rates  for the first time in three years.  Soho said most of the government’s measures were within
expectations, except for the policies restricting home purchases
and setting price ceilings on homes, which will take way
“almost all investment demand for residential projects.”  Soho fell 0.5 percent to HK$5.65 at the 4 p.m. close in
Hong Kong, bringing the stock’s losses this year to 2.3 percent,
compared with the  Hang Seng Index ’s 0.1 percent retreat. Its
drop today compared with a 1.5 percent slide in the benchmark
index and a 2.2 percent slide in a gauge of developers listed in
Hong Kong.  --Bonnie Cao, with assistance from Stanley James in  Hong Kong .
