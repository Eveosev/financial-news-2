The cost of protecting corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
increased, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 4 basis points
to 107.5 as of 11:22 a.m. in Sydney, according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan added 3.5 basis points to 110 basis
points as of 8:22 a.m. in  Singapore , Citigroup prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1 basis point to 102.5
as of 9:22 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup prices show. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
debt against default and traders use them to speculate on credit
quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement. The swaps pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the securities if a borrower
fails to meet its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
