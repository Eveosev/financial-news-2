Oil dropped from the highest close
in 30 months in  New York  before an Energy Department report that
may show U.S. crude stockpiles increased last week.  Oil for April delivery dropped as much as 42 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $99.21 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $99.26 at 4:11 p.m. in
Singapore. Yesterday, the contract rose 2.7 percent to $99.63,
the highest close since September 2008.  An Energy Department report today may show inventories rose
750,000 barrels last week from 346.7 million barrels, according
to the median of 17 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. It would be the seventh week of gains. Data from the
industry-funded American Petroleum Industry yesterday showed
supplies fell 1.1 million barrels last week.  Oil rose as much as 1 percent to $100.64 a barrel earlier
today as protests in  Iran  stoked concern the turmoil spreading
across the Middle East may disrupt supplies from OPECâ€™s second-
largest producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
