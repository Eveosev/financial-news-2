The U.S.  Veterans Affairs Department 
is requesting $3.16 billion for information technology in fiscal
2012, a decrease from its $3.3 billion request the previous
year, Secretary Eric Shinseki said today.  Shinseki told the U.S. Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee
that the department made a “sound business decision” last year
to shutdown technology programs related to a financial
accounting system and a data warehouse. The shuttered projects
are part of the reason for the 4.2 percent decrease in the
proposed IT budget.  The agency would continue to focus on key technology
priorities, including a paperless claims system that is
scheduled to go online nationally in May 2012, Shinseki said.  Information technology “is not a supplementary function,”
Shinseki said in his prepared statement. “It is key to the
delivery of efficient, modern health care.”  President  Barack Obama  requested an overall fiscal 2012
technology budget of $79.5 billion, up from a projected $78.5
billion for fiscal 2011, according to the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
