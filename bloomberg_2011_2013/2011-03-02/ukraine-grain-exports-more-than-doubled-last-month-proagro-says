Ukraineâ€™s exports of wheat, barley
and corn were 605,700 metric tons in February, compared with
251,000 tons a month earlier, ProAgro said, citing information
from ports.  Wheat shipments reached 154,200 tons, the Kiev-based
researcher said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday, with
most of the crop going to Turkey and  Israel .  Barley exports were 54,800 tons, ProAgro said, with Libya
and Israel the main buyers. Corn shipments almost doubled to
396,700 tons and Israel, Iran and  Spain  were among the biggest
buyers, according to the statement.  Ukraine, which limited grain shipments to 4.2 million tons
from October through the end of March, may expand wheat and corn
export quotas, Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said on
Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
