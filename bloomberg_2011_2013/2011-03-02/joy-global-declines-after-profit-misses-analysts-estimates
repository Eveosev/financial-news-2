  Joy Global Inc ., the maker of P&H
and Joy mining equipment, fell in New York trading after posting
first-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates as flooding
in  Australia  cut sales.  Net income rose 34 percent to $102.2 million, or 96 cents a
share, in the three months ended Jan. 28, from $76.2 million, or
73 cents, a year earlier, the Milwaukee-based company said today
in a statement. That trailed the $1.07 average estimate of 18
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Australian floods in January
reduced sales and operating income by $24 million and $8 million
respectively, the company said.  “The miss was driven by lower-than-expected revenues and
operating margins in both underground and surface segments,”
Ann Duignan, a New York-based analyst for JPMorgan Chase & Co.
who rates the shares “neutral,” said in a report. “Following
Bucyrus’ results, expectations were high and investors will
likely be disappointed.”  Bucyrus International Inc., a South Milwaukee-based rival
to Joy, on Feb. 17 reported fourth-quarter profit that beat the
average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Mining
companies are increasing  capital expenditures  to keep up with
demand from emerging markets for commodities such as copper.  Joy fell $2.68, or 2.8 percent, to $94.32 as of 4:29 p.m.
in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The shares have gained
8.7 percent this year.  The company forecast fiscal 2011 earnings of $5.10 to $5.40
a share. That compares with a December projection for profit of
$5 to $5.30 a share.  Sales increased 19 percent to $869.5 million from $729.2
million in the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
