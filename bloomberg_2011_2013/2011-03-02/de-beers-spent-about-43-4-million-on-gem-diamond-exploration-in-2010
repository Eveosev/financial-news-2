  De Beers , producer of more than a
third of the world’s rough diamonds, said it invested $43.4
million on exploration for gems last year.  De Beers, which spent $44.8 million on exploration in 2009,
last year discovered 22  kimberlite pipes , geological formations
containing diamonds, adding to the company’s previous 195, it
said in a 2010 operating and financial  review  on its website.  The company, 45 percent owned by  Anglo American Plc , said
last month it may boost its annual rate of output 21 percent to
38 million carats this year and 40 million next after producing
33 million in 2010.  ZAO Alrosa , the state-owned Russian diamond
monopoly that is De Beers’ biggest rival, spent $92 million on
geological exploration last year, up from $32 million in 2009.  De Beers reported record 2010 earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization of $1.4 billion after a 57
percent surge in its trading arm’s sales to $5.08 billion as
global demand for diamonds recovered from a recession in some of
the world’s largest economies. A carat is a fifth of a gram.  To contact the reporter on this story:
