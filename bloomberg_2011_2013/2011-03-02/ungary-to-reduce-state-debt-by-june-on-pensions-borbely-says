Hungary will probably cut state debt
as a percentage of gross domestic product by as much as 5.5
percentage points by the end of June by taking over privately
managed pension assets, the Debt Management Agency said today.    Government bonds  acquired from pension funds will probably
reduce debt by between 5 percentage points and 5.5 percentage
points in the first half of the year from 80 percent at the end
of 2010, Laszlo Andras Borbely, Deputy Chief Executive Officer
of the agency known as AKK, told state-run M1 television in an
interview.  Government debt accounts for about half of pension funds
and “the revenue from selling the remaining portion will also
cut state indebtedness,” Borbely said. Opportunities to acquire
pension fund assets won’t exist going forward, and the Cabinet
needs a “disciplined” fiscal policy to achieve further debt
reductions, he said.  The government yesterday unveiled a program to save as much
as 900 billion forint ($4.5 billion) from 2013, aiming to reduce
debt to below 60 percent of GDP by 2016 in what Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  called an “attack on government debt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
