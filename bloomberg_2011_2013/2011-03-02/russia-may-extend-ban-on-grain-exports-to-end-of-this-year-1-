Russia may extend a ban on grain
exports scheduled to expire at the end of June for the rest of
this year, First Deputy Prime Viktor Zubkov said.  No decision has been made yet, he told reporters in the
central Russian city of Tambov today. The government will look
at considerations including having “good carry-over stocks to
be able to have a grain intervention fund again” before
deciding on the measure, Zubkov said.  An extension to at least late 2011 is “highly likely,
given the government’s focus on capping inflation and food
prices in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in December
2011 and presidential polls in March 2012,” New York-based
political-risk researcher Eurasia Group said in an e-mailed note
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
