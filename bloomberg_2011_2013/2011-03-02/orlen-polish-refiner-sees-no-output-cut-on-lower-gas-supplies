PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil
refiner, said output won’t be affected by a reduction in gas
supplies after cold weather pushed up demand for the fuel.  Dominant gas supplier  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA , known as PGNiG, reduced deliveries under the
terms of the companies’ supply contract, the gas company said in
a regulatory statement today.  “Demand has been high for a long time and the weather is
forecast to remain cold,” Krzysztof Parkola, of PGNiG’s
investor relations department, said in a telephone interview,
adding that deliveries to households won’t be reduced.  Orlen will adjust its production processes and a planned
maintenance shutdown of the hydrocracking unit, which begins in
a few days’ time, will further reduce its gas needs, the Plock-
based company said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
