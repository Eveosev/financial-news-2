Spot gasoline in  New York  Harbor
strengthened after a government report showed imports of the
fuel to the region slipped along with inventories.  Gasoline supplies on the East Coast dropped 957,000 barrels
to 63.9 million barrels last week, according to the Energy
Department. Imports fell for the first time in three weeks,
slipping 76,000 barrels to 556,000 barrels a day.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor narrowed 0.25 cent to 17.50 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:26
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
of the fuel gained 5.58 cents to $2.8617 a gallon.  The premium for jet fuel at the hub rose for a second day
versus heating oil futures, increasing 2.25 cents to 21.75 cents
a gallon. It is the highest level since October 10, 2008.  Demand for the fuel,  based on a 4-week average,  rose 8.3
percent from the same period last year, according to the Energy
Department.    BP Plc  reported emissions from an ultracracker at its Texas
City refinery in Texas, according to a filing with state
regulators.  Spot gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  held steady at 18.5 cents a
gallon versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
