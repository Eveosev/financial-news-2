  Poland , which will take over the
European Union’s rotating presidency in July, wants the bloc to
consider setting up a mechanism to cut excise taxes
automatically when oil prices jump.  The taxes, which account for as much as half of the price
of motor fuels paid by the consumers at the pump, could be cut
without hurting national budget revenues, if oil prices remain
above a price threshold for a given time, Economy Minister
Waldemar Pawlak said in an interview in Warsaw today.  “Tax revenues could stay intact if a 20 percent rise in
the oil price is accompanied by a 10 percent cut in taxation,”
said Pawlak, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister.  Excise and value-added taxes on motor fuels are set by
individual EU members. The bloc sets minimum levels in euros per
1,000 liters for each type of motor fuel.  Oil traded near its highest closing price in 29 months in  New York  on concern that the unrest curbing crude exports from  Libya  will spread to the Middle East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
