Oyak-Renault,  Renault SA ’s Turkish
joint venture, may produce as much as 30,000 electric cars a
year in the Turkish plant,  Hurriyet  said, citing Renault’s
Europe head Jacques Chauvet.  A special consumption levy on electric car sales, announced
last week by the Turkish government, was satisfactory for the
industry, Chauvet said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
