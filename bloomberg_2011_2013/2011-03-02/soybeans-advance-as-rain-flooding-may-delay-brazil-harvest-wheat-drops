Soybeans rose for a second day in
Chicago on concern that rain in parts of  Brazil  may delay the
harvest and cause flooding, hurting the crop’s quality.  May-delivery soybeans gained 14 cents, or 1 percent, to
$13.8925 a bushel at 1:09 p.m. Paris time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Rapeseed traded in the French capital climbed to a
two-week high.  Brazil’s Mato Grosso state may have showers and
thunderstorms through the weekend after getting as much as 22
millimeters (0.9 inch) of rainfall, Telvent DTN Inc. said in a
March 1 forecast. Rain may disrupt the harvest and cause some
flooding, it said. The country is the world’s second-largest
soybean producer after the U.S.  “The return of the rains has caused a slight delay in the
progress of harvesting work,” Paris-based farm adviser Agritel
said in a comment today. “That added to the firmness of the
oilseed markets.”  Global soybean stocks are forecast by the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  to drop to a two-year low of 58.2 million metric
tons as output declines in Brazil and  Argentina , the biggest
producers after the U.S., and demand gains in  China .  Five days of above-normal rainfall prevented trucks from
unloading soybeans and corn at Paranagua, Brazil’s second-
largest port, and the line of waiting cargo extended 20
kilometers (12 miles), Lourenco Fregonese, business director at
the port, said yesterday.  More Exports  The port is expected to handle as much as 28 million tons
of corn, wheat, soybeans, soy meal and sugar this year, up 20
percent from 2010, as farmers boost exports to benefit from
rising prices, he said.  Rapeseed for May delivery climbed 1.3 percent to 466 euros
($644.34) a ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris. Prices reached 466.25
euros, the highest level since Feb. 15. The oilseed, like
soybeans, is used to make cooking oil and animal feed.  May-delivery corn rose 0.4 percent to $7.3875 a bushel in  Chicago , while wheat for May delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
$8.09 a bushel. Milling wheat for March delivery traded on NYSE
Liffe fell 0.1 percent to 257 euros a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
