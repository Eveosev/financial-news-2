  Kenya ’s shilling gained for the
first day in four against the dollar as inflows of the U.S.
currency from exporters in the agricultural and tourism
industries offset demand by oil importers.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 1.2 percent and was trading at 82.95 per dollar at 12:26
p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. Yesterday, it closed at 83.42
shillings.  “The shilling has been boosted by inflows from the
agricultural and tourism sectors, meeting the growing demand for
dollars from the oil importers,” John Muli, a trader at
Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview.  Kenya is the world’s biggest producer of black tea and
supplies a third of cut flowers to the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
