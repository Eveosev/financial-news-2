Brazil ’s central bank slowed the
pace of rate increases on a less-than-unanimous vote, saying
they need to implement policy adjustments “for a sufficiently
long period” to bring inflation to target next year.  Policy makers, led by central bank President Alexandre Tombini, voted 5-2 to raise the Selic rate by a quarter point to
12 percent from 11.75 percent, as expected by 15 of 58 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Forty-one analysts forecast a half-point
increase and two predicted a pause. The bank said that two board
members voted for a half-point increase.  The rate rise was smaller than the 0.5 percentage-point
increases the bank implemented at its January and March
meetings. Policy makers are betting that a combination of higher
borrowing costs, curbs on  consumer lending  and government
spending cuts will be enough to bring inflation back to its
target in 2012, according to the central bank’s quarterly
inflation report, published March 30.  Because of the “balance of inflation risks” and
“uncertain moderation of domestic activity,” policy makers
said in their statement that they see “the implementation of
adjustment in monetary conditions for a sufficiently long period
is the most adequate strategy to guarantee the convergence of
inflation to the target in 2012,” according to their statement
that accompanied their decision.  Currency Appreciation  The 6.4 percent appreciation of Brazil’s currency against
the dollar in the past month may have been decisive in
persuading policy makers to increase borrowing costs by 25 basis
points rather than 50, said Gustavo Rangel, chief Brazil
economist for ING Financial Markets in  New York .  “The central bank has a better outlook for inflation than
the market does,” Rangel said, speaking by telephone before the
rate decision. “It’s clear to everyone that foreign exchange is
a big thing here. That clearly adds to that more benign
assessment of inflation.”  Consumer prices rose 6.44 percent in the year through mid-
April, close to the upper limit of the central bank’s target
range of 4.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.  Economists surveyed by the central bank expect consumer
prices to rise 6.29 percent this year, and 5 percent in 2012,
according to an April 15 survey. The central bank itself expects
consumer prices to rise 5.6 percent this year, and 4.6 percent
in 2012, according to its so-called reference scenario, which
assumes an interest rate of 11.75 percent.  Commodity Prices  The central bank is betting that much of the quickening of
inflation this year will fade as a supply shock caused by higher
commodities prices recedes, said Pedro Tuesta, an economist for
Latin America at 4Cast Inc.  “They feel that they don’t need to rush to bring inflation
down, they can wait until 2012,” Tuesta said, speaking by
telephone from  Washington  before the rate decision was
announced. “They feel the macro-prudential measures will do the
job. They feel they don’t need to hike that much.”  Food and beverage prices rose 2.15 percent in the first
three months of 2011, after increasing 10.4 percent in 2010,
according to data collected by the central bank.  Tuesta forecasts inflation of 6.3 percent this year, and
5.2 percent in 2012.  Not Tolerant  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said April 18 that Brazil is
neither “patient” with nor “tolerant” of faster inflation,
and that the measures already taken will be effective after a
lag.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government cut 50.7 billion
reais ($32.4 billion) from its 2011 budget, to help curb
inflationary pressure. In December, the central bank raised
banks’ reserve requirements to slow credit growth, and this
month the  Finance Ministry  doubled to 3 percent the so-called
IOF tax on  consumer credit .  Total outstanding credit in Brazil’s economy rose 21
percent from a year earlier in February, to 1.74 trillion reais.
Tombini told lawmakers March 22 that growth in consumer credit
of more than 15 percent needs to be monitored “very carefully”
to avoid “excessive risks.”  The central bank forecasts credit growth of 13 percent in
2011, Tulio Maciel, acting head of the bank’s economic research
department, said March 29.  Retail Sales  Retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.4 percent in February,
down from a revised 1.1 percent increase in January. Tombini
said March 22 that the retail sector is “perhaps the best
expression of the current state of the economy.”  The yield on interest rate futures maturing in May 2011
rose five basis points to 11.92 percent. The real gained 0.6
percent to 1.5662 per dollar, its strongest close since Aug. 4,
2008. The real’s gain in the last month is the third best among
the 16-most traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the New
Zealand and Australian dollars.  Chile ’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for
the 10th time in 11 months at its April 12 policy meeting.
 Peru ’s central bank raised borrowing costs a quarter point to 4
percent in April, its ninth increase in 12 meetings.  Colombia 
raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25-point for a second
straight month in March to 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
