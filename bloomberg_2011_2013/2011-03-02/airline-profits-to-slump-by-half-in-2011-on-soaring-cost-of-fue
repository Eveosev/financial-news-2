Airlines stand to earn almost 50
percent less this year than in 2010 as rising oil prices limit
the benefits of a rebounding economy, the  International Air
Transport Association  predicted.  IATA cut its forecast for industry profit to $8.6 billion
from the $9.1 billion projected three months ago. In 2010,
airlines earned a combined $16 billion. IATA raised its oil-
price prediction to $96 a barrel for  Brent crude  from $84,
lifting the industry fuel bill by $10 billion to $166 billion.  “There is very little buffer for the industry to keep its
balance as it absorbs shock,” IATA Chief Executive Officer  Giovanni Bisignani  said in a statement. “Today, oil is the
biggest risk. If rises stall the global economic expansion, the
outlook will deteriorate very quickly.”  Brent futures rose to as much as $119.79 a barrel last week
on concern turmoil spreading across the Middle East may disrupt
supplies from  Iran , OPEC’s second-largest producer. Fuel will
account for 29 percent of total operating costs for airlines
this year, IATA said.  IATA predicted revenue of $594 billion for the industry
this year, for a profit margin of 1.4 percent. Airlines as a
group have lost money in seven of the last 10 years.  To reflect a strengthening global economy, IATA lifted its
passenger growth forecast to 5.6 percent from 5.2 percent, and
cargo growth to 6.1 percent from 5.5 percent. Asia Pacific
carriers are expected to have the largest collective profit this
year, at $3.7 billion, and the highest operating margins, at a
projected 4.6 percent, IATA said.  North American carriers will deliver $3.2 billion in
profit, unchanged from the previous forecast and down from $4.7
billion profit 2010, IATA said. European carriers are projected
to bring in collective profits of $500 million, up from the
previous forecast of $100 million.  While a weaker euro is stimulating exports, outbound
freight and long-haul business travel,  Europe ’s carriers will
still be the least profitable among the major regions, with an
expected operating margin of 1.1 percent, IATA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
