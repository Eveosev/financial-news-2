China’s National Development and
Reform Commission will ease limits on outbound investment by
Chinese companies, the Economic Information Daily reported
today, citing Kong Linglong, head of the NDRC’s department of
foreign capital and overseas investment.  Resources-related outbound investments of less than $300
million don’t need approval starting from this month, the report
said, citing Kong. Other Chinese investments overseas below $100
million will also not need approval, the report said, citing
Kong.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
