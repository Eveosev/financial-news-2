  South Africa  will probably produce
101,148 bales of cotton in the 2010-11 production year, 3
percent less than estimated last month,  Cotton South Africa 
said.  The latest forecast still means South Africa’s crop will be
more than double the previous season’s, and represents the first
increase in the harvest in seven years, the industry group said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The estimate includes expected output of 4,000 bales from
Swaziland, said Pretoria-based Cotton South Africa, which
represents growers, processors and textile makers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
