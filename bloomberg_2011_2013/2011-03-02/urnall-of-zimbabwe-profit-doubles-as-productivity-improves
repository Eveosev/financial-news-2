  Turnall  Holdings Ltd., a Zimbabwean
roofing and piping maker, said profit last year more than
doubled to $3.4 million on improvements in productivity.  Revenue also more than doubled to $34.9 million, the
Harare-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.
Turnall, which works mainly with cement and asbestos, plans to
commission a new “non-asbestos” plant this month, it said.  Revenue will probably increase 30 percent in the first
quarter compared with a year earlier, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
