  Alinma Bank , an Islamic lender based
in  Saudi Arabia , may expand in the future outside the Arab
world’s largest economy, according to its chief executive
officer.  “We are looking at local expansion in the short term, but
we are open for any opportunities in the future,” Abdulmohsen Al Fares told reporters at the Saudi Economic Forum in Riyadh
today.  Alinma grows locally by focussing on both retail and
corporate banking, he said. “Corporate will play a good role in
the mid- and short-term, while retail will be for the mid- and
long-term.” Alinma’s fourth-quarter profit rose to 67 million
riyals ($18 million) from 6 million riyals a year earlier.  Al Fares said Islamic financing has big potential,
especially in the wake of the global financial crisis. Demand
for Islamic banking instruments is growing worldwide, he added.  Alinma needs to start building provisions for bad loans
gradually, he said. On Feb. 20, Alinma reported loan-loss
provisions for the first time on record, setting aside 3 million
riyals in provisions in the fourth quarter. “This does not
necessarily indicate that provisions will increase this year,”
he said.  Alinma’s shares dropped 3.8 percent to 8.85 riyals, the
lowest level since they started trading in June 2008, at the
3:30 p.m. close in  Riyadh  today. The stock has fallen 16 percent
since the beginning of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
