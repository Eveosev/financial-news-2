Pro Bowl quarterback  Michael Vick 
agreed on a one-year contract with the  Philadelphia Eagles , two
weeks after the team ensured that he’d stay in Philadelphia by
giving him a franchise tag.  The Eagles didn’t disclose contract terms in announcing on
their website that Vick signed the franchise offer. Under
franchise tag rules, Vick would make an estimated $20 million,
according to the Associated Press.  Each National Football League team can apply the franchise
label to one player whose contract is expiring, preventing them
from becoming free agents. Players designated with the franchise
tag receive one-year contracts equal to the average of the five
highest-paid players at their positions the previous season,
under current rules. The players must accept that contract
figure and are barred from becoming free agents.  It hasn’t been determined whether the franchise tag will be
valid under a new collective bargaining agreement, which is
being negotiated between the NFL and its players union. The
current deal expires tomorrow, one second before midnight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
