  Mozambique ’s Nacala port will invest
$200 million over 20 years to boost capacity at its container
terminal, said Agostinho Langa, executive director of Corredor
De Desenvolvimento do Norte, the group that runs the facility.  The terminal will be expanded to handle 250,000 containers
compared with 75,000 containers now, Langa said today in an
interview in Maputo, the capital. The port, in northern
Mozambique, is also seeking to build a coal terminal, he said.  “The expansion will focus on the container terminal and we
are getting support from the Japanese International Cooperation
Agency,” Langa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
