  Indonesia , the world’s largest
exporter of power-plant coal, may revise a government plan and
allow lower quality coal to be exported after objections from
miners, an official said.  “We don’t want this rule to hamper investments although
it’s aimed at increasing exports of higher-value coal,” Bambang Setiawan, director general of coal and minerals at the Energy
and Mineral Resources Ministry, said today at a conference in
Balikpapan, East Kalimantan province. “Investors are worried
that they won’t be able to sell most of their output if the
grade limit is too high.”  Indonesia had planned to ban exports of the fuel with an
energy value of less than 5,600 kilocalories a kilogram starting
in 2014, requiring producers to upgrade the calorie if they want
to ship it overseas, Witoro Soelarno, then secretary to the
director general of coal and minerals at the energy ministry,
said in January.  The price of coal for sale in February with energy value
below 5,600 kilocalories a kilogram was set from $63.34 to
$95.62 a metric ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
News. That compares with $127.05 a ton for coal with 6,322
kilocalories a kilogram of energy value.  “It’s not an easy and cheap process to upgrade the
calories,” Setiawan said. “We need to adjust the limit to give
the producers the ability to sell their output without having to
invest too much on technology upgrades.”  The government’s main objective in setting the new rule is
to increase revenue from coal exports and ensure sufficient
supplies of the fuel for state utility PT Perusahaan Listrik
Negara, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
