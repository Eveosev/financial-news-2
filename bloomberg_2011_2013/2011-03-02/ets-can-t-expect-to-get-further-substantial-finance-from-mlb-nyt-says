The  New York Mets  can’t expect to
receive substantial financial assistance from  Major League
Baseball , which has extended a $25 million loan to the team, the
New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  The Mets are being sued by the trustee seeking to recover
money for victims of  Bernard Madoff ’s Ponzi scheme. The league
provided funds in November to help the Mets pay off loans and
service other financial obligations.  The league may reconsider its decision to keep the Mets
from being sold at a discount, the Times said, citing the
unidentified people. A modest short-term loan may be possible to
help the Mets pay players’ salaries when the season starts in a
month, the report said.  Mets’ owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz are looking to sell
as much as 25 percent of the team to raise money to cover any
liabilities from the Madoff lawsuit. The Mets are valued at $858
million, ranking them third among baseball’s 30 major league
teams, Forbes magazine said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
