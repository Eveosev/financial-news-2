Two U.S. airmen died and two were
seriously injured when a bus transporting U.S. military
personnel came under gunfire today at Frankfurt Airport,  Europe ’s third-busiest.  The incident took place at Terminal 2, and a young man was
arrested outside the bus as a suspect, said Juergen Linker, a
police spokesman, by phone today. The deaths and injuries were
confirmed by Sarayuth Pinthong, a spokesman at the U.S. air base
in Ramstein,  Germany .  The airport is operating normally though car traffic has
been diverted, a spokeswoman for Fraport AG, the airport’s
operator, said by phone. She declined to be identified by name
in accordance with the company’s policy.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , speaking to reporters in
Berlin, said the government will do “whatever is needed to
determine what happened” in the “terrible event.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
