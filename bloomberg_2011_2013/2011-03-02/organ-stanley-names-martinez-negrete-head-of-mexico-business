  Morgan Stanley , the world’s top
merger adviser last year, named Jaime Martinez-Negrete to a
newly created position as president of operations in  Mexico .  Martinez-Negrete joined the New York-based bank in 2008 as
co-head of investment banking in Mexico, according to an
internal memo obtained today by Bloomberg News. Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, confirmed the memo’s
contents.  Morgan Stanley last year started an equity sales and
trading team in Mexico led by Miguel Machado. Mexican deals the
firm has handled include advising Mexichem SAB on its $300
million purchase of Rockwood Holdings Inc.’s AlphaGary
thermoplastic compounds business and the sale of Gruma SAB’s
stake in Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB.  “Building our presence in Mexico is an important part of
our strategy for Latin America,” Christopher Harland, the
firm’s regional head of Latin America, said in the memo. “Last
year we launched a local equity cash-trading business and also
grew our fixed-income derivatives business.”  Martinez-Negrete spent 10 years in Credit Suisse Group AG’s  investment-banking  business in Mexico before joining Morgan
Stanley, according to the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
