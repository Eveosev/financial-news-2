(Corrects price of acquisition in third paragraph.)    BBA Aviation Plc , a U.K. provider of
services to private and corporate jets, said full-year profit
rose 36 percent as revenue from its flight support division
increased.  Net income for the year ended Dec. 31 climbed to 65.1
million pounds ($105.6 million) from 47.9 million pounds a year
earlier, the London-based company said in a statement
distributed by the Regulatory News Service today. Total revenue
rose 9.5 percent to 1.18 billion pounds.  Flight support sales increased 15 percent to 741.6 million
pounds as markets continued a “gradual recovery” from their
2009 lows, BBA Aviation said in the statement. BBA also said
today it is buying a fuel measurement business from General
Electric Co.’s aviation division for $62.5 million.  “2010 was a good year for BBA Aviation,” Chief Executive
Officer Simon Pryce said in today’s statement. “As our markets
continue their gradual recovery we expect to make further
progress in 2011. We expect to deliver a strong performance and
generate superior returns over the longer term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
