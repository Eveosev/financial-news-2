Gold rose to a record for the second
straight day on mounting demand for an investment haven amid
surging commodity prices and turmoil in Libya. Silver climbed to
the highest since 1980.  In  New York , gold futures reached $1,441 an ounce, the
highest ever. Crude oil topped $102 a barrel as Libyan rebels
braced for renewed clashes with forces loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi .
The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials rose
to the highest since September 2008.  “People are buying gold because they believe that
commodity inflation is coming,” said  Leonard Kaplan , the
president of Prospector Asset Management in Evanston,  Illinois .
“The geopolitical tension in the Middle East is forcing the
price of oil into the atmosphere, and that is going to derail
the economy.”  In other markets, oil climbed to a 29-month high and
gasoline surged on concern that the unrest curbing exports from  Libya  will spread in the region. Cotton jumped. The UBS
Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index of 26 prices
advanced 0.8 percent to 1,783.65. Earlier, the gauge reached
1,788.81, extending a rally to a record.  Gold futures for April delivery rose $6.50, or 0.5 percent,
to $1,437.70 on the Comex in New York. The metal, up for the
11th time in 12 sessions, has gained 26 percent in the past 12
months.  Silver futures for May delivery advanced 40.8 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $34.835 an ounce. Earlier, the metal reached
$34.975, the highest since March 7, 1980. In that year, the
record was $50.35. The commodity has doubled in the past 12
months.  Oil, Gasoline  Oil futures for April delivery rose $2.60, or 2.6 percent,
to $102.23 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Sept. 26, 2008.  Futures extended gains after a U.S. Energy Department
report showed that oil and fuel supplies fell last week.  “Prices are up on concern that the problems in Libya will
escalate, taking the remainder of the country’s oil off the
market, and spread elsewhere,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “As
long as the revolt continues, you are going to see a substantial  risk premium  in the oil price.”  Gasoline futures for April delivery advanced 4.61 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $3.0295 a gallon, the highest settlement since
Aug. 27, 2008.  Cotton  Cotton rose, extending a rally above $2 a pound, on signs
that global supplies will remain limited this year amid
increased demand from  China , the world’s biggest consumer.  Imports by China in January jumped 31 percent from a year
earlier after an 86 percent surge in 2010, government data show.
The price in New York more than doubled in the past 12 months,
reaching a record of $2.0893 on Feb. 18. The fiber jumped by the
exchange limit on ICE Futures U.S. for the fourth straight day
after dropping by the maximum in the previous four sessions.  “China seems to be still actively buying cotton,” said  Sid Love , the president of Joe Kropf & Sid Love Consulting
Services LLC in  Overland Park ,  Kansas . “This is a wild market
that none of us have ever witnessed.”  Cotton for May delivery rose by the limit of 7 cents, or
3.6 percent, to settle at $2.006 on ICE in New York. The price
has jumped 13 percent since Feb. 24.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
