The shekel weakened the most in more
than a week against the dollar as concern violence in the Middle
East will spread bolstered demand for the relative safety of the
U.S. currency.  Government bonds  declined for a second day.  The greenback advanced versus 12 of its 16 major
counterparts as Libyan rebels braced for renewed clashes with
forces loyal to leader  Muammar Qaddafi  and Al Arabiya television
reported Iranian protesters fought with security forces.  Israel ’s benchmark TA-25 Index of stocks dropped for a third
day, declining 1.2 percent as of 12:17 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  “Investors are more risk-averse, shoring up demand for
secure assets,” said Yaron Chechik, a currency trader at
Financial Immunities Ltd. in Rehovot, Israel. “There is a
negative environment in the global markets as violence in the
Middle East continues and the dollar is benefiting from that.”  The shekel dropped 0.2 percent to 3.6433 in  Tel Aviv . The
currency earlier weakened as much as 0.5 percent, the most since
Feb. 22, to 3.6536.  Government bonds declined, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit bond maturing January 2020
up 1 basis point to 5.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
