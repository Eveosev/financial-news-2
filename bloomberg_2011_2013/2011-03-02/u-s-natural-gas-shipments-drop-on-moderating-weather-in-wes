The price of natural gas for next-
day delivery in the U.S. Northeast rose the most in a week on
forecasts of colder weather that may boost demand for the
heating fuel.  The overnight low temperature in  New York  today may be 20
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 7 Celsius), 11 below normal, according
to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. The low
tomorrow may be 25 degrees, 7 below normal.  Wholesale natural gas for next-day delivery at the
Transco-Z6 hub, which transports the fuel to the New York City
area, soared $2.918, or 57 percent, to $8.0245 per million
British thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Gas at
the Tetco-M3 hub, which also delivers gas to New York, rose 41.8
cents, or 9.6 percent, to $4.7561.  Gas for next-day delivery at the  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, fell 14.53 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $3.7856. The hub
is the benchmark for gas futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Deliveries scheduled today for homes in the U.S. and Canada
fell 0.5 percent to 35 million dekatherms (34 billion cubic
feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Residences in the western U.S. were to receive 3.9 million
dekatherms of gas, 21 percent fewer than yesterday, Bloomberg
data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants dropped 6.2
percent to 11 million dekatherms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
