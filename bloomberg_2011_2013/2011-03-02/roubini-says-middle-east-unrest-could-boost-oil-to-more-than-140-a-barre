  Nouriel Roubini , an economist who
predicted the credit-market collapse, said an expansion of
troubles in the Mideast could push  oil prices  as high as $140 to
$150 per barrel, triggering a double-dip recession in parts of
Europe.  “If troubles spread to other countries such as Bahrain
and Saudi Arabia, this could push oil prices up to $140 to $150
per barrel, which could trigger a double-dip recession in the
periphery of Europe and the U.K.,” Roubini said at a conference
in Paris today.  “We need to worry about inflation” because of the rise in
commodity prices and large parts of public deficits being
monetized in some countries, Roubini said. The “slack in labor
and goods markets will not lead to a significant rise in  core
inflation  or to second-round effects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
