Australian independent Senator Nick Xenophon said he will block Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s A$1.8
billion ($1.82 billion) tax to pay to rebuild flood-devastated
Queensland unless states are forced to get disaster insurance.  “I will not be supporting this levy, unless changes are
made to the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements
that will give states strong incentives to seek appropriate
disaster cover, with strong disincentives if they do not,”
Xenophon told the Senate in Canberra today. Voting on the
measure is set for March 21.  Xenophon is the one Senator left Gillard must win to pass
her tax on middle and high income earners. She gained support
from four lower house lawmakers outside her ruling  Labor Party 
by funding A$150 million worth of extra programs in their
electorates. She has also announced A$2.8 billion in budget cuts
and A$1 billion in delayed spending for the flood rebuilding.  Since the deluge, which killed at least 36 people, fires in  Western Australia  have destroyed 68 structures and Tropical
Cyclone Yasi tore through sugar and banana-producing areas in
northern Queensland.  Treasurer Wayne Swan today said the flooding trimmed fourth
quarter economic growth by 0.4 percentage points. Growth in the
economy, which expanded 0.7 percent in the three months ended
Dec. 31, will be cut by a percentage point in the first quarter
of 2011, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
