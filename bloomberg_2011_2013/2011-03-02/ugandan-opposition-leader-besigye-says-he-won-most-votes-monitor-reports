Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye, who lost a Feb. 18 presidential election, said he won
more votes than incumbent President Yoweri Museveni, the  Daily
Monitor  reported.  Besigye’s tally gave him 47 percent support, against
Museveni’s 44.9 percent, the Kampala-based newspaper cited him
as saying yesterday. Both the ruling National Resistance
Movement and the  Electoral Commission , which gave Museveni a 68
percent of the vote, compared with Besigye’s 26 percent,
rejected the opposition leader’s tally, it said.  European Union observers said last month the election was
“marred by avoidable and logistical failures, which led to an
unacceptable number of Ugandan citizens being disenfranchised.”
Commonwealth election monitors had “serious concerns” that there
wasn’t a level playing field in the run-up to polling, mission
leader Dame Billie Miller told reporters on Feb. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
