New Jersey Governor Chris Christie
said he could win the presidency, though he insisted again that
he won’t run in 2012, according to the National Review.  “I have people calling me and saying to me, ‘Let me
explain to you how you could win,’” he said in the  interview ,
which was posted online and dated yesterday. “And I’m like,
‘You’re barking up the wrong tree. I already know I could win.’
That’s not the issue. The issue is not me sitting here and
saying, ‘Geez, it might be too hard. I don’t think I can win.’ I
see the opportunity both at the primary level and at the general
election level.”  Christie, 48, a first-term Republican, said in the
interview that he doesn’t think he is ready to be president.  “I’ve got to believe I’m ready to be president, and I
don’t,” Christie was quoted as saying. “And I think that
that’s the basis you have to make that decision.”  The National Review was founded in 1955 by the writer
William F. Buckley, who used the magazine to advocate for
individual liberty, limited government and the defeat of
Communism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
