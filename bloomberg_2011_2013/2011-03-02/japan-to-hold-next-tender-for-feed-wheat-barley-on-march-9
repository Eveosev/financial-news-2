Japan will hold a tender on March 9
for a maximum of 30,000 metric tons of feed wheat and 200,000
tons of feed barley, according to the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries.  The ministry, which holds feed-grain import tenders every
Wednesday, didn’t purchase anything today because of a lack of
demand from end-users, Masafumi Otsuka at the ministry’s grain-
trade division, said by phone.  Tenders are held under the so-called simultaneous buy-and-
sell system, in which feed makers and trading companies jointly
bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
