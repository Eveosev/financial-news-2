  BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc ., the U.S.
membership warehouse chain exploring a possible sale, forecast
first-quarter profit that surpassed analysts’ estimates after
raising membership fees.  Profit will be 54 cents to 58 cents, the Westborough,
Massachusetts-based retailer said today in a statement. Analysts
on average project 52 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey.  The chain, led by Chief Executive Officer Laura Sen, raised
its basic membership fee to $50 from $45 this year for the first
time in five. The third-largest U.S. membership warehouse
retailer said last month that it hired Morgan Stanley to
examine options. The chain trails  Costco Wholesale Corp . and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Sam’s Club by revenue.  Sales in the three-month period ended Jan. 29 rose 7.3
percent to $2.96 billion, meeting analysts’ predictions. Net
income fell 81 percent to $10.2 million, or 19 cents a share,
from $54.5 million, or $1. Excluding costs for restructuring,
club closures and asset impairments, profit was 95 cents a
share, compared with the 91-cent average of estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  The stock fell 11 cents to $48.31 yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are little changed
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
