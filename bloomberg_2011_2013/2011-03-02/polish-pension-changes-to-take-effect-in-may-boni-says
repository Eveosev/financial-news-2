  Poland ’s government maintains its
position that contributions to private pension funds should be
reduced to help curb the deficit, according to Michal Boni, an
adviser to Prime Minister  Donald Tusk .  The government will discuss the changes on March 8,
allowing the Parliament to begin the debate on the plan a week
later, Boni said at a press conference in Warsaw. Changes may
take effect in May, he said.  The government plans to cut transfers to private-pension
funds to 2.3 percent of employees’ salaries from 7.3 percent,
moving the rest to the state-run pension system to curb the  budget deficit  and keep public debt below a legal threshold of
55 percent of gross domestic product.  As a result of the changes, Poland’s borrowing needs will
fall by 180 billion zloty between 2012 and 2020, Boni said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
