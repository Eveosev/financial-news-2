The European Banking Authority will
publish stress-test scenarios and details of the lenders
involved in the exams on March 18, it said on its website today.  The agency said it would give banks details of the
scenarios this week and publish the results of the tests on
banks’ capital in June after a “vigorous peer review.”  Last year’s European Union stress tests were criticized for
not being stringent enough because lenders in the 27-nation
region were shown by regulators to need only 3.5 billion euros
($4.8 billion) of new capital, about a 10th of the lowest
analyst estimate.  This year’s economic scenarios “will incorporate a
significant deviation from the baseline forecast and country-
specific shocks on real estate prices,  interest rates  and
sovereigns,” the authority said in the  statement . Last year’s
tests also examined the possible impact of a reduction in the
market price of sovereign debt.  European regulators at the EBA met in  London  today to
discuss the methodology of the 2011 tests on banks’ capital
and also to approve a candidate for the role of executive
director. The EBA named Adam Farkas, formerly chairman of the
Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority, to the post.  To contact the reporters on this story:
