Carlsberg A/S’s OAO Baltika beer
producer declined the most in more than a week after its parent
slashed profit forecasts due to faltering sales in  Russia .  The unit’s Moscow shares fell 4.3 percent to 1,123 rubles
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest loss since Aug. 8.  Carlsberg said the market in Russia will decline at a “low
single-digit” rate, compared with a previous forecast of 2
percent to 4 percent growth. The company cited higher taxes on
beer as well as bad weather, and said it no longer expects to
increase market share in Russia this year.  Carlsberg, the owner of the Baltika brand, gets about 45
percent of its profit from Russia, where President Dmitry Medvedev last month approved a law that will prohibit beer sales
from kiosks by 2013 and restrict advertising.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
