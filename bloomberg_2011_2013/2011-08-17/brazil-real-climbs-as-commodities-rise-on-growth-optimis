Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts fell as a report showing the economy
posted its first monthly contraction since 2008 spurred traders
to step up bets the central bank will lower  interest-rates .  Yields on the contract due in January 2013 fell twelve
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 11.75 percent, the
lowest since November 4. The contract due in January 2012 fell
four basis points to 12.25 percent.  Slower global growth is driving down commodities prices and
curbing inflation expectations, leading traders to bet that
Brazilian policy makers will cut interest rates by a quarter
point by year-end. Brazilian economic activity, a proxy for
gross domestic product, fell a more-than-forecast 0.26 percent
in June from the previous month, the first drop since the global
financial crisis of 2008, according to the central bank’s
seasonally adjusted index released today. That compares to a
median estimate for a 0.05 percent drop in a Bloomberg survey of
10 economists.  “Industrial production in June was weak and clearly had an
effect on reducing growth,” Marcelo Gazano, an economist at RBS
Securities Inc. in  Sao Paulo , said in a telephone interview.
“This signals a negative trend for GDP.”  Job growth in July was lower than all 10 forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. Industrial production fell 1.6
percent in June, the second-biggest drop in output since 2008,
and business confidence in the second quarter fell to its lowest
level since 2009.  ‘Recession Abroad’  “This movement of an expectation in rate cuts is
continuing,” Mariano Cirello, director of investment at Mapfre
DTVM SA in Sao Paulo, said before the economic activity data was
released. “The market understands that a possible recession
abroad would be a stronger movement,” he said in a telephone
interview.  Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its 2011 GDP growth forecast for
 Brazil  to 3.6 percent from 3.8 percent, in a report distributed
today. Nomura also trimmed its 2012 GDP forecast to 3.55 percent
from 3.7 percent.  Gazano of RBS said he may cut his growth forecast to 3.5
percent from 4 percent for 2011.  The real advanced 0.1 percent to 1.5880 per dollar, from
1.5901 yesterday, as commodities gained today.  Sugar surged the most in five weeks on renewed concern that
the crop in Brazil, the world’s largest producer, will be
smaller than forecast. Crude rose advanced as the dollar fell
against the euro, increasing the appeal of dollar-denominated
commodities as an investment. The S&P GSCI index of 24
commodities advanced 1 percent as oil jumped 1.1 percent.  “The world continues with caution, but today the tone is
more positive,” said  Vladimir Caramaschi , chief economist of
 Credit Agricole ’s Brazilian unit in Sao Paulo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
