OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel was
sued by its partner in an iron-ore venture after assuming
ownership of a license to the venture’s largest ore deposit,
Interfax reported, citing court documents.  Atop International Group, which holds 49 percent of the OAO
Bakalskoye Rudoupravleniye venture, filed a suit in Chelyabinsk,
 Russia , after the license to the Techenskoye ore field was
transferred to Magnitogorsk, the news service said. Magnitogorsk
got the license in May following regulatory approval.  “We see no legitimate grounds for this suit,” Kirill
Golubkov, a spokesman for Magnitogorsk, said today by phone when
Bloomberg News called, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
