Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) ,
 Egypt â€™s biggest publicly traded builder, jumped to the highest
level in a week after winning the civil works contract for a
power plant in the Arab country.  Shares of the Cairo-based company climbed 2.1 percent to
253 Egyptian pounds at 11:21 a.m. in Cairo, the highest intraday
level since Aug. 10. That gave the company a market value of
52.4 billion pounds ($8.8 billion). The benchmark EGX 30 Index
advanced 1.4 percent.  The company, also known as OCI, said it won a $181 million
contract for civil works on a 1,500 megawatt power plant in
Giza, Egypt. The project, awarded by the Cairo Electricity
Production Co., is expected to be completed in 32 months,
Orascom said.  Orascom is constructing power plants in Egypt and  Algeria 
with a combined generating capacity of 5,250 megawatts. The
shares have gained 11 percent since the Egyptian Exchange opened
March 23 after trading was halted for almost two months because
of political unrest. That compares with a 17 percent decline for
the  EGX 30 Index. (EGX30)   To contact the reporter on this story:
