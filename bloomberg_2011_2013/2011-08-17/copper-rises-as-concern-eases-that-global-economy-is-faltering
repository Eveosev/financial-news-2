Copper rose for the fourth time in
five sessions as concern eased that the U.S. and global
economies are faltering.  U.S. manufacturing climbed in July by the most this year,
and Chinese industrial output jumped 14 percent. Most industrial
metals and raw materials gained today.  China  is the world’s
leading copper user, followed by the U.S.  “China is growing fairly robustly, and manufacturing will
rebound across the world,”  Bart Melek , an analyst at TD
Securities in Toronto, said in a telephone interview. “The
prospect for the metal looks pretty good.”  Copper futures for December delivery gained 3.8 cents, or
0.9 percent, to close at $4.053 a pound at 1:11 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The price gained 3.6 percent since Aug. 10.  The metal has climbed 21 percent in the past year as mining
companies struggled to keep pace with rising consumption.  “Supply-and-demand dynamics” will drive prices, “and
when there is a bit more certainty, we’ll have more risk trade
happening,” Melek said.  Copper may average $4.30 in 2012, compared with a projected
$4.24 in 2011, he said. The metal has averaged $4.28 this year.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $135, or 1.5 percent, to $8,965 a metric ton
($4.07 a pound).  Aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc also rose in London. Tin
fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
