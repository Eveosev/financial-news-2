China Shenhua Energy Co., a unit of
the country’s biggest coal producer, said first-half profit rose
16 percent, after it acquired assets to expand production in the
world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Net income rose to 21.9 billion yuan ($3.42 billion) from a
restated 18.8 billion yuan a year earlier, Shenhua said in a
statement to the  Hong Kong  stock exchange today, citing
preliminary data based on Chinese accounting standards. Revenue
rose 40.5 percent to 100.7 billion yuan.  In December, China Shenhua agreed to pay 8.7 billion yuan
for assets including mining rights and companies involved in
power generation owned by parent Shenhua Group Corp.  Production at China Shenhua may rise to as much as 270
million metric tons this year, exceeding the company’s annual
target of 258 million metric tons, Chairman Zhang Xiwu said in
March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
