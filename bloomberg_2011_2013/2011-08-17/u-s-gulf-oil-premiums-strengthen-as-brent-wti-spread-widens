U.S. Gulf oil premiums strengthened
after the discount of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude to
Brent increased.  The gap between October contracts widened to $22.87 a
barrel, below the Aug. 10 record of $23.79. When Brent increases
versus WTI, it strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades
that compete with West African oil priced against the European
benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium added 65 cents to $21.65 a
barrel at 3:52 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 40 cents to $24.60 a
barrel over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 95 cents to $20.70 while Poseidon’s gained $1 to
$20.50 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased 25 cents to
$18.25 a barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 12
cents to 87 cents below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium
added $1.60 to $25.50.  The premium for Syncrude increased 45 cents to $14.70 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 85 cents to
$12.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
