Gasoline futures rose as the Energy
Department reported that inventories fell to the lowest level in
12 weeks.  Gasoline stockpiles shrank 3.51 million barrels in the week
ended Aug. 12 to 210.1 million. It was the largest drop since
the week ended April 8. Until last week, gasoline inventories
were higher than at the start of the summer driving season in
late May.  “We haven’t really been drawing gasoline this summer, so
this is good,” said  David Pursell , a managing director at Tudor
Pickering Holt & Co. LLC in Houston. “But it may be too little,
too late. Summer is over.”  Gasoline for September delivery rose 1.65 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.8703 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Futures rose as high as $2.9268 before paring gains as
equities retreated. The  Standard & Poor’s  500 index was little
changed at 3:28 p.m., after gaining as much as 1.3 percent.  “You got weak equities later on in the afternoon,” said
Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. “But
the dollar is pretty weak.”  The dollar touched a three-week low versus a basket of
currencies of U.S. trading partners, increasing the investment
appeal of commodities. The Dollar Index fell 0.4 percent as of
2:52 p.m.  U.S. gasoline use typically peaks between the holidays of
Memorial Day in late May and Labor Day, which this year falls on
Sept. 5.  Refinery Outages  Last week’s supply decline came as refineries shut units
for unplanned repairs and imports trailed year-earlier levels.  “We have had a number of refining problems, most notably
Valero Memphis, and we’ve been seeing lower imports into the
U.S.,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Memphis refinery, struck by a fire
Aug. 5, may be shut as long as two months, Tennessee Governor
Bill Hasla said in a letter to the Environmental Protection
Agency on Aug. 11. The plant can process 195,000 barrels of
crude oil daily, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Refiners reduced rates 0.9 percentage point to 89.1
percent. The highest level of refinery usage this summer was in
the week ended July 15 when refiners operated at 90.3 percent of
capacity.  Imports Rise  U.S. imports of gasoline rose 7 percent to 677,000 barrels
a day, 37 percent below a year earlier.  “The bullishness comes from the lower refinery rates and
constraints in imports,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with
Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .
“What’s neutral is that demand is not great and driving season
is basically over.”  Futures have surged 7.6 percent since Aug. 9 when gasoline
slid to a five-month low settlement after the  Federal Reserve 
said it will maintain record-low  interest rates  at least through
2013, noting a weaker labor market.  Supplies of heating oil and diesel rose 2.45 million
barrels to 154 million, the fifth increase in six weeks, leaving
inventories at a five-month high. The survey projected a gain of
550,000 barrels.  Demand for industrial, trucking and home-heating fuels over
the past four weeks fell 10 percent to 3.55 million barrels a
day. On a four-week average, consumption was 5.8 percent higher
than a year earlier.  Heating oil for September delivery rose 2.9 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $2.9616 gallon on the exchange, the
highest settlement since Aug. 3.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.3
cent to $3.584 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
