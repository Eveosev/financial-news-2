Tanzania’s shilling appreciated as
dollar proceeds from exports of cotton started flowing into the
market.  The currency of East  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
appreciated as much as 0.4 percent to 1,611.5 per dollar and
traded 0.2 percent stronger at 1,614.75 by 1:40 p.m. in Dar es
Salaam, the commercial capital.  “Some proceeds came in from the cotton sector, because the
exporting season is now beginning,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader
with National Bank of Commerce Ltd.,  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) ’s Tanzanian
unit, said by phone. “This stabilized the shilling and caused a
slight appreciation. The market has however been mostly quite,
with no big deals.”  Tanzania is Africa’s second-biggest producer of cotton
after Nigeria, according to the  Food and Agriculture
Organization . Output of the fiber this season may jump 53
percent to 250,000 metric tons as farmers planted more of the
crop to benefit from higher prices, Daily News newspaper
reported May 3, citing Marco Mtunga, director general of the
Cotton Board.  To contact the reporters on this story:
