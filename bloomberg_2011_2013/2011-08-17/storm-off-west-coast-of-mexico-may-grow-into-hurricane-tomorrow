(Corrects Justin Roberti’s job title in final paragraph.)  Tropical Storm Greg formed in the
Pacific off southwestern  Mexico  and is expected to grow into a
hurricane tomorrow, posing no threat to land, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said.  Greg is moving west-northwest with winds of 40 miles (64
kilometers) per hour, the center said in a website  advisory . It
warned that heavy coastal rains are possible today in the
Mexican states of Guerrero and Michoacan. It will issue another
update before 8 a.m.  Los Angeles  time.  In the Caribbean, storms associated with a tropical wave
have a 30 percent chance of forming into a tropical cyclone, the
center  said .  “Weak systems like this can still produce heavy rain
across the Caribbean,” said Justin Roberti, a spokesman for
AccuWeather Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
