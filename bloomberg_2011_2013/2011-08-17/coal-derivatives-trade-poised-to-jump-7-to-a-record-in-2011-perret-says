Coal trading is poised to advance 7
percent to a second consecutive all-time high this year of 3.2
billion metric tons, according to Perret Associates Ltd.  The volume of coal derivatives bought and sold worldwide
was a record 3 billion metric tons last year, based on data from
exchanges and brokers, Guillaume Perret, founder of the coal-
industry research group and adviser, said by e-mail. Global coal
consumption advanced 7.6 percent last year, a faster pace than
crude oil, natural gas and nuclear, according to statistics
published by BP Plc in June.  Coal trading fell by about 50 percent in April compared
with the same month in 2010, partly because of a higher-than-
normal number of public holidays in the U.K., Perret said.
Volumes in June and July were about 25 percent more than the
same months a year earlier, he said.  “Traditionally, the period from September through December
is active in physical and financial trading,” Perret said.
“Hence we expect total volumes in 2011 to exceed those of 2010,
despite the relatively slow start we had.”  Aggregate monthly Rotterdam-contract trading on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in  London  in July was 2.8 million tons,
47 percent more than the 1.9 million tons in the same month last
year, exchange data show. So far this year, 19.6 million tons
have traded, compared with 40 million tons during the whole of
last year and 28.7 million tons in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
