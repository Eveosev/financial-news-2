The  European Central Bank  bought
Italian government bonds today, according to two people familiar
with the transactions.  The purchases were in small volumes and included 10-year
securities, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the trades are confidential.  A spokeswoman from the ECB declined to comment when
contacted today by telephone.  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds fell two basis points to
4.97 percent at 1:15 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
