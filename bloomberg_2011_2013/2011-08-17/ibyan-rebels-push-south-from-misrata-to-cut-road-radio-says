Libyan rebel forces broke out of the
besieged city of Misrata and pushed south toward a strategic
highway linking up to Tripoli, a city radio station reported.  A column of armed jeeps drove unopposed through the desert
to the village of Bir Durfan and is heading for Beni Walid, 40
miles (64 kilometers) away, to link up to the highway to the
capital,  Libya  Freedom Voice in Misrata reported yesterday.  “They expect to reach Beni Walid in the next days,” said
Ramadan Maiteeg, a reporter at Freedom Voice, the city’s
principal rebel radio station.  A second advance south from Misrata along the coastal
highway captured a key traffic junction, Bowaba Aseteen, and
rebels are battling for control of the coastal town of Al
Heesha, 65 miles south of Misrata, which is in western Libya.
Three fighters are reported dead, Maiteeg said.  There was no independent confirmation of the advances,
which follow the capture over the weekend of the southern town
of Tawarga.  Rebel forces in the west continue to hold Zawiya, 35 miles
from the capital, cutting the coastal highway to  Tunisia , and
fighting continues for control of the oil town of Brega, 300
miles to the east, according to Libya Freedom Voice. The station
has changed its name from Radio Misrata.  The conflict in Libya entered its sixth month today with
the rebels claiming advances after several weeks of stalemate.
 Muammar Qaddafi , who seized power in the oil-rich North African
nation in a military coup in 1969, controls Tripoli and has told
his followers to keep fighting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
