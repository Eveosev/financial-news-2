Serbiaâ€™s government may increase
prices of natural gas by 15 percent on average,  Tanjug   news
agency  reported, citing Dusan Bajatovic, the head of state-run
 Srbijagas  gas company.  The country that relies on imports of Russian gas should
allow 30 percent higher prices for households and industrial
consumers to adjust to rising costs since 2008 when it last
changed the price caps, Bajatovic reportedly said. A smaller
increase is more likely in order to preserve macroeconomic
stability, the report quoted him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
