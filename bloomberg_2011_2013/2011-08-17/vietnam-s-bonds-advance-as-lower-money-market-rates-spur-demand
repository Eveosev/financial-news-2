Vietnam ’s bonds rose, pushing five-
year yields to the lowest level this week, on speculation a
decline in money-market rates will make it cheaper to buy debt
with borrowed funds. The dong weakened.  The one-week interbank deposit rate fell 16 basis points to
12.17 percent, the lowest since June, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The central banks aims to lower dong lending rates
to a range of 17 percent to 19 percent, newly appointed Governor
Nguyen Van Binh said in an interview on Vietnam Television on
Aug. 4. The rates were as high as 25 percent in July, according
to a statement posted Aug. 3 on the central bank’s website.  “Investors rushed to the secondary market to buy
 government bonds  with the expectation that  interest rates  will
significantly decrease in the near future,” ACB Securities Inc.
wrote in a research note today.  The yield on the benchmark five-year note dropped one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.57 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong fell 0.1 percent to 20,690 per dollar as of 4:21
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,618 today, unchanged
since Aug. 10, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
