Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR) , the Chilean
department store operator that set aside $900 million in June
for consumer loan losses, has hired investment banks  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) 
and MBA Lazard to advise on its financial restructuring.  Chilean financial services firm Larrain Vial SA, which
advised on the first stages of negotiations with creditors, will
no longer lead the process, La Polar said in a filing posted
last night on the website of Chile’s securities regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
