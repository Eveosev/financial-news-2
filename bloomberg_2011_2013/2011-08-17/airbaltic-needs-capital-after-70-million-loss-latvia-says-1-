AirBaltic AS, the Latvian airline
that’s majority-owned by the state, will need fresh capital
following a loss of about 34.2 million lati ($69.8 million) last
year, the Transport Ministry said.  AirBaltic’s financial situation is “serious,” the
ministry said in a  statement  today. The Latvian airline has the
lowest core capital ratio of all European airlines and needs
cash to continue to operate and develop, it said.  The company’s supervisory council yesterday called for a
recapitalization of at least 60 million lati, according to the
ministry.  Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said it was
difficult to support recapitalization without knowing what
happened to 15 million lati the state invested in the company’s
capital previously, the  Leta  newswire reported. Transport
Minister Uldis Augulis’s suitability for his position will be
reviewed if the company’s shareholder agreement isn’t revised
and the finances solved, Dombrovskis said, the Riga-based
newswire reported.  The Baltic country will hold parliamentary elections on
Sept. 17.  The airline’s offices were raided in May amid a criminal
probe by the country’s anti-corruption bureau. The Latvian state
owns 52.6 percent of AirBaltic while Baltic Aviation Systems has
47.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
