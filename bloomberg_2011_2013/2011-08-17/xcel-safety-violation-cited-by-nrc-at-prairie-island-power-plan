Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL)  was cited by the
 Nuclear Regulatory Commission  after inspectors found flaws in
safety-related battery chargers at a power plant in Welch,
Minnesota.  The chargers at Prairie Island Unit 1, run by Xcel’s
Northern States Power Co.-Minnesota unit, were “susceptible to
failure under certain conditions,” Mark Satorius, a regional
administrator for the agency, said today in a statement.  The NRC said the Minneapolis-based operator, which had
resolved the deficiencies, will be subject to additional
oversight.  The agency described the violation as having low to
moderate safety significance.  The devices charge batteries that would provide backup
power to remotely operate the Prairie Island plant safety
equipment. Each reactor has two chargers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
