Shui On Land Ltd. (272) , the Shanghai-
based developer controlled by  Hong Kong  billionaire Vincent Lo,
said first-half profit fell 50 percent after it completed fewer
properties.  Net income in the six months to June 30 dropped to 784
million yuan ($123 million), or 0.13 yuan a share, from 1.56
billion yuan a year earlier, or 0.31 yuan, Hong Kong-listed Shui
On said in a stock exchange filing today. Revenue fell to 1.79
billion from 3.12 billion yuan.  Lo, the youngest son of late Hong Kong property tycoon Lo Ying-shek, is tapping  China ’s growth by building high-end real
estate residential and commercial projects that cater to the
nation’s growing middle class. The company plans to spend about
8 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) to develop Hongqiao Tiandi, an
office and restaurant precinct under its Xintiandi brand near
 Shanghai ’s smaller airport and high-speed rail station.  China’s July housing transactions fell 30 percent from June
as the government intensified measures to avert a property
market bubble, including limiting home purchases in metropolitan
areas such as Shanghai and Beijing, and raising down-payment
requirements and mortgage rates earlier this year.  Shui On fell 1.3 percent to HK$3.11 at the 4 p.m. close in
Hong Kong, before the announcement. The stock has fallen 17
percent this year, compared with the 12 percent decline in the
 Hang Seng Index .  Shui On is working to spin off its property leasing
business in China and seeking an initial public offering, which
will likely be in Hong Kong, Lo said in a June 29 interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
