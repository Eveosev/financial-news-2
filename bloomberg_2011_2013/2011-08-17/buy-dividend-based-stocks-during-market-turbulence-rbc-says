Dividend-based equity portfolios
tend to perform better than others regardless of the economic
environment, and are attractive amid the recent turbulence,
Royal Bank of Canada’s Myles Zyblock said in a note today.  Using dividend-paying stocks to raise portfolios’ income
exposure could provide insulation during market volatility,
Zyblock wrote in the note. He recommended 15 stocks that
recently raised their dividends and are rated “outperform” by
RBC fundamental analysts, including  Amgen Inc. (AMGN) , the world’s
largest biotechnology company, and  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s
biggest computer-chip maker.  U.S. stocks posted unprecedented swings last week as
investors weighed signs of a resilient economy against the first
downgrade of America’s top credit rating by S&P and the European
crisis. The  S&P 500  fell 13 percent from April 29 through
yesterday amid concern about a slowdown and  Europe ’s widening
sovereign-debt crisis.  “We find dividend-based portfolios tend to outperform
through time and across various macro environments,” Zyblock,
who is based in Toronto and is RBC’s chief institutional
strategist, said. “A strategy that offers a high return per
unit of risk is something we can buy into, especially in today’s
volatile market.”
