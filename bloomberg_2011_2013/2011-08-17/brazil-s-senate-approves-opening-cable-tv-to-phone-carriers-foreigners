Brazil ’s Senate approved a  law 
allowing telephone carriers and foreign companies to offer cable
television, creating new opportunities for  Tele Norte Leste
Participacoes SA (TNLP3)  and America Movil SAB. Cable carrier Net
Servicos SA’s bonds jumped the most in a year.  The Senate approved the bill yesterday. The measure already
has been passed by the lower house of Congress and awaits the
signature of President Dilma Rousseff. The bill lifts the
current 49 percent cap on foreign ownership of cable operators,
Brazilian newspapers  Folha de Sao Paulo  and  Valor Economico 
reported yesterday on their websites.  Under the new law, America Movil, based in Mexico City,
would be able to exercise an option it has to take control of
the voting shares of Net Servicos, Brazil’s largest cable
company. America Movil, controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim ,
already owns 49 percent of the voting shares and a 92 percent
financial stake in Net.  Net 7.5 percent bonds due in 2015 rose 2.71 cents on the
dollar, the biggest jump since March 10, 2010, to 117.78,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on the notes
fell to 4.9 percent, the lowest since the bonds were issued in
October 2009.  Net shares fell 30 centavos, or 1.9 percent, to 15.30 reais
at 4 p.m. New York time in  Sao Paulo , where the cable carrier is
based.  Pay-TV carriers are getting into the phone and Internet
business, causing phone companies to seek television service to
prevent customer defections. Tele Norte Leste, Brazil’s biggest
fixed-line carrier, could offer TV service over its phone lines.  Oi, as Tele Norte Leste is known, America Movil and rival
land-line carrier  Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA (TLPP3)  already offer
satellite-TV service in Brazil.  Oi, based in  Rio de Janeiro , fell 43 centavos, or 2
percent, to 21.20 reais in Sao Paulo trading. Telecomunicacoes
de Sao Paulo, controlled by Madrid-based  Telefonica SA (TEF) , rose 80
centavos, or 1.7 percent, to 46.80 reais. America Movil gained
19 centavos, or 1.3 percent, to 14.90 pesos in Mexico City.  To contact the reporters on this story:
