Two-time Grand Slam champion  Lleyton Hewitt  of Australia and Americans Robby Ginepri and Donald Young
were among seven men given wild-card entries into the  U.S. Open .  Hewitt, 30, won the tournament in 2001, while Ginepri, 28,
advanced to the semifinals in 2005, his best career finish at a
Grand Slam. They and Young are joined as wild-cards by Julien Benneteau of France and Americans Ryan Harrison, Jack Sock and
2011 collegiate champion Steve Johnson, the  United State Tennis
Association  said today in an e-mailed release.  The U.S. Open, the final Grand Slam of the tennis schedule,
runs Aug. 29-Sept. 11 at the National Tennis Center in Flushing
Meadows,  New York . An American male hasn’t won the tournament,
which carries a $1.8 million purse for the singles champions,
since  Andy Roddick  in 2003.  Young, 22, won the 2005 Australian Open Junior
Championships and the 2007 Junior Wimbledon. After not receiving
an invitation to qualify at the  French Open  this year, Young has
risen to No. 89 in the ATP World Tour rankings, his highest in
more than three years.  Harrison, at 19 the youngest American in the top 100 at No.
78, lost in five sets to Sergiy Stakhovsky in the second round
at the U.S. Open last year after failing to convert three match
points in the fifth-set tiebreak. Sock, 18, won his second
consecutive USTA Boys’ 18s title on Aug. 14 and Johnson, 21, is
the reigning National Collegiate Athletic Association champion
from the  University of Southern California .  Benneteau, 29, has a 10-15 record this season after
reaching a career-high No. 32 in 2010.  One more spot will be given to the winner of the  U.S. Open 
Wild Card Playoff, an eight-player invitation in College Park,
 Maryland , this week, the USTA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
