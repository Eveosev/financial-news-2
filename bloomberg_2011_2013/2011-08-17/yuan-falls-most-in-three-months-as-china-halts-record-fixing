China ’s yuan fell the most in almost
two weeks after policy makers fixed the currency lower for the
first time in six days.  The People’s Bank of China set the reference rate 0.11
percent weaker at 6.3996 per dollar, from a record 6.3925
yesterday. The  Shanghai  Composite Index of shares and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell after European leaders failed
to provide specific direction on plans for arresting the
region’s debt crisis, damping the outlook for Asia’s exports.  “The market was left quite disappointed by the lower yuan
fixing,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist in
Singapore at Westpac Banking Corp. “The market is really
looking for some fiscal unity in  Europe  at the moment as a way
of shoring up the euro’s long-term survival. That’s why we see
equity markets come under pressure.”  The yuan dropped 0.07 percent to 6.3871 per dollar as of
5:21 p.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. That was the biggest decline since Aug. 4. The
currency reached 6.3820 yesterday, the strongest level since the
country unified official and market exchange rates at the end of
1993. In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan strengthened 0.02
percent to 6.3685.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slid 0.09 percent to
6.2812 per dollar in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The premium to the onshore spot rate was 1.7 percent,
up from a two-year low of 0.4 percent on Aug. 9.  China’s economic growth may slow to 9.2 percent in the
third quarter from 9.5 percent in the previous three months,
China Securities Journal reported on Aug. 16, citing the State
Information Center.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy rejected an expansion of the 440 billion-euro
($633 billion) rescue fund yesterday and rebuffed calls for
joint euro borrowing to end the debt crisis, saying greater
economic integration was needed first.  Chinese Vice Premier  Li Keqiang  pledged a 20 billion yuan
($3.1 billion) quota for qualified foreign companies to invest
in domestic Chinese securities yesterday and said sales of yuan
bonds in Hong Kong will be expanded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
