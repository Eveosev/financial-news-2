The  National Football League 
postponed its supplemental draft, which was scheduled for today.  The NFL didn’t give a reason for the delay and has yet to
set a new date,  Greg Aiello , a spokesman for the league, said in
an e-mail last night.  The supplemental draft is for players whose college
eligibility changed after the April draft.  It isn’t clear whether former Ohio State University
quarterback Terrelle Pryor, who was at the heart of a scandal
that led to the school’s football team vacating all of its wins
last season, will be eligible.  So far, the NFL has said four players can enter: running
back Caleb King, the University of Georgia’s leading rusher last
season; Northern Illinois safety Tracy Wilson; Western Carolina
defensive back Torez Jones; and Lindenwood University defensive
end Keenan Mace.  Pryor was one of five Ohio State football players suspended
by the  National Collegiate Athletic Association  in December for
five 2011 games for selling team memorabilia to a tattoo shop
owner. Ohio State on July 26 ruled Pryor ineligible for the
whole 2011 campaign because he didn’t cooperate with a
subsequent investigation into the football program.  Pryor, 22, left college in June, a week after coach  Jim Tressel  resigned, having won three straight Big Ten titles as
the Buckeyes’ quarterback.  In considering Pryor’s petition to enter the supplemental
draft, the NFL is looking at what occurred since April’s draft
that changed his eligibility status, including the school’s
decision to ban him for the season after he left.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
