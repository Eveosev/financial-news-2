Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , France’s second-
largest bank by assets, will relocate its regional headquarters
out of Bahrain following the unrest in the kingdom earlier this
year, two bankers familiar with the matter said.  The French bank will move most of the 75 to 100 Bahrain-
based employees into the Dubai International Financial Centre
early next year, one of the bankers said, declining to be
identified because the matter is private. A spokeswoman for
 Credit Agricole  in  London  declined to comment on the plans.  Protests in Bahrain in February and March left 20 people
dead, hurt tourism and spurred the central bank to cut its
forecasts for economic growth this year by two percentage points
to 3 percent.  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service
also reduced the country’s credit ratings.  Bahrain canceled a rescheduled Formula One race in June
after teams complained, citing travel disruption and problems
getting insurance.  Dubai set up the DIFC in 2004 with its own regulations and
an international stock market to attract overseas banks, asset
managers and insurers to help diversify its economy.  Reuters reported the plan earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
