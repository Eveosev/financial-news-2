South Sudanese President Salva Kiir
fired the head of the  Supreme Court  and the governor of the
 central bank , a month after the nation gained independence.  Kiir didn’t give reasons for the move in the decrees
published yesterday on the Juba-based South Sudanese
government’s website. The presidential decrees, issued on Aug.
15, took effect the same day, according to the published
documents.  The former governor of the Bank of South Sudan, Elijah
Malok, was replaced by a deputy, Kornelio Koryom Manyiik, while
Chan Reec Madut will take over as the head of South Sudan’s
Supreme Court from John Woul Makec, according to the decrees.  South Sudan was declared independent on July 9, after
almost 99 percent of its voters chose to secede from Sudan in a
January referendum. At independence, South Sudan gained control
of about 375,000 barrels a day of oil, close to 75 percent of
the former Sudan’s total output, which was the third-biggest in
sub-Saharan  Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
