An Italian minister threatened to
propose doubling the government’s “solidarity tax” for soccer
players in the country after they criticized the surcharge
included in the Cabinet’s austerity package.  “If they continue to threaten strikes or retaliation, I’ll
propose that soccer players pay a double extra tax,” Roberto Calderoli, Minister for Legislative Simplification, said today
in an interview with daily  la Repubblica . His spokesman
confirmed the comments.  Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s Cabinet on Aug.
13 approved 45.5 billion euros ($64 billion) in deficit cuts and
higher taxes. The highest earners will pay an extra 5 percent
tax on income over 90,000 euros a year and 10 percent on income
of more than 150,000 euros.  Players in  Italy  are asking their clubs to pay the tax
because their contracts are based on net salaries.  The players’
union already is threatening a strike if a labor agreement with
the Italian Soccer Federation isn’t reached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
