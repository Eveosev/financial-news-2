Japanese stock futures fell as the
yen approached a post-World War II high against the dollar,
hurting the outlook for overseas earnings at Asian exporters.
Australian futures dropped.  American depositary receipts of Nissan Motor Co., a
Japanese carmaker that gets a third of its revenue in  North
America , fell 0.6 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo.
Those of Sony Corp.,  Japan ’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, dropped 0.5 percent. ADRs of Telstra Corp.,
Australia’s biggest telephone company, fell 0.8 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September were bid in the premarket at 9,020 in Osaka, Japan at
8:05 a.m. local time compared with 9,040 in both Chicago and
Osaka yesterday. Japanese stocks fell yesterday for the first
time in three days. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
slid 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2
percent in Wellington.  “People are trying to identify what measures will be taken
while sentiment is worsening globally, so the market will lack
direction,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600
million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
“Concerns persist that the yen may strengthen further.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2
percent today. In  New York , the  S&P 500  added 0.1 percent to
1,193.89 yesterday. About 18 stocks fell for every 17 that rose
on U.S. exchanges as Dell Inc. forecast weaker sales and two
Federal Reserve officials expressed concern about the amount of
stimulus being applied to the economy.  Fed Criticism  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s pledge last week
to keep  interest rates  near zero until mid-2013 was
“inappropriate policy at an inappropriate time,”  Charles Plosser , president of the Fed Bank of Philadelphia, said
yesterday in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance”
with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. Dallas President Richard Fisher
said the central bank shouldn’t enact policy to protect stock
investors. Both officials dissented from the Fed’s Aug. 9
statement.  Wholesale costs in the U.S. rose more than forecast in
July. The 0.2 percent advance in the producer prices index
followed a 0.4 percent drop in June, Labor Department figures
showed. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News was for a 0.1 percent increase. The so-called core measure,
which excludes volatile food and energy, climbed 0.4 percent,
the most since January.  The yen appreciated to 76.45 yen today and touched 76.41
after the stock market closed yesterday in  Tokyo , approaching
its post-World War II high of 76.25 yen reached on March 17. A
stronger yen hurts Japanese exporters because it cuts the value
of overseas sales.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with drops of 5.1 percent by the S&P
500 and 13.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.5 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 12 times for the S&P 500 and 9.8 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
