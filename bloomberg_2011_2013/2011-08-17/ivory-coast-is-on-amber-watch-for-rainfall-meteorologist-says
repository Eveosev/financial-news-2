Ivory Coast , the world’s top cocoa
producer, is on “amber watch” for possible rains that may hurt
the upcoming bean crop, British Weather Services said.  Rains and thunderstorms that have mostly affected areas
west of the country, including Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-
Bissau, might expand into west-central Africa, said Jim Dale, a
senior risk meteorologist at British Weather Services in High
Wycombe,  England . A possible “high-volume rainfall” in Ivory
Coast at this time of year is “unusual,” according to Dale.  “We’ve got a watch on this area,” he said by phone today.
“It’s not red, it’s amber, simply because of what’s going on in
terms of these particular extra-tropical downpours that are
occurring, and whether or not we’ll see them slide into the
sensitive areas of Ivory Coast and  Ghana  that could affect the
crop.”  Ghana is the second-biggest producer of the chocolate
ingredient.  To contact the reporter on this story:
