Cedar Holdings Ltd. is selling about
$200 million worth of shares in Shin Corp. Pcl, according to a
termsheet for the sale obtained by Bloomberg.  Cedar is selling 169 million shares at 35.50 baht to 37.25
baht each, a discount of as much as 11 percent to the stock’s
closing price yesterday, the terms show. The sale includes a so-
called upsize-option to sell about a further $100 million of
shares, the terms show.  Cedar and Aspen Holdings bought 38.6 percent and 11 percent
of Shin Corp. for 49.25 baht per share in January 2006.
Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte. owned 49 percent of Cedar when
that purchase took place, according to a press release at the
time. The statement described Aspen as an indirect wholly owned
unit of Temasek.  Jeffrey Fang , Temasek’s spokesman declined to comment.  Morgan Stanley is a sole bookrunner for the sale, the terms
show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
