A federal appeals court rejected a
settlement between publishers, including  New York Times Co. (NYT) , and
freelance writers who accused the companies of copyright
infringement.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in New York vacated a lower court
order approving the agreement, finding a group of freelance
authors with certain claims weren’t adequately represented,
according to a decision filed today.  “We conclude that the district court abused its discretion
in certifying the class and approving the settlement, because
the named plaintiffs failed to adequately represent the
interests of all class members,” the appeals panel said.  The writers claimed in a class-action, or group, lawsuit
that publishers violated their copyrights by electronically
reproducing and posting their work in databases. A judge in 2005
approved the settlement, which was valued at as much as $18
million for the writers.  Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokeswoman for Times Co., didn’t
immediately comment on the appeals court ruling. Patrick Kerr, a
spokesman for Reed Elsevier Inc., another publisher in the case,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  The appeals court case is In re Literary Works In
Electronic Databases Copyright Litigation, 05-5943, 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
