Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is likely to invest about
$1 billion in Sharp Corp.’s Kameyama factory in  Japan  to secure
supply of displays for iPhones and iPads, MF Global FXA
Securities Ltd. said in a sales note today.  “This would have a material impact on Sharp’s
profitability,” according to the note. “We expect positive
news flow to come out over the next few months.”  In December, the Nikkei newspaper reported that Sharp would
invest about 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion) to build a new
display production line for Apple, which would mainly shoulder
the cost. The newspaper reported June 2 that Sharp plans to
increase its production at the Kameyama No. 2 plant after
receiving orders from Apple.  Calls to Sharp offices in Tokyo and  Osaka  went unanswered
amid the Obon vacation in Japan. Apple, in an e-mail, declined
to comment on speculation.  Sharp gained 1.8 percent to 639 yen at the 3 p.m. close in
Tokyo trading. The benchmark Topix index fell 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
