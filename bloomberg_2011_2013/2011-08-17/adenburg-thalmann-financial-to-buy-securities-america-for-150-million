Ladenburg Thalmann Financial
Services Inc. (LTS) , the Miami-based investment bank and brokerage,
agreed to buy Securities America Inc. from  Ameriprise Financial
Inc. (AMP)  for at least $150 million to add 1,700 financial advisers.  The deal, which is expected to close by the end of the
year, will add about $450 million in annual revenue for
Ladenburg, the company said in a statement today. Ladenburg will
pay $150 million in cash with the potential for additional
payments if Securities America hits performance targets in 2012
and 2013. Jim Nagengast, chief executive officer of Securities
America, will continue to run the La Vista, Nebraska-based
company as a stand-alone business.  “Ladenburg will significantly increase its market share in
the independent advisory space,” Richard Lampen, Ladenburg’s
CEO, said in the statement. “Ladenburg has a track record of
success with its past broker-dealer acquisitions, Investacorp
and Triad, by keeping those businesses truly independent.”  The two companies together will have about 2,700
independent financial advisers and about $70 billion in client
assets. Ben Pratt, a spokesman for Minneapolis-based Ameriprise
Financial, didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
