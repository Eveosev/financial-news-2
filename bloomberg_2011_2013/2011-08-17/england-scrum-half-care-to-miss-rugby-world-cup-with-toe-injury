England scrum-half  Danny Care  will
miss the Rugby World Cup with a toe injury, the Rugby Football
Union said in a statement.  Care will undergo surgery this week after sustaining the
injury to his left big toe joint in a match against Wales four
days ago. His recovery is expected to take at least six weeks,
ruling him out of the initial 30-man World Cup squad that will
be announced Aug. 22, the RFU said.  England plays its final warm-up match Aug. 27 in Ireland.
It opens the World Cup in  New Zealand  on Sept. 10 against
Argentina.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
