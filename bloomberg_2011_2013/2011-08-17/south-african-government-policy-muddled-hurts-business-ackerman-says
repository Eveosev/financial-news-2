Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK)  Chairman
Gareth Ackerman said South Africa’s “muddled policy
environment” is making it difficult for companies to operate in
the country with any degree of certainty.  The debate on taking land without compensation from white
farmers is undermining investor confidence while making it more
difficult for emerging black farmers to raise capital, Ackerman
said in the text of a speech to be presented to the  Cape Town 
Press Club in the city today. South Africa can’t afford to
“alienate foreign investors,” he said.  The country is “crying out” for more flexible labor laws
to create jobs, Ackerman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
