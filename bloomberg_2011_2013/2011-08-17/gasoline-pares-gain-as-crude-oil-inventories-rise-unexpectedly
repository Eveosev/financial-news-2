Gasoline extended gains after the
Energy Department reported stockpiles fell more than forecast
last week.  The government said inventories sank 2.8 million barrels to
208.6 million in the week ended Aug. 26. The median estimate of
14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 1.05
million-barrel drop.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 3.57 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.0315 a gallon at 10:33 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices were $3.0234 before the reportâ€™s
release at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Stockpiles of heating oil and diesel rose 363,000 barrels
to 156.1 million in the seven days ended Aug. 26. Analysts
forecast a 550,000-barrel increase, according to the survey.  September-delivery heating oil gained 0.56 cent to $3.0748
a gallon, from $3.0746 before the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
