Brazil ’s economy shrank in June for
the first time since the global financial crisis of 2008. Yields
fell as traders increased bets that the central bank will cut
 interest rates  this year.  Economic activity, a proxy for gross domestic product, fell
0.26 percent in June from the previous month, according to the
central bank’s seasonally adjusted index, from revised growth of
0.05 percent in May. The contraction was greater than the -0.05
percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  “This reinforces the thesis that the economy is slowing,
as the central bank expected,” said  Newton Rosa , chief
economist at SulAmerica Investimentos. “The market is buying
the idea that a cut may be on the way in the coming months.”  Slower world growth is driving down commodities prices and
curbing inflation expectations, leading traders to bet that
Brazilian policy makers will cut interest rates by a quarter
point by year-end. The yield on the interest rate futures
contract maturing in January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo 
today, fell nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to
11.78 percent at 1:00 p.m. New York time.  As recently as July 15, Bloomberg estimates based on
interest rate future yields suggested that central bank would
raise borrowing costs for the sixth time this year on Aug. 31 to
bring annual inflation down from a six-year high.  Demand, Growth  Rosa said he is still not forecasting an early cut given
that domestic demand remains “strong,” and the deceleration
has been limited to the industrial sector.  Activity was up 2.93 percent from the same month a year
ago, according to the non-seasonally adjusted series.  Job growth in July was lower than all 10 forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. Industrial production fell 1.6
percent in June, the second-biggest drop in output since 2008,
and business confidence in the second quarter fell to its lowest
level since 2009.  Economists expect growth to slow to 3.93 percent this year,
according to the median forecast in an Aug. 12 central bank
survey, down from a forecast of 4 percent at the start of June.
Last year the economy expanded 7.5 percent, its fastest pace in
more than two decades.  Brazil’s economy will grow more slowly than those of
Russia, India and  China , the other so-called BRIC countries,
between 2011 and 2014, according to forecasts from the
 International Monetary Fund .  Inflation Target  Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its 2011 GDP growth forecast for
Brazil to 3.6 percent from 3.8 percent, in a report distributed
today. Nomura also trimmed its 2012 GDP forecast to 3.55 percent
from 3.7 percent.  Since April, inflation has exceeded the 6.5 percent upper
limit of the bank’s target range. Consumer prices rose 6.87
percent in July from a year earlier, the fastest pace in six
years. The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus
or minus two percentage points. Central bank President Alexandre Tombini has repeatedly said that policy makers aim to slow
inflation to the mid-point of the target by 2012.  Economists cut their 2011 and 2012 inflation forecasts for
a second straight week in the most recent central bank survey.
Consumer prices will rise 5.23 next year, down from a forecast
of 5.27 percent the previous week, the survey found.  To contact the reporters on this story:
