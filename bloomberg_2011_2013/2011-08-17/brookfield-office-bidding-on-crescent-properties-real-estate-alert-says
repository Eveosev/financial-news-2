Brookfield Office Properties is
bidding for six buildings formerly owned by Crescent Real Estate
Equities Co., Real Estate Alert said.  Barclays Plc, which took over the office properties in 2009
after a Morgan Stanley real estate fund defaulted on loans
associated with them, is marketing the buildings through
brokerage HFF Inc., the newsletter said, citing “market pros”
it didn’t name. The 4.25 million-square-foot (395,000-square-
meter) Greenway Plaza in Houston represents about half the
portfolio, according to Real Estate Alert.  Brookfield, owner of  New York ’s World Financial Center, is
one of a few bidders who made offers for all the properties,
which are collectively worth more than $1 billion, according to
the newsletter. Shorenstein Properties of San Francisco bid
specifically for Greenway Plaza, Real Estate Alert said.  Kristen Calmes, a Brookfield spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the newsletter’s report.  Morgan Stanley bought  Fort Worth , Texas-based Crescent in
2007, near the peak of real estate values. Other buildings in
the portfolio are in  Las Vegas , Denver and Fort Worth, the
newsletter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
