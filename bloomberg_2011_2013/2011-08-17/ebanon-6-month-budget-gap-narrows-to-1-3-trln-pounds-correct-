(Corrects item that originally appeared yesterday to show
 budget deficit  narrowed, not widened.)  Lebanon’s budget deficit narrowed in
the first six months as telecommunications ministry revenue,
blocked in the previous government because of political
bickering, was transferred to the treasury.  The deficit narrowed to 1.3 trillion Lebanese pounds ($863
million) from 1.37 trillion pounds in the same period last year,
the Ministry of Finance said in an e-mailed statement today.
Revenue fell 2.6 percent to 5.16 trillion pounds.  The deficit would have been larger had a 1 trillion-pound
transfer of revenue from the telecommunications ministry to the
treasury not taken place.  Allocations for the government-run power company
Electricite du Liban, which provides more than 90 percent of the
country’s electricity, increased 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
