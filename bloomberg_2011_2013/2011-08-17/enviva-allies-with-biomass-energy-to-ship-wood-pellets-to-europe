Enviva LP, a supplier of processed
biomass fuel in  Europe  and the U.S., will partner with Biomass
Energy LLC to expand Virginia’s largest chip and pellet plant.  The two will jointly operate Biomass Energy’s factory in
Bumpass, Virginia, producing more than 350,000 metric tons of
wood pellets over three years, Enviva said in a  statement , with
part of the supply exported to its utility customers in Europe.  The companies are reacting to “growing worldwide demand”
for wood pellets, according to the statement. Utilities are
firing some  power plants  with biomass to benefit from government
incentives for burning renewable fuel, and cut reliance on coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
