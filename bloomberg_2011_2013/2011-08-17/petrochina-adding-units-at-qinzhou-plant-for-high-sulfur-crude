PetroChina Co. started building
refining units at its Qinzhou plant in Guangxi province to
process crude with a higher sulfur content, said a plant
official.  PetroChina will add units including hydrotreaters for
gasoline and diesel to allow the refinery to process the so-
called sour-crude grades, Wang Fengzhang, director of the news
department at the refinery, said by telephone from Qinzhou city
today.  The 200,000 barrel-a-day plant, that started operating last
year, was originally designed to process Sudan crude, a lower-
sulfur grade. It currently processes more than ten grades of
low-sulfur oil, according to Wang.  The upgrade will cost about 7 billion yuan ($1.1 billion)
and will be completed by the end of 2012, the local newspaper
 Guangxi Daily  reported today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
