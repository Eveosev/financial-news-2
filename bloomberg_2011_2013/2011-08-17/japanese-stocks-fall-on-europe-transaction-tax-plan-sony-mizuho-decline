Japanese stocks fell for the first
time in three days as European leaders said they won’t expand a
fund to end the region’s debt crisis and U.S. housing starts
dropped, reviving concern exporters’ earnings will be curbed.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, lost 1.5
percent after French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  rejected a plan to expand the rescue
fund at a meeting in Paris.  Inpex Corp. (1605) ,  Japan ’s biggest energy
exploration company, declined 3 percent as crude oil fell
yesterday.  Sumco Corp. (3436) , a maker of silicon wafers, tumbled 5.1

sluggish consumer demand.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gave up 0.6 percent to

oversees about $104 billion.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.2 percent
today. In  New York , the index fell 1 percent to 1,192.76
yesterday as the German and French leaders rejected selling euro
bonds and expanding the 440 billion-euro ($633 billion) rescue
fund. The leaders also proposed resubmitting a financial-
transaction tax that was rejected in 2010.  The Paris meeting “confirmed debt issues cannot be
resolved in a short period of time,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an
equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  European Growth  Exporters declined after reports showed economic growth in
Europe and the U.S. is slowing, hurting the outlook for overseas
earnings. Toyota lost 44 yen to 2,855 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s
biggest exporter of consumer electronics, slid 0.8 percent to
1,687 yen. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest carmaker, sank
2.5 percent to 2,552 yen.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area expanded
0.2 percent in the second quarter from the previous three
months, when the economy grew 0.8 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said in a statement yesterday.
That’s the weakest growth since the euro region emerged from a
recession in late 2009 and was less that the 0.3 percent median
estimate of 34 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Housing Starts  In the U.S., housing starts fell 1.5 percent in July from
June, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Building
permits, a proxy for future construction, also dropped.  “The U.S. housing numbers were not strong, and that
signals a slowdown in the  U.S. economy  may persist,” SMBC Nikko
Securities’ Nishi said.  Resource companies had the biggest drop among the 33
industry groups in the Topix as  oil prices  fell yesterday. Inpex

including copper and aluminum dropped 0.5 percent.  Semiconductor-related stocks fell after Dell, the second-
largest personal computer maker in the U.S., missed analysts’
sales estimates and cut its revenue forecast, hurt by sluggish
spending on desktop computers and consumer technology.  Dell Sales  Second-quarter sales rose less than 1 percent to $15.7
billion, Texas-based Dell said yesterday in a statement.
Analysts had estimated revenue of $15.8 billion in the period,
which ended July 29, according to Bloomberg data. The company
now expects sales growth of between 1 percent and 5 percent this
year, down from a previous range of 5 percent to 9 percent.  Sumco plunged 54 yen to 996 yen, the lowest close since

semiconductor maker, declined 2.7 percent to 534 yen, a level
not seen since November 2009.  Sumco declined also after UBS AG cut its stock price
estimate to 1,100 yen from 1,600 yen because of weakening
earnings on lower sales volume of semiconductor wafers and
falling prices of solar cell wafers, according to a report dated
yesterday.  Among stocks that rose, general contractors advanced as
JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its rating on the sector’s shares,
saying major contractors will receive orders to clear rubble
from the March earthquake.  Kajima Corp. (1812) , Japan’s biggest general contractor by
revenue, increased 3 percent to 238 yen.  Taisei Corp. (1801) , the
third-largest, climbed 4.3 percent to 195 yen.  Obayashi Corp. (1802) ,
