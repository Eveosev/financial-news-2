Wynton Marsalis has brought his
trumpet across the pond for a five-night residency.  Fans are packing into intimate  Ronnie Scott’s  for the
Marsalis Quintet’s two shows a night. The Pulitzer and multiple
Grammy winner is blasting through his swing jazz hits to a
rapturous reception.  47 Frith Street, W1D 4HT, through Aug. 20. Shows at 7:30
p.m. and 10 p.m. Limited tickets left.  Information:  http://www.wyntonmarsalis.org/  or
 http://www.ronniescotts.co.uk  or +44-20-7439-0747.  Frith Street is turning into a destination for food lovers,
lured by Arbutus, Barrafina, Bar Shu and Koya, all of which are
good. For a taste of old Soho, Quo Vadis may be an even better
bet. The restaurant was founded in 1926 -- the year before the
late club owner Ronnie Scott was born.  Information:  http://bit.ly/nltQB  or +44-20-7437-9585.  Saturday  Queen Elizabeth II  wears a strained smile and a diamond
crown as she poses for  Lucian Freud .  Freud, who died last month at age 88, is pictured from the
back in his dingy atelier, standing at a well-worn, rust-colored
easel. The photograph by David Dawson is part of the
government’s art collection and currently hanging in the
Whitechapel Gallery; it usually lives in Deputy Prime Minister
 Nick Clegg ’s office, one of his personal picks.  The Freud picture itself was described as “an insulting
daub” and “a travesty” by British newspapers.  Another cabinet curator, Minister for Culture Ed Vaizey,
has chosen monoprints by Tracey Emin -- two with no lewd
content, depicting the coastal town of Margate. It’s where Emin
grew up, and where Vaizey spent summers as a kid.  “Government Art Collection at Work” ends Sept. 4 at the
Whitechapel Gallery, 77-82 Whitechapel High Street, E1 7QX.

+44-20-7522-7888.  Chef  Angela Hartnett  now oversees the Whitechapel Gallery
Dining Room, worth a visit in itself. Hartnett champions
seasonal dishes with maximum flavor and minimum fuss, and her
menu is a match for any restaurant in the area. Information:

the show-stealers in “Shrek: The Musical.”  Now in  London  after a year on Broadway, “Shrek” focuses
on the improbable pairing of a grouchy, green-faced ogre (Nigel
Lindsay) and the princess he involuntarily rescues (Amanda Holden, a judge on the “Britain’s Got Talent” show).  Expect plenty of burps and bodily noises at the Drury Lane
Theatre. Information:  http://www.shrekthemusical.co.uk  or
+44-844-871-8810.  Sunday  It’s your last chance to see  Charlie Chaplin ’s daughter get
sawed in half.  Victoria Chaplin and her husband Jean-Baptiste Thierree
weave freaky tricks, tightrope walks and costumes into their
“Invisible Circus” -- not to mention a cute colony of rabbits
and ducks.  “Le Cirque Invisible” ends Sunday with the 2:30 p.m.
performance at Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre, Belvedere
Road, SE1 8XX. Information:  http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk  or
