Billionaire investor  George Soros 
said a collapse of the euro may spark a global financial crisis
in a “new Great Depression,”  L’Hebdo  magazine reported, citing
an interview.  “It seems to me that one still doesn’t understand what
would happen if the euro collapsed,” Soros told the Swiss
magazine in an e-mailed pre-release of tomorrow’s edition. “It
would lead to a banking crisis that would be totally out of
control.”  He also said  Europe ’s future hinges on Germany, which
should “dictate its solution” to the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
