Canadian stocks rose, led by
financial and precious-metals stocks, as companies including
Target Corp. and A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S reported earnings that
beat their average analyst estimates and gold gained.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ,  Canada ’s third-largest lender by
assets, advanced 1.2 percent as bank stocks erased their losses
for the month.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) , the country’s third-biggest
gold producer, increased 2.9 percent as the metal climbed for a
third day.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX) , Canada’s
largest drugmaker, surged 5.2 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 48.9
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,579.61.  “The Canadian market has been pretty resilient to a lot of
the fears and concerns out there, especially the problems in
 Europe  and debt-ceiling issue in the U.S.,” Gerry Brockelsby, a
 money manager  at Marquest Asset Management Inc. in Toronto, said
in a telephone interview. The firm oversees C$250 million ($255
million). “It’s not a direct hit on our banking system.”  The S&P/TSX declined 3.2 percent this month through
yesterday, the least among major developed-market stock
benchmarks. Besides the rebound in bank shares, gold stocks
surged on concern over U.S. and European sovereign debt.  The eight S&P/TSX banks advanced. Scotiabank rallied 1.2
percent to C$54.01.  Bank of Montreal (BMO) , the country’s fourth-
largest lender by assets, increased 1.2 percent to C$60.24.
 Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  North America ’s fourth-biggest
insurer, rose 1.6 percent to C$13.92.  Wholesale Inflation  Precious-metals producers climbed as the U.S. Dollar Index
slipped to an August low and the U.S. reported higher wholesale
inflation for July than most economists had forecast.  Kinross gained 2.9 percent to C$16.45.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the
world’s second-largest gold producer by market value, advanced
1.1 percent to C$50.30.  Lake Shore Gold Corp. (LSG) , which mines in Ontario, soared 6
percent to C$2.30 to extend its two-day surge to 18 percent, the
most since June 2009. The company reported a new discovery
yesterday.  Claude Resources Inc. (CRJ) , the owner of the Seabee mine
in Saskatchewan, jumped 18 percent, the most since October 2009,
to C$1.94 after disclosing exploration results.  Valeant rallied 5.2 percent to C$41.24. The shares have
rebounded 8.5 percent since Aug. 5, the day after the company
reported second-quarter net income that trailed analysts’
forecasts, as at least seven insiders bought shares.  Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd., the waste-management
company formerly known as  IESI-BFC Ltd. (BIN) , surged 6.8 percent, the
most since April 2010, to C$21.11 after saying it will buy back
shares. The company based in Vaughan, Ontario, will buy up to 4
million shares in the year beginning Aug. 19.  Neo Material Technologies Inc. (NEM) , which makes rare-earths and
zirconium products, increased 6.6 percent to C$9.55. The shares
have climbed 34 percent since Aug. 8 after closing at the lowest
level relative to earnings since March 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
