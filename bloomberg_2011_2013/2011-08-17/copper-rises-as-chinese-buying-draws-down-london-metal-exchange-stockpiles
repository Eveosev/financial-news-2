Copper advanced as Chinese buying
continued to draw down inventories at  London  Metal Exchange
warehouses.  Three-month copper on the LME rose as much as 1 percent to
$8,920 per metric ton, and was at $8,875 by 3:01 p.m. Shanghai
time. Copper for November delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange closed 0.5 percent higher at 66,800 yuan ($10,455) per
ton.  Copper inventories tracked by the LME around the world had
fallen three consecutive weeks to 461,775 tons as of Aug. 12.
Stockpiles in  Asia  yesterday dropped to 173,575 tons, the lowest
level since April.  “The reason why copper was able to find support at the
current level during the market turmoil in the last two weeks is
because of Chinese buying,” said  Pang Ying , an analyst at
Shenzhen Rongtuo Trading Co. Purchasing was spurred after prices
dipped below $9,000 a ton, Pang said.  Three-month copper in London tumbled to an eight-month low
of $8,446.25 a ton on Aug. 9 on concerns that a downgrade of the
U.S. long-term credit rating by  Standard & Poor’s  and contagion
from the European debt crisis may cause the global economic
recovery to falter.  One of the more positive outcomes from the LME price
declines has been a reinvigoration of Chinese spot market
buying, said a report by  Barclays Capital  yesterday. This has
been evident from price trends, with the physical premium for
cathode rising from $70-90 per ton to $90-110 per ton, according
to the report.  Arbitrage trading by buying the metal in London and selling
it in Shanghai has become profitable since the beginning of this
month, prompting expectation that arrivals will rise in the next
couple of months, Pang said.  Aluminum in London dropped 0.3 percent to $2,367 and nickel
slipped 0.5 percent to $21,600 a ton. Zinc gained 0.6 percent to
$2,194 per ton, lead rose 0.5 percent to $2,367 a ton, while tin
was unchanged at $24,150 per ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
