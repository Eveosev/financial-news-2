The German government hasn’t made
good on promises to provide subsidies for fossil-fuel power
plants,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing Sven Becker, managing
director of energy trader Trianel GmbH.  The  finance ministry  transferred the issue to European
authorities in Brussels after saying in parliament that the
program can be decided on “once the framework for subsidies
laid out by the European Commission is confirmed,” the
newspaper reported.  The grants may amount to as much as 15 percent of the
projects’ investment costs, Handelsblatt added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
