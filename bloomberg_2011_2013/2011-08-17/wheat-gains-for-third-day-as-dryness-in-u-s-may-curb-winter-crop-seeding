Wheat rose for a third day in
 Chicago  on speculation hot, dry weather in the U.S. Plains may
curb seeding of winter varieties and on concern adverse weather
in  Russia  and Ukraine might hurt crops.  Dry weather in the U.S. cut soil moisture for winter-wheat
areas of the southern Plains this week, Telvent DTN Inc. said in
a forecast yesterday. A dry spell in Russia is threatening
spring wheat, corn and sunflowers in the Volga Valley, where the
worst drought in 50 years caused crop losses in 2010, the
forecaster said.  “There’s some uncertainty about winter-wheat acreage,”
said Kieran Walsh, a broker at GFI Group Inc. in London. “There
are some minor quality concerns with the Ukrainian and Russian
crops. It’s a mixed picture on yields across the EU.”  Wheat for December delivery gained 5.25 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $7.5725 a bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The grain reached $7.60, the highest
level since Aug. 3, after climbing for a third week last week.  Much of  Texas , western  Oklahoma  and southwest Kansas are
suffering from “exceptional”  drought , the most severe rating
given by the University of Nebraska at Lincoln’s U.S. Drought
Monitor. Sowing of hard, red winter wheat, grown in the Great
Plains and used to make bread, usually begins in September and
is the largest variety of the grain grown in the U.S.  “Hotter, drier weather is the main concern for the U.S.
winter-wheat crop,” said Han Sung Min, a broker at Korea
Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul . “If drought persists, we
may see a drop in planting acres for the U.S. crop.”  Milling Wheat  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris added 1.25 euros, or 0.6 percent, to 200.25 euros
($289.10) a metric ton.  Corn for December delivery rose 1.25 cents, or 0.2 percent,
to $7.2875 a bushel in Chicago after advancing 1 percent
yesterday. Soybeans for November delivery gained 5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $13.545 a bushel.  Corn output this year will total 12.914 billion bushels,
compared with 13.47 billion projected in July and 12.447 billion
harvested in 2010, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said last
week. Inventories will total 714 million bushels when the next
marketing year ends on Aug. 31, 2012, compared with 870 million
forecast in July and 940 million expected this year, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
