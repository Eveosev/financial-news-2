Malaysia ’s ringgit closed near its
highest level in two weeks, on speculation that policy makers
will favor currency appreciation, to further tame inflation.  Government data released after the market closed, showed
consumer prices rose 3.4 percent in July, lower than the median
3.5 percent estimated by economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
Malaysia’s central bank said in a statement gross domestic
product grew 4.0 percent in the second quarter from a year
earlier. This was faster than the median 3.6 percent projected
by economists in a separate Bloomberg poll.  “Though consumer prices came in slower than expected,  Bank
Negara  may allow the ringgit to appreciate further to rein in
inflationary inflation,” Manokaran Mottain, an economist at
Kuala Lumpur-based AmResearch Sdn. said in an interview. “The
ringgit should reach 2.93 per dollar by the end of this year.”  The currency gained 0.4 percent to 2.9730 per dollar as of
6:04 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It lost 0.1 percent yesterday after gaining 1.7
percent in the previous five days.  The ringgit reached an intraday low of 2.9865 earlier
trading after Germany and France said they will propose a
financial transaction tax, raising concern efforts to address
 Europe ’s crisis will thwart global growth.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area rose 0.2
percent from the first quarter, less than the 0.3 percent median
of estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  and French President Nicolas Sarkozy also rejected
euro bonds and expanding the 440 billion-euro ($633 billion)
rescue fund.  Malaysian  government bonds  gained. The yield on the 4.262
percent note due September 2016 dropped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, at 3.40 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
