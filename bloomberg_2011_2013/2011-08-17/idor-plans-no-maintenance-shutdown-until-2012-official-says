Middle East Oil Refinery SAE, an
Egyptian crude refiner, said it plans no maintenance shutdowns
until the end of June 2012.  The refiner, also known as Midor, may close some units at
its complex in the coastal province of Alexandria in the second
half of next year, said a company official, who declined to be
identified in line with company policy.  Midor processes a mixture of Arabian light and heavy crude
oil. It has a capacity of 5 million tons per year, or 100,000
barrels per day, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
