Polish stock stocks declined,
reversing earlier gains, as concern European leaders will fail
to resolve the debt crisis and revive growth overshadowed gains
by commodity producers.  The WIG20 Index slipped 0.5 percent to 2,376.49 at 12:25
p.m. in Warsaw, after rising as much as 0.4 percent. The broader
WIG Index of 382 stocks fluctuated between gains and losses.  Stocks retreated from  Frankfurt  to Madrid, sending the
benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index down 0.7 percent, after German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President Nicolas Sarkozy
rejected an expansion of the region’s rescue fund and rebuffed
calls for joint euro borrowing.  “The Polish market is looking for some direction after
yesterday’s talks between Merkel and Sarkozy and we are just
fluctuating between gains and losses,” said Aleksander Mazur, a
stock trader at Espirito Santo Investment SA in Warsaw.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , majority-owned by Italy’s UniCredit SpA,
sank 2.7 percent to 137.2 zloty. PZU SA, the biggest insurer,
lost 2 percent to 346.5 zloty.  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s biggest oil company, gained 3.2
percent to 39.2 zloty, and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , the second-largest
refiner, increased 1.5 percent to 34.4 zloty. Oil rose as
investors bet that shrinking fuel stockpiles in the U.S.
indicate demand will increase in the world’s biggest crude-
consuming nation.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper producer with the biggest
European mine output, climbed 1.5 percent to 166.9 zloty,
heading for the highest close in a week. Copper advanced as
Chinese buying continued to draw down inventories at London
Metal Exchange warehouses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
