The  Federal Reserve  said it’s
conducting tri-party reverse repurchase agreements as policy
makers prepare for the eventual withdrawal of monetary stimulus.  The one-day transactions, part of a series of open-market
operations that began in 2009, don’t represent any change in
monetary policy, according to a statement posted Aug. 12 on the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website. Treasuries, agencies
and agency mortgage-backed securities will be eligible
collateral today.  Fed began expanding its counterparties to increase the
capacity for the eventual draining of reserves as primary
dealers shore up their own balance sheets after the worst
financial crisis in decades.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to its counterparties. The central bank added more than $1
trillion in extra cash to its balance sheet as part of its
effort to combat the financial crisis.  In a tri-party arrangement, a third party functions as the
agent for the transaction and holds the security as collateral.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. are the
only banks that serve in a trade-clearing capacity in the tri-
party repo market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
