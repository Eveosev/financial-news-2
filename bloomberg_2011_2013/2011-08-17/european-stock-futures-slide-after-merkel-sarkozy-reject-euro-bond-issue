European stock-index futures fell as
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas
Sarkozy  rejected an expansion of the regionâ€™s rescue fund and
rebuffed calls for joint euro borrowing. Asian shares rose,
while U.S. futures were little changed.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in September
lost 1 percent to 2,298 at 7:12 a.m. in  London .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
