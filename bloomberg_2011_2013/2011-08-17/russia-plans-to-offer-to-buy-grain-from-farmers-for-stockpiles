Russia’s  Agriculture Ministry  plans
to offer to buy grain from farmers who can buy it back at the
same price to support the market.  Farmers would have to pay for the storage if they buy back
the grain, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. The
ministry will select 120 silos in grain-producing regions for
the program, it said. Russia’s grain reserves are 6.7 million
tons, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
