Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency in the last month, gained for the
first day in three against the dollar as buyers stayed out of
the market after the currency reached an 18-year low this week.  The currency of Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer
gained 0.3 percent to 2,787.50 per dollar at 3:36 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
depreciated to as weak as 2,805 a dollar yesterday and closed at
2,795, the lowest level since June 1993.  “Demand was quite small today as people regarded the
trading levels as too high,” Timothy Muzoora, a currency trader
at Cairo Bank Ltd. said by phone from Kampala. “Importers were
not willing to buy the dollar at this level.”  The currency of East  Africa ’s third-biggest economy
depreciated 8.5 percent in the last month, and has weakened 17
percent since the beginning of the year, making it the world’s
worst-performing currency over the two periods, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more
than 18-year high of 18.7 percent in July from 15.7 percent in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
