Midwest gasoline strengthened as
inventories of the fuel in the region fell to their lowest level
since May and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  planned to shut a coker this
weekend at its Montana refinery.  Total gasoline inventories in the Midwest slipped 1.02
million barrels last week to 47.7 million, according to the
Energy Department. It’s the lowest level since May 6 and the
third consecutive drop.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the so-
called Group 3 market rose 2.25 cents to 4 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:58
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
gained 5.27 cents to $2.924 a gallon.  Exxon’s Billings refinery reported a recurring compressor
malfunction Aug. 15 that will be investigated once the coker is
shut around Aug. 20 for scheduled work, Jim Hughes, an official
with the state’s Department of Environmental Quality, said in an
e-mail yesterday.  The refinery has been operating at reduced rates since
early July after the company’s 12-inch Silvertip pipeline
ruptured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
