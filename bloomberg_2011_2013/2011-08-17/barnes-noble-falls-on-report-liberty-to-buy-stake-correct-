Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS) , the largest
U.S. bookstore chain, dropped the most in almost six months
after DealReporter said that Liberty Media Corp. may invest in
the retailer instead of buying the company.  Barnes & Noble  fell  $1.53, or 11 percent, to $12.99 at 4
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite  trading , for the
biggest drop since Feb. 22. Liberty Media declined 37 cents to
$72.57 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  Financing constraints may avert a takeover, the
DealReporter  website  said today. Liberty may instead buy
preferred shares, the paper said, citing a person familiar with
the plan.  Liberty, based in Englewood,  Colorado , offered to buy  New
York-based Barnes & Noble in May for $17 a share, valuing the
company at about $1 billion, after the retailer put itself up
for sale in August 2010. Liberty has described the deal as a
merger because Barnes & Noble Chairman Leonard Riggio will
maintain his 30 percent equity stake and a management role in
the company.  Mary Ellen Keating , a spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble,
declined to comment. Courtnee Ulrich, a spokeswoman for Liberty,
didnâ€™t return phone calls and an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
