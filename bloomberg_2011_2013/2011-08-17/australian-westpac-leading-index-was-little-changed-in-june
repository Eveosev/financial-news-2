An Australian index of leading
economic indicators was little changed in June as consumers
restrained spending.  The index, a gauge of future economic growth, advanced 0.1
percent from a month earlier to 280.1,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and
the Melbourne Institute said in a statement in Sydney today.  Westpac’s leading index tracks eight gauges of activity,
including company profits and productivity, to give an
indication of how the economy will perform over the next three
to nine months. The coincident index, a measure of the current
state of the economy, gained 0.2 percent to 265.2 in June.  Bill Evans, Westpac’s chief economist, last month
predicted the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will cut its benchmark
interest rate in December by a quarter percentage point to 4.5
percent. “The reported rise in the unemployment rate from 4.9
percent to 5.1 percent in July provides some early support for
that view,” Evans said in today’s statement.  Evans said  Australia ’s unemployment rate may rise to 5.5
percent by mid-2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
