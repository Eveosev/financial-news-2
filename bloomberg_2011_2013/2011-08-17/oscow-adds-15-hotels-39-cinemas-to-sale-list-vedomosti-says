Moscow Mayor  Sergei Sobyanin 
approved changes yesterday to the cityâ€™s asset-sale program
through 2013, adding stakes in 15 hotels and 39 movie theaters,
 Vedomosti  reported, citing a copy of the document.  The additions include OAO Gostinichnaya Kompaniya, which
was initially created to become a joint venture between U.S.
billionaire  Ronald Lauder  and the city government, the Moscow-
based newspaper reported. Plans for the joint business fell
apart after Sobyanin replaced Yury Luzhkov as mayor last year,
Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
