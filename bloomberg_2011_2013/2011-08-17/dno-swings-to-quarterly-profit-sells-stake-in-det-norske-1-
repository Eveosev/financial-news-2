DNO International ASA (DNO) , the first
foreign company to pump oil in  Iraq  since the 1970s, swung to a
profit in the second quarter and sold its stake in Det Norske
Oljeselskap ASA.  Net profit of 216.1 million kroner ($40 million), or 0.23
kroner a share, compared with a loss of 121.1 million kroner, or
0.07 kroner, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose to 732
million kroner.  “DNO International achieved strong results so far this
year,” Chief Executive Officer Helge Eide said in a statement
today. “The excellent reservoir quality of the Tawke field in
the Kurdistan Region of Iraq has been proved through stable high
production in the first half of 2011.”  The company reported the sale of its 11.66 percent stake in
oil explorer Det Norske Oljeselskap to Aker Capital AS. DNO sold
12.95 million shares of Det Norske at 40.25 kroner a share,
resulting in proceeds of 521 million kroner and an accounting
gain of 255 million kroner, which will be booked in the third
quarter.  “The reported cash position of 1.25 billion kroner at the
end of the second quarter and the additional 521 million kroner
in proceeds from the today announced sale of shares in Det
Norske Oljeselskap provides a rock solid financial platform for
further development and growth of DNO” Eide said in the
statement.  Higher Output  DNO’s working interest production rose to 48,582 barrels of
oil equivalent a day in the quarter from 15,748 barrels, it
said.  The company booked a payment of $103.7 million related to
exports from Kurdistan during February and March. No revenue
from exports from Kurdistan in the second quarter was included
in today’s financial statement as the IFRS revenue recognition
requirements have not been fulfilled, the company said.  “On a working interest basis, the export from Kurdistan
constitutes 87 percent of the production in the second quarter
and will hence have a substantial effect on the reported
financials when included,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
