Former mining-company executive
Peter Kuhn was declared a fugitive by the Environmental
Protection Agency after he failed to turn himself in for his
role in a conspiracy to illegally dispose of arsenic and lead.  Kuhn, former president of Reno, Nevada-based French Gulch
Nevada Mining Corp. and  Bullion River Gold Corp. (BLRVQ) , engaged in a
conspiracy to dump mining wastes on a hillside, county road and
stream near a company mine, the EPA said today in a statement.
If convicted, Kuhn faces a possible prison term of 20 years.  On July 1, 2010, a U.S. District Court grand jury in the
Eastern District of  California  returned an indictment charging
Kuhn with one count of conspiracy and other crimes. Kuhn, 56,
becomes the 18th  fugitive  listed by the agency, according to the
EPA’s website.  A telephone message left with French Gulch Nevada Mining
wasn’t immediately returned. A telephone number on file for Kuhn
was disconnected.  To contact the reporters on this story:
