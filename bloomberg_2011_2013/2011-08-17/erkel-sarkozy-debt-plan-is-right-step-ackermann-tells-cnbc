Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chief Executive
Officer  Josef Ackermann  said the latest Franco-German strategy
to control the euro debt crisis is a positive step even as he
criticized a proposal to tax financial transactions.  “It’s a right step in the right direction,” Ackermann
said today during an interview with CNBC. “It shows commitment
of European leaders to defend the euro and the EU.”  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy backed a plan yesterday to tax financial
institutions and to require European governments to balance
their budgets to help counter the euro debt crisis.  “What is more problematic is the revival of the
transaction tax, which I thought was really dead forever,” said
Ackermann, 63, who plans to retire from Deutsche Bank’s board
next year after a decade as head of  Germany ’s largest lender.
“The transaction tax will make it more difficult for banks to
be profitable in the Euro zone.”  Sarkozy and Merkel spoke yesterday after a two-hour meeting
in Paris as investors called for signs they would do more to end
the debt storm after reports showed an unexpected slowdown in
their economies. Unprecedented bailouts by governments and the
 European Central Bank  have failed to stamp out concerns that
began in Greece almost two years ago and rattled markets in AAA-
rated France last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
