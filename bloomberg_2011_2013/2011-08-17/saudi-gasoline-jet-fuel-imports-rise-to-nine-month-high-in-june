Saudi Arabia ’s gasoline and jet-fuel
imports advanced 41 percent in June from the previous month even
as local production rose 5 percent, government data showed.  The kingdom, the world’s largest crude exporter, imported
96,000 barrels a day of gasoline and jet fuel, compared with
68,000 barrels a day in May, according to a posting today on the
 website  of the Joint Organization Data Initiative. That’s the
highest level since September last year.  Gasoline output from Saudi refineries was 359,000 barrels a
day, up from 342,000 barrels in May, the data showed. The data
initiative is overseen by the Riyadh-based  International Energy
Forum , an organization that promotes discussions between 86
producing and consuming nations on international  energy
security .  To contact the reporter on this story:
