The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
increased 191.45, or 0.6 percent, to 30,178.72 by the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Assore Ltd. (ASR)  , a South African mine-holding company
climbed 10.25 rand, or 5 percent, to 216.25 rand, the most since
December. Earnings for the current financial year are expected
to rise to as much as 3.35 billion rand ($473.3 million) from
1.48 billion rand a year earlier.  Eqstra Holdings Ltd. (EQS)  , which imports industrial and
construction equipment, dropped the most since Aug. 8, declining
8 cents, or 1.1 percent, to 6.96 rand. The group will be
excluded from the MSCI Global Small Caps Index for  South Africa 
from the end of the month.  Optimum Coal Holdings (OPT)  Ltd, a coal producer, rose
to its highest since June 22, gaining 40 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to 27.30 rand. The company said it’s in unspecified talks,
which, if successful, may affect the price of its shares.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  , the world’s second-largest brewer
by volume, advanced to the highest since July 28, adding 5.85
rand, or 2.4 percent, to 251.90 rand. The group will take its
A$9.5 billion ($10 billion) takeover offer for Foster’s Group
Ltd. directly to shareholders, going hostile after the board
rejected the price as too low.  Super Group Ltd. (SPG SJ), a transport-services provider,
headed for its highest close in a month, rising 6 cents, or 7.6
percent, to 85 cents. Profit more than doubled to 320.4 million
rand in the year through June, it said in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
