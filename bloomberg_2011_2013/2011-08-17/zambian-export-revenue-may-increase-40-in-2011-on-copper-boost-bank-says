Zambia’s revenue from exports will
probably increase 40 percent to $10.2 billion this year from a
year earlier, with copper exports climbing 46 percent, the
country’s central bank said.  Copper export revenue is forecast to jump to $8.4 billion
from $5.77 billion in 2010 due to a higher volume of shipments
and prices, the Lusaka-based Bank of Zambia said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The southern African nation’s merchandise trade surplus
will probably widen to $4 billion from $2.55 billion, it said.
