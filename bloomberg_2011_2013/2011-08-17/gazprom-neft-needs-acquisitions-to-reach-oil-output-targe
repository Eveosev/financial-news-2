OAO Gazprom Neft, the  oil company 
controlled by  Russia ’s largest natural gas producer OAO Gazprom,
will fall short of a goal to produce 100 million metric tons of
oil equivalent a year by 2020 without acquisitions.  “The goal of 100 million tons should be realized by
entering new assets and projects both in Russia and abroad,”
Vadim Yakolev, deputy chief executive officer, said in an
interview with Prime Tass posted on the Gazprom Neft  website .
The company has a better chance of growth in Russia than abroad,
Yakolev said.  With its current assets, Gazprom Neft may increase
production to 80 million to 90 million tons, or 1.61 million to
1.81 million barrels a day, he said. That’s short of the goal to
double output to 2 million barrels a day by 2020.  Gazprom Neft plans to begin production at the SeverEnergia
project in the Yamal-Nenets region with OAO Novatek, Eni SpA and
Enel SpA next year. It aims to start output at two other
projects in the same region in 2014 and 2015, according to the
company website.  Output increases will depend on the creation of transport
infrastructure, the project partners and the geology of new
assets, Yakolev said.  Gazprom Neft increased output 8 percent to 1.13 million
barrels of oil equivalent a day in the second quarter compared
with a year earlier, according to a presentation on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
