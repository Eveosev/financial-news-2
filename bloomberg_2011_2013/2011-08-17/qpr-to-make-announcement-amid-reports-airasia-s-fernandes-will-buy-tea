Queens Park Rangers, promoted to
English soccer’s Premier League at the end of last season, said
it will make an announcement tomorrow amid speculation the team
will be bought by  Tony Fernandes , chief executive officer of
Malaysia’s  AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA)   Fernandes is set to buy 51 percent of the club from Formula
One chief  Bernie Ecclestone , according to news media including
Sky Sports.  Takeover speculation has surrounded the west London team
since Ecclestone said in April that he might sell it for 100
million pounds ($166 million). On July 28, the club said it had
started talks with a new potential buyer after discussions with
another party ended in March.  Malaysia’s Fernandes, 47, is also involved in Formula One
as the head of Team Lotus. AirAsia is the region’s biggest
listed budget carrier.  QPR crashed 4-0 at home to Bolton Wanderers in its opening
league game last weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
