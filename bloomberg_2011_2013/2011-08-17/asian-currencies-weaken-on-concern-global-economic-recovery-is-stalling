Asian currencies weakened, led by
 South Korea ’s won, after  Europe ’s economic growth almost stalled
and Singapore’s overseas shipments slumped.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index fell for a second
day after growth in the 17-nation euro zone slowed to the least
since 2009 in the second quarter, while  France  and  Germany 
rebuffed calls for bigger plans to stem the sovereign-debt
crisis. The  Singapore dollar  halted a three-day rally after
exports shrank for the first time in three months in July. The
ringgit traded between gains and losses before a central bank
report today that will probably show economic growth slowed.  “Policy makers in Europe haven’t come up with a solution
that would resolve markets so far,” said Nick Verdi, a
Singapore-based currency analyst at Barclays Capital Plc.
“Asian currencies will come under a bit of pressure today. We
are looking for quite a gentle slowing activity in Asian
economies, rather than something very sharp.”  The won fell for the first time in three days, weakening
0.1 percent to 1,071.53 per dollar as of the 3 p.m. close in
 Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Philippine
peso dropped 0.2 percent to 42.445 and the Singapore dollar
erased a 0.3 percent gain to trade little changed at S$1.2038.  Europe’s shared economy grew 0.2 percent last quarter,
trailing economists’ forecast for a 0.3 percent increase. German
Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy
rejected an expansion of the 440 billion-euro ($633 billion)
bailout fund and rebuffed calls for joint euro borrowing.  Singapore, Malaysia  Singapore’s dollar slipped from near the strongest level
since 1981 after non-oil domestic exports shrank 2.8 percent in
July from a year, compared with a 1 percent gain in June, the
trade ministry said. The city-state may slip into a “technical
recession” this quarter, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in
a report on Aug. 5.  “The risks weigh on the outlook for growth in  Singapore 
and could contain the build-up of demand-led inflation pressures
in the economy,” said Leif Eskesen, chief economist for
 Southeast Asia  and India at HSBC Holdings Plc. “In turn, this
eases the pressure on the monetary authority to tighten policies
again in October.”  Malaysia’s economy grew at an annual pace of 3.6 percent
last quarter, compared with 4.6 percent in the first three
months of 2011, according to economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. Bank Negara Malaysia will release the report at 6 p.m.
local time. The ringgit gained 0.2 percent to 2.9785, trimming a
0.3 percent advance.  China  Growth  The yuan slipped from a 17-year high, losing 0.07 percent
to 6.3873 per dollar. The People’s Bank of China set the
currency’s reference rate 0.11 percent weaker at 6.3996, halting
stronger fixing in the previous five days.  China’s economy  is slowing “significantly,” the
Conference Board, a New York-based research organization, said
yesterday. Economic growth may slow to 9.2 percent in the third
quarter from 9.5 percent the previous quarter, the China
Securities Journal reported yesterday, citing the State
Information Center.  Elsewhere,  India ’s rupee fell 0.1 percent to 45.4075 per
dollar and Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.1 percent to NT$28.962.
Thailand’s baht gained 0.1 percent to 29.87. Financial markets
in Indonesia were closed for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
