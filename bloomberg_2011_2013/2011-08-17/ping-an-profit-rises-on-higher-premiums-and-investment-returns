Ping An Insurance (Group) Co.,
 China ’s second-biggest insurer, said first-half profit rose 33
percent as premium income and investment returns expanded.  Net income climbed to 12.8 billion yuan ($2 billion), or
1.67 yuan a share, from 9.61 billion yuan, or 1.30 yuan a share,
a year earlier, the Shenzhen-based company said in a statement
to the Shanghai stock exchange today.  Net premiums rose by 39 percent as the insurer’s focus on
telemarketing and agents helped bolster revenue amid the
nation’s slower car sales and tightened regulation on selling
policies over bank counters. Net investment income, mainly
dividends and bond yields, rose 29 percent to 16.2 billion yuan,
according to the statement.  The company also reported 551 million yuan in realized and
unrealized investment gains, compared with a 2.2 billion yuan
loss a year earlier. Ping An will inject no more than 20 billion
yuan in cash into  Shenzhen Development Bank Co. (000001)  by purchasing
new shares in the banking unit to boost its capital position,
according to a separate statement.  Ping An shares were suspended today pending a “price-
sensitive” announcement. The stock fell 0.9 percent to HK$67.05
on Aug. 16. The shares have declined 23 percent this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
