Mexico ’s peso rose as a reduction in
volatility in U.S. equities markets after last week’s record
swings helped ease investor concern about the safety of
emerging-market assets.  The peso gained 0.7 percent to 12.1689 per dollar at 5 p.m.
New York time, from 12.2575 yesterday. The currency has gained
1.4 percent this year.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent erasing
most of an earlier rally, as Dell Inc. forecast weaker sales and
two  Federal Reserve  officials warned against applying too much
stimulus to the economy. Industrial output in the world’s
biggest economy climbed in July by the most this year, according
to figures from the Federal Reserve yesterday. The U.S. is
Mexico’s biggest trading partner.  “Calmer, more stable markets” help the peso strengthen,
said  Marc Chandler , global head of currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York. “The  Mexican peso  was
punished more than maybe it deserved in the market turmoil.”  The yield on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 fell 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 6.17 percent, according to
Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose 1.38 centavo
to 134.68 centavos per peso.  Mexico swapped 10 billion pesos ($822 million) of fixed-
rate debt today, the central bank said on its website. Holders
exchanged bonds due in December 2014, June 2015 and December
2015 for securities due in June 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
