Modern  India  has an embarrassing history of government  censorship . Its latest episode occurred last week when populist politics and a low tolerance for artists' inquiry of social issues combusted over the release of the film " Aarakshan ." "Aarakshan," meaning "reservation" in Hindi, is a film by producer, director and screenwriter Prakash Jha, who is one of the more socially-conscious filmmakers in Bollywood. It is about so-called reservations: Affirmative-action programs for the 160 million Dalits, the "untouchables," who make up the lowest caste in India. Caste  is a complex form of social stratification specific to India. And it remains a major source of conflict in India's democracy. The Indian Constitution, written in 1950, makes  reservation the law . Specifically, at least 22.5 percent of government jobs and seats at public education institutions are reserved for those from low castes and tribal communities. While there is still much more to do, reservation has greatly improved the lot of lower castes the past  60 years. In a concise but comprehensive summary of "Aarakshan" in The National, Suryatapa Bhattacharya  explains : In the days leading to the release of "Arakshan," some groups squabbled over whether it slandered lower castes or merely depicted the reality of upper-caste sentiments toward them. In The National,  Bhattacharya  reported  that the film "ignited protests across the country and brought criticism from politicians and low-caste minority groups." These protests and demonstrations were enough to keep the curtain down on the film in some parts of India. India’s Central Board of Film Certification -- an institution, some critics argue, that must be dismantled -- approved Jha’s film. Two separate High Courts also passed it. But on the eve of its scheduled August 12 release, three Indian state governments --  Andhra Pradesh ,  Punjab  and  Uttar Pradesh   -- banned "Aarakshan." Bhattacharya explained that the film was  banned  because: The state government officials who outlawed the film (one of them being India’s most prominent and powerful Dalit leader,  Mayawati , who governs  Uttar Pradesh ) reasoned that the film was derogatory to Dalits. By doing so, these officials suggested that artistic work dealing with controversial subjects should only be allowed to adopt the position of official textbooks. To them, "Aarakshan" was inflammatory, not inquisitive. But the decisions to ban the film were both morally patronizing and legally dubious. They also had historical precedent. Most recently, in March 2011, the government of Gujarat banned Joseph Lelyveld’s  recent biography  of Gandhi on the charge that the book slandered its subject. Today, much of middle-class India, which tends to derive from the upper and middle castes,  resents  the reservations' expanding reach over government jobs and seats in higher education. But the lower castes believe that despite the legal concessions given to them, psychologically, their place in Indian society remains unchanged. A genuine engagement between the higher castes and lower castes is yet to be seen in modern India. Early  reviews  of the film suggested that it did not offer an especially perceptive reading of the debate over reservations in public education. Although, as a form of mass entertainment, "Aarakshan" surely has the power to stimulate debate on the issue across the country -- if people can watch the film. Instead, the theme has become less about caste and more about censorship. The Hindu  reported  that the chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, P.L. Punia, stated that the premise of the film, overall, was not objectionable, but specific dialogue in "Aarakshan" was “derogatory”: Mr. Punia asked the censorhip board to order some changes to the film. But the board chairperson, Leela Samson, responded that it would "defend Mr. Jha's right to free expression." She continued, “When you show a certain situation, you must show reality as it is…  I don't think the film is anti-Dalit.” On August 13, the governments of Punjab and  Andhra Pradesh  overturned the bans after special committees they had set up to examine "Aarakshan" reported the film as being unobjectionable. This latest controversy was an example of Indian government officials' tendencies to arrogate to themselves all arbitrary powers of judgment. Columnist Kanchan Gupta, in his piece for the Pioneer, " Banning 'Aarakshan' Is a Denial of Freedom ," wrote: Various interest groups in India, too, exercise a second rung of censorship. They demand, for instance, that they also pre-screen films so that they may pass them. In Mumbai, for example, the center of India's film industry, a  group of politicians , including several prominent lower-caste leaders, attended a special advance screening of the movie . They then suggested a few cuts to the film if they were not to officially protest it. Many  other panels  across India also advised edits in order to give the film their approval. Ramdas Athawale, a Dalit leader, took the debate to a ridiculous extreme when he complained that his committee could not watch "Aarakshan" in advance. He  argued : Earlier this week, India celebrated its  64th anniversary of independence . But the mood of incomprehension, obscurantism and obstruction seen in this latest episode suggests that the autonomy of the arts and the free pursuit of inquiry are yet to gain a solid foundation. In the near future, artistic production will likely play victim to governmental paternalism, excessively sensitive religious and caste sentiments, and plain political cynicism and expediency. This is a potent cocktail of suffocation for the spirit of questioning through the arts -- a necessary element in any mature, free society.
