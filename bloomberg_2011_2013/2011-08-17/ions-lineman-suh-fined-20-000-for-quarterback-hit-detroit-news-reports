Detroit Lions defensive tackle
 Ndamukong Suh  was fined $20,000 by the  National Football League 
for a hit on Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton during
an Aug. 12 preseason game, the  Detroit News said .  Suh, 24, was the NFL’s Defensive Rookie of the Year in
2010, when he had 10 sacks and 66 tackles and was also fined
twice by the NFL for illegal hits on quarterbacks. He was fined
$7,500 for a hit on Cleveland’s Jake Delhomme during the
preseason and $15,000 for a hit on Chicago’s  Jay Cutler  during
the regular season.  Suh’s latest fine came after he grabbed Dalton around the
head and shoulders and  slammed  the rookie to the ground after an
incomplete pass. In a post on his
 Twitter feed , Suh wrote, “$20,000REALLY???” followed by more
than 100 exclamation points.  Suh, the second pick in the 2010 NFL draft, signed a
contract last year that guarantees him $40 million over his
first five NFL seasons and could pay him as much as $68 million.  “There’s always a fine line of dirtiness and a fine line
of aggressiveness,” Suh told the  Detroit Free Press  two days
after the game against Cincinnati. “I know to this point that in
my own heart I haven’t crossed that line by any means.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
