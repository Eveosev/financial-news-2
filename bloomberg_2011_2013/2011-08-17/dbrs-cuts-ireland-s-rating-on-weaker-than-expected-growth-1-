Ireland’s long-term foreign and
local currency debt was downgraded to A (Low) from A because of
deteriorating growth prospects for the nation’s economy, bond
rating company DBRS Inc. said.  The trend on the ratings “remain negative” as “downside
risks to Ireland’s export-led recovery persist,” the Toronto-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement. DBRS’s
rating, which is four steps above non-investment grade on its
scale, remains above those of  Standard & Poor’s , Moody’s
Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.  “Weaker-than-expected growth is likely to push public debt
ratios higher than previously anticipated,” DBRS said. “In our
revised baseline scenario, Ireland’s gross general government
debt peaks at 120 percent” of gross domestic product in 2013
and then declines gradually, according to the report.  Ireland sought an international bailout last year as
investors shunned government and bank debt after the economy
shrank about 15 percent since 2007. Moody’s cut Ireland below
investment grade on July 12, saying the country may need
additional official financing and that investors may need to
share in losses before it can return to the market to borrow.  Standard & Poor’s affirmed its long-term rating on Ireland
at ‘BBB+’ on Aug. 5 and said the outlook is “stable.”  Fitch
Ratings  confirmed Ireland’s ‘BBB+’ rating on April 14 and
removed it from “rating watch negative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
