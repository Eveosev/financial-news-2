Ryo Ishikawa of  Japan  has joined the
U.S. PGA Tour for the remainder of the season, getting a chance
to earn enough money to avoid qualifying school for next year.  Ishikawa, 19, accepted the special temporary member status
from the world’s richest golf tour, allowing him to accept
sponsors’ exemptions for the rest of the season and compete in
the four  Fall Series  events, beginning Sept. 29 in Las Vegas.  Ishikawa is the first player to accept such status this
season. Last year, Charl Schwartzel of  South Africa , the current
Masters Tournament champion, and Robert Karlsson of Sweden
accepted the offers.  In 10 PGA Tour events this season, Ishikawa has earned
$577,136, which puts him 116th on the  money list . The top 125
players on the list at the end of the schedule automatically get
to play on the Tour next season, while those outside 125 must
attend qualifying school where they compete over six rounds for
25 spots on the  PGA Tour . Troy Merritt finished 125th a year ago
with $786,977.  Ishikawa, who earned $473,136 two weeks ago when he tied
for fourth at the Bridgestone Invitational, is ineligible for
the Tour’s  FedEx Cup  playoff events, which begin next week at
the Barclays championship in Plainfield,  New Jersey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
