Cash premiums for corn shipped in
August to export terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to
Chicago futures on reduced demand from overseas producers of
 animal feed  and food. The soybean basis was unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 68 cents to 72 cents a bushel above September futures,
down from 73 cents to 76 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis was 59 cents to 64
cents a bushel.  “Export demand for corn is slowing because we are seeing
an overseas shift to cheaper wheat in animal feed,” Brian Basting, a market analyst for Advance Trading Inc. in
Bloomington,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview. “High
prices are rationing supplies.”  Corn futures for September delivery fell 2.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to close at $7.115 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price touched $7.205, the highest for the
contract since July 19.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 17.25 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $13.6675 a bushel on the CBOT, the fifth gain in
six sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
