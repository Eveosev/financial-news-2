What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that the
hottest July weather since 1955 in parts of the U.S. Midwest
damaged yields more than the government estimated last week,  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana,
said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that rain this week will miss fields
in parts of the central and northwestern Midwest, increasing
stress on plants, Gerlach said. Soybean-oil futures are expected
to open up 0.15 cent to 0.25 cent a pound, and soybean-meal
futures may open 50 cents to $1.50 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that wet weather during the U.S.
planting season and unusually high temperatures in July will
curb output in the northern Great Plains, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
