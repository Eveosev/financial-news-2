Crude oil rose as the dollar fell
against the euro and other currencies, increasing the investment
appeal of commodities denominated in the U.S. currency.  Futures climbed 1.1 percent as the dollar dropped against
most of its major counterparts. Oil pared gains after a U.S.
Energy Department report showed an unexpected increase in crude
oil inventories and equities retreated.  “The decline of the dollar is increasing demand for all
things priced in the currency, such as oil and gold,” said Sean Brodrick, a natural resource analyst with  Weiss Research  in
Jupiter,  Florida . “If the dollar continues to fall, you are
going to see a further rally in commodities.”  Crude oil for September delivery rose 93 cents to $87.58 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures have
increased 16 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for October settlement climbed $1.47, or 1.3
percent, to end the session at $110.60 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The dollar declined 0.3 percent to $1.4451 against the euro
at 3:16 p.m. in New York. The Dollar Index, which measures the
greenback against other major currencies, fell 0.4 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose 1 percent
to 657.22. Twenty of the commodities advanced.  Fuel Stockpiles  U.S. crude oil supplies rose 4.23 million barrels to 354
million in the week ended Aug. 12, the Energy Department said
today. Inventories were forecast to decline 500,000 barrels,
according to the median of 16 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  “We came off about a dollar after the inventory numbers,
but they weren’t bearish enough to change the direction of the
market,” said Chris Dillman, an analyst at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve is releasing
stockpiles in coordination with the Paris-based  International
Energy Agency . The Energy Department has delivered 20.4 million
barrels of oil from emergency reserves since July 17, according
to its  website . The government sold 30.64 million barrels to
companies in cooperation with the IEA.  “The crude build was an eye opener but when juxtaposed
against an SPR draw of 5.9 million, net crude declined,” said
 David Pursell , a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
LLC in Houston. “You got another draw at Cushing.”  Cushing Inventories  Crude oil stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for the New York contract, declined 893,000 barrels to
33.7 million, the lowest level since November, Energy Department
figures showed.  Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, increased 2.45 million barrels to 154
million, the highest level since March.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 3.51 million barrels to 210.1
million last week, the biggest decline since April 8. Production
of the fuel decreased 2.2 percent to 9.32 million barrels a day.
Consumption of the motor fuel fell 0.5 percent to 9.2 million
barrels in the week ended Aug. 12, down 2.8 percent from a year
earlier, the report showed.  “The drop in gasoline supplies was an example of inventory
management by refiners,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at
Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “It’s late in the driving
season and the focus of refiners is shifting to distillate fuel.
Gasoline supplies dropped because refinery output fell, not
because of rising demand.”  Refinery Use  Refinery use dropped to 89.1 percent of capacity from 90
percent. U.S. refineries boost distillate-fuel output during the
second half of the year, making diesel for farm machinery and
heating oil for winter use in the Northern Hemisphere. U.S.
gasoline demand peaks during June, July and August.  Gasoline for September delivery gained 1.65 cents, or 0.6
percent, to end the session at $2.8703 a gallon in New York.
Prices have risen 47 percent in the past year.  Iran ’s foreign minister said today the nation sees no
grounds for increasing output quotas by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. There is sufficient supply of oil
in the market, Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said in Moscow.  OPEC  crude output increased in July to the highest level
since December 2008, led by gains in  Saudi Arabia  and  Angola , a
Bloomberg News survey on July 29 showed. Production climbed
245,000 barrels, or 0.8 percent, to average 29.565 million
barrels a day, according to the survey of  oil companies ,
producers and analysts.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 605,916
contracts as of 3:17 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 742,508
contracts yesterday, 9 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.55 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
