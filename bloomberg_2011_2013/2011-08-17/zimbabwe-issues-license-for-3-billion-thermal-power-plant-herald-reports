Zimbabwe awarded a license to an
unidentified French company to build a 2,000 megawatt thermal
power plant in the country, the  Herald  reported, citing Energy
Minister Elton Mangoma.  The plant, estimated to cost $3 billion, will be built over
the next four years, ending a power shortage, the Harare-based
state-controlled newspaper cited Mangoma as saying on its
website. A separate proposed 2,400 megawatt thermal power plant
licensed to  RioZim Ltd. (RIOTZ)  will probably start producing
electricity in 2014, the Herald said.  The state-owned Zimbabwe Power Co., a unit of ZESA Holdings
Ltd., has identified investors to help finance a plan to boost
power from its Hwange thermal power and Kariba hydro-power
plants, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
