Lithuanian inflation, calculated
according to European Union standards, will probably remain
unchanged at 4.6 percent in August, the  statistics office  said.  Consumer prices may fall 0.2 percent from the previous
month on declining vegetable and fuel prices, the Vilnius-based
office said in a statement on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
