A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, operator of
the world’s largest product tanker fleet, said market conditions
for its tankers will remain difficult for now.  “The rates are very, very low and the markets too look
challenging in the short term,” A.P. Moeller-Maersk Chief
Executive Office Nils Smedegaard Andersen said on a conference
call today. “Maersk Tankers continue to give us some
headaches.”  The division lost $19 million in the first half, extending
losses into a third year. Tanker revenue from shipping crude
oil, oil products and gas rose 9.8 percent to $636 million from
$579 million a year earlier as seven new ships entered service,
Copenhagen-based A.P. Moeller-Maersk said in a  statement .  Maersk Tankers lost $118 million in 2010 and $255 million
in the prior year, according to annual reports. It earned $15
million in last year’s first half. The unit had profits of $328
million in 2008 and $226 million the year before that, annual
reports show.  Unrest in  Libya , higher prices for  fuel oil  that powers
ships and closings of refineries for maintenance caused
“unsatisfactory market conditions” in this year’s second
quarter, according to the statement.  A.P. Moeller-Maersk owns, operates or manages a fleet of
255 tankers and gas carriers, including 144 product tankers that
haul refined oil products such as diesel and jet fuels,
according to a  list  on its website updated in April. There are
orders for a further 23 new vessels, the list shows.  A.P. Moeller-Maersk,  Denmark ’s biggest company, reported a
13 percent gain in first-half earnings before interest and tax
to 34.6 billion kroner ($6.69 billion). That beat the 25.1
billion-krone average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 3.7 percent to 159 billion kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
