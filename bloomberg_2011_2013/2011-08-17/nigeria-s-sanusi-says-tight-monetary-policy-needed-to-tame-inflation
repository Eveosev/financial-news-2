Nigeria  needs fiscal discipline to
help keep the inflation rate below 10 percent, central bank
Governor Lamido Sanusi said.  The slowdown in inflation to 9.4 percent last month was
mainly due to food prices, Sanusi said in a text message
yesterday from Mecca,  Saudi Arabia .  The Central Bank of Nigeria, based in the capital, Abuja,
raised its benchmark  interest rate  four times this year to 8.75
percent to help curb inflation as  government spending  increased.
Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who took office today, on
Aug. 12 vowed to tighten policy to put Nigeria on a “better
fiscal path.”  “To sustain low inflation levels, we do hope that Ngozi
Okonjo-Iweala will bring fiscal discipline to bear and this
should support our tightening measures,” Sanusi said.  Parliament passed an amended budget in May that raised
President Goodluck Jonathan spending plans by 17 percent to 4.5
trillion naira ($29.billion). The government has agreed to more
than double the monthly minimum wage to 18,000 naira and plans
to end subsidies on fuel prices, adding to price pressures,
Sanusi said on July 26.  Nigeria’s central bank will make its next interest rate
decision on Sept. 20.  Price-growth eased last month because of “lower food
inflation due to the harvest,” Sanusi said. “We need to keep
an eye on  core inflation  and see how it behaves next month.”  The core inflation rate, which excludes food, rose 11.5
percent in July from a year earlier, the statistics office said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
