Agricultural losses from a  drought 
in  Texas  have reached a record $5.2 billion and may worsen
without more rain, Texas AgriLife Extension Service, a unit of
 Texas A&M University , said today in a report on its website.  The losses, which represent about 28 percent of the state’s
average annual agricultural output in the past four years,
exceed the previous record of $4.1 billion set during a drought
in 2006, AgriLife said. October to July was the driest 10-month
period on record. The estimated cost of the drought does not
include the impact on vegetable production and nursery crops.  “This drought is ongoing,” David Anderson, an AgriLife
livestock economist, said in the report. “Further losses will
continue if rainfall does not come soon to establish this year’s
winter-wheat crop and wheat grazing.”  Estimated losses in livestock production reached $2.06
billion, costs to cotton producers total $1.8 billion, and hay
losses rose to $750 million. The value of lost wheat, corn and
sorghum production was $633 million.  “Livestock losses include the increased cost of feeding
due to lack of pastures and ranges” and selling cattle at lower
weights and prices, Anderson said. “These estimates are
considered conservative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
