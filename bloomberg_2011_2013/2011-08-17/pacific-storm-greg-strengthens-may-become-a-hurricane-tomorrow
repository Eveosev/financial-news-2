Tropical Storm Greg is gathering
strength and probably will grow into a hurricane tomorrow,
without posing a threat to land, the U.S. National Hurricane
Center said.  Greg’s maximum winds increased to 50 miles (80 kilometers)
per hour, up from 40 mph earlier today, according to a center
advisory shortly before 8 a.m.  Los Angeles  time. The storm is
moving west-northwest at 21 mph about 185 miles west-southwest
of Zihuatanejo,  Mexico .  Farther out in the Pacific, Tropical Storm Fernanda
maintained its maximum winds of 50 mph and is moving west at 9
mph about 1,290 miles east-southeast of South Point,  Hawaii , the
center said.  Fernanda isn’t expected to become a hurricane, the center
said, and should weaken before  reaching Hawaii  early next week.  In the Caribbean, storms associated with a tropical wave
have a 40 percent chance of forming into a tropical cyclone, the
center said at 1:35 p.m. East Coast time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
