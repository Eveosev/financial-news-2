Sina Corp., owner of  China ’s third-
most visited website, reported second-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates as the costs of developing its microblogging
service eroded higher online advertising sales.  Net income fell to $10 million, or 15 cents a share, from
$25.2 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier, Sina said in a
statement. Profit missed the $14.5 million average of 10
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 20 percent
to $119 million.  Sina is increasing spending on China’s most-popular
microblogging service to add features such as a virtual currency
and games, as competition with a rival product from  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700)  intensifies. Chief Executive Officer Charles Chao
said in May expenses for the service, also known as Weibo, may
exceed $100 million this year.  “The spending on Weibo will be significant throughout this
year,” Connie Gu, an analyst who rates the stock “buy” at
BOCOM International in Beijing, said before the earnings. The
Weibo service can spur potential future sales from online games,
electronic commerce, and advertising, she said.  Sina fell 5.1 percent to $92.90 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading before the announcement. They rose to as high as $99.92
in after-hours trading.  Operating expenses rose 87 percent to $59.7 million, Sina
said. Sina had 140 million Weibo users, Chao said in May.  Third-quarter sales may be between $123 million and $126
million, compared with the $126 million average of nine
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sina’s website draws fewer visitors than that of Baidu Inc.,
operator of China’s most-popular search-engine, and Tencent’s
QQ.com, according to  China Websites Ranking , a site run by the
Internet Society of China that compiles Web traffic information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
