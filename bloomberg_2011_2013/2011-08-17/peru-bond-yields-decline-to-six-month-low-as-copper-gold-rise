Peru ’s benchmark bonds rose, pushing
yields down to a six-month low, as rising prices for copper and
gold, Peru’s top exports, spurred demand for the country’s
assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 5.99 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.18 centimo to
112.70 centimos per sol.  Copper and gold climbed as the dollar weakened, increasing
the investment appeal of commodities denominated in the U.S.
currency. Peru is the world’s third-largest copper and zinc
producer and sixth in gold. Metals account for two-thirds of the
South American country’s exports.  “There’s a lot of cash in the international market, and
investors are seeking out the assets of countries like Peru that
have solid balances,” said Gabriel Villalobos, the head trader
at Santiago-based brokerage Larrain Vial. “People are looking
for good quality assets that will pay them something more than
the spread over  U.S. Treasuries .”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell the most in three months,
dropping 14 basis points to 5.12 percent.  The sol strengthened 0.2 percent to 2.7370 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7427 yesterday.  The central bank didn’t purchase dollars in the spot
currency market today, the bank said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
