Crude oil futures pared their gains
after a U.S. government report showed an unexpected increase in
inventories.  Supplies rose 4.23 million barrels to 354 million in the
week ended Aug. 12, the Energy Department said today.
Inventories were forecast to decline 500,000 barrels, according
to the median of 16 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Crude oil for September delivery rose $1.70, or 2 percent,
to $88.35 a barrel at 10:35 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Oil traded at $88.95 before the release of the report
at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Futures also rose after equities climbed as earnings from
 Target Corp. (TGT)  and  Staples Inc. (SPLS)  beat estimates. Target, the
second-largest U.S. discount retailer, said profit jumped 3.7
percent in the second quarter on higher sales. Staples, the
biggest office-supply retailer, forecast earnings that topped
analysts’ projections.  The dollar dropped 0.5 percent to $1.4474 against the euro
from $1.4407 yesterday. A weaker U.S. currency bolsters the
appeal of dollar-denominated raw materials as an investment.  President Barack Obama plans to give a speech in early
September to ask Congress for more spending to boost the
economy, an administration official said. The president also
will call for long-term cuts beyond the $1.5 trillion that
Congress charged a 12-member bipartisan “super-committee” of
lawmakers to trim, the official said.  The dollar amount of the additional long-term deficit
reduction measures will exceed the cost of the new short-term
spending that he will propose, said the official. His plan will
likely have a mix of tax cuts and infrastructure spending and
will include proposals beyond the ideas that he has mentioned on
his current Midwest bus tour, such as extending a payroll tax
cut for workers and unemployment insurance benefits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
