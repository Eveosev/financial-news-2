Mexico is probing six cases of
possible  insider trading  after a  UBS AG (UBSN)  employee was fined for
using privileged information to make stock recommendations,
according to a person familiar with the investigations.  Each of the inquiries by the  National Banking and
Securities Commission , known as the CNBV, involve a separate
public company, said the person, who asked not to be named
because the investigations are in preliminary stages.  The agency is bolstering its staff dedicated to
investigating unusual share moves, especially those that occur
before an important announcement, according to the person. The
commission is also increasing pressure on companies to share
relevant information with the market, the person said.  Mexico last week fined UBS equities trader Hans Klingbeil
1.5 million pesos ($123,000) for his use of privileged company
information in stock recommendations he made to his clients. The
commission didn’t disclose the name of the company he
recommended. UBS wasn’t fined in Klingbeil’s case and the
statements on the CNBV website didn’t suggest he had personally
profited from the information.  The fine was among the first issued by the commission since
September, according to the website.  Mexican rules prevent financial service professionals from
recommending investments based on non-public information that
may influence the price of the security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
