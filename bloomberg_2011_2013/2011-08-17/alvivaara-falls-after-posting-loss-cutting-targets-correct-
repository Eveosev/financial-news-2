Talvivaara Mining Co., a Finnish
nickel producer, fell the most in almost two weeks in  London 
trading after reporting a second-quarter loss.  Talvivaara slid 26.8 pence, or 7.4 percent, to 333.5 pence
at the 4:30 close in London, the biggest decline since Aug. 4.  The net loss was 3.9 million euros ($5.6 million) compared
with a 15 million-euro loss a year earlier, the Espoo-based
company said today in a statement. The median estimate of four
analysts Bloomberg surveyed was for a 6.5 million-euro profit.  A plant stoppage in April and May and falling nickel prices
hurt results, the company said. Output in 2011 is likely to be
at the lower end of a 22,000-metric-ton to 28,000-ton target
announced in April, down from more than 30,000 tons it forecast
earlier. Guidance for next year will also be “reassessed.”  “Second-quarter results disappoint,” Liberum Capital Ltd.
said in a note to investors. “Flagged downtime at the metals
plant meant the second quarter would be underwhelming, but
production and earnings were still below Liberum and consensus
estimates.” Liberum reduced its full-year profit estimate by 45
percent to 39 million euros, according to the note.  Better Third Quarter  About 20 million euros of nickel was left unsold in the
second quarter because OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, which has an off-
take agreement with the miner, didn’t buy the metal after the
maintenance stoppage.  Third-quarter results will be better because of this
inventory, Chief Financial Officer Saila Miettinen-Lahde said by
telephone. “That was the biggest surprise of the second
quarter, which had a material effect on the second-quarter
earnings.”  The nickel cash price on the London Metal Exchange declined
to $23,113 a ton in the quarter from $28,873 a ton in the
previous quarter, the company said. Talvivaara produced 8,166
tons of nickel in the first half.  Talvivaara in June acquired 4 percent of Talvivaara Sotkamo
Oy, its operating unit, from Outokumpu Oyj for 60 million euros.  It also got an option to buy Outokumpu’s remaining 16
percent holding for 240 million euros by the end of the first
quarter of next year. Outokumpu acquired its stake in 2004 in
exchange for rights to mine the Talvivaara deposits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
