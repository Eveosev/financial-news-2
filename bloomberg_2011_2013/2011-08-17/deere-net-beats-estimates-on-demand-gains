Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest
farm-equipment maker, reported fiscal third-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates and raised its full-year earnings
forecast as global demand improved. The shares fell after
margins on new sales trailed analysts’ projections.  Net income rose to $1.69 a share in the quarter ended July
31 from $1.44 a year earlier, Moline, Illinois-based Deere said
today in a statement, topping the $1.67 a share average estimate
of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Deere predicted profit
will be $2.7 billion for the year ending Oct. 31, more than the
$2.65 billion forecast in May.  Deere, led by Chief Executive Officer Sam Allen, plans to
double annual sales to $50 billion by 2018 while increasing the
proportion of revenue from outside the U.S. and  Canada  to 50
percent from 35 percent in fiscal 2010. The company is
introducing new products and expanding manufacturing in
countries such as China, Russia and  India  to serve rising
worldwide demand for food, shelter and infrastructure.  “We remain confident that these positive macroeconomic
trends have staying power,” Allen said in the statement.  Deere fell 90 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $74.26 as of 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have dropped 11 percent this year.  Deere’s so-called incremental margin, the profit on new
sales, was about 6 percent, compared with the 11 percent
estimate from  Stephen Volkmann , a New York-based analyst at
Jefferies & Co. who has a “hold” rating on the shares.  ‘Lower Than Expected’  “The report is neutral to slightly negative for shares,”
Larry De Maria, a New York-based analyst for William Blair & Co.
who rates Deere “market perform,” said in a telephone
interview. “The incremental margins were lower than expected.”  Raw-material costs rose by $165 million in the quarter
while expenses primarily related to “global-growth
initiatives,” foreign-exchange rates and pay incentives
increased by about $75 million, Deere said on a conference call
with analysts.  “Over a longer period of time, I think you can think about
the incremental margins that this company has historically
enjoyed and have every expectation that we’ll enjoy those
incremental margins going forward,” Deere Chief Financial
Officer James Field said on the conference call.  Sales Climb  Net income increased 15 percent to $712.3 million in the
quarter from $617 million. Sales climbed 22 percent to $8.37
billion from $6.84 billion. Equipment sales will increase about
20 percent in the fourth quarter, Deere said, and about 25
percent in fiscal 2011, up from a May forecast for the full-year
of 21 percent to 23 percent.  Agriculture-industry sales in western and central  Europe 
will advance 10 percent to 15 percent in the current financial
year, Deere said.  “Deere’s array of over 100 new products in the region and
a renewed focus on its dealer network are contributing to the
company’s outperformance in key countries,”  Ann Duignan , a New
York-based analyst for JPMorgan Chase & Co. who rates the shares
“overweight,” said in a report on Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
