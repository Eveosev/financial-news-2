European stocks climbed, with the
benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rising for a fourth day out of
five, as some investors speculated that the 9.2 percent drop in
equities this month makes their valuations attractive.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S posted the best performance in the
Stoxx 600 after reporting second-quarter earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates. Health-care companies rallied as Sanofi
climbed 2.8 percent. Carlsberg A/S, the Nordic region’s largest
brewer, plunged 17 percent after reducing its full-year outlook.  The Stoxx 600 increased 0.2 percent to 238.05 at the 4:30
p.m. close in London, reversing an earlier drop of as much 1.4
percent. The Stoxx 600 has still declined 18 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 17, on concern that Europe will fail to
contain its sovereign-debt crisis and that the economic recovery
is faltering in the U.S. The retreat has left the European
benchmark trading at 9.8 times the estimated earnings of its
companies, near the lowest valuation since March 2009.  “Equity valuations are very attractive,” said Jason Pride, a strategist at Glenmede, which manages $19.8 billion for
clients, in a Bloomberg Television interview today. “We’re
favoring equities, but we’re staying defensive. There is a
larger risk than normal that you have some sort of systemic
event happen before the policy makers react” in Europe “and
that’s why the markets are hanging out where they are today.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  agreed to press for closer euro-area
cooperation, tougher deficit rules and a harmonization of their
corporate tax rates. They rejected an expansion of the 440
billion-euro ($635 billion) rescue fund. The leaders of the euro
area’s two biggest economies spoke after a two-hour meeting in
Paris.  U.K.  Interest Rates   Bank of England  policy makers  Spencer Dale  and  Martin Weale 
ended their push for an increase in interest rates this month as
the euro-area crisis and signs of a global economic cooling
threatened to hurt growth in Britain. The nine-member Monetary
Policy Committee voted unanimously to hold the key rate at a
record low 0.5 percent, according to the minutes of the Aug. 3-4
meeting published today in  London .  A report today showed that wholesale costs in the U.S. rose
in July more than forecast, led by higher prices for tobacco,
trucks and pharmaceuticals. The 0.2 percent advance in the
producer-prices index followed a 0.4 percent drop in June, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington . Economists had
forecast a 0.1 percent increase, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  National benchmark indexes rose in 12 of the 18 western
European markets this week.  Germany ’s DAX Index retreated 0.8
percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index declined 0.5 percent.
 France ’s CAC 40 Index gained 0.7 percent.  Vesta Shares Soar  Vestas surged 24 percent to 110.10 kroner, its largest
advance since 2003. The world’s biggest maker of  wind turbines 
reported a second-quarter net income of 55 million euros,
exceeding the 41.5 million-euro average estimate of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sanofi jumped 2.8 percent to 49.92, leading a gauge of
health-care companies to one of the best performances of the 19
industry groups in the Stoxx 600 today.  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  gained 3.7 percent to 103.30 francs
as  Switzerland ’s biggest life insurer posted first-half profit
of 403 million francs ($511 million). That beat the 277.3
million-franc average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Carlsberg Shares Slump  Carlsberg tumbled 17 percent to 372 kroner, its largest
drop since at least 1990, after forecasting 2011 adjusted net
income growth of 5 percent to 10 percent, compared with a
previous prediction of 20 percent. The company reported second-
quarter earnings before interest and taxes of 3.7 billion kroner
($717 million), compared with an average estimate of 4.33
billion kroner in a Bloomberg survey of 17 analysts.  The new shares of  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) , the operator of the
Frankfurt exchange, and  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  fell 5
percent to 41.10 euros and 2.8 percent to 846 pence,
respectively, after Sarkozy said France and Germany will propose
a financial-transaction tax in September. Sarkozy didn’t provide
details on the proposal during a press conference with Merkel in
Paris.  Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (HDD)  tumbled 8.9 percent to 1.51
euros, its lowest closing price since at least 1998, after the
German maker of printing presses was cut to “sell” from
“neutral” at UBS AG.  Aixtron SE sank 11 percent to 15.45 euros, its largest
retreat in more than a year, as the maker of equipment used to
produce LED screens was downgraded to “hold” from “buy” at
Deutsche Bank AG.  Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN)  slumped 5.8 percent to 10.72 Swiss
francs, its lowest price since 2001, after the second-biggest
dental implant maker was downgraded to “underweight” from
“overweight” at Morgan Stanley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
