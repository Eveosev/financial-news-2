Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is likely to invest about
$1 billion in Sharp Corp.’s Kameyama factory in  Japan  to secure
supply of displays for iPhones and iPads, MF Global FXA
Securities Ltd. said in a sales note today.  “This would have a material impact on Sharp’s
profitability,” according to the note. “We expect positive
news flow to come out over the next few months.”  Calls to Sharp offices in Tokyo and  Osaka  went unanswered
amid the Obon vacation in Japan. An Apple spokesman declined to
comment.  Sharp was unchanged at 628 yen at the 11 a.m. trading break
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
