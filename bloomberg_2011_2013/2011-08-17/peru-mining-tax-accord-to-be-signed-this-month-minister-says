Peru and mining companies may reach
an agreement on a windfall tax for the industry before the end
of this month, Energy & Mines Minister Carlos Herrera said.  “Both sides agree the proposal should be finished as
quickly as possible,” Herrera told state-run station Peru TV.
“The mining sector has understood the importance of making a
greater effort to contribute to the country’s development.”  The cabinet of President Ollanta Humala aims to announce
the accord at its presentation before Congress between Aug. 22
and Aug. 25, Herrera told the channel today. The Andean country
is the world’s third-largest copper and zinc producer.  Humala, a former army rebel, is seeking to reassure
investors that his plans to raise mining royalties and tighten
state control over natural resources won’t erode growth and
postpone $42 billion in mining investments. The new tax on
operating profits will be similar to  Chile ’s and won’t make Peru
less competitive, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said Aug. 10.  Peru’s first-half mining export revenue jumped 31 percent
to $13.2 billion as copper jumped 46 percent and gold rose 21
percent from a year earlier.  Copper futures for December delivery rose 3.8 cents, or 1
percent, to $4.053 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Gold futures for December delivery rose to a record, gaining
$8.80, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $1,793.80 an ounce at 1:41
p.m. on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
