Malaysia will give greater
flexibility to foreign banks in opening branches, relaxing
earlier rules that restricted the number of outlets they could
open in urban areas, the central bank said in a statement today.  Foreign lenders are currently allowed to open up to eight
additional branches, out of which only up to two can be set up
in city centers. In future, they will be granted more
flexibility on location, according to the statement in  Kuala
Lumpur  today.  “This would allow them to achieve a meaningful scale of
operations,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
