United Co. Rusal, the world’s
largest aluminum producer, plans to increase output of high-
purity aluminum used in computers and mobile phones as demand
rises in Asia and the U.S.  Rusal’s Krasnoyarsk plant in  Russia  is targeting a 13
percent increase in output of the high-purity metal this year to
17,000 metric tons, the Moscow-based company said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Rusal plans to restart 10 alumina-processing units that
were halted two years ago as the global recession curbed demand.
One of the 10 is already operational, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
