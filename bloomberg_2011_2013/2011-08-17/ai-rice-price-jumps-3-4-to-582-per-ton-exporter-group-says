Thai rice export prices, the
benchmark for  Asia , rose 3.4 percent after floods damaged crops
and because of a government plan to buy supplies at above-market
rates, an industry group said.  The price of 100 percent grade-B white rice increased to
$582 per metric ton this week, according to the Thai Rice
Exporters Association. The price of 25 percent broken rice rose
to $521 a ton, it said on its website today.  The association holds a meeting every week to set prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
