The U.S.  Federal Aviation
Administration  said it’s “working aggressively” to complete a
new pilot fatigue rule after missing an Aug. 1 deadline amid
opposition from cargo carriers and charter-flight operators.  The FAA last year proposed rules that would give pilots
longer rest periods between shifts and reduce the maximum hours
they can fly under fatiguing conditions.  The FAA didn’t specify a reason for the delay in an e-mail
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
