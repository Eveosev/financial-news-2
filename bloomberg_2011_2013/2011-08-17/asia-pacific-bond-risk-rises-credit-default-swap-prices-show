The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  against non-payment rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose one basis point to 145.5 basis
points as of 8:25 a.m. in Beijing, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1.5 basis points to
135.5 as of 9:32 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 4 basis points to
152 as of 10:46 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  -- Henry Sanderson . Editor: Ed Johnson  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
