Ghana ’s cedi strengthened against
the  U.S. dollar  as the central bank sold dollars and demand for
the foreign currency slowed, according to the local unit of
Standard Bank Group Ltd.  The currency of West Africa’s second-biggest economy rose
to 1.5260 per dollar by 2:34 p.m. in Accra, the capital, from an
open of 1.5275, said Chris Nettey, a currency trader with
Stanbic Bank Ghana Ltd., by phone today.  “The central bank sold some dollars today to support the
cedi,” he said, declining to say how much was offered. “There
was also not much demand for the dollar by corporate entities.”  Adams Nyinaku, head of treasury at the Bank of Ghana, was
in a meeting and unavailable to comment, according to a person
who answered the phone at his office.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
