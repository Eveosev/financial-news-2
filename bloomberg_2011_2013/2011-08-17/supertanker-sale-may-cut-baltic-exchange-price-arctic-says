The sale of a 10-year-old
supertanker for about 30 percent less than a similar vessel four
months ago may spur the Baltic Exchange in  London  to lower its
price assessment for the carriers, Oslo-based investment bank
Arctic Securities ASA said.  The 2-million barrel tanker Tenzan, built in 2000, was sold
for $36 million to a Greek buyer, according to reports from four
shipbrokers between Aug. 12 and Aug. 15. That compares with the
$51 million to $52.5 million sale four months ago of a vessel of
the same age and type.  While the Tenzan transaction was not typical of prices for
10-year-old ships, it will still prompt “more sales at
same/lower levels” than the Baltic assessment for newer ships,
Arctic analyst Erik Nikolai Stavseth wrote in an e-mailed note
today. “Broker quotes have come down rapidly” after the sale,
he said.  The price of five-year-old very large crude carriers, as
the ships are known, fell 3.1 percent last week to $77.4
million, according to the London-based  Baltic Exchange . They
have declined 7.6 percent this year.  The exchange’s weekly assessment is an average of prices
submitted by 12 member brokers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
