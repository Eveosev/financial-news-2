Ethanol production in the U.S. fell
1 percent to 899,000 barrels a day last week, according to an
Energy Department report.  Output slid from a nine-week high. Stockpiles sank 3.2
percent to 17.6 million barrels, a second consecutive weekly
drop, leaving supply at the lowest level since Jan. 7, the
report showed. Thatâ€™s enough supply for 20.2 days.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
was little changed at a record 5.31 million barrels a day.
Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of
ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 2.3 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.82 a gallon at 10:37 a.m. New York time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have gained 19 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
