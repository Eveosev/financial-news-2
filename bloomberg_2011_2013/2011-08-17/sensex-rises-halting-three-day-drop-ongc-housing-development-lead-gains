India’s benchmark stock index
advanced for the first time in four days as some investors
judged recent declines excessive.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage
lender, gained 2.5 percent.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the
largest software services exporter, led a rally among peers.  “We were punished more than we deserved,” said
Chokkalingam G, chief investment officer at Centrum Broking Pvt.
in Mumbai. “Valuations are extremely attractive. One can do
some bottom-fishing and buy stocks with a six to 12-month
horizon. The long-term India growth story is still intact.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
climbed 109.86 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,840.80 at the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai. The index’s 14-day relative strength
index, which measures how rapidly prices rose or fell, dropped
to 26.8 yesterday. Some investors see readings below 30 as a
signal to buy.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index rose 0.4 percent to 5,056.60 and
its August futures settled at 5,069.70. The BSE 200 Index
increased 0.2 percent to 2,083.80.  The Sensex has lost 18 percent this year, the worst
performer after  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index among the world’s 10
biggest markets, on concern higher borrowing costs will slow
economic growth and erode company earnings. Companies on the
Sensex are valued at 14 times estimated earnings, compared with
a multiple of 10.1 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Debt Sales  Housing Development Finance advanced 2.5 percent to 660.6
rupees. The lender is planning record debt sales in 2011 to meet
demand for loans from homebuyers. The biggest issuer of rupee-
denominated corporate bonds is aiming to raise 150 billion
rupees ($3.31 billion), 38 percent more than in 2010, according
to V. Srinivasa Rangan, an  executive director .  Tata Consultancy rose 2.7 percent to 999.9 rupees and its
nearest rival  Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO)  increased 2.1 percent to
2,448.95 rupees.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the biggest developer, slumped 6.3 percent to 177
rupees after India’s antitrust regulator fined the developer 6.3
billion rupees for “abuse of dominance” related to the sale of
apartments. The stock has lost 16 percent in the past four days.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has raised the repurchase rate 11
times since the start of 2010 and last increased it by 50 basis
points on July 26 to 8 percent to damp rising living costs.
India’s food inflation accelerated to a three-month high in the
week ended July 30, maintaining pressure on the central bank to
increase  interest rates  amid the risk of a global downturn.  Industrial Output  Investors should hold off from bets that  India ’s central
bank will cut rates as global inflation is unlikely to fall
enough to bring down the wholesale-price index, Credit Suisse
Group AG said in a report dated today.  “Against the market consensus of inflation falling and
thus potentially driving rate cuts, we believe it is too early
for the ‘monetary easing’ trade,” Credit Suisse analysts
Neelkanth Mishra and Karthik Visvanathan wrote. Prices are
“unlikely to fall much” amid quantitative easing in developed
markets unless the rupee rises against the dollar, they wrote.  India’s industrial production grew at the quickest pace in
three months in June, weathering the fastest rate increases
among  Asia ’s major economies, government data showed on Aug. 12.  “The market has sentimentally already factored in stunted
economic growth for the current fiscal year,” said N. Sethuram Iyer, chief investment officer at Daiwa Asset Management India
Pvt. “I see the market moving in the 5 percent to minus-5
percent range in the next three months.”  Overseas funds sold a net 4.05 billion rupees ($89.2
million) of Indian equities on Aug. 12, paring their investment
in stocks this year to 44.7 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
