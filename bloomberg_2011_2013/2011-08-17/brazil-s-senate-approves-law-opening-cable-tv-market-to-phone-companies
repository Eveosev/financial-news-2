Brazil ’s Senate approved a  law 
opening the cable-television market to telephone companies,
creating new opportunities for carriers such as Tele Norte Leste
Participacoes SA.  The Senate approved the bill today, Senator Jose Sarney
said in Brasilia. The bill already has been passed by the lower
house of Congress and awaits the signature of President  Dilma Rousseff , whose administration has endorsed the measure.  Cable carriers are getting into the phone and Internet
business, causing phone companies to seek to add television
service to keep customers loyal. Tele Norte Leste, Brazil’s
biggest fixed-line carrier, could offer TV service over its
phone lines.  Oi, as Tele Norte Leste is known, and rival land-line
carriers  Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA (TLPP3)  and  America Movil  SAB
already offer satellite-TV service in Brazil. Mexico City-based
America Movil’s Net Servicos unit is Brazil’s largest cable
carrier.  Oi, based in  Rio de Janeiro , fell 17 centavos to 21.63
reais today in Sao Paulo trading. Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo,
controlled by Madrid-based  Telefonica SA (TEF) , dropped 1.27 reais to
46 reais. America Movil gained 2 centavos to 14.71 pesos in
Mexico City.  To contact the reporters on this story:
