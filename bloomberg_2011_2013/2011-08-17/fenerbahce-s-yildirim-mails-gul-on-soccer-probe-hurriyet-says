Jailed Fenerbahce soccer club
chairman Aziz Yildirim wrote to Turkish President  Abdullah Gul ,
requesting that authorities release evidence against him in a
match-fixing probe,  Hurriyet  newspaper said.  A prosecutor told Yildirim a “person more famous than
him” would soon be arrested in connection with the match-fixing
allegations, without giving that person’s identity, according to
Hurriyet, citing the letter.  A fifth round of questioning in the investigation is to
begin today at an Istanbul court, Hurriyet said. Between 35 and
40 people will be brought in for questioning, including league
referees and a board member of the Turkish Football Federation;
31 people have already been arrested, according to the
