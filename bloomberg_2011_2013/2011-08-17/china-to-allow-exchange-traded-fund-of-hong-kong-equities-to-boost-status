China  will start an exchange-traded
fund linked to Hong Kong stocks as part of a range of measures
announced by Vice Premier Li Keqiang today to boost the city’s
reputation as a global financial hub.  “The ETF constituted by Hong Kong-listed stocks will be
launched,” Li said in Hong Kong today. “Its status as a
financial center in  Asia  and globally is crucial for Hong Kong’s
development.”  The government scrapped a plan in January 2010 to allow
Chinese nationals to buy Hong Kong stocks directly and instead
expanded a program under which Chinese institutions can invest
in overseas markets. The so-called “through-train” program was
unveiled by regulators in August 2007, and helped push the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  to a record high that October.  Bank of Communications Co., BOC Hong Kong (Holdings) Ltd.
and Bank of East Asia Ltd. jumped more than 2.4 percent in Hong
Kong trading following Li’s comments at an economic forum. He
also pledged an initial 20 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) quota for
Hong Kong companies to invest in securities in China.  “The impact on the Hong Kong market will be more long term
than short term, because to implement these measures, it takes
few months to a year of application,” said Danny Yan, a Hong
Kong-based portfolio manager at Haitong International Asset
Management, which oversees $600 million. These moves “will
benefit Hong Kong in terms of depth and liquidity,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
