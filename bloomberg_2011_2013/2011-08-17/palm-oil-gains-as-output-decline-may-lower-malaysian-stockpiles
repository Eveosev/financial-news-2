Palm oil climbed on speculation that
a drop in output this month in  Malaysia  and  Indonesia , the
world’s two biggest producing countries, may lower stockpiles
amid a surge in exports.  November-delivery palm oil advanced 1 percent to 3,033
ringgit ($1,020) per metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. Futures have climbed 15 percent in the past year.  “Production is likely to come off in the near term,
because of the festive” season, said Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd. The outlook “looks quite good because
export data looks strong,” Ng said.  Output in Malaysia and Indonesia usually declines during
the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which began on Aug. 1 this
year, as overseas workers head home for the Eid festivities or
work shorter shifts.  “The festive season and Ramadan season is making
agricultural labor unavailable for the harvesting,” Vimala
Reddy, an analyst at Karvy Comtrade Ltd., said by phone from the
Indian city of Hyderabad. “When there isn’t manpower for
harvesting, that will obviously affect the production,”  Output from Malaysia this month may be 300,000 tons to
500,000 tons less than in July, before rebounding from September
onward, Reddy said.  Production slipped 0.1 percent to 1.75 million tons in
July, the Malaysian  Palm Oil  Board said on Aug. 10. Stockpiles
dropped to 2 million tons in July from 2.05 million tons in
June, while exports rose 9.1 percent to a record 1.73 million
tons, it said.  Overseas Shipments  Malaysia’s exports rose 26 percent to 953,852 tons in the
first 15 days of August from 752,047 tons in the same period in
July, surveyor Intertek said Aug. 15. Shipments rose 29.5
percent to 947,594 tons, Societe Generale de Surveillance said.  “Going into the fourth quarter of the year, production
from Indonesia is expected to be quite strong after the current
lull,” Ng said.  Indonesian output may gain 3 million tons to 25.5 million
tons this year, while Malaysia may produce 19 million tons, 2
million tons more than last year,  Dorab Mistry , director of
Godrej International Ltd., said on July 28.  Palm oil was also being supported by soybeans, which are
crushed to make a rival oil, and gains in crude oil, said Reddy.  The U.S. soybean crop will be 8.2 percent smaller than a
year ago after farmers planted less, while heat in July helped
reduce yield potential, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
Aug. 11 in its first survey-based forecast for this year.  Soybeans for delivery in November were unchanged at $13.495
per bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 6:04 p.m. in
 Singapore , while December-delivery  soybean oil  was little
changed at 55.61 cents a pound.  Oil gained as much as 1.3 percent in  New York , as investors
bet that shrinking fuel stockpiles in the U.S. indicate demand
will increase in the world’s biggest crude-consuming nation.  Palm oil for May delivery increased 0.6 percent to close at
8,864 yuan ($1,388) per ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while soybean oil for delivery in the same month rose 0.7
percent to settle at 10,062 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
