CIFG Assurance North America Inc.
sued  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  for fraud over $275 million in
residential mortgage-backed securities.  Goldman Sachs made misrepresentations in connection with
the securitization of a portfolio of 6,204 mortgage loans,
according to the lawsuit filed yesterday in New York State
Supreme Court in Manhattan. CIFG insured about $275 million of
securities from the portfolio.  The investment bank duped investors and insurers into
assuming its market risk, even as Goldman Sachs profited from
underwriting fees, trading opportunities and bets on a decline
in the subprime market, New York-based CIFG said.  While Goldman Sachs aggressively sought to liquidate its
position in residential mortgage-backed securities, “it also
sought to exploit the crisis,” according to the complaint.  Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The case is CIFG Assurance North America Inc. v. Goldman,
Sachs & Co., 652286/2011,  New York  Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
