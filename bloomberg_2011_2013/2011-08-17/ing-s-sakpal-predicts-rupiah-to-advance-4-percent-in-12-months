Prakash Sakpal, a Singapore-based
economist at ING Groep NV, comments on the outlook for the
Indonesian rupiah in a research note published today.  ING predicts the currency will strengthen 4 percent to
8,200 per dollar in 12 months. The currency traded at 8,528 in
Jakarta today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Against a backdrop of strong economic growth and subdued
inflation the official rupiah forecast appears too bearish.  ‘‘The continued fiscal consolidation keeps  Indonesia  on a
sovereign-rating upgrade cycle. We expect S&P and Fitch, both
having positive outlook on the BB+ rating, to upgrade to the
investment grade within the next 12 months.  ‘‘President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono proposed the 2012
budget to parliament yesterday with projected reduction in
fiscal deficit to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product from
this year’s 2.1 percent.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
