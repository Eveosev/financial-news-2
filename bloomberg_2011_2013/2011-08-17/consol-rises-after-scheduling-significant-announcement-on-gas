Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , an Appalachian
coal and natural-gas producer, rose 8.9 percent in after-hours
trading in New York after saying it will make a “significant”
announcement about gas tomorrow.  The announcement will be made at 7 a.m. New York time and
will be followed by an investor conference call, Pittsburgh-
based Consol said today in a statement.  Consol rose $3.78 to $46.20 at 6:02 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange. The statement was issued after the close of
regular trading.  Consol, which gets most of its revenue from coal mining,
drills in the Marcellus and Utica shale deposits where gas is
locked in non-porous rock that made the reserves inaccessible
until new extraction technologies were developed in the 1990s.  The company bought Dominion Resources Inc.’s gas
exploration and production business last year for $3.48 billion
and spent an additional $963 million to buy the 17 percent of
CNX Gas Corp. that it didn’t already own.  To contact the reporter on this story:
