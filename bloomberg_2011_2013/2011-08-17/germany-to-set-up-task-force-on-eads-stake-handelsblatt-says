Daimler AG (DAI)  and representatives from
the German Chancellery, the  Economy Ministry  and the  Finance
Ministry  will set up a  task force  to advance the sale of a 7.5
percent stake in European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. held
by Daimler,  Handelsblatt  said.  The goal is to sell the stake to private German investors
by the end of the year, the newspaper said, citing German
government officials it didn’t name. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
coalition has no “solution” should the planned sale to private
investors fail, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
