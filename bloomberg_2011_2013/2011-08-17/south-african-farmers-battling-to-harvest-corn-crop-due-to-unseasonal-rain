South African farmers are struggling
to harvest their corn crops in some parts of the country because
of rain, Grain SA said.  “Due to the unusually wet conditions experienced so far,
the harvesting process in certain problem areas is progressing
slower than usual,” the organization said in an e-mailed
statement today. A survey found that 16.3 percent of the total
area in problem areas of the North West Free State and the
Northwest Province have not been harvested, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
