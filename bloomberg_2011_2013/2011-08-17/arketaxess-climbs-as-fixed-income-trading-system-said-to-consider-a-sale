MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX) , the
operator of an electronic trading system for fixed-income
securities, is exploring a sale of the company, said a person
familiar with the decision. Shares surged as much as 26 percent.  The company has a market value of $1 billion as of the
closing price today. The person with knowledge of the matter
spoke on condition of anonymity because the company’s
deliberations, reported yesterday by the Wall Street Journal,
are private.  MarketAxess rose $3.40, or 14 percent, to $27.45 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading. Earlier, shares reached $30.25, the
biggest intra-day price gain since October 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Florencia Panizza, a MarketAxess spokeswoman in New York,
didn’t return a call seeking comment.  The New York-based company competes with Bloomberg LP, the
parent of Bloomberg News, in offering trading of bonds and
credit-default swaps and the sale of financial data.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the largest shareholder in
MarketAxess with a stake of about 15 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
