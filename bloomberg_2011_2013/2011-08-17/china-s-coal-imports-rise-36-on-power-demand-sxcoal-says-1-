China ’s July coal imports climbed 36
percent to 17.53 million metric tons from a year earlier,
sxcoal.com, a Shanxi-based industry portal, said on its  website ,
citing Chinese customs data.  That exceeded the customs bureau’s record of 17.34 million
tons in December and 13.73 million tons in June. The official
customs data is due to be released Aug. 22.  The world’s largest coal consumer and producer increased
imports of the fuel amid the worst summer power shortages in at
least seven years. A shrinking gap between domestic prices and
global costs are also spurring purchases. The premium of Chinese
coal to Newcastle prices narrowed to $8.74 a ton on June 10,
according to Mirae Assets Ltd.  Coking-coal imports gained 29 percent to 4.05 million tons
last month and coal for  power plants  rose 15 percent to 4.99
million tons, according to sxcoal. Imports declined 5.3 percent
to 87.87 million tons in the first seven months, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
