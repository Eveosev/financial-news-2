Gold futures rose to a record
settlement price for the second straight day after U.S.
wholesale costs rose more than forecast in July, spurring demand
for the precious metal as a hedge against inflation.  An index of producer prices gained 0.2 percent last month,
the Labor Department said today. Economists forecast a 0.1
percent increase. The so-called core measure, which excludes
food and energy, climbed 0.4 percent, the most since January.
The dollar fell as much as 0.8 percent against a six-currency
basket. Gold has gained 26 percent this year, reaching an
intraday all-time high of $1,817.60 an ounce on Aug. 11.  “The inflationary story is back,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a
senior strategist at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “The weaker dollar is also helping
gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $8.80, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $1,793.80 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The metal has outperformed global equities,
commodities and Treasuries in 2011 as Europe’s debt crisis and
the threat of slowing global growth boosted demand for an
investment haven.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  rejected an expansion of the euro region’s
rescue fund and rebuffed calls for joint euro borrowing, while
Switzerland’s central bank said it will take further measures if
needed to combat the Swiss currency’s strength.  ‘Most Appealing’  “Gold is still the most-appealing asset in the short run,
while uncertainty over the euro zone’s future will not evaporate
overnight,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in
London, said in a report.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 53 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $40.378 an ounce in New York. The price has climbed
31 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
September delivery climbed $19.40, or 2.6 percent, to $775.90 an
ounce, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since July
26.  Platinum futures for October delivery advanced $22.70, or
1.2 percent, to $1,840.80 an ounce. That marked the eighth
straight gain, the longest rally since October 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
