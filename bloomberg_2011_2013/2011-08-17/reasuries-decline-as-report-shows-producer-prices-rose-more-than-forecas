Treasuries dropped after a
government report showed wholesale costs in the U.S. increased
in July more than economists forecast.  “The data was higher than expected, so it’s showing a
little bit more inflation pressure than in recent months,” said
Thomas Simons, a government debt economist in New York at
Jefferies Group Inc., one of 20 primary dealers that trade with
the  Federal Reserve . “It’s still generally tame. It shouldn’t
change people’s expectations of future inflation or the Fed’s
response.”  Benchmark 10-year yields gained two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.24 percent at 8:44 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.125 percent
securities maturing in August 2021 dropped 6/32, or $1.88 per
$1,000 face amount, to 98 30/32. The record low yield is 2.0346
percent, set on Aug. 9.  The producer-price index advanced 0.2 percent last month
following a 0.4 percent drop in June, the Labor Department
reported. The median forecast of 78 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 0.1 percent gain.  The spread between yields on 10-year Treasuries and
comparable inflation-indexed debt, a gauge of trader
expectations for consumer prices over the life of the maturities
known as the break-even rate, shrank earlier today to 2.15
percentage points, the least since Aug. 9, when it reached this
year’s low of 2.14 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
