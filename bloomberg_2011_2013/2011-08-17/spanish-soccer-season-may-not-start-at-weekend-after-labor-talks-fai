The opening weekend of games in
Spanish soccer’s top two divisions is in jeopardy after talks
today between players and the league failed to produce a
collective bargaining agreement.  The players’ association, known as AFE, and the
professional league, known as  LFP , couldn’t reach a labor accord
that includes more protection for the players’ salaries, the LFP
said in a  press release  on its website.  Players said Aug. 11 they’d strike the first two weeks of
the season, which is due to start in three days. The strike is
“absolutely unjustified but it’s also sterile because the LFP
has reached the limit of its possibilities,” the league said.  “We haven’t reached an agreement,” LFP Chairman Jose Luis Astiazaran was quoted as saying by  El Mundo  newspaper after the
meeting. “Our differences are significant, but we’ll have to
continue.”  The sides will meet again in two days in Madrid to try to
“find solutions,” the league said. A league spokesman, who
could not be identified because of its policy, said there’s
almost no chance of this weekend’s games being played and that
it’s too early to know when an agreement may be reached.  Juanjo Montaner, a spokesman for AFE, declined to comment
when contacted by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
