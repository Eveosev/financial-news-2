Bright Food Group Co.,  China ’s
second-largest food company, has inked a deal to buy a 75
percent stake in Australia’s Manassen Foods as it aims to boost
overseas sales.  The two companies hope to “achieve synergies through
expanding Manassen Foods’ domestic and export business,” they
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday, without stating how
much Bright Food agreed to pay. On Aug. 15 two people familiar
with the matter said Bright Food will pay about A$400 million
($420 million) to buy the stake from CHAMP Private Equity.  The deal comes after a series of failed acquisition
attempts by Bright Food which lost out to General Mills Inc. for
a stake in French yogurt maker Yoplait earlier this year. The
company was outbid by Wilmar International Ltd. for CSR Ltd.’s
sugar unit in 2010.  Bright Food Chairman Wang Zongnan aims to have as much as
30 percent of total sales from overseas market in five years and
has been looking for foreign assets in sugar, dairy, wine, food
distribution and manufacturing industries.  Funds advised by CHAMP, Roy Manassen, and members of
Manassen’s senior management team will own the rest of Manassen
Foods, which makes Albatros bread and Harringtons chocolates.  The deal is pending regulatory approvals and Bright Food
executives will visit  Australia  in late August for an official
signing ceremony, according to the statement. Bright Food is
conducting the deal through its subsidiary Shanghai Sugar
Cigarette and Wine (Group) Co., it said.  Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit and UBS AG
advised Manassen. Nomura Holdings Inc. advised Bright Food,
according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
