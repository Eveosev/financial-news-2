United Manganese of Kalahari, 49
percent owned by billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg ’s Renova Group,
is interested in a merger of its assets with Viktor Pinchuk’s
EastOne LLC, a board member said.  UMK, as the company is known, “is very enthusiastic”
about creating an international company that will include
EastOne’s manganese assets, UMK director Vladimir Kremer said in
e-mailed comments today. The combined entity would have the
reserves and production to be an “industry champion,” and may
inlude Renova’s Transalloys refinery, he said.  EastOne spokeswoman Natalia Vovk couldn’t immediately be
reached on her mobile phone for comment.  UMK holds the world’s largest reserves of manganese at 282
million metric tons. Renova agreed in 2007 to buy the
Transalloys refinery in  South Africa  from  Evraz Group SA (EVR)  unit
Highveld Steel & Vanadium Ltd.  EastOne controls three ferroalloy plants and two ore-
processing facilities in Ukraine, including  Nikopolsky Zavod
Ferosplavov (NFER) , one of the world’s biggest manganese ferroalloys
producers.  Renova and Evraz shareholder Alexander Abramov and their
partners planned to buy Nikopolsky in 2005. The transaction was
canceled by a court order, Interfax reported at the time, after
the country’s so-called Orange Revolution led to scrutiny of
deals allegedly conducted at a discount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
