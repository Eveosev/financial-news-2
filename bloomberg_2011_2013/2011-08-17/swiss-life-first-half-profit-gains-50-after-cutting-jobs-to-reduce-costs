Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN) , Switzerland’s
biggest life insurer, said first-half profit climbed 50%,
exceeding analyst estimates, after cutting jobs as part of a
cost-reduction program.  Net income rose to 403 million francs ($506 million), from
268 million francs a year earlier, the Zurich-based insurer said
in a statement today. That beat the 277.3 million-franc average
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Swiss Life has completed 324 million francs of savings as
part of its Milestone program to reduce costs by as much as 400
million francs and cut 520 jobs in Switzerland. Premiums at the
insurer’s Swiss unit increased 11 percent while investment
returns boosted profit in France.  “The Milestone program is successful,” said Stefan Schuermann, a Zurich-based analyst with Vontobel Holding AG.
Earnings were also “driven by a solid segment result from
 Switzerland  and an upbeat contribution from France,” he said.  Swiss Life rose as much as 4.2 percent and was 2.3 percent
up at 101.9 francs as of 9:53 a.m. in Zurich trading. That pared
this year’s decline to 22 percent compared with the 13 percent
drop in the 28-company Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index.  The insurer reported one-time tax revenue of 89 million
francs due to the “disposal of business activities” in prior
years. Chief Executive Officer Bruno Pfister declined to comment
further on the tax benefit on a conference call today.  Cost Cutting  Swiss Life will continue to cut costs in the second half of
2011 and in 2012, according to Chief Financial Officer Thomas Buess.  “The increase in our profit from operations in the first
half of the year is mainly attributable to the operational
advances we made through Milestone,” Buess said in the
statement. “We will continue to resolutely follow this path.”  The insurer’s biggest unit in Switzerland boosted gross
written premiums to 5.86 billion francs. While premium income
fell 17 percent in  France , operating profit rose 57 percent to
74 million francs because of an improved investment result,
Swiss Life said.  Total gross written premiums fell 18 percent to 10.1
billion francs from a year earlier after declines in  Germany  and
at Swiss Life’s unit selling so-called insurance wrappers to
wealthy private banking clients.  Investment Return  The company, which targets a full-year investment return of
3.4 percent to 3.6 percent, posted a return of 1.9 percent in
the first half compared with 1.8 percent in 2010. Buess said in
May he expects the company to achieve the target.  The insurer wrote down its holdings of Greek  government
bonds  by 43 million francs, Buess said in a presentation today,
adding that Swiss Life has increased investments in AAA-rated
corporate bonds.  Swiss Life aims to generate a return on equity of 10
percent to 12 percent by 2012 from selling more pension
products. The life insurer is targeting a new business margin of
2.2 percent by the same date. The margin was 1.6 percent in the
first half.  AWD Holding AG, the German financial services broker that
Swiss Life acquired in 2008, reported a first-half operating
profit of 21.8 million euros ($31.4 million), compared with 20.4
million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
