Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
said he will move forward with a proposal to repatriate as much
as $11 billion of gold reserves held in the U.S. and Europe as
part of a plan to shift assets away from American institutions.  Venezuela will transfer 99 tons of gold from the Bank of
England to the South American country’s central bank, Chavez
said today on state television. Venezuela also has gold at
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc, Standard Chartered Plc and
the Bank of Nova Scotia, he said.  “It’s a healthy decision to bring the gold back to
Venezuela,” Chavez said.  Chavez, who has said he wants to eliminate the
“dictatorship” of the  U.S. dollar , has called on Venezuela’s
central bank to diversify its $28.7 billion in reserves away
from U.S. institutions. Cash reserves will be shifted into
currencies from emerging markets including  China , Russia, Brazil
and India, Central bank President Nelson Merentes said today at
a press conference.  To contact the reporters on this story:
