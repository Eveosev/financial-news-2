Xiu.com , the Chinese e-commerce site
that sells Dolce & Gabbana watches and other luxury goods, said
it received $100 million from two private equity firms to boost
distribution and add more warehouses as business expands.  U.S. private equity firm  Warburg Pincus  LLC led the
investment, with additional funding from the  China  unit of
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which also invested $20
million in March, Xiu.com said an e-mailed statement. It didn’t
provide further details.  The Shenzhen-based online marketplace may quadruple sales
to more than 1 billion yuan ($156.6 million) this year,
according to the statement, which cited Xiu.com Chief Executive
Officer Ji Wenhong. The transaction value of online luxury goods
sales in China may reach 16 billion yuan this year, according to
a report by Beijing-based research firm Analysys International.  China is set to become the world’s third-largest luxury
market in five years, Bain & Co. said May 3. Mainland China will
remain the fastest-growing market for  luxury goods  in 2011 as
sales rise 25 percent to 11.5 billion euros ($16.6 billion), the
Boston-based business-consulting company said.  Xiu.com, which began in 2008 and claims to be China’s No. 1
e-commerce site for luxury goods, offers products from more than
3,000 brands, according to its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
