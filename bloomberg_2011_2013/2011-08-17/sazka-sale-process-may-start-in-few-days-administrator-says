The sale of Sazka AS, a bankrupt
lottery company, may start in a “few days” after the Prague
Municipal Court approved conditions for a tender proposed by a
creditors’ committee, a bankruptcy administrator said.  The court approved today a proposal by the creditors’
committee to sell Sazka by tender where all prospective bidders
will be asked to provide a deposit of 500 million koruna ($29.6
million), Lenka Ticha, a spokeswoman for bankruptcy
administrator Josef Cupka, said by phone.  The administrator may start the sale within a few days,
Ticha said. The bidders will have to provide the deposit within
three weeks after the sale is announced and will have another
two weeks to file their bids.  The Prague court put the company into bankruptcy in May.
Sazka was declared insolvent after it breached covenants on
bonds issued to finance the construction of the 02 Arena, which
hosted the World Hockey Championship in 2004.  Cupka said earlier that the price offered will be the main
criteria for choosing the new owner.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
