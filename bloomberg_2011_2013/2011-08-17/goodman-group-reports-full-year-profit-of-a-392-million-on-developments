Goodman Group (GMG) , Australia’s biggest
industrial real estate investment trust, will seek to raise A$1
billion ($1.05 billion) in equity over the next year as it
expands in  Japan ,  China  and  Europe .  The group is planning about A$900 million of development in
Japan over the next year, the first of which will be revealed
next week, Chief Executive Officer Greg Goodman said in a
telephone interview. It has about 2 million square meters (23
million square feet) of land either in hand or under negotiation
across China and is conducting due diligence to buy properties
to expand its European Logistics Fund over the next six months,
he said.  “In a world where growth is going to be slow, we’re well
positioned,” Goodman said. “Interest rates around the world
are pretty low and good assets at good yields are attractive.”  The Sydney-based company swung to a profit of A$392 million
in the year to June 30, driven by its management and development
businesses, it said today. Operating profit will be about A$460
million in the 2012 fiscal year, it said.  In addition to the equity it will raise, the group will
also consider bond sales in  Australia , loans from non-bank
lenders, private placements in the U.S. and European debt, if
terms are attractive, Goodman said.  Goodman shares dropped 3 percent to 64.50 Australian cents
at the 4:10 p.m. close of trade in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
