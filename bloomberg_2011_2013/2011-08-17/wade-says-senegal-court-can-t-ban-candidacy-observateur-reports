Lawyers working for Senegal’s
president, Abdoulaye Wade, said the country’s Constitutional
Court lacks the authority to decide whether he can run for
office again, l’Observateur reported, citing a legal team memo.  Wade will face the West African nation’s highest court in
September to argue that the third term he is seeking in a
February election would be just his second under the country’s
current constitution, which limits the president to two terms in
office, the Dakar-based newspaper said, citing the memo.  The court only has the mandate to ensure that Wade is a
Senegalese citizen, literate, and at least 35 years old,
according to the memo. The newspaper did not say how it obtained
the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
