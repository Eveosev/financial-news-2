Lorillard Inc. (LO) , the maker of Newport
cigarettes, said it joined with three other  tobacco companies  in
a legal bid to stop the agency from putting new warnings on
cigarette packs.  Lorillard, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Commonwealth Brands
Inc. and Liggett Group LLC filed a lawsuit yesterday in U.S.
District Court in  Washington , Greensboro, North Carolina-based
Lorillard said in a statement. The filing couldn’t be
immediately confirmed with the court.  Lorillard seeks a preliminary injunction to halt the
effective date of the FDA regulation, which requires cigarette
packs, cartons and advertising to display new graphic warning
labels by Sept. 22, 2012, the company said. The warnings will be
accompanied by pictures of rotting teeth or damaged lungs to
deter smokers.  “The regulations violate the First Amendment,” Floyd Abrams, a lawyer representing Lorillard, said in the statement.
“The notion that the government can require those who
manufacture a lawful product to emblazon half of its package
with pictures and words admittedly drafted to persuade the
public not to purchase that product cannot withstand
constitutional scrutiny.”  A phone message left yesterday with the FDA’s office of
public affairs seeking comment on the lawsuit wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
