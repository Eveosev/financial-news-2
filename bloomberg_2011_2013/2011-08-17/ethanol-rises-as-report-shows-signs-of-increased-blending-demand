Ethanol futures rose a seventh day
in  Chicago , extending the longest winning streak in three
months, after a government report showed increased demand for
the biofuel.  Futures rose after an Energy Department report showed
gasoline stockpiles shrank 3.51 million barrels last week to
210.1 million, the largest drop since April 8. Ethanol supply
sank 3.2 percent to 17.6 million barrels, the lowest level since
Jan. 7, it said.  “The drop in gasoline stocks lent some support to
ethanol,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. in Chicago. “Ethanol stocks were off, too. It
seems to be getting good support.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery climbed 0.8 cent,
or 0.3 percent, to $2.805 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures are up 18 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago gained 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.825 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel
rose 0.5 cent to $2.91, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased 0.5 cent to $2.93 a
gallon.  Production of the biofuel in the U.S. fell 1 percent to
899,000 barrels a day last week, the Energy Department report
showed.  Output of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol was
little changed at a record 5.3 million barrels a day. Refiners
receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended
into the motor fuel.  The profit from turning a bushel of corn into 2.75 gallons
of ethanol, or the so-called crush margin, was 22 cents today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corn is the primary basis for the fuel in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
