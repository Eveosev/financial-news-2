Colombia ’s peso rose for a seventh
day, its longest winning streak in more than a year, on bets
rising interest rates in the South American country will attract
more investment from abroad.  The peso climbed 0.5 percent to 1,766.24 per dollar at 3:25
p.m. New York time, from 1,775.46 yesterday. It advanced for
nine straight days in June 2010. The peso has gained 8 percent
this year, the best performance among the six most-traded Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Banco de la Republica will raise its overnight lending rate
to 5 percent by year-end, according to a central bank survey
published last week, widening the interest-rate differential
with the U.S. The  Federal Reserve  has pledged to keep its
benchmark interest rate at a record low at least through the
middle of 2013 in a bid to spur the flagging economic recovery.  “After the Fed’s announcement, there’s an even greater
incentive for flows to move into emerging markets,” said Daniel Velandia, head analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Correval SA.
“The carry trade will have an important role in the peso’s
behavior, and now people are betting the peso can reach 1,750
without much effort.”  The carry trade refers to the practice in which investors
borrow funds in a country with lower borrowing costs and buy
assets where interest rates are higher.  Colombia’s peso bonds have been rising amid bets the
widening  interest-rate  differential with the U.S. will lead to
boosted demand for the securities, according to Velandia.  Bond Yield  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
has fallen 16 basis points this month. The yield rose four basis
points today to 7.49 percent. The bond’s price fell 0.355
centavo to 120.368 centavos.  Colombia’s borrowing costs fell today at an auction of peso
bonds in inflation-linked currency units known as UVR.  The securities due February 2023 were sold to yield to 3.78
percent, lower than the 3.9 percent at the last auction on July
21, the  Finance Ministry  said in a statement. Colombia also
auctioned bonds due May 2017 to yield 3.35 percent, and due
February 2015 to yield 3.11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
