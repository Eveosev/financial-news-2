US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) , the smallest
of the major U.S. full-fare carriers, is in early talks with
Airbus SAS about whether the A321neo jet could be a replacement
for the airline’s aging  Boeing Co. (BA)  757s.  “While we can confirm we are talking to Airbus, our talks
are in a very informal stage as we gather more information from
them on the potential capabilities of the A321neo,” Todd Lehmacher, a US Airways spokesman, said today in an e-mail.  Though the Tempe, Arizona-based airline currently has no
plans to order additional narrow-body aircraft, it eventually
will have to decide on a 757 replacement, he said. US Airways’
24 757s have an average age of about 18 years. Boeing built the
last 757 in 2004.  US Airways uses the single-aisle 757s on some international
routes from its U.S. East Coast hubs, including  Charlotte ,  North
Carolina , to Dublin. There are 89 Boeing aircraft in US Airways’
339-plane fleet, or about 26 percent of the total.  “We talk to aircraft manufacturers all the time,”
Lehmacher said, without saying specifically whether US Airways
was looking at a 757 replacement from Boeing.  Clay McConnell, a U.S. spokesman for Toulouse, France-based
Airbus, declined to comment on talks with US Airways.  “US Airways is a great customer,” he said. “We have a
longstanding relationship with them. We talk with airlines that
are our customers and aren’t our customers all the time.”  Marc Birtel , a spokesman for Chicago-based Boeing, declined
to comment. The company’s 737-900 is closest in range and size
to the 757.  Neo Versions  The neo has become Airbus’s fastest-selling aircraft since
the planemaker announced in December that it would offer a
version of its narrow-body planes with new, more fuel-efficient
engines. Airbus is offering neo versions of its A320, the larger
A321 and the smaller A319.  The A321 had a shorter range than the 757 until Airbus
decided to offer it with so-called sharklets, a type of upturned
wingtip that adds 100 nautical miles (185 kilometers) to its
reach or increases the payload by 1,100 pounds (500 kilograms).
The sharklets will be available starting next year.  The talks between  US Airways  and Airbus were reported
earlier today by TheStreet.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
