Gruma SAB, the world’s largest
producer of corn and wheat tortillas, said a special committee
headed by chairman Roberto Gonzalez Barrera will lead the
company after Raul Pelaez Cano resigned as the chief executive
officer.  The committee, made up of company executives, will oversee
daily operations until Oct. 26, when the board of directors
plans to meet. Meanwhile, the board is searching for a new chief
executive officer, Gruma said in a statement to the Mexican
stock exchange yesterday after the market closed.  Pelaez, who resigned for personal reasons, was named chief
executive officer Dec. 6, replacing Gonzalez Barrera. He holds a
business degree from the Autonomous Technological Institute of
 Mexico  and served as Gruma’s chief financial officer and
strategic planning officer since 2004, according to a company
statement.  Pelaez Cano has also worked at Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex
unit and General Electric Co.’s Mexico operations.  Gruma announced on Nov. 22 the resignation of U.S. chief
executive Juan Fernando Roche.  To contact the reporter on this story:
