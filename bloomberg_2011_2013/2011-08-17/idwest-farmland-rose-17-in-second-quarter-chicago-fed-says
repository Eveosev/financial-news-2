Farmland values in one of the most
productive regions in the U.S. Midwest rose 17 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier as higher grain prices made
real estate more attractive, the Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago
said in an e-mailed report.  Rising demand for wheat, corn and soybeans boosted
earnings, supporting higher land prices in the five-state
Seventh Federal Reserve District, according to the  report . The
increase in farmland values was the biggest since the 1970s, the
Fed said. Gains were reported in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana,
Michigan and Wisconsin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
