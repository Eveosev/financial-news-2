New York  Jets offensive lineman
Robert Turner will need surgery after breaking his right leg,
the  Associated Press  said, citing an unidentified National
Football League official.  Turner, 26, was hurt when Houston Texans rookie J.J. Watt
rolled into his leg from behind in the first quarter of New
York’s 20-16 loss at Houston in the preseason opener Aug. 15.
Turner was playing in place of injured center Nick Mangold.  The length of Turner’s recovery won’t be known until after
the surgery, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
