The Italian government’s 45.5
billion-euro ($65 billion) austerity package was formally
presented in the Senate today, paving the way for the review
process to start, the Senate said on its website.  The Constitutional Affairs and Budget Committee will start
examining the bill next week and the full Senate will likely
vote on the plan in the first week of September.  Italy’s deficit-reduction plan, approved by Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi ’s Cabinet on Aug. 12, aims to balance the
budget in 2013 by raising the capital-gains tax, increasing
levies on the highest earners, cutting  government spending  and
reducing funding to regional administrations.  The measures, passed by decree, have taken effect
immediately and must be approved by parliament within 60 days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
