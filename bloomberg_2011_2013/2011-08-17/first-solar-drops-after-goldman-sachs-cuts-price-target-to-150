First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s
biggest maker of thin-film solar modules, sank as much as 7.8
percent after a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst reduced the
price target to $150 from $175.  First Solar dropped $6.12, or 5.9 percent, to $98.34 at
10:21 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares, which
earlier slipped to $96.32, have declined 24 percent this year.  Mark Wienkes at Goldman Sachs in New York has a
“buy/neutral” rating on Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar,
according to Bloomberg data.  Jens Meyerhoff, First Solar’s president of utility systems
and former chief financial officer, plans to leave on Sept. 30
and will be replaced by  James Brown , the company said in a
statement yesterday after the close of regular U.S. trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
