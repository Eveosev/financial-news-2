Saudi Arabia ’s domestic crude use
fell 4.3 percent in June from a month earlier, according to
government data.  The world’s largest crude exporter consumed an average 1.89
million barrels a day of oil, compared with 1.98 million in May,
Saudi figures posted on the Joint Organization Data Initiative
website today showed. The PetroRabigh refinery was shut for
maintenance in the period.  Crude use increased from 1.83 million barrels a day a year
earlier, the data show. Saudi Arabia, which aims to fulfill Oil
Minister Ali al-Naimi’s recent pledge to increase production to
make up for lost Libyan output after an armed rebellion, is
facing rising domestic demand as the nation’s population grew
3.2 percent annually from 2004 to 2010.  Consumption reached a record in February when the country
used 2 million barrels a day before two of its refineries, the
PetroRabigh and Yanbu plants, were shut for maintenance. This is
the highest level since at least January 2002, the year when
Saudi Arabia started submitting oil data to JODI. The initiative
is supervised by the Riyadh-based  International Energy Forum  and
shows data supplied directly by governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
