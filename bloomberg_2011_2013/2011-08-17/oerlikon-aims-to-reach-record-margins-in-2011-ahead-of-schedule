OC Oerlikon Corp. AG, a Swiss
textile machinery maker, aims to report record profit margins
this year, earlier than previously predicted, after cutting
costs and booking more orders in emerging markets.  Oerlikon forecast earnings before interest and tax of as
much as 9 percent of sales this year, it said today in an e-
mailed statement. That would beat a previous record of 8 percent
in 2007. Before today the Pfaeffikon-based company had said it
expected 2011 margins “nearing” a record and that it would
beat previous margins “in coming years.”  The company’s return to profit this year after three years
of losses follows a revamp which includes cutting 1,700 jobs by
the end of this year after eliminating 2,000 in 2009. Chief
Executive Officer Michael Buscher is expanding in faster growing
economies including  China ,  Brazil  and  Russia .  “China offers opportunities in coatings, vacuum, solar and
drives,” Buscher said today in a telephone interview. “We
would like to expand our solar supplier base there. There is
also potential for growth in Brazil and Russia.”  Demand in July was “good,” and the company hasn’t seen
the recent volatility in markets affect customer orders, Buscher
said. Oerlikon expects full-year sales to rise as much as 10
percent, it said.  First-half earnings before interest and tax were 187
million Swiss francs ($234 million) compared with a loss of 31
million francs a year earlier, Oerlikon said today. Sales rose
29 percent to 2.03 billion francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
