Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL)  was toppled as  India ’s most valuable company for
the first time in four years by  Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  as demand for
the fuel attracted investors.  Coal India, the world’s biggest producer of the fuel, rose
2.8 percent to 397.90 rupees at the close in  Mumbai  yesterday,
valuing the company at $55.35 billion. Reliance, which declined
for the ninth day in the past 10, fell 0.6 percent to 755
rupees, giving it a market capitalization of $54.45 billion.  The state-owned miner has surged 26 percent this year on
demand for coal, used to generate more than half the country’s
electricity. Reliance has slumped 29 percent, the most since
2008, as declining natural gas production curbed profit growth.
The key Sensitive Index has fallen 18 percent this year.  “Coal will continue to be the most widely used fuel for
energy generation for a long time,” Alex Mathews, head of
research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd., said by
phone from the southern city of Kochi. “As long as that
continues and as long as India is growing, there’s no stopping
the  Coal India  story.”  Coal accounted for 53 percent of India’s fuel consumption
in 2010, while oil and gas had a combined share of 40 percent,
according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy.  The world’s third-biggest coal consumer may more than
triple its use in the next two decades to 2 billion metric tons,
according to Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal. India produces
530 million tons of coal a year and imports about 67 million
tons, he said.  Coal Reserves  Coal India had proven resources of 52.55 billion tons, of
which 21.75 billion was extractable as of April 1, 2010,
according to the company’s  website .  “There are no compelling reasons to buy Reliance,” said
Kamlesh Kotak, the Mumbai-based vice-president of research at
Asian Markets Securities Pvt. “Coal India, though, will always
have demand for its produce. Its underlying reserves are huge.”  The federal government  raised  152 billion rupees ($3.3
billion) selling Coal India shares at 245 rupees each in October
in the country’s biggest initial public offering. The miner
increased coal prices in February and was included in the key,
30-member Sensitive Index starting Aug. 8.  The Kolkata-based producer of more than 80 percent of
India’s coal reported a 63 percent increase in profit in the
three months ended June 30 to 41.4 billion rupees. Annual profit
may rise about 10 percent if the sales target of 454 million
tons for this financial year is achieved, according to Chairman
Nirmal Chandra Jha.  Reliance Refining  Coal India’s net income may climb 39 percent to 150.7
billion rupees in the year ending March 31, according to the
average estimate of 34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Gains from crude oil refining helped to boost Reliance’s
net income in the quarter ended June 30 to the highest since the
three months ended December 2007. Quarterly profit may have
peaked, unless gas output rises, because refining margins may
remain at the current level or fall, according to Prashant Kamdar, an analyst with Guiness Securities Ltd. in Kolkata.  Profit at Reliance, which owns the world’s largest oil
refining complex, may rise 18 percent to 227.7 billion rupees in
this fiscal year, according to the mean estimate of 26 analysts.  Output from Reliance’s KG-D6 block, India’s biggest gas
deposit, declined 18 percent in the quarter ended June 30 from a
year earlier to 156.2 billion cubic feet, the company said July
25, without providing a reason.  Reliance is seeking BP Plc’s expertise in deepwater
drilling to boost gas production after agreeing in February to
sell a 30 percent stake in some of its fields to the London-
based company for $7.2 billion.  Reliance surpassed state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp. as
India’s biggest company by market value in February 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
