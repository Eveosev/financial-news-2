Germany will destroy as many as 30
million doses of  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) â€™s Pandemrix swine flu
vaccine valued at 250 million euros ($360 million) that remain
unused a year after the World Health Organization declared the
pandemic over,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said today.  While Pandemrix was ordered to vaccinate some 30 percent of
Germans, less than 10 percent of the population elected to be
vaccinated, the German newspaper reported today, without saying
where it got the information. The vaccine will expire in the
coming weeks and must therefore be destroyed by burning in an
incinerator,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
