InterDigital Inc. surged after
Reuters reported that  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  and  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  are among
technology companies pondering bids for the company’s assets,
citing people familiar with the matter.  InterDigital, which owns about 1,300 patents related to
mobile-phone technology, leaped as much as 12 percent to $71.87
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained about 70
percent since the company said on July 19 it hired Evercore
Partners Inc. and Barclays Capital to help explore a potential
sale to take advantage of demand for wireless patents.  Samsung Electronics Co., Google Inc. and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  have
also been considering whether to bid for InterDigital’s assets,
people familiar with the matter have said in recent weeks. The
stock sank on Aug. 15 on speculation that Google might no longer
be a potential suitor after announcing its $12.5 billion bid for
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., said Philippe Zera, an analyst
at Algorithm Capital in  Santa Clara , California.  “The extent of Monday’s selloff was unwarranted,” said
Zera, whose firm owns shares of InterDigital and recommends
buying the stock. “The stock is recovering.”  InterDigital has said its patents are deeper and stronger
than those Nortel Networks Corp. auctioned earlier this year. A
group led by Apple and Microsoft Corp. won with a $4.5 billion
bid on July 1.  James Etheridge, a spokesman for Nokia, said the company
doesn’t comment on speculation. Emily Kilpatrick, a spokeswoman
for San Diego-based Qualcomm, declined to comment, as did Jack Indekeu, a spokesman for InterDigital.  InterDigital rose $5.53, or 8.6 percent, to $69.56 at 4
p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
