Hungarian shares advanced after
Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said he will take further steps to
rein in the  budget deficit  and as European and U.S. stocks rose.  The benchmark BUX index of shares gained 1.7 percent to
18,630.97 by the 5 p.m. close in Budapest, extending the rally
this week to 3.3 percent. Gedeon  Richter Nyrt ., the country’s
biggest drugmaker, jumped 5.3 percent to 35,800 forint.  The government must fill a hole of “at least” 100 billion
forint ($536 million) as the economy expands more slowly than
the government earlier predicted, Orban told a press conference
today. The measures will affect spending and revenue, Orban
said, adding details will be revealed next month.  “The government’s commitment to defend the deficit target
and take new measures is positive,” Balint Hada, head of
research at Quaestor Zrt., said by phone from Budapest. “The
next question is what the measures will be.”  Hungary targets a shortfall of 2.5 percent of gross
domestic product next year, compared with 4.3 percent in 2010
and a surplus this year because of the effective nationalization
of private-pension funds and temporary taxes on energy,
financial, retail and telecommunication industries.  U.S. stocks advanced, sending the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index higher for the fourth time in five days, as companies from
Staples Inc. to Target Corp. reported earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
