European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said he is afraid of entering a
period of slow growth and low inflation similar to the 1990s
development in  Japan , according to an interview in Austrian
daily newspaper  WirtschaftsBlatt .  Asked if he sees inflationary dangers, Nowotny was quoted
as saying: “My personal fears are focused on a different
direction, a Japanese one.” That means a “long-term period of
limited economic growth combined with low inflation rates,” he
added in the interview.  Nowotny said that while he didn’t expect the global economy
to contract again, he couldn’t rule out that growth would slow
down around the world, beginning with the U.S. “From today’s
point of view, another recession such as a double dip is
unlikely,” he said. “What can’t be ruled out is that we will
see a global economic growth slowdown.”  While  Europe ’s “stability core,” including  Germany ,
 Austria  and some of its neighbors, is still developing
positively, “we have learned that a permanent decoupling can’t
be expected,” he said.  Nowotny, who also heads Austria’s central bank, said he
didn’t see the risk of an “abrupt crash” comparable to the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings in 2008. “The situation is
tense but not acute,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
