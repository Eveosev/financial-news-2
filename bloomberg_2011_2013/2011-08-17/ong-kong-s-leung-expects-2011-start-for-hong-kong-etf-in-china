An exchange traded fund to invest in
 Hong Kong  stocks and a plan to allow qualified Hong Kong
companies to invest in domestic Chinese securities with yuan
will be launched before the end of 2011, Julia Leung, Hong
Kong’s undersecretary of financial services and the treasury
said.  The plans were unveiled by Chinese Vice Premier  Li Keqiang 
at a forum in Hong Kong yesterday. The investment program will
be separate from the existing Qualified Institutional Investor
program that allows overseas firms to invest directly in Chinese
securities, Leung said.  “The ETF will be listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
markets,” Leung said in a telephone interview yesterday. “That
would allow indirect access to the Hong Kong stock market for
Chinese investors. For sure that would benefit the Hong Kong
stock market.”  China will also allow mainland-based companies to sell yuan
bonds in Hong Kong, she said. Such issuance will be capped at 50
billion yuan ($7.8 billion) this year, Leung said, citing Li.  The total quota for the program to allow Hong Kong
companies to invest in Chinese securities will be 20 billion
yuan, which Leung thinks will be raised, she said. The companies
will have to apply for licenses to make those investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
