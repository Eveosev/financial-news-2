Syria  may export 500,000 metric
tons of hard wheat produced locally this year and import an
equal quantity of soft wheat after winning government approval,
state-owned  Tishreen  newspaper reported, citing Suleiman Al
Nasser, the head of state-run General Establishment for Cereal
Processing and Trade.  The export of wheat will help supply the treasury with hard
currency, according to the report. Syria sold 500,000 tons of
hard wheat in 2009 and bought 1.2 million tons of soft wheat,
Nassar said, according to Tishreen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
