Lookers Plc (LOOK) , a U.K. car dealership
and auto parts supplier, said first-half profit rose 2.6 percent
as its aftermarket parts division produced a strong performance
in a “challenging market environment.”  Net income rose to 15.5 million pounds ($25.5 million), or
3.96 pence a share, from 15.1 million pounds, or 3.85 pence per
share, a year earlier, the Manchester, England-based company
said today in a statement distributed by the Regulatory News
Service. Sales rose 1.4 percent to 1 billion pounds.  Lookers has dropped 11.8 percent since Trefick Ltd., Moor
Park Capital Partners LLP and Brett Palos Capital No. 2 Ltd.
withdrew an approach about a possible offer on June 29.  “Our motor division produced a creditable result
notwithstanding the weak new-car market and the parts division
produced another record trading performance,” Lookers Chief
Executive Officer Peter Jones said in the statement. The results
mean the company can “significantly increase” dividend
payments and “pursue strategic growth opportunities.”  Lookers increased its interim dividend 33 percent to 0.8
pence, according to the statement.  For Related News and Information  To contact the reporter on this story:
