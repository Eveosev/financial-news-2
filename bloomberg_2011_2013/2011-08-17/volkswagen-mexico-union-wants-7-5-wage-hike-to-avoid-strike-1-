The Mexican union for workers at
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest carmaker, are demanding a pay
increase of 7.5 percent to avoid a strike tomorrow, a union
official said.  The union also wants annual payments of 661 pesos ($54) for
school supplies and permanent positions created for 600
temporary workers, said Arturo Monter, the union spokesman, in a
telephone interview from Puebla state.  The union is threatening to strike at Volkswagen’s plant in
Puebla, Mexico, where the Jetta compact, the carmaker’s best-
selling U.S. model, is built.  “We expect a company response during the afternoon or late
night,” Monter said. ”We can change our demands if the company
gives us an attractive proposal.”  Volkswagen Mexico has 15,700 workers, 11,840 of which
belong to the union, according to the carmaker’s  Mexico  press
office.  The plant, which opened in 1967, is working at full
capacity and produces 2,150 units per day. From January through
July the factory had output of about 295,000 vehicles, the
company said. The factory produces the Jetta, Beetle and Golf
models.  VW union initially wanted a 13 percent pay-and-benefit
increase. The company has offered 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
