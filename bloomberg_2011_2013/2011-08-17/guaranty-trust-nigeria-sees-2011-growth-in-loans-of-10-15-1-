Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) , Nigeria’s
second-biggest lender by market value, is on course to achieve a
loan-growth target of between 10 percent and 15 percent this
year, said Chief Executive Officer Segun Agbaje.  The lender plans to keep its bad debts at less than 5
percent of its loans this year and in 2012, he said today during
a conference call from Lagos, the commercial capital.  Nigerian lenders are starting to expand their loan books
after a reduction in credit growth, which followed a debt crisis
in 2008 and 2009 that threatened the industry with collapse. The
 Central Bank  of Nigeria fired the chief executives of eight of
the country’s lenders and bailed out the industry with 620
billion naira ($4 billion). Guaranty was not among banks.  In 2010, the Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria  was formed
to buy the bad debts. Guaranty has sold 46.7 billion naira to
the company, known as Amcon, Agbaje said. Guaranty will not sell
any more loans to Amcon and in the future will “work” with the
customer if issues arise, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
