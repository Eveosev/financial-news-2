Namibia , the world’s biggest miner
of offshore diamonds, has withdrawn a proposal to increase the
corporate tax rate on mining companies to 44 percent from 37.5
percent, Deputy Finance Minister Calle Schlettwein said.  The government will instead propose a windfall tax when
international prices for the commodities are high, Schlettwein
told reporters today in Windhoek, the capital, without giving
further details on the rate or at what price level the tax will
be introduced.  It will also defer removing the zero-rating for value added
tax on mineral exports and cut a proposed levy on exports from 5
percent to between 0 percent and 2 percent depending on the
industry, he said. A capital gains tax is still expected to be
implemented, Schlettwein said.  The government announced on July 22 plans to raise
corporate tax rates on mining companies other than diamond
producers from the next financial year, sparking opposition from
the country’s Chamber of Mines and the Namibia Chamber of
Commerce and Industry. Diamond miners are taxed at 55 percent.
Namibia is the world’s fourth-largest uranium producer and also
has deposits of gold, coal and copper.  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) , the world’s second-biggest mining company,
 Extract Resources Ltd. (EXT)  and  De Beers  have operations in the
southern African country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
