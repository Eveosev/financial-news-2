Taiwan’s dollar retreated from a
two-week high after European leaders rejected a rescue fund to
end the region’s debt crisis, fueling concern the global
economic recovery will stall.  Government bonds  were steady.  The currency halted a three-day advance and the local stock
index retreated after French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  rejected an expansion of the 440
billion-euro ($633 billion) rescue fund and rebuffed calls for
joint euro borrowing to end the debt crisis. Taiwan’s government
will sell NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of 30-year bonds at an
auction today.  “The situation in  Europe  continues to worry investors, and
it doesn’t look like there’ll be a solution anytime soon,” said
Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in
Taipei. “Traders are being careful before the bond sale. The
global economic outlook is quite uncertain at the moment, and
that’ll affect bidders’ demand for the new bonds.”  Taiwan ’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$28.969 against
its U.S. counterpart as of 9:29 a.m. local time, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.860 yesterday, the strongest
level since Aug. 4.  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016, the most-
traded securities, was 1.075 percent, from 1.079 percent
yesterday, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.382 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
