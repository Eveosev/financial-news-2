Royal Dutch Shell Plc offered a
cargo of  North Sea  Forties crude without securing a buyer and
sold a consignment of Russian Urals for delivery to Rotterdam.  Angola , Africa’s second-largest oil producer, plans to
export 52 crude cargoes in October, unchanged from September,
according to a revised preliminary loading plan obtained by
Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Shell offered a shipment of Forties for loading on Sept. 5
to Sept. 7 at a premium of 70 cents to the Dated Brent
Benchmark, according to a survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts trading window. Yesterday Vitol Group sold
a shipment to Statoil ASA at a 40-cent premium.  Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the
window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days was at 45 cents more
than Dated Brent, the highest since July 25, up from 23 cents
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for October settlement traded at $110.88 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the
window, up from $109.75 yesterday. The November contract was at
$110.61 a barrel, 27 cents less than October.  Shell expects divers to close a leaking oil valve at a
North Sea platform today, a company official said by e-mail.  Mediterranean/Urals  Shell sold 100,000 metric tons of Russian Urals to Preem AB
for delivery to Rotterdam on Sept. 2 to Sept. 6, at discount of
40 cents to Dated. Yesterday Shell sold a cargo at 10 cents
below Dated.  Urals was at 30 cents a barrel less than to Dated Brent in
northwest Europe, the highest since Sept. 17, 2010, compared
with a discount of 45 cents yesterday, while the grade was
priced in the Mediterranean at a 11-month high of 45 cents
cheaper than the benchmark, according to Bloomberg data.  West  Africa   The revision of Angola loading program, which includes one
extra cargo of new Pazflor crude, raised total volume for
October to 49.6 million barrels, or 1.6 million barrels a day.  Total SA’s Pazflor project will export its first cargoes in
two months. Total will load a consignment for Oct. 1 to Oct. 2
and Statoil ASA, another equity holder of the field, will get an
Oct. 17 to Oct. 18 shipment, the plan showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
