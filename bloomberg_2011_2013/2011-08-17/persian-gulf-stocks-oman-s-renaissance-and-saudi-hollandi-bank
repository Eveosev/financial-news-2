Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  dropped
0.1 percent at 1:09 p.m. in the emirate. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General
Index (ADSMI)  was little changed and Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share
Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.3 percent.  The following shares were active in the Persian Gulf
region. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  Renaissance Services SAOG (RNSS)   tumbled to the lowest
since April 2009, falling 6.3 percent to 0.524 rial. The Omani
provider of services to the oil and gas industry said only one
of the management changes at its unit Topaz Group, which in
March delayed a share sale in London, was linked to financial
fraud.  Saudi Hollandi Bank (AAAL)   lost the most in more than a
week, decreasing 2.5 percent to 27 riyals. The Saudi Arabian
lender’s share-price estimate was lowered yesterday to 36.43
riyals at  Beltone Financial Holding. (BTFH)   To contact the reporter on this story:
