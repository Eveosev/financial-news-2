Winifred Jiau, a former consultant
with expert networking firm Primary Global Research LLC, lost a
post-trial bid to overturn her convictions on charges related to
insider-trading.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff denied Jiauâ€™s motion for an
acquittal or a new trial in federal court in  Manhattan , where
she was convicted June 20 of conspiracy and securities fraud.  The jury found her guilty of passing information regarding
earnings and other matters on  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)  and Marvell
Technology Group Ltd. to hedge fund managers Noah Freeman, a
former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager, and Samir Barai, founder of New York-based Barai Capital Management LP.  Jiau, of Fremont, California, faces as long as 25 years in
prison when she is sentenced by Rakoff.  The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
