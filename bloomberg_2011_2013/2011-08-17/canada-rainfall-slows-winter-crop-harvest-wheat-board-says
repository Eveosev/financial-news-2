Scattered rains across the Canadian
prairies last week slowed the winter-wheat and pulse harvest,
while helping late-seeded crops in some dry growing areas, the
Canadian Wheat Board said.  Saskatchewan, where rain was heaviest, received as much as
6 centimeters (2.4 inches) in some areas, while central Alberta
got as much as 2.5 centimeters, the board said today in a
statement on its  website . Manitoba was mostly dry. The winter-
grain harvest is “heading towards completion” in southern
Manitoba, and farmers also are collecting spring crops.  “Cereal crops are catching up on development in most of
the prairies, though they will require weeks of warm, dry
weather in many parts of the prairies,” the board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
