Iranian Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi
urged the nation’s  energy industry  managers to speed up delayed
oil and gas projects, saying his ministry is seeking “special
authority” to circumvent sanctions that hamper development.  “I advise the managers of Iran’s oil industry to take
necessary and essential decisions without fear to speed up their
activities,” Qasemi was quoted as saying in a report by the
state-run Mehr news agency.  Iran is the second-largest crude producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and oil is its
main source of export earnings. International sanctions over its
nuclear program have deterred many foreign companies from
investing in the country, contributing to a stagnation of its
energy industry.  “We need special authority at our disposal to be able to
circumvent the sanctions,” he said today in a meeting with
managers in southern  Iran . “Proposals have been made toward
this and we hope that they can soon be implemented so as to
achieve important planned objectives.”  A decrease in delays to oil and gas projects, financial
discipline and the developments of fields that Iran shares with
its neighbors are the ministry’s new top policies, Qasemi said
in the Mehr report.  Qasemi, who formerly headed the engineering arm of Iran’s
Revolutionary Guard Corps, was approved by the parliament as Oil
Minister on Aug. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
