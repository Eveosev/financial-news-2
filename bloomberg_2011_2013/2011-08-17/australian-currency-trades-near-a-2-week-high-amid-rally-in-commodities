The Australian dollar fell from a
two-week high against its U.S. counterpart as stocks plummeted
damping investor demand for risk-associated assets.  Australia ’s currency depreciated against the yen after oil
and copper prices dropped, hurting the outlook for the nation’s
commodity exports.  New Zealand ’s dollar, known as the kiwi,
slipped from its highest level in more than a week versus the
greenback, halting a five-day advance.  “It’s a mirror image of happening in the equity markets,”
said Dean Popplewell, head analyst in Toronto at the online
currency-trading firm Oanda Corp.  The Australian currency slid 1.8 percent to $1.0359 at 1:41
p.m. in  New York  from $1.0550 yesterday, when it reached
$1.0602, its highest level since Aug. 4. The Aussie dropped 1.9
percent to 79.26 yen from 80.82 yen. New Zealand’s dollar fell
1.9 percent to 82.15 U.S. cents from 83.74 cents yesterday, when
it touched 84.26 cents, its strongest level since Aug. 8. It
declined 2 percent to 62.86 yen from 64.14 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares slumped 1.7
percent. The  Standard & Poor’s  500 index fell 4.6 percent. Crude
oil for September delivery dropped 5.8 percent, and copper on
the London Metal Exchange fell as much as 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
