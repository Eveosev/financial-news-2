A second year of drought in  Russia ’s
Siberian Altai region may reduce the local grain crop by 13
percent to 3.5 million metric tons this year, said Alexander
Vais, director of the regional branch of  Russia’s Peasants and
Farmers Union .  Last year Russia suffered its worst drought in at least 50
years, cutting the national grain crop by 37 percent to 60.9
million tons. Altai’s grain harvest came to 6 million tons in
2009, Vais told Bloomberg by phone today. That was about 6
percent of the country’s 97 million-ton grain and legume harvest
in 2009, according to data from Russia’s Federal State
Statistics Service.  This year rain was scarce in the Altai region from about 10
days into May until the end of June, and farmers were sowing
seeds in dry soil, according to Vais. Grain failed to sprout on
about 300,000 hectares (741,315 acres) of fields, he said.  “Farms are very concerned about very insignificant
harvests,” Vais said. Local yields were between 500 kilograms
(1,102 pounds) and 600 kilograms a hectare for third- and
fourth-grade wheat, he said. That compares with an average
national figure of 3,150 kilograms so far this year, according
to Agriculture Ministry data.  Altai’s farmers are financially constrained on the eve of
winter sowing for the next season because they must repay loans
at the same time that reduced yields and lower wheat prices of
4,500 rubles ($157) a ton have made raising funds more
difficult, Vais said. After transportation costs, farmers are
getting 3,700 rubles a ton for wheat, he said.  “We need state support to have loans extended, preserve
loan terms and get subsidies, and we hope the government will
start intervention grain purchases to support grain prices,”
Vais said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
