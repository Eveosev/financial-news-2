U.S. stock-index futures gained,
indicating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will climb for the
fourth time in five days, as  Staples Inc. (SPLS)  and  Target Corp. (TGT) 
reported earnings that topped estimates.  Staples, the office-supply retailer, climbed 9.6 percent
and Target, the second-largest U.S. discount retailer, jumped
6.3 percent.  Dell Inc. (DELL)  slumped 7.1 percent as the world’s
second-largest personal-computer maker reported second-quarter
revenue that missed estimates and cut its sales forecast.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next
month advanced 0.3 percent to 1,195.3 at 8:16 a.m. in New York,
having earlier fallen as much as 0.7 percent. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures increased 26 points, or 0.2 percent,
to 11,413.  “Results from retailers like Target and Staples are part
of a data set showing if we’re heading for a recession,” said
Morten Kongshaug, chief equity strategist at Danske Bank A/S in
Copenhagen. “If people are still shopping, businesses won’t lay
off workers and we won’t arrive at a recession.”  The  S&P 500  has fallen 13 percent since April 29 on concern
the economy is slowing and  Europe ’s debt crisis is widening.
Gauges of S&P 500 companies least-tied to economic growth,
including utilities and sellers of consumer staples, fell less
than the index during the slump, losing 1.7 percent and 4.5
percent, respectively. The gauge slipped 1 percent yesterday
after rallying 7.5 percent over the previous three days.  S&P Valuation  The slump has left the S&P 500 trading at 12 times the
estimated earnings of its constituent companies, below the
average ratio of 14.6 during the past five years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Staples gained 9.6 percent to $15.59 in early  New York 
trading as it projected earnings per share for the year of $1.39
to $1.45, beating the $1.37 average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  Target rallied 6.3 percent to $52.50. The retailer said net
income rose to $704 million, or $1.03 a share, from $679
million, or 92 cents, a year earlier. Analysts projected 97
cents, the average of 19 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Dell slid 7.1 percent to $14.68 as the computer maker
reported second-quarter revenue of $15.7 billion, missing the
average analyst estimate of $15.8 billion. The company projected
sales growth of 1 percent to 5 percent this year, down from a
previous range of 5 percent to 9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
