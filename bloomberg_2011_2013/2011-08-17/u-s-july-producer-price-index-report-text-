The following is the text of the U.S.
producer price report for July released by the Labor Department.  The Producer Price Index for finished goods rose 0.2
percent in July, seasonally adjusted, the  U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics  reported today. This advance followed a 0.4-
percent decrease in June and a 0.2-percent rise in May. At
the earlier stages of processing, prices received by
manufacturers of intermediate goods moved up 0.2 percent in
July, and the crude goods index declined 1.2 percent. On an
unadjusted basis, prices for finished goods moved up 7.2
percent for the 12 months ended July 2011.  Stage-of-Processing Analysis  Finished goods  In July, the advance in the finished goods index was led
by prices for finished goods less foods and energy, which
rose 0.4 percent. Also contributing to higher finished goods
prices, the index for finished consumer foods increased 0.6
percent. By contrast, prices for finished energy goods
declined 0.6 percent.  Finished core:  The index for finished goods less foods and energy moved
up 0.4 percent in July, the eighth consecutive rise. Nearly
one-quarter of the July advance can be attributed to a 2.8-
percent increase in prices for tobacco products. The indexes
for light motor trucks and pharmaceutical preparations also
contributed significantly to the rise in the finished core
index.  Finished foods:  In July, the index for finished consumer foods advanced
0.6 percent for the second consecutive month. A major
contributor to the July increase was beef and veal prices,
which moved up 2.7 percent. Higher prices for fresh fruits
and melons also played a significant role in the finished
foods advance.  Finished energy:  The index for finished energy goods moved down 0.6
percent in July, the second straight decline. Prices for
gasoline, which fell 2.8 percent, led the July decrease.  Intermediate goods  The  Producer Price Index  for intermediate materials,
supplies, and components advanced 0.2 percent in July after
no change in June. The increase was broad based, with prices
for intermediate goods less foods and energy moving up 0.2
percent, the intermediate energy goods index advancing 0.4
percent, and prices for intermediate foods and feeds edging
up 0.1 percent. On a 12-month basis, the index for
intermediate goods climbed 11.6 percent, the largest increase
since a 15.3-percent rise in September 2008.  Intermediate core:  The index for intermediate goods less foods and energy
moved up 0.2 percent in July, the smallest advance since a
similar rise in September 2010. Over twenty percent of the
July increase can be traced to higher prices for plastic
resins and materials, which rose 2.1 percent. The indexes for
copper and brass mill shapes and for rubber and rubber
products also contributed to higher intermediate core prices.  Intermediate energy:  Intermediate energy goods prices moved up 0.4 percent in
July following a 0.8-percent decline in June. The index for
liquefied petroleum gas led this advance, increasing 2.5
percent. Higher prices for industrial electric power also
contributed to the rise in the intermediate energy goods
index.  Intermediate foods:  The index for intermediate foods and feeds inched up 0.1
percent in July, the second consecutive monthly increase. The
July advance can be traced primarily to prices for natural,
processed, and imitation cheese, which moved up 6.3 percent.  Crude goods  The Producer Price Index for crude materials for further
processing fell 1.2 percent in July. For the 3-month period
ending in July, prices for crude materials declined 5.8
percent following a 6.2-percent rise from January to April.
In July, the monthly decrease in the crude goods index is
mostly attributable to prices for crude energy materials,
which fell 2.6 percent. Also contributing to the July
decrease, prices for crude foodstuffs and feedstuffs declined
0.8 percent. By contrast, the index for crude nonfood
materials less energy advanced 0.7 percent.  Crude energy:  The index for crude energy materials decreased 2.6
percent in July. From April to July, prices for crude energy
materials fell 11.5 percent subsequent to a 3.5-percent rise
for the 3 months ended in April. In July, the monthly
decrease was mostly the result of a 5.2-percent decline in
crude petroleum prices. A decrease in the index for coal also
contributed to lower prices for crude energy materials.  Crude foods:  Prices for crude foodstuffs and feedstuffs fell 0.8
percent in July. For the 3 months ending in July, crude food
prices moved down 3.3 percent. This decrease followed an 11.0-
percent advance from January to April. A 9.7-percent decline
in prices for slaughter poultry led the monthly decrease in
July. Lower prices for fresh and dry vegetables also
contributed to the decline in the crude foods index.  Crude core:  The index for crude nonfood materials less energy
climbed 0.7 percent in July. From April to July, crude core
prices rose 0.8 percent following a 2.7-percent advance in
the prior 3-month period. A 7.0-percent increase in prices
for copper ores was a major contributor to the monthly
increase in July. An advance in the index for corn also
contributed to the rise in crude core prices.  Services Analysis  Trade industries:  The Producer Price Index for the net output of total
trade industries fell 0.9 percent in July after no change in
June. (Trade indexes measure changes in margins received by
wholesalers and retailers.) Almost half of the July decrease
can be traced to margins received by gasoline stations, which
dropped 11.7 percent. Lower margins received by grocery
stores and merchant wholesalers of durable goods also were
major factors in the decline in the total trade industries
index.  Transportation and warehousing industries:  The Producer Price Index for the net output of
transportation and warehousing industries moved up 0.2
percent in July, the smallest advance since a similar gain in
December 2010. Over ninety percent of the July increase is
attributable to a 1.1-percent rise in prices received by the
scheduled passenger air transportation industry. Higher
prices received by the industries for freight transportation
arrangement and pipeline transportation of refined petroleum
products also contributed to the advance in the
transportation and warehousing industries index.  Traditional  service industries :  The Producer Price Index for the net output of total
traditional service industries inched up 0.1 percent in July,
the second consecutive increase. About two-thirds of the July
advance can be traced to prices received by the hospitals
industry group, which moved up 0.4 percent. Increases in the
indexes for automotive equipment rental and leasing and for
management consulting services also were factors in the rise
in the total traditional service industries index.  The Producer Price Index for August 2011 is scheduled to
be released on Wednesday, September 14, 2011 at 8:30 a.m.
(EDT).  Resampling of Industries  Effective with this release, the Producer Price Index
(PPI) includes data for 33 resampled industries (noted below)
classified according to the North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS). The Bureau of Labor Statistics
periodically updates the sample of producers providing data
for the PPI to reflect current conditions more accurately
when the structure, membership, technology, or product mix of
an industry shifts. The first results of this systematic
process were published in July 1986. Subsequent efforts have
been completed at 6-month intervals.  For information on specific index additions, deletions,
and recodes that are effective with this semiannual update,
