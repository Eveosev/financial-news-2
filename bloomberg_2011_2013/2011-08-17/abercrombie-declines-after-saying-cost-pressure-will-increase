Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) , the teen-
clothing retailer, fell 8.7 percent for the second-biggest drop
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after company executives said
expenses will continue to rise this year.  Pressure from increasing commodity costs will be greater in
the second half, Chief Executive Officer Michael Jeffries told
investors on a conference call. Earlier today, the  New Albany ,
Ohio-based company reported that second-quarter sales rose 23
percent on U.S. back-to-school purchases and gains in  Europe .  “There were high expectations after the news about sales
and then they indicated on the call that there would be pricing
pressures in the second half of the year,” said Betty Chen, an
analyst at San Francisco-based Wedbush Securities with a
“neutral” rating on the shares. “This was confusing and
disappointing to investors who expected they would have more
solid pricing power.”  Abercrombie and other clothing companies are contending
with rising prices of materials such as cotton and oil and
higher labor costs in  Asia . Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Ramsden said on the call that the company expects a “double-
digit” increase in second-half expenses, without giving a
figure.  The company’s shares declined $6.15 to $64.87 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have gained
13 percent this year. Dell Inc.’s 10 percent drop was today’s
largest in the  S&P 500 .  To contact the reporter on this story:
