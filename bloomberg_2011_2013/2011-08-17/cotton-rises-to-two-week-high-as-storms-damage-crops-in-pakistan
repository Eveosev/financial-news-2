Cotton rose to a two-week high as
unusually heavy rain devastated crops in  Pakistan , the fourth-
largest grower.  Storms in the Sindh and Punjab regions during the past week
may have damaged as much as 1.5 million bales on fields farmers
have yet to harvest, said Mian Rashid Mehmood, the vice chairman
of the  Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association . The farm ministry in
June set a target to produce 15 million bales nationwide. Last
year’s crop was reduced by the nation’s worst-ever flood.  “Some traders are starting to take note of excessive rains
in parts of Pakistan,”  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in
Mandeville, Louisiana, wrote today in an e-mailed report.
“While there are no predictions of a repeat of last year’s
disaster, some are likely taking a ‘shoot first and ask
questions later’ attitude.”  Cotton for December delivery jumped 3.97 cents, or 3.8
percent, to settle at $1.0782 a pound at 2:34 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . Earlier, the fiber rose by the 4-cent
exchange limit to $1.0785, the highest since Aug. 2.  In Pakistan, a bale weighs 375 pounds, or 170 kilograms. In
the U.S., the world’s largest exporter and third-biggest grower,
a bale weighs 480 pounds.  China  is the largest producer,
followed by India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
