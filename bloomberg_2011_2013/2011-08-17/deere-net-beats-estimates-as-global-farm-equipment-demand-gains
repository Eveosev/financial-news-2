Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest
farm-equipment maker, posted fiscal third-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates and raised its full-year earnings
forecast as global demand improved.  Net income gained 15 percent to $712.3 million, or $1.69 a
share, in the quarter through July, from $617 million, or $1.44,
a year earlier, Moline, Illinois-based Deere said today in a
statement. The average estimate of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey was for earnings of $1.67 a share. Sales rose 22 percent
to $8.37 billion from $6.84 billion.  Profit will be $2.7 billion in the year ending Oct. 31,
more than the $2.65 billion forecast in May. The average
estimate of eight analysts in the Bloomberg survey was for net
income of $2.72 billion.  Deere is aiming to double annual sales to $50 billion by
2018 and raise the proportion of revenue from outside the U.S.
and  Canada  to 50 percent from 35 percent in fiscal 2010.
Agriculture industry sales in western and central Europe will
climb 10 percent to 15 percent in its current financial year,
Deere said.  “Deere’s array of over 100 new products in the region and
a renewed focus on its dealer network are contributing to the
company’s outperformance in key countries,”  Ann Duignan , a New
York-based analyst for JPMorgan Chase & Co. who rates the shares
“overweight,” said in a report on Aug. 15.  Shares of Deere dropped $1.34, or 1.8 percent, to $75.16 as
of 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday. They have declined 9.5 percent this year, while the
Standard and Poor’s 500 Index has fallen 5.2 percent.  Corn Rally  Tractor sales in Western  Europe  rose about 14 percent in
the first half of 2011 as dairy and livestock markets improved,
Duluth, Georgia-based manufacturer Agco Corp. said last month.  Corn futures in Chicago have gained 72 percent over the
last 12 months while soybeans have increased 31 percent as a
drought in the U.S. reduced yields and tightened crop
inventories. U.S. cash receipts from major crops, an indicator
for equipment sales, will rise 23 percent to $149.6 billion in
the 2011-2012 crop year from a year earlier, according to a
JPMorgan estimate.  “These projections continue to support strong farm income
expectations for the year and continued equipment demand,”
Duignan said in an Aug. 11 report.  (Deere is scheduled to hold a conference call for analysts
at 10 a.m. New York time. Dial: +1-630-395-0143, pin 9518.)  To contact the reporters on this story:
