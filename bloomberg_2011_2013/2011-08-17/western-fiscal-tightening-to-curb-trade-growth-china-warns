China’s trade growth will slow in
the second half and fiscal tightening in western nations means
their demand will wane, Commerce Minister  Chen Deming  said.  “Western demand will shrink as they need to tighten their
fiscal policies,” Chen said at an economic forum in  Hong Kong 
today. Trade growth will slow “a bit,” Chen said.  Developed nations from the U.S. to  Europe  are struggling to
rein in debt burdens and sustain growth as lowered interest
rates limit room for more monetary stimulus and unemployment
remains elevated. U.K. jobless claims increased the most in more
than two years in July, government data showed today.  “We still have confidence in China’s trade performance in
the second half, as our pace of growth will be faster than the
world’s average rate,” Chen said.  Besides weaker demand, Chinese exporters face rising labor
costs and a strengthening yuan, the official said.  He urged “responsible” fiscal and monetary policies
around the world, saying that  China  “will focus on doing its
own things right.”  China’s trade surplus surged to $31.5 billion in July, the
highest level in more than two years, as exports rose to a
record. Trade growth will slow “a bit” in the second half,
Chen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
