The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. media, with clickable links to the Web.  Wenger Punishment?  Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  may face further disciplinary
action from UEFA after communicating with his team’s bench in
last night’s Champions League playoff game against Udinese, the
 British Broadcasting Corp . reported.  Wenger, who was serving a touchline ban held over from last
year, watched from the stands as Arsenal won the first-leg game
1-0.  Sneijder Pay Cut?  Inter Milan’s Wesley Sneijder has reduced his pay demands
to ensure his move to  Manchester United  goes through,  the Sun 
reported.  Sneijder, who wanted 200,000 pounds ($329,000) a week, is
ready to take 60,000 pounds less, the newspaper added.  Barton Targeted  West Ham may revive its interest in Joey Barton, the  Daily
Mirror  reported.  The Hammers originally discussed trying to sign the
midfielder earlier this month after Newcastle said they’d made
him available on a free transfer, the paper said.  City Snub  Manchester City  will block any attempts by Aston Villa
manager Alex McLeish to take James Milner and Adam Johnson on
loan, according to  the Sun.   McLeish asked about the players during talks over
goalkeeper Shay Given’s move to Villa from City last month, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
