Wheat futures rose to a two-month
high on speculation that dry weather in the U.S. Great Plains
will cut acreage of winter crops set to be planted next month.  Parts of  Texas ,  Oklahoma  and southern  Kansas  have had a
quarter of the normal amount of rainfall in the past 30 days,
the  National Weather Service  said. U.S. output of hard, red-
winter wheat, grown primarily in the Great Plains, may drop 22
percent to 794.4 million  bushels  from last year because dry
weather has persisted since late 2010, the Department of
Agriculture said.  “It hasn’t been a good growing season, and it doesn’t look
like it’s going to be a good planting season,” Jon Marcus, the
president of Lakefront Futures and Options, LLC in Chicago, said
in a telephone interview.  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 6 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $7.58 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $7.6775, the highest
for a most-active contract since June 14. The grain has climbed
11 percent in the past year.  Planting of hard, red-winter wheat, the most common variety
grown in the U.S., usually starts in September. The grain goes
dormant until February or March and is harvested beginning in
June. It’s used to make bread.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest wheat exporter. The grain
is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $13 billion in 2010,
behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
