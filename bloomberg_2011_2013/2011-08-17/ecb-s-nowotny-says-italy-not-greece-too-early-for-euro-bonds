European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said Italy’s primary budget
surplus, its industrial infrastructure and its austerity program
show that it can’t be compared with  Greece , according to an
interview with Austrian daily newspaper  WirtschaftsBlatt .  Italy is a country that “can present itself as capable of
being productive,” he was quoted as saying. “However, its
structural reforms need time and you also need time to regain
the trust of the markets.”  While it is “legitimate” to discuss joint euro area
bonds, Nowotny said that policy makers should focus on
implementing decisions made at a European Union summit last
month.  “I want to warn against introducing a new debate every
week,” he told the paper. “My priority would be to implement
forcefully the resolutions” of the summit, he said, adding that
the question of euro bonds “is not yet ready to be decided.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
