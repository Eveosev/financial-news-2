A group of 19 opposition parties in
 Guinea  called for the country’s electoral commission to be
dismissed before a parliamentary vote after missing deadlines
during last year’s presidential poll, said spokesman Mamadou
Mouctar Diallo.  “The electoral commission lost credibility,” he told
reporters today in Conakry, the capital. He cited the
appointment of Siaka Toumany Sangare, an army general from  Mali ,
as interim head of the commission, less than a month before the
Nov. 7 presidential runoff. That second-round poll was delayed
at least twice and took place more than four months after the
first.  Guinea , the world’s biggest bauxite exporter, will hold a
parliamentary election in the fourth quarter, Alhassane Conde,
minister of territorial administration and decentralization,
said today.  “If we want to hold peaceful parliamentary elections in a
reasonable deadline, we must appoint new commissioners,” said
Diallo, who was farming minister during the transitional
government.  Dismissing the commission could lead to delays in the
lawmakers’ election, said Thierno Saidou Bayo, spokesman for the
commission, by phone today. “Dissolution of CENI at the moment
is not the best way,” he said, using the commission’s French
acronym.  To contact the reporter on this story:
