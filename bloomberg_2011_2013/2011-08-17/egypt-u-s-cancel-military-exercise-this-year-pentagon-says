The U.S. and  Egypt  have called off
their biggest military exercise planned for this year because of
the Middle Eastern country’s government transition.  Exercise  Bright Star , usually held in odd-numbered years,
rehearses coordination and joint operations between the two
nations and a half dozen other militaries. The U.S. and Egypt
next year will begin planning for a 2013 exercise, said Marine
Corps Major Chris Perrine, a Pentagon spokesman.  “The Egyptian government and U.S. decided to postpone it
for 2011 based on mutual agreement in light of ongoing
transition events and the military leadership serving in an
interim executive role” in Egypt, Perrine said in an e-mail
today.  The two nations are recalibrating their defense ties in the
wake of Egypt’s “Arab Spring” uprisings, which deposed
President  Hosni Mubarak , a longtime U.S. ally. Egypt’s military
has been governing the country until elections scheduled later
this year.  An Egyptian military delegation that visits the U.S. twice
a year held talks at the Pentagon in July, the first visit since
the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces assumed interim control
from Mubarak.  The U.S. has continued to provide the $1.3 billion in
military aid scheduled for 2011. U.S. military assistance to
Egypt is based on its 1979 signing of the Camp David peace
treaty with Israel.  “The  United States  and Egypt enjoy a strong and friendly
partnership,” Perrine said in the e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
