One person died and three were
seriously injured in  Croatia  after gale-force winds and rain
blew down trees and roofs in the capital Zagreb and along the
Adriatic coast.  Cyclone Teodor, named by Crometeo, a Split-based
meteorological institute, was created by bad weather in northern
 Europe  and formed overnight as a secondary storm over the
northern Adriatic, Crometeo said on its website.  The storm brought damaging waves and high winds, reaching
200 kilometers (124 miles) per hour along the Adriatic coast and
causing traffic suspensions on land and sea. A 46-year-old man
was killed by a falling tree in Novi Marof, north of the
capital, while hundreds of trees were ripped out in Zagreb,
Croatian Radio said.  In neighboring Slovenia, high winds in the Alps and along
the coast blew off roofs and damaged cars, while rivers Krka and
Ljubljanica swelled with heavy rains, according to local  weather
forecasts .  To contact the reporters on this story:
