Private telecommunications companies
in Costa Rica are at a disadvantage to the state-run operator
two years after a government monopoly ended, said Victor Garcia,
an executive with  America Movil SAB’s (AMXL)  local unit.  “The playing field has not been leveled,” said Garcia,
the head of regulatory services at Claro, in an interview today
in San Jose, Costa Rica. “There are institutional asymmetries
that operate fundamentally against the newcomers.”  Claro currently holds 20 percent market share in Costa Rica
and has some 1.2 million clients, Garcia said. The company’s
reach is limited by restrictions at the municipal level on
installing infrastructure and a more limited radio spectrum to
provide data services compared to state-run ICE, Garcia said.  ICE has “50 years of offering first-class
telecommunications” in Costa Rica, said Elbert Duran, the
company’s communications director, via e-mail.  Claro, the first private operator to enter the Costa Rica
market in late 2011, has expressed interest in the potential
auction of an additional 70 MHZ of bandwidth that was originally
offered in 2010 but was never released, Garcia said.  The total number of mobile users in Costa Rica has
multiplied by 3.4 since the market opened two years ago, Foreign
Trade Minister Anabel Gonzalez told reporters today, without
giving exact figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
