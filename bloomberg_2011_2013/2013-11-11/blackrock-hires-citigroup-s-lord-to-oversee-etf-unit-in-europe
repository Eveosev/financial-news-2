BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
provider of exchange-traded funds, hired Rachel Lord from
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  to oversee its iShares ETF unit in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa.  Lord, who was global head of corporate equity derivatives
at Citigroup, will be based in London and report to Mark
Wiedman, global head of iShares, according to a statement today
from New York-based BlackRock. Lord will replace Joe Linhares,
who will return to the U.S. and coordinate the firm’s activities
with its largest retail distribution partners.  BlackRock, which oversees $891 billion in ETF assets
globally, is seeking to expand its ETF business in Europe and
acquired Credit Suisse Group AG’s  ETF unit  earlier this year.
Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink has said weaker iShares
deposits in the U.S. have been offset by strength in Europe and
 Latin America .  Before Citigroup, Lord worked at Morgan Stanley for 13
years, where she was head of corporate equity derivatives in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region.
She started her career in 1987 at  Arthur Andersen  and has a
bachelor’s degree in international history and politics from the
University of Leeds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
