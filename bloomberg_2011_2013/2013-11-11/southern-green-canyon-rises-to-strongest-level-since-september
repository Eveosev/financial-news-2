Southern Green Canyon advanced to
the highest level versus West Texas Intermediate since Sept. 6
as the domestic benchmark weakened against Brent.  Gulf Coast crudes strengthened as WTI lost ground to Brent,
its discount widening by 74 cents a barrel to $11.26 at 3:19
p.m.  New York  time. Brent rose after a meeting between
representatives of  Iran  and six world powers ended without a
nuclear deal. When WTI weakens versus the international
benchmark, it can raise the value of domestic grades competing
for space in Gulf Coast refineries.  Southern Green Canyon’s discount narrowed by $1.10 to $2.65
a barrel at 1:55 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Mars Blend, a medium-sour grade, climbed by 30 cents to a
discount of $1.10 a barrel.  Poseidon gained 40 cents to a $2.20 discount, while  Thunder
Horse  advanced 25 cents to a premium of $1.50.  Light Louisiana Sweet crude increased 10 cents to a premium
of $4 a barrel relative to WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium
rose by 20 cents a barrel to $4.  West Texas Sour, a high-sulfur crude from the Permian
Basin, climbed 5 cents a barrel to a $4.45-a-barrel discount to
WTI in Cushing,  Oklahoma .  To contact the reporters on this story:
