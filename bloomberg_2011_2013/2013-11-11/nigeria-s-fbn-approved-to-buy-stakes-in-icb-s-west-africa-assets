FBN Holdings Plc, owner of First
Bank  Nigeria , said it obtained regulatory approval to acquire
stakes in International Commercial Bank Financial Group Holdings
in Ghana, Guinea, Gambia and Sierra.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  and regulators in the
respective West African countries have approved the acquisition,
the Lagos-based lender said in a statement to the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange . FBN is seeking to acquire all ICB’s West African
banking assets, according to the statement.  Lenders in Africa’s second-biggest economy are returning to
profitability after Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Lamido
Sanusi bailed out banks with 620 billion naira. Loans to equity
speculators and fuel importers in 2008 and 2009 pushed the
industry to a near collapse. The government then created the
Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria to buy lenders’ bad debts.  FBN declined 0.4 percent to 16.06 naira as of 1:58 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital. It has gained 2.4 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
