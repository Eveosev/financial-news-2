Turkey ’s  bond yields  rose to their
highest level in more than seven weeks after U.S. jobs data
boosted speculation the  Federal Reserve  will taper stimulus and
as the government in Ankara prepared for a debt sale tomorrow.  Yields on two-year bonds jumped 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, to 8.81 percent at 5 p.m. in Istanbul, the
highest level since Sept. 17 and extending their advance this
month to 100 basis points. The lira weakened 0.1 percent to
2.0392 per dollar.  Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota and
Atlanta counterpart  Dennis Lockhart  will speak tomorrow. U.S.
employers added 204,000 workers in October, compared with a
Bloomberg News survey median for a 120,000 increase, the Labor
Department said Nov. 8. The lira weakened as much as 0.8 percent
and two-year bond yields climbed 33 basis points on the same
day.  “There is still panic because of the fear that the Fed may
bring take tapering to an earlier date,” Ugur Kucuk, a fixed-income strategist at Is Securities Investment in Istanbul, wrote
in e-mailed comments today. Selling will gain traction if Fed
members imply “recovery in jobs” and gross domestic product
“growth are satisfactory,” Kucuk said referring to the
speeches by Lockhart and Kocherlakota.  The Treasury in Ankara will start this month’s scheduled
borrowing with a sale of 12-month zero-coupon bonds. It seeks to
raise 11.6 billion liras ($5.7 billion) this month, according to
the  borrowing plan  published on Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
