Alitalia  SpA Chief Executive Officer
Gabriele Del Torchio is preparing a savings plan that includes
about 2,000 job cuts as investors have until later this week to
participate in a 300 million-euro ($402 million) capital
increase, according to three people familiar with the matter.  The proposal will be discussed by the carrier’s board on
Nov. 13 in  Rome  and may include early-retirement incentives and
a reduction of temporary workers, said the people, who asked not
to be identified before a public announcement. The measures are
still being discussed and a final decision has not yet been
made, they said. An Alitalia representative declined to comment.  Alitalia SpA, which employs about 14,000 people, posted
operating losses of 162 million euros in the first nine months
as the company carries out the capital increase as part of a 500
million-euro bailout package.  Air France-KLM (AF) , the biggest
shareholder with a 25 percent stake, has said Alitalia must
reduce its debt of about 813 million euros of debt before it
would invest further in the carrier.  Alitalia was valued at 50 million euros before the capital
increase, according to the minutes of an Oct. 14 general
meeting. Investors have 30 days to decide from the that
gathering. The new stock is being offered at a 40 percent
discount to the market value, the minutes show.  Alitalia’s latest valuation means Air France has lost 96
percent of its investment in the Italian carrier since it paid
323 million euros for its stake in 2009. The French company had
bought the stake after Alitalia had gone bankrupt and was given
a fresh start by eliminating its debt, and merging its assets
with those of Air One SpA.  Italy ’s postal company Poste Italiane SpA agreed to
contribute 75 million euros for Alitalia, while the country’s
two biggest banks --  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  --
will guarantee as much as 100 million euros for eventual unopted
rights in the capital increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
