Majid Al Futtaim Holding LLC said
it’s close to buying the Spinneys supermarket chain in  Jordan 
and is no longer interested in acquiring the retailer’s other
businesses located outside the United Arab Emirates.  “It’s what makes more sense to us strategically,” Majid Al Futtaim Chief Executive Officer Iyad Malas said late
yesterday in a telephone interview. “We’re pursuing Spinneys
Jordan and not any other country.”  The company had considered acquiring Dubai-based private
equity firm Abraaj Group’s stake in the Spinneys franchise
outside the U.A.E., Malas had said in May.  Majid Al Futtaim, based in Dubai and also known by its
acronym MAF, is expanding across the Middle East, tapping the
rising disposable income of the region’s growing population. The
company in May bought Carrefour’s minority stake in Majid Al
Futtaim Hypermarkets LLC for 530 million euros ($681 million).  Spinneys was founded in  Alexandria in  1924 and acquired by
Abraaj, the region’s biggest buyout firm, in 2004. The retailer
has outlets in  Egypt , Jordan, Lebanon and Qatar and operates in
the U.A.E. under franchise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
