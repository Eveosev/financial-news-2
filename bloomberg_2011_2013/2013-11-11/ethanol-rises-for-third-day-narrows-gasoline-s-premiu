Ethanol rose for a third day,
extending the rebound from a three-year low, on estimates for
the U.S. corn crop that were below forecasts.  The biofuel’s discount to gasoline widened 1.11 cents to
89.05 cents a gallon. Ethanol gained after a Nov. 8 U.S.
Agriculture Department report estimated farmers will harvest
13.989 billion bushels of corn, the primary ingredient used to
make the additive, down from 14.029 billion expected by analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  “Some of these guys are buying now that the report is out
of the way,” said Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in
Jupiter,  Florida . “This is a pretty good time to buy if you’re
an end user. It’s sort of at near-term lows, so you’re not
hurting yourself if you take a stab at it.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 3.2 cents, or
1.9 percent, to $1.706 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have dropped 22 percent this year. Ethanol sank to $1.607
a gallon on Nov. 6, the lowest level since 2010.  Gasoline for December delivery added 4.31 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.5965 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Prices for the motor fuel climbed on speculation that
longer-than-expected seasonal U.S. refinery repairs and plant
upsets will lower supply.  Corn for December delivery jumped 8 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to $4.3475 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel of the grain makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. The December crush spread of corn
to ethanol was 13 cents, up from 12 cents Nov. 8, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Rising Output  Ethanol  production  exceeded 900,000 barrels a day for the
two weeks ended Nov. 1 for the first time in more than a year,
according to data from the Energy Information Administration.  Inventories in the week of Nov. 1 climbed 1.4 percent to
15.2 million barrels from a record low on Oct. 25, according to
the Energy Department’s statistical unit.  The U.S. tracks compliance with the biofuel consumption
standards by using Renewable Identification Numbers, or
certificates attached to each gallon of ethanol, that are
submitted to the government and also traded among refiners.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  fell 0.5 cent to 25 cents, while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, dropped 3.5 cents to 26.5 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 0.5 cent to $2.03 a
gallon in  New York , 6.5 cents to $1.825 in Chicago, 7.5 cents to
$1.935 on the  Gulf Coast  and 3 cents to $1.93 on the West Coast,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Gulf traded at a 0.5-cent premium to the West Coast
from a 4-cent deficit on Nov. 8, while Chicago’s discount to New
York Harbor narrowed 6 cents to 20.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
