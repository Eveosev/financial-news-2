Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  will form a venture
with the U.K.’s Hydrodec Group Plc to re-refine industrial oils,
capturing higher profit margins from specialty products.  The companies agreed to re-process the oils at Essar
Energy’s Stanlow refinery in northwest  England , Hydrodec said
today in a statement. They expect revenue of $150 million a year
starting in 2016 when the new units will be fully operational.  Europe ’s economic slowdown has led to overcapacity among
oil processors and narrower refining margins, or the profit from
turning a barrel of crude into products. Essar Energy, a unit of
Mumbai-based Essar Group, is among companies studying new
technologies to buoy earnings and curtail costs, and has already
switched to cheaper gas from  fuel oil  to power units at Stanlow.  The companies will invest a combined $50 million in a
facility to re-refine transformer oil and subsequently base oil,
used in lubricants, according to Hydrodec. The first unit of the
130 million-liter-a-year complex will be completed in 2014 and
fed with used oil feedstock from the U.K., the U.S. and Europe.  Hydrodec advanced as much as 3.9 percent, the most in
almost three weeks, and was up 2.9 percent at 13.25 pence as of
1:13 p.m. in London trading. Essar Energy dropped 1 percent to
112.6 pence, paring an earlier 5.4 percent decline.  The re-refining project combines Hydrodec’s proprietary
technology with Stanlow’s “considerable operational and project
execution expertise,” Volker Schultz, chief executive officer
for Essar Oil U.K., said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
