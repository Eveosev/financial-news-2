India ’s rupee dropped to an eight-week low as U.S. jobs data bolstered the case for the  Federal
Reserve  to trim stimulus.  Government bonds  advanced.  U.S. payrolls rose 204,000 in October, almost twice as much
as economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted, official data
showed Nov. 8. India’s currency was also pressured after the
central bank cut direct dollar supplies to oil refiners and
before a report tomorrow forecast to show consumer-price
 inflation  accelerated last month.  “Indian assets are clearly under pressure with the taper
theme reemerging,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency
strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in Singapore. “The spot
rupee might weaken further as the  Reserve Bank  of India scales
back some of its support measures.”  The rupee fell 1.2 percent to 63.2375 per dollar in Mumbai,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 63.4450 earlier, the weakest level since Sept. 18. The
currency may drop beyond 64 in the coming days, Cavenagh
predicts.  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 fell four
basis points to 8.95 percent, according to prices from the
central bank’s trading system. The rate had earlier risen as
high as 9.14 percent, the highest for a 10-year bond since Aug.
19.  Inflation Concerns  Consumer prices rose 9.9 percent in October from a year
earlier, compared with 9.84 percent in September, according to
the median of 32 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Industrial production probably advanced 3.5 percent in
September, after a 0.6 percent gain the previous month, a
separate Bloomberg  survey  shows.  Refiners are now buying about 30 percent to 40 percent of
their dollar requirements from the market after the RBI cut
direct supplies, Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram told
CNBC TV-18 on Nov. 7. The central bank had started a swap
facility to provide the greenback to the three largest state-run
refiners after the rupee plunged to a record-low 68.845 per
dollar on Aug. 28.  Fed policy makers will pare the monthly pace of bond-buying
to $70 billion at their March 18-19 meeting, according to the
median estimate of 32 economists in a Bloomberg News survey Nov.
8. An Oct. 17-18 survey of 40 economists also forecast a
reduction to $70 billion in March.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
38 basis points, or 0.38 percentage point, to 13.12 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards dropped 1.2 percent to
64.85 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts declined 0.3 percent to 65.19. Forwards
are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date.
Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  Investors should consider buying the rupee when the one-month NDF drops to around 64.5 per dollar, Westpac’s Cavenagh
said, adding that  India’s economy  is improving after growth
slowed to a decade low in the year ended March 31.  India’s exports rose for a fourth month in October and
imports fell, official data showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
