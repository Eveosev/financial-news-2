Boeing Co. (BA) , the world’s largest
planemaker, is working with RER Hydro Ltd. to install underwater
turbines in the St. Lawrence River near  Montreal  with capacity
to produce about 9 megawatts of electricity.  The companies plan to deploy 40 so-called hydrokinetic
turbines that RER Hydro will build in Quebec, according to a
statement today on Chicago-based Boeing’s  website .  RER Hydro, based in Montreal, developed the  technology  and
Boeing has exclusive rights to market it worldwide. This is the
first commercial order for the systems, which the plane company
said can produce power from rivers without requiring dams or
other disruptions to marine life.  “One of the things Boeing hopes to do with this technology
is to bring it to other countries, and also to provide the
necessary engineering, supplies and management,” Robert
Sterling, a Boeing spokesman, said in a telephone interview
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
