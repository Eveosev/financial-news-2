President  Barack Obama  honored U.S.
service members at a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National
Cemetery this morning, urging the nation to increase their
support for veterans of the country’s most recent wars.  Obama highlighted the service of the “9/11 generation,”
saying that after their many tours of duty a decade of war in
 Afghanistan  was finally ending.  “Even though this time of war is coming to a close, our
time of service to our newest veterans has only just begun,” he
told an audience of veterans and their families. “Even as we
make difficult fiscal choices as a nation we are going to keep
providing support for our veterans.”  Obama also laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. He
was joined by first lady  Michelle Obama , Vice President  Joe Biden  and his wife, Jill.  Earlier this morning, the president hosted a breakfast at
the White House honoring veterans and their families.  In his weekend radio address, Obama said Veterans Day is a
chance for the country to “say two simple words: thank you.”
The president said since he took office the federal government
has hired about 300,000 veterans. He also credited his policies
with establishing a transition program to aid veterans in
finding jobs, helping veterans earn college degrees, and
protecting them from predatory lending practices.  Businesses have also worked with Michelle Obama and  Jill
Biden  to help 290,000 veterans and military spouses get trained
or hired, and are committed to hiring an additional 400,000,
Obama said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
