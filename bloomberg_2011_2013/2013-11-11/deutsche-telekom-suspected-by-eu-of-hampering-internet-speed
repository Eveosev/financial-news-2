European Union antitrust regulators
are examining whether  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Orange SA (ORA)  and
 Telefonica SA (TEF)  slowed Internet connection speed to the detriment
of competitors that require high volumes of data.  Former monopolies still control large parts of the Internet
infrastructure in the three companies’ home countries, carrying
Web traffic and leasing their networks to other providers.  EU officials raided Deutsche Telekom, Orange and Telefonica
in July “to make sure that these companies were not abusing a
dominant position by degrading the quality or limiting the speed
of third-party content, for example to favor their own
content,” Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said today
at a conference in London.  The raids followed complaints to local regulators by Cogent
Communications Group Inc., a Washington-based Internet provider
whose customers send traffic across carriers’ networks. European
telecommunications companies don’t allow enough downloading
capacity to meet end-users’ demand, and connections aren’t large
or streamlined enough to allow clients like Cogent to offer
adequate service to their own customers, Chief Executive Officer
David Schaeffer said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
