Brazil ’s real halted a two-day
decline after the central bank announced that it will hold
auctions tomorrow to begin rolling over $10 billion of foreign-exchange swaps due on Dec. 2 to support the currency.  The real was unchanged at 2.3133 per U.S. dollar at 11:06
a.m. in Sao Paulo after falling 0.3 percent on Nov. 8.  “The central bank ended up pushing up the decision to roll
over swaps to give the market a bit more comfort,” Jose Carlos Amado, a currency trader at Renascenca Dtvm, said in a telephone
interview from Sao Paulo.  The currency has dropped 3.2 percent since Brazil announced
Oct. 31 the biggest  budget deficit  in almost four years, the
worst performance among major Latin American currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
