Dubai’s benchmark stock index
dropped the most in more than two months, led by developer  Emaar
Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , on bets gains this year are overdone.  The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  slid 2.8 percent, the most since
Sept. 4, to 2,822.71 at the close, trimming gains for the year
to 74 percent. Volumes surged, as shares valued at about 890
million dirhams ($242 million) traded, compared with a six-month
average of 773 million dirhams. Emaar, the developer of the
world’s tallest skyscraper, fell the most since Sept. 3, while
 Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the emirate’s biggest Shariah-compliant
lender, lost 2.7 percent before reporting results.  Dubai’s benchmark index is among the five best performing
gauges tracked by Bloomberg globally this year as the emirate’s
real-estate industry rebounds from a more than 60 percent
decline. Shares have also gained amid bets the emirate will win
a bid this month to host the World Expo in 2020. Dubai’s measure
trades at an estimated price-to-earnings multiple of 15 compared
with 12 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  index.  “The market is taking a breath,” Sebastien Henin, an Abu
Dhabi-based portfolio manager at The National Investor, said in
an e-mail. “Dubai is a very volatile market and I guess the
closer we get to the announcement of Dubai 2020 the volatility
will increase.”  Emaar fell 3.4 percent to 5.89 dirhams. Dubai Islamic Bank
lost the most since Sept. 4 to 4.03 dirhams. Third-quarter
profit surged 67 percent to 499.8 million dirhams, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on nine-month figures released
after markets closed.  Dubai’s economy, the second-biggest among the seven
sheikhdoms that make up the  United Arab Emirates , is set to
expand an average 4.6 percent a year between 2012 and 2015, more
than twice the rate of the previous four years, according to
government forecasts. Annual economic growth will be boosted by
about 0.5 percentage points in the run-up to the Expo and by
about 2 percentage points during the event should Dubai be
selected, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Sept. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
