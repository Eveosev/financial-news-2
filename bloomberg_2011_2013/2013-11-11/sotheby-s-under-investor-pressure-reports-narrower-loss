Sotheby’s (BID)  third-quarter loss
narrowed as private-sale commissions rose.  The New York company lost $30.1 million, or 44 cents a
share, compared with a loss of $32.6 million, or 48 cents a
share, a year earlier, it said in a statement.  Five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a loss of 47
cents a share.  The auctioneer saw rising pressure from investors, with
Daniel Loeb goading management to increase shareholder value.  Quarterly revenue was up 58 percent to $107.9 million, as
private sale commissions rose 77 percent. The auction house
typically posts a small loss or profit in the first and third
quarters. The biggest sales are held in the second and fourth
quarters. Its marquee New York contemporary-art sale is
scheduled for Wednesday night.  Sotheby’s  shares  are up 52 percent this year, more than
double the gain of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The shares
are up more than 20 percent since July 30, when Marcato Capital
Management reported a 6.7 percent stake and said it may seek
talks with management.  William Ruprecht, Sotheby’s chairman, chief executive
officer and president, said that private sales “contributed
more than a third of auction and related revenues in the third
quarter -- a significant shift from just a short time ago.”  Loeb, whose Third Point LLC reported a 9.3 percent stake,
has said he will seek a board seat. He called on Ruprecht to
resign.  Loeb has criticized Sotheby’s international operations and
competitive position relative to Christie’s International Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
