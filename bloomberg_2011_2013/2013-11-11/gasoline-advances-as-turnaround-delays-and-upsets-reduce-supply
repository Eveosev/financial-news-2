Gasoline advanced on reports of
planned U.S. refinery repairs taking longer than expected and
unit upsets.  Prices rose as Phillip 66’s 238,000-barrel-a-day Bayway
 refinery  in New Jersey is weeks behind schedule on fall
maintenance, a person familiar with operations said Nov. 8.
Bayway is the closest plant to  New York  Harbor, the delivery
point for gasoline futures contracts. Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s
Lemont,  Illinois , refinery is at reduced rates after a fire on
Oct. 23 in the crude unit.  “Gasoline is being supported by issues like the delay in
the turnaround at Bayway,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for December delivery advanced 3.54 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.5888 a gallon at 10:33 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume on all contracts was 0.7
percent lower than the 100-day average.  Stockpiles declined 3.76 million barrels in the week ended
Nov. 1 to 210 million, according to the Energy Information
Administration. The inventory withdrawal came as refiners
reduced operating rates and as  demand  jumped to the highest
level since July.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 82 cents to
$13.46 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  versus Brent increased 20
cents to $2.32 a barrel.  U.S.  pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to
$3.186 a gallon, the lowest level since Feb. 21, 2011, Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA said today on its website. Prices are 25.3
cents below a year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for December delivery rose 2.57
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.8976 a gallon on trading volume
that was 5.7 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  over WTI rose 45 cents to $26.47 a barrel.
The  spread  versus Brent narrowed 15 cents to $15.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
