Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  hired Marcelo Saad,
the former head of alternative investments and fixed-income
funds at Credit Suisse Hedging-Griffo, to help expand the German
firm’s  Brazil  business, two people with direct knowledge of the
matter said.  Saad’s title and range of responsibilities haven’t yet been
finalized, according to one of the people, who asked not to be
identified because the hiring hasn’t been announced.  Deutsche Bank, Europe’s largest investment bank by revenue,
said in December it would eliminate employees in its Brazilian
investment-banking and research units as part of an effort to
save 4.5 billion euros ($6 billion) by 2015. The firm, which at
the time had about 500 employees in Brazil including workers
from outsourcing services, didn’t say how many jobs were cut.  Nuno Correia, Deutsche Bank’s co-head of Global Markets
Brazil, left the company in January and wasn’t replaced.  Saad declined to comment. An official at Credit Suisse
Hedging-Griffo, the Brazil asset-management unit of Zurich-based
 Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , said Saad left his job as head of
alternative investments in April, though he was still a member
of the credit committee he helped create.  A Deutsche Bank official declined to comment on Saad, and
asked not to be identified in keeping with company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
