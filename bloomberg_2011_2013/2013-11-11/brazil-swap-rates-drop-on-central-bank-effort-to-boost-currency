Brazil ’s swap rates declined as the
effort to support the real added to speculation that the central
bank will limit increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates on contracts maturing in January 2015 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.93 percent at 1:02
p.m. in  Sao Paulo . The real declined 0.3 percent to 2.3203 per
 U.S. dollar .  Brazil’s central bank said in a Nov. 8 statement that it
will begin rollover auctions tomorrow on $10 billion of currency
swaps due Dec. 2. Policy makers are scheduling the offering
three weeks before maturity, which is twice the time that was
given between rollovers and the Nov. 1 maturity.  As the central bank supports the currency and “inflation
expectations are more controlled, people are realizing the swap
rates curve probably priced in too many hikes last week,”  David Beker , an economist at Banco Merrill Lynch SA in Sao Paulo, said
in a telephone interview.  The real has fallen 3.3 percent since Oct. 31, when the
government reported that the  budget deficit  was the largest in
almost four years. The drop in the currency is the biggest among
major Latin American dollar counterparts.  The central bank has raised the target lending rate to 9.50
percent from a record low 7.25 percent this year, the most among
49 nations tracked by Bloomberg, to cool consumer demand and
hold down prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
