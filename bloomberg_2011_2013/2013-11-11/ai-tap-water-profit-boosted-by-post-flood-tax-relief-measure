Thai Tap Water Supply PCL (TTW) ,
 Thailand ’s largest non-state producer of drinking water, said
third-quarter profit climbed 32 percent on higher tap-water
sales and as the company benefitted from a tax-relief measure.  Net income increased to 824.8 million baht ($26.1 million)
from the year-earlier period after Thai Tap was able to cut its
corporate income tax by 118.2 million baht when tax-relief
measures were granted to companies affected by Thailand’s
flooding in 2011, Thai Tap said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
