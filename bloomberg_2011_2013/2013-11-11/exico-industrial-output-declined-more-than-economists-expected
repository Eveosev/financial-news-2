Mexico’s  industrial output 
contracted in September more than analysts expected after
exports stagnated and a pair of hurricanes devastated both of
the nation’s coasts.  Production fell 1.6 percent from a year ago, more than
forecast by all 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, who predicted
a 0.4 percent decline. Output decreased 1.2 percent from the
previous month. Manufacturing production rose 1.2 percent from a
year earlier, less than the 1.3 percent forecast in the survey.  Mexico’s economic growth is slowing to a third of the pace
of last year’s 3.9 percent and to its lowest since a 2009
recession. Policy makers have cut the  benchmark interest rate 
three times this year to a record 3.5 percent. The central bank
lowered its 2013 growth estimate to between 0.9 percent and 1.4
percent on Nov. 6 from 2 percent to 3 percent, saying downside
risks to growth remain elevated.  Exports grew 2.25 percent in the year through September
compared with an increase of 6.15 percent during the same period
last year. Economic headwinds increased in September when two
hurricanes battered  Mexico ’s Pacific and Gulf coasts, killing
more than 150 people and destroying crops, roads and bridges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
