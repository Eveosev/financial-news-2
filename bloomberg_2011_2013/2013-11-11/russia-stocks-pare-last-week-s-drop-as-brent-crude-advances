Russian stocks  rose, paring last
week’s decline, as Brent crude advanced, boosting appetite for
equities in the world’s biggest energy exporter.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added less than 0.1 percent to 1,490.72 by
2:26 p.m. in Moscow, after dropping 1.7 percent last week. Of 50
stocks, 22 declined and 28 rose. OAO Moscow Exchange, the
nation’s main bourse, jumped 2.2 percent to 62.86 rubles after
being added to the MSCI Inc.’s Russia Index last week, effective
Nov. 27. VTB Group, the nation’s second-biggest lender,
increased 0.7 percent to 4.57 kopeks.  Brent climbed 0.7 percent to $105.82 in  London , while West
Texas Intermediate crude oil traded 0.3 percent lower at $94.36
in New York. Russia receives about half of its budget revenue
from oil and natural gas sales. The Micex fell in the previous
five trading sessions as  Russia  cut its average annual economic
growth forecast to 2.5 percent through 2030 and the nation’s
central bank left its main lending rates unchanged for a 14th
month.  “This week climbing oil is offering support to the
market,” Stanislav Kopylov, who helps manage about $3 billion
at UralSib Asset Management in Moscow, said by phone. “Last
week, there were concerns in the market that oil would
decline.”  Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation for
Russia to a “modest” overweight from a “big” overweight on
concern the price of Brent crude will drop, according to an e-mailed note dated Nov. 6.  American payrolls added almost twice as many workers as
projected in October, data showed on Nov. 8, damping optimism
for continued Federal Reserve stimulus.  “Fed tapering is the main fear in the market right now,”
Mansur Mammadov, a money manager at Kazimir Partners, which
oversees $300 million in assets, said by phone from Moscow.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  added 0.2 percent to 1,437.75. Russian
equities have the cheapest  valuations  among 21 emerging
economies monitored by Bloomberg, with shares on the Micex
trading at 4.2 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with
a multiple of 10.4 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
