The pound weakened for a second day
against the euro and dollar before the Bank of England publishes
new forecasts in its quarterly Inflation Report this week.  The U.K. currency declined versus most of its 16 major
counterparts. Governor  Mark Carney  will present the new economic
projections at his second Inflation Report on Wednesday with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. among those forecasting the central
bank will improve its outlook. U.K. government bonds fell,
increasing the extra yield investors demand to hold the nation’s
10-year gilts instead of German bunds to the widest since 2005.  “The pound has come off a little bit,” said  Paul Robson ,
foreign-exchange strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
in  London . “People may be wondering if a more positive
Inflation Report is now fully priced and they may have come in
to this week with a more cautious outlook.”  The pound declined 0.5 percent to 83.90 pence per euro at
3:54 p.m. London time after appreciating 1.5 percent last week,
the most since the period ended April 26. Sterling dropped 0.2
percent to $1.5982 after gaining 0.6 percent last week.  The  Bank of England ’s Monetary Policy Committee left its
asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds on Nov. 7, as
predicted by all 46 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.
Officials also kept the benchmark  interest rate  at 0.5 percent.
The central bank has said it will keep borrowing costs at a
record low until  unemployment , currently at 7.7 percent, falls
below 7 percent.  ‘Well Supported’  In the previous Inflation Report in August, officials said
unemployment was unlikely to decline to the 7 percent threshold
for considering  interest-rate  increases until late 2016. Since
then, the recovery has strengthened with services, construction
and industrial production data all beating economists forecasts.  “Sterling should remain relatively well supported,” said
 Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce in London. “The projections and the press
briefing from the BOE will be very important. The stronger
growth outlook should keep sterling supported.”  Investors should buy the pound against the euro, Australian
dollar or yen, Stretch said. Sterling will end the year at 83
pence per euro, he predicted.  The pound has strengthened 3.6 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 0.7 percent and the dollar rose 0.2 percent.  Gilts Decline  The 10-year gilt yield climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.80 percent. The 2.25 percent bond due in
September 2023 fell 0.295, or 2.95 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 95.285. The yield jumped 12 basis points  last week .  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity German bunds expanded four basis
points to 1.06 percentage points. That’s the widest since 2005,
according to closing-price data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors should sell 10-year gilts while buying  Germany ’s
2 percent security due August 2023, betting the yield difference
will widen to 1.4 percentage points, Jamie Searle, a strategist
at Citigroup Inc. in London, wrote today in a note to clients.  Gilts lost 3.4 percent this year through Nov. 8, according
to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped 1.4
percent and U.S. Treasuries declined 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
