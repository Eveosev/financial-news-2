China ’s 10-year bonds declined,
pushing the yield to a five-year high, as economic data that
topped estimates reduced demand for the relative safety of
government debt.  Industrial production gained 10.3 percent in October from a
year earlier, more than the 10 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey, a report released over the weekend showed. The
central bank will continue stabilizing expectations for
inflation, currently at an eight-month high, as the foundation
for stable consumer prices isn’t solid, it said in its third-quarter monetary-policy report last week.  “Government bonds are suffering from a double whammy of
better-than-expected data and expectations of tightening
liquidity,” said Huang Hai, Beijing-based deputy head of the
research department at SDIC CGOG Futures Co., a unit of State
Development & Investment Corp. “More than 100 billion  yuan 
($16.4 billion) of sovereign and financial bonds will be sold
this week, further damping demand for government bonds.”  The yield on the 4.08 percent government notes due August
2023 rose seven basis points to 4.4 percent as of 10:03 a.m. in
Shanghai, according to data from the Interbank Funding Center.
That was the highest for a  benchmark  10-year sovereign security
since August 2008. The yield climbed 16 basis points last week,
the biggest advance since November 2010.  Consumer prices climbed 3.2 percent in October, the most
since February, official data show. Exports increased 5.6
percent in October from a year earlier, more than the 1.7
percent gain forecast in a Bloomberg survey, according to
figures released Nov. 8.  Rate Swaps  The People’s Bank of China drained a net 5 billion yuan
from the financial system last week, after adding 29.1 billion
yuan in the five days ended Nov. 1, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg. The central bank asked lenders today to submit
orders for 91-day bills, 28-day repurchase agreements as well as
seven- and 14-day reverse repos, according to a trader at a
primary dealer required to bid at the auctions.  The cost of one-year  interest-rate swaps , the fixed payment
needed to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, rose three
basis points to 4.38 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate climbed 21 basis points last week, the
largest gain since June.  The  seven-day repo rate  fell 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, to 3.77 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. The
overnight repo rate dropped 18 basis points to 3.59 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
