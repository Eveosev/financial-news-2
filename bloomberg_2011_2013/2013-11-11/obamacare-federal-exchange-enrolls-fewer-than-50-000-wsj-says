Fewer than 50,000 people enrolled
last month in the U.S. health-insurance exchange run by the
federal government, the Wall Street Journal  reported , citing
unnamed sources.  Insurance companies have received enrollment data for
40,000 to 50,000 people since the Oct. 1 debut of the federal
exchange serving 36 states, the newspaper reported, citing two
sources that it didn’t identify. The figures would fall short of
Obama administration goals for the exchanges created as part of
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.  Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, said she couldn’t confirm the
reported numbers. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of the
department, has said the department this week will release an
official report on first-month enrollment.  An additional 49,100 people have enrolled in Obamacare
plans on 12 state-run insurance exchanges through Nov. 10,
according to a separate report today from Washington-based
consulting company Avalere Health. The data don’t include
 California , the most populous U.S. state, Massachusetts or
 Oregon .  To contact the reporter on this story:
