Water UK, which represents Britain’s
public and private water and wastewater suppliers, says a report
will be released “imminently” that concludes the risks from
shale gas drilling can be mitigated.  “There are risks but they can all be mitigated” through
monitoring and regulation, Neil Dhot, a spokesman in  London ,
said today by telephone. The report, compiled by an independent
consultant, is funded by the water industry, he said.  Protesters halted drilling this summer at a site in
southern  England  over concerns about increased traffic, noise
and contamination of a nearby aquifer from fracking, which
blasts a mix of water, sand and unspecified chemicals at high
pressure to force natural gas from subsoil shale rock.  The U.K. government has encouraged the drilling despite
fears of water contamination and earth tremors in a quest for
new, cheaper sources of energy amid declining reserves from the
 North Sea .  To contact the reporter on this story:
