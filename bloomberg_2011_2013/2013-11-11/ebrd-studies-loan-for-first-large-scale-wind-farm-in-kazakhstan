The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development is studying offering as much as 54 million euros
($72 million) of lending for Kazakhstan’s first large wind farm.  The EBRD, based in  London , may fund building, commissioning
and the operation of the 50-megawatt Yereymentau venture, the
bank said today in an e-mailed statement.  The project supports government efforts to develop cleaner
sources of energy as it strives to curb use of coal to generate
power. Kazakhstan plans to add 1,040 megawatts of green energy
by the decade’s end, Deputy Prime Minister Aset Isekeshev said
in February. In July, it published an amendment to a 2009 law
setting above-market rates for power generated by renewables.  The 90 million-euro wind project is owned by Samruk Green
Energy LLP, the renewables unit of Samruk-Energo JSC.  Samruk-Energo, set up in 2007, is owned by National Welfare
Fund Samruk-Kazyna JSC, the EBRD says. The wind farm may get an
additional loan of as much as 18 million euros from the Clean
Technology Fund, under  Climate Investment Funds , if approved.  The project will also provide credits for a carbon trading
market being created in  Kazakhstan , according to the EBRD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
