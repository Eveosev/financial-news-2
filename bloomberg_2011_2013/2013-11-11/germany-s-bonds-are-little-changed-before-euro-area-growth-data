European  government bonds  rose, with
German 10-year yields snapping their biggest gain in two months,
before a report this week that economists said will show euro-area growth slowed in the third quarter.  The  yield difference  between German five-year notes and 30-year bonds was within two basis points of the widest in more
than 16 years after the  European Central Bank  unexpectedly cut
its key interest rate to a record last week. Spanish and Italian
bonds also rose. Portuguese bonds rallied after Moody’s
Investors Service revised the nation’s bond-rating outlook to
stable from negative. The U.S. Treasury market is closed for
Veterans’ Day.  “The economy is in the early stages of a soft recovery in
the  euro zone , so we believe the ECB should have the current
interest-rate level for a long time,” said Ralf Umlauf, head of
floor research at Helaba Hessen-Thueringen in Frankfurt. “In
the short term, current yield levels should be realistic” and
be maintained until year-end, he said.  Germany ’s 10-year yield was little changed at 1.75 percent
at 4:25 p.m.  London  time after rising seven basis points on Nov.
8, the most since Sept. 5. The 2 percent bond due August 2023
climbed 0.025, or 25 euro cents per $1,000-euro ($1,340) face
amount, to 102.18.  ‘Extended Period’  The ECB lowered its main refinancing rate to 0.25 percent
after a report on Oct. 31 showed annual inflation in the euro
area slowed to 0.7 percent, the least since November 2009.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  pledged to keep borrowing costs
low for an “extended period” and said weakening price
pressures justified the ECB’s decision to cut  interest rates .  The yield difference between German five- and 30-year
securities was little changed today at 200 basis points. The
spread closed at 201 basis points on Nov. 7, the highest since
1997, based on closing prices.  The prospects of easier policy from the ECB is supporting
shorter-dated securities while those with longer maturities are
reflecting an increase in yields globally as the U.S. Federal
Reserve considers slowing stimulus, said  Marc Ostwald , a rates
strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in London.  “The problematic for the long end is the relationship to
other markets,” Ostwald said. “The front end is the bit that
has performed in the last three months and the long end is under
a bit of upward drag from upwardly moving yields in the U.S.”  Fed Purchases  Treasury 30-year yields fell to a 2013 low of 2.81 percent
on May 1 and have since jumped more than a percentage point to
3.84 percent amid bets the Fed is moving closer to cutting bond
purchases. The U.K.  30-year yield  has risen about 70 basis
points from its low for this year, reached in April.  U.S. yields extended their gains after the Fed said at its
Oct. 29-30 meeting the economy showed signs of “underlying
strength.” Analysts predict the Fed will maintain its $85
billion of monthly bond buying at the current pace until March,
according to a Bloomberg survey conducted Oct. 17-18.  Euro-area  gross domestic product  rose 0.1 percent in the
third quarter from 0.3 percent in the previous three months,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before the data is released
on Nov. 14.  Spanish 10-year yields dropped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 4.10 percent. The rate on similar-maturity
Italian bonds also fell one basis point, to 4.13 percent.  Moody’s raised its outlook on Portugal’s Ba3 rating on Nov.
8. The general government debt ratio will start to decline from
an elevated level of close to 129 percent of gross domestic
product from 2014 onward, according to a Moody’s statement.  The Portuguese 10-year yield fell 13 basis points to 5.82
percent after declining to 5.79 percent Nov. 8, the lowest level
since June 6.  German securities lost 1.4 percent this year through Nov.
8, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.  Spain ’s returned
11 percent and  Italy ’s earned 6.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
