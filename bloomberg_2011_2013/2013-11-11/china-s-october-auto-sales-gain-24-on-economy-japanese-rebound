China ’s passenger-vehicle sales last
month climbed the most since January, helped by a recovery in
economic growth and rebound in demand for Japanese brands.  Wholesale deliveries of cars, multipurpose and sport
utility vehicles rose 24 percent to 1.61 million units in
October, according to the state-backed China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers today. That compares with the median
estimate of 1.5 million units by three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  The fastest pace of auto sales in nine months adds to signs
that China’s economy is gaining momentum going into the final
quarter, with official statistics released last week showing
industrial production and customs data rose more than forecast
while manufacturing investment strengthened. Vehicle demand for
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  surged last month as
anti-Japanese sentiment over a territorial dispute abated.  “The recovery of demand for Japanese-brand cars is
spurring overall vehicle sales,” said Harry Chen, an analyst
with Guotai Junan Securities Co. in Shenzhen. “It’ll take the
Japanese automakers more time to gain back market share.”  Total sales of vehicles, including buses and trucks, rose
20 percent to 1.93 million units last month, the association
said. In the first 10 months of the year, 17.8 million vehicles
were delivered, with 14.5 million being automobiles.  Commercial vehicles sales increased 7.4 percent in the
first 10 months of the year to 3.36 million units.  Economic Growth  China’s industrial output growth unexpectedly accelerated
and inflation stayed below a government target last month,
adding to a picture of an economy that is gaining strength.
Production rose 10.3 percent from a year earlier, while
inflation was 3.2 percent and producer prices fell 1.5 percent,
the National Bureau of Statistics said Nov. 9.  Sales of SUVs jumped 73 percent to 284,200 units last
month, while deliveries of multipurpose vehicles more than
tripled to 135,300 units. Sedan deliveries gained 17 percent to
1.06 million vehicles.  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Focus was the best-selling sedan last
month, with Great Wall Motor Co.’s Haval line remaining the
nation’s top-selling SUV.  Toyota’s sales in the country rose 81 percent to 82,400
units, while Honda more than tripled its sales to 75,150.  Nationwide demonstrations erupted in China last year over
 Japan ’s purchase of a group of disputed islands, sparking a
consumer backlash against Japanese auto brands.  General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest foreign automaker in China,
reported a 12 percent gain in October sales to 282,446 units,
led by demand for its Wuling and Buick vehicles.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
