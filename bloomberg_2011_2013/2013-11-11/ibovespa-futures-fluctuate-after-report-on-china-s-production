The Ibovespa rose for the first time
in five sessions, with developer  BR Properties SA (BRPR3)  leading gains,
amid speculation the Brazilian benchmark’s longest losing streak
in six weeks may have been excessive.  Oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  contributed the most to
the gauge’s advance as crude climbed. BR Properties SA rose the
most since July 2012 after saying it will buy back shares. Phone
company Tim Participacoes SA rebounded from a five-week low.
Power utility  Light SA (LIGT3)  rallied after posting third-quarter
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  The Ibovespa added 0.7 percent to 52,623.87 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, with 44 stocks higher and 27 lower. The
gauge had dropped 4 percent in the previous four sessions amid
concern that an increase in  Brazil ’s budget deficit would lead
to a reduction in the country’s credit rating.  “Many of the concerns about Brazil’s economic outlook are
priced into the Ibovespa already,”  Alvaro Bandeira , a partner
at Orama Asset Management, said in a telephone interview from
 Rio de Janeiro . “Earnings have been somewhat positive and in
line with what you expect from a recovering economy.”  Light advanced 0.6 percent to 20.20 reais. The Rio de
Janeiro-based utility posted adjusted net income of 321.5
million reais, more than the average estimate of 98.9 million
reais among three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Half of the 42
 companies  on the Ibovespa that have already reported third-quarter figures beat estimates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Ibovespa  earlier  dropped as much as 0.3 percent.
 Standard & Poor’s , which is evaluating Brazil’s BBB credit
rating for a 24-month period, could lower the ranking if its
fiscal position worsens, Regina Nunes, a director at the
company, said in an interview on Nov. 8.  Real Estate  Homebuilder MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA rose 3.6
percent to 8.91 reais.  BR Properties added 5.3 percent to 17.85 reais after saying
it will buy back as many as 17 million voting shares over the
next six months.  Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, added 2.3
percent to 20.09 reais. Tim gained 3.9 percent to 11.04 reais.  Brazil’s benchmark equity index entered a  bull market  Sept.
9 after rising 20 percent from this year’s  low  on July 3 through
that day. The gauge has since pared this gain to 17 percent.
Trading volume of stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 4.87 billion reais
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with a daily average of 7.61 billion reais this year through
Oct. 22, according to the latest data available from the
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
