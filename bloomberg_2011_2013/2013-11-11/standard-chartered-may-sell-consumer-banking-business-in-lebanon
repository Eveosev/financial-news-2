Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.
bank that gets more than three-quarters of its earnings in Asia,
may sell its consumer banking unit in Lebanon as the lender cuts
back on less profitable businesses.  The lender is reviewing the option of divesting its
consumer banking business in Lebanon, a bank spokesman said,
asking not to be named under company policy. The bank plans to
continue wholesale banking services after any sale, he said  Standard Chartered has operated in Lebanon since 2000 and
manages three branches and three priority banking centers,
employing about 120 people, according to its website. In April,
it appointed Dan Azzi, previously regional head of global
markets and co-head of wholesale banking for Middle East, North
Africa and  Pakistan , as chief executive officer in Lebanon.  Standard Chartered plans to focus on business and countries
that offer the most potential for profitable growth and pull
back elsewhere, CEO Peter Sands told investors on a conference
call today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
