Fox Sports and the  Big East
Conference  became partners to sell the college sports league’s
sponsorships and broadcast advertising.  Under the two-year agreement,  Fox  and the  Big East  will
sell the presenting-sponsorship rights to all conference
championships, plus a range of television and non-television
inventory, Fox said in a press release.  “We have already had many inquiries from advertisers
looking to associate with Big East properties, and this unique
arrangement will allow us to package and deliver the assets a
client values throughout all sports seasons and conference
championships,” said Larry Jones, executive vice president of
Fox Sports, a unit of  News Corp .  The conference’s biggest properties include the Big East
men’s basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden in  New York 
City, the Big East women’s basketball tournament in  Chicago  and
other conference championships including soccer, lacrosse and
track and field.  Fox is the main broadcast rightsholder of the Big East,
which is made up of 10 schools where the main sport primarily is
basketball. Football schools who were Big East members have
formed the American Athletic Conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
