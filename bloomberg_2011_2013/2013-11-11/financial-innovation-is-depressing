DealBook has  a special section  today on ideas and innovation on Wall Street and let's just say it will not inspire too many idealistic Stanford undergrads to stop work on their iPhone apps and take that financial-engineering job at Wells Fargo. It's all pretty sad stuff.  My favorite article in the section is of course the  one on innovation in fraud , which it turns out is genuinely fertile ground for creativity, though tell that to the Stanford kids. To be fair, though, there is also innovation in catching fraud, specifically a Commodity Futures Trading Commission Rule, adopted in 2011, that outlaws market manipulation. So! Nice work there CFTC. But then there is  this subtle article  about index funds. Index funds: brilliant, world-changing financial innovation, totally, no doubt, top financial innovation of 1976. 1   What have they been up to lately? Sure, maybe, but the improved-index fund is really a marketing coup more than anything else. Like, here: I think the improved index fund gets all the advantages of each category, with none of the disadvantages. 2   Active management means running screens to pick stocks, researching the ones selected by the screens, picking the best ones, investing in them, and charging a healthy fee for all that work. Passive management means buying all the stocks and charging a couple of basis points to cover your electric bill. The improved index means running screens to pick stocks, picking whatever the screens say, and then charging I'll guess an intermediate fee while saying  both  "see we're an index fund,  everybody loves index funds ,"  and  "We don't think you need to settle for average returns." 3   Magic!  Or there is  the one  on innovation in getting people to invest in private equity funds under the new, more liberal JOBS Act rules. 4  This one focuses on online databases matching private equity funds and accredited investors and actually sounds likable enough. There is some appeal to eliciting investments based on track records and data rather than random personal connections or dodgy consultants or, um, one of the database guys says, "We canâ€™t replicate the 70 people working the phones for you," which seems like a self-evidently bad way of selling private equity investments to individuals. I mean, this has to be an improvement over that. But note that here too the innovation is essentially one of marketing, not of better allocating capital. Coincidentally, today there's  a new NBER paper  finding that "Conventional interpretations of PE performance measures appear optimistic" and that private equity investors "may just break even, net of management fees, carry, risk, and costs of illiquidity." 5   Smaller investors can find private equity funds more efficiently just as bigger investors start to question the model. Finally, there is  the one  about how new leverage rules are reducing banks' return on equity and thus forcing them to innovate by firing everyone and shutting down branches, about which the less said the better. This is all sort of a bummer. There are basically three categories of financial innovation here: 6  That  is  the stereotype is it not? That the financial services industry is about finding legal ways to deceive people into paying too much for stuff they don't need, or failing that finding  illegal  ways to do that, or failing that just firing everyone and giving up.  There are good kinds of financial innovation, of course; they go something like: 7  Etc. Are there any such innovations these days? Sure, maybe, if you look hard enough. Blackstone is using rental securitizations to  lower the costs of renting houses to people . 8   Peer-to-peer lending  might  lower businesses' cost of capital. Fantex is  using tracking stock  to shift a portion of NFL players' large and undiversified career risk to gamblers who want exactly that risk. But people hate all those things. Rent securitization is 2007 all over again. Peer-to-peer financing is ripe for fraud.  Fantex is  exploitative and badly structured. One result of the financial crisis and its aftermath is that people deeply, deeply distrust financial innovation. The wounds of mortgage-backed securities -- which were supposed to lower the cost of credit and shift risk from lenders who wanted to hedge onto investors who wanted the risk -- are too fresh for those goals to sound compelling. If you say you've found a new way to lower financing costs or to shift risks in optimal ways, no one will believe you. So you might as well make pretty modest claims for pretty modest innovations -- in cost-cutting, in marketing or, of course, in simple fraud.
