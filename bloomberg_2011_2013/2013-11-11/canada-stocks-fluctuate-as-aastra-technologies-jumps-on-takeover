Canadian  stocks  fell, after the
benchmark index posted its fourth weekly gain in five, as a
slump in gold producers offset rallies in Aastra Technologies
Ltd. and CCL Industries Inc.  Detour Gold Corp. (DGC)  tumbled 7.1 percent after Canaccord
Genuity Corp. cut its recommendation.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW) , the
world’s largest buyer of precious-metal output rights from
copper, zinc and lead mines, slipped 0.7 percent after it missed
analysts’ quarterly sales forecast and cut its dividend. Aastra
Technologies rallied 14 percent after agreeing to be acquired by
Mitel Networks Corp. CCL Industries Inc. jumped 9.1 percent to a
record after sales beat estimates.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  lost 19.94
points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,358.39 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, after
rising as much as 0.1 percent earlier. Trading in the benchmark
gauge’s stocks was 6.7 percent below the 30-day average.  “Ultimately we’re going to need to see revenue growth
accelerate to keep this rally going,” said Jeff Young, chief
investment officer of NexGen Financial Corp. in Toronto, who
oversees about C$900 million ($859 million), said in a phone
interview. “It remains to be seen when that will happen.”  Gold slipped to a three-week low in New York on speculation
that signs of a strengthening U.S. economy will encourage the
Federal Reserve to curb stimulus measures, eroding the appeal of
the metal as a store of value. Futures for December delivery
lost 0.3 percent to $1,281.10 an ounce.  Industry Returns  Seven of 10 main  industries  in the S&P/TSX declined. BCE
Inc. lost 0.9 percent to C$45.94 and Rogers Communications Inc.
slipped 0.8 percent to C$46.71 to pace declines as telephone
stocks retreated 0.7 percent as a group.  Atlantic Power Corp. (ATP)  dropped 2.2 percent to C$3.96,
extending a record low, and has plunged 13 percent in two days
since reporting worse-than-projected third-quarter  earnings  on
Nov. 7.  Silver Wheaton declined 0.7 percent to C$22.46. Sales
totaled $166.4 million in the third quarter, trailing the
average analyst estimate of $185.6 million. The company reduced
its  dividend  to 9 cents a share from 10 cents in the previous
quarter.  Detour Gold plunged 7.1 percent to C$5.90, the lowest since
December 2008. The stock has lost 28 percent in the past three
trading sessions.  The producer of the precious metal was cut to hold from
speculative buy by Rahul Paul, an analyst with Canaccord
Genuity. The stock plunged 18 percent on Nov. 8 after saying it
will not meet 2013 production targets.  Aastra, CCL  Aastra (AAH)  surged 14 percent to C$32.29. The maker of
telecommunications equipment agreed to be bought by Mitel for
$6.52 in cash plus 3.6 Mitel shares for each Aastra share. Using
the closing Mitel share price on Nov. 8, 2013, and a Canadian
dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 0.9531, this amounts to
C$31.96 per Aastra common share.  CCL Industries jumped 9.1 percent to a record C$78.68. The
maker of specialty packaging posted revenue of C$606.6 million
in the third quarter,  exceeding  the average estimate of C$549.5
million from two analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  IGM Financial Inc. (IGM)  climbed 5.5 percent to C$54.22 for the
highest close since October 2007. BMO Capital Markets analyst
John Reucassel raised his rating for the stock to outperform,
the equivalent of a buy, on Nov. 8. IGM has five buys and seven
holds, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Equities rose last week as jobs data from the U.S. and
 Canada  beat economists’ forecasts, bolstering optimism the
region’s growth is accelerating. The S&P/TSX climbed 0.3 percent
for the week, extending its 2013 advance to 7.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
