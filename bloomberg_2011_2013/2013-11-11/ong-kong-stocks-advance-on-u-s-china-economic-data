Hong Kong   stocks  gained, with the
city’s benchmark index heading for its first advance in six
days, after U.S. payrolls and China’s industrial production
increased more than expected.  The  Hang Seng Index  climbed 0.1 percent to 22,760.00 as of
9:34 a.m. in Hong Kong. The gauge dropped 2.2 percent last week
amid concern the  Federal Reserve  may cut stimulus sooner than
expected. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lost 0.1 percent
to 10,377.61.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1
percent. The gauge climbed 1.3 percent on Nov. 8 in New York as
a better-than-forecast jobs report added to signs growth is
strong enough for the economy to withstand a stimulus reduction.
Tapering is to begin in March, based on a Bloomberg survey last
week, with analysts expecting monthly bond purchases to fall to
$70 billion from $85 billion.  U.S. employers added 204,000 workers after a revised
163,000 gain in September that was larger than previously
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.
The increase in payrolls topped the most optimistic forecast in
a survey of economists.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  advanced 15 percent from this year’s
low on June 24 though Nov. 8 amid signs  China’s economy  is
stabilizing. Hong Kong’s benchmark index  traded  at 10.87 times
estimated earnings, compared with 15.98 for the S&P 500
yesterday.  China Output  Industrial production  in China rose 10.3 percent last month
from a year earlier, the nation’s statistics bureau said Nov. 9,
exceeding the 10 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of economists and accelerating from 10.2 percent growth in
September. Inflation came in at 3.2 percent, below the 3.5
percent full-year government target and the 3.3 percent
projected by economists. Retail sales rose 13.3 percent from a
year earlier and producer prices fell 1.5 percent.  President  Xi Jinping  and Chinese Communist Party leaders
tomorrow conclude a four-day gathering aimed at mapping out a
blueprint for changes that include reducing the government’s
role in the economy and spurring foreign investment.  Failure to
implement reforms on issues from  interest rates  to local
government debt and land ownership risks impeding boosting
incomes and spurring hundreds of millions of rural residents to
move to the cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
