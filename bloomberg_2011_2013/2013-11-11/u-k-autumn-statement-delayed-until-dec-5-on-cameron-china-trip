Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  will delay announcing new fiscal forecasts because Prime
Minister  David Cameron  is traveling to  China .  Osborne announced last month that he would make his annual
Autumn Statement to Parliament on Dec. 4. It will now be
postponed by a day because of Cameron’s trip, the Treasury said
in an e-mailed statement.  “Tonight, the prime minister announced that he will lead a
delegation to China in early December,” the Treasury said. “As
a result the Autumn Statement will now be made by the
chancellor on Thursday, Dec. 5.”  Osborne will announce revised economic and fiscal forecasts
in the statement. He’s pledged to stick to his deficit-cutting
program even as growth accelerates. The European Commission
forecast Nov. 5 that the U.K. economy will grow 2.2 percent next
year, twice the pace of the euro area and more than Germany and
France.  Britain is seeking to foster ties with China to promote
trade with the world’s second-largest economy. Osborne went to
China, along with London Mayor  Boris Johnson , last month. The
government announced on Oct. 15 it will allow Chinese banks to
set up branches for wholesale banking in the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
