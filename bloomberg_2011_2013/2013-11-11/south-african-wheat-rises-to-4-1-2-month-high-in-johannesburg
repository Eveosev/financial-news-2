South African wheat futures rose to
the highest level in more than four months by the close in
Johannesburg. Corn climbed.  Wheat for delivery in December advanced 0.6 percent to
3,597 rand ($347) a metric ton by the midday close on the South
African Futures Exchange. That’s the highest settlement for a
most traded contract since June 21, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  South Africa, a net importer of wheat, is the sub-Saharan
region’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia  and the
area’s biggest buyer after Nigeria and  Sudan , according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture data.  Yellow corn for delivery in December increased 1.7 percent
to 2,367 rand a ton, while the white variety increased 1.3
percent to 2,452.20 rand a ton by the midday close.  South Africa is the continent’s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
