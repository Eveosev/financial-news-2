Indonesia ’s rupiah fell to a one-month low as U.S. jobs data that topped estimates fueled concern
the  Federal Reserve  will bring forward a plan to cut stimulus.
Bonds gained before Bank Indonesia reviews policy tomorrow.  Employers in the world’s largest economy added 204,000
workers in October, beating the most optimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg survey, official data showed Nov. 8. Fed policy makers
said last month they needed to see more economic improvement
before reducing monthly bond purchases. Bank Indonesia will keep
the  reference rate   unchanged  at 7.25 percent tomorrow, according
to 14 of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “There is concern that the Fed’s tapering may be brought
forward due to improving U.S. data,” said Suriyanto Chang, head
of treasury at PT Bank QNB Kesawan in Jakarta. “The rupiah’s
weakness shouldn’t be a trigger for  Bank Indonesia  to raise
rates as it would help reduce imports” as declines in the local
currency make inward shipments costlier, he said.  The rupiah slid 0.7 percent to 11,491 per dollar as of 9:23
a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks show. It reached 11,498
earlier, the weakest level since Oct. 11. In the offshore
market, one-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.2 percent to
11,485, trading 0.05 percent stronger than the onshore spot
rate, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 14.86 percent. A daily
 fixing  used to settle the forwards was set at 11,267 per dollar
on Nov. 8, according to the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  The cost to insure Indonesia’s debt against non-payment
using five-year  credit-default swaps  climbed 17 basis points to
237 on Nov. 8, the highest level since Oct. 9, according to data
provider CMA.  The yield on the nation’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
fell two basis points to 7.92 percent today, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
