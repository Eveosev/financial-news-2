Hedge funds  and other money managers
cut  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  by 16,907 contracts, or 14
percent, to the lowest in more than six months, according to
data from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 102,544 lots in
the week ended Nov. 5, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. That’s the lowest
since April 23 and is the fourth weekly decline.  Bearish positions  by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish wagers by 290,357 contracts,
a 9.7 percent decrease in their net-short position from Oct 29.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators and institutional
investors, as well as commercial companies that buy or sell
futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and investors
follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Brent futures dropped 3.4 percent to $105.33 a barrel in
the week to Nov. 5 and traded at $105.61 as of 1:04 p.m. London
time on the ICE exchange.  Swap dealers trimmed net-long positions by 4.7 percent to
218,188 contracts in the period.  Money managers’ bullish bets on  European gasoil  fell for a
second week to 54,306 lots. That’s a decline of 18 percent to
the lowest since July 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
