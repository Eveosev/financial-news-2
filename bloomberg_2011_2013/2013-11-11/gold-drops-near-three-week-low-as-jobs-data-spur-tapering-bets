Gold fell for a third day toward a
three-week low after data showed that U.S. employers added more
jobs than expected, boosting speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will begin scaling back stimulus.  Bullion for immediate delivery dropped as much as 0.4
percent to $1,283.28 an ounce, and traded at $1,287.03 at 11:57
a.m. in Singapore. Prices retreated to $1,281.18 on Nov. 8, the
lowest level since Oct. 17.  Gold slumped 23 percent in 2013 as the dollar strengthened
amid prospects for an economic recovery, while inflation
remained low. U.S. employers added 204,000 workers in October,
compared with the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey for
an increase of 120,000. The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index was
little changed today from a two-month high on Nov. 8 after the
employment data was released.  “The stronger U.S. employment data prompted gold lower on
concern the Federal Reserve will taper stimulus sooner than
markets expect,”  Lachlan Shaw , an analyst at  Commonwealth Bank
of Australia , wrote in an e-mail today.  Gold for delivery in December traded 0.1 percent higher at
$1,286.30 an ounce on the Comex in  New York  after dropping 1.8
percent on Nov. 8. Trading volume was 13 percent below the
average for the past 100 days for this time of day.  Spot silver lost as much as 1 percent to $21.3003 an ounce,
and was at $21.3857. Prices fell to $21.274 on Nov. 8, the
lowest level since Oct. 17. Platinum was little changed at
$1,443.85 an ounce, while palladium decreased 0.2 percent to
$756.63 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
