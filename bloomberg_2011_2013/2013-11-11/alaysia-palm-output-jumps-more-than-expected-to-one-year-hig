Palm oil output in  Malaysia , the
world’s second-largest producer, climbed to the highest level in
more than year in October, exceeding analysts’ expectations and
boosting stockpiles to a six-month high.  Production gained 3.1 percent to 1.97 million metric tons
from a month earlier, the highest since September 2012, the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board said today. Inventories rose 3.5
percent to 1.85 million tons, the largest since April, while
exports gained 3.3 percent to 1.66 million tons. That compares
with the median estimates of 1.87 million tons for output, 1.84
million tons for reserves and 1.6 million tons for exports in a
Bloomberg survey published last week.  Futures, heading for the first annual gain in three years,
entered a bull market this month on speculation that output from
top producers Indonesia and Malaysia may be less than analysts
expectation and the start of the monsoon season may curb supply.
Production of the tropical oil, used in everything from candy to
biofuel, is typically highest from July to October because of
growing cycles.  “October is the highest production month of the year and
we are not going to see that anymore for the rest of the year,”
said Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst with Kenanga Investment
Bank Bhd., by phone from Kuala Lumpur. “Inventory should rise
in November because we do not expect much stocking activity due
to lack of festivals in  China  and  India .”  Exports Drop  Output may drop 6.5 percent in November to 1.84 million
tons, while exports are seen falling to 1.5 million tons,
boosting reserves to 1.91 million tons, Lim said.  Shipments from Malaysia fell 13 percent to 472,321 tons in
the first 10 days of November from the same period last month,
surveyor Intertek said today.  Palm for January delivery advanced as much as 1.5 percent
to 2,546 ringgit ($794) a ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives
before the report. Prices rose to 2,628 ringgit on Nov. 1, the
highest close since September 2012 and 21 percent more than the
2,167 settlement on July 29, meeting the common definition of a
bull market.  Prices have reached 2013 cyclical bottom and gains will
last through January, Hariyanto Wijaya, an analyst at Mandiri
Sekuritas, a unit of Bank Mandiri,  Indonesia ’s biggest bank by
assets, said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
