Blackstone (BX)  Group LP is in talks to
sell a west London office development to China Investment Corp.,
the sovereign-wealth fund that holds stakes in banks and
brokerages, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  Chiswick Park, a 33-acre (13-hectare) site that includes
buildings leased to PepsiCo Inc., Tullow Oil Plc and Walt Disney
Co., would be sold for about 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion)
if the talks result in a deal, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the discussions are private. CIC didn’t
reply to an e-mail sent to its Beijing-based media office
seeking comment. Blackstone spokeswoman  Christine Anderson 
declined to comment.  Chinese investment into  Europe , including real estate
purchases, is forecast to exceed $1 trillion by 2020, New York-based economic research company Rhodium Group LLC said in a
 report  last year. Blackstone, the world’s biggest manager of
alternative assets such as property, bought Chiswick Park in
2011 for 480 million pounds and has since developed an office
building and started construction on a second.  A CIC purchase would add to a wave of recent Asian
investment in London.  Hong Kong ’s banking regulator bought 50
percent of a project in London’s luxury-shopping district for
more than 100 million pounds last week. Oxley Holdings Ltd., a
Singapore-based property developer, agreed earlier this month to
buy an east  London  site where it plans to build 3,400 homes.  The Financial Times reported the talks earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
