Hanjin Shipping Co. (117930) ’s Chief
Executive Officer Kim Young Min resigned, taking responsibility
for two successive years of losses at South Korea’s largest
shipper and a delay in getting financial support from creditors.  Kim, 58, will stay until a replacement is found, the Seoul-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. Kim was
appointed as CEO in January 2009 after 20 years with Citigroup
Inc., and his term was to end in March 2015.  Shares of the container-to-commodity mover, which last
month received a loan from affiliate  Korean Air Lines Co. (003490)  to
ease a “temporary” liquidity shortage,  fell  for a fifth
straight day in Seoul. Laden with debt, Hanjin is among liners
battling a global overcapacity and slump in cargo rates caused
by  China ’s weak iron-ore demand, factors that pushed  STX Pan
Ocean Co. (028670)  to file for a court receivership in June.  “There’s no good news for Hanjin right now,” said Yun Hee
Do, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul.
“The company hasn’t been able to make  money  recently and its
interest payment has been increasing. There’s quite a sizable
amount of debt coming due next year for Hanjin.”  Korean Air said last month it will provide 150 billion won
($141 million) to Hanjin to help ease the company’s liquidity
shortage. The shipping line has 736.4 billion won of debt and
loans maturing next year, compared with 58 billion won in 2013,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Its cash and cash
equivalent was 506.6 billion won at the end of June.  Shares Drop  Hanjin Shipping’s $150 million of convertible notes sold in
July 2011 were yielding 9.232 percent today compared with 9.184
percent at the start of the month, according to Bloomberg-compiled prices.  The stock  fell 3.2 percent to 6,870 won at the close of
trading in  Seoul  today. Hanjin has slumped 43 percent this year,
compared with a 1 percent decline in the benchmark Kospi index.
 Hyundai Merchant (011200)  dropped 7.9 percent today and STX Pan Ocean
declined 3.9 percent in Seoul.  Hanjin Shipping is considering selling new shares, loans
and perpetual bonds to raise funds to repay its debt and improve
finances, Korea Economic Daily said on Oct. 31, citing
unidentified company officials. Sonya Cho, a Hanjin Shipping
spokeswoman, said a share sale is among options being considered
by the company.  Korea Development Bank  and other lenders may provide short-term loans to the shipping company, Maeil Business Newspaper
said today, citing financial industry officials it didn’t name.
Hanjin posted a loss in each of the past 10 quarters.  Chaebol Hanjin  Korean Air , the nation’s biggest airline, is the largest
 shareholder  of Hanjin’s parent Hanjin Shipping Holdings Co. They
are both part of the Hanjin Group, which also has aerospace-related businesses.  Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., the country’s second-biggest
shipping company, collected 156 billion won in a share sale last
week. That was less than the 214.5 billion won the company
expected to raise, according to a Nov. 4 regulatory filing.  Korea Development Bank bought 224 billion won of bonds sold
by Hyundai Merchant last month to help the shipping company
refinance its maturing debt. About 462.7 billion won of debt and
loans are due next year, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  STX Restructuring  STX Pan Ocean,  South Korea ’s biggest commodities-shipping
company, went under court protection in June with a net debt of
5.37 trillion won at the end of 2012. The company has submitted
its revival plan to the court in Seoul, which included a debt-for-equity swap and a rescheduling of loans.  Spot rates to haul container cargo from  Asia  to  Europe , the
world’s busiest trading lane, have dropped 5 percent from this
year’s high, according to the Shanghai Shipping Exchange. Those
from Asia to U.S. west coast dropped 32 percent to $1,718 per
40-foot box.  The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY)  fell for three years since 2010,
touching a record low in February last year of 647 because of
slowing demand for moving  iron ore , a key ingredient in making
steel, to China. The gauge has since more than doubled to 1,581
as of Nov. 8.  Hanjin Shipping narrowed  losses  to 121.8 billion won in the
first half, from 346.6 billion won loss a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
