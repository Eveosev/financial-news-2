Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  will start selling
Infiniti cars in Japan for the first time, 24 years after the
luxury brand was born in the U.S., as it takes on high-end
models from automakers including  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz.  The first model in Japan, to be sold as Skyline, will be a
hybrid version of Infiniti’s flagship Q50 sedan, Nissan Chief
Planning Officer  Andy Palmer  said before an event yesterday to
unveil the car, which will go on sale in February. Nissan is
targeting initial monthly sales of 200 vehicles for the model,
priced from 4.5 million yen ($45,000), the company said in a
statement yesterday.  Selling Infiniti in more markets would move the Yokohama,
Japan-based carmaker closer to its goal of boosting the brand’s
annual sales to 500,000 vehicles by March 2017 and narrow the
gap with Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Mercedes-Benz. Nissan
is tapping Japanese consumers’ familiarity with the brand
Skyline, which is also the name of a range of autos it already
sells in the nation.  “Will it work to expand Nissan’s footprint, or will
Japanese buyers view this as a simple marketing ploy?” Karl Brauer, senior analyst at Kelley  Blue Book , said by e-mail.
“We’ll know soon enough, but it’s possible Nissan will merely
retain its existing customer base with little-to-no real growth
in total home market sales.”  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Japan’s largest automaker, introduced
the Lexus brand in its home market in 2005. Last year’s domestic
sales of the luxury brand fell 3 percent to 42,300 vehicles,
accounting for less than 10 percent of global deliveries,
according to Toyota. Honda Motor Co., the nation’s third-largest
carmaker, doesn’t sell its Acura luxury cars in Japan.  Emperor’s Carmaker  Nissan said it sold 173,000 Infiniti cars worldwide in
2012, compared with its goal of half a million vehicles a year
by 2017.  Prince Motor, a carmaker for the late Emperor Hirohito,
first introduced Skyline cars in Japan in  1957 . The automaker
 merged  with Nissan in 1966.  Nissan began selling the Skyline sedan as the Infiniti G
sport sedan overseas in 2002 and renamed the model Q50 at the
start of this year. The Nissan Skyline will continue to be sold
in Japan along with the hybrid Skyline, Palmer said.  “Its bloodline, its DNA, is directly from the Prince Motor
Company,” Palmer said. “There can be no better symbol of the
fact that Skyline is linked to the premium and luxury brand.”  Palmer declined to say whether Nissan plans to sell the
gasoline-run Infiniti Q50 in Japan or sell other models under
the luxury brand at home in the future.  Nissan rose 1.1 percent to 907 yen as of 12:52 p.m. in
Tokyo trading, while  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
gained 1.9 percent. The carmaker’s shares have climbed 12
percent this year.  The new Skyline is priced similarly to BMW’s 3-series,
which starts at about 4.5 million yen in Japan, and the
Mercedes-Benz C-class, costing 4 million yen or more, according
to the companies’ websites.  To contact the reporters on this story:
