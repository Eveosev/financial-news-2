Mitel Networks Corp. (MITL)  and  Aastra
Technologies Ltd. (AAH)  agreed to merge, creating a combined company
with a global customer base of 60 million end users.  Under the terms of the “definitive arrangement,” agreed
by the boards of both companies, Mitel will acquire all Aastra’s
outstanding stock for $6.52 in cash plus 3.6 Mitel shares for
each Aastra share, the companies said today in a joint
statement. Using the closing Mitel share price on Nov. 8, 2013,
and a Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 0.9531,
this amounts to C$31.96 per Aastra common share.  “The business communications market is ripe for
consolidation and on the cusp of a mass migration to cloud-based
services,” Mitel Chief Executive Officer Richard McBee said in
the statement. “Small competitors with narrow focus and limited
global reach will quickly be marginalized.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
