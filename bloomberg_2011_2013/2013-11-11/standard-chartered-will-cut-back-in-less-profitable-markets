Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.
bank that makes three-quarters of its earnings in Asia, is to
review its businesses to cut back or withdraw from less-profitable markets.  “We are sharpening our focus,” Chief Executive Officer
 Peter Sands , 51, told analysts and investors in a presentation
in London today. “There are pieces of our portfolio, whether
very small geographies, or businesses that lack strategic
synergies with other parts of the bank, that we are evaluating
very carefully.”  The lender, based in London, doesn’t expect to hit its
target to grow revenue by at least 10 percent for the next
“couple of years,” Sands said. The bank had already said it
wasn’t likely to meet the goal this year after writing down the
value of its Korean business by $1 billion in the first half.  Standard Chartered  left consumer banking in Japan last year
and is selling a similar business in Lebanon, Sands said.  The lender would follow Asia-focused  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  in
selling businesses that are unprofitable or don’t provide
opportunities for other units. HSBC CEO  Stuart Gulliver  plans to
cut an additional $3 billion of expenses after beating an
earlier target. He has closed or sold 60 businesses and
eliminated 46,000 jobs since the start of 2011.  Standard Chartered in August posted a 24 percent drop in
first-half profit to $2.18 billion. It said at the time that
Korea’s personal debt rehabilitation program had spurred a jump
in loan impairments. The bank remains committed to the market,
he said.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Simone Meier  To contact the reporter on this story:
