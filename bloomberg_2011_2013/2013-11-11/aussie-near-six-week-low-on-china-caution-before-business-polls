Australia ’s dollar fell to a six-week low and bonds dropped as traders weighed prospects for
growth in  China , the South Pacific nation’s biggest trading
partner, before a four-day Communist Party summit ends today.  The currency also declined after a report from National
Australia Bank Ltd. showed business confidence fell by the most
since 2011. Australia’s 10-year government bond  yields  climbed
to the highest in more than 1 1/2 years. New Zealand’s dollar
touched the lowest level this month.  “The market has taken on board that things are improving
perhaps not only not as fast as people thought, but not at
all,” Ray Attrill, the Sydney-based global co-head of currency
strategy at NAB. “The sentiment at the moment is a little bit
bearish on the Aussie, which essentially means that news that
can be seen as negative is likely to resonate.”  Australia’s dollar lost 0.3 percent to 93.36 U.S. cents as
of 5:09 p.m. in Sydney after touching 93.25, the weakest since
Oct. 1. It has tumbled 2 percent over the past four days.  New
Zealand ’s currency dropped 0.2 percent to 82.33 U.S. cents after
reaching 82.06, the lowest since Oct. 30.  Benchmark 10-year bond yields in Australia rose seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.29 percent, the highest
since March 2012.  Sentiment Slides  A  sentiment gauge  among Australian businesses fell to 5 in
October from 12 the prior month, NAB said today. A measure of
business conditions was unchanged at minus 4. NAB separately
pushed back its forecast for a  Reserve Bank  of Australia rate
cut to May from February, citing a slower increase in
unemployment.  Traders see a 16 percent chance that the RBA will cut its
benchmark  interest rate  from a record-low 2.5 percent by
February, compared with 22 percent odds at the start of this
month, according to  interest-rate swaps  data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In China, President  Xi Jinping  and hundreds of top
Communist leaders are gathered in Beijing to map out an economic
blueprint to sustain growth and drive the urbanization of
hundreds of millions of rural residents.  “There’s a cautious tone with China’s third plenum going
on,” said Stan Shamu, a Melbourne-based market strategist at IG
Ltd. “The Aussie is starting to get comfortable below 94 U.S.
cents.”  China’s growth will slow to 7.6 percent this year compared
with 7.7 percent in 2012, and then further decelerate to 7.4
percent in 2014, according to the median estimates of economists
in a Bloomberg poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
