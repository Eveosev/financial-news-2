Low Tuck Kwong, the billionaire
founder of Indonesian coal producer  PT Bayan Resources (BYAN) , was
defamed by former Bank of Honolulu chairman Sukamto Sia,
 Singapore ’s highest court ruled.  Sia’s claim in letters to  Indonesia ’s capital markets
regulator and stock exchange just before Bayan’s initial share
sale in 2008 that Low reneged on giving him a half stake in the
miner was false, a three-judge panel of the Singapore Court of
Appeal wrote in a Nov. 8 ruling.  As a result, Low was unable to sell his shares at the IPO,
the judges said in the 78-page decision. Low and Sia had been
embroiled in legal disputes for many years and Sia made
inconsistent assertions in Singapore and Hong Kong court
proceedings regarding his investment that allegedly entitled him
to the Bayan share, according to the ruling.  The amount of damages will be separately determined by a
lower court judge, according to the ruling. Low had sought S$334
million.  The judges also accepted Low’s lawyer  Davinder Singh ’s
argument that Sia’s claims were malicious. Low lost the
opportunity to invest the money he would have made by selling hs
shares at the IPO, according to the decision.  Low’s 52 percent  stake  in Bayan is worth about $1.3
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bayan raised
4.83 trillion rupiah ($419 million) in an initial share sale in
August 2008.  Bayan shares were unchanged at 8,700 on the Jakarta stock
exchange yesterday, giving it a market value of 29 trillion
rupiah.  The case is Low Tuck Kwong v Sukamto Sia. CA173/2012.
