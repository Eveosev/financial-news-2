Williams, Formula One’s only
publicly traded team, hired  Felipe Massa  to replace Pastor
Maldonado next season.  Massa is leaving Ferrari, where he raced since 2006, after
losing his place there. In a statement, Williams said it will
retain Valtteri Bottas to be his teammate.  Williams won the last of its nine team titles in 1997 and
has scored a single point after 17 of 19 races this season. Its
share price has fallen 31.5 percent this year.  Massa is the latest Brazilian to race for Grove, England-based, Williams. They included  Ayrton Senna , who was killed in a
racing accident in 1994.  “Williams is one of the most successful and important
teams of all time in Formula One,” Massa said in the statement.
“When I was a kid I always dreamed about racing for  Williams (WGF1) ,
Ferrari or McLaren and I’m glad to be signing with another icon
of the sport following my time at Ferrari.”  Massa will be replaced by former champion Kimi Raikkonen at
Ferrari next season.  Williams didn’t give a reason for Maldonado’s departure.
Hiring the Venezuelan in late 2010 brought the team sponsorship
from the country’s state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA.
He scored Williams’s only point this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
