 Bayerische Landesbank Chief
Executive Officer Gerd Haeusler offered to stay until the end of
March, three months longer than planned, as the bank hasn’t
identified a successor, said a person with knowledge of the
matter.  Haeusler is willing to remain at the Munich-based bank to
help find a suitable successor, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the negotiations are private. Florian Ernst, spokesman for BayernLB, declined to comment by telephone
today.  Haeusler, 62, said in September that he will step down from
 Germany ’s second-biggest state-owned bank by the end of the year
after selling assets as part of an agreement to repay 5 billion
euros ($6.7 billion) in state aid. BayernLB expects a profit
this year after second-quarter pretax profit jumped more than
fourfold to 563 million euros.  Salaries at BayernLB were capped at 500,000 euros after the
bailout in 2008. Haeusler’s five-year contract was due to run
until April 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
