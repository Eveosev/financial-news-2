(Corrects Australian confidence figure in eighth
paragraph, date of  Japan  GDP release in 19th in story originally
published Nov. 12.)  The dollar strengthened to a two-month high against the yen as signs the world’s largest economy
is gathering momentum boosted the appeal of the U.S. currency.  New Zealand’s dollar fell to a seven-week low as the
central bank said it sees signs that restrictions introduced
last month to prevent a housing bubble are starting to work. The
greenback rose versus most of its 16 major peers as a gauge of
national business activity improved after payroll gains last
week topped forecasts. The yen declined before the government
releases its quarterly economic-growth data on Nov. 14. Ten-year
Treasury note yields rose to the highest since Sept. 18.  “We’re looking at this as a stabilization here and it
looks like the dollar is pretty well supported,” Eric Viloria,
a senior currency strategist at Gain Capital Group LLC in New
York, said in a phone interview. “Dollar-yen has been breaking
higher and it looks like the relationship between dollar-yen and
U.S. Treasury yields has been strengthening.”  The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 99.64 yen at 5 p.m. in New
York after advancing to 99.80 yen, the strongest level since
Sept. 13. It last touched 100 yen on Sept. 11. The U.S. currency
fell 0.2 percent to $1.3436 per euro. The yen weakened 0.7
percent to 133.87 per euro.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which monitors the
greenback against 10 major counterparts, rose 0.1 percent to
1,022.05 after reaching 1,025.01, the highest since Sept. 13.  Benchmark  10-year yields  climbed three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 2.77 percent after reaching 2.79
percent. Similar maturity Japanese government bonds yielded 0.59
percent.  Kiwi, Aussie  New Zealand’s currency extended losses as the central bank
said a fall in home-building approvals and a drop in attendance
at open homes are evidence that the limits on low-deposit
lending are “starting to affect the housing market.”  The so-called kiwi fell for a fourth day, dropping 0.4
percent to 82.21 U.S. cents after declining as much as 1
percent. It touched 81.69, the weakest level since Sept. 17.  Australia’s dollar fell for a fourth day as a sentiment
gauge among businesses dropped to 5 in October from 12 the prior
month, National  Australia  Bank Ltd. said. A measure of business
conditions was unchanged at minus 4.  The Aussie dropped 0.6 percent to 93.02 U.S. cents after
sliding to 92.69 cents, the lowest level since Sept. 16.  Pound, Krona  The pound fell for a third day versus the dollar and euro
as the National Statistics Office said annual  consumer-price
inflation  slowed to 2.2 percent last month from 2.7 percent in
September, less than the 2.5 percent rate predicted in a
Bloomberg survey. The Bank of England publishes new economic
forecasts in its quarterly Inflation Report tomorrow.  Sterling dropped 0.5 percent to $1.5905 after falling to
$1.5855, the lowest level since Sept. 13. Sterling slid 0.8
percent to 84.48 pence per euro.  Sweden’s krona weakened to a 17-month low versus the euro
after a report showed the nation unexpectedly returned to
deflation last month, boosting speculation the central bank will
cut interest rates.  The krona slid 1.6 percent to 8.9387 per euro after
declining to 8.9425, the weakest since June 2012.  ‘Dollar Strength’  The U.S. dollar extended gains after the Chicago Federal
Reserve  national index  rose to 0.14 in September from a revised
0.13 the month before, with 47 of the 85 monthly individual
indicators making positive contributions.  The greenback rose 0.6 percent last week after a gain of
204,000 workers in October topped all forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey.  “The dollar has been outperforming other currencies in the
wake of last week’s number -- we’re still sort of riding the
coattail of that into this week,’” Fabian Eliasson, head of
U.S. currency sales in New York at Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,
said in a phone interview. “It’s a continuation of broad dollar
strength.”  The Bloomberg U.S.  Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS) , which
combines everything from money-market rates to yields on
government and corporate bonds to equity volatility, climbed 0.4
percent to 1.825, set for the highest closing level in data
starting in January 1994.  The yen declined against most of its major counterparts
today before the Cabinet Office reports Nov. 14 that Japan’s
 economic growth  slowed to 0.4 percent in the third quarter from
0.9 percent in the previous three months, according to a
Bloomberg News survey.  100 Yen  “There’s a strong chance that the dollar hits 100 yen in
the next day or so,” said Adam Myers, European head of foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank
in  London . “The dollar will move higher versus the yen as the
market will bring forward its estimate for U.S. tapering.”  The dollar will appreciate to 103 yen in six months and 105
within a year, Myers said, citing Credit Agricole’s forecasts.
It hasn’t reached 105 since October 2008.  Policy makers will pare the monthly pace of bond buying to
$70 billion at their March 18-19 meeting from the current pace
of $85 billion, according to the median of 32 economist
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey on Nov. 8. The median
forecast in an Oct. 17-18 survey of 40 economists also called
for a reduction to $70 billion in March.  The dollar has gained 4.3 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-nation currencies. The yen tumbled 11 percent, while the euro
appreciated 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
