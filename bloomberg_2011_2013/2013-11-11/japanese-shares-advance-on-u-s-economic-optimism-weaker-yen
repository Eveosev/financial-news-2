Japanese  shares  rose, with the Topix
index advancing for the first time in three days, after a
better-than-forecast U.S. jobs report added to signs of growth
in the world’s biggest economy and weakened the yen.  Honda Motor Co., which gets more than 80 percent of its
sales abroad, climbed 1.7 percent. Yokogawa Electric Corp.
jumped 6.4 percent after the chipmaker raised its net-income
outlook. Furukawa Electric Co. fell the most on the Nikkei 225
Stock Average after the cable maker maintained a profit forecast
that missed analyst estimates. Marubeni Corp., a trading company
that finalized its takeover of Gavilon Group LLC in July, lost
4.2 percent after cutting its profit estimate for the U.S. grain
distributor by almost two-thirds.  The  Topix (TPX)  gained 0.8 percent to 1,185.65 at the close in
Tokyo. The measure last week fell 0.6 percent to a one-month
low. The Nikkei 225 today rose 1.3 percent to 14,269.84. The yen
traded at 99 per dollar after sliding 1 percent to 99.05 on Nov.
8, its biggest decline in seven weeks.  “Expectations for the U.S. economic recovery have thrust
aside any concerns for the tapering of quantitative easing,”
said Toshiyuki Kanayama, a senior market analyst at Monex
Securities Inc. “With the yen being in the 99 range to the
dollar, and with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a
high again, we’re likely to see widespread buying of Japanese
shares.”  U.S. employers added 204,000 workers last month after a
revised 163,000 gain in September that was larger than
previously estimated, Labor Department figures showed Nov. 8.
The increase in payrolls topped the most optimistic forecast in
a survey of economists and spurred a 1.3 percent advance for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, while the Dow closed at a record.  Taper Timeframe  Futures on the S&P 500 dropped 0.1 percent today after
gaining 1.3 percent on Nov. 8. The Federal Reserve will pare the
monthly pace of bond buying to $70 billion at a March 18-19
meeting from the current $85 billion, according to the median of
32 economist estimates in a Bloomberg News survey last week.  Honda gained 1.7 percent to 3,935 yen. Nissan Motor Co.,
which counts North America as its biggest market, rose 1.6
percent to 897 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera
maker, rose 0.5 percent to 3,100 yen.  The Topix trailed the 23 other developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg in October, rising less than 0.1 percent, after Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe decided to implement a sales-tax increase
starting in April. The measure remains the best performer in the
group this year as unprecedented monetary easing by the Bank of
Japan weakened the yen, improving the profit outlook for
exporters.  Company Profits  Earnings season continues in Japan with more than 300 Topix
companies  reporting  this week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Profit per share on the gauge is expected to increase
45 percent from the previous quarter, according to analyst
projections compiled by Bloomberg.  Of the 255 companies that have reported quarterly earnings
and for which Bloomberg has estimates, 61 percent beat profit
expectations,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Yokogawa Electric rose 6.4 percent to 1,328 yen, the
biggest gain since May 21. The company raised its full-year net-income forecast by 7.4 percent to 14.5 billion yen, while also
boosting its outlook for operating profit 6.2 percent.  Citizen Holdings Co. jumped 7.1 percent to 722 yen, the
steepest advance on the Nikkei 225. The watchmaker raised its
full-year profit projection to 13 billion yen, beating the 12.6
billion yen average estimate of 10 analysts  surveyed  by
Bloomberg.  Furukawa Electric  Furukawa Electric sank 7 percent to 226 yen, its biggest
drop since May 23. The company posted a 11 percent decline in
net income to 2.3 billion yen and maintained its full-year
forecast at 5 billion yen, missing the 6.7 billion yen estimate
of 10 analysts.  Marubeni dropped 4.2 percent to 716 yen. Gavilon may post
net income of 5.4 billion yen to 5.5 billion yen in the fiscal
year ending March 31, with profit crimped by a drought in the
U.S. last year, Marubeni Chief Financial Officer Yokihiko
Matsumura said at a briefing in Tokyo on Nov. 8. Matsumura in
August forecast more than 15 billion yen in profit from Gavilon
this year, with gains expected from a revaluation of the asset.  Data today showed Japan’s current account surplus
unexpectedly expanded in September to the widest since April as
a weaker yen boosted the value of overseas investment income.
The surplus rose 14.3 percent from a year earlier to 587 billion
yen ($5.9 billion), against a median estimate for a 401 billion
yen gap in a survey of 24 economists. The income surplus gained
24.6 percent to a record for September, boosted by higher
interest receipts and dividends from foreign investments.  The Topix traded at 1.22 times book value today, compared
with 2.56 for the S&P 500 and 1.80 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index on Nov. 8. The Japanese measure’s 30-day  volatility  was
16.7 today, compared with its five-year median of 19.1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
