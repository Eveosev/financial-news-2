Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the largest
maker of devices using Google Inc.’s Android software, will
release its first smartphone using the Tizen operating system at
least four months later than previously forecast.  The first handset will be sold through Japan’s NTT Docomo
Inc. and France’s  Orange SA (ORA)  in February, Yi Woo Bok, a principal
engineer at Samsung’s software R&D Center, said in Seoul today.
Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung said in March its first device
using the open-source software would be released by September.  Samsung, which released the Galaxy S4 and Note 3 this year,
planned a Tizen device as one of three new high-end smartphones
to compete with Apple Inc. in the most-profitable segment of the
handset market.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and Huawei
Technologies Co. are among companies backing the software, which
 can be used  in mobile phones, tablet computers, televisions and
cars.  “We’re trying to prepare every technology that we can come
up with since it’s hard to predict how the market will change,”
Yi said in an interview at the Tizen Developer Summit. “The
advantage of Tizen over other competitors is that it has the
best technology to make devices more compatible with each
other.”  The software will support wearable devices in the future,
said Mark Skarpness, director of systems engineering at Intel’s
Open Source Technology Center.  Samsung sold about 120 million handsets in the third
quarter for a 28.7 percent market share, researcher Strategy
Analytics said Oct. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
