Malaysia’s ringgit dropped to a one-month low after U.S. jobs data topped estimates, bolstering the
case for the Federal Reserve to cut its stimulus earlier than
predicted. Government bonds declined.  The ringgit fell along with other Asian currencies after
official data on Nov. 8 showed employers in the world’s largest
economy added 204,000 workers in October, beating the most
optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Overseas
investors boosted holdings of Malaysian government debt by 7.6
percent to 228.6 billion ringgit ($72 billion) in September,
after three straight months of declines.  “Asian currencies are falling because the non-farm payroll
data support the case for the Fed to cut stimulus,” said
Jonathan Cavenagh, a Singapore-based currency strategist at
Westpac Banking Corp. “The ringgit is also vulnerable to
capital flight as it has one of the highest foreign ownership of
bonds in this region.”  The currency weakened 0.5 percent to 3.1945 per dollar as
of 9:34 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier touched 3.1995, the lowest since Oct. 10.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, rose eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 9.12 percent.  Industrial output  in the Southeast Asian nation held at 2.3
percent in September, the same as in the preceding month,
according to the median forecast of economists polled by
Bloomberg News before data due today.  The yield on the government’s 3.48 percent bonds due March
2023 climbed two basis points to 3.74 percent, the highest since
Oct. 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has risen
13 basis points this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
