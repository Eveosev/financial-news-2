Rubber rebounded to the highest
level in almost a week after  Japan ’s currency slid on U.S. and
Chinese data that exceeded analyst estimates, boosting the
appeal of yen-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in April on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange advanced as much as 1.9 percent to 261.7 yen a kilogram
($2,641 a metric ton), the highest since Nov. 5. Futures traded
at 261.1 at 9:57 a.m., paring losses to 14 percent this year.  The yen traded near a seven-week low against the dollar
after dropping 1 percent on Nov. 8, when data showed U.S.
payrolls added almost twice as many workers as economists
projected last month. Factory output in China rose more than
analysts estimated in October and inflation quickened less than
forecast, adding optimism about the growth in the world’s
second-largest economy.  “The data increased investors’ risk appetite, weakening
the yen and boosting futures in Tokyo,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an
analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  Natural rubber imports by China, the biggest buyer, were
190,000 tons in October, according to the customs agency. Volume
increased from 179,921 tons in September and 170,409 tons in the
same month last year, Bloomberg data showed.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
climbed 0.6 percent to 19,595  yuan  a ton. Stockpiles monitored
by the bourse rose 4.4 percent to 154,194 tons, the highest
since November 2004, data from the exchange showed.  Thai rubber free-on-board gained 0.6 percent to 78.05 baht
($2.47) a kilogram Nov. 8, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
