Cocoa fell to a one-week low in New
York on speculation investors who hold record bullish bets will
start to sell futures to lock in profits. Coffee gained.  Speculators were net-long, or betting on rising prices, by
69,808 cocoa contracts in the week ended Nov. 5, data from the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission compiled by Bloomberg
showed. That was the highest since the data started being
published in 2006. Cocoa prices, which gained 19 percent this
year on speculation of shortages, slid 4.6 percent since
reaching this year’s high of $2,780 a metric ton on Oct. 22.  “A classic break-out failure has occurred at the critical
$2,700-a-ton resistance area, offering a major technical sell
signal and the opportunity for a crash-down kind of market,”
Shawn Hackett, the president of Hackett Financial Advisors in
Boynton Beach, Florida, said in a report e-mailed yesterday. “I
expect prices to move down to $2,300 in the months ahead.”  Cocoa for March delivery fell 0.7 percent to $2,651 a ton
by 6:07 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Nov. 4. Futures trading volumes were
amost double the average for the past 100 days for this time of
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cocoa for the same
delivery month slid 0.7 percent to 1,696 pounds ($2,711) a ton
on NYSE Liffe in London.  Futures gained in New York this year on forecasts for
shortages. Supplies will fall short of demand by 203,000 tons in
the 2013-14 season began last month, according to data on the
website of KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodities Risk Analysis
in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. That follows a deficit of 221,000
tons a year earlier, the data showed.  ‘Bullish’ Pillars  “Cocoa has been riding two major bullish pillars in the
steady bull move since the summertime,” Hackett said. “One has
been dry weather in the Ivory Coast and the second is the view
of apparent strong demand in Europe and the United States. Both
bullish pillars have been overplayed and have already been
factored into current high prices.”  NYSE Liffe will update trader holdings position later
today. As of Oct. 29, money managers held record bets on higher
London cocoa prices at 67,131 contracts, exchange  data  showed.
The bourse started publishing trader positions in 2001.  Arabica coffee for delivery in December rallied 1.1 percent
to $1.0515 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for delivery in
January was little changed at $1,477 a ton in London.  Arabica futures rallied as investors’ bets on lower prices
reached a record 40,195 contracts as of Nov. 5, fueling
speculation money managers would start to buy futures, data from
the Washington-based CFTC showed.  Raw sugar for delivery in March gained 0.2 percent to 18.12
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. Refined, or white, sugar for
the same delivery month was little changed at $480.70 a ton on
NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
