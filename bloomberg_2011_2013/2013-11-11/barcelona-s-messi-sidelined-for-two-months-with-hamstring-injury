Lionel Messi , the record four-time
world soccer player of the year, won’t play for six to eight
weeks after tearing a hamstring last night, his Barcelona team
said.  Messi was substituted after 19 minutes of a Spanish league
game at Real Betis when he hurt his left thigh,  Barcelona said
in a statement  on its website.  It’s his third injury this season. He missed a week after
bruising a thigh in August and sat out three weeks last month
because of a muscle tear in his right thigh.  Messi will recuperate in Barcelona and then in Buenos Aires
in his native Argentina, Barcelona said. The club  doesn’t have
any matches for two weeks  after a Dec. 22 game at Getafe because
of the mid-season Spanish league break.  Barcelona beat Betis 4-1 yesterday to open a three-point
lead over  Atletico Madrid  atop Spain’s La Liga.
