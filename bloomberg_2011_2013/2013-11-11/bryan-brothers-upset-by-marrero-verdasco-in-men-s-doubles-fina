David Marrero and Fernando Verdasco
upset top-seeded Americans Bob and Mike Bryan for the doubles
title at the season-ending tournament of the men’s tennis tour.  The Spanish pair won 7-5, 6-7 (3-7), 10-7 on the hard
courts of the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 arena in  London .
The Bryans had won each of their previous three meetings -- all
on clay courts -- with Marrero and Verdasco.  Marrero and Verdasco earn $335,500 for their tournament,
while the American twins split $195,500 for finishing second.
The Bryans are three-time champions of the ATP event. It was the
first time the Spanish players reached the competition, which
brings together the top eight singles players and doubles teams
for a round-robin tournament.  The Bryans became the first team to hold all four Grand
Slam doubles titles at the same time since tennis went
professional in 1968 by winning their 15th major title at
Wimbledon this year. They took gold at the London Olympics and
then won four slams in a row.  Top-ranked Rafael Nadal takes on defending champion Novak Djokovic of  Serbia  in the men’s final tonight. The Spaniard lost
the 2010 final to record six-time champion Roger Federer, while
Djokovic is trying to join Boris Becker and John McEnroe as a
three-time winner, having taken the 2008 title.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
