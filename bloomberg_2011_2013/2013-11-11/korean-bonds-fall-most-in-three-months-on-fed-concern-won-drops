South Korea ’s  government bonds  fell
the most in four months after U.S. jobs data topped forecasts,
fueling speculation the  Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus
that has boosted  emerging markets . The won weakened.  American employers added 204,000 workers in October,
exceeding the most optimistic estimates in a Bloomberg survey of
economists, following a 163,000 increase in September that was
larger than initially assessed, official figures showed Nov. 8.
Overseas investors  sold  $726 million more South Korean bonds
than they bought this month through Nov. 8, according to
Financial Supervisory Service data. They pulled $450 million
from equities in the same period, exchange data show.  “After the surprisingly improved U.S. jobs data, the
pressure on the  bond market  is heightened on speculation that
the Fed may start tapering in December,” said Park Dongjin, a
fixed-income analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in  Seoul . “Foreign
investors continue to sell assets, which may be reflective of
their concerns about the Fed.”  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent sovereign bonds due
June 2016 advanced seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point,
to 2.96 percent in Seoul, the biggest increase since July 1,
according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices.  South Korea sold 1.77 trillion won ($1.7 billion) of five-year government bonds at a yield of 3.24 percent today,
according to the  Finance Ministry . The bid-to-cover ratio was at
3.823 times, the least since July.  Won Falls  Fed policy makers will pare the monthly pace of bond-buying
to $70 billion at their March 18-19 meeting, according to the
median estimate of 32 economists in a Bloomberg News survey Nov.
8. An Oct. 17-18 survey of 40 economists also forecast a
reduction to $70 billion in March.  The won dropped 0.7 percent to 1,072.46 per dollar, falling
the most since July 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 71 basis points to
6.91 percent.  South Korea plans to cut the budget for its currency
stabilization fund to 72.1 trillion won in 2014 from 80.5
trillion won this year, according to the government’s budget
proposals submitted to the parliament.  “Foreign-exchange losses have been a frequent hot topic
around this time of year among lawmakers,” said Oh Suk Tae, a
Seoul-based economist at SG Securities Co. “I don’t think the
reduction in the currency stabilization fund will have any
impact on the Bank of Korea’s capability to intervene.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
