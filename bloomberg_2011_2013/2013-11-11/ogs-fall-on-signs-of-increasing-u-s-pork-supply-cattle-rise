Hog futures declined for the eighth
session in 10 on speculation that rising U.S. pork output will
overwhelm demand. Cattle prices advanced.  Meatpackers processed an estimated 2.29 million animals in
the week ending Nov. 9, a 0.8 percent increase from a week
earlier, and the average carcass weight on Nov. 8 was 4.6 pounds
(2.1 kilograms) heavier than a year earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  “Increased slaughter and increased weights, that’s the
biggest thing out there,” Chad Henderson, a market analyst with
Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin ,
said in a telephone interview. “These weights are going to stay
really strong.”  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.1 percent to
close at 88.05 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The most-active contract is down 1.3 percent this
month.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1.3275 a pound on the CME, after touching $1.33, the highest
since Nov. 1.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement declined 0.2
percent to $1.64175 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
