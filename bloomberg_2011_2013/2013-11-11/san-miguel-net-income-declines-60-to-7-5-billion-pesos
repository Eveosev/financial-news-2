San Miguel Corp. (SMC) , the  Philippines ’
largest company, said nine-month profit slumped 60 percent after
foreign exchange losses.  Net income declined to 7.5 billion pesos ($172 million) in
the nine months through September from 18.7 billion pesos,
according to a  presentation  on the website of the Manila-based
company. It posted a foreign exchange loss of 12.3 billion pesos
in the period from currency gains a year earlier. Sales rose 7
percent to 542.6 billion pesos.  Shares fell 3.6 percent to 72 pesos, the lowest closing
price since Sept. 23, in Manila trading. The stock has declined
32 percent this year, compared with a 7.8 percent gain in the
benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index.  Profit in the third quarter was 9.9 billion pesos, based on
figures derived from the nine-month earnings reported by the
company. San Miguel, which had posted a first-half loss of 2.4
billion pesos, returned to profit in the third quarter after
agreeing to sell its stake in  Manila Electric Co. (MER)   The Philippines’ largest company by revenue agreed to sell
its 27 percent stake in Manila Electric, the nation’s largest
power distribution utility, for about $2 billion, President
Ramon Ang said on Sept. 30, helping fuel its expansion. San
Miguel, which started as a brewer more than 100 years ago, has
forayed into industries such as airlines, mining, power, oil and
infrastructure to boost returns.  Ang said on Nov. 6 he expects the peso to strengthen this
quarter, enabling San Miguel to remain profitable this year. The
Philippine currency declined almost 4 percent against the dollar
in the 12 months through September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
