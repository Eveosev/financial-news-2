Burundian authorities said they
discovered 39 human skulls at the home of an Italian man in the
capital, Bujumbura, after he had been arrested last month when
two skulls were detected by X-Ray machines at the East African
nation’s main airport.  Police have also detained a national of a nearby country,
where the skulls may have originated, Telesphore Bigirimana, a
spokesman for the East African nation’s intelligence agency,
said today in an interview. Giuseppe Favaro, an artist who
arrived in  Burundi  in 1989, has been charged with trading human
skulls, Bigirimana said.  Aviation authorities last week raised concern over illegal
trafficking through Bujumbura International Airport including
shipments of ivory, cocaine, marijuana and human body parts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
