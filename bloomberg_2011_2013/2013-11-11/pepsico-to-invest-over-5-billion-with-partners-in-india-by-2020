PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , the world’s largest
snack-food maker, will invest 330 billion rupees ($5.2 billion)
with its partners in India by 2020 as it increases manufacturing
capacity and adds new products.  The Purchase, New York-based company and its partners will
ramp up investment in delivery infrastructure in the world’s
second most populous nation with a focus on rural areas,
according to a statement yesterday.  “India is a country with huge potential and it remains an
attractive, high-priority market for PepsiCo,” Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  Indra Nooyi  said in the statement.
“We’ve only scratched the surface of the long-term growth
opportunities that exist for PepsiCo and our partners.”  The company and rival Coca-Cola Co. are vying for a bigger
chunk of developing countries’ business as growth rates in  Asia ,
the Middle East and Africa are four to five times those in the
U.S. and  Europe , according to PepsiCo. It generated about half
its $65.5 billion in revenue last year from outside the U.S.  India is one of Pepsico’s biggest markets globally and the
investments will also help expand the range of food and drinks
it sells in the South Asian nation, according to the statement.  The investment from the international drinks maker is a
boost for the country, which battled capital outflows and a
plunging currency earlier this year.  India’s economy  will grow 5
percent in the year through March 2014, the central bank has
forecast, matching the previous year’s expansion, which was the
slowest since 2003.  Rural Surge  Even as India’s economy has slowed, farm wages adjusted for
inflation  rose  almost 7 percent on average annually in the five
years through March 2012, from 1 percent in the previous decade,
according to India’s Planning Commission. Rural  consumer
spending  surged 19 percent a year to $69 billion from 2009
through 2012, exceeding the $55 billion in cities and large
towns.  PepsiCo, owner of the Frito-Lay, Gatorade and Quaker Oats
brands, said it plans to expand the production capacity with its
partners in  India  to more than double current levels by 2020.  The U.S. company, which opened its first operations in
India in 1990, added more spicy offerings and recruited
Bollywood actors as brand ambassadors to get a greater share of
India’s snack market, which researcher Euromonitor Plc projects
will be worth 268 billion rupees by 2018.  PepsiCo’s share of the carbonated beverage market in India
fell to 36.4 percent last year, from 40.1 percent in 2007,
according to data from Euromonitor. Coca-Cola’s share rose to
60.9 percent from 57 percent in the same period. Both companies
are counting on growth from a low consumption base of soft
drinks in India to drive sales of their products.  PepsiCo shares gained about 25 percent this year, compared
with a 24 percent increase for the  Standard & Poor’s  500 index
and a 10 percent rise for Coca-Cola’s stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
