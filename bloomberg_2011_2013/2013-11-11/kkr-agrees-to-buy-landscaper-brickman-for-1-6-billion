KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm
led by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , agreed to buy landscape-maintenance company Brickman Group Ltd. from Leonard Green &
Partners LP for $1.6 billion.  KKR’s investment will come from its 11th North American
buyout fund as well as other pools, the New York-based firm said
in a statement today. Leonard Green & Partners, a Los Angeles-based private-equity firm, acquired closely held Brickman in
2006 for an undisclosed sum, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Private-equity firms are investing in landscaping
businesses as construction picks up following the financial
crisis. Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC, the buyout firm led by Don Gogel, last month agreed to buy the majority of Deere & Co.’s
landscaping business in a $465 million deal. U.S. housing starts
have risen 19 percent in the past year, according to national
data released Nov. 8.  “We are excited to invest in the company and look forward
to working closely with the Brickman leadership team to continue
to build on the company’s market-leading position,” Simon
Brown, KKR’s head of consumer-products investing, said in the
statement today.  KKR was advised by Credit Suisse Group AG and received
legal advice from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. Brickman,
based in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , received advice from Barclays
Plc, Morgan Stanley, Latham & Watkins LLP and Dechert LLP.  KKR expects to finish raising its latest North American
buyout fund by year-end with more than $8.3 billion, it said
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
