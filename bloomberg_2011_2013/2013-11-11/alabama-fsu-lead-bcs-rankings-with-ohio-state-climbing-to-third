The University of  Alabama  and
Florida State remain the top two teams in college football’s
Bowl Championship Series standings, while unbeaten Ohio State
moved up to third after  Oregon ’s first loss of the season.  Two-time defending national champion Alabama improved its
record to 9-0 by scoring the final 21 points to pull away for a
38-17 home victory over No. 21 Louisiana State two days ago. The
Crimson Tide has a .996 rating out of 1.000 in the BCS
standings, which determine the two teams to play for the
national title on Jan. 6 in  Pasadena ,  California .  Florida State is also 9-0 after a 59-3 rout of Wake Forest
and solidified its hold on the No. 2 ranking, with a BCS rating
of .962. Ohio State (9-0) was off in week 11 of its schedule,
yet moved up one spot. Stanford (8-1) climbed to fourth from
fifth after its 26-20 home win against Oregon. The Ducks (8-1)
fell to sixth, one spot behind Baylor (8-0).  Ohio State has an .893 rating, with Stanford at .869,
Baylor at .862 and Oregon at .767.  Auburn (9-1), Clemson (8-1), Missouri (9-1) and South
Carolina (7-2) round out the top 10 in the BCS standings, which
are determined by the Harris Interactive Poll, the USA Today
coaches’ poll and an average of six computer polls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
