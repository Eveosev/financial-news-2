Cap SA (CAP) ,  Chile ’s largest steel
producer and iron miner, fell for a third straight day as an
increase in operating costs led to quarterly earnings that
trailed analysts’ estimates.  The shares fell 2.6 percent to 10,549 pesos at 3:20 p.m. in
Santiago, the lowest level on a closing basis since Oct. 29. The
IPSA benchmark index retreated 1.2 percent.  Cap reported a profit of $64.2 million in the third
quarter, below the $85.2 million average forecast of three
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  analysts
cited in an e-mailed research note to clients a 26 percent
increase in mining costs from a year earlier that overshadowed a
24 percent advance in iron-ore shipments and an 11 percent gain
in prices.  “Costs continue to rise in mining and steel,” Rodrigo Ordonez and Francisco Errandonea of Santander wrote. “This was
the main surprise to our estimates and market consensus.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
