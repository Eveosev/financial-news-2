Eighteen bottles of 2009 Carruades de de Lafite, the second wine of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, sold the equivalent of 1,650 pounds ($2,643) a case on Liv-ex in London this month, taking the vintage to a six-month low.  The transaction, on Nov. 1, was 11 percent down from this year’s peak of 1,850 pounds reached in February, and took the wine back to the level it traded at in both April of this year and November 2012, data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website shows.  The  Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index , tracking leading Bordeaux vintages, has declined since March 15, erasing an 8 percent gain made in the previous 11 weeks to leave it down 0.2 percent since the end of last year.  “Carruades and Lafite are now back to their February 2010 price levels,” Liv-ex said in its market blog.  The price compares with its range between 1,838 pounds and 2,600 pounds in June 2010, when the wine first started trading on the market.  Lafite , a first-growth wine estate in Pauillac on the left bank of the Gironde, is one of the highest-priced growers of Medoc along with Chateau Latour, Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and Chateau Margaux. Lafite’s second wine can benefit when investors shun the region’s more expensive rivals.  Family Estate  The market price of the 2009 Carruades de Lafite, while the most expensive of the past four years, is cheaper than the entire sequence of vintages between 1991 and 2005, according to merchant data compiled by Liv-ex.  The vintage was rated 93 on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic  Robert Parker  in a February 2012 online tasting note, putting it among the top three wines of the past 15 years, according to the eRobertParker website.  Carruades contains a higher percentage of Merlot than Lafite’s main wine and can sell at less than one-quarter of the price, according to Liv-ex data. The 2009 vintage of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild traded at 7,183 pounds per case on Liv-ex last week.  Lafite has more than 100 hectares (247 acres) planted with red-grape vines. Cabernet Sauvignon typically makes up between 80 percent to 95 percent of its main wine, with Merlot from 5 percent to 20 percent, and smaller quantities of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  The vineyards, owned by  Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) , date back at least to the 17th century and the estate has been under the control of the Rothschild family since 1868, when Baron James de Rothschild, then head of its French branch, acquired the property.
