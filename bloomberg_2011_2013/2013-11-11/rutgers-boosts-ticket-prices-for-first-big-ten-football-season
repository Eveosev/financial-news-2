Rutgers University will increase
football season-ticket prices $18 to $30 for all six home games,
and the donations required to buy those tickets $25 to $100 per
ticket for next year’s inaugural season in the Big Ten
Conference, the school said in a  press release .  Season tickets range in price from $150 in the upper deck
to $330 for sideline seats. The donations for those seats, which
are 80 percent tax deductible, can cost as much as $350 each,
the school said.  “We’re all excited about getting into the Big Ten with the
Michigans and Penn States coming,” said Geoff Brown, chief
marketing officer for the Rutgers athletic department. “We had
a nice bump for this season and we expect a similar bump again
going into 2014.”  Season tickets increased by about 3,500 to 22,300 this
season, Brown said. Highpoint Solutions Stadium in Piscataway,
New Jersey, seats 52,454 fans, according to the school’s website.  Rutgers’ 2014 home  football schedule  includes four games
against Big Ten opponents: Penn State on Sept. 13;  Michigan , Oct.
4;  Wisconsin , Nov. 1; and  Indiana , Nov. 15.  The Scarlet Knights are 5-3 this season, including 2-2 in
the American Athletic Conference, and host Cincinnati (7-2, 4-1)
on Nov. 16.  Current season ticket holders can renew or buy additional
seats beginning Nov. 15, while new season-ticket holders can
purchase tickets Nov. 22.  Maryland Boost  The University of Maryland also will join the Big Ten next
season, from the Atlantic Coast Conference.  Matt Monroe, the Terrapins associate athletic director of
ticket services, said the school increased football season
ticket sales by 1,291 this season to 17,654 at 51,802-seat
Capital One Field at Byrd Stadium in College, Park, Maryland.  New ticket prices and donation levels will be announced in
December, Monroe said. The Ohio State game has drawn the most
attention from fans, Monroe said.  Maryland  has six home games in 2014, including four against
Big Ten opponents: Ohio State, Oct. 4;  Iowa , Oct. 18; Michigan
State, Nov. 22; and Rutgers Nov. 29 in the regular season finale.  “Since the announcement that we were going to the Big Ten,
there has been a general enthusiasm for the program,” Monroe
said in a telephone interview. “We anticipate that trend to
continue as we look forward to 2014.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
