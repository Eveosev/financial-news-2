U.S.  stocks  rose, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average extending a record, as investors awaited
retailer earnings reports to gauge the strength of consumer
demand and the likelihood of cuts to monetary stimulus.  Transocean Ltd. added 3.6 percent after the offshore rig
contractor agreed with investor  Carl Icahn  to propose a $3 per
share dividend. ViroPharma Inc. jumped 26 percent as Shire Plc.
bought the company for about $4.2 billion. Best Buy Co. rose 4.5
percent after a UBS AG analyst upgraded the stock. KKR & Co.
fell 1.5 percent after it bought Brickman Group Ltd. for $1.6
billion.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1 percent to
1,771.89 at 4 p.m. in New York to close within a point of its
record. The Dow rose 21.32 points, or 0.1 percent, to 15,783.1.
About 4.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges today,
21 percent below the three-month average. Bond markets were
closed because of the Veterans Day holiday.  “Sometimes a boring day is nice,”John Carey, a portfolio
manager at Pioneer Investment Management who oversees $200
billion in assets globally, said by phone from  Boston . “People
will be watching over the next few weeks to see if the Fed does
decide to begin tapering this year. If earnings continue
trending higher the support will be there for better share
prices.”  The S&P 500 added 0.5 percent last week for a fifth week of
gains, the longest streak since February. Better-than-forecast
data on jobs and growth indicated the economy is strong enough
to withstand a reduction in Federal Reserve stimulus, even as
consumer spending climbed last quarter at the slowest pace since
2011. There were no economic reports today.  Earnings Scorecard   Corporate earnings  that surpassed estimates and
unprecedented monetary support from the Federal Reserve have
propelled the S&P 500 higher by more than 160 percent from a
March 2009 low.  Of the 449 S&P 500 companies that have released third-quarter profits so far, 75 percent have beaten analysts’
forecasts,  data  compiled by Bloomberg showed. Earnings per share
for the companies on the gauge probably increased 4.7 percent in
the third quarter, and will rise 6.2 percent in the fourth,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We can put in the books that the third quarter earnings
season was another positive surprise,” Phil Orlando, New York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors,
said by phone. His firm oversees about $380 billion in assets.
“The market was way too pessimistic going in.”  News Corp. was the only S&P 500 member to post results
today, releasing its report after the market closed. Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., Macy’s Inc. and Nordstrom Inc. are among retail
companies reporting earnings later this week. Home Depot Inc.
posts results on Nov. 19.  ‘Fairly Restrained’  “Investors want to know the strength of the U.S. consumer
going into what might be a tepid holiday season,” said Alison Porter, who helps oversee $108 billion as U.S. equities fund
manager at Ignis Asset Management. “Consumer spending has been
fairly restrained. With big retailers like Wal-Mart and Home
Depot yet to report, we’ll want to see whether that has picked
up.”  Economists still forecast the Fed will delay tapering asset
purchases until March even after the payrolls data beat
forecasts. Policy makers will probably pare the monthly pace of
bond buying, known as quantitative easing, to $70 billion at
their March 18-19 meeting from the current pace of $85 billion,
according to the median of 32 estimates in a Bloomberg survey
Nov. 8. The median forecast in an Oct. 17-18 survey of 40
economists also called for a cut to $70 billion in March.  “There’s been a correlation between rising share prices
and low interest rates and the QE program,” Carey said.
“People legitimately are wondering if and when the Fed begins
the tapering.”  Equity Valuations  The S&P 500 has rallied 24 percent in 2013, heading for the
best annual gain in a decade. The gauge is trading at 16 times
projected earnings, more than the five-year average of 14 times
earnings, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors have poured money into exchange-traded funds
tracking U.S. stocks, pushing assets in the iShares Core S&P 500
ETF above the Vanguard FTSE  Emerging Markets (VWO)  ETF for the first
time since 2010. The iShares S&P 500 fund manages $50.5 billion,
compared with $48.3 billion for the ETF linked to shares of
developing nations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is the world’s largest ETF with about
$156 billion.  ’Look Deeper’  “Valuations are not as attractive and people need to look
deeper into the market to find better value,” Ignis’ Porter
said by phone from Glasgow.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , which
measures future volatility signaled by S&P 500 options, fell 2.9
percent to 12.53 today, a three-month low.  Six of 10 main  S&P 500 groups  advanced, with health-care
stocks rising 0.2 percent to pace the gains. Phone shares fell
0.3 percent for the worst performance in the broader index.  Transocean rose 3.6 percent to $55.37. The company agreed
with Icahn to pay about $1.1 billion in dividend and to increase
margins by $800 million through cost cutting. Transocean will
also back two of Icahn’s nominees to the board, whose size will
be cut to 11 directors from 14, according to a joint statement.  Deal Activity  ViroPharma rallied 26 percent to $49.42, it’s highest since
April 2000. Dublin-based Shire will pay $50 a share in cash for
the maker of drugs that treat some rare diseases, according to a
statement today.  Gogo Inc. (GOGO) , a provider of in-flight Internet services,
jumped 29 percent to a  record  $24.15 after the company raised
its year-end revenue estimate. Itasca, Illinois-based Gogo
reported a smaller third-quarter loss than analysts had
expected.  Amazon.com Inc. rose 1.2 percent to $354.38. The world’s
biggest online retailer said it is teaming up with the U.S.
Postal Service to offer Sunday delivery.  Best Buy added 4.5 percent to $44.33, the highest in almost
three years. UBS analyst Michael Lasser upgraded the stock to
buy from neutral. Lasser said he sees Best Buy estimates being
pushed higher when the company reports third quarter earnings on
Nov. 19.  FirstEnergy Corp. plunged 5.7 percent to $36.62, its
biggest drop since May. The public utility holding company said
yesterday it plans to spend $2.8 billion on transmissions
through 2017.  Homebuilder Slump  An S&P index of homebuilders dropped 0.7 percent for a
third day of declines.  D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) , which reports earnings
tomorrow, slid 0.4 percent to $18.06, the lowest in almost four
weeks.  Denbury Resources Inc. plunged 5.9 percent to $18.20 for
its biggest drop since June 2012 and the steepest slide in the
S&P 500. The petroleum producer yesterday said it would initiate
a regular quarterly dividend and not create a master limited
partnership, something the company in May said it was
considering.  KKR declined 1.5 percent to $23. The private-equity firm
led by Henry Kravis and  George Roberts  agreed to buy landscape-maintenance company Brickman from Leonard Green & Partners LP
for $1.6 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
