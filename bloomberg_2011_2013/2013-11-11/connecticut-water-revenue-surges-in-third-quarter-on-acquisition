Connecticut Water Service Inc. (CTWS) , the
biggest publicly traded water company in New England, reported
third-quarter profit surged 58 percent following the purchase of
a Maine water provider.  Revenue rose 12 percent to $29.6 million from the year-earlier period as net income reached $9.4 million after the
December acquisition of Biddeford & Saco Water Co., said the
Clinton, Connecticut-based utility that supplies drinking water
to about 400,000 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
