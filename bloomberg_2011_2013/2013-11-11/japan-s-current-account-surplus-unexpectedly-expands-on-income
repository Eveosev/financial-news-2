Japan ’s  current-account  surplus
exceeded economists’ forecasts in September as a weaker yen
boosted the value of overseas investment income.  The 14.3 percent gain from a year earlier to 587 billion
yen ($5.9 billion) compared with a median estimate for a 401
billion yen excess in a survey of 24 economists.  After seasonal adjustment, the surplus swung to a 125.2
billion yen deficit, a record low for data stretching back to
1996 and underscoring the drag on the economy from trade
deficits exacerbated by swelling energy costs and the yen’s
depreciation. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying to sustain a
recovery jump-started by fiscal and monetary stimulus.  “The current account will probably remain in surplus as a
robust income surplus will make up for the trade deficits,”
said  Masamichi Adachi , a senior economist at JPMorgan Chase &
Co. in  Tokyo  and a former central bank official.  The yen was little changed at 99.08 per dollar as of 7:07
p.m. in Tokyo, down about 20 percent for the past year. The
benchmark Topix index closed 0.8 percent higher.  The  income surplus gained 24.6 percent  to a record for
September, lifted by higher interest receipts and dividends from
foreign investments.  To contact the reporters on this story:
