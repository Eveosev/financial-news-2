Public Investment Corp., the largest
shareholder in South African drugmaker  Adcock Ingram Holdings
Ltd. (AIP) , doesn’t want CFR Pharmaceutical shares as part of a $1.2
billion takeover offer by the Chilean company, according to a
person familiar with the fund manager’s decision.  PIC,  South Africa ’s biggest money manager with an 18.6
percent stake in Adcock, would prefer an all-cash offer, the
person said, declining to be named because its discussions about
the proposal haven’t been made public. The possibility of Adcock
falling under foreign ownership as a result of a takeover by
Santiago-based CFR isn’t an issue, the person said.  CFR,  Chile ’s largest drugmaker, said in July it would pay
12.6 billion rand ($1.2 billion) in cash and shares for Adcock
as it seeks to expand in other  emerging markets . The company
said it would settle as much as 51 percent to 64.3 percent of
the purchase through cash and the balance with new CFR shares.  PIC said on Nov. 6 it wouldn’t support the proposal because
it wasn’t in the investor’s best interests. Adcock needs 75
percent of its shareholder base to back the deal for it to go
ahead, its chairman Khotso Mokhele said in September. The
company has received support from 45 percent of investors, it
said Oct. 30.  Adcock declined 0.8 percent to 67.60 rand as of 1:21 p.m.
in Johannesburg. The CFR offer values the drugmaker at 73.51
rand per Adcock share, according to both companies.  PIC didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed query seeking
further comment. The company oversees the pension funds of South
African government workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
