CaixaBank SA (CABK) , Spain’s third-biggest
bank, said it would issue bonds exchangeable for  Repsol SA (REP)  that
would enable it to free up capital by reducing its stake in the
oil company.  CaixaBank will issue about 620 million euros ($832 million)
of the bonds exchangeable into shares equivalent to as much as
2.5 percent of Repsol, the Barcelona-based lender said in a
filing to regulators today. Assuming the exchange takes place,
the bank plans to boost its core capital ratio incorporating the
complete, or “fully loaded,” criteria under Basel III rules,
now at 8.3 percent by 37 basis points, CaixaBank said.  CaixaBank is among Spanish lenders including Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA that have been reducing their stakes in
companies as they adapt to the new capital rules known as Basel
III that can punish them for holding them. CaixaBank holds 12
percent of Repsol, the bank said.  The three-year bonds will carry a fixed nominal interest
rate of 4.5 percent to 5 percent, CaixaBank said. The lender
said it could opt to exchange as much as 2.5 percent of Repsol,
pay cash or a combination of the two options. Citigroup Inc. and
Morgan Stanley are acting as joint bookrunners for the
transaction, it said.  BBVA said last month it would take a 2.3 billion-euro
charge for reducing its stake in China Citic Bank Corp. to free
up capital. CaixaBank said earlier year it would reduce its
stake in Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s Grupo Financiero
Inbursa SAB for the same reason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
