Mexico ’s peso dropped as a September
decline in construction led to a bigger-than-forecast slide in
industrial production.  The currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 13.2155 per U.S.
dollar at 4 p.m. in Mexico City. Yields on benchmark peso bonds
due in 2024 rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to
a two-month high of 6.35 percent.  Industrial output fell 1.6 percent in September from a year
earlier, the national statistics agency reported today. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
0.4 percent drop. Construction declined 8.3 percent.  “The construction sector shows that internal demand is at
a standstill, in housing as well as infrastructure,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist at Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB
in Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. “That’s the
issue, the weak performance of the Mexican economy.”  Policy makers were unanimous in their Oct. 25 decision to
cut the  target lending rate  by a quarter-percentage point to a
record low 3.5 percent, minutes published last week show. They
said that more reductions in the foreseeable future aren’t
advisable as the economy shows signs of recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
