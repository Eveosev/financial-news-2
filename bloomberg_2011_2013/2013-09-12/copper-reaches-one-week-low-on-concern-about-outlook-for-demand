Copper reached a one-week low in
 London  as reports of slumping prices, reduced industrial
production and higher unemployment from Germany to Australia
fanned concern about the outlook for demand.  Wholesale prices dropped the most since 2009 last month in
Germany, the world’s third-biggest copper consumer, the nation’s
statistics office said today. Industrial output unexpectedly
fell in  Italy , the third-largest euro-area economy. The
Australian dollar weakened after the nation’s jobless rate
touched the highest level in four years.  “The Aussie dollar selloff has influenced” metals prices,
said  Andrew Silver , a broker at Triland Metals Ltd. in London.
“It’s a thin market.”  Copper for delivery in three months declined 1 percent to
$7,097 a metric ton by 10:02 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange
after reaching $7,091.25, the lowest since Sept. 5. Copper for
delivery in December fell 0.9 percent to $3.2265 a pound on the
Comex in New York on trading volume that was 22 percent below
the average of the past 100 days for the time of day, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Prices are set to drop for a third week in four before the
 Federal Reserve ’s policy-making committee meets next week. The
central bank will reduce monthly bond-buying aimed at stoking
the economy in the U.S., the second-biggest copper user after
 China , by $10 billion to $75 billion at the Sept. 17-18 meeting,
economists said in a Bloomberg survey last week.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the LME declined for a sixth
session to 579,750 tons, daily bourse data showed. Orders to
remove the metal from warehouses, or canceled warrants, dropped
1.9 percent to 281,525 tons. Zinc canceled warrants jumped 3.1
percent, the most since Aug. 23, to 607,500 tons on gains in  New
Orleans  and Antwerp, Belgium.  Lead reached a five-week low in London and zinc touched the
lowest level in a week. Aluminum, nickel and tin slid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
