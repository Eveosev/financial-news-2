Michael Woodford is one of the world's preeminent monetary theorists, which is why you should read the  thorough profile  written about him by my colleagues at Bloomberg Markets. Buried inside the article is the  revelation  that Woodford wants the Federal Reserve to cut back on its asset purchases as soon as possible. That wasn't what I was expecting from a known advocate of "unconventional" monetary stimulus, so I asked him to explain his views more thoroughly. First, a little background. Among central bankers and those who watch them, Woodford is most associated with something called "forward guidance." The idea comes from a  2003 paper  he wrote with Gauti Eggertsson, then an economist at the International Monetary Fund. They were trying to come up with a way to stimulate weak economies after short rates had already fallen to zero percent. (Rates can theoretically go below zero but that would probably  make things worse .) Their insight was that central banks can theoretically suppress long-term interest rates by promising to keep short rates low for longer than traders expect. All of the big rich-country central banks have since adopted this approach. Last year, Woodford made a big splash by  arguing  that the Fed hadn't done nearly enough to boost the economy. He thinks that the U.S. central bank should commit to keeping short-term interest rates close to zero percent until economic output, expressed in current dollars, returns to its pre-crisis trend path. This output gap is currently about $2 trillion per year and rising. Most Fed officials, by contrast, generally  expect  to start raising rates sometime in 2015, if not earlier. When it comes to interest rates, in other words, Woodford supports much more aggressive stimulus than the people currently in charge of monetary policy. Woodford also argued that asset purchases were relatively ineffective except insofar as they corroborated the Fed's promises about interest rates. Purchases targeted at particular sectors of the economy, such as housing, might also help somewhat, according to Woodford, although those operations would be closer to fiscal policy than monetary policy. Woodford's agnosticism on asset purchases accords with recent  research  by Northwestern's Arvind Krishnamurthy and Berkeley's Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, which I discussed in a previous  post . None of this explains why Woodford "welcomes the Fed's intention to taper off its purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage debt." If the economy is still depressed and asset purchases are at worse useless and at best mildly beneficial, why not keep doing them? I e-mailed Woodford, who is currently traveling, and got a response that I think helps explain things. For Woodford, the most important point is that the Fed's balance sheet cannot keep growing without imposing costs on the financial system and broader economy -- even when inflation is low and unemployment is high. While Woodford didn't explicitly tell me what those costs were, a possible explanation can be found in this brief passage from the  paper  he presented at last year's Jackson Hole Economic Symposium: In other words, Treasury bonds are uniquely useful for savers. When the Fed makes these securities more expensive -- or restricts their supply through asset purchases -- the central bank harms regular savers without doing much to boost the broader economy. Moreover, the relative scarcity of newly-issued Treasury bonds has been causing  havoc  in the repo markets. Woodford suspects that the Fed agrees with him. In fact, he thinks that the pace of tapering will (and should) be determined almost exclusively by the size of the balance sheet rather than the health of the economy: Hopefully this explains why someone known as a monetary "dove" can support tapering without being inconsistent.
