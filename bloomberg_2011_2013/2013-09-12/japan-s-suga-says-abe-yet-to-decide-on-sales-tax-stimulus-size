Japan’s top government spokesman
said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has yet to decide whether to
raise the nation’s  sales tax  or the size of any stimulus package
to cushion the economic blow from the planned levy increase.  The Yomiuri newspaper said today Abe would announce an
increase in the tax as scheduled, along with 5 trillion yen ($50
billion) in economic measures.  Kyodo News  reported similar
information. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in
 Tokyo  the reports were not true, and the size of any package is
yet to be decided.  Stimulus measures would ease the blow to consumption from
the planned raising of the tax to 8 percent in April from 5
percent now, helping to prevent the nation’s economic revival
from stalling. Koichi Hamada and Etsuro Honda, two of Abe’s
advisers on economic policy, have cautioned against going ahead
with the scheduled tax increase.  Abe will announce his decision on whether to proceed on
Oct. 1, after the release of the Bank of  Japan ’s Tankan survey
of business sentiment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
