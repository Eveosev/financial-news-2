The Brazilian Congress approved the
reduction of billions of dollars worth of tax debt of big
companies’ profit from their foreign units in a move that may
benefit  Vale SA. (VALE3)   Senators yesterday approved a regulation that scraps fines
and interest if companies pay their debts in one tranche and
reduces taxes and interest should they pay their debts in
installments. The lower house voted the same on Monday, so the
text now goes to president  Dilma Rousseff  for final signing.  “This is very important to boost Brazilian companies,”
Senator Gim Argello, sponsor of the bill, said yesterday in a
phone interview from Brasilia. “In a time of crisis, government
should give up on tax collection so that companies can generate
more profit abroad.”  According to Valor Economico newspaper, the tax debt from
companies foreign units amount to 70 billion reais ($30.8
billion). Mining giant Vale’s debt is 30.5 billion reais. “If
companies decide to pay in one installment, this means that
their debt will be reduced to 20 percent of the full amount.”
Argello said.  Vale said it still hasn’t said whether it will accept the
new rules to negotiate its debt and it has until the Nov. 29
deadline to decide and inform the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
