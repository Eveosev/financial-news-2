Quebec ’s associate deputy finance
minister said he doesn’t see the province’s foreign borrowing
exceeding 20 percent of its debt sales.  “The swap market is behaving in a way these days that
makes foreign borrowing maybe a little bit more difficult,”
Bernard Turgeon said today at the Bloomberg Canadian Fixed
Income Conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
