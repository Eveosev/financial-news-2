Crude oil puts fell when futures
advanced as the U.S. opened talks in Geneva today with  Russia 
over  Syria ’s alleged use of chemical weapons.  Implied volatility of puts protecting against a 10 percent
drop in November futures prices on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell to 25.76 percent at 3:45 p.m. from 26.61 percent
yesterday. Volatility for calls covering a 10 percent rise in
futures was little changed, at 23.62 percent from 23.76 percent
in the previous session.  Calls accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading volume
today. Three of the four most active options in electronic
trading were October $110, $112 and $120 calls. October options
expire Sept. 17.  “The market is leaning toward more upside risk again with
the failure to follow through on the downside and the
uncertainty over the talks about Syria,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .
“People are worried about a possible pop on the upside. They’re
not as confident these talks are going to go smoothly.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery
advanced $1.11, or 1 percent, to settle at $107.75 a barrel on
the Nymex. The front-month October contract gained $1.04 to
$108.60 a barrel.  Syria Talks  Futures rose as the diplomatic initiative by Russia has led
President  Barack Obama  to put off moves toward military strikes
on Syria even as he and other officials have said they are
uncertain whether the talks will be successful. Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad said the Obama administration must drop its
military threats and stop arming Syrian rebels.  October $110 calls rose 10 cents to 51 cents a barrel with
3,100 lots trading as of 3:06 p.m. October $112 calls climbed 1
cent to 16 cents a barrel on volume of 1,674 contracts.  On the Nymex floor, traders were buying March $90 puts,
Flynn said. The options slipped 28 cents to $2.03.  “In the front end of curve, they’re worried about this
thing blowing up and causing a spike in the price,” Flynn said.
“But they think the spike could be short-lived and, if it’s
not, it could kill demand.”  At-the-money volatility for November options, a measure of
expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, fell to 21.82
percent from 22.59 percent yesterday.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 52 percent of
the 122,010 lots traded.  October $115 calls were the most-active options yesterday
with 7,529 contracts changing hands as they lost 6 cents to 4
cents a barrel. January $85 puts, the next-most active, fell 12
cents to 57 cents on volume of 6,000 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
40,660 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 39,737 lots
and December $100 calls with 32,847.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
