Yuexiu Property Co. (123) , a real estate
developer controlled by the city government of Guangzhou, China,
said its unit’s joint venture bought land in Wuhan for 9.01
billion  yuan  ($1.5 billion).  Guangzhou City Construction & Development Group Nansha Co.,
95.5 percent-owned by Yuexiu, paid 20 percent of the 2 billion-yuan deposit for the site and will take an 8 percent stake in
the project company, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange
filing yesterday.  Yuexiu’s venture partner, Guangzhou Yuexiu Renda No. 4
Business Investment Enterprise LP, paid the balance of the
deposit and will own 92 percent of the project company, Yuexiu
said. Yuexiu’s parent owns a 49.7 percent stake in Yuexiu Renda,
according to the filing.  The venture can build 956,657 square meters (10.3 million
square feet) of residential and commercial floor area on the
147,240 square-meter site in Wuhan’s Jianghan district,
according to the filing and a separate e-mailed statement. Wuhan
is the capital of central China’s Hubei province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
