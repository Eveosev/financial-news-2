OPEC produced 0.8 percent less
crude oil in August due to declining Libyan output, even as
 Saudi Arabia  pumped the most in 32 years, the  International
Energy Agency  said.  The 12 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries produced 30.51 million barrels a day last month, the
Paris-based IEA said today in its monthly oil-market report.
This compares with an upwardly revised estimate for July of
30.77 million barrels.  Libya’s output fell to an average of 550,000 barrels in
August from 1 million barrels in July, according to the report.
Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, pumped 10.19 million
barrels a day, up 190,000 barrels from July, the IEA said.  “OPEC crude oil supplies turned lower again in August with
a sharp downturn in Libyan production only partially offset by
near-record output from Saudi Arabia,” the IEA said.  Iraqi crude production  rose to 3.17 million barrels a day
in August from a revised estimate of 3.06 million barrels in the
previous month, the IEA said. Total Iraqi exports rose about
165,000 barrels a day to 2.47 million barrels a day, “with
southern shipments exceptionally robust while northern volumes
remained constrained,” it said.  Forecast demand for OPEC crude in the third quarter of 2013
increased by 200,000 barrels a day on higher demand, to 30.3
million barrels a day, the IEA said. Demand in the fourth
quarter will slip to 29.6 million barrels as non-OPEC output
rises, according to the report. Demand for the full year is
unchanged from the IEA’s previous report at 29.9 million barrels
a day.  OPEC’s “effective” spare capacity was estimated at 2.94
million barrels a day in August, compared with 3.08 million
barrels in July, with Saudi Arabia holding over 75 percent of
the surplus, the IEA said.  OPEC supplies about 40 percent of the world’s crude and
comprises  Algeria ,  Angola ,  Ecuador , Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
