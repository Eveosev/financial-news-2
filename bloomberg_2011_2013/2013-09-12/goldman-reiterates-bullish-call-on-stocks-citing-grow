Stocks will continue to rally as
the bull market in equities moves into a new phase driven by
earnings growth rather than expanding valuations, according to
strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Equities will produce more moderate returns with lower
volatility in the second phase of the bull market, according to
Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman’s chief global equity strategist, who
reiterated his bullish stance on stocks. Oppenheimer said in a
March 2012 report that the prospects for returns from equities
versus bonds “are as good as they have been in a generation.”  Accommodative monetary policies from central banks have
helped extend the bull market in U.S. stocks into a fifth year.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has rallied 150 percent since
March 2009, driven by three rounds of bond purchases by the
Federal Reserve and better-than-forecast earnings by companies.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index has surged 96 percent in the same
period, while the MSCI World Index has climbed 123 percent.  “Eighteen months on, we continue to believe the case for
equities remains strong, albeit with returns likely to be more
muted in the months ahead,” London-based Oppenheimer wrote in a
report dated yesterday. “The driver from here is likely to be
earnings growth rather than valuation expansion from current
levels, consistent with the growth phase of the equity cycle.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
