A case of 2004 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, a Medoc first-growth wine estate, sold for 2,880
pounds ($4,550) on Liv-ex yesterday, approaching its highest
price since June and taking its gain this year to 11 percent.  The transaction was 1.8 percent up from a five-month low of
2,828 pounds a case at which it traded in mid-July. A second
case also sold on the market this week for 2,850 pounds.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, has risen 4 percent this year, with gains since mid-August following a price slide from its 2013 peak in March.
While a muted investor response to the Bordeaux 2012 sales
campaign sapped appetite for older vintages in recent months,
there are signs of revival following a summer lull.  “The market has settled down now,” said Peter Shakeshaft,
chief executive officer and founder of Redhill, U.K.-based Vin-X
Ltd., a wine investment company. First growths “can’t go lower,
in my opinion.”  Mouton ’04 is selling at quadruple the price of 700 pounds
a case at which it traded in September 2005, after its release
to the market, although 24 percent down from the record 3,780
pounds a case in May 2011, at the height of the  bull market  for
Bordeaux first-growths. A case sold for as much as $6,765 at an
 Acker Merrall & Condit  auction in  Hong Kong  in March 2011.  “Left-bank Bordeaux may be out of fashion, but it would
seem that brand Mouton continues to hold appeal for buyers,”
Liv-ex wrote in its market blog last month.  Cabernet Sauvignon  The 2004 Mouton ranks as the Pauillac estate’s third-cheapest wine of the past 10 years, ahead only of the 2007 and
2012, according to merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex  on its
Cellar Watch website.  Chateau Mouton-Rothschild has 84 hectares (208 acres)
planted with red-grape vines.  Cabernet Sauvignon  accounts for 83
percent of the vineyard, Merlot 14 percent and Cabernet Franc
the remaining 3 percent.  The average age of the vines is 44 years and they are
planted at a density of 10,000 per hectare on gravel. The wine
is fermented in oak vats for 15 to 25 days, and then matured for
as long as 22 months in barrels, according to Mouton-Rothschild’s  website .  The vineyard, owned by Baron Philippe de Rothschild SA, was
promoted in 1973 to the ranks of the top Bordeaux first-growth
estates on the left bank of the Gironde estuary, joining the
four other estates designated in the classification drawn up for
Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris Exhibition.  Mouton has been under the control of the Rothschild family
since being acquired by Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild in 1853.
The property was developed extensively by Baron Philippe, who
ran the estate from 1922 until his death in 1988, and since then
managed by his daughter Philippine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
