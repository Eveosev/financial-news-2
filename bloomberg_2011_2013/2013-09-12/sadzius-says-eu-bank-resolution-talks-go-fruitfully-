European Union finance chiefs will
tackle the European Commission’s plan to create an authority to
stabilize failing banks at a two-day meeting that starts
tomorrow, Lithuanian Finance Minister Rimantas Sadzius said.  “The discussions go quite fruitfully,” Sadzius told
reporters in Vilnius today. He said talks are coalescing around
the plan from EU financial services chief  Michel Barnier , which
calls for giving the commission new powers to close banks and
creating a 55 billion-euro ($73 billion) fund to cover the costs
of restructuring or shutting down troubled lenders.  Finance ministers gather in Vilnius to stake out positions
on Barnier’s plan, introduced in July. Lithuania, which holds
the 28-nation bloc’s rotating presidency, hopes to reach
agreement among nations by December so that talks can proceed
with the European Parliament in early 2014.  Joint resolution is the second element of an EU banking
union plan that will put the  European Central Bank  in charge of
bank supervision throughout the euro zone. The European
Parliament’s vote today to give final approval to ECB oversight
is “really a significant step,” Sadzius said.  Sadzius also said Lithuania still aims to join the single-currency zone in 2015.  “We really are keen to become a member of the euro club,”
Sadzius said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
