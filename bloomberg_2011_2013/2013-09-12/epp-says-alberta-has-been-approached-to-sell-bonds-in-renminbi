Alberta’s finance ministry has been
approached about selling renminbi-denominated bonds, according
to Lowell Epp, executive director of  capital markets  for
Alberta’s provincial government.  Epp, speaking at Bloomberg’s Canadian Fixed Income
Conference in New York, said the costs of issuing in the Chinese
currency would prohibit such a move, although the province is
considering modifying its global medium term note program to
allow  renminbi  sales.  “Alberta’s been approached and we’ve looked at it,” Epp
said. “At this point it doesn’t make any sense financially.
The spreads that we would issue at are much larger than we could
do domestically. We see it as a market to watch.”  Treasury officals from Quebec and Manitoba also said they
would consider selling renminbi-denominated debt when the price
is right.  “We’ve certainly been into  China  a couple of times looking
at investor-relations activities,” said John Clarkson,
Manitoba’s deputy finance minister. “The cost of bringing it
back into the Canadian dollar, whether it’s  interest rates 
they’re expecting themselves or the swap costs, it’s just not a
viable opportunity at the moment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
