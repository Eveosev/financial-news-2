Chancellor Angela Merkel  said it’s
worth fighting to keep  Europe  together because  Germany  can only
be successful if other countries in the region also do well.  “Europe is important for us because although we’re a big
country, in the world we’re little more than 1 percent” of the
population, Merkel said at an election rally of her  Christian
Democratic Union  in the western city of Koblenz today. “That’s
not enough to have a say internationally.”  Germany helps protect the euro because it ensures “jobs
and prosperity,” Merkel said. Still, solidarity from Germany,
Europe’s biggest economy, is always tied to conditions so that
recipients of aid can help themselves, the chancellor said.  Merkel’s resolve to avert a collapse of the euro region
during the sovereign debt crisis without sacrificing German
interests resonates with voters before the Sept. 22 federal
election. While her Social Democratic challenger,  Peer Steinbrueck , says Merkel’s course has divided Europe, support
for her coalition with the Free Democratic Party held at 45
percent in a weekly Forsa poll yesterday, probably enough for a
repeat of her present alliance if replicated on Election Day.  Merkel, speaking on Koblenz, said that Germany was the sick
man of Europe 10 years ago and the country only returned to
health after carrying out reforms. She reiterated that joint
bond sales by euro-region members would be wrong as every
country has to make its own contribution.  To contact the reporters on this story:
