Canada  is on track to balance its
budget by the fiscal year starting April 2015, a Department of
Finance official said.  The federal government may post a small surplus that year
as projected in the government’s March budget, Associate Deputy
Finance Minister Jean Boivin said today at the Bloomberg
Canadian fixed-income conference in  New York .  Canada remains vulnerable to external shocks and the
country has made progress pursuing reforms to its financial
system, Boivin said.  While high levels of  household debt  remain a key risk to
the country’s economy, consumer credit growth has been slowing,
Boivin said. “If you look over the last year, the evolution has
been more constructive.”  The tapering of stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve would
be positive for Canada, as it would happen amid strong growth in
the U.S. economy, the destination of about three-quarters of
Canada’s exports, Boivin said.  Canada’s jobless rate will average 7 percent next year,
according to a Bloomberg News economist survey with 15
responses, exceeding the rate in the U.S. for the first time in
five years and eliminating an advantage touted by policy makers
as evidence of the country’s stronger economy.  A separate survey about the  U.S. economy  forecasts a 6.9
percent jobless rate next year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
