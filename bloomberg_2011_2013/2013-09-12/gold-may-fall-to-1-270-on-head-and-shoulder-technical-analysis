Gold may extend its 19 percent
slump since January as prices on charts form a “head and
shoulder” pattern that signals more selling, according to
Credit Suisse Group AG.  Bullion fell below $1,360 an ounce, a support level from
the upward trend that began in late June,  David Sneddon  and
Christopher Hine, technical analysts at the bank, said in a
report yesterday. The drop may lead to the formation of a small
head-and-shoulder top, they wrote. The pattern comprises three
consecutive peaks on a chart, with the middle being the highest.  Prices may slip further to test $1,337, the 38.2 percent
retracement of the June-August rally on Fibonacci analysis,
according to the report. A fall below the level “should add
weight to the scenario” that a broader bear trend is resuming,
taking the metal lower to $1,270, they wrote.  Gold tumbled into a  bear market  in April on concern that
the  Federal Reserve  would pare stimulus as the economy improved.
Metal for immediate delivery dropped 0.6 percent to $1,357.45 an
ounce at 2:53 p.m. in Beijing.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts use charts of
trading patterns and prices to predict changes. Fibonacci
studies are based on the theory that prices rise or fall by
certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
