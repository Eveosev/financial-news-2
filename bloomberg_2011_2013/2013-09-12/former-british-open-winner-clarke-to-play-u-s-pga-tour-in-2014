Darren Clarke  will take advantage
of the exemption for winning the 2011 British Open to play on
the U.S.  PGA Tour  next year.  Clarke earned a five-year exemption to play in the U.S. for
his Open victory at Royal St. George’s two years ago.  “I will be taking up my U.S. PGA Tour card next season,
but that does not mean I am abandoning Europe,” the 45-year-old
Northern Irishman said in a  statement  released by his management
company, IMG. “I will be supporting my home tour as usual. I
still feel I can be competitive at the highest level, I have
always enjoyed America and the U.S. Tour in the past and I am
looking forward to playing there more often again.”  Clarke has one victory and one other top-10 finish between
the two tours since capturing his first major title at the age
of 42. He finished 108th on the European Tour’s money list last
season and is 127th this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
