The maker of  London ’s iconic black
cabs restarted production today, seven months after Zhejiang
Geely Holding Group Co. rescued it from administration.  “The company has once again commenced the building of new
TX4 models in its production line,” Geely said in a statement.  Geely, which plans to invest 150 million pounds ($237
million) in the London Taxi Company in the next five years, said
today it resumed production following “significant
improvements” to the manufacturing plant in Coventry,  England .  Geely in February bought Manganese Bronze Holdings Plc for
11.04 million pounds on a debt-free basis. The purchase will
help the closely held automaker headed by Li Shufu speed up its
expansion following the purchase of Volvo Cars in Sweden.  Geely plans to develop new models to follow the current
TX4. The unit has now a total workforce of 170 people and its
 production line  will make about 50 taxis per week, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
