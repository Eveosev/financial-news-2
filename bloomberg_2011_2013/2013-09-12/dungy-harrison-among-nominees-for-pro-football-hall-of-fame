Coach  Tony Dungy  and wide receiver
Marvin Harrison, who won the Super Bowl after the 2006 National
Football League season with the  Indianapolis Colts , are among 16
first-year eligible nominees for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  There are 126 candidates for the 2014 class -- 89 players,
16 coaches and 21 contributors. The group will be trimmed to 25
in November and 15 finalists in January. Between four and seven
inductees will be selected on Feb. 1, the day before the Super
Bowl at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the Pro
Football Hall of Fame said in a news release last night.  Dungy became the first black coach to win a Super Bowl
title when he guided the Colts to a 29-17 victory against the
 Chicago Bears  in the title game after the 2006 season. Dungy,
57, retired in 2008 after 31 years as a coach and player in the
NFL with a career coaching record of 148-78.  Harrison spent his entire playing career at the Colts, from
1996 to 2008. He caught 965 passes after  Peyton Manning  took
over as quarterback in 1998 and ended with 1,102 catches for
third on the career list in receptions and eighth in yards
receiving with 14,580.  Three-time All-Pro Harrison had an NFL-record 143 catches
in 2002 and totaled at least 100 catches in four straight
seasons, from 1999-02.  Linebacker Derrick Brooks, 40, is also on the list of
nominees for the first time. Brooks was picked in the first
round of the 1995 draft by the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers , where he
remained for 14 seasons until his retirement in 2008. He played
under Dungy until the coach was fired by Tampa Bay in 2002 after
six seasons.  More Nominees  Brooks was a member of Tampa Bay’s Super Bowl-winning team
after the 2002 season and was a five-time All-Pro and a member
of the NFL’s 2000s All-Decade Team.  Also among the nominees is Andre Reed, a seven-time
finalist in Hall of Fame voting who was a member of the Buffalo
Bills teams that lost four straight  Super Bowls  from 1990 to
1993.  Michael Strahan,  Jerome Bettis ,  Tim Brown , Will Shields,
Charles Haley, Kevin Greene, Aeneas Williams and contributor
Edward DeBartolo are other candidates who were finalists in
2013.  Other first-time candidates for induction are quarterback
Trent Green; running backs Shaun Alexander and Warrick Dunn;
linebackers Tedy Bruschi, Willie McGinest and Zach Thomas;
defensive backs Rodney Harrison, Sam Madison and Patrick Surtain; offensive linemen Willie Anderson and Walter Jones, and
coaches  Jon Gruden  and Mike Holmgren.  To contact the reporter on this story:
