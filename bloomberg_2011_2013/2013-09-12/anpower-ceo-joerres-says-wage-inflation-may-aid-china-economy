Manpower Chief Executive Officer
Jeffrey Joerres comments on wage inflation in China and the jobs
market in  Taiwan . Joerres spoke in an interview today in the
Chinese city of Dalian, where he’s attending a conference
organized by the  World Economic Forum .  On wage inflation in China:  “A lot of the  China GDP (CNGDPYOY)  is coming from internally, instead
of just the stimulus growth, big infrastructure growth, which is
really a nice turn for China.”  China’s labor law is “going to be driving a lot of wage
inflation, which in many ways is good for the Chinese economy at
this point, because you need to have internal demand.”  “Really it is the internal story, over the next six to
nine months, our belief is you are going to see more of an
internal consumption story which will really assist China.”  On Taiwan’s jobs market:  “Taiwan is definitely a tech story. It just keeps going.
What we are seeing is more and more, loads of tech.”  “They are really starting to come on in a big momentum,
and that market then is being kind of drained if you will, so
there’s a talent shortage in Taiwan.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
