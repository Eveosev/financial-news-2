Argentina  will tap a record $9.86
billion of central bank  reserves  next year to make payments on
its foreign debt, according to the 2014 budget bill presented to
Congress today.  South America ’s second-biggest  economy  will expand 6.2
percent in 2014 after growing 5.1 percent this year, Economy
Minister Hernan Lorenzino told lawmakers. Annual inflation will
slow to 9.9 percent in December of next year from 10.5 percent
this year, according to estimates included in the bill.  “We Argentines must keep working for the continuity of
this project which has focused on employment, enabling the most
important historic cycle in the past years of growth combined
with social inclusion,” Lorenzino said.  Since 2010, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s
government, which has avoided borrowing internationally at rates
that would be the highest among  emerging markets , has drained
reserves to pay foreign-currency obligations.  Reserves have fallen 23 percent to $36.58 billion since
March 2010, when Fernandez decreed the use of central bank funds
to pay debt. Since then, the government has used $39 billion of
reserves for that purpose, Lorenzino said today.  Argentine government dollar-denominated bonds yield an
average 13.66 percent, more than double the 6.33 percent average
for emerging-market peers, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
EMBI Global Diversified Index.  Tax revenue will increase 27 percent while spending will
rise by 19 percent in 2014 from this year, enabling the
government to obtain a budget surplus of 0.11 percent of gross
domestic product, compared with a deficit of 1.77 percent of GDP
this year, according to the budget bill.  Exports Increase  The world’s largest exporter of  soybean oil  expects the
2014  trade surplus  to narrow to $10.1 billion from $10.6 billion
this year, according to the bill.  The peso will have an average value of 6.33 pesos per
dollar in 2014, compared with 5.72 pesos per dollar today,
according to the budget proposal.  Since former President  Nestor Kirchner  replaced staff at
the national statistics institute, known as Indec, in 2007,
Argentina has under-reported inflation, according to private
economists and the  International Monetary Fund .  In the 12 months to the end of August consumer prices rose
10.6 percent, according to the institute, while a report
compiled by opposition lawmakers using statistics provided by
private economists put the increase at 25.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
