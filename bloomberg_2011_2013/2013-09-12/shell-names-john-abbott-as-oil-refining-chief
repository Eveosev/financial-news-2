Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
largest oil company, named John Abbott as refining director to
succeed Ben van Beurden, who will become chief executive officer
in January.  Abbott, a 30-year industry veteran, has been running about
30 refineries and petrochemical plants at the company, The
Hague-based Shell said today in a statement. He will leave his
current post of executive vice president for manufacturing on
Oct. 1 and will also join Shell’s executive committee.  Abbott, a British national, joined the company in 1981
after graduating from Birmingham University in central England.
He had several jobs running refineries, petrochemical plants and
heavy-crude production projects from North America to Asia.  In  Canada , Abbott supervised Shell’s oil-sands ventures,
facing environmental protests, and managed an associated carbon-capture and storage project. He has been in charge of the
company’s investment program to raise heavy-oil output by 60
percent in the decade to 2020 by upgrading assets in  North
America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
