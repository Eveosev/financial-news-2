Primark, the budget fashion chain
owned by  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF) , will pay all victims of
the collapsed Rana Plaza factory in  Bangladesh  more short-term
financial aid and criticized competitors for not attending talks
on compensation for the workers in Geneva today.  “The company notes that only nine brands attended the
Geneva meeting,” Primark said in an e-mailed statement. “There
were some 28 brands being supplied by factories in the Rana
Plaza building.”  Representatives of retailers, labor unions and non-governmental organizations met in the Swiss city over the past
two days to discuss compensation for those killed or injured in
two factory disasters in Bangladesh. Today’s talks centered on
this year’s collapse of the Rana Plaza factory, which killed
more than 1,000 people in the nation’s worst industrial
accident.  Primark will pay aid to all the factory’s workers and their
families for three months, declining to disclose the amount.
That follows earlier payments and food aid of about $1 million
to victims and their families. The company has registered the
details of 3,333 workers as part of the program, the statement
said.  Earlier today C&A Group said it had allocated 1 million
euros ($1.3 million) in total to support the long-term needs of
victims of a fire at the Tazreen plant, an earlier industrial
incident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
