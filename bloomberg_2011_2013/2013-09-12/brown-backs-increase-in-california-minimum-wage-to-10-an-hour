California ’s  minimum wage  would
increase 25 percent to $10 an hour under amended legislation
that Governor  Jerry Brown  announced he would sign over the
objections of business groups.  The bill would raise the basic minimum rate, now $8 an
hour, to $9 in July 2014 and $10 in January 2016. The proposal
passed the Assembly in May and is awaiting a vote in the Senate.
Both chambers are controlled by Brown’s fellow Democrats.  “The minimum wage has not kept pace with rising costs,”
Brown said yesterday in a statement. “This legislation is
overdue and will help families that are struggling in this harsh
economy.”  California last boosted the minimum wage in 2008, when
Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor. Business groups,
such as the California Chamber of Commerce, have said the bill
would stifle job growth. Only eight U.S. states, including
California, pay $8 per hour or more.  The original bill included automatic future increases based
on cost of living and would have reached $10 in 2018. The Senate
has until tomorrow to pass the legislation.  Congress last voted to raise the federal minimum wage in
2007 and President  Barack Obama ’s call to raise it to $9 an hour
from $7.25 has gone nowhere with lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
