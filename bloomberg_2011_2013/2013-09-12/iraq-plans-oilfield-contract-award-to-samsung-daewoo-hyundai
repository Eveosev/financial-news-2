Iraq  plans to award contracts to
Samsung Engineering,  Hyundai Heavy Industries (009540)  and Daewoo
Engineering & Construction for works on Zubair, one of its
largest oil fields, Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said.  “We are in the last stages in attributing the project
entirely to three Korean companies,” Luaibi said at the signing
ceremony for a memorandum of understanding on energy cooperation
with South Korean Energy Minister Yoon Sang Jick in Seoul today.
“This matter will be completed in less than two weeks.”  The Zubair project will cost more than $3 billion, he said,
without indicating whether it was the sum that the three
companies would get, or how much each would receive.  Hyundai Heavy and  Samsung Engineering (028050)  have each submitted
bids for the Zubair project, according to officials at the
companies. A Daewoo Engineering spokesman declined to comment
other than to say the company hopes to win more orders in Iraq
later this year, according to an e-mailed response to questions.  Eni Spa (ENI)  is leading the group that won the tender to develop
the oil field, located near the southern city of Basrah, with
the participation of  Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY) , Korea Gas Corp.
and Missan Oil. Eni said in July it’s targeting a plateau
production of 850,000 barrels a day for Zubair.  To contact the reporters on this story:
