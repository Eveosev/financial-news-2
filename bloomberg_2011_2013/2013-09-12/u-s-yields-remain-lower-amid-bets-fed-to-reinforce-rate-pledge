Treasuries rose, pushing yields
lower for a second day, as investors weighed prospects for
Federal Reserve stimulus at a meeting next week and economic
data from  Europe  and  Japan  damped growth optimism.  Ten-year  yields  slid to a one-week low after rising last
week to the highest since July 2011 on concern the Fed may slow
purchases. The surge reversed after data on Sept. 6 showed
lower-than-forecast job gains in August.  Thirty-year (USGG30YR)  bond yields
reached a one-week low before the U.S. sells $13 billion of the
debt today. Euro-area industrial production shrank more than
forecast in July and Japanese machinery orders stagnated.  “The rise in yields was based on whatever tapering the Fed
is going to do -- people feel we’ve priced that into the
market,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in  New York 
at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “These are levels to buy
rather than to sell.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.87 percent at 12:11 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 2.86
percent, the least since Sept. 4. The price of the 2.5 percent
security due in August 2023 gained 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000
face amount, to 96 26/32.  Thirty-year bond yields dropped four basis points to 3.81
percent, the lowest level since Sept. 5.  Bond Auction  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 3.82 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 3.652 percent on Aug. 8 at
the last sale. Investors  bid  for 2.11 times the amount of debt
offered last month, the least in two years.  Long bonds auctioned in July drew a yield of 3.660 percent,
the highest since August 2011.  Treasuries rallied yesterday as the government’s $21
billion auction of 10-year notes drew  bids  valued at 2.86 times
the amount offered, the most since March. The  yield  at the sale
was the highest since June 2011.  The government said it will auction $13 billion in 10-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on Sept. 19. It sold $15
billion of the 10-year debt on July 18 at a high yield of 0.384
percent, the first positive yield for the securities since
November 2011.  Treasuries also rose yesterday on bets that  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) ’s record $49 billion bond sale would lead to
the unwinding of hedges used to guard against higher yields. As
companies sell debt, they enter into rate-lock agreements, in
which they bet on Treasury prices falling to guard against
higher yields. Once the debt is sold, they end the wagers.  ‘Very Deep’  The Verizon sale “was positive in that it shows that the
market remains very deep,” said  Michael Leister , a senior rates
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London . “That they were able to
place such a huge amount without a major hiccup is a positive
sign of the market’s absorption capacity,” he said.  Ten-year note yields will end the year at 2.85 percent and
increase to 3.1 percent by June 2014, according to the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey released
today.  U.S. government bonds have lost 0.5 percent since the end
of August, set for a fifth monthly decline, the longest since a
seven-month slump ended March 2011, according to the  Bloomberg
U.S. Treasury Bond Index. (BUSY)   The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares has  returned 
3.5 percent this month, including reinvested dividends.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will decide at its Sept.
17-18 meeting to reduce monthly purchases of Treasuries to $35
billion from $45 billion, according to the median of 34
responses in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Policy makers
will maintain mortgage-bond buying at  $40 billion  under the
central bank’s quantitative-easing program, the survey shows.  Fed Purchase  The Fed bought $3.36 billion today of Treasuries due from
August 2021 to August 2023 as part of the stimulus program.  The central bank has maintained the benchmark  federal-funds
rate  target at a record-low range of zero to 0.25 percent since
December 2008. It  forecast  in June that the  unemployment rate 
may fall to as low as 6.5 percent next year, from  7.3 percent  in
August. Inflation, as measured by the  price index  for personal
consumption expenditures, may advance to 2 percent in 2014 from
1.4 percent in July, according to the central bank’s
projections.  Yields briefly  cut  their decline today after initial claims
for  unemployment benefits  in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped to
the lowest level since April 2006 as two states upgraded
computer systems.  Upgrades’ Role  Claims  fell  by 31,000 to 292,000 in the week ended Sept. 7,
which also included the Labor Day holiday, according to Labor
Department data released today in  Washington . The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for an increase to 330,000
applications. An agency spokesman said that the computer
upgrades played a major role in the drop in claims.  Factory production in the euro region fell 1.5 percent from
June, when it gained 0.6 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office said today. That’s more than the 0.3 percent
contraction forecast by economists, according to the median of
33 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Japanese machinery orders were unchanged in July from the
previous month when they fell 2.7 percent, the Cabinet Office
said in  Tokyo . Economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted an
increase of 2.4 percent.  A report tomorrow is forecast to show U.S. retail sales
rose 0.5 percent in August, up from 0.2 percent the previous
month. Sales growth has averaged 0.34 percent a month this year.  “We had IP numbers that were not so pleasant out of
Europe,” said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research at FTN
Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee . “Now we have to wait for
Europe a little bit, and that makes tomorrow’s retail numbers
very important as well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
