U.K. government bonds climbed as
Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  told lawmakers the central
bank has no plan to raise  interest rates  until unemployment
drops further.  Ten-year gilts rose for a second day even after the Debt
Management Office sold 3.75 billion pounds ($5.92 billion) of
the debt at the highest yield since June 2011. The central bank
introduced guidance on the future path of interest rates last
month and said it won’t raise them until joblessness falls to 7
percent, a scenario it said may not happen until late 2016. Data
yesterday showed the  jobless rate  dropped to 7.7 percent in the
three months to July. The pound was little changed.  “The gilt market has already priced in a lot in terms of
economic recovery and rate outlook, and there is nothing that
Carney said today to suggest the Monetary Policy Committee will
tighten policy earlier than expected by the market,” said Robin Marshall, director of fixed income at Smith & Williamson
Investment Management in  London . “If anything, the risk is that
we get disappointment on data because everyone is now expecting
a strong recovery. Gilts should be well-supported.”  The 10-year yield dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.94 percent at 4:29 p.m. London time. The
rate climbed to 3.05 percent yesterday, the  highest  since July
2011. The 2.25 percent bond maturing in September 2023 rose
0.53, or 5.30 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.07. The
two-year yield declined two basis points to 0.49 percent.  Gilts Sale  Gilts rose alongside German bonds after  Italy ’s three-year
borrowing costs climbed to the highest since October at an
auction. Speculation that a vote on whether to expel former
premier  Silvio Berlusconi  from the Senate will destabilize the
coalition government also weighed on Italian debt.  The recent increase in U.K. bond yields to 3 percent may be
excessive and the rates may drop from here, according to HSBC
Holdings Plc.  “My inclination is to think that 3 percent would already
be too high,”  Steven Major , global head of fixed-income
Research at HSBC in London, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “The Pulse” with  Guy Johnson . “In a year’s time
we could be back down at 2 percent.”  The Debt Management Office sold the 10-year gilt at an
average yield of 2.976 percent. The U.K. last sold 10-year
securities on July 2 at 2.584 percent.  No Tightening  “Until we see unemployment fall to 7 percent, we will not
begin to consider tightening monetary policy,” Carney told
parliament’s Treasury committee. “It’s not about time but about
conditions. It’s about jobs and income growing. At that stage,
we would sit down and assess policy.”  Gilts lost 5.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes, underperforming
German securities, which dropped 2.9 percent, and a 3.8 percent
decline in Treasuries.  Sterling held a four-day advance versus the dollar after
Carney reiterated the Bank of England’s policy of keeping the
benchmark Bank rate low until the  unemployment rate  declined to
7 percent. Longer-dated bond yields are rising because of the
economic recovery and speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will
soon taper its bond purchases, he said.  “Carney appears to be comfortable with the rise in long-term rates,” said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank International in London. “He didn’t use this
opportunity to push back aggressively against recent moves in
market rates.”  The U.K. currency bought $1.5819 after reaching $1.5840,
the highest since Feb. 8. Sterling was at 84.16 pence per euro
after appreciating to 83.83 pence yesterday, the strongest level
since Jan. 23.  The implied yield on the short-sterling contract expiring
in December 2014 is 0.93 percent, up from 0.68 percent on Aug.
1. The implied rate on the September 2016 contract has climbed
to 2.40 percent from 1.60 percent in that period.  The pound has appreciated 7.7 percent in the past six
months, the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 0.8 percent and the euro advanced 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
