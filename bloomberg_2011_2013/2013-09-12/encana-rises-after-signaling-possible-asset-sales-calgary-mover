Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s largest
natural gas producer, rose the most in three months after
signaling potential asset sales in a strategy update.  Encana gained as much as 4.9 percent, the steepest intraday
increase since May 20, and was up 4.1 percent at C$18.66 at
11:57 a.m. in Toronto.  “Encana has more inventory in its portfolio of plays,
particularly dry natural gas, than can be optimally developed,”
the Calgary-based company said today in a statement.  The company focused on developing oil and petroleum liquids
after North American gas prices fell to a decade-low last year.
Chief Executive Officer  Doug Suttles  will give an update on the
company’s new strategy at a conference in  New York  today,
according to today’s statement.  “A press release wakes people up” to Encana’s
restructuring to become a larger producer of higher-priced
liquids, Dirk Lever, an analyst at Altacorp Capital Inc. in
Calgary, said in a phone interview today. “It’s under-owned by
institutions and it doesn’t take much to move this stock.”  Greg Pardy, an analyst with Royal Bank of Canada, changed
his recommendation on Encana to the equivalent of a buy today.
Encana is ahead of its target to change its strategy by the end
of the year, Pardy said in a note to clients. The stock has
eight buy, 12 hold and six sell  recommendations  from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
