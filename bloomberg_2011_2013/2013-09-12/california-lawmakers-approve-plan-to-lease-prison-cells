California  Governor  Jerry Brown  won
approval of his plan to spend more than $1 billion to rent
thousands of prison cells owned by  Corrections Corp. of America 
 prison  and  Geo Group Inc. (GEO)  to temporarily meet a federal court
deadline to reduce overcrowding.  The legislation, approved yesterday by both chambers of the
legislature, calls for $315 million in the fiscal year that ends
June 30 and about $415 million for each of the following two
years to lease a Corrections Corp. prison in the  Mojave Desert ,
ship inmates to commercial lockups out of state, and rent beds
at public and private jails in California.  California faces a Dec. 31 deadline to remove about 10,000
inmates from state penitentiaries to reduce their population to
137.5 percent of designed capacity. Last month, the U.S. Supreme
Court rejected Brown’s plea for a postponement. The plan avoids
the possibility of releasing thousands of felons.  “This bill is a compromise,” Senate Republican leader Bob Huff of Diamond Bar said yesterday prior to the vote. “It’s not
perfect.”  Passage came after Brown reached a deal with fellow
Democrats in the Senate. Under it, the state would again ask the
court for more time to meet the order. Any money saved would pay
for expanding mental-health and drug rehabilitation programs to
help keep ex-convicts from returning, while preparing to move
inmates into private prisons and other facilities if the court
refuses.  Over Capacity  California’s prison system, which operated at 200 percent
of designed capacity for more than a decade, was at 143.8
percent as of Sept. 4, with 123,777 inmates, according to a
Corrections and Rehabilitation Department  report .  Federal judges seized control of the prison health system
in 2006, saying inmate care was so bad it amounted to cruel and
unusual punishment and violated the U.S. Constitution. That led
to the order to reduce inmate numbers.  With the money, California would put 1,000 inmates, with
state guards, in Nashville-based Corrections Corp.’s 2,300-bed
prison in the  Mojave Desert . The company currently rents some of
the space to the U.S. Marshals Service and U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement.  California would shelve plans to bring back about 4,000 of
the almost 9,000 inmates held in out-of-state Corrections Corp.
prisons and instead ship out as many as 5,800 more. The state
currently pays Corrections Corp. about $64.50 a day per inmate.  The state also would lease as many as 1,225 beds in two of
 Boca Raton , Florida-based Geo’s facilities in California that
were shuttered when the state canceled earlier contracts.  Corrections Corp. closed yesterday at $33.72 in  New York ,
up 2 percent, the most since Aug. 20. The stock has gained 11
percent in the past year. Geo fell 0.3 percent to $31.92. The
shares are up 33 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
