Hopes of a Pink Floyd reunion, an Amy Winehouse tribute, Simon Callow and Anna Chancellor are our choices for London this week.  STAGE  There’s just a week left to see a famous love-hate relationship reenacted on the London stage.  In Noel Coward’s “Private  Lives ,” Anna Chancellor and Toby Stephens play the divorced couple who can’t seem to get enough of each other, though they’ve both remarried. There’s a lot of squabbling and smashed china in this fun Jonathan Kent staging, together with some beautiful Art Nouveau sets.  “Private Lives” is at the Gielgud Theatre through Sept. 21:  http://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk  or call +44-844-482-5138.  DINING  Pont Street is the new restaurant of television chef  Sophie Michell , best known for “ Cook Yourself Thin .” The establishment, on the site of the short-lived Hix Belgravia, specializes in seafood. Michell is the youngest female executive chef in the U.K. Information:  http://bit.ly/1eH5YwW  or +44-20-3189-4850.  Gymkhana, which opened this week in Mayfair, is a modern interpretation of the sports clubs created by the British in colonial  India . It’s an offshoot of Trishna, the Michelin-starred Indian seafood restaurant in Marylebone. Information:  http://www.gymkhanalondon.com/  or +44-20-3011-5900.  VISUAL ARTS  He was  Sudan ’s undersecretary for culture in the mid-1970s, then spent six months and eight days in prison without charge.  Now 83, artist Ibrahim El-Salahi is the toast of  Tate Modern  -- and the first African artist to get a retrospective there. The 100 works on show blend calligraphy and geometric motifs with Modernism and Surrealism, highlighting the many long years that El-Salahi has spent living in the West.  The exhibition ends Sept. 22 at Tate Modern. Information:  http://www.tate.org.uk  or +44-20-7887-8888.  MUSIC  Pink Floyd fans will be hoping for a reunion of sorts as Roger Waters plays “The Wall” at Wembley Stadium Saturday. His former band mates David Gilmour and Nick Mason have joined on previous  London  dates. With or without his colleagues, the 70-year-old puts on one of rock’s more spectacular shows, with a flying pig and the destruction of an enormous wall.  Leonard Cohen needs no props and brings his understated show to the 02 Sunday with excellent songs such as “Suzanne.”  http://www.roger-waters.com ,  http://www.leonardcohen.com   A monthlong festival, “Amy 30,” is marking what would have been the 30th birthday of singer Amy Winehouse on Sept. 14. There are concerts, exhibitions, a cabaret and a walking tour in Camden:  http://www.amywinehousefoundation.org/amys30appeal   OTHER LONDON OUTINGS  A tentacular contraption has landed outside Tate Modern.  It’s “Endless Stair” -- an installation of 20 interlocking hardwood staircases that you can use as a climbing frame. It’s a key attraction in the eight-day London Design Festival (through Sept. 22), centered around the Victoria & Albert Museum. Information:  http://www.londondesignfestival.com .
