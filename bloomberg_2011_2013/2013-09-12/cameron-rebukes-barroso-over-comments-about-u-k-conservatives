U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
rebuked European Commission President  Jose Barroso  over comments
he made about the electoral prospects of the British
Conservative Party.  Barroso yesterday told Martin Callanan, a U.K. Tory member
of the European Parliament and head of its Conservatives and
Reformists group, that he faced the threat of defeat at the
hands of the U.K. Independence Party.  The comments followed Cameron’s decision this year to open
the door to a possible U.K. departure from the EU. In January,
seeking to stave off growing anti-EU voices within his party,
Cameron promised to win back powers from European institutions
and put continued membership in the bloc to a popular vote.  “The Barroso thing did annoy me because frankly, his job
is to serve the members of the EU, and the British Conservatives
in the European Parliament are an important party,” Cameron
told LBC Radio today. “They are the governing party of the
 United Kingdom  and he should be respecting their views rather
than trying to lecture them. I’ll tell him that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
