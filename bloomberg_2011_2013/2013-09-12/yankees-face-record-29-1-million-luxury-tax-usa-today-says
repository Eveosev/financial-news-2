The New York Yankees will pay a
record $29.1 million luxury tax on their $236.2 million payroll,
 USA Today  reported, citing salary figures it obtained.  Repeat violators of the luxury tax limit pay a 50 percent
tax for salaries in excess of the $178 million threshold this
year, the newspaper said, citing the collective bargaining
agreement.  The  Los Angeles Dodgers , the only other Major League
Baseball team to be assessed a luxury tax this year, will pay
$9.9 million on their franchise-record $234.5 million payroll,
USA Today reported. Their  tax rate  is 17.5 percent for a first
offense.  The Dodgers join the Yankees as the only teams to have been
penalized for an excessive payroll since the tax was implemented
10 years ago, the newspaper reported. The Yankees have paid
$224.2 million in taxes so far, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
