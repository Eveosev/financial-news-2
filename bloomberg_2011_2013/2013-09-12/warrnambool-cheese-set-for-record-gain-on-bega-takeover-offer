Warrnambool (WCB)  Cheese & Butter Factory
Co. headed for its biggest advance on record after a takeover
bid from  Bega Cheese Ltd. (BGA)  that valued the target at A$319
million ($295 million).  Shares surged as much as 33 percent to a record A$6 in
Sydney trading, and traded at A$5.90 by 2:08 p.m, set for the
biggest gain since the company was listed in 2004. The  stock  has
climbed 64 percent this year, compared with a 13 percent advance
in the S&P/ASX 200 Index.  Bega will offer 1.2 shares and A$2 cash for each
Warrnambool share, valuing the stock at A$5.78 a piece, the
company said in a statement today. The offer is a 28 percent
premium to yesterday’s closing price. Bega said it owns 18
percent of Warrnambool Cheese.  The merged company would produce 353,000 tons of dairy
products and process about 1.6 billion liters of milk from
Australian farmers, Bega Executive Chairman Barry Irvin said in
a statement.  Australia ’s milk production totaled 9.2 billion
liters in the 2012-2013 season, according to Dairy Australia.  Warrnambool said in a statement that it hasn’t had the
opportunity to review the offer and isn’t yet in a position to
make a formal recommendation to shareholders. The company’s
directors will meet shortly to consider the bid, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
