Canada’s new home price  index  rose
0.2 percent in July, led by gains in Toronto and Calgary, the
government statistics agency said.  Prices in Toronto, the country’s largest city, increased
0.3 percent from the previous month, while Calgary gained 0.6
percent and  Vancouver  rose 0.2 percent, Statistics Canada said
today in Ottawa.  Economists forecast the index would rise 0.1 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey with nine
responses. From a year earlier, new  home prices  increased 1.9
percent in July.  Canada’s housing market has been showing conflicting signs
of strength. While municipalities issued a record amount of
 building permits  in July,  housing starts  slowed in August by
more than forecast. Policy makers have tightened mortgage rules
amid signs of overbuilding in places such as Toronto and
Vancouver.  In a separate report,  Statistics Canada  said the country’s
net foreign debt declined C$122.4 billion ($118.6 billion) in
the second quarter to C$103.7 billion, the lowest since 2007, as
the value of Canadian stocks fell and a weaker currency
increased the value of foreign assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
