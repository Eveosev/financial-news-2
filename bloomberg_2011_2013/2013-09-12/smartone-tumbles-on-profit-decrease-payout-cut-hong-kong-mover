SmarTone Telecommunications
Holdings Ltd. (315) , a unit of  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) , fell the
most in almost two years in Hong Kong trading after the company
posted an earnings decline and announced dividend cut.  Shares of the telecom service provider slumped as much as
16 percent, the biggest drop since September 22, 2011, with a
trading volume more than 10 times the three-month average. The
benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 0.3 percent.  Smartone’s net income for the year ended June 30 plunged 18
percent to HK$843 million, the first decrease since 2009. The
company, one of the authorized mobile carriers for  Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) 
iPhone in Hong Kong, will cut its dividend ratio to 60 percent
of net income in the future because of regulatory and market
uncertainties, it said in a  statement  yesterday.  The cut “definitely makes those who like the company
because of the generous dividend payout upset,” said Victor Yip, analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., who downgraded the stock to
sell from buy today. “For people who like the company because
of the growth story, they know that at least in the next 12
months, the earnings are not likely to show a positive growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
