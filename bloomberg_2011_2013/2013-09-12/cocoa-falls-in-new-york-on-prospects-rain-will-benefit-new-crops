Cocoa fell for the first time in
three days in  New York  on prospects rain will help crops in West
Africa, the biggest producing region.  A small rainy season usually in September in  Ivory Coast 
and  Ghana  has started in central and northern growing areas,
according to Macquarie Group Ltd. Harvests usually start next
month. Speculation that dry weather would damage the new crops
boosted prices yesterday to the highest level in almost a year.  “It’s raining a little bit,” said  Kona Haque , an analyst
at Macquarie in London. “Southern areas are going to be missed,
which is a major cocoa producing belt.”  Cocoa for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to $2,566 a

contract since Sept. 17. In London, cocoa for December delivery
dropped 0.1 percent to 1,683 pounds ($2,658) a ton.  Sugar futures in New York fell for the first time in a
week.  Prices climbed 7.7 percent since Sept. 4 through
