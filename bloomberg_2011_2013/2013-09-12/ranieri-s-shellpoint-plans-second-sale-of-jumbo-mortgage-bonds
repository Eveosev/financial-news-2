Shellpoint Partners LLC , the lender
backed by mortgage-bond pioneer Lewis Ranieri, is planning its
second sale of home-loan securities without government backing
after restructuring its initial transaction and offering higher
relative yields to attract investors.  The latest deal is backed by $308.6 million of prime jumbo
loans, representing a pool with “substantial borrower equity in
each mortgaged property,” Kroll Bond Rating Agency said today
in an e-mailed statement accompanying its pre-sale report.  Shellpoint’s $251 million offering in June came after
credit markets were roiled by mounting expectations the  Federal
Reserve  will scale back its $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases, and growing issuance of debt known as non-agency
mortgage securities that challenged demand.  The largest portion, a $158.8 million top-rated slice,
provided protection against losses of 20 percent on the
underlying loans, up from 10 percent in the initial terms. The
debt was sold at a spread of 2.85 percentage points, up from the
2.45 percentage points offered earlier on top-rated notes.  In Shellpoint’s latest deal, Kroll said it expects to grant
AAA ratings to $285.3 million of notes with credit enhancement
of 7.9 percent. About 1.2 percent of the underlying loans are to
foreign nationals with no credit scores, the ratings firm said.
In the earlier deal, about 5 percent of the pool was to
individuals from outside the U.S.  Sales of non-agency mortgage securities have been building
after freezing five years ago amid tumbling home values and
soaring defaults, following issuance of $1.2 trillion in each of
2005 and 2006. Deals tied to new loans total about $12 billion
this year, up from $3.5 billion in all of last year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jumbo home loans are ones larger than allowed in
government-supported programs, currently as much as $729,750 for
single-family properties in high-cost areas. For  Fannie Mae  and
Freddie Mac loans with the lowest costs for most types of
borrowers, limits range from $417,000 to $625,500.  To contact the reporters on this story:
