The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 1.5 basis points to
109.5 basis points as of 11:11 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank AG. The index is on course for its lowest close
since May 29, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  declined 4 basis points to 135 as of
8:35 a.m. in Hong Kong,  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ)  prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest close since
Sept. 10, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1.5 basis points to 84.5
basis points as of 9:38 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index is on track for its lowest close since May 23,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
