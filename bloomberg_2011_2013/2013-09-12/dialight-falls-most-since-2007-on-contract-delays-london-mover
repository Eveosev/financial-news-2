Dialight Plc (DIA) , a maker of light-emitting diode fittings used at the  London  Olympics, plunged the
most in six years after saying full-year profit will probably
miss its forecasts as a result of delays in contract awards.  The  shares  slumped as much as 21 percent, the most in
intraday trading since April 2007, and were down 13 percent at
1,190 pence at 9:10 a.m. in London. The stock was the worst
performer in the  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX) , paring Dialight’s gain
this year to 12 percent.  It’s the second time in three months that Dialight said
delays in the roll-out of contracts for the mobile-phone tower
market would hurt profit. The shares dropped 13.5 percent on
June 11 after the Newmarket, England-based company said it would
miss first-half earnings estimates.  Dialight won one contract for so-called obstruction systems
for towers since announcing first-half earnings on July 22, and
made good progress toward being awarded others, the company said
in a statement today.  “The group does not expect these contracts to be awarded
in time to sufficiently impact the current financial year,” it
said. “This is likely to negatively affect the group’s
expectations for overall financial performance in 2013.”  Full-year profit will now probably be broadly in line with
last year, Dialight said. The company reported pretax profit of
19.8 million pounds ($31.3 million) for 2012.  The lighting unit continued to grow “very strongly with no
change in guidance for both the short and long term,” Dialight
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
