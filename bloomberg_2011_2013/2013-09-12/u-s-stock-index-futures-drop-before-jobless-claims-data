U.S.  stocks  fell, halting a seven-day win streak for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as materials producers slid amid growing concern over  Syria  and investors weighed the prospects for Federal Reserve stimulus cuts.  Barrick Gold Corp. dropped 5.5 percent as the precious metal slumped the most since July.  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest U.S. gold producer, lost 4.2 percent.  Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)  tumbled 5.4 percent after cutting its earnings forecast. Walt Disney Co. rallied 2.4 percent after saying it would buy back as much as $8 billion in shares. Pandora Media Inc. jumped 12 percent to a record after naming digital-advertising veteran Brian McAndrews as its new chief executive officer.  The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent to 1,683.42 at 4 p.m. in  New York , snapping the longest streak of gains since July. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  slipped 25.96 points, or 0.2 percent, to 15,300.64. About 5.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 4 percent below the three-month average.  “It shouldn’t be too surprising to see a modest pullback after the strong moves we’ve seen so far this month,”  Ryan Larson , the Chicago-based head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management (U.S.) Inc., said in an interview. His firm oversees $290 billion. “With data light over the next several sessions, potential headlines regarding Syria and the much anticipated FOMC meeting next week will garner much of the attention.”  The S&P 500 rallied 3.4 percent in September through yesterday, rebounding from the worst  monthly loss  since May 2012, as reports showed  China’s economy  has strengthened and the U.S. looked less likely to attack Syria.  Kerry Calls  The tensions increased today as U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  told top Syrian opposition figures in a phone call today that the option of a U.S. military strike remains on the table, according to a State Department official. Kerry arrived in Geneva for talks with his Russian counterpart on a proposal for Syria to surrender its chemical weapons.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad set conditions for the U.S., saying a deal must be a “two-way street” in which the Obama administration drops its military threats and stops arming Syrian rebels.  The tensions over Syria have competed for investor attention with concern about reductions in Fed stimulus. Investors have been scrutinizing economic data to determine whether growth is robust enough for the  Federal Open Market Committee  to pare back its monthly bond buying following its Sept. 17-18 meeting.  Report Glitch  A report today showed jobless claims in the U.S. declined last week to the lowest level since April 2006 as upgrades to computer systems in two states caused those employment agencies to report fewer applications.  “We’re going to ignore the report given the Labor Day holiday and this computer problem which calls into question the efficacy of the data,” said Phil  Orlando , New York-based chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, which manages about $380 billion in assets.  Economists estimate the Fed this month will taper its stimulus by $10 billion a month, to $75 billion, according to the median of 34 responses in a Bloomberg News survey. The purchases have helped the  S&P 500  rally as much as 153 percent since the beginning of the  bull market  in March 2009.  Volatility  Speculation about reductions has whipsawed stocks since May, when Fed officials first indicated cuts could start this year. The S&P 500  tumbled  5.8 percent from a record on May 21 through June 24. It rebounded 8.7 percent to close at its latest all-time high of 1,709.67 on Aug. 2. The gauge then slumped as much as 4.6 percent before the seven-day rally through yesterday brought it back to within 1.2 percent of the record and above the May 21 peak.  “The Fed has a golden opportunity next week to really provide the market needed visibility on the taper program,” Jim Russell, the senior equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said in an interview from Cincinnati. His firm oversees $112 billion. “Next week is going to be crucial for the markets.”  The CBOE Volatility Index, the gauge of  S&P 500 (SPX)  options prices known as  the VIX , rose 3.4 percent to 14.29. The equity volatility gauge has tumbled 16 percent in September after rallying 26 percent in August, the biggest monthly gain since May 2012. The index moves in the opposite direction to the S&P 500 about 80 percent of the time.  Gauges of materials producers and financial companies fell the most among the  10 main industry groups  in the S&P 500 today.  Banks, Miners  JPMorgan Chase & Co. slid 1.9 percent to $52.24 for the  worst performance  in the Dow. The bank may settle regulators’ probes into the bank’s credit-card debt collection practices and sales of identity-theft products as early as next week, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Silver dropped the most in nine weeks and gold touched a four-week low as a report showed euro-area industrial output contracted more than analysts estimated in July. Copper declined to a one-month low.  Barrick Gold, the largest miner of the metal, slipped 5.5 percent to $17.61 as gold futures for December delivery dropped 2.4 percent for the biggest drop for a most-active contract since July 5. Newmont decreased 4.2 percent to $28.23.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., the largest U.S. iron-ore producer, slumped 5.2 percent to $22.42 for the biggest drop in the benchmark index for American equities.  Yogawear, Disney  Lululemon retreated 5.4 percent to $65.29. The yogawear retailer searching for a new chief executive officer cut its profit forecast as new rivals enter its market and shoppers cut spending on clothing. Earnings per share will be as much as $1.97, down from a previous projection of a maximum of $2.01, the Vancouver-based company said. The average of 29 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was $1.99.  Disney jumped 2.4 percent to $65.49, the most in the Dow. The world’s biggest entertainment company plans to start the repurchase plan next year. The company will borrow to finance some of the buys, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said.  Pandora Media surged 12 percent to $23.97, the highest close since the stock began trading in June 2011. The biggest online radio service hired McAndrews in a push to lift revenue while fending off competition from Apple Inc. The executive was also named chairman and president, succeeding  Joe Kennedy .  Phone stocks were the only group among 10 in the S&P 500 to advance, rallying 1 percent. AT&T Inc. jumped 1.2 percent to $34.38 and Verizon Communications Inc. rose 1.8 percent to $47.35 to pace gains among Dow companies.  Verizon Borrows  Verizon produced a profit for investors of about $2.09 billion for agreeing to buy the record $49 billion of bonds it sold yesterday as the price of the securities surged. The debt sale topped Apple Inc.’s $17 billion offering in April and will help pay for the company’s planned $130 billion purchase of Vodafone Group Plc’s stake in  Verizon Wireless .  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., a developer of small-molecule pharmaceuticals, rose 2 percent to $81.40, and Ametek Inc., a manufacturer of electronic instruments, added 2.6 percent to $45.57. S&P Dow Jones Indices said the two companies will join the S&P 500, replacing Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and SAIC Inc.  AMD dropped 1.8 percent to $3.75 and SAIC added 1.3 percent to $14.96.  Strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said stocks will continue to rally as the bull market in equities moves into a new phase driven by earnings growth rather than expanding valuations.  Equities will produce more moderate returns with lower volatility in the second phase of the bull market, according to  Peter Oppenheimer , Goldman’s chief global equity strategist, who reiterated his bullish stance on stocks. Oppenheimer said in a March 2012 report that the prospects for returns from equities versus bonds “are as good as they have been in a generation.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft in New York at  ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net ; Aubrey Pringle in New York at  apringle1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at  lthomasson@bloomberg.net
