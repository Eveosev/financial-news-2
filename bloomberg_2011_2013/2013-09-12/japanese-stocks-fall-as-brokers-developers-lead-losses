Japanese shares fell, with the
Topix index retreating for a second day, as rubber-products
makers and brokerages led declines and investors awaited next
week’s  Federal Reserve  meeting.  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) ,  Asia ’s largest tiremaker, slipped 1.4
percent as the yen advanced and Deutsche Bank AG downgraded the
stock. Daiwa Securities Group Inc. slid 1.6 percent, pacing
losses among brokerages. Sharp Corp. sank 6 percent after
reports the TV maker will announce a share sale. Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. tumbled 8.1 percent as the carmaker was said to be
considering a public offering of stocks.  The Topix lost 0.4 percent to 1,184.36 at the close in
 Tokyo , with volume 18 percent higher than the 30-day average.
The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.3 percent to 14,387.27. The
Fed meets Sept. 17-18, with economists estimating the U.S.
central bank will taper its monthly bond buying by $10 billion
to $75 billion, according to the median of 34 responses in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “We’re in wait-and-see mode ahead of next week’s Fed
meeting,” said  Mitsushige Akino , chief  fund manager  at
Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “While the situation
in  Syria  has calmed and  China  looks like it’s seen the worst of
its slowdown, buying after the Olympics news seems to have run
its course and the yen has stopped weakening, making exporters
less attractive.”  The Topix advanced 7.1 percent this month amid optimism
about Tokyo hosting the 2020 Summer Games. The gauge soared 38
percent this year, as Japanese equities performed the best among
developed markets tracked by Bloomberg.  Machinery Orders  Core machinery orders, an indicator of future  capital
spending  that excludes volatile orders for ships and those from
utilities, were unchanged in July from the previous month, the
Cabinet Office said today in Tokyo. Economists expected a 2.4
percent increase. Orders rose 6.5 percent on the year, compared
with estimates for a 7.7 percent advance.  Japan ’s currency, which yesterday touched 100.61 per
dollar, its weakest level since July 22, advanced 0.6 percent to
99.27 today.  “After the market’s recent gains the timing is right for
some selling and the yen has started strengthening as well, so
we’re seeing some profit-taking,” said Kenji Shiomura, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at  Daiwa Securities , Japan’s second-largest brokerage. “The impact from machinery orders is limited
as they’re very volatile. And while they missed estimates,
they’re still recovering.”  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will announce that Japan will
raise the  sales tax  to 8 percent in April as planned, the
Yomiuri newspaper reported today without saying where it got the
information. The prime minister will detail a 5 trillion yen
stimulus package along with the levy increase, according to the
report. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said today Abe
has yet to make a decision on the tax.  Apple Suppliers  Japanese suppliers of Apple Inc. retreated for a second day
after the maker of the iPhone unveiled a cheaper model that
disappointed critics. Murata Manufacturing Co., which sells
electronic components and counts Apple as its  biggest customer ,
fell 3.1 percent to 6,820 yen. Daikin Industries Ltd. sank 1.5
percent to 5,190 yen.  Exporters declined as the yen strengthened. Carmakers and
electrical-appliance producers were the  biggest drags  on the
 Topix. (TPX)  Toyota Motor Corp., which gets more than 70 percent of
sales overseas, slipped 1.1 percent to 6,270 yen. Sony Corp.,
the nation’s No. 1 consumer-electronics exporter, lost 1.2
percent to 2,103 yen.  Bridgestone dropped 1.4 percent to 3,430 yen. Deutsche Bank
equity analyst  Kurt Sanger   downgraded  the stock to hold from buy
with a 12-month price target of 3,800 yen per share.  Mitsubishi Motors  Mitsubishi Motors fell the most on the Nikkei 225, plunging
8.1 percent to 1,028 yen. The carmaker is nearing a decision to
raise as much as 200 billion yen ($2 billion) via a public
offering of new shares to buy back preferred stock held by other
Mitsubishi companies, two people with direct knowledge of the
plan said. The company was bailed out by Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and
Mitsubishi Corp. in 2004 and 2005.  Sharp was the second-biggest loser on the  Nikkei 225 ,
sliding 6 percent to 363 yen. The company may announce a public
share sale and third-party allotment as early as next week,
according to Japanese media reports. The TV maker is trying to
rebuild its balance sheet after greater competition in liquid-crystal displays and flat-panel televisions drove it to losses
in the past two fiscal years.  Among stocks that rose, Nisshin Steel Holdings Co. climbed
2.5 percent to 1,277 yen, after briefly advancing to its highest
level since listing in 2012. Sony Financial Holdings Inc., which
is 60 percent  owned  by Sony Corp., increased 3.7 percent to
1,787 yen for the second-biggest gain on the Nikkei 225.  Foreign Investors  Overseas investors were net buyers of Japanese stocks in
the five days ended Sept. 6, after being net sellers the
previous two weeks. Foreigners bought a net 185.4 billion yen in
equities, the most in seven weeks, according to Ministry of
Finance data released today.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell less than 0.1 percent today.
The gauge gained 0.3 percent to a one-month high in  New York 
yesterday as diminishing concern over a military strike against
Syria offset Apple’s biggest decline since April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
