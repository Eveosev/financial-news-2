The Metropolitan Water Reclamation
District of Greater Chicago hired two companies to build a
facility that will help the agency comply with proposed state
limits on phosphorus in water supplies. The plant also will
produce fertilizer to offset the cost of the project.  The work will be done by Black & Veatch Corp., a
construction services company based in  Overland Park ,  Kansas ,
and Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies Inc., a designer and
operator of five recovery facilities in  North America  that is
based in  Vancouver , British Columbia, the agency said in a
statement. The plant will operate in conjunction with the
district’s Stickney Water Reclamation Plant, which serves 2.2
million people and is the largest facility of its kind in the
world, it said.  The district is adding the facility to comply with limits
proposed by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency on the
amount of phosphorus in water supplies, said Allison Fore, a
spokeswoman for the district. The new plant will remove
phosphorus and nitrogen from waste water streams and convert the
chemicals into fertilizer for agriculture use.  “Nutrient runoff is the No. 1 water environment issue
across the U.S.,” Fore said in an e-mail. “It is a significant
water quality problem in the Mississippi River basin and Great
Lakes states.”  The total price of the facility is still under negotiation,
she said. It’s expected to be completed by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
