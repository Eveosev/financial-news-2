(Corrects low for wheat in final paragraph in story first
published yesterday.)  Corn futures tumbled to a four-week
low after the U.S. government said domestic and world
inventories will be bigger than forecast. Wheat rose.  U.S.  corn reserves  on Aug. 31, 2014, will total 1.855
billion bushels, up from 1.837 billion forecast in August, after
farmers harvest a record crop this year, the Department of
Agriculture said. Global inventories will jump 24 percent to a
12-year high, boosting supplies of the grain used to make
livestock feed, ethanol and sweeteners.  The prospect of record harvests sent prices tumbling into a
bear market this year as U.S. fields recovered from a drought in
2012. Cheaper grain may boost profit for buyers including
 Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  and  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  Food costs
tracked by the UN fell to a 14-month low in August and are 15
percent below the record reached in 2011.  “The corn supplies are going to be excessive heading into
2014,” Chad Henderson, the president of Prime Agricultural
Commodities Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone
interview. “Rising inventories of both corn and wheat mean that
consumers will not have to rush out to buy ahead.”  Corn futures for delivery in December dropped 1.3 percent
to close at $4.6625 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade, after touching $4.5625, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Aug. 15. Prices are down 33 percent this year and
45 percent from a record $8.49 on Aug. 10, 2012.  Record Crops  U.S. farmers will collect a 13.843 billion bushels of corn
in 2013, the most ever and up from the 13.763 billion estimated
last month, the government said. The average projection of 34
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 13.641 billion. Domestic
output will rise 28 percent from the drought-reduced harvest
last year of 10.78 billion bushels, USDA data show.  “The corn crop was far enough developed that the hot, dry
weather in August did not cause as much damage to yields as some
expected,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in
West Des Moines,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “This
report is about rising supplies and lower prices to build some
new demand.”  The USDA also said domestic wheat reserves before next
year’s harvest will total 561 million bushels, compared with 551
million forecast in August and 544 million expected by analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. World production will be 708.9
million metric tons, up from 705.4 million forecast a month ago
and 655.2 million last year, the USDA said today.  “Record U.S. prices have encouraged global production of
grain, reducing the dominance of U.S. exports on the world
markets,” Roose said.  Wheat futures for delivery in December rose 0.8 percent to
close at $6.53 a bushel in  Chicago . After the USDA report,
prices slipped as much as 1.7 percent to $6.3725, the lowest
since Sept. 5. The grain is down 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
