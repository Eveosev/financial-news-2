South African corn futures fell
after rallying 1.4 percent yesterday.  Yellow corn for delivery in December decreased 0.4 percent
to settle at 2,175.20 rand ($219) a metric ton by the close on
the South African Futures Exchange. Yesterday’s gain was the
first in seven sessions. The white variety for delivery in the
same month was little changed at 2,343 rand a ton.  South Africa ,
which is the continent’s largest corn grower, uses yellow corn
mainly as  animal feed , while meal made from the white variety is
one of the nation’s staple foods.  Wheat for delivery in December dropped 0.1 percent to 3,375
rand a ton. South Africa is a net importer of the grain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
