Japan â€™s domestic shipments of solar
cells and modules surged almost four times in the fiscal first
quarter, the Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association said.  Local shipments totaled 1,654 megawatts in the three months
ended June 30, compared with 445 megawatts in the same period
last year, the group  said  in a statement today.  Imports, which are accounted for in the domestic shipments
results, increased almost nine times to 1,133 megawatts,
according to the group. Exports fell 79 percent to 35 megawatts.  Japan began offering above-market rates to clean energy
producers in July 2012 to spur investment in renewables such as
solar and wind after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident.  The data was compiled from 38 companies including Sharp
Corp.,  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , Suntech Power Japan Corp., and Trina Solar
(Japan) Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
