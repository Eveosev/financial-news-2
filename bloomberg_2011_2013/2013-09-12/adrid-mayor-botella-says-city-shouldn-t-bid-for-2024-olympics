Madrid  Mayor Ana Botella said the
Spanish city shouldn’t bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games, after
missing out on the 2020 edition last week.  Botella’s comments at a conference in Madrid were broadcast
by Television Espanola. She said she had informed Spanish Prime
Minister Mariano Rajoy of her view.  Tokyo  was selected as the 2020 summer games host on Sept.
7, beating Istanbul and Madrid in a vote of International
Olympic Committee members. It’s the third straight failure by
Madrid, which also missed out to  London  for 2012 and Rio de
Janeiro for 2016.  Spain’s Education Minister Jose Ignacio Wert, who also
oversees sports, told TVE that Botella’s opinion was “correct
and prudent” because bidding for the 2024 games will be even
more competitive. Paris and Berlin are almost certain to try for
the 2024 games, Wert said.  “The competition will be very strong,” Wert told
Television Espanola. Botella’s view “has all our support,” he
added.  Madrid officials had told  IOC members  last week in Buenos
Aires that 80 percent of Olympic venues were ready and the games
would help revive its economy after a six-year slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
