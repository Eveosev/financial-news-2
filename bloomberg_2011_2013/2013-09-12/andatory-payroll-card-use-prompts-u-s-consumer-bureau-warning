The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau today said it will police employer usage of
payroll cards to ensure workers don’t face hidden fees or other
abuses.  “The bureau intends to use its enforcement authority to
stop violations before they grow into systemic problems,
maximize remediation to consumers, and deter future
violations,” the agency said in an e-mailed statement.  The CFPB said it has received reports of employers,
particularly in retail and food-service industries, requiring
employees to receive wages only on payroll cards, a practice
prohibited by law. The agency also said it has received
complaints about unexpected fees for cash withdrawals, balance
inquiries and other uses of the cards.  Payroll cards resemble prepaid  debit cards , but are  funded
by wages paid by an employer. About 4.8 million of the payroll
cards were issued in 2011, a number that is expected to grow to
8.4 million in 2015, according to a Mercator Advisory Group
report from October 2012. The cards had $26.5 billion loaded
onto them in 2011, and could have $46.3 billion in 2015, the
Maynard, Massachusetts-based consultancy said.  Madeline Aufseeser, a senior analyst with the Boston-based
Aite Group, a financial services consultancy, called the CFPB
move “good for the industry and good for consumers” because it
serves as a reminder to employers while relying on existing
consumer-protection law instead of new regulations.  Bureau Jurisdiction  The consumer bureau, created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law,
has jurisdiction over payroll cards, and the ability to enforce
the law against both employers and financial institutions that
issue the cards, according to the statement. State law typically
regulates what payment methods employers must offer, according
to CFPB.  First Data Corp., which is owned by private equity firm
 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) , is the leader in the payroll card
business, according to Aufseeser, with 49 percent of the market.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Brentwood, Tennessee-based Comdata
Network Inc. each have about 5 percent of the market.  Employers “cannot mandate that their employees receive
wages on a payroll card,” CFPB Director  Richard Cordray  said in
an e-mailed statement. “And for those employees who choose to
receive wages on a payroll card, they are entitled to certain
federal protections.”  The law requires payroll card holders to receive
disclosures outlining all fees associated with the card, access
to the card account’s history, liability limits for unauthorized
use and error-resolution procedures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
