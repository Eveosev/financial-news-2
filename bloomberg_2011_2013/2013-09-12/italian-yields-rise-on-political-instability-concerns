Italian borrowing costs rose to the
highest in almost a year today at a sale of three, five and 15-year debt as investor concern about the country’s political
stability persists.  Italy sold 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion) of three-year
notes maturing in November 2016 at 2.72 percent, up from 2.33
percent when Italy sold similar maturing debt on July 11. That’s
the highest yield since October 2012. Investors bid 1.52 times
the amount of the notes sold, up from 1.34 at the previous sale.  “Our borrowing costs, instead of decreasing, continue to
suffer because of political instability,” Prime Minister Enrico Letta said yesterday at the Senate in Rome. “It’s a significant
cost, every year we pay 85 billion euros.”  Earlier this week, Italian 10-year bond yields rose above
those of  Spain  for the first time in 18 months on concern that
former Premier  Silvio Berlusconi  will pull his party out of the
current coalition government if he’s expelled from the Senate
following a tax fraud conviction. A Senate panel is scheduled to
resume discussions of the matter today.  The Rome-based Treasury also sold longer-term debt, placing
1.5 billion euros of 2028 bonds to yield 4.88 percent and 2
billion euros of two floating-rate 2018 notes. That’s a total of
7.5 billion euros of debt sold today equal to the auction’s
target.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield fell to 4.56 percent at 11:37
a.m. in Rome. The difference with comparable-maturing German
Bunds was 252.6 basis points, up 4.2 basis points from
yesterday.  With assistance from Lorenzo Totaro in  Rome . Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
