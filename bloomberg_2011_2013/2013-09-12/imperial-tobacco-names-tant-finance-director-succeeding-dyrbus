Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT) ,
 Europe ’s second-biggest tobacco company, said Oliver Tant will
succeed Bob Dyrbus as finance director in November.  Tant will be appointed to the board on Oct. 1 and will take
up the role of finance director on Nov. 5, Imperial said today
in a statement. Dyrbus will retire from the Bristol, England-based maker of Davidoff cigarettes at the end of the year.  “As we continue our strategic transition it’s important
that we have someone of Oliver’s caliber to lead the finance
team in supporting the sustainable growth of the business,” Ian
Napier, Imperial’s chairman, said in the statement. He thanked
Dyrbus for his “huge contribution” to the company.  Tant formerly held the role of vice chairman of consultancy
KPMG LLP, and has experience in organizational restructuring,
corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions across industries
including retail, private equity and insurance, according to the
statement.  Imperial is cutting costs to offset worsening conditions in
Europe and is seeking to develop alternative nicotine products
and electronic cigarettes in order to catch up with competitors
such as  British American Tobacco Plc. (BATS)  It agreed to buy  Dragonite
International Ltd. (329) ’s e-cigarette unit earlier this month for $75
million.  Dyrbus announced his intention to retire in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
