Lavonte David of the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers was fined $7,875 by the National Football League for
a late hit on quarterback Geno Smith that helped the  New York 
Jets pull out an 18-17 Week 1 victory,  NFL.com  reported, citing
an unidentified person familiar with the situation.  David hit Smith after the rookie stepped out of bounds at
the Buccaneers’ 45-yard line with 15 seconds left in the fourth

 Nick Folk ’s 48-yard field goal with two seconds left.  David, in his second season with the Buccaneers, plans to
appeal the fine, NFL.com said. David has a base salary of
$547,806 this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
