(Correct currency of the dividend payment.)  Logitech International begins
trading today without the right to receive a 0.21 Swiss francs
dividend declared May 23. Investors had to own the stock before
today to receive the payout, which traders deduct from the
companyâ€™s share price on the ex-dividend date.  To contact  Bloomberg News  for this story:
