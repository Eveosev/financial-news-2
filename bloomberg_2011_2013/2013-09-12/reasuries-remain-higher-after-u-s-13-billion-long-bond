Treasury 30-year bond yields
climbed from the lowest level in more than a week as the U.S.
auctioned $13 billion of the securities before the Federal
Reserve discusses its debt purchases at a meeting next week.  The long-bond sale drew a  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of debt offered,
of 2.4, versus 2.11 at the August sale. Treasuries rose earlier
as investors weighed prospects for Fed stimulus and economic
data from Europe and  Japan  damped growth optimism. U.S. retail
sales increased last month, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of economists before a government report tomorrow.  “It was a good auction,” said Michael Franzese, senior
vice president of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man Capital
Markets in New York. “There’s a lot of money on the sidelines.
The Fed may not be as aggressive in tapering as the market
thought they were going to be.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 30-year bond fell one basis
point or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.85 percent at 5 p.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of
the 3.625 percent security due in August 2043 gained 1/32, or 31
cents per $1,000 face amount, to 95 31/32.  The yield earlier dropped to 3.81 percent, the least since
Sept. 5. It climbed to 3.94 percent on Aug. 22, the highest
since August 2011.  The 10-year note yield was little changed at 2.91 percent
after touching 2.86 percent, the lowest since Sept. 4.  Trading Pace  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, dropped to $349 billion.
The 2013 average is $315 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index dropped to 96.38, the lowest level
since Aug. 27. It climbed on Sept. 5 to 114.19, a two-month
high. The 2013 average is 71.36.  The securities at today’s auction yielded 3.820 percent,
the most at a long-bond offering since July 2011. A Bloomberg
survey of 11 of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers forecast a yield of
3.823 percent.  A $21 billion 10-year note offering yesterday was sold at
2.946 percent, the highest yield at an auction since June 2011
and attracted the most demand since March, even as  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  sold a record $49 billion in bonds.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 37.7 percent of the securities at
today’s bond auction, the least since April, compared with a
38.6 percent average at the past 10 offerings.  Auction Demand  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 20.6 percent,
the most since June 2012, versus the average 14.5 percent at the
past 10 auctions.  Treasuries rose yesterday amid bets that Verizon’s debt
sale would lead to the unwinding of hedges used to guard against
higher yields. As companies sell debt, they enter into rate-lock
agreements, in which they bet on Treasury prices falling to
guard against higher yields. Once the debt is sold, they end the
wagers.  “These are levels to buy rather than to sell,”  said
Thomas Roth, senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi
UFJ Securities USA Inc. “The Verizon deal was a blowout. It
emboldened people to think the worst is behind us so we are
seeing better buying.”  This year’s auctions have seen a decline in average demand.
Investors bid $2.88 for each dollar of the $1.508 trillion in
U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction in 2013,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  Bonds Returns  Thirty-year bonds have lost 15 percent this year, compared
with a 3.9 percent drop in the broader U.S. Treasuries market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Long bonds
returned 2.5 percent in 2012, versus a 2.2 percent gain by
Treasuries overall.  Today’s offering is the third of three U.S. note and bond
auctions this week totaling $65 billion. The government sold $31
billion in three-year debt on Sept. 10 at a yield of 0.913
percent. Yesterday’s 10-year auction drew a yield of 2.946
percent and a  bid-to-cover  ratio of 2.86, compared with an
average of 2.73 for the past 10 sales.  Yields declined earlier amid weaker-than-forecast global
economic data. Factory production in the euro region fell 1.5
percent from June, when it gained 0.6 percent, the European
Union’s statistics office said today. That’s more than the 0.3
percent contraction forecast by economists, according to the
median of 33 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Japan Stalls  Japanese machinery orders were unchanged in July from the
previous month when they fell 2.7 percent, the Cabinet Office
said in  Tokyo . Economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted an
increase of 2.4 percent.  Treasury yields surged last month amid concern the Fed may
slow its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, a climb that
ended after data on Sept. 6 showed lower-than-forecast job gains
in August.  “The rise in yields was based on whatever tapering the Fed
is going to do -- people feel we’ve priced that into the
market,” Roth of Mitsubishi UFJ Securities said.  The Federal Open Market Committee will decide at its Sept.
17-18 meeting to reduce monthly purchases of Treasuries to $35
billion from $45 billion, according to the median of 34
responses in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Policy makers
will maintain mortgage-bond buying at  $40 billion  under the
central bank’s quantitative-easing program, the survey shows.  The U.S. budget deficit narrowed in August from a year
earlier as a stronger job market boosted revenue, propelling the
world’s largest economy toward its smallest annual shortfall
since 2008.  Outlays exceeded receipts by $147.9 billion last month,
compared with a $190.5 billion gap in August 2012, the Treasury
Department said today in  Washington . In the 11 months through
the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, the deficit was $755.3
billion, the narrowest for that period in five years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
