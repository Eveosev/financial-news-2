Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s changes to its
privacy policy have drawn the attention of U.S. regulators who
have discussed the matter with the most popular social-networking service, an official said today.  Privacy groups on Sept. 4 asked the Federal Trade
Commission to prevent Facebook from changing its data use
policies, citing concerns on how the Menlo Park, California-based company handles user information for advertising. The
proposed update would violate a settlement with the trade
commission, the groups said in a letter.  “As in all cases we’re monitoring compliance with the
order, and part of that involves interacting with Facebook,”
Peter Kaplan, a spokesman for the FTC, said in an interview.
“We talked with them about the specific changes.”  The changes “clarify and explain” Facebook’s existing
practices, Jodi Seth, a Washington-based spokeswoman for the
company, said in an e-mail.  “We routinely discuss policy updates with the FTC and this
time is no different,” Seth said. “Our updated policies do not
grant Facebook any additional rights to use consumer information
in advertising.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
