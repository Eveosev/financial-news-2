Cocoa supplies will probably trail
demand until at least the 2015-16 season as prices paid to
farmers in West Africa are too low to encourage more production,
according to Complete Commodity Solutions Ltd.  Global production will be 129,000 metric tons lower than
demand in the 12 months starting Oct. 1, Euan Mann, director at
the London-based company, said at a conference in Istanbul
today. That follows a shortage of 119,000 tons this year.
Governments in West Africa have already sold most of their next
crop forward and local prices next season probably won’t be
“significantly higher” to incentivize farmers to increase
output, he said.  “This means incentives for 2014-15 husbandry will be
similar to current levels and that a potential increase in
production would only come in the following year if the West
African regulators are able to sell the 2014-15 crops forward at
higher prices,” Mann said in an interview at the European Cocoa
Association conference.  Cocoa futures traded in  London  rose to the highest in
almost a year at 1,685 pounds ($2,665) a ton on Sept. 5,
entering a bull market, as dry weather threatened crops in West
Africa, the top growing region, just as demand started to
recover. Bean processing is forecast to grow 2.5 percent this
season and in 2013-14, Mann said.  Ivory Coast, the world’s largest producer, sold 1.05
million tons of cocoa from its 2013-14 crop, according to two
people with direct knowledge of the sales. The sales were done
by the end of July, the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information isn’t public, said last month. Ivory
Coast’s output may be 1.4 million tons in 2013-14, Ecobank
Transnational Inc., a Lome, Togo-based lender, said in an Aug.
29 report. Both Ivory Coast and  Ghana , the second-biggest
producer, sell most of their crops forward before harvesting
starts.  Cocoa prices, at 1,676 pounds a ton in London today, will
need to rise to 1,800 pounds to 2,200 pounds to ensure supplies
meet or exceed rising demand, creating a “sustainable cocoa
market,” Mann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
