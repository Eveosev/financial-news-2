U.S. corn inventories before next
year’s harvest will be larger than the government forecast last
month because of higher yields for the grain.   Reserves on Aug. 31, 2014, will be 1.855 billion bushels,
up from 1.837 billion (46.7 million metric tons) forecast in
August, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
report. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projected 1.739 billion,
on average. Inventories before the start of this year’s harvest
will be 661 million bushels, compared with 719 million forecast
a month earlier and 989 million last year.  Farmers will collect a record 13.843 billion bushels, up
from 13.763 billion estimated last month, the USDA said after
completing its second survey of farmers and fields. The average
projection of 34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 13.641
billion.  Average yields this year will be 155.3 bushels an acre,
compared with 154.4 bushels estimated in August and 123.4
bushels in 2012. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projected 153.9
bushels, on average.  World  output  in the year that begins Oct. 1 will be 956.67
million tons, compared with 957.15 million forecast in August,
the USDA said. Global  inventories  before the start of the
Northern Hemisphere harvests in 2014 will be 151.42 million
tons, compared with 150.17 million projected in August. Traders
forecast a drop to 148.97 million, on average.  Through yesterday, corn futures on the Chicago Board of
Trade tumbled 39 percent in the past 12 months to $4.725 a
bushel.  Corn at the farm gate may average $4.80 a bushel in the 12
months that began Sept. 1, compared with $4.90 forecast in
August, the USDA said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
