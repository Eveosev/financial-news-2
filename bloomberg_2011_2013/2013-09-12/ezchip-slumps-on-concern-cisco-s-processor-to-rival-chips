EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH)  tumbled
to a four-month low in New York on concern  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) 
will develop the Israeli chipmaker’s technology in-house,
reducing revenue growth.  Shares of the Yokneam, Israel-based company slumped 22
percent to $23.99 at 10:52 a.m. in New York, with trading
volumes 21 times the daily average over the past 90 days.  Cisco, the biggest maker of networking equipment, said
today that it will develop its own nPower integrated network
processor. EZchip  received  about 40 percent of its revenue from
Cisco, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The product will
compete with EZchip’s product, said  Jay Srivatsa , an analyst
Chardan Capital Markets LLC.  Cisco’s processor “looks to compete with EZchip’s own
solution,” Srivatsa said by phone from New York today. “The
reality is that the platform for Cisco’s next-generation
solutions incorporate EZchip’s products. However, it could
affect products down the line.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
