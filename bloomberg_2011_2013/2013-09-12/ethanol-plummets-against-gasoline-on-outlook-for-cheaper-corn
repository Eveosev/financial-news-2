Ethanol plummeted against gasoline
on speculation that a government report today will show corn
production higher than a year earlier, decreasing costs for
distillers to make the biofuel from the grain.  The spread, or discount, expanded by 6.12 cents to 89.04 at
10:51 a.m.  New York  time. Corn production may climb to 13.6
billion bushels from 10.78 billion last year, according to a
survey of 34 analysts and trading firms by  Bloomberg News . The
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  will release its forecasts, based
on farmer and field surveys, at noon today in Washington.  “Prompt ethanol started this morning being offered
aggressively,” said Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in
Jupiter, Florida.  Denatured ethanol for October delivery slid 2.8 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $1.855 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have dropped 15 percent this year.  Gasoline for October delivery rose 3.32 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.7454 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for December delivery fell 4 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$4.685 a bushel in Chicago. September corn added 3.5 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $4.8325. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons
of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
