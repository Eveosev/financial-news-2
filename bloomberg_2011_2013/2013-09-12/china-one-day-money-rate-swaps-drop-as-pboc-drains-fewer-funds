China ’s overnight money-market rate
dropped by the most in a week and  interest-rate swaps  fell after
the central bank drained fewer funds from the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China took out a net 1.1 billion  yuan 
($180 million) this week, compared with 37 billion yuan in the
period ended Sept. 6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The PBOC added 10 billion yuan via 14-day reverse-repurchase
agreements at 4.1 percent today, according to a statement posted
on its website. Markets are closed Sept. 19-20 for a holiday.  “The central bank clearly wants to keep rates stable, so
it acted preemptively to reduce the amount of drainage to get
prepared for holidays next week,” said Cheng Qingsheng, an
analyst at Evergrowing Bank Co. in  Shanghai . “Next week could
be a little bit tighter, but I don’t expect any big spike.”  The one-day repurchase  rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the banking system, dropped five basis points to
2.97 percent as of 11:13 a.m. in Shanghai, according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. The  seven-day repo  climbed three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.52 percent.  The cost of one-year swap contracts, the fixed payment to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, declined four basis
points to 4.13 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  China’s key economic risk is government debt, which
accounts for 50 percent of annual gross domestic product, higher
than about 38 percent in 2011, Zhang Monan, a researcher with
the State Information Center at the National Development and
Reform Commission, wrote in an article published by the
Securities Times today.  Government bonds  rose, with the yield on 4.08 percent notes
due 2023 dropping one basis point to 4.15 percent, according to
prices from the Interbank Funding Center. Benchmark 10-year
rates reached 4.14 percent yesterday, the highest since August
2008, according to Chinabond data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
