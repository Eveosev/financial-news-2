Soybean output in the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer, will be smaller than the government
forecast last month after hot, dry Midwest weather eroded yield
potential.  Farmers will  harvest  3.149 billion bushels this year,
compared with 3.255 billion (88.6 million metric tons) estimated
in August and last year’s drought-damaged crop of 3.015 billion,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report .
Analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  expected 3.134 billion.  Yields were forecast at 41.2 bushels an acre, in line with
analyst expectations. Last month, the government predicted 42.6
bushels, up from 39.6 a year earlier. Harvested acreage was
forecast at 76.4 million acres, unchanged from last month and up
from 76.1 million in 2012, the agency said.  Temperatures averaged as much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit above
normal in the 30 days ended Sept. 8 in parts of the Midwest,
according to  data  from the High Plains Regional Climate Center.
Some fields from  North Dakota  to  Ohio  received less than 25
percent of normal rain during the period. Moderate to extreme
 drought  conditions expanded to 29 percent of nine Midwest states
as of Sept. 3, up from 3.5 percent three months earlier,
government data show.  U.S.  reserves  on Aug. 31, 2014, before next year’s harvest,
will total 150 million bushels, up from 125 million a year
earlier, the  agency  said. The average estimate of 34 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 165 million bushels.  Global  output  in the crop year that begins Oct. 1 will be
281.66 million metric tons, compared with 281.72 million
forecast last month, the USDA said. Worldwide  inventories  before
the start of the 2014 Northern Hemisphere harvest will be 71.54
million tons, down from 72.27 million predicted in August, the
USDA said. Traders expected reserves to fall to 71.1 million, on
average.  Through yesterday, soybean futures on the Chicago Board of
Trade tumbled 20 percent in the past year to $13.5825 a bushel.  The USDA raised its average farm gate price in the
marketing year that began Sept. 1 to $12.50 a bushel from $11.35
a bushel forecast in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
