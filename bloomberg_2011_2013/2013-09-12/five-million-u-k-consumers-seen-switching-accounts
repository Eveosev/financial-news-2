Almost 5 million U.K. consumers may
switch checking accounts in the next 12 months using a new
service designed to boost competition among lenders including
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , according to a study.  Starting Sept. 16 customers will be able to move to a
different bank within seven days, compared with as long as 30
days currently. This will make customers more likely to move
accounts, SAS Institute Inc., a U.S. business analytics company,
using data from  YouGov Plc (YOU) , said in a statement today.  “Historically, consumer churn between retail banks has
been between 2 and 3 percent, however our research suggests this
could increase significantly,” Nick Payne, retail banking
consultant, SAS U.K. & Ireland, said in a statement.  Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is considering
whether to make banks relinquish control of the payments system
in a push for greater competition with new “challenger” banks.
Britain’s four largest lenders have about 75 percent of the
market of 76 million checking accounts, the Office of Fair
Trading said in January.  Financial institutions will redirect payments and deposits
for customers moving their account to another bank with
customers refunded any charges should the process go wrong,
according to the industry-funded Payments Council.  YouGov polled 2,215 checking account customers from Sept. 2
to Sept. 4, for the research, Cary, North Carolina-based SAS
said.  -- Editor: Jon Menon  To contact the reporter on this story:
