Industrias Penoles SAB,  Mexico ’s
second-biggest mining company by market value, led  declines  on
the nation’s benchmark stock index as precious metals fell and
concern mounted that the government would boost mining taxes.  Penoles, which extracts gold and silver, fell 4.9 percent
to 420 pesos at 2:44 p.m. in Mexico City, the most among 35
companies on the benchmark IPC gauge, which fell 2.1 percent.  Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto’s proposal presented
to Congress this week would impose a 7.5 percent tax on earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization generated
through mine production. It would also apply a new 0.5 percent
tax on sales of gold, silver and platinum. Gold futures fell 2.5
percent as a drop in U.S. jobless claims increased speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  would reduce stimulus.  “We don’t like the precious-metals market,” Jorge Lagunas, who oversees $200 million in stocks at Grupo Financiero
Interacciones SA, said in a telephone interview from Mexico
City. “We see a cycle of rising interest rates, for one thing,
and we don’t like the fact that they’re going to tax precious
metals. ”  To contact the reporter on this story:
