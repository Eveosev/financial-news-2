U.K. stocks declined from their
highest level in almost a month as data showed industrial output
in the euro area, Britain’s biggest export market, contracted
more than estimated.  The FTSE 100 Index retreated 23.15 points, or 0.4 percent,
to 6,565.28 at 10:28 a.m. in  London . The equity benchmark has
fallen 4 percent from a 13-year high on May 22 after the  Federal
Reserve  said it may start reducing its monthly bond purchases
this year. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also slid 0.4
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index lost 0.7 percent.  A Eurostat report showed that euro-area industrial output
fell 1.5 percent in July from a month earlier, when it gained
0.6 percent. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 0.3 percent drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
