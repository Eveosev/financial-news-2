Gasoline climbed as crude advanced
before talks between the U.S. and Russia over disposing of
Syria’s chemical weapons and as U.S. jobless claims dropped.  Futures rose as much as 2.1 percent.  Applications (INJCJC)  for
 unemployment insurance  fell by 31,000 to 292,000 last week, the
fewest since April 2006, Labor Department data show. Secretary
of State  John Kerry  will press for a timeline for Syria to
surrender its chemical arsenal, an American official said, as
Russia’s leader urged the U.S. to steer clear of a Middle East
military clash.  “The headline is we’re under 300,000 jobless claims and
that’s huge,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlook &
Opinions LLC in Houston. “And the Syria issue has not gone
away.”  Gasoline for October delivery rose 3.66 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.7488 a gallon at 10:10 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, after settling yesterday at the lowest
settlement since Jan. 15. Trading volume was 1 percent below the
100-day average.  President  Barack Obama  has put on hold a request to
Congress to approve a limited strike against Syria for its
alleged use of sarin nerve gas against its own people. Kerry and
Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  are scheduled to meet at
7:30 p.m. Geneva time for talks slated to run through tomorrow.  “We went from pricing in war to pricing in peace and now
we’re into pricing in the middle,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  Crack Spreads  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude widened 93 cents to $7.28 a barrel while the
fuel’s  premium  over Brent rose 63 cents to $3.04.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.8 cent to $3.55 a
gallon, 30.8 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA

cents, or 1 percent, to $3.1016 a gallon on trading volume that
was 0.7 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 59 cents to $22.05 a
barrel while the  premium  over Brent rose 31 cents to $17.83.  To contact the reporter on this story:
