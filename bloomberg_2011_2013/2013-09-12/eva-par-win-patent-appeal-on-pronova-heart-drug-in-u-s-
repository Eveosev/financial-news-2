Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. and
Par Pharmaceutical Cos. won an appeal in their bid to sell a
generic version of  BASF SE (BAS) ’s heart medicine Lovaza in the U.S.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit in a
ruling today said it reversed a lower court decision because one
patent held by BASF’s Pronova unit had been made publicly
accessible and another had expired.  The ruling sent shares of Amarin Corp., the maker of a
competing medicine, down as much as  12 percent , the biggest drop
since December 2012. Teva’s American depositary receipts, rose
1.1 percent to $38.94 at 12:14 p.m.  New York  time.  Lovaza is the first and only fish-oil derived prescription
drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and
Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva and Par want to market generic
versions, the court said in its ruling.  U.S. sales of Lovaza were more than $2.3 billion as of
August 2010, the court said.  Pronova was acquired this year by Ludwigshafen, Germany-based BASF, and Par was bought last year by TPG Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
