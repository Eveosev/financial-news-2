The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  jumped the most in four months.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
outstanding rose $19.9 billion to $1.035 trillion in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
Thatâ€™s the biggest increase since the period ended May 22 and
the highest level since the market touched $1.0353 trillion in
the week ended July 3.  IOUs issued by  non-financial  companies climbed $12.1
billion to $227.6 billion, the highest level since the week
ended July 3, the Fed said.  The amount issued by  U.S.-based banks  rose $12 billion to
$276.5 billion outstanding, the biggest jump since the period
ended May 15, according to the Fed.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
