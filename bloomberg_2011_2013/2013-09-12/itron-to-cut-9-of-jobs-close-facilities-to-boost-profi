Itron Inc. (ITRI) , the Liberty Lake,
Washington-based manufacturer of meters for water and energy
companies, plans to cut 750 jobs, or 9 percent of its workforce,
and close or consolidate several facilities to boost
profitability.  Itron estimates the cuts will cost $30 million to $35
million pretax, most of which will be incurred in the third
quarter, according to a  filing  with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission today. The company expects to save about $30
million a year as a result of the changes.  Itron gained 2.6 percent to $40.37 at the close in  New
York . The shares have declined 9.4 percent this year. The
company is expected to report a second year of sales declines
for 2013, according to the average of 15 analystsâ€™  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Itron won two contracts in June to supply a total of
210,000 meters in  India  to help curb water losses and improve
infrastructure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
