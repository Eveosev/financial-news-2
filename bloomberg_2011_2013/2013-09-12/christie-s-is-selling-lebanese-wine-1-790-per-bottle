Art collector Joel Mallin has
engaged Christie’s International auction house to sell wines
from his 6,000-bottle cellar, featuring top vintages from
Burgundy,  Bordeaux  and Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley.  Mallin and his wife Sherry are best known for collecting
sculpture, including works by Richard Serra and Andrew
Goldsworthy.  Mallin, who began buying wine over three decades ago, plans
to sell 700 bottles, he said in a telephone interview. He
estimated that the collection -- which includes bottles from
 Chateau Latour  in Bordeaux and  La Tache  from Burgundy -- would
sell for approximately $200,000, or about $286 per bottle.  “Since I’m 80 years old, I’m not going to be able to drink
it all,” Mallin said.  French billionaire Francois Pinault owns Latour as well as
London-based Christie’s.  Mallin said that the most valuable wines in the sale are
two cases of La Tache, from  Domaine de la Romanee-Conti . He
estimated that the wines, from 1986 and 1988, will sell for
$2,000 to $3,000 per bottle.  The consignment also includes wine from  Chateau Margaux ,
another premiere Bordeaux, according to documents that
Christie’s filed on Aug. 23 with the New York State Department
of State.  A rarity in the collection is Chateau Musar Gaston Hochar,
a Bordeaux-style wine from Lebanon whose 1959 vintage, included
in the offering, sells for as much as $1,790 per bottle.  Online Sale  Some of the wine will be sold during a two-week online
auction that began this week, according to Mallin. The remainder
will be sold at a live auction that Christie’s scheduled for
Oct. 11 in New York.  Sung-Hee Park, a Christie’s spokeswoman, said that 700 lots
of wine will be sold through the online auction, with each lot
consisting of as little as one bottle or as much as an entire
case. She declined to comment on whether any of the wine to be
sold belonged to Mallin.  A semi-retired tax lawyer, Mallin and his wife began
collecting sculpture in the 1980s and are now ranked among the
world’s top 200 collectors by ARTnews. The couple has 70 outdoor
sculptural installations at their 15-acre home in Westchester
County, New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
