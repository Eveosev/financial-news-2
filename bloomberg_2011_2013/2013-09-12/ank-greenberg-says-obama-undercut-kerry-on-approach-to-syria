Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, former
chairman of American International Group Inc., said President
Barack Obama’s shift in approach undercut Secretary of State  John Kerry ’s efforts to punish Syria for use of chemical weapons.  “You can’t threaten, then walk away,” Greenberg told
Bloomberg Television’s Betty Liu in an interview today on the
“In the Loop” program. “Who’s going to believe Kerry in the
future?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
