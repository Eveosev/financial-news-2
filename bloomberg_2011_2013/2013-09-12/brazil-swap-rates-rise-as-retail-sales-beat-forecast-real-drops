Brazil ’s swap rates climbed as
retail sales advanced in July by the most this year, adding to
speculation that the central bank will sustain the pace of
increases in borrowing costs to stem inflation.  Swap rates on contracts due in January 2015 rose eight
basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 10.44 percent at 9:56
a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The real fell 0.2 percent to 2.2795 per U.S.
dollar after rallying yesterday to a one-month high.  Retail sales rose 6 percent in the 12 months through July,
the national statistics agency reported today. The increase
exceeded the forecasts of all 32 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. To curb inflation, the central bank has lifted
borrowing costs at the fastest pace among major economies.  “This data could contribute to avoiding a contraction in
the economy this quarter,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief
strategist at Banco Mizuho do Brasil in Sao Paulo, said in a
telephone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
