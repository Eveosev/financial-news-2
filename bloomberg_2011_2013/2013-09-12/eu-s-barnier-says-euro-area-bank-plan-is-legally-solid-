A European Union plan to create a
common fund that could be tapped to stabilize failing banks is
“legally solid,”  Michel Barnier , the bloc’s financial services
commissioner, said.  “I know that  Germany , in particular, has some concerns,”
he said in prepared remarks for a Frankfurt speech. “We are
confident that our proposal is legally solid. I will repeat this
later this week in Vilnius when I meet the EU Ministers of
Finance and Governors of the Central Banks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
