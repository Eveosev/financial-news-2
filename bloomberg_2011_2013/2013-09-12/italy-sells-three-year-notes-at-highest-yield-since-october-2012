Italy sold three-year notes at the
highest yield since October 2012.  The Rome-based Treasury auctioned 4 billion euros of
securities maturing in November 2016 to yield 2.72 percent, up
from 2.33 percent at an auction of similar-maturity debt on July
11. It also sold bonds due in 2028 and floating-rate notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
