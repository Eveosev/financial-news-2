U.S. Bancorp (USB)  expects its mortgage
revenue to drop 20 percent in the third quarter from the second
period amid a decline in mortgage applications and mortgage
production, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Cecere said.  Mortgage applications will probably decline 40 percent in
the three months ending Sept. 30 from the previous quarter, and
and mortgage production will drop 20 percent, Cecere said today
at the Minneapolis-based bank’s investor day conference in New
York. The company’s second-quarter mortgage-banking revenue was
$396 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
