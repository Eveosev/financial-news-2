Russian stocks snapped the longest
streak of gains since 2010 as a technical indicator showed the
benchmark gauge may be overbought and power companies sank.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  lost 0.2 percent to 1,452.00 by 12:02 p.m.
in Moscow, its first decline in nine days. The gauge’s 14-day
Relative Strength Index rose to 70.8 yesterday, the highest
since Jan. 28, signaling a possible drop. OAO Russian Grids
tumbled 2.9 percent to 1.043 rubles, while Federal Grid Co.
retreated 1.9 percent to 10.71 kopeks. Utility-company shares
declined 1.5 percent on average.  The Economy Ministry, which is seeking ways to curb
consumer-price growth and spur expansion, has proposed freezing
utilities’ prices next year. President  Vladimir Putin  supported
the measure at a budget meeting yesterday, Economy Minister
 Alexei Ulyukayev  told reporters. Crude oil, Russia’s main export
earner, retreated 0.1 percent to $107.43 a barrel in  New York .  “The market is overbought, investors expect stocks to roll
back today,” Andrey Vashevnik, chief investment officer for
Russian markets at R&B Russia Investment Fund Ltd, said by
phone. “The lack of clarity on what’s going to happen to
utilities’ tariffs is causing the stocks to fall.”  The RSI measures how rapidly prices have advanced or
dropped during a specified time period. Readings below 30
indicate a security may be poised to rise, while those above 70
signal a potential retreat. The Micex surged 4.3 percent last
week, the most since December 2011.  VTB Earnings  VTB Group retreated 0.8 percent to 4.43 kopeks. Russia’s
second-biggest lender posted  net income  in the second quarter of
12.6 billion rubles ($385 million), compared with an average
analyst estimate for 15.4 billion rubles, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest producer of coal for
steelmakers, advanced 3.2 percent to 115.10 rubles, the highest
intraday level since May 29 and the biggest gain by percentage
points on the Micex.  OAO Rostelecom, Russia’s state-run phone company, increased
2.1 percent to 110.46 rubles. Deutsche Bank AG and the Russian
Direct Investment Fund may jointly pay $241 million to buy 2.45
percent of the company, Kommersant reported today, citing a
person it didn’t identify with knowledge of the deal.  Russia’s central bank will keep the  refinancing rate 
unchanged at 8.25 percent at a meeting in Moscow tomorrow,
according to 14 out of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Eight forecast a cut to 8 percent. The main lending and deposit
rates will also stay unchanged, two separate surveys show.  Cheapest Valuations  Russia ’s economy expanded 1.2 percent in the second
quarter, the Federal Statistics Service reported on Aug. 9,
missing the median forecast for 2 percent. The central bank
refrained from cutting  interest rates  for an 11th month on Aug.
9, while highlighting “significant” risks to growth.  Russian equities have the cheapest  valuations  among 21
emerging economies tracked by Bloomberg, with shares trading at
3.8 times 12-month estimated earnings, compared with a multiple
of 10.5 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 27 percent
above the 30-day average, while 10-day price swings subsided to
18.959.  The dollar-denominated RTS Index added 0.3 percent at
1,398.64. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian stocks in New York rose 0.5 percent yesterday,
while the  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, gained 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
