SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS)  rose
4.7 percent in late trading after reporting that revenue
increased 3 percent this year through August.  SeaWorld, based in Orlando, Florida, advanced to $30 in
extended trading after the announcement. The stock fell 3.8
percent to $28.65 earlier in  New York . It has climbed 6.1
percent since its initial public offering in April.  Admissions revenue was up 4 percent, SeaWorld said in a
statement. The company is poised for a record year, based on a
previously issued forecast for $430 million to $440 million in
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, it said.  “Performance was particularly strong at our flagship
SeaWorld parks in Orlando and San Diego,” Chief Executive
Officer Jim Atchison said in the statement.  SeaWorld slumped in late August after it offered  discounts 
including a free children’s ticket for area residents who
purchase an adult pass in  San Diego , and a 46 percent midweek
discount in  Orlando  for tickets bought online.  Attendance fell 9 percent in the second quarter, Chief
Financial OfficerJames Heaney said in August when the company
reported its results. For the first half of 2013, admissions
revenue climbed 3.8 percent to $407.4 million, SeaWorld said on
Aug. 13. Total revenue advanced 1.8 percent to $649.9 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
