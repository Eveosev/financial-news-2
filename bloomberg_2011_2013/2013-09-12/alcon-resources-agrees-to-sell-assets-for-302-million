Halcon Resources Corp. (HK) , the oil and
natural gas company run by former Petrohawk Energy Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman Floyd C. Wilson, agreed to sell
certain U.S. assets for a total of $302 million.  The three transactions are expected to close in the fourth
quarter and the properties being sold currently produce the
equivalent of approximately 4,500 barrels of oil a day, the
Houston-based company said in a statement today.  “The divestment of these non-core assets will provide us
with additional liquidity and allow us to be a more focused and
concentrated oil company,” Wilson, CEO and chairman of Halcon,
said in the statement.  Halcon, founded in 2011,  has dropped  29 percent this year
as the Russell 2000 Energy Index has risen 24 percent. In
October, the company bought some of Petro-Hunt LLC’s North
Dakota fields for approximately $1.45 billion in cash and stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
