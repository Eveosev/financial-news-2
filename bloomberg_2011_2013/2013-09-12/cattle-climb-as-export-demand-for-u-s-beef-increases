Cattle futures rose on signs of
increasing export demand for U.S. beef. Hog prices climbed.  In the week ended Sept. 5, export sales of beef rose 5
percent to 18,857 metric tons (41.6 million pounds) from the
previous week and were 17 percent higher than the four-week
average, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed today.  “Our exports numbers may help us out a bit,”  Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures Inc. in  Oklahoma
City , said in a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $1.286 a pound at 9:36 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Through yesterday, the most-active contract dropped
2.8 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement advanced less
than 0.1 percent to $1.5825 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement gained 0.3 percent to
87.475 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
