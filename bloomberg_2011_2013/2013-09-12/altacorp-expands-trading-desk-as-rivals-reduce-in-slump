AltaCorp Capital Inc. Chief
Executive Officer George Gosbee is expanding the financial
advisory firm’s institutional trading desk in Toronto to capture
talent while other banks cut.  AltaCorp, based in Calgary, hired seven traders in Toronto,
bringing the company’s headcount to 51 people. The additions
follow the move by Vancouver-based Haywood Securities Inc. to
cut 7 percent of its workforce and the exit of Stifel Financial
Corp. from  Canada  last month amid a slump in mining and energy
deals.  “I always like to be the contrarian,” Gosbee said in a
phone interview today. “It’s investing counter-cyclically. You
have to strike while people are available.”  AltaCorp perceives a current lack of “market-making
activity” in the resource sector, Gosbee said. He estimates a
busy next couple of months for energy mergers and acquisitions
and initial public offerings in Canada, after a slow three
years, he said. The company also hired another research analyst
in Toronto, it said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
