The  Bank of Korea  held its key
 interest rate  steady on economic resilience that is attracting
foreign capital and made the won the best performer in  Asia  over
the past month.  Governor Kim Choong Soo and his board kept the  seven-day
repurchase rate  at 2.5 percent for a fourth straight month, the
central bank said in a statement in  Seoul  today. All 15
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted the move.  With inflation near its lowest since 1999, the BOK has room
to keep its policy rate steady, as signs that  China’s economy  is
rebounding back the central bank’s forecast that domestic growth
will accelerate this year. Continued capital inflows, even as
speculation of  Federal Reserve  tapering draws global investors
to the U.S., reduce the need for the BOK to raise rates.  “The nation sees steady capital inflows unlike some other
emerging countries, which gives much room for the Bank of  Korea 
to keep the rate low for economic growth,” said Lee Sang Jae,
chief economist at Hyundai Securities Co. in Seoul, before the
announcement.  The BOK will increase its benchmark rate to 2.75 percent by
the end of next year, according to the median forecast in a
survey of 19 economists by Bloomberg News.  The Federal Reserve meets Sept. 17-18, with economists
estimating the central bank will taper its monthly bond buying
by $10 billion to $75 billion, according to the median of 34
responses in a  Bloomberg News  survey.  Easing Over  The won rose 0.4 percent to 1,082.25 per dollar as of 10:17
a.m. in Seoul. The Kospi stock index was roughly unchanged.  “The monetary easing cycle is over. Pressures stemming
from potential tapering of asset purchases by the U.S. Fed will
limit additional rate cuts in Korea,” said Ronald Man, a Hong
Kong-based economist at HSBC Holdings Plc., said before the
announcement. “The next move will likely be a 25-basis-point
hike in the third quarter of 2014 when the global economy picks
up again.”  The won rose about 2.8 percent against the dollar over the
past month, bucking a sell-off in some other Asian currencies
that pushed the India rupee down 3.3 percent and the Indonesia
rupiah down about 9.1 percent.  Overseas investors bought a net 3 trillion won ($2.7
billion) in stocks and bonds in July, the most since February,
according to the Financial Supervisory Service. August saw net
outflows worth 536 billion won. Foreign investors bought more
local equities than they sold for the 14th straight day on Sept.
11.  Stimulus  President Park Geun Hye introduced a 17.3 trillion won
extra budget in May, the same month Governor Kim delivered a
surprise interest rate cut, seeking to revive an economy that
grew 2 percent in 2012, the least in three years.  Gross domestic product expanded 1.1 percent in the second
quarter from the preceding three months, the most in more than
two years, central bank data showed Sept. 5. The economy will
expand 2.8 percent in 2013 and 4 percent next year, which would
be the fastest since 2010, the central bank forecasts.  Exports, which account for around half of GDP, jumped 7.7
percent in August from a year earlier, the most since January,
official data show.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Samsung Electronics
Co. (005930)  will be among the biggest beneficiaries from the U.S.
economic recovery.  Consumer inflation eased to 1.3 percent in August, below
the central bank’s target range of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent
since June 2012. Inflation in May and June was 1.0 percent, the
lowest since 1999.  To contact the reporters on this story:
