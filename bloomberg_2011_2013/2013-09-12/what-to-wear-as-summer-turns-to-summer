Summer, by most measures, is over. But with temperatures in the New York metro area in the 80s and 90s, it doesn't feel like it. And because someone, somewhere, decided arbitrarily that after Labor Day shorts and sundresses and seersuckers were inappropriate, and everyone inexplicably decided to go along with it, dressing for the weather has become tricky. There are a few easy outs.  Unless you work with psychopaths, no one is going to be examining your dark summer suits to see if they're linen or cotton. Which is to say, as long as you don't show up to the office looking like Tom Wolfe, you can probably keep wearing what you've been wearing all summer. For those who might not have a range of  navy blue, summer-appropriate blazers , and might want to get a few new pieces of clothing for the fall anyway, blazers with blended fabrics (cotton/wool, wool/polyester, etc.) are lighter than comparable winter clothes but warm enough that you won't freeze if you wear them in December. Patrik Ervell, for instance, makes a  cotton/wool blazer  for $655. It's not formal, but unless you work in a bank, you should be able to get away with it. Stephan Schneider, an Antwerp-based designer, makes a  wool/ polyester/cashmere blazer  for $690 that looks heavier than it feels, though when a blazer is scraping up against the $700 mark, you'd kind of hope there's some heft behind it. Theory sells a  jacket made out of cotton, wool, polyester and a tiny bit of elastane  (a polite word for Spandex) for $535, which is sold separately from matching suit pants. There's another, perhaps more compelling choice: Sweat it out in weather-inappropriate wool blazers for another three weeks or so, then buy one or two of the aforementioned choices for 50% off once they go on sale. You might be a little uncomfortable, but with the money you save you can buy yourself one or two or fifty cool drinks in compensation.
