The U.S. Treasury’s sale of $65
billion of notes and bonds this week drew above-average demand
from investors who aren’t primary dealers, even as Verizon
Communications Inc. sold a record $49 billion in bonds.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury,  bought  20.6 percent of
yesterday’s offering of $13 billion of U.S. 30-year bonds, the
most since June 2012. The Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers
bought 41.7 percent, the least since July 2011, after averaging
46.8 percent at the prior 10 sales. The debt drew a yield of
3.82 percent, the highest since July 2011.  “The 30-year capped a series of successful Treasury
auctions,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “There’s a great
deal of uncertainty in the market about the near-term economic
outlook, the performance of risk assets in a tapering world and
a general risk aversion as the market moves into the fall.”  The  30-year bond  yield was little changed at 3.85 percent
in daily trading yesterday in New York, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices. It fell earlier as low as 3.81 percent, the
least since Sept. 5. The 3.625 percent security rose 1/8, or
$1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 2/32.  The benchmark  10-year note  yield was little changed at 2.91
percent, after falling earlier to 2.86 percent the lowest since
Sept. 4. Three-year yields were little changed at 0.88 percent.  Investors in U.S. government securities have lost 3.8
percent this year, according to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury  Bond
Index (BUSY)  as of yesterday. U.S. debt gained 2 percent in 2012.  Foreign Banks  At today’s auction,  indirect bidders , a class of investors
that includes foreign central banks, bought 37.7 percent of the
long bonds, the least since April, compared with a 38.6 percent
average at the past 10 offerings.  The $21 billion of Treasury 10-year notes sold on Sept. 11
drew a yield of 2.946 percent, the highest since June 2011. The
government auctioned $31 billion of  three-year  securities on
Sept. 10 at a yield of 0.913 percent, the most since May 2011.  Direct investors purchased 29.6 percent of the 10-year
notes, the most since March, compared with an average of 21.5
percent at the 10 previous auctions. At the  three-year  note
sale, they bought 20 percent, also the highest share since
March, versus a 19 percent average at the previous 10 offerings.  Overall demand for the securities auctioned this week
increased above last month’s levels. The bid-to-cover ratio for
the  30-year bonds , which gauges demand by comparing total bids
with the amount of securities offered, was 2.40, compared with
2.11 for the August sale, which was the least since August 2011.
The average at the past 10 sales was 2.51.  ‘Great Week’  The bid-to-cover ratio for the 10-year note rose to 2.86,
from 2.45 in August, and compared with a 2.73 average at the
past 10 sales. For the  three-year  security, it was 3.29, up from
3.21 the month before, and compared with an average of 3.36 at
the previous 10 offerings.  “It was a great week for U.S. bond supply because we had a
lot of corporate deals, including a record-size Verizon deal
that proceeded to rally after pricing,” CRT’s Lyngen said.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  sold an unprecedented $49
billion of bonds yesterday, including $11 billion of 10-year
securities at a yield that’s 225 basis points more than
comparable-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield on the Treasury notes were the highest at
an auction since a June 2011 sale of comparable maturity
securities.  Investors have bid $2.88 for each dollar of the $1.508
trillion in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this
year, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
down from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
