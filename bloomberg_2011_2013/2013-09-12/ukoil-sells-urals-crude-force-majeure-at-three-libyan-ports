BP Plc failed to buy North Sea
Forties crude at a higher price than yesterday. OAO Lukoil sold
Russian Urals blend in Northwest Europe at a larger discount to
Dated Brent.  Libya  declared force majeure on crude exports from
Mellitah, Hariga and Zawiya terminals because of continued
strikes, according to a statement from state-owned National Oil
Corp. The restriction doesn’t apply to oil products imports.  Exxon Mobil Corp. will load the first cargo of Kashagan
crude on Oct. 30 from the CPC Black Sea terminal, according to a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg and two traders with
knowledge of the project.  North Sea  BP bid Forties for Sept. 26 to Sept. 28 loading at 95 cents
a barrel more than Dated Brent, according to a Bloomberg survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window.
This compares with a premium of 80 cents for a bid it withdrew
yesterday.  Brent for October settlement traded at $112.47 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $111.78 from the previous session. The November
contract was at $111.29, a discount of $1.18 to October.  ConocoPhillips will conduct repairs on the Ekofisk 2/4 J
oil platform within the next week, which will cause a partial
halt to production, Kris Sava, a Houston-based company official,
said in an e-mailed response to questions today, without giving
details about the duration or how much output will be affected.  Maintenance at  North Sea  Kinneil processing plant will last
two weeks longer than planned and end on Oct. 1, three people
with knowledge of the works said, asking not to be identified
because information is confidential. Kinneil processes crude
from the Forties pipeline before it is sent to Hound Point for
export. BP officials in Aberdeen didn’t reply to a voice mail or
an e-mail seeking comment.  Urals/Mediterranean  Lukoil sold 100,000 metric tons of Urals for Sept. 23 to
Sept. 27 to Vitol Group at $1.10 a barrels less than Dated Brent
delivered to Rotterdam, according to the survey. The discount is
15 cents wider than its offer yesterday.  Eni SpA didn’t manage to find buyers for the blend for Oct.
1 to Oct. 5 loading at a discount of 80 cents to Dated Brent,
the survey showed.  Total SA (FP)  failed to sell 80,000 tons of Urals for Sept. 26
to Sept. 30 loading for a second day even after it lowered its
offer by 15 cents to a discount of 25 cents a barrel to Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed.  The 93,500 ton Kashagan crude shipment will be shared
between Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, according to the
program. This will be the first time that crude from the
Kashagan oil field in Kazakh waters is exported via the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium terminal, the traders said, asking not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  CPC, operator of the only oil-export link in  Russia  that
has shared foreign ownership, is scheduled to keep October crude
exports from the Black Sea next month at 659,197 barrels a day,
little changed from 664,724 barrels a day in September. Loadings
will be the lowest since March.  The preliminary October program comprises nine cargoes of
134,000 to 135,500 tons each and 17 consignments of 85,000 to
93,500 tons, according to the document.  OAO Rosneft awarded its tender for Urals and CPC blend for
loading from October to March, according to two traders who
participate in market, asking not to be identified because
information is confidential.  The company sold 1.26 million to 2.52 million tons of Urals
in 140,000-ton size cargoes loading from Novorossiysk in  Black
Sea  to Shell and BP, and 960,000 to 1.92 million tons in 80,000-ton lots to Shell.  For Urals from the  Baltic Sea , Rosneft sold 3.6 million to
7.2 million tons for loading from Primorsk to Shell, Eni and
Total, and 1.8 million to 3.4 million tons from Ust-Luga to
Shell and Eni.  Russia’s biggest oil producer also awarded as much as 1.62
million tons of CPC blend in 140,000-ton sized cargoes to
Trafigura Beheer BV and 540,000 to 3.6 million tons in 80,000-ton shipments to Total.  A 100,000-ton cargo, allocated to Lukoil, for loading on
Sept. 22 to Sept. 23 was added to the loading program from
Primorsk, said four traders who participate in the market.  Three free positions remained unused, they said. These
slots are for Sept. 25 to Sept. 26 from Primorsk, Sept. 22 to
Sept. 23 and Sept. 28 to Sept. 29 from Ust-Luga.  West Africa  BP offered earlier today 600,000 barrels of Nigerian Qua
Iboe for loading on Sept. 11 to Sept. 12 at $5.90 a barrel more
than Dated Brent delivered to Rotterdam, or at a premium of
$5.75 for delivery to Lavera,  France , according to the survey.
This is 10 cents cheaper than yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
