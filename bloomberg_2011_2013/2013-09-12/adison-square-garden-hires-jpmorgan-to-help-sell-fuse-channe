Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG) , the
sports and entertainment company that owns the namesake arena in
 Manhattan , hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. to explore a sale of its
music-TV channel Fuse.  “We have been approached by certain parties expressing
interest in Fuse and have retained JPMorgan to explore all
strategic alternatives,” the New York-based company said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Selling Fuse would let the company’s TV business focus on
its more lucrative sports networks, which broadcast New York
Knicks and Rangers games. Fuse could be worth $300 million to
$400 million in a sale, said Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie
Group, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on MSG shares.  The music channel, which reaches about 64 million
households, competes with networks such as  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s MTV and
VH1 and  Mark Cuban ’s AXS TV. Fuse charges pay-TV providers about
6 cents per month per customer, according to research firm SNL
Kagan. That’s far less than what popular sports networks fetch.  Shares of Madison Square Garden , which also owns real
estate and sports teams, rose 1.6 percent to $55.99 at the close
in New York. The stock has gained 26 percent this year.  The New York Post reported earlier on the potential sale of
Fuse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
