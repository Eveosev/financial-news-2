ANA Holdings Inc. (9202) , the Japanese
carrier whose fleet is dominated by  Boeing Co. (BA)  aircraft, will
decide soon on placing an order for 25 jets, pitting the newest
wide-body models of Airbus SAS and Boeing against each other.  “It’s getting close to the time we need to make a
decision,” President Shinichiro Ito said an interview in  Tokyo ,
where  Japan ’s biggest airline is based. He declined to elaborate
on when the order will be made. “The key will be what plane
matches our needs best.”  ANA choosing Airbus would mark a triumph for the European
manufacturer in a country where Boeing has enjoyed near monopoly
for decades. The ties between the U.S. planemaker and Japanese
carriers were reinforced as ANA and  Japan Airlines Co. (9201)  became
the first operators of the carbon-composite Boeing 787
Dreamliner, when commercial flights started two years back.  The new planes ANA will order are to replace aging wide-body aircraft, used in international flights, Ito said in the
Sept. 4 interview. ANA, the biggest operator of Airbus planes in
the country with 17 aircraft, will decide between the yet-to-be-made 777X model and Airbus A350.  Boeing is marketing the 777X as a successor to its 777 jet
and Chief Executive Officer  James McNerney  has said the
planemaker expects to have the aircraft in service around the
end of the decade.  A350 First Flight  Airbus’s A350 had its maiden flight earlier this year and
the first variant is set to enter service by in 2014, with the
largest model slated for late 2017. The planemaker has said the
A350-1000 will offer 25 percent better operating economics than
Boeing’s 777-300ER.  Toulouse, France-based Airbus has been gaining market share
in Japan recently as low-cost carriers lease its planes. The
aircraft maker has yet to sell wide-body jets to either ANA or
Japan Airlines.  ANA operates 17 Airbus single-aisle A320s, which the
Japanese carrier started flying in  1991 . The airline has a fleet
of 236 planes, with 197 of them being Boeing aircraft.  Japan Airlines, which has never bought a new Airbus plane,
has a fleet of  214  aircraft.  Japanese carriers flew 43 Airbus jets at the end of 2012,
up from 36 a year earlier, according to the  Japan Aircraft
Development Corp.  ANA and its affiliate Peach Aviation Ltd. are
the main carriers using the European planemaker’s aircraft. In
comparison, domestic carriers had 409 Boeing planes, excluding
MD-90s, up from 397.  Skymark Airlines Inc. (9204) , Japan’s biggest discount carrier, is
currently the only Japanese airline that has agreed to buy
Airbus wide-body planes, with an order for six A380s. The
airline is due to start operation of its first double-decker
next year.  Airbus is in discussions with Japan’s two biggest carriers
about an order for its A350-1000, three people familiar with the
talks said in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
