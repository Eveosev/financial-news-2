Beijing Enterprises Water Group
Ltd. (371)  will pay 955 million yuan ($156 million) to buy nine water
and sewage treatment projects in China from  Malaysia ’s  Salcon
Bhd. (SALC)  to add total design capacity of 1.25 million tons a day.  The projects are in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong and Fujian
provinces and have current daily operational capacity of 1.06
million tons of water and 90,000 tons of sewage, the company
said in a  statement  to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange yesterday.  The acquisition will “quickly” increase its water
treatment capacity in China, cementing its market-leading
position, the company said in the statement. Beijing Enterprises
Water is backed by the municipal government and has operations
in China, Malaysia and Portugal.  The nine target projects had after-tax profit of 91.1
million  yuan  in 2012, rising from 44.6 million yuan in 2011,
according to the filing.  Beijing Enterprises Water earlier this month completed the
1.35 billion-yuan acquisition of a pair of Standard Water Ltd.
units involved in 36 water projects in Chinese provinces
including Shandong and Shanxi.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
