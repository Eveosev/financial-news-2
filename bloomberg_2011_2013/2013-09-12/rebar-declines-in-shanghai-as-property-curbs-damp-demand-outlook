Steel reinforcement-bar futures
fell for a third day in  Shanghai  on concern that more efforts to
rein in excessive investment in Chinese property projects will
weaken demand.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined as much as 0.3 percent to 3,717  yuan  ($608) a
metric ton and traded at 3,723 yuan at 10:34 a.m. local time.  Chinese banks including large state-owned lenders
temporarily halted mortgage loan in cities including Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen to avoid risks from property
“bubbles,” according to a commentary in the Securities Times.  “We’re closely watching for more policy signals in the
property sector,” said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing
Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin. “Although high production costs
are providing some support, rebar futures may have further to
fall in the short-term.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port was little
changed at $135.10 a dry ton yesterday, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The steel-making
ingredient reached its five-month high at $142.80 on Aug. 14.  The average  spot price  of rebar was little changed at 3,573
yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
