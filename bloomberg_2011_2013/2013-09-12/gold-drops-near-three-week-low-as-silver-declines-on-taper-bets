Gold futures tumbled the most in
nine weeks after a report showed U.S. jobless claims last week
dropped to the lowest since April 2006, boosting speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  will scale back fiscal stimulus soon.  First-time claims for  unemployment insurance  fell to
292,000 in the week ended Sept. 7, government data showed.
Analysts forecast 330,000. A Bloomberg survey on Sept. 6 showed
that the Fed will reduce bond purchases by $10 billion this
month. Gold rose to a three-month high on Aug. 28 on concern
that the U.S. would launch an attack against  Syria . Prices fell
0.7 percent last week as fears of a strike diminished.  “The momentum has been about the economy improving, and
today’s job data was another reason why people think the
tapering may happen,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “The war premium is also coming off.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 2.4 percent to
settle at $1,330.60 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest drop for a most-active contract since July 5.
Earlier, the metal touched $1,325.60, the lowest since Aug. 15.  Prices have dropped 21 percent this year as an equity rally
and low inflation eroded demand for the metal as a store of
value.  Syria Tension  Last month, gold gained 6.3 percent on escalating Syrian
tensions. The U.S. and Russia met today to discuss a plan for
the Middle Eastern nation to surrender its chemical weapons,
potentially averting a military strike from the U.S.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery dropped 2.1 percent to $1,442.70 an ounce. The
price fell for the fourth straight day, the longest slump since
mid-March. Trading was 39 percent above the average in the past
100 days, according to Bloomberg data.  Palladium futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$692.80 an ounce, advancing for the second time in three days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
