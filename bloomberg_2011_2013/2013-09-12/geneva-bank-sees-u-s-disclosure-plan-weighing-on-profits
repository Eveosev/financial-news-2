Banque Cantonale de Geneve , the
Swiss regional bank established in 1816, said costs from
considering to respond to a U.S. disclosure initiative on
undeclared accounts will “slightly” influence profitability.  The bank, partly owned by the canton of Geneva and publicly
traded on the Zurich stock exchange, is evaluating whether and
how to participate in the voluntary program announced by the
 U.S. Department of Justice  on Aug. 29 and accepted by the Swiss
government. The process incurs administrative and advisory
costs, the bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  Swiss banks that seek to avoid prosecution for fostering
 tax evasion  through secret accounts held by U.S. clients face
penalties of as much as 50 percent of the value of those assets
under the Justice Department program. The U.S. expects those
banks to disclose cross-border activities, give detailed account
information on American clients, describe other banks that have
secret accounts and cooperate with information requests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
