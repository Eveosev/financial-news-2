U.S. wheat inventories before next
yearâ€™s harvest will be larger than the government forecast last
month.  Reserves on May 31, 2014, will total 561 million bushels,
compared with 551 million (15 million metric tons) forecast in
August, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
report. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting 544
million, on average. The USDA is scheduled to release its final
U.S. production estimate on Sept. 30.  World  output  in the crop year that began June 1 will be
708.89 million metric tons, compared with 705.38 million
forecast last month, the government said. Global  inventories 
before the start of the Northern Hemisphere harvests in 2014
will be 176.28 million tons, compared with 172.99 million
predicted in August, the USDA said. Traders expected reserves to
fall to 172.75 million tons, on average.  Through yesterday, wheat futures on the Chicago Board of
Trade dropped 27 percent in the past 12 months to $6.48 a
bushel.  The USDA forecast wheat prices at the farm will average
$6.50 to $7.50 a bushel in the 12 months that began June 1,
compared with $6.40 to $7.60 a month earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
