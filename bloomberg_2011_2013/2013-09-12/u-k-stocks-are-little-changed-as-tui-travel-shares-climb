U.K. stocks  were little changed,
near their highest level in almost a month, as investors awaited
data on euro-area industrial production and U.S. jobless claims.  TUI Travel Plc (TT/)  advanced 2.1 percent after JPMorgan Chase &
Co. raised its recommendation on the tour operator.  WM Morrison
Supermarkets Plc (MRW)  climbed 5 percent after saying it will reduce
capital expenditure.  Trinity Mirror Plc (TNI)  fell 2 percent after the
police started an investigation into possible phone hacking by
former employees of its Sunday Mirror newspaper.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 3.21 points, or 0.1 percent, to
6,591.64 at 9:22 a.m. in  London . The equity benchmark  has fallen 
3.7 percent from a 13-year high on May 22 after the Federal
Reserve said it may start reducing its monthly bond purchases
this year. The broader FTSE All-Share Index added less than 0.1
percent today, while Irelandâ€™s ISEQ Index slipped 0.2 percent.  A Eurostat report at 11 a.m. in Luxembourg will show that
euro-area  industrial output  fell 0.3 percent in July, according
to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Production from factories,
mines and utilities gained 0.7 percent in June.  In the U.S., a Labor Department release at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington  will probably show  jobless claims  rose to 330,000 in
the week ended Sept. 7, from 323,000 a week earlier, according
to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The volume of shares traded in FTSE 100-listed companies
was 9.3 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
