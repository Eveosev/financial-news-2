Ray Dolby, the billionaire U.S.
inventor whose name became synonymous with high-end home and
cinema surround sound, has died. He was 80.  He died yesterday at his home in  San Francisco , according
to a statement by  Dolby Laboratories Inc. (DLB)  He had been suffering
from  Alzheimer’s disease  and was diagnosed in July with acute
leukemia, the San Francisco-based company said.  Through the company he founded in 1965, Dolby pioneered
noise-reduction and surround-sound technologies that are used in
movies, cinemas, personal computers and home theater equipment.
The Dolby logo -- two block-letter Ds, facing each other --
became a sign of audio quality, indicating the presence of Dolby
technology that reduced the hiss from cassette tapes, for
instance, or added a digital soundtrack to movies.  Tom Dolby, one of his sons, said in the statement that
while his father was an engineer at heart, his achievements
“grew out of a love of music and the arts.”  When Dolby Laboratories went public in 2005, its shares
surged 35 percent on the first day of trading. The founder, who
held more than 50 patents, received $306 million from the IPO,
and his 69.8 percent stake became worth $1.65 billion. As of
yesterday his net worth was $2.85 billion, according to the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  Stanford Graduate  Dolby Laboratories, with about 1,500 employees, had revenue
of $926 million in 2012, the bulk of it coming from technology
licensing.  Ray Milton Dolby was born on Jan. 18, 1933, in  Portland ,
Oregon. He received a bachelor of science degree in electrical
engineering in 1957 from  Stanford University  in  Palo Alto ,
California, and a doctorate in physics in 1961 from the
University of Cambridge. He went to work for Ampex Corp. as
chief electronics designer for the first practical videotape
recording system.  In 1963, he accepted a two-year appointment as a United
Nations adviser in India, and then returned to England in 1965
and founded Dolby Laboratories in London. In 1976, he moved to
San Francisco, where the company established its headquarters,
laboratories, and manufacturing facilities.  Two 1977 blockbuster films, “ Close Encounters of the Third
Kind ” and “ Star Wars ,” used Dolby Stereo technology and made
high-end audio an essential part of the films’ appeal.  In 1989, along with Dolby Laboratories executive Ioan
Allen, Dolby was awarded an Oscar for continuous contributions
to motion picture sound. He received an Order of the Officer of
the British Empire from  Queen Elizabeth  in 1987 and the National
Medal of Technology from President  Bill Clinton  in 1997.  Survivors include his wife, Dagmar; sons Tom and David; and
four grandchildren, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
