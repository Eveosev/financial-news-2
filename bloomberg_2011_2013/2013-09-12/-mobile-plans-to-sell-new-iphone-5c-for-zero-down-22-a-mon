T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) ,  AT&T Inc. (T)  and
 Verizon Wireless (VZ) , touting their new installment-plan approach to
mobile-phone pricing, will offer  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5C without
an initial down payment.  T-Mobile  will subsequently require  24 months of $22
payments, the Bellevue, Washington-based company said on its
website. AT&T’s $22 installment plan will  only last  20 months,
though its service prices start at a higher rate. And Verizon is
offering the 5C without a down payment and $23.06 per month over
24 months, according to its  website .  The debut of the new iPhones, due in stores later this
month, is putting a spotlight on the industry’s shift toward
more flexible installment purchases. T-Mobile, the fourth-largest U.S. carrier, was first to adopt the approach earlier
this year, seeking to stand out from its larger rivals.  Verizon
Wireless  and AT&T then followed with similar plans, though they
still offer the traditional method of subsidizing phones in
exchange for a two-year contract.  The higher-end iPhone 5S will sell for $99 down and $22.91
a month at T-Mobile, while AT&T will offer it for zero down and
20 monthly payments of $27. Verizon hasn’t determined an
installment plan price for the 5S yet. Verizon and AT&T will
offer the iPhone 5S starting at $199 with a two-year contract.  While the total cost of buying the iPhone through AT&T, for
example, is lower, T-Mobile aims to attract customers with its
service plans. The company charges $70 a month for unlimited
calling, text and data. AT&T, which no longer offers unlimited
data, has a starting price of $80 a month, with caps on calling
minutes and data.  T-Mobile shares declined 2.04 percent to $24.92 at 11:05
a.m. in  New York . Verizon and AT&T were up less than one percent
to $47.72 and  $34.52.  ‘Significant Moment’  “This represents a significant moment for people to
rethink who their carrier is and switch to T-Mobile,” said T-Mobile Chief Marketing Officer Mike Sievert. “People have been
waiting, either because they are stuck in contracts, or waiting
for the new iPhone.”  Sprint Corp. (S) , the third-largest U.S. carrier, will offer
both handsets starting Sept. 20 on a two-year service agreement.
The cheapest model 5C will sell for $99.99 while the 5S will
start at $199.99, the  Overland Park , Kansas-based company said
in a statement.  Apple unveiled the new iPhones this week, setting up the
first four-way showdown among major U.S. carriers offering the
device. T-Mobile became the last of the companies to get the
iPhone this year.  T-Mobile is working to rebound from years of customer
losses. In the second quarter, the company added 688,000 monthly
subscribers, surpassing the 551,000 that Dallas-based AT&T
gained.  Jennifer Fritzsche , an analyst at  Wells Fargo & Co . in
Chicago, predicts that T-Mobile will add 425,000 subscribers in
the third quarter -- double her original estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
