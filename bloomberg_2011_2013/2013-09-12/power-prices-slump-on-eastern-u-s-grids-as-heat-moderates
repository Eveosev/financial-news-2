Spot wholesale electricity prices
slumped from the East Coast to the Midwest as a blast of heat
faded, reducing the need to run air conditioners.  Prices on the three Eastern U.S. grids fell more than 70
percent after surging to a seven-week high yesterday in Boston,
 New York , and the PJM Interconnection LLC region, which includes
Washington and Chicago.  The high in Manhattan today may be 87 degrees Fahrenheit
(31 Celsius), 11 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
state College,  Pennsylvania . Temperatures in Central Park
reached 96 yesterday, the  National Weather Service  said.  Spot on-peak prices for  New York City  dropped $165 to
average $57.62 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 3 p.m.
versus the same time yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. Boston slid $267.90 to $69.39.  The average premium for New York on-peak power versus
Boston narrowed to $13.21 from $14.06 yesterday.  Power consumption in New York City may peak at 9,753
megawatts today, down 8.1 percent from yesterday’s high of
10,611 megawatts, which was the most since July 19, New York
Independent System Operator Inc. data show.  PJM expects peak demand to slip 12 percent to 126,057
megawatts from 142,507 megawatts yesterday, according to its
website. The operator of the 13-state grid issued alerts
yesterday and the day before for consumers in the mid-Atlantic
states and parts of  Ohio  to cut demand to help balance the grid.  Spot power for PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which includes
deliveries to Washington, fell $217.65 to $60.55 a megawatt-hour
during the hour ended at 3 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
