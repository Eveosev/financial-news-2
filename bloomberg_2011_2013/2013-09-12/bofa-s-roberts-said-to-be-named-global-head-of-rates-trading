David Sobotka, who became  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) ’s sole chief of fixed-income trading yesterday,
named Will Roberts head of global rates and structured credit,
said three people with knowledge of the move.  Roberts, 45, spent five years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
until 2008 and joined Bank of America in 2011 to work with his
former boss, co-Chief Operating Officer Thomas K. Montag, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the change
hasn’t been announced publicly. He will be in charge of
sovereign debt, swaps and rate-options trading.  Sobotka oversees a business that generated 13 percent of
 Bank of America’s revenue  in 2012. He becomes head of fixed-income, currency and commodities trading after co-leader Gerhard Seebacher said he would leave at the end of the month, the
people said. Sobotka reports to Montag, the former Goldman Sachs
trading head who became Bank of America’s co-chief operating
officer in 2011.  Roberts was head of structured credit at New York-based
Goldman Sachs and led counterparty  portfolio management  at Bank
of America, the people said. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based
firm is the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets.  The appointment is the latest change under Sobotka. He
named James DeMare head of global mortgages and securitized
products after Michael Nierenberg joined Fortress Investment
Group LLC, according to a memo obtained by  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
