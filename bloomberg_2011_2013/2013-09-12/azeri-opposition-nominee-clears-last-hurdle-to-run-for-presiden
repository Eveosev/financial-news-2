The Azeri opposition’s candidate to
challenge President Ilham Aliyev at elections next month was
registered after collecting the required number of signatures.  Camil Hasanli, 61, nominated last month by the National
Council of Democratic Forces, gathered 40,291 signatures,
exceeding the 40,000 threshold, the Central Electoral Commission
said today at a meeting in Baku, the capital.  Hasanli, a prominent historian and professor at Baku State
University, has the backing of a majority of the Caspian
nation’s opposition, making him President Aliyev’s main rival in
the elections, which are scheduled for Oct. 9.  Aliyev, 51, who succeeded his father in a disputed
presidential ballot 10 years ago, was nominated by the ruling
New Azerbaijan Party, or YAP, in July to compete for a third
term in office. The Azeri leader’s family has run the oil-rich
Caspian Sea state for more than four decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
