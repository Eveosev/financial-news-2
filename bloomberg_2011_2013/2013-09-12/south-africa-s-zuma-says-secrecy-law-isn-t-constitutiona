South African President  Jacob Zuma 
said a law to protect state secrets that Parliament approved in
April doesn’t comply with the Constitution and needs to be
redrafted.  The  Protection of State Information Bill  proposes making it
a criminal offense for members of the public to disclose
classified state information, even if it’s in the public
interest to do so. Opposition parties, civil rights groups,
labor unions and media companies have opposed the law, saying it
may curb free speech and stifle efforts to expose corruption.  “I am of the view that the bill as it stands does not pass
constitutional muster,” Zuma told reporters in Cape Town today.
“I have referred the Bill to the National Assembly for
reconsideration.”  State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele had argued that the
law was needed to combat espionage and information-peddling and
denied that its provisions were unconstitutional.  Zuma also criticized some parts of the bill for lacking
meaning and coherence. A stipulation that the National Director
of Public Prosecutions had to give written authority to
prosecute or investigate any offense committed under the law
that carried a penalty of imprisonment of five years was
problematic, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
