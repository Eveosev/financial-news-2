Futaba Industrial Co. (7241) , a supplier
of auto exhaust systems to  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , said a former
executive was arrested by Japanese police for bribing a Chinese
government official.  Takehisa Terada, 68, previously a senior managing director
at Futaba Industrial, was arrested yesterday for his activities
in China around 2007, the Okazaki City, Japan-based company said
in a statement today.  “The arrest is regrettable and we greatly apologize for
the issue,” Futaba Industrial said in the statement. The Aichi
prefectural police department didn’t immediately respond to
faxed queries on Terada’s arrest.  Terada resigned in March 2009 after giving “inappropriate
financial support” to Business Design Laboratory, a Japanese
company that researches and develops robots, according to
Futaba.  The Japanese company makes car mufflers and fuel tanks, and
has six production facilities in  China , according to its
 website .  Futaba Industrial slid as much as 1 percent to 398 yen in
Tokyo trading, while the Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 0.3
percent as of the midday break.  To contact the reporter on this story:
