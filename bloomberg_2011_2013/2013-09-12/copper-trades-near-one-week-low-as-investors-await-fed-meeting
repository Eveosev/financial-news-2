Copper fell to the lowest level in
almost a week as investors awaited the outcome of the U.S.
Federal Reserve’s meeting next week. Nickel also dropped.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange declined as much as 0.5 percent to $7,138 a metric ton,
the lowest since Sept. 6, and was at $7,142.75 a ton at 10:26
a.m. in  Shanghai . The metal has fallen 10 percent this year.  The Fed will decide to cut its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases this month, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13. The Federal Open Market
Committee holds a two-day meeting on Sept. 17-18.  “The market will remain volatile until the Fed decision
comes next week,” said Xiong Dabiao, an analyst at Minmetals
Futures Co. in Shanghai. “Since the odds are pretty fair that
the Fed will taper off its stimulus, investors are hesitant to
raise their bets on  China ’s recovery.”  Copper earlier rose as much as 0.2 percent amid signs of an
economic recovery in China, the world’s biggest metal consumer.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch today raised its 2013 growth
forecast for China to 7.7 percent from 7.6 percent. A Chinese
manufacturing gauge rose to a 16-month high in August.  Copper for delivery in December declined 0.7 percent to
51,700  yuan  ($8,450) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Metal for delivery in December was little changed to $3.2525 a
pound on the Comex in New York.  On the LME, aluminum, lead and zinc rose.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
