Tin is poised to advance for a
third straight month to the highest level since January,
according to  technical analysis  by Trading Central SA.  Moving averages signal that futures in  London  will climb to
$25,250 a metric ton, matching this year’s high on Jan. 17, said
Ludwig Garric, head of commodity research at the Paris-based
company, who correctly predicted in May a slump in nickel to a
four-year low.  “The near-term outlook favors the bull camp,” Garric said
in an e-mail yesterday. “Prices have been making successive
higher-highs and higher-lows since July. In addition, the 20-day
moving average has crossed above the 50-day moving average and
both are heading higher, signaling a bullish trend.”  The metal, used in everything from televisions to
smartphones, gained 7.9 percent in the two months through Aug.
30 and reached a five-month high on Sept. 9 amid concerns that
new trading rules will curb shipments from  Indonesia , which
accounts for 40 percent of global supply. Futures traded $22,425
a ton on the London Metal Exchange today.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts use charts of
trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Moving averages point to changes
in price trends. When the 20-day average breaks above the 50-day
average, for example, the move suggests that prices may rise,
and vice versa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
