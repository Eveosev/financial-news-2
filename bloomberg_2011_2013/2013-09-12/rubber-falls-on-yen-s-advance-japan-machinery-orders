Rubber futures in  Tokyo  dropped to
the lowest price in almost two weeks as the strengthening
Japanese currency reduced the appeal of yen-based contracts and
as Japan’s machinery orders trailed estimates.  The contract for February delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange fell as much as 1.6 percent 278.5 yen a kilogram
($2,799 a metric ton), the lowest level since Sept. 2. Futures
traded at 280 yen at 12:55 p.m. local time, bringing this year’s
drop to 7.4 percent.  The yen gained against the dollar for a second day as
traders speculated whether the  U.S. economy  is strong enough for
the  Federal Reserve  to decide as early as next week to start
reducing stimulus. Machinery orders rose 6.5 percent in July
after climbing 4.9 percent in June, the Japanese government
said. That missed economist estimates for 7.7 percent growth.  “A strong yen is negative for the rubber market,” said
Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research company Market Risk
Advisory Co. in Tokyo. “The weaker machinery data raised
concern that rubber demand will decline.”  The Fed will decide to cut its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases this month, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13. The  Federal Open Market
Committee  holds a two-day meeting on Sept. 17-18.  Japan’s vehicle manufacturing fell 14 percent in July from
the previous month, today’s government data showed.  The contract for January delivery in Shanghai fell 1.2
percent to 20,480  yuan  ($3,347) a ton. Thai rubber free-on-board
was unchanged at 86.15 baht ($2.72) a kilogram yesterday,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
