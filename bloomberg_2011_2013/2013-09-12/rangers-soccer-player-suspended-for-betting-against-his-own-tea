Rangers midfielder Ian Black was
suspended and fined by the  Scottish Football Association  for
breaking gambling rules, including betting against his own
soccer team.  The offenses took place between March 2006 and July 2013
during which time Black also played for Inverness Caledonian
Thistle and Hearts.  After a disciplinary tribunal at Hampden Park in Glasgow,
the SFA said Black bet against his own team on three occasions,
and placed 10 separate bets in matches involving his club and a
further 147 on other games. It didn’t say which club Black was
playing for when he gambled money on his team losing.  The 28-year midfielder was fined 7,500 pounds ($11,900) and
will miss three games. The remainder of the 10-game ban is
suspended until the end of the season and Black will serve it
only if he commits further gambling-related offenses.  Black has scored three goals in 32 appearances for Rangers,
which leads Scottish football’s League One, two levels below the
Premiership He’s played once for  Scotland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
