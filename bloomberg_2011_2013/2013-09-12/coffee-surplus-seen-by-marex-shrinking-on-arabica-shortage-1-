The coffee surplus will shrink in
the 12 months starting next month as arabica heads for a
shortage, Marex Spectron Group Ltd. said.  The surplus will be 250,000 bags in 2013-14 compared with
an oversupply of 6.9 million bags in 2012-13, London-based Marex
Spectron said in a report today. Arabica will move from a
surplus of 7.25 million bags in 2012-13 to a shortage of 250,000
bags in 2013-14 and consumers will switch to using more of the
beans at the expense of robustas, it said.  “This demand shift in 2013-14 should put arabica into tiny
deficit and robusta into decent surplus,” Marex Spectron said
in the report. “The robusta surplus should grow from the middle
of calendar year 2014 as  Brazil  and  Indonesia  come on line with
new crops, both of whom harvest in April/May.”  Prices for both types of coffee declined this year as
traders anticipated more supplies. Robusta “could move into a 2
to 3 million bag surplus from the middle of 2014 onward given
normal weather,” James Hearn, joint head of agriculture at
Marex Spectron, said by phone today.  Vietnam  is the biggest
grower of robusta, followed by Brazil and Indonesia, according
to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Brazil is biggest in
arabicas.  Arabica coffee  futures dropped 17 percent this year to
$1.20 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Robusta futures
declined 8.7 percent to $1,756 a metric ton (79.56 cents a
pound) on NYSE Liffe in London.  Arabica’s premium over robusta fell to about 40 cents a
pound now from 87 cents in September. Consumers may switch 2
million bags of demand from robusta to arabica, Marex Spectron
said.  Cocoa grindings will exceed production by 161,000 tons in
2012-13 and be followed by another shortage of 134,000 tons in
2013-14, Marex Spectron said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
