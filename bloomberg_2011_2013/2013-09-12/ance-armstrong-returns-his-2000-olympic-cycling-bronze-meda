(Corrects fourth-place finisher in 2000 race to Abraham
Olano in final paragraph.)  Lance Armstrong returned the bronze
medal he won at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, almost eight months
after the International Olympic Committee voided his result and
asked for it back following his admission that he cheated
throughout his career.  Armstrong yesterday posted a photo of the medal on Twitter
while announcing that it was in the possession of the U.S.
Olympic Committee.  “I can confirm that the United States Olympic Committee
has received the bronze medal awarded to Lance Armstrong at the
2000 Olympic Games in Sydney,” Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman
for the Colorado Springs, Colorado-based body, said in a
statement posted on Twitter. “The USOC has made arrangements to
return the medal to the IOC.”  The IOC, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, in January
stripped Armstrong of the medal he won in the cycling time trial
and asked him to return the medal. The decision was announced
the same day that an interview with Oprah Winfrey aired in which
Armstrong said he used performance-enhancing drugs while winning
each of his record seven Tour de France titles.  The fourth-place finisher in the race was Abraham Olano of
Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
