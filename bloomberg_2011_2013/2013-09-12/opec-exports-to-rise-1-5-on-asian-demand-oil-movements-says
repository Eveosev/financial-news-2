The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will increase crude shipments by 1.5 percent
this month to meet rising demand from Asian refiners, tanker
tracker Oil Movements said.  OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil,
will boost exports by 360,000 barrels a day to about 23.87
million barrels a day in the four weeks to Sept. 28 from the
period to Aug. 31, the researcher said in a report. The figures
exclude two of OPEC’s 12 members, Angola and  Ecuador .  “All of the incremental increase in September is east-bound,”  Roy Mason , the company’s founder, said by phone from
Halifax,  England . “There’s refiner demand because in the
background things are doing well. Certainly, scheduled long-haul
arrivals into  China  are running well above a year ago.”  Brent crude  has recovered about 16 percent from this year’s
low on signs the global economy is recovering, and as conflict
and political disturbance in the Middle East and North Africa
curbs oil supplies. It was at $112.46 a barrel on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange as of 3:06 p.m. in London.  Middle Eastern shipments will rise by 2 percent to 17.51
million barrels a day to Sept. 28, compared with 17.17 million
in the month to Aug. 31, according to Oil Movements. Those
figures include non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on on board tankers will increase 1.2 percent to
480.58 million barrels on Sept. 28, data from Oil Movements
show. The researcher calculates volumes by tallying tanker
bookings, and excludes crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. It will next meet in Vienna on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
