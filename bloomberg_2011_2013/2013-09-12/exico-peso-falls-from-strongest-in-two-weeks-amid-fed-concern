Mexico ’s peso fell from a two-week
high as a drop in U.S. jobless claims fueled speculation the
 Federal Reserve  next week will begin to slow monetary stimulus
that’s fueled demand for the Latin American nation’s securities.  The peso fell 0.6 percent to 13.1269 at 8:43 a.m. in Mexico
City after closing yesterday at the highest since Aug. 23.
Yields on peso bonds maturing in 2024 fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, today to 6.27 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  While a U.S. Labor Department spokesman said work on
computer systems in two states played a role in the claims drop,
the data surprised the market, according to  Ramon Cordova , a
trader at Banco Base SA. Speculation the Fed will reduce its $85
billion in monthly bond purchases has fueled a global selloff in
emerging-market assets.  “It caught the market by surprise, somewhat
uncomfortably,” Cordova said in an e-mailed response to
questions.  First-time claims for U.S. unemployment insurance fell by
31,000 to 292,000 in the week ended Sept. 7, which also included
the Labor Day holiday, the report today from  Washington  showed.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for 330,000
applications.  The peso has declined 3.2 percent in the past month, the
most among major Latin American currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
