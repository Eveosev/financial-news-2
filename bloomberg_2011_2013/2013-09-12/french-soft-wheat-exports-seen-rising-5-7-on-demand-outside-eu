France ’s soft-wheat exports, the
European Union’s largest, may rise 5.7 percent as demand from
clients including  Algeria  and Egypt is expected to make up for
slower sales in  Europe , according to crop office FranceAgriMer.  Shipments of the grain may climb to 18.2 million metric
tons in the 2013-14 season from 17.2 million tons the previous
crop year, according to a balance sheet published yesterday by
the Montreuil-sous-Bois, France-based office.  The EU has issued export licenses for 4.47 million tons of
soft wheat since July 1, the fastest pace in at least 10 years,
boosted by a jump in exports from Romania. France may start
winning business from Egypt, the world’s biggest wheat buyer, as
 Romania  begins to deplete its supplies, according to Olivia Le
Lamer, head of FranceAgriMer’s arable crops unit.  “We take the view that on our traditional destinations we
won’t face a threat, and we’re confident on Egypt,” Le Lamer
said yesterday. “Romania doesn’t have an inexhaustible
exportable surplus, at some point France will take its place.”  Egypt bought 1.97 million tons of wheat between the start
of July and Sept. 6, with Romania accounting for 840,000 tons,
Ukraine for 590,000 tons and  Russia  for 540,000 tons, according
to FranceAgriMer. Egypt’s state grain buyer said Sept. 10 it
bought another 60,000 tons of Romanian wheat, a similar amount
from Russia and 115,000 tons of the grain from Ukraine.  FranceAgriMer forecasts French soft-wheat sales outside the
EU will climb 11 percent to 11 million tons from 9.91 million
tons shipped outside the 28-nation bloc in 2012-13. Exports
within the EU are seen slipping 1.5 percent to 7.07 million
tons.  Egypt Sales  France’s soft-wheat exports to  Egypt  might be as much as 1
million tons, according to Le Lamer. That compared with 750,756
tons shipped to the country last season, trade data show.  “The forecast for 11 million tons takes into account the
possibilities on Egypt,” Le Lamer said. “We remain confident
for the opportunities of French wheat in this market.”  Romania accounted for 910,912 tons of the soft-wheat export
licenses issued by the EU this season as of Sept. 3, up from
221,840 tons from a year earlier. That compares with 1.25
million tons for France, from 1.13 million tons at the same time
last year, data published by the bloc show.  The Black Sea country’s wheat is about 65 percent milling
quality, more than usual, according to Le Lamer. Romania’s soft
wheat production is estimated at 7 million tons, while domestic
consumption is 3 million tons, according to FranceAgriMer.  “The exporters are pushing wheat now because coming up
behind them is a corn harvest that will also be abundant, and
they don’t have the storage capacity,” Le Lamer said.  In addition to France’s sales to regular clients such as
Algeria, the country this season loaded 60,000 tons of soft
wheat destined for  China  and 120,000 tons for  Saudi Arabia , Le
Lamer said.  “The two surprise players are China and Saudi Arabia,
which come on top of existing markets,” Le Lamer said. “We
don’t know where it will stop.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
