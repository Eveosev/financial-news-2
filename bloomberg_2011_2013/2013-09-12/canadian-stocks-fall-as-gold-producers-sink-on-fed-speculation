Canadian  stocks  fell the most in
two weeks as precious metals plunged on speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve will taper stimulus when policy makers meet next
week.  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  and Eldorado Gold Corp. sank at least 6.2
percent as the price of gold slumped the most in nine weeks.

points, or 1 percent, to 12,701.05 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
biggest decline since Aug. 27. The benchmark Canadian equity
gauge has risen 2.2 percent this year.  “All across Canada you can see gold and the resource
sector are down quite aggressively today,” said John Tsagarelis, a fund manager with Manulife Asset Management Ltd.
in Toronto. He manages C$550 million ($533 million). “If
tapering happens, yields go up, the U.S. dollar strengthens and
gold sells off. Somebody was being very aggressive with gold
this morning. The Syrian situation is probably the story getting
the most headlines.”  U.S. Federal Reserve officials, set to meet Sept. 17-18,
are watching economic data to determine when to begin scaling
back the central bank’s $85 billion in monthly asset purchases.  The U.S. and Russia met today to discuss a plan for  Syria 
to surrender its chemical weapons, potentially averting a
military strike. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said
negotiating a deal must be a “two-way street” in which the Obama
administration drops its military threats and stops arming
Syrian rebels. Last month, gold gained 6.3 percent on escalating
tensions in the Middle Eastern country.  Gold Slump  Raw-materials stocks sank 3.5 percent as a group, leading

statistics showed today.  Reitmans Canada, a women’s apparel retailer, slumped 13
percent to C$8.03, the lowest since 2004. The company posted

close since June, after signaling potential asset sales in a
strategy update. The company has more inventory, particularly in
dry natural gas, than can be optimally developed, and must focus
its portfolio, Encana said in a statement.  “Encana appears to be back on the road to winning again,”
said Greg Pardy, co-head of global energy research with RBC
Capital Markets, in a note to clients today. Pardy upgraded his
 rating  for the stock to outperform, the equivalent of a buy,
from sector perform. “Encana’s efforts to re-engineer its
strategic game plan appear to be nearing completion sooner than
its target of year-end 2013.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
