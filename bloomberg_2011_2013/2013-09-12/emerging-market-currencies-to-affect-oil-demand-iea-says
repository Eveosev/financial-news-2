Oil demand growth in  emerging
markets  will slow in the second half of the year as the
depreciation of local currencies versus the dollar hurts their
consumption, the  International Energy Agency  said.  Oil use in emerging markets will increase 2.6 percent in
the second half from a year ago, compared with average growth of
3.6 percent in the previous five years, the Paris-based
organization said in its monthly report. It projected lower oil
consumption in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Peru, the Philippines
and Thailand.  As oil is traded in dollars, countries such as India,
Indonesia and Malaysia that subsidize fuel to shield consumers
are facing pressure to curb their support, it said.  “Over the longer term, governments will likely become less
capable of protecting oil consumers from price effects, as
 currency depreciation  makes subsidies increasingly burdensome
and ultimately unaffordable,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
