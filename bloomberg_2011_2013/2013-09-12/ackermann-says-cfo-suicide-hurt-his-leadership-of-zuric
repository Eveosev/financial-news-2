Josef Ackermann  said he resigned as
 Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN)  chairman because accusations that he
carried some responsibility for the suicide of its chief
financial officer would have compromised his ability to shake up
the insurer.  “The need for strategic and operative action at the group
was considerable,” Ackermann, 65, told reporters at a
presentation of a book on his career in Berlin today. “I hope
that at Zurich the momentum I began will continue and wish the
group much success.”  Ackermann, the former chief executive officer of  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) , said last month he was leaving Zurich Insurance after
members of CFO Pierre Wauthier’s family accused him of bearing
responsibility for the death. Ackermann, whom Wauthier named in
a suicide note, said today that the death “was surprising to
everyone” and “his blame of me is in no way justifiable.”  Zurich spokesman Bernd De Wall declined to comment on
Ackermann’s remarks.  Ackermann said that he will also step down as deputy
chairman of  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s supervisory board while keeping posts
on other boards.  To contact the reporters on this story:
