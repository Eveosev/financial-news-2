Brandt Snedeker birdied seven
straight holes to take a one-shot lead over fellow American  Zach Johnson  into today’s second round of the BMW Championship, the
third event in the U.S. PGA Tour’s playoff series.  Snedeker, who entered the event at Conway Farms Golf Club
in Lake Forest, Illinois, in ninth place in the FedEx Cup
standings, shot a bogey-free 63 and is 8 under par. He began
play yesterday on the course’s 10th hole and had a run of seven
birdies beginning on the 13th hole.  Tiger Woods is three shots back at 5 under after sinking a
23-foot birdie putt on his final hole to end a round of 66 that
included seven birdies and two bogeys. Woods is tied with South
African Charl Schwartzel as well as Americans  Steve Stricker  and
Kevin Streelman. Masters Tournament winner  Adam Scott  of
Australia is among four players a further shot back at 4 under.  Sweden’s  Henrik Stenson , the winner of the Deutsche Bank
Championship, leads the FedEx Cup points standings with 4,051
points. Woods is second, 14 points behind, followed by Scott,
 Matt Kuchar  and Graham DeLaet.  The BMW Championship features the top 70 players remaining
in the playoff standings after the playoff-opening Barclays
event and the Deutsche Bank Championship.  After the BMW event, the top 30 in the standings will
compete for the FedEx Cup title and its $10 million bonus at the
Tour Championship in Atlanta from Sept. 19 to 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
