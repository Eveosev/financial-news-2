Soybean futures that have rebounded
from an 18-month low in August probably will rise 9 percent
further, according to a technical analysis by the Linn Group in
 Chicago .  Prices on the Chicago Board of Trade formed a flag
formation after reaching an 11-week high of $14.095 a bushel on
Aug. 27, with prices and volume declining. Soybeans are up 20
percent since this year’s low of $11.625 on Aug. 7 as drought
conditions expanded in the U.S. Midwest, reducing yield
prospects for a crop farmers will start harvesting this month.
After soybeans closed yesterday at $13.96, a settlement above
$14 will signal a gain to $15.22, said Linn’s  Roy Huckabay .  “We have a smaller crop, and the chart pattern points to a
rally,” Huckabay, an executive vice president, said by
telephone from Chicago. “We should see an increase in buying”
from speculators and processors, he said.  Soybean futures for November delivery jumped 2.8 percent
yesterday, the most in two weeks, after the U.S Department of
Agriculture cut its forecast for the domestic crop by 3.3
percent. Soybean meal, an animal feed made from the oilseed,
rose to a three-month high, signaling the price of the crop is
headed higher, Huckabay said.  “The rally may extend to weekly technical resistance at
$15.34,” Huckabay said. “Higher prices may help to shift some
demand to  Brazil  and Argentina and encourage more planting in
South America.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
