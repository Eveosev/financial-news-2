Cape Verde  was stripped of a
victory in the final round of African qualifying for the 2014
World Cup for using an ineligible player, allowing Tunisia to be
reinstated to the competition.  Soccer’s world governing body FIFA said in a  statement  that
Fernando Varela played in Cape Verde’s 3-0 win over Tunisia on
Sept. 7. The victory allowed Cape Verde to win its group by one
point over Tunisia, sending it to the final qualifying round.  FIFA said its ruling came after Varela played instead of
fully serving a four-match suspension imposed for a red card he
received in a qualifier in March.  “The match has been declared to be forfeited and awarded
3-0 in favor of Tunisia, meaning that the Cape Verde Islands
will not progress to round three of the FIFA  World Cup  African
zone qualifiers having dropped to second place in Group B with
nine points while Tunisia finish first with 14 points and will
now advance,” FIFA said in the statement.  The Cape Verdean Football Association was also fined 6,000
Swiss francs ($6,463) for allowing Varela to play before he
served his full suspension. Varela had been banned for
unsporting conduct toward a match official in a game against
 Equatorial Guinea  on March 24.  Tunisia now goes into the Sept. 16 draw, along with the
other nine group winners, for the final round of African
qualifying. The five winners of the two-game series advance to
next year’s World Cup in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
