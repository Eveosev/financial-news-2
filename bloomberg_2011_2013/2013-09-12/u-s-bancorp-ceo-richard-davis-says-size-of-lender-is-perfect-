Richard Davis , chief executive
officer of U.S. Bancorp, the nation’s largest regional lender,
said the size of his company is “perfect” and that it intends
to be only in businesses where it can compete effectively.  “We’ll either be at scale, be getting to scale or get
out,” Davis said today at the Minneapolis-based bank’s  investor
conference  in New York. “One of the reasons we’re not big on
looking to double the size of the bank or pick up a bank of our
size in another part of the country where we’re not is because
we would much rather double down on where we already are.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
