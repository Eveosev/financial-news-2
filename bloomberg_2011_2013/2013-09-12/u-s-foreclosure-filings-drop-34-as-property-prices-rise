Foreclosure filings fell 34 percent
in the U.S. last month as first-time defaults dropped to the
lowest level in almost eight years and rising home prices made
it easier for distressed owners to sell,  RealtyTrac  said.  Default, auction and repossession filings totaled 128,560
in August, with one in 1,019 U.S. households receiving a notice,
the  Irvine , California-based data seller said today in a report.
It was the 35th consecutive month in which total notices
declined on an annual basis, with foreclosure starts plunging 44
percent, RealtyTrac said.  “The  foreclosure  floodwaters have receded in most parts of
the country, but lenders and communities continue to clean up
the damage left behind,” RealtyTrac Vice President  Daren Blomquist  said in the report.  Increasing buyer demand and climbing property values are
helping some troubled borrowers refinance or sell rather than
lose their homes to foreclosure. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of
property values in 20 cities rose 12.1 percent in June from a
year earlier. Last month, foreclosure starts totaled 55,775, the
lowest since December 2005, and fell on a year-over-year basis
in 38 states, RealtyTrac said.  Declines occurred in states with and without court
oversight of the process, with judicial states Illinois and
Massachusetts both falling 66 percent, Florida dropping 65
percent and  Indiana  declining 43 percent, according to
RealtyTrac. Among non-judicial states,  Colorado  fell 80 percent,
 Arizona  and Washington both decreased 65 percent and California
dropped 57 percent.  Repossessions Rise  Bank seizures rose 6 percent last month from July, the
third increase in four months, “a trend that will likely
continue into next year,” Blomquist said.  The 26 states with increases in repossessions from a month
earlier included New York, where seizures climbed 123 percent to
the most in close to three years, and  New Jersey , where they
surged 63 percent to a 31-month high. Repossessions rose 48
percent in Florida, 46 percent in Ohio and 41 percent in
Indiana.  Nevada had the highest foreclosure rate in August, with one
in 359 households receiving a notice, followed by Florida, Ohio,
Maryland and Delaware, RealtyTrac said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
