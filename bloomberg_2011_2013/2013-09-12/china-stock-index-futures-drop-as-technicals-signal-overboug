China’s stocks  rose to a three-month high, led by banks and brokerages, after Premier  Li
Keqiang  said he would accelerate financial reform.  Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. (600000)  surged 8.7 percent,

Shanghai index has rebounded 16 percent since reaching this
year’s low on June 27 as August data ranging from exports to
industrial output showed growth is accelerating and as shippers
and port operators rallied after the State Council approved
Shanghai’s free-trade zone.  “There’s a stocks rotation from ports to banks based on
expectations they will benefit from the free-trade zone,”  said
 Zhang Gang , strategist at Central China Securities in Shanghai.
“Li’s speech about financial reforms are bolstering the
industry. As banks take up a huge weighting in the index, the
gains get amplified.”  A gauge of financial companies in the CSI 300 Index, which
accounts for 41 percent of the index’s total weighting, rose 2.7
percent, the most among 10 industry groups. The CSI 300 climbed
1 percent to 2,507.46. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
added 0.1 percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index lost 0.4
percent in New York yesterday.  Banks Rally  The Shanghai measure is  valued  at 9.1 times its projected

reforms and the internationalization of the yuan while promoting
the currency’s convertibility under the capital account, Premier
Li said in a speech yesterday at the World Economic Forum in the
northeast city of Dalian.  The reforms are expected to take place in the proposed
Shanghai free-trade zone, which was approved by the State
Council headed by Li. The trade zone is part of the central
government’s plan to develop the city into a global financial
and shipping center by 2020.  Trade Zone  Citic Securities, China’s biggest listed brokerage, climbed
3 percent to 13.56 yuan.  Haitong Securities Co. (600837) , the second
largest, gained 4.2 percent to 13.27 yuan.  Investors should be selective in buying shares of companies
that will benefit from the Shanghai free-trade zone given recent
equity rallies and the prospect earnings won’t get a boost until

yesterday.  The Shanghai index’s 14-day relative strength index,
measuring how rapidly prices have advanced or dropped during a
specified time period, was at 80.9 today. Readings above 70
indicate a price may be poised to fall.  Metals Fall  Aluminum Corp., or Chalco as the biggest aluminum producer
is known, dropped 1.5 percent to 3.92 yuan. Its RSI jumped above
70 on Sept. 10. Jiangxi Copper, the largest copper producer,
declined for the first time in five days, losing 1.9 percent to
