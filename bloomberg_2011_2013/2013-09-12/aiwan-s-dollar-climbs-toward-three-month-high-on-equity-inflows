Taiwan’s dollar advanced toward a
three-month high after overseas investors boosted holdings of
local stocks.  Government bonds  rose.  Foreign funds bought more Taiwanese equities than they sold
on each of the last 10 trading days, injecting a total of $2.7
billion, as the  Taiex (TWSE)  index added 5 percent over the period. The
island’s  foreign reserves  rose to $409.4 billion, the world’s
fifth-largest, in August, data showed last week. Taiwan dollar
forwards fell the most in three weeks yesterday as the ruling
Kuomintang party revoked legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng’s
party membership and legislative seat on allegations he
interfered with the judicial process.  “There’s some hot money flowing from countries like India
to places with high foreign reserves like Taiwan and South
Korea,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “But if the conflict between the
legislative and executive branches affects any important
economic legislations, the economy may be impacted.”  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.4 percent to NT$29.705 as of
10:36 a.m., Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The currency touched
NT$29.651, just shy of the three-month high of NT$29.622 reached
two days ago. It was trading 0.1 percent stronger nine minutes
before the 4 p.m. close yesterday, and finished 0.2 percent
weaker. The central bank has sold the local dollar in the run-up
to the finish on most days since March 2012, according to
traders who asked not to be identified.  Forwards, Bonds  One-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
NT$29.657 per  U.S. dollar , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 4.08 percent.  The yield on Taiwan’s government bonds due September 2023
decreased one basis point to 1.7659 percent in when-issued
trading, according to Gretai Securities Market. The notes are
due to be officially auctioned on Sept. 14.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
