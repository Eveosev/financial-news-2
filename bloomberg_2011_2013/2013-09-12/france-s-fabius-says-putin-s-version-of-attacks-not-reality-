Russian President  Vladimir Putin ’s
claim that rebels were behind the Aug. 21 chemical attack in
Syria “is not the reality,” French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said.  “The reality is clear: there was a chemical massacre, it’s
the regime of Bashar al-Assad that has the chemical weapons and
that gave the order,” Fabius said in an interview today on RTL
Radio.  Putin said in a  New York  Times opinion article published
late yesterday that the attack was the work of the opposition.
The U.S., French, and British governments have released
intelligence reports blaming the regime for the attack, which
they say killed more than a 1,400 civilians.  “It’s a version the Russians have developed for a long
time, without any credibility,” Fabius said.  Fabius said “all options remain on the table” for  Syria ,
and it’s the “great firmness” of the U.S. and the French
threat of military strikes that led to the Russian proposal to
put Syria’s chemical weapons under international control.  Any such plan must be “rapid, credible, and verifiable,”
Fabius said in the radio interview. He said destroying a
stockpile as large as Syria’s “takes an immense amount of
time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
