Developers installed 832 megawatts
of solar power capacity in the U.S. in the second quarter, led
by large projects that sell electricity to utilities, a trade
group said.  Installation grew 15 percent from the prior quarter, with
flat results in the residential market and commercial demand
slumping 11 percent, the Washington-based  Solar Energy
Industries Association  said today in a statement. Utility-scale
projects increased 42 percent.  The U.S. will probably install 4.4 gigawatts of solar power
this year, up 30 percent from 2012, as demand increases for
residential rooftop systems and the pipeline of utility-scale
projects increases, according to Shayle Kann, vice president of
research in  Boston  at GTM, which wrote the report with SEIA.  “Distributed generation is the big story in the U.S. solar
market this year,” Kann said in the statement. “We expect
significant growth, especially in the residential sector, but
the future will be dictated by the increasingly-complex nexus
between the solar industry and utilities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
