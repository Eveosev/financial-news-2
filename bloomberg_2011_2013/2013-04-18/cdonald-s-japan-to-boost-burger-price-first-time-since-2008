McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) ’s  Japan  business
will raise some prices by much as 25 percent next month, the
fast food chain’s first increase on burgers in the country since
2008.  Hamburger prices will go up to 120 yen from 100 yen and
cheeseburgers will rise to to 150 yen from 120 yen in Japan in
May, McDonald’s Holdings Co. Japan Ltd. said in a statement
today. The hikes are part of the company’s plan to boost
profitability, it said.  McDonald’s is raising the prices after the Japanese unit
reported a 12 percent drop in operating profit last year. Fewer
discounts drove March same-store sales 3.6 percent lower at the
local business, the 12th consecutive monthly decline.  The restaurant chain is also raising the price of small
shakes to 120 yen from 100 yen, and some chicken to 120 yen from
100 yen. The price of small fries will come down to 150 yen from
a previous range of 190 yen to 230 yen.  The fast food chain has been testing the price change in
the Fukuoka region since January, and “judged the new pricing
took the balance between the customer satisfaction and our
profitability,” said spokesman Kenji Kaniya via phone.  “Our pricing policy is demand-based and not cost-based, so
it’s not because of increasing material price,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
