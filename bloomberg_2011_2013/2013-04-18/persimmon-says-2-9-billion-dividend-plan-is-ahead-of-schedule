Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the U.K.’s largest
homebuilder by market value, said it’s ahead of schedule on a
plan to return 1.9 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) to shareholders
and intends to pay an early 10 pence a share dividend next year.
The stock gained as much as 2.6 percent.  The payment would move up about 30 million pounds of
dividends that had been set for 2015, Persimmon, said in a
statement today. The York, England-based company said its board
will seek approval for the move at next year’s annual general
meeting.  The homebuilder in February 2012 said it planned to give
1.9 billion pounds of capital to shareholders over a nine-and-a-
half year period ending in 2021. The first payment of about 228
million pounds, or 75 pence a share, will be paid to investors
in June, subject to shareholder approval at a meeting today.  Investors had been set to receive the next dividend of 95
pence a share in June 2015 and today’s announcement moves part
of the about 287 million-pound distribution up by a year.  Persimmon in February said annual profit rose 56 percent as
the company sold more homes at higher prices. The company
abandoned high-volume homebuilding after the financial crisis
and focused on houses rather than apartments in urban areas to
increase margins.  Persimmon was up 2.4 percent to 1,132 pence at 9:08 a.m. in
 London . It’s the best performer in the  Bloomberg EMEA
Homebuilder’s Index (BEUHBLD)  this year with a gain of about 42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
