The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will reduce crude shipments this month as
weakness in the global economy constrains demand and refiners
finish maintenance, according to tanker tracker Oil Movements.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will curb exports by about 220,000 barrels a day, or 0.9
percent, to 23.54 million a day in the four weeks to May 4, the
researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The figures exclude
Angola and  Ecuador .  “It’s now demand-side risk that’s at last driving the
market,” said  Roy Mason , the company’s founder said by phone
from Halifax,  England . “We haven’t been in this situation for a
few years. OPEC hasn’t had to cope with anything but scarcity
for about five years. It’s a different world.”  Middle East shipments will decrease by 1 percent to 17.23
million barrels a day in the period, compared with 17.41 million
in the four weeks to April 6, according to Oil Movements. That
figure includes non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its growth forecast for
2013 on April 16. The world economy will expand 3.3 percent this
year, less than the 3.5 percent forecast in January, after 3.2
percent growth in 2012, the Washington-based IMF said.  Crude on board tankers will average 472.14 million barrels,
down 0.2 percent from the previous period, Oil Movements’ data
show. Oil Movements calculates the volumes by tallying tanker
bookings. Its figures exclude crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
