Azerbaijan  will send its foreign
minister to Israel next week for the first time since the
majority Muslim nation on Iran’s northern border regained
independence from the former Soviet Union 22 years ago.  A delegation led by Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov
plans to meet top Israeli and Palestinian officials on April
21-23 to discuss the Middle East peace process and bilateral
ties, the ministry in the capital, Baku, said today by e-mail.  Acting under Iranian pressure, senior Azeri officials have
in the past refrained from visiting Israel, one of the main
suppliers of weapons to the Caspian Sea nation, declining to
open an embassy in the Jewish state after Israel unveiled its
diplomatic mission in Baku 20 years ago.  Azerbaijan and Iran, which share a 756-kilometer (470-mile)
border, have been locked in disputes for the better part of the
past two decades. Iran has pressured Azerbaijan to cut ties with
Israel and Western nations and opposed the entry of companies
like BP Plc,  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  in
energy projects on the  Caspian Sea .  Tehran lodged a protest with Azerbaijan last month after
Baku played host to a conference of ethnic Azeri groups seeking
independence from Iran. Almost a quarter of Iran’s 75-million
people are ethnic Azeri, while Iran’s Shiite religion is shared
by two-thirds of Azerbaijan’s 9 million population.  To contact the reporter on this story:
