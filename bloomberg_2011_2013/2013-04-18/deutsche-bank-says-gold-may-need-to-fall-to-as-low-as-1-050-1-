Gold may need to fall to as low as
$1,050 an ounce to bring its valuation versus other commodities
such as oil and copper back to historical averages, Deutsche
Bank AG said.  Gold may have to trade ato $1,050 or $1,500 for this to
occur,  Michael Lewis , an analyst at Deutsche Bank in  London ,
said in a report dated today. “In our view, what had been a
reliable source of positive returns for the past 12 years has
ended,” he said.  Gold for immediate delivery was at $1,394.04 an ounce at
11:49 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
