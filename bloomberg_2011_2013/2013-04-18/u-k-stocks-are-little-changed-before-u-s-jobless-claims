U.K. stocks  were little changed,
following four days of losses, as economic reports in the U.S.
missed forecasts, offsetting rallies by  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  and
 Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD)   GlaxoSmithKline rose to its highest price since 2002 after
a regulatory panel recommended its lung-disorder drug for
approval. Vodafone gained 1.7 percent after  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  said it still wants to buy out the British
company’s stake in their wireless joint venture in the U.S.
Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. slid 4.3 percent, pacing a
decline by commodity producers.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  fell 0.5 point, or less than 0.1
percent, to 6,243.67 at the close in London, paring a gain of as
much as 0.5 percent as the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s general economic index missed forecasts. The
equity benchmark has still  climbed 5.9 percent  this year. The
broader FTSE All-Share Index added less than 0.1 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slipped 0.2 percent.  “The Philly Fed is indicating a slowdown in growth in the
manufacturing sector, which is taking away some of the recent
optimism among investors towards U.S. growth,” said Espen Furnes, a  fund manager  who helps oversee $75 billion at
Storebrand Asset Management in Oslo, in a message. “Overall,
investors are cautious ahead of the big wave of earnings coming
in the next weeks.”  Philadelphia Manufacturing  In the U.S., the Philadelphia Fed’s  index  fell to 1.3 in
April from 2 in March. Readings greater than zero mean that
manufacturing expanded in the area covering eastern
Pennsylvania, southern  New Jersey  and Delaware. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg had called for a
reading of 3.  A Labor Department report showed  initial jobless claims 
rose to 352,000 in the week ended April 13, from a revised
348,000 a week earlier. The  median estimate  of economists in a
Bloomberg survey had called for the number of people seeking
 unemployment benefits  to reach 350,000.  A separate release showed the Conference Board’s index of
leading indicators unexpectedly dropped 0.1 percent in March.
Economists had forecast the gauge, which measures the outlook
for the next three to six months, would gain 0.1 percent. It
climbed 0.5 percent in February.  GlaxoSmithKline climbed 3.2 percent to 1,658 pence. A panel
of advisers to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  recommended
that Breo Ellipta, which Glaxo has developed with Theravance
Inc., should get approval to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. The FDA will probably decide whether to approve the
treatment by May 12.  Vodafone Stake  Vodafone added 1.7 percent to to 192.5 pence. Verizon Chief
Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in a conference call his
company, which owns 55 percent of  Verizon Wireless , remains
interested in buying the 45 percent stake that Vodafone owns.
The second-largest U.S. phone company posted first-quarter
earnings of 68 cents a share, exceeding the  average analyst
estimate  of 65 cents in a Bloomberg survey.  Debenhams Plc (DEB)  surged 4.9 percent to 84.45 pence, its
biggest rally since Oct. 25, after the U.K.’s second-largest
clothing retailer  reported  fiscal first-half profit before taxes
of 120.3 million pounds ($184 million), in line with its March 4
forecast of 120 million pounds. The department-store owner will
pay an unchanged interim dividend of one penny a share.  Debenhams on March 4 tumbled the most since 2008 after
warning in an unscheduled statement that profit would miss
analysts’ estimates because snow in January hurt its sales.  GKN Sales  GKN Plc (GKN)  advanced 2.6 percent to 252 pence after the
supplier of parts to Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS airplanes said
first-quarter sales rose 9 percent to 1.89 billion pounds.  “We continue to expect 2013 to be a year of good
progress,” the company said in a statement.  ENRC (ENRC)  retreated 4.3 percent to 229.8 pence. The U.K.’s
Serious Fraud Office demanded documents from Dechert LLP, the
 law firm  fired by the mining company earlier this month, the
Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with
the matter. ENRC said on April 11 that it had hired Fulcrum
Chambers LLP to replace Dechert.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) , which owns a 26 percent stake in ENRC, slid
3.1 percent to 310.1 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
