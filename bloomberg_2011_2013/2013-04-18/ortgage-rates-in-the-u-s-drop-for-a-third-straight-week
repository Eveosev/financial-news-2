Mortgage rates  in the U.S. fell for
a third week, keeping borrowing costs close to the record lows
that have helped support a housing recovery.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.41
percent in the week ended today, down from 3.43 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based Freddie Mac said in a statement. The average 15-
year rate dropped to 2.64 percent from 2.65 percent.  The housing market is a bright spot in the  U.S. economy ,
which has seen only modest to moderate growth, the  Federal
Reserve  said yesterday.  Interest rates  near record lows are
spurring refinancing and purchases, while buyer competition for
a thin  supply  of homes for sale bolsters  prices .  The  Mortgage Bankers Association â€™s index of  purchase 
applications climbed 3.9 percent in the week through April 12 to
its highest level since May 2010. The  refinancing  gauge rose 5.2
percent, the Washington-based group said yesterday.  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent in November, according to  Freddie Mac . The 15-year rate
fell to 2.63 percent, also the lowest on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
