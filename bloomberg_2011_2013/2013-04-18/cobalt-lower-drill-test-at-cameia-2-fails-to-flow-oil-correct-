(Corrects spelling of company name in first paragraph.)  Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE) 
reported that test results from the lowest level drilled at its
Cameia No. 2 well off the coast of Angola didn’t produce
measurable hydrocarbons.  The results of the drill stem test don’t affect the
“commerciality” of the Cameia Mound Development Project, the
company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
