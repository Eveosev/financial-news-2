Eight thin-film solar plants using
 First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  modules built at a former Soviet military
airport in Germany received more than 150 million euros ($200
million) in bank financing, law firm  Norton Rose  LLP said.  Banks including  Bayerische Landesbank  and UniCredit Bank AG
provided the loans for the plants at the former Templin/Gross
Doelln airport in eastern Germany with a total capacity of 128.4
megawatts, Norton Rose, which advised the banks, said today in
an e-mailed statement. Total investment is about 200 million
euros, it said.  The eight plants, developed by Belectric Solarkraftwerke
GmbH, are already built and will be connected to the grid “in
the near term,” Christine Wolf, a spokesman for Norton Rose in
Munich, said today by phone. They use inverters made by  SMA
Solar Technology AG (S92) , she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
