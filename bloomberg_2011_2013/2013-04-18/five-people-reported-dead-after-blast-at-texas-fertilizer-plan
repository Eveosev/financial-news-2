At least five people were killed
after an explosion at a plant operated by West Fertilizer Inc.
in the town of West, Texas, according to KWTX.com.  People were trapped in buildings after the blast just
before 8 p.m. local time following a fire at the plant located
off Interstate 35 about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of
 Dallas , the Dallas Morning News reported on its website.  “We’re seeing some folks that were very seriously injured
this evening, unfortunately,” Glenn Robinson, chief executive
officer of Hillcrest Hospital, told  CNN . “They’re blast
injuries, orthopedic injuries,” Robinson said. “A lot of
lacerations, a lot of cuts.”  Several buildings were reported destroyed, a nearby nursing
home was damaged and people were trapped in a damaged apartment
complex, KWTX television said.  Calls to the Waco McLennan County Emergency Management
office weren’t answered. Messages were left with the after-hours
number for the Texas Department of Public Safety.  To contact the reporters on this story:
