     April 18 (Bloomberg) --Brazilian wind farms produced more
electricity last year than their owners were expecting, a trade
group said.  The farms’ average efficiency was 54 percent in 2012, 12
percentage points higher than forecast, Elbia Melo, president of
Sao Paulo-based Associacao Brasileira de Energia Eolica, said
yesterday in a telephone interview.  Wind-farm development is booming in  Brazil  as companies
seek to use the country’s strong, steady breezes to generate
cheap energy. The total amount of wind farms operating in Brazil
will more than double this year to about 6,000 megawatts, she
said.  Critics of “the sector were justified in their concerns
that the wind farms won’t operate at the level they promised,”
Melo said. “They’re going to operate at a much higher level.”  Abeeolica, as the trade group is known, conducted a study
of wind-farm capacity factors, a ratio of turbines’ electricity
output to their installed capacity, which gives an indication of
their efficiency, she said. The data for last year concerns
projects that won contracts in a government-organized auction in
2009. In August, the ratio reached 71 percent, more than double
the global average of 35 percent.  The projects produced about twice as much electricity per
megawatt of installed capacity compared to wind farms that were
built as part of the country’s 2002 renewable-energy incentive
program known as Proinfa, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
