Sinopec Engineering Group Co. , a
unit of  China ’s biggest refiner, has started gauging demand for
an initial public offering in Hong Kong which may raise as much
as $2 billion, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  The Beijing-based unit of China Petrochemical Corp. may
sell shares at 10 times to 15 times estimated 2013 earnings, the
people said, asking not to be identified because the information
is private. The company aims to start trading early next month,
they said.  Sinopec Engineering builds facilities and provides oilfield
services, according to Sinopec Group’s website. Wison
Engineering Services Co., which raised $239 million from a Hong
Kong IPO in December, trades at about  10 times  estimated 2013
profit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  An external spokeswoman for Sinopec Engineering declined to
comment on the IPO. IFR reported yesterday that the IPO may
raise more than $2 billion. Earlier this month people with
knowledge of the matter said Sinopec Engineering may raise about
$1.5 billion.  Citic Securities Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG are
among banks arranging the offering, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
