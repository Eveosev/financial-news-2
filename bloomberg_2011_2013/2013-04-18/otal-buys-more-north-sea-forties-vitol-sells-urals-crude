Total SA bought another cargo of
 North Sea  Forties crude at a higher price than the previous
trade, bringing its total to 11 lots since March 27.  Vitol Group sold Russian Urals grade in the Mediterranean
for the second time in three days at the same differential as
its earlier deal.  North Sea  Total purchased Forties from  BP Plc (BP/)  for loading from May 3
to May 5 at $1 a barrel less than the cash cost of Brent,
Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk crudes in June, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. That’s 45 cents higher than the deal between the
two companies on April 16.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days narrowed by 2 cents to a discount of 55 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $98.82 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London  at the close of the
window, compared with $98.07 in the previous session. The June
contract was at $98.75 at the same time today, a discount of 7
cents to May.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol sold 140,000 metric tons of Urals to Total at 30
cents a barrel less than Dated Brent on a delivered basis to
Augusta, Italy, according to the Platts survey. That’s the same
level as the previous trade on April 16.  The company also offered 80,000 tons of the grade at a 20
cent discount, without finding a buyer, the survey showed.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 30 cents to 20 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the least since Jan. 25. In northwest
 Europe , the  discount  was at $1.60 a barrel compared with $1.87
at yesterday’s close. That’s the narrowest since Feb. 12.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend dropped 5 cents to $3.07
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  declared force majeure on Bonny Light
exports after closing the Nembe Creek Trunkline in  Nigeria  on
April 15 to remove oil theft connections, the company said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd. (BPCL)  issued a tender to buy mainly
North or West African low-sulfur crudes for loading in the first
half of June, according to a document obtained by  Bloomberg
