International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , the largest computer-services company, plans to cut as
much as 14 percent of its French workforce, Agence France Presse
reported, citing a union leader.  The firings will total 1,200 to 1,400 over two years,
 Gerard Chameau , a representative of the French Democratic
Confederation of Labor, told the wire service.  IBM, based in Armonk, New York, is seeking to reduce
expenses as economic weakness in  Europe  takes a toll on
potential customers. The company is shifting resources to focus
on growing markets such as Africa that have increasing demand
for technology and consulting help.  Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman, declined to comment. The
company is scheduled to report first-quarter results today after
the close of trading.  Chameau didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail message from
Bloomberg News seeking comment.  IBM  slid  less than 1 percent to $208.53 at 12:28 p.m. in
New York. The shares had climbed 9.5 percent this year through
yesterday, outpacing the 8.8 percent gain of the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
