Carrefour SA, (CA)  France’s biggest
retailer, said sales in stores open at least a year rose
0.4 percent as persistent pressure in Europe was offset by
“good” performance in  Latin America  and stable sales in  Asia .  A 1.3 percent rise in first-quarter sales at like-for-like
international operations, excluding currency movements,
compensated for a decline of 0.7 percent in France, Boulogne-
Billancourt-based Carrefour said today in a statement. Total
revenue fell 1.3 percent to 20.8 billion euros ($27.1 billion).
Analysts predicted 20.9 billion euros, according to the average
of five  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Carrefour, which in the past year has dispensed with assets
in five countries, is investing in its domestic business as it
struggles to attract customers in an economic climate that it
has said is unlikely to improve in 2013. The company’s goals for
this year include improving its price perception, refurbishing
outlets and broadening its multichannel offering, Chief
Executive Officer Georges Plassat said last month.  “All three formats, hypermarkets, supermarkets and
convenience stores, posted a resilient performance in a
challenging economic environment and despite unfavorable weather
conditions,” Carrefour said in today’s statement of its
operations in France.  The  shares  fell 2.5 percent to 20.63 euros yesterday in
Paris trading, trimming this year’s gain to 6.6 percent.  Carrefour restated its figures for 2012 after dispensing
with assets in  Colombia , Malaysia, Indonesia and Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
