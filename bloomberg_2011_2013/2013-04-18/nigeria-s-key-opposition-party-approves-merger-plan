Action Congress of  Nigeria , the
country’s main opposition party, approved a plan to merge with
two parties and a faction of a third ahead of the elections in
2015, an official said.  ACN, as the party is known, will fuse with the Congress of
Progressive Change, the All Nigeria People’s Party and a
splinter group of the All Progressive Grand Alliance, Chairman
Bisi Akande said today at a convention in Lagos, Nigeria’s
commercial capital. The new party, All Progressives Congress,
will challenge President Goodluck Jonathan’s People’s  Democratic
Party .  “We’ve come to the conclusion that in the face of current
events in Nigeria, a merger is the way to go,” Akande told
cheering party supporters. “We will alter the national
political platform with the APC.”  The two biggest parties in the merger are ACN, whose
governors control most of the country’s southwestern states
including Lagos, and the Congress for Progressive Change, led by
the north’s biggest opposition figure, former military ruler
Muhammadu Buhari.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous state and biggest oil
producer, is almost evenly divided between a mainly Muslim north
and a largely Christian south. Buhari lost to Jonathan in the
2011 presidential election, garnering the most northern votes.
Jonathan is the third PDP president since 1999, when more than
15 years of military rule started by Buhari ended.  To contact the reporter on this story:
