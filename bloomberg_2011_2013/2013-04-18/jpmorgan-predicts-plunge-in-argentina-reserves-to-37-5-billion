Argentina’s international reserves
will drop to $37.5 billion as  capital controls  erode the
country’s trade balance, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  JPMorgan’s estimate of a $5.5 billion decline in central
bank funds this year assumes that capital controls will prevent
a pickup in private-sector outflows. Reserves dropped to $39.8
billion yesterday, below $40 billion for the first time since
May 2007.  “Capital controls threaten to exert an adverse toll on
expectations of economic performance,” JPMorgan analysts
including New York-based Vladimir Werning wrote in an e-mailed
research report.  Argentina’s merchandise trade balance will be $9.6 billion
this year, according to JPMorgan, down from a previous estimate
of $11.6 billion.  JPMorgan cut its 2013 “agro bonus” forecast, the
estimated increase in agriculture-related exports, to $4.8
billion from $6.7 billion. It projected soy crop output of 45
million tons, down from a prior estimate of 51.5 million tons.
The bank raised its corn output estimate for this year to 25
million tons from 24 million tons.  YPF SA (YPFD) , the  oil company  that the Argentine government
seized in April 2012, was projected to import $600 million worth
of fuel this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
