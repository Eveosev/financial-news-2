Spot wholesale power on the largest
eastern U.S. grid jumped to a one-week high after two Midwest
reactors and a coal-fired power plant in  Pennsylvania  were shut.  The benchmark hub price for the PJM Interconnection LLC
grid stretching from New Jersey into Illinois and North Carolina
rose for the second time in three days.  Exelon Corp. (EXC) ’s 2,238-
megawatt LaSalle reactors outside of Chicago automatically
halted after lightning caused a loss of offsite power, according
to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A coal-fired power
plant in  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE) ’s Penelec utility area tripped
offline at about 9:30 a.m., Genscape Inc. said.  PJM’s benchmark  Western hub , which includes prices from
Erie, Pennsylvania, to Washington, rose $1.80, or 3.6 percent,
to $52.25 a megawatt-hour from yesterday’s on-peak average, the
most since April 10, data from the grid operator compiled by
Bloomberg show. On-peak prices extend from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The
PJM grid covers an area from  New Jersey  into North Carolina and
Illinois.  “With the generation outages between yesterday and today,
the supply stack is definitely much thinner,” said Diana
Chiyangwa, a Boston-based power analyst for Genscape, which
tracks real-time plant operations. “The evening peak will
likely be more volatile” as demand increases.  LaSalle Units  LaSalle’s  unit 1  and  unit 2 , about 70 miles (113
kilometers) southwest of Chicago, were operating at full
capacity yesterday. The shutdown of the reactors drove
 Midwestern nuclear output  down to 14,350 megawatts, or 67
percent of capacity, the first drop in 10 days, according to NRC
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 13 states covered by the PJM grid will see widespread
above-average warmth today, WSI Corp. in Andover,  Massachusetts ,
said. The high temperature in Chicago may reach 73 degrees
Fahrenheit (23 Celsius), 13 higher than usual, and Washington
may be 8 above normal at 76 degrees, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Electricity consumption  across the 13-state grid will rise
to 92,551 megawatts at 8:30 p.m., 1.9 percent higher than
yesterday’s peak of 90,819 megawatts at 4:20 p.m., PJM data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
