Sibanye Gold Ltd. (SGL) , South  Africa ’s
second-biggest producer of the metal, closed at a record low on
speculation that profit will decline.  The shares  slid  6.6 percent to close at 9.25 rand in
Johannesburg, the lowest level since they started trading on
Feb. 12. The stock has slumped 22 percent this week, on course
for its worst weekly performance. The spot price of the precious
metal, down 17 percent this year, reached the lowest since
February 2011 on April 15.  “The spot gold market has a huge influence on the gold
miners,” Jacques Theron, a portfolio manager at Absa Asset
Management Private Clients, said by phone from Johannesburg.
“That is why the stocks are so deeply discounted.”  Sibanye was spun off from  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  in February and
comprises the Kloof-Driefontein complex, Africa’s largest gold
operation, and the Beatrix mines.  This month’s futures-price drop to as low as $1,361.10 an
ounce brings gold closer to the global average-production cost
of about $1,200 an ounce, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  The  six-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index is heading
for its worst week in four years, dropping 11 percent so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
