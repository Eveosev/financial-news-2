Hong Kong stocks swung between
gains and losses as the outlook for global economic growth
weakened and as mainland developers gained after  China  reported
rising home prices in March.  Miners including  Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) , the country’s biggest
producer of the metal, fell as commodity prices retreated. HSBC
Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest lender, slid 0.5 percent after
the International Monetary Fund said as much as 20 percent of
non-bank corporate debt in the weakest euro-area economies is
unsustainable. Mainland developers gained as home prices rose in
almost all Chinese cities in March, with Guangzhou-based
Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. adding 2 percent.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.2 percent to 21,610.14 as of
10:19 a.m. after falling as much as 0.7 percent. The Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies listed in the city
rose 0.6 percent to 10,359.28.  “The recent trend is for individual traders focusing on
individual sectors and stocks,” said  Ben Kwong , chief operating
officer at brokerage KGI Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The overall
the market trend is still weak because of the prevailing concern
about bird flu and the local debt problem in China.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
