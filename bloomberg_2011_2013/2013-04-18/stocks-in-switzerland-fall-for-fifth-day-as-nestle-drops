said Witold Bahrke, who helps oversee $55 billion as senior
strategist at PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen. “Markets are still
lacking direction, being stuck in a tug-of-war between global
growth fears and central bank stimulus.”  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies

shares to overweight from market weight. “We assume that the
first quarter was the low point,” Patrik Schwendimann, an
analyst at ZKB, wrote in a note.  Syngenta advanced 3 percent to 393.60 francs after the
world’s largest maker of crop chemicals posted a 6 percent
increase in first-quarter sales to $4.6 billion, meeting
forecasts. The company said its Brazilian operations helped
offset weaker demand in  Europe .  Givaudan Rises  Givaudan gained 2.8 percent to 1,150 francs. A gauge of
chemical stocks was among the best performing industry groups on

of losses.  Roche Holding AG , the world’s largest maker of cancer

worst performer on the Stoxx 600.  Sonova dropped 7.1 percent to 96.45 francs. Deutsche Bank
AG cut its recommendation on the largest hearing-aid maker to
sell from hold, citing the possibility of further costs arising
from the voluntary recall of an implant in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
