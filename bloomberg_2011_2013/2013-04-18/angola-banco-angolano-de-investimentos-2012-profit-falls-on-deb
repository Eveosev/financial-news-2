Banco Angolano de Investimentos SA,
 Angola ’s largest bank by assets, reported a 15 percent drop in
2012 profit to $180 million as bad debts rose and premium house
prices fell.  Loan provisions, administrative costs and taxes increased,
Luis Filipe Rodrigues Lelis, the bank’s head of corporate and
investment banking, said in an interview yesterday in Luanda,
the capital.  Non-performing loans rose to 7.2 percent last year from 4.9
percent in 2011 primarily because of lower prices for housing
which affected some developments, Lelis said. Premium housing
demand declined and those prices may fall as much as 5 percent
this year, he said.  Total revenue increased by 10 percent to $581 million last
year while net assets fell 9 percent to $10.8 billion because a
one-time $2 billion transaction in late 2011 skewed the
comparison, Lelis said. Deposits fell to $8.51 billion from
$10.5 billion for the same reason, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
