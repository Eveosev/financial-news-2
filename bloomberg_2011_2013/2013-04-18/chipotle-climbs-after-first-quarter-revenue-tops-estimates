Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) , the
Denver-based fast-casual dining chain, rose the most in more
than two years after first-quarter sales topped analysts’
estimates, helped by an acceleration of store openings.  Chipotle  jumped  12 percent to $366.25 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since Oct. 22, 2010. The shares have
increased 23 percent this year, compared with a 9 percent gain
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Revenue increased 13 percent to $726.8 million in the
quarter, the burrito seller said in a statement yesterday.
Analysts estimated $724.7 million, the average of 24 projections
compiled by Bloomberg.  Chipotle, which has more than 1,450 locations, has been
trying to attract customers and boost sales with more
traditional advertising, catering services and new food,
including Sofritas -- tofu with spices and roasted peppers. The
company, led by co-Chief Executive Officers Steve Ells and
Montgomery Moran, has said that it may raise menu prices later
this year.  In the three months ended March 31, the company opened 48
new restaurants, compared with 32 new openings a year earlier.  Net income in the quarter increased 22 percent to $76.6
million, or $2.45 a share, from a year earlier, Chipotle said.
Analysts  estimated  $2.13 a share, on average.  The chain, which introduced its first ShopHouse Southeast
Asian Kitchen in 2011, will open three more of those stores in
the coming months, Ells said during a conference call with
analysts. At ShopHouse, customers move along a service line and
customize their meals, similar to Chipotle restaurants.  Chipotle plans to open at the high end of between 165 and
180 new stores this year, Ells said.  The shares have  gained  10 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with an 8.1 percent increase for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
