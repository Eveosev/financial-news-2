Ivory Coast , the biggest producer
of cashew nuts in  Africa , will guarantee farmers get a minimum
price for their produce as the country seeks to increase their
earnings and expand domestic processing of the crop.  Growers will get at least 60 percent of the world price in
the 2014 season, said Vassiriki Konate, head of the national
producers’ association. While Ivory Coast already offers a floor
price, this season set at 200  CFA francs  (40 cents) a kilogram,
farmers have received lower rates of 100 to 175 francs, he said.  Slowing world economies led to rising inventories in India
and  Vietnam , where most of Ivory Coast’s harvest is processed,
the agriculture ministry said in a statement. Farmers got 125 to
150 francs last year, while the minimum price was 310 francs.  Some farmers, as in the past, may stockpile their crops in
the hope that prices will increase, Konate said.  While output rose 20 percent last year to 450,000 metric
tons, less than 5 percent was processed locally, the ministry
said. The West African nation aims to process 50 percent of its
production by 2015 and all of it by 2020, the ministry added.  The government will also set up a regulator and improve the
structure of the industry to increase the quality of production
and encourage investment in processing, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
