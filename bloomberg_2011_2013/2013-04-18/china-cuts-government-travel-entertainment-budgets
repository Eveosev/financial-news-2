China  will cut spending on business
travel, vehicles, and entertainment this year by 1.6 percent to
7.97 billion  yuan  ($1.29 billion) to crack down on wasteful
expenditure, the Ministry of Finance said today.  The government spent 8.095 billion yuan on the items last
year, according to a ministry statement today. Expenditure in
these three areas was 9.346 billion yuan in 2011, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported last June, citing then-Finance
Minister  Xie Xuren .  China’s plan to reduce spending follows a campaign by
President Xi Jinping to reduce graft and crack down on
extravagance at official events. The new head of China’s ruling
Communist Party told fellow leaders last November that unless
they address corruption, social unrest could increase and
undermine the party’s legitimacy.  Spending for entertainment purposes would face the biggest
cut with a drop of 64 million yuan, the  ministry  said in today’s
statement. The government will also reduce its budget for
official vehicles by 33 million yuan and trim spending on
official travel by 29 million yuan, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
