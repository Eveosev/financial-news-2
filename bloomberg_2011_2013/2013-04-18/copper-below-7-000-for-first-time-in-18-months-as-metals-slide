Copper in  London  fell below $7,000
for the first time in almost 18 months as data from Europe to
China, the biggest user, raised concern that demand is faltering.
Aluminum, nickel, zinc, tin and lead also retreated.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange plunged as much as 4 percent to $6,800 a metric ton,
the lowest level since October 2011, and was at $6,840.25 at
9:38 a.m. in  Shanghai . Metal for delivery in August was at
50,530  yuan  ($8,175) a ton, declining by a daily limit, on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange. The July futures contract on the
Comex dropped 3.1 percent to $3.1035 per pound.  European car sales are sliding to a 20-year low as demand
plunged last month in Germany. The  Federal Reserve  said
yesterday in its Beige Book business survey the U.S. economic
expansion remained “moderate.” China’s first-quarter gross
domestic product growth and fixed-asset investments, as well as
March industrial production trailed economists’ forecasts.  “After breaching key technical levels, copper is in a
downward trajectory,” Xu Liping, an analyst at HNA Topwin
Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
