Spain  predicted this year’s wheat
harvest will jump 31 percent on higher yields, after the
country’s third-wettest autumn this century boosted soil-water
reserves following a summer drought.  The wheat crop may climb to 6.65 million metric tons from
5.09 million tons in 2012, based on conditions as of Feb. 28,
the  Agriculture Ministry  reported on its  website  today. That
would still be below the 2011 harvest of 6.9 million tons.  Rainfall was 43 percent higher than usual in the September-
November period, followed by normal winter rain, the ministry
has reported. Spain was the European Union’s second-biggest
wheat importer last year after  Italy , buying 5.47 million tons
of the grain, EU trade figures show.  “Spain is one of those countries, like  Kazakhstan , whose
grain output seems to yo-yo around from terrible to fantastic,”
 Dave Norris , an independent grain broker in Harrogate, England,
wrote in an e-mailed comment.  The Iberian country had its wettest March on record this
year, with triple the usual amount of rainfall, the government
weather office reported April 2.  Spain’s soft-wheat harvest is forecast to climb 22 percent
to 5.65 million tons, while the crop of durum wheat, the hard
variety of the grain used to make pasta, may more than double to
995,400 tons from 442,600 tons, the ministry said.  The country’s barley crop is expected to advance 15 percent
to 6.88 million tons, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
