New World Resources Plc (NWR)  tumbled the
most in 20 months after saying it cannot confirm its 2013
earnings guidance as demand for coal falls and prices stagnate.  The  stock  of the biggest Czech coking-coal producer fell 12
percent, the most since August 2011, to 51.70 koruna, the lowest
close since it began trading in May 2008. Turnover on the shares
was 451 percent of the three-month daily average.  “The difficult trading environment has negatively impacted
the operating performance,” the Amsterdam-registered company
said today in a statement. “As a result, the 2013 full-year
guidance as announced on Feb. 21, 2013 cannot be reiterated.”  The company said in February it expected to sell between
9.5 and 10.5 megatons of coal this year, equally split between
coking coal used by steelmakers and the less profitable thermal
coal. Stagnating prices of coal and coke, coupled with the slump
in manufacturing and steelmaking, have damped first-quarter
sales, it said.  The average agreed price of coking coal for deliveries in
the second quarter increased 3 percent to 104 euros per ton,
while the price of coke remained flat at 246 euros per ton, the
NWR said in the statement.  First-quarter sales reached 1 megaton for coking coal, 1.04
megaton for thermal coal and 149 kilotons for coke, according to
the statement.  “NWR is a high-cost coking coal producer at the wrong end
of the quality spectrum in an environment where prices continue
to fall,” Bank of America Corp analyst Jason Fairclough said in
a note. He has an underperform rating on the stock.  The selloff cut the 14-day  relative strength index  for NWR
shares to 13 today. Readings lower than 30 signal in technical
analysis the asset may be oversold and poised for a rebound.  To contact the reporters on this story:
