FuelCell Energy Inc., (FCEL)  a U.S.
manufacturer of fuel-cell power plants, surged the most in three
months after saying sales in its second fiscal quarter will
exceed analysts’ estimates as demand grows.  FuelCell rose 6.6 percent to 90 cents at the close in  New
York , the most since January 3.  Revenue for the quarter ending April 30 will be $38 million
to $40 million, the Danbury, Connecticut-based company said in a
statement today. That compares with the $36.4 million average of
three analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company said demand for its power plants is increasing
in the U.S. and abroad, including a 14.9-megawatt sale announced
in December to Dominion Resources Inc. Posco Energy Co.,  South
Korea ’s largest steelmaker and FuelCell’s largest shareholder
with a 16 percent stake, placed its biggest order to date in
November, for 121.8 megawatts of systems.  FuelCell’s systems convert natural gas into electricity
through a chemical process. It expects production to reach an
annual run-rate of 70 megawatts by May 1, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
