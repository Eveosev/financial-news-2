(Corrects to show cargo was not destined for India in
first paragraph of story published April 18. Removes extraneous
fifth paragraph.)  GDF Suez SA (GSZ)  was scheduled to ship a
Yemeni cargo of liquefied natural gas to  South Korea , according
to ship tracking data.  The BW GDF Suez Paris, with a capacity of 162,524 cubic
meters, was scheduled to sail to Incheon in South Korea,
according to ship transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. The tanker loaded the supercooled natural gas at
Yemen LNG’s Balhaf facility and departed April 10.  The vessel was scheduled to arrive May 5 at  Korea Gas
Corp.’s (036460)  Incheon receiving facility in the northwest of South
Korea. It was located off Singapore as of April 20.  A GDF Suez Trading official in Singapore and a Kogas
official near  Seoul  didn’t respond to calls to their desk phones
and e-mails seeking comment.  GDF Suez,  Europe ’s biggest utility by market value, has a
contract to supply Kogas, the world’s largest buyer of LNG by
volume, with 720,000 metric tons of LNG annually from 2010 to
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
