Al Dahra Agricultural Co. from  Abu
Dhabi  agreed with  Serbia  to invest in the Balkan country’s
state-owned shipping company and develop a port on the Danube
river near Belgrade.  Al Dahra may invest as much as 40 million euros ($52
million) in Jugoslovensko Recno Brodarstvo AD, Serbia’s river
shipper, to renew and enlarge its fleet, gaining a 30 percent to
49 percent stake in the Belgrade-based company, according to the
memorandum signed today by Serb Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic 
and Al Dahra Managing Director Hamad Saeed Al Shamsi. The
investor will also acquire 43 hectares (106 acres) in Pancevo,
east of Belgrade, where it plans a 5 million-euro port, Dinkic
said.  Serbia signed the deal last month on Al Dahra’s takeover of
eight agriculture companies and on building fodder plants. Al
Dahra also plans a cargo facility at Belgrade’s Nikola Tesla
Airport, from which it will ship food products made in Serbia,
Dinkic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
