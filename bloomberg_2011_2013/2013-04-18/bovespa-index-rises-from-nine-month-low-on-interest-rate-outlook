The Bovespa index advanced from a
nine-month low after Brazilian policy makers raised borrowing
costs less than some analysts had forecast, spurring speculation
that monetary tightening will be limited.  Retailer Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de
Acucar led gains by companies that sell locally.  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  contributed the most to the advance as crude
rebounded.  Vale SA (VALE5)  slumped after its iron-ore production missed
analysts’ estimates for the first time in four quarters.  The Bovespa added 0.5 percent to 53,153.50 at 1:41 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo  after reversing a decline of as much as 0.9 percent.
The real weakened 0.8 percent to 2.0166 per dollar.  Policy makers raised the target lending rate for the first
time since July 2011, seeking to slow inflation levels
jeopardizing the economic recovery. The central bank’s board
voted 6 to 2 to increase the Selic rate 25 basis points to 7.50
percent from a record low. Eighteen of 58 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast an increase of 50 basis points.  “The market was waiting for a 25 basis point increase, but
there was some concern the central bank could be more
aggressive,” Lucas Brendler, who helps manage 5 billion reais
at Geracao Futuro, said by phone from  Porto Alegre ,  Brazil .
“The fact that two board members voted to keep the rate
unchanged fuels expectations that the current cycle of increase
might be smoother.”  Pao de Acucar rallied 3.7 percent to 108.17 reais.
Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, rose 2.4 percent to
17.58 reais. Vale fell 0.5 percent to 30.83 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
