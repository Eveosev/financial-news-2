Russia  declared an Estonian
diplomat persona non grata two weeks after the Baltic nation’s
prime minister visited the country for the first time.  Franek Persidski, Estonia’s consul general in Russia’s
second-biggest city of  St. Petersburg , has returned home, Minna-
Liina Lind, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, said today
in an e-mailed response to questions.  “It was a counterstep by the Russian side to a similar
earlier decision made by the Estonian authorities.”, Lind said,
without elaborating. Russia’s Foreign Ministry declined to
comment.  Estonia denied the visa applications of five Russians who
wanted to participate in a round-table event in the capital,
Tallinn, last month organized by the Gorchakov Foundation for
Public Diplomacy Support, the  Baltic News Service  reported
today.  Estonian Premier  Andrus Ansip  visited Russia on April 5 for
the first time since coming to power in 2005. He said afterwards
in an interview with the Eesti Paevaleht newspaper that
political and economic ties between the two nations had improved
to the best “in all history.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
