President Jeffrey Lacker said a further slowing in inflation
below the Fed’s 2 percent target may prompt him to consider more
stimulus.  “If I thought it was going to persist this low or even
fall further, I’d of course be giving serious thought to
providing  monetary stimulus  to get the inflation rate back to
2” percent, Lacker said today to reporters in  Charlotte , North
Carolina. “I don’t see that as a pressing need right now.”  Consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in February from a year
earlier, according to the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation,
less than the central bank’s 2 percent goal.  “Of course, if inflation looked like it was going to sag
further on a persistent basis, I would certainly consider
stimulus for the purpose of bringing inflation up to target,”
Lacker said. “I don’t think we are there now.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
