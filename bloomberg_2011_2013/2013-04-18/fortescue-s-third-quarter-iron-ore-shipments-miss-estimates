Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia ’s third-biggest iron ore exporter, said its third-
quarter shipments of the steelmaking raw material rose 61
percent, missing analyst estimates.  Exports climbed to 19.4 million metric tons in the three
months ended March 31, from 12 million tons a year earlier, the
Perth-based company said today in a statement. That compares
with the median estimate of 20 million tons from three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Market conditions in China remain strong during the March
2013 quarter supporting Fortescue’s confidence in the
development of the economy now and into the future,” Fortescue
said in the statement. “Despite steel inventories being at
seasonal high levels, current daily production of steel in  China 
of more than two million tons per day is matching demand.”  BHP Billiton Ltd., the third-biggest iron-ore shipper,
earlier this week missed analyst estimates after bad weather in
Australia’s Pilbara region, where Fortescue also operates, hurt
output. Fortescue is seeking to sell port and rail assets to cut
debt, as the company continues with a plan to grow export
capacity to 155 million tons annually by the end of 2013.  Fortescue declined 3.23 percent to A$3.60 at 10:53 a.m.
Sydney time. The shares have fallen 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
