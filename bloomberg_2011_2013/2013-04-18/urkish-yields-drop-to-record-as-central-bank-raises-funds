Turkish  benchmark bond yields  fell
for a third day to their lowest level on record as the central
bank increased the amount of funding it gives to lenders after
cutting interest rates earlier this week.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt declined four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.53 percent at 3:54 p.m.
in Istanbul, the lowest level on a closing basis for similar
maturities since at least 2005 when Bloomberg started tracking
the data. The lira advanced 0.3 percent to 1.7951 per dollar.  Turkey ’s central bank provided 1.5 billion liras ($835
million) at 5 percent in its one-week repurchase agreement
auction, triple the amount it provided on the same day last
week. The  overnight cost of borrowing  in the interbank market
fell for a fourth day to 4.79 percent, the lowest in a week.  The yield declines are “related to the repo,” Ugur Kucuk,
a fixed-income strategist at Is Securities in Istanbul, said in
e-mailed comments. “As the central bank eases the liquidity,
the short- and medium-term rates should approach 5 percent
level.”  The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by a more-
than-expected 50 basis points on April 16 and trimmed overnight
lending and borrowing rates by 50 basis points on an increase in
capital inflows. Yields on benchmark lira bonds fell 20 basis
points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
