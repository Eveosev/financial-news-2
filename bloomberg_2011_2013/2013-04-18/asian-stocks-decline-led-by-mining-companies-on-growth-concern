Asian  stocks  fell, with the
regional benchmark index set for its biggest drop in a month,
led by mining companies as commodities slumped on concern weaker
global economic growth will crimp demand for raw materials.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest miner, sank 4.3
percent in Sydney. LG Display Co., which supplies touch screens
for Apple Inc., dropped 4.8 percent in Seoul after audio-chip
maker Cirrus Logic Inc. reported an inventory glut that suggests
iPhone sales may fall short of expectations. Softbank Corp.,
Japan’s third-largest wireless carrier, lost 1.6 percent as a
rival’s bid for Sprint Nextel Corp. gained shareholder support.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped 1.1 percent to 135.85
as of 7:19 p.m. in  Tokyo , heading for its biggest drop since
March 18. All 10 industry groups fell on the gauge, which is set
for its third decline in four days after  China’s economy 
expanded less than economists estimated. The  International
Monetary Fund  this week cut its global growth forecast as  Europe 
sinks deeper into recession.  “Weak corporate earnings results and renewed concerns
about the global economy saw traders switch to a risk-off
mode,” said Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-based head of markets
research at Perpetual Investments, which manages about $25
billion.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 6.2 percent this year
through yesterday amid signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering and
as Japanese shares rallied on optimism the  Bank of Japan  will
step up efforts to stimulate the economy. Shares on the gauge
traded at 13.8 times average estimated earnings compared with 14
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.3 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yen Swings  Japan’s Nikkei 255 Stock Average fell 1.2 percent as the
yen swung between gains and losses. The benchmark last week
climbed to the highest since July 2008.  South Korea’s  Kospi index  declined 1.2 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index sank 1.6 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index dropped 0.8 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index lost 0.2
percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.3 percent. China’s
Shanghai Composite Index added 0.2 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3
percent. The gauge yesterday dropped 1.4 percent amid
disappointing earnings results by companies from Bank of America
Corp. to Textron Inc. U.S. stocks are poised for a “spring
break” that will bring losses to investors as economic growth
slows and corporate earnings weaken, according to  Jonathan Golub , chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS AG.  Commodity Prices  Raw-material producers posted the  biggest decline  among the
10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index as copper
futures headed for the lowest price since October 2011.  Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal,
fell 2.5 percent to HK$14.90 in Hong Kong.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the
world’s No. 2 mining company, sank 4.6 percent to A$52.07 in
Sydney.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., Australia’s third-biggest iron
ore exporter, tumbled 7.8 percent to A$3.43. The company said
its third-quarter shipments of the steelmaking material rose 61
percent, missing analyst estimates.  BHP sank 4.4 percent to A$30.65. The company said today it
will pay its income chief executive officer  Andrew Mackenzie 
less than his predecessor at a time of declining commodity
prices and revenue for the industry.  Japanese exporters dropped. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s
biggest carmaker, slipped 2.2 percent to 5,430 yen. Fanuc Corp.,
a supplier of industrial robots, slid 2.3 percent to 14,870 yen.
Camera maker Nikon Corp. fell 2.1 percent to 2,125 yen.  Apple Suppliers  Apple suppliers declined after Cirrus yesterday posted
preliminary first-quarter net revenue that missed analyst
estimates due to high inventories. Apple accounts for more than
90 percent of Cirrus’s revenue, according to supply chain
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  LG Display dropped 4.8 percent to 29,800 won in Seoul.
Murata Manufacturing Co., a supplier of capacitors, slid 2.3
percent to 7,920 yen in Tokyo.  AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (2018) ,
which makes speakers for the iPhone, decreased 3.4 percent to
HK$36.90 in Hong Kong.  Softbank slid 1.6 percent to 4,345 yen in Tokyo. Dish
Network Corp.’s $25.5 billion proposal to take over Sprint is
better than a board-endorsed offer by Softbank, investor Omega
Advisors Inc. said yesterday, joining billionaire  John Paulson 
in praising the bid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
