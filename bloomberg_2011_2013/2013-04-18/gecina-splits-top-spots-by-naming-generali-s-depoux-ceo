Gecina SA (GFC) , Paris’s largest publicly
traded office landlord, said Philippe Depoux will replace
Bernard Michel as chief executive officer. Michel will remain
chairman of the company.  Depoux, 51, will take on the new role on June 3, Gecina
said in a statement today. He had been a manager at French real
estate companies owned by Assicurazioni Generali SpA,  Italy ’s
biggest insurer, since 2008, according to the statement.  Michel has been Gecina’s chairman since February 2010 and
CEO since October 2011. In February, the Paris-based company
reported full-year earnings that beat its own forecast after
rental margins widened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
