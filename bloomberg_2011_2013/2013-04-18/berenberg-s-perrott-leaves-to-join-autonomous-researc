Richard Perrott, an analyst covering exchanges and inter-dealer brokers at Berenberg Bank, left to join Autonomous Research LLP, the independent research firm founded by former Merrill Lynch & Co. executives.  Perrott, who worked at Berenberg since February 2011, said he will start at Autonomous Research in  London  in the summer after a period of so-called garden leave. The University of Oxford graduate in maths and philosophy, who previously covered investment banks and exchanges at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., will initially focus on European exchanges, inter-dealer brokers and asset managers.  Autonomous was founded in 2009 by Stuart Graham, the former head of Merrill Lynch’s European bank-stocks team. The group was ranked No. 1 among the region’s bank analysts by Institutional Investor in 2006.  The London-based firm hired  Bank of America Corp .’s  Guy Moszkowski , who led coverage of financial firms at the lender for almost a decade, along with  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ’s Brian Foran to build the U.S. business. In  Europe , founding partner Manus Costello, who covered exchanges at Merrill between 2001 and 2004, leads U.K. banking research.  Perrott in 2009 correctly predicted that  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  would write down its purchase of Borsa Italiana SpA.
