The  Boston  Marathon’s official
finishing times will be released next week as race organizers
work to recover from the aftermath of the April 15 bombings.  While finishing times for most runners in the world’s
oldest marathon have been posted on the Boston Athletic
Association’s website, it has yet to address the times of
runners who were stopped for safety reasons.  “It is our intention to release those results on or about
Friday, April 26th,” the association said in a statement on its
website. “At that time, you will receive a link that will
provide you with the opportunity to pose questions regarding
that official time.”  About 10,000 of the about 27,000 runners who took part in
the 117th annual 26.2-mile (42-kilometer) race from Hopkinton,
 Massachusetts , to Boston don’t have official times. Finish line
operations were shut down after the 17,580th runner crossed the
line. Thousands of runners were stopped with less than 1 mile
remaining after two bombs exploded near the finish. An 8-year-
old boy was among three killed. Authorities have called the
bombings an act of terror.  Organizers said they will soon address the issue of getting
finisher medals to those runners who weren’t allowed to cross
the line due to the bombings.  “We ask for your patience as we work to resolve the final
results and times for these participants,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
