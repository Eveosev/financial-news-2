Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  hired former
WestLB AG analyst  John Davies  as a U.S. interest-rates
strategist in London.  Davies, who had been with WestLB since 1999, left its
successor, Portigon AG, earlier this month, he said today in an
e-mailed response to questions. Davies said he took up his new
position on April 15.  Standard Chartered spokesman Shaun Gamble confirmed the
appointment via e-mail today. Davies will report to Michael Trounce, head of local markets strategy west, Gamble said.  The European Commission ordered WestLB to cease operations
in June as a condition tied to the 17 billion euros ($22.2
billion) in aid the state-owned bank received from taxpayers
following the 2007 U.S. housing market meltdown. Portigon is
helping a state-owned entity sell WestLBâ€™s holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
