U.S. gasoline use fell in March to
the lowest level for the month in 13 years as weaker economic
growth reduced demand, the  American Petroleum Institute  said.  Gasoline deliveries, a measure of demand, dropped 2.3
percent from a year ago to 8.43 million barrels a day, the API
said today in a report. Total petroleum consumption rose 0.6
percent, driven by a jump in heating oil. U.S. non-farm payrolls
climbed 88,000 in March, the smallest gain in nine months, as
the jobless rate stayed above 7 percent, a separate U.S. Labor
Department report showed.  “Tepid growth and high unemployment are still burdening
the economy and holding demand down,”  John Felmy , the chief
economist at the API, said in the report. “The recovery is a
sputtering engine with a cylinder or two still not firing.”  Gasoline demand in the first quarter dropped 1.7 percent
from a year ago to 8.34 million barrels a day, the industry-
funded API said.  Total oil consumption rose to 18.3 million barrels a day.
Demand for high sulfur distillate fuel, used as heating oil,
jumped 37 percent to 395,000 barrels a day.  The increase in heating oil use was “driven by the
relatively colder weather in March,” the API said. Heating
degree days, a measure of demand, averaged 660 in the month, up
75 percent, or 283, from a year ago, according to  National
Weather Service .  Heating Oil  Strong demand for heating oil helped raise consumption of
distillate fuel by 5 percent to 3.89 million barrels a day in
March. Demand for ultra-low-sulfur diesel, the distillate used
by the trucking industry, gained 2.2 percent to 3.49 million.  Jet fuel consumption decreased 2.6 percent from a year
earlier to 1.35 million barrels a day. Demand for all other
oils, a category that includes liquefied petroleum gas,
increased 6.7 percent to 4.28 million.  U.S. crude-oil production jumped 14 percent from a year
earlier to 7.15 million barrels a day, the highest March output
in 21 years, according to API. Production rose 15 percent in the
lower 48 states to 6.57 million barrels a day and rose 1.2
percent to 574,000 in  Alaska .  To contact the reporter on this story:
