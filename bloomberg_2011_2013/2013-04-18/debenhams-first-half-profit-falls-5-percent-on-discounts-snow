Debenhams Plc (DEB) , the U.K.’s second-
largest clothing retailer, reported first-half profit fell 5.4
percent as snow disrupted purchases of winter goods, forcing the
chain to offer more discounts.  Profit before tax in the six months ended March 2 declined
to 120.3 million pounds ($184 million), the London-based
retailer said in a statement today. That compares to the 121.8
million-pound average estimate of eight analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The retailer will pay an unchanged interim dividend
of one penny.  Debenhams blamed snow that “severely disrupted” sales at
the end of January, forcing it to bolster discounts to clear
excess stock. The retailer is refurbishing stores, extending its
online offer and opening franchise outlets internationally to
offset stagnant U.K. retail sales.  “We made progress during the first half although snow in
late January meant we did not achieve the profit outcome we had
expected,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Sharp said in the
statement. “We expect to make further progress in the second
half despite consumer sentiment remaining weak and challenging
market conditions.”  The shares fell 1.4 percent to 80.5 pence in London trading
yesterday. The stock has dropped 29 percent this year,
underperforming the FTSE 350 General Retailer’s Index, which has
climbed 7.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
