World Bank President Jim Yong Kim
defended the Washington-based lender today, saying he doesn’t
see “even slightly a diminishing” demand for its services from
large  emerging markets .  Nations such as China keep coming to the bank with specific
requests, he said, citing a report that the lender is preparing
for that country for later this year.  The largest emerging economies -- Brazil, Russia, India,
China and  South Africa  -- say that the World Bank and
 International Monetary Fund  don’t do enough to address
underdevelopment and that Western countries exert too much
control over their management. The so-called BRICS are setting
up their own development bank that could help meet their
infrastructure deficit, which Kim said is expected to reach $1
trillion in India alone in the next five years.  “It’s true that the BRICS countries, many of them are
extremely well financed and have money, but they continue to
come to us for very specific reasons,” Kim said at a press
conference in Washington today. “I have no doubt in my own mind
about our continued relevance for a very long time.”  Kim also said the lender is working on several projects
with  Egypt  and, along with the IMF, is trying to help the
country remove subsidies on fuel so that it can spend the money
elsewhere.  “Every single one of the BRICS countries has an enormous
infrastructure deficit that simply can’t be met by a single
institution, certainly not the  World Bank  in and of itself,”
Kim said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
