Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  fell the most
in two months after an analyst at Detwiler said grocery and
apparel sales might be weak.  The shares  dropped   1.9 percent to $77.02 at 12:10 p.m. in
 New York  and earlier slid as much as 2.4 percent for the biggest
intraday decline since Feb. 15. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-
Mart had gained 15 percent this year through yesterday, compared
with an 8.8 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Analysts at Detwiler Fenton Group said today in a note that
they are seeing signs of deteriorating sales of perishable goods
at stores, suggesting Wal-Mart’s grocery business may be
weakening. The retailer also may have too much outerwear
inventory on hand, according to the firm, which has offices in
New York and  Boston .  Wal-Mart in February forecast first-quarter  profit  that
trailed analysts’ estimates as an increase in payroll taxes and
delayed refunds curtailed spending by its lower-income
customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
