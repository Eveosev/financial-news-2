Indonesia’s rupiah declined on
concern a proposal to increase gasoline prices for privately
owned cars will quicken inflation from a 22-month high in March.
 Government bonds  were little changed.  The proposal, which would raise gasoline prices by about 50
percent for privately owned vehicles excluding motorcycles, will
add  0.2 percentage point  to inflation, Santitarn Sathirathai, a
Singapore-based economist at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a
research note yesterday. Subsidized fuel consumption will exceed
the government’s target if there are no policy changes, Finance
Minister  Agus Martowardojo  said yesterday, adding the  budget
deficit  may be 2 percent to 2.4 percent of gross domestic
product in 2013, compared with a 1.65 percent goal.  “Curbing fuel subsidies will quicken inflation and weaken
the rupiah in the short term,” said Fahrudin Haris Prastowo, a
foreign-exchange trader at PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia. “Though
the long-term effect will be very positive for the fiscal
position.”  The rupiah slipped 0.2 percent to 9,725 per dollar as of
9:51 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It traded at a 0.2 percent premium to the
one-month non-deliverable forwards, which declined 0.1 percent
to 9,747, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Consumer prices rose 5.9 percent in March, the most since
May 2011, official data show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the rupiah derivatives was
set at 9,712 yesterday by the Association of Banks in Singapore,
compared with 9,725 on April 16. Today’s rate will be released
at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, fell 10 basis points to 5.84 percent.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 was rose
one basis point to 5.46 percent, after reaching a one-month low
of 5.45 yesterday, Inter Dealer Market Association prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
