The field-mice population in
central  Germany  has reached “critical levels,” threating to
cause damage to the upcoming harvest that could exceed last
year’s losses, farm lobby  Deutscher Bauernverband  said.  Field-mouse  populations are high in parts of Thuringia,
Hesse, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, with farmers finding 50 to 60
mouse holes per square meter in some fields, the farm group
wrote in an e-mailed statement today.  “Even the prolonged winter weather couldn’t reduce the
problem,” the lobby wrote. “The extent in parts of Germany is
already critical.”  Last year, mice caused estimated losses of 80,000 metric
tons of grain with a value of 16 million euros ($21 million) in
Thuringia’s Soemmerda district alone, according to the group.  Authorities should allow farmers to use “effective
products” if necessary, and spread of the field-mouse plague to
other regions should be prevented, DBV wrote, without providing
details on possible measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
