Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s second-
biggest bank, is in talks to sell its Eurohypo U.K. real estate
lending unit to  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  Lone Star Funds , three
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Negotiations are continuing and no deal has been reached,
said two of the people. The portfolio, made up of distressed and
performing debt, is valued at 5 billion pounds ($7.6 billion),
one person said. All three asked not to be identified because
the information is private.  U.S. investors such as San Francisco-based Wells Fargo are
targeting European loan books because the region’s lenders are
reducing their real estate assets to meet new regulations.
Commerzbank is winding down Hypothekenbank Frankfurt, formerly
known as Eurohypo, to meet European Union conditions for aid
from the German government as a result of the  European debt
crisis .  In December,  Lone Star  agreed to buy TLG Immobilien, a
company that owns about 800 buildings in the country’s eastern
states, from the German government for 1.1 billion euros ($1.4
billion) including debt.  Commerzbank, based in Frankfurt, Dallas-based Lone Star and
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo declined to comment.  The Financial Times reported the Eurohypo talks yesterday,
saying it would be the biggest sale of property loans by a
European bank since the financial crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
