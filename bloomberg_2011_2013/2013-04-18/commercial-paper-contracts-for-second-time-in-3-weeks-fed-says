The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  contracted for the second time in three
weeks, led by a decline in issuance from financial institutions.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
fell $6.2 billion to $1.016 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
The market has declined from a 17-month high of $1.133 trillion
in the period ended Jan. 16.  Commercial paper sold by non-U.S. financial entities  fell
for the first time in six weeks, declining $4.4 billion to
$232.4 billion outstanding, while the  amount issued by U.S.-
based banks  fell $3.5 billion to $298.1 billion, erasing most of
the previous weekâ€™s rise, according to the Fed.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
