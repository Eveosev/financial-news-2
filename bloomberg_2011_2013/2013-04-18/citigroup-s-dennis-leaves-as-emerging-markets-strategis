Geoffrey Dennis, global emerging-
markets equity strategist at  Citigroup Inc. (C) , departed the New
York-based bank at the end of March.  Dennis, who joined Citigroup after previously working in
firms including Deutsche Bank AG, where he was an emerging-
markets equity strategist, said in a phone interview today that
he is “looking at opportunities.”  Sophia Stewart, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, said
developing-nation stocks are now being covered by the global
equity strategy group led by London-based  Robert Buckland .  Dennis was appointed Citigroup’s global emerging-markets
equity strategist in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
