Iluka Resources Ltd. (ILU) , the world’s
largest zircon producer, fell to the lowest in at least three
months in Sydney trading after it said output dropped 49 percent
and production will be further cut this quarter.  The  stock  declined 4.2 percent to A$8.90 at 12:19 p.m.
local time, the lowest since Dec. 27. That compares to the 0.6
percent decline in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  Production of zircon, rutile and synthetic rutile in the
three months ended March 31 dropped to 110,900 metric tons, the
Perth-based company said in a  statement . Iluka, which said in
February it would cut output of the minerals by half, will halt
all synthetic rutile operations this quarter.  Output is “expected to decline further as a result, before
restoration of more usual settings as demand recovers and a draw
down of finished goods inventory occurs,” Iluka said. There’s
evidence of improved zircon demand lead by  China  in markets
other than  Europe  which remains weak, it said.  “Europe continues to be the thorn in Iluka’s side,” said
Evan Lucas, a markets strategist at IG Markets Ltd. in
 Melbourne .  To contact the reporter on this story:
