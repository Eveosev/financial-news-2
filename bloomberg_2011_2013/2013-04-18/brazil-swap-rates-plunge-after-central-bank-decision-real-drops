Brazil ’s swap rates tumbled after
the central bank raised benchmark borrowing costs yesterday less
than some analysts had forecast, spurring speculation that the
cycle of monetary tightening will be limited.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2014 plunged 38
basis points, or 0.38 percentage point, to 7.85 percent at 9:25
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real depreciated 0.6 percent to 2.0119
per  U.S. dollar .  “This is a gradual adjustment of a modest monetary policy
cycle,” Flavio Serrano, a senior economist at Banco Espirito
Santo de Investimento SA in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone
interview. “The chance that they will speed up the pace at the
next meeting is low. The shorter-term rate futures contracts
should fall a lot.”  The bank’s board voted 6 to 2 to increase the target
lending rate by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent from a record
low 7.25 percent.  Policy makers said in their statement that “the high level
of inflation” and “resilience of inflation” required a
response, which was tempered by the central bank’s recognition
that “external uncertainties” also required “that monetary
policy be managed with caution.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
