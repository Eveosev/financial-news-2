Bank Rossii should use monetary and
credit policy to help the economy grow without undermining core
goals of keeping inflation low and the financial system stable,
Elvira Nabiullina, bank’s next chief.  Nabiullina, President  Vladimir Putin ’s economic aide who
was backed by lawmakers this month to become the first woman in
June to head a Group of Eight monetary authority, said the
current growth rate is “below potential.”  “In my view, the central bank should consider trends of
the economic growth. This what any central bank does,”
Nabiullina told reporters late yesterday. “I am opposed to
heating up the economic growth by acceleration of inflation.”  The first change of leadership in more than a decade at the
Russian central bank, which controls the world’s fourth-largest
reserves, comes as the country’s $2 trillion economy is growing
at the weakest pace since a 2009 contraction.  Russia  risks
sliding into a recession without stimulus, according to Economy
Minister Andrei Belousov.  Putin has urged the government to come up with a plan to
revive the flagging economy as he maintains that combating
inflation and boosting wages are top priorities. His medium-term
economic growth target is 5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
