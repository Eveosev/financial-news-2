Raiders stole four rhinoceros
heads, worth an estimated 0.5 million euros ($650,000), from the
National Museum of Ireland.  Four raiders overpowered and tied up a security guard during
the robbery late yesterday, the Dublin-based museum said in a
statement today.  “The stolen rhinoceros heads have a total of eight horns
that have probably been taken to supply the illegal trade in
powdered horn that is used in traditional medicines in the  Far
East ,” the museum said. “Their price is based on weight.”  Thieves have turned to museums in their seach for rhino
horns, as several species of the animal have become close to
extinction, the museum said. The stolen rhino heads were placed
in storage more than a year ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
