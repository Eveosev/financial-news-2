Travis d’Arnaud, the  New York Mets ’
top prospect, broke his left foot last night in a minor league
game.  The 24-year-old d’Arnaud, a catcher for the Mets’ Triple-A
affiliate in  Las Vegas , will fly to New York to be examined at
the Hospital for Special Surgery, the Mets said today in an e-
mailed statement. The release said that the injury is a fracture
of the first metatarsal, the bone behind the big toe.  The Mets acquired d’Arnaud in the offseason as part of a
trade that sent pitcher R.A. Dickey to the  Toronto Blue Jays . He
is rated the team’s top prospect, and sixth-best in baseball, by
 MLB.com .  In 12 games this season, D’Arnaud is hitting .250 with one
home run and eight runs batted in.  -- Editor: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
