Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) , the
embattled maker of robot surgery devices, said first-quarter
profit rose 32 percent on greater use of its da Vinci system.  Net income  was $188.9 million, or $4.56 a share, from
$143.5 million, or $3.50 a share a year earlier, the Sunnyvale,
California-based company said today in a statement. Earnings
topped the $3.98 average of 14 analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue increased 23 percent to $611.4 million.  Intuitive Surgical’s  da Vinci robot system , which costs
about $1.5 million each, is used in 1,371 hospitals and was
involved in more than 300,000 operations last year, the company
has said. The device maker is facing at least a dozen lawsuits,
including one at trial this week in Washington state, alleging
patients were injured by during surgery with the system and
doctors hadn’t been trained properly in how to use the robot.  “Despite a concerted effort by vocal critics of robotic
surgery, support remains strong among patients, surgeons and
hospitals,” Gary Guthart, Intuitive Surgical’s president and
chief executive officer, said in the statement. “Da Vinci
surgery has clinically proven benefits in offering a minimally
invasive option to a broader group of patients than traditional
technologies.”  Intuitive Surgical declined 2.8 percent to $493.37 at the
close in  New York  before the earnings announcement. The
company’s shares have  dropped  16 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
