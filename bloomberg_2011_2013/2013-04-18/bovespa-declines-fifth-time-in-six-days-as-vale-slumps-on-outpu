The Bovespa index fell for the
fifth time in six days as  Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s third-largest
mining company, reported iron-ore production that missed
analysts’ estimates.  Vale contributed the most to the stock gauge’s decline.
Shopping mall service provider  BR Malls Participacoes SA (BRML3)  led
gains by companies that sell in the domestic market after the
central bank raised borrowing costs yesterday less than some
analysts had forecast, fueling bets the cycle of monetary
tightening in Brazil will be limited.  Brazil’s benchmark equity index retreated 0.5 percent to
52,606.15 at 10:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo after earlier rising as
much as 0.7 percent. Vale said in a statement after the market
closed yesterday that first-quarter output declined 3.5 percent
to 67.5 million metric tons, trailing the 68.3 million-ton
average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Lower iron-ore production suggests weak first quarter of
2013 results,” Marcos Assumpcao and Andre Pinheiro, analysts at
the investment bank Itau BBA, wrote in a note to clients dated
yesterday.  The real weakened 0.6 percent to 2.0125 per dollar. The
Bovespa index plunged 2.1 percent yesterday to the lowest level
since July 25 after a drop in commodity prices pushed Brazilian
producers lower and the  International Monetary Fund  cut its
forecast for global growth.  Vale slid 1.5 percent to 30.54 reais. BR Malls jumped 3
percent to 23.64 reais.  Brazil’s central bank raised its benchmark  interest rate 
for the first time since July 2011, seeking to slow inflation
levels jeopardizing an economic recovery. The bank’s board, led
by President Alexandre Tombini, voted 6-to-2 to increase the
Selic rate 0.25 percentage point to 7.50 percent from a record
low, matching the median forecast of 58 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “There was some concern the central bank could be more
aggressive,” Lucas Brendler, who helps manage 5 billion reais
of assets at Geracao Futuro, said by phone from  Porto Alegre ,
Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
