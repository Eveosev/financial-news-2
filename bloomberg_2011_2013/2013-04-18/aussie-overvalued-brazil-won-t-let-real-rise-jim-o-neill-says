Australia’s currency is overvalued
and  Brazil ’s weak economy means it won’t allow the real to
appreciate, according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman
 Jim O’Neill .  “The currency I find the most interesting is the
Australian dollar,” O’Neill, 56, said at a Goldman Sachs
seminar in Tokyo today. “The Australian dollar is significantly
overvalued.”  O’Neill said it is “easy to dislike every major
currency.”  The so-called Aussie strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.0324
today, reversing a drop of 0.3 percent. The currency is
extending its longest stretch above parity with the  U.S. dollar 
since it was freely floated in 1983. In addition to resource
investment, Australia’s dollar has been boosted by foreign
purchases of government debt.  Brazil’s central bank this week raised its benchmark
 interest rate  for the first time since July 2011 in a bid to
tame inflation. Policy makers have swung between selling
currency swaps to prevent the real from falling too quickly and
offering reverse currency swaps to protect exporters by reining
in gains.  O’Neill will step down this year from his current role as
chairman of Goldman Sachs’s asset-management division, which he
has held since 2010, according to a February announcement. He
joined the company in 1995 as a partner, became head of global
economics, commodities and strategy research in 2001 and was
added to the European management committee in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
