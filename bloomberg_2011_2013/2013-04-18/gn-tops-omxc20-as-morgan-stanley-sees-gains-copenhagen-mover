GN Store Nord A/S (GN)  topped gainers in
Copenhagen’s benchmark index after Morgan Stanley said  Denmark ’s
second-largest hearing aid maker will perform better than rivals
William Demant A/S and Sonova Holding AG.  GN, based in Ballerup, Denmark,  gained  1.1 percent to 109
kroner, making it the best performing stock in the OMX
Copenhagen 20 index. Trading volume was 9 percent of the three-
month daily average at 9:52 a.m. local time.  GN unveiled new additions earlier this month to its ReSound
Verso hearing aid series at the  American Academy  of Audiology
annual meeting. The “unique” product will help the device
maker gain market share at the expense of Copenhagen-based
Demant as new tenders are put out, Morgan Stanley analyst
Michael Jungling said in a note today to clients.  “We would classify 2013 as a big tender year,” Jungling
said. “Given the relatively smaller size, GN would see the
biggest potential boost compared to Sonova and William Demant.”  The company’s forecast for sales growth of 4 percent to 6
percent is “ conservative ,” Jungling said. He has an overweight
recommendation on GN and a price target of 115 kroner. Revenue
may increase even more than his estimate of 6.7 percent, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
