The euro zone’s move toward common
bank oversight must be accompanied by a common process for
handling failing banks, European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said today.  “It’s important that both supervision and resolution will
be at the same level, in this case at the euro-zone level,”
Rehn said in a Bloomberg Television interview in  Washington .
“They have to go hand in hand.”  The European Central Bank is set to take on oversight
powers next year over all euro-area banks after the legislation
underpinning the supervisory system was signed off today in
Brussels.  “This agreement on the single banking supervisor is a
major step towards banking union,” Irish Finance Minister
Michael Noonan said in an e-mailed statement. “We need to build
on this momentum to make progress on the next building blocks:
bank resolution and deposit guarantees.”  Ireland holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation EU.  The European Commission remains on track to unveil its
proposal for a single resolution mechanism “before the
summer,” Rehn said. He said further moves toward banking union
are needed to prevent a recurrence of the sovereign debt and
banking crisis that has so far forced five of the euro zone’s 17
nations to seek aid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
