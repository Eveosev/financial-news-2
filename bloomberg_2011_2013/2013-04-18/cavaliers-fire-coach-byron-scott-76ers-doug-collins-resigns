The  Cleveland Cavaliers  fired coach
 Byron Scott  while the  Philadelphia 76ers  announced that  Doug
Collins  resigned, less than 24 hours after both teams played
their final games of the National Basketball Association season.  The  Detroit Pistons  also fired coach Lawrence Frank after
the team finished 29-53, nine games outside of a playoff spot in
the Eastern Conference.  Scott was fired today after three years, general manager
Chris Grant said in a  statement  on the team’s website.  The 52-year-old was 64-166 in Cleveland, finishing fifth in
the five-team Central Division all three seasons. The Cavaliers
were 24-58 this year, losing their final six games of the season
and finishing 25 1/2 games behind the division-leading Indiana
Pacers.  “It is critical for where we are as a team to ensure that
we capitalize on every opportunity for development and success
and we have fallen short of that on the court,” Grant said. “I
believe we needed to make this change in order to get to a
better position to achieve our goals.”  76ers owner Josh Harris today announced Collins’s
resignation, according to the team’s Twitter account. Collins
was 110-120 since taking the job prior to the 2010-11 season,
leading the team the playoffs in 2011 and 2012.  Philadelphia was 34-48 this year, Collins’s worst season in
12 years as an NBA head coach. The 76ers finished fourth in the
 Atlantic Division , 20 games behind the  New York Knicks .  Collins, 61, will remain with the team as a consultant,
according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.  Losing Seasons  Frank, 42, was 54-94 in two seasons with the Pistons. It
was Detroit’s fifth consecutive losing season, and fourth
straight year in which the team failed to make the playoffs.  “We thank Lawrence for his hard work and dedication, but
we feel it is in the best interest of the franchise to make a
change at this time,” Pistons President of Basketball
Operations Joe Dumars said in an e-mailed release.  Frank is the 11th consecutive Pistons coach to last three
or fewer seasons with the team. Yahoo Sports reported yesterday
that Frank told Pistons owner Tom Gores that he should not be
retained next year if the team was unwilling to guarantee the
option in his contract for 2014-15.  -- Editor: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
