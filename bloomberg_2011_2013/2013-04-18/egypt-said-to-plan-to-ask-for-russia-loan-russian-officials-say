Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi
will request a loan at a meeting tomorrow with Russian
counterpart  Vladimir Putin , two Russian officials said, speaking
on condition of anonymity because discussions are confidential.  Russia will consider an aid request from Egypt if it’s made
during the talks between the leaders of the two countries in the
Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin’s spokesman said. “If such a
request is made, we will consider it,”  Dmitry Peskov  told
reporters today.  Egypt will also discuss Russian grain supplies during the
meeting, Peskov said. Mursi’s office didn’t respond to an e-
mailed request for comment.  The  International Monetary Fund  left Cairo April 16 without
signing an agreement for a $4.8 billion loan that Egypt, a
Soviet-era ally of Russia, is seeking from the Washington-based
lender. Egypt’s foreign reserves have plunged more than 60
percent below their December 2010 levels, reaching $13.4 billion
last month, equivalent to less than three months of imports.  Russia lent Cyprus 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in 2011
and agreed this month to restructure the deal after the
Mediterranean island signed a 10 billion-euro bailout package.  To contact the reporters on this story:
