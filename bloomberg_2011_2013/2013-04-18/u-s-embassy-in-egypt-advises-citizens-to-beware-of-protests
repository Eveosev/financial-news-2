The U.S. Embassy in Cairo issued an
advisory warning of planned demonstrations through April 20.  A security  message  directed at U.S. citizens and posted on
the embassy website today said the ruling Muslim Brotherhood and
other Islamist groups have called for a “million man”
demonstration across  Egypt  tomorrow to oppose a court ruling
that called for the release from custody of former President
 Hosni Mubarak .  The security message said the U.S. doesn’t expect the
demonstrations to target the embassy or U.S. interests, while
advising that the possibility of violence “exists should
opposing groups come into contact with one another.  To contact the reporter on this story:
