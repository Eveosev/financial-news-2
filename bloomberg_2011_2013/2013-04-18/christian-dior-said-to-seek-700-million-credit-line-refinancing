Christian Dior  SA, the French
luxury goods maker, is seeking to replace a 535 million-euro
($700 million)  credit line , according to three people with
knowledge of the matter.  The company wants to raise a five-year facility to replace
the loan it  obtained  in 2007, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the deal isnâ€™t public. Dior may increase
the size of the transaction after it received more commitments
than the 500 million euros it first sought, they said.  Hugues Schmitt, a spokesman for Paris-based Christian Dior,
declined to comment on the financing.  BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole SA, Credit Mutuel CIC, ING
Groep NV, Natixis SA and  Societe Generale  are arranging the
debt, said the people. The lenders may sign the final loan
documents this week along with other banks, the people said.  Dior, which owns about 41 percent of  LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , is offering to pay an initial interest margin
of 80 basis points, or 0.8 percentage points, more than the euro
interbank offered rate, the people said. Lenders will also
receive a commitment fee equivalent to 35 percent of the margin
as well as a participation fee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
