West Texas Intermediate crude rose
for a second day to trim its third weekly drop, the longest
losing streak since November. Brent climbed above $100 a barrel.  WTI advanced as much as 1.2 percent in  New York . Prices
increased the most in three weeks yesterday after the 14-day
relative-strength index sank below 30 on April 17, a signal that
the market is oversold, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Futures
may decline next week on signs that economic growth is slowing,
according to a weekly Bloomberg News survey.  “We would expect a rebound,” said Miswin Mahesh, an
analyst at Barclays Plc in  London . “This year we’ll see very
good demand growth,” and the seasonal weakness in demand is
“something that we think is very transient, very temporary,”
he said.  WTI for May delivery increased as much as $1.06 to $88.79 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $88.14 at 1:42 p.m. London time. The contract climbed
1.2 percent to $87.73 yesterday, the biggest gain since March
26. The more actively traded June future was up 39 cents at
$88.39 today. Trading in WTI futures was 11 percent above the
100-day average. Prices are down 3.5 percent this week and are
13 percent lower than a year ago.  Brent for June settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange rose as much as $1.20, or 1.2 percent, to
$100.33 a barrel. The front-month European benchmark grade was
at a premium of $11.49 to WTI futures. The spread was $10.72 on
April 17, the narrowest closing level since Jan. 25, 2012.  Fuel Demand  Brent may fall below $95 a barrel in the “near term” if
the global recovery stalls, and may slide into a range of $90 to
$100 if world economic growth weakens to 3 percent from 4
percent,  Francisco Blanch , the New York-based head of
commodities research at Bank of America, said in an e-mailed
report yesterday. Brent last traded at $95 in June.  Barclays and BNP Paribas SA are among banks that have said
this week oil’s decline is temporary.  WTI rebounded in early March after its relative-strength
index slid below 30, a technical indication that futures have
fallen too quickly and further losses aren’t sustainable.
Today’s reading is about 36.2.  Thirteen of 27 analysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast WTI will fall through April 26. Eight respondents, or
30 percent, predicted an increase. Six said there would be
little change.  The  International Monetary Fund  lowered its global economic
growth forecasts for 2013 on April 16. The projection for the
U.S., the world’s largest oil consumer, was cut to 1.9 percent
from 2 percent.  China , the second-biggest crude user, was
reduced to 8 percent from 8.2 percent.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut
crude shipments this month as economic weakness constrains
demand and refiners finish maintenance, Halifax, England-based
Oil Movements, a tanker tracker, said yesterday in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
