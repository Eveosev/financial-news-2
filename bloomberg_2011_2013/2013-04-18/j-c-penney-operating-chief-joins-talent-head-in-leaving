J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  said two more
executives who were hired by former Chief Executive Officer Ron
Johnson have left the company.  Chief Operating Officer Michael Kramer and Chief Talent
Officer Daniel Walker no longer work at the retailer, Plano,
Texas-based J.C. Penney said yesterday in public filings. The
two worked with Johnson when he ran  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s retail unit and
joined the department-store chain after he became its CEO in
November 2011.  J.C. Penney replaced Johnson as CEO on April 8 with his
predecessor, Myron Ullman, after annual sales slumped 25 percent
to $13 billion, leading to a net loss of $985 million. Ullman
has so far focused on raising cash, including drawing $850
million from the company’s credit revolver and hiring Blackstone
Group LP to help raise at least $1 billion, people familiar with
the situation said last week.  The departures follow those of other executives hired
during Johnson’s reign leaving the company, including Nick
Wooster, senior vice president of design and trends, and Sissie
Twiggs, a vice president of media in digital marketing.  Kramer received a cash payment of $2.1 million upon his
exit, the company said.  J.C. Penney rose 2.6 percent to $15.16 yesterday in New
York. The shares have dropped 23 percent this year, compared
with an 8.1 percent rise for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
