Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. (2330) , the world’s largest contract maker of chips, forecast
record quarterly sales and raised its  spending  plan amid rising
smartphone demand. The stock surged the most since May 2009.  Second-quarter revenue will be NT$154 billion ($5.2
billion) to NT$156 billion, the Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company
said yesterday. That’s at least 9 percent higher than the
NT$141.2 billion average of 21  analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The company’s shares rose 6.6 percent to NT$106.50 at
the close in Taipei, accounting for 44 percent of the  Taiex
Index’s (TWSE)  1.8 percent gain.  TSMC posted first-quarter profit that beat estimates as
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and  HTC Corp. (2498)  join Sony Corp. and  ZTE
Corp. (000063)  in releasing new smartphones, driving orders for mobile
chips. Chairman  Morris Chang , whose company gets $7 for every
smartphone sold worldwide, raised his capital expenditure plan
by as much as 10 percent as TSMC seeks to buy more equipment to
meet demand for newer manufacturing technology.  “The company has already entered a new growth period,”
Chang, 81, who is also Chief Executive Officer, told investors
yesterday. “We attribute our strength to first, mobile-related
applications whose demand remains strong, and TSMC’s strong
position in 28 nanometer technology.”  Revenue from the technology, its most-advanced production
technique, climbed to account for 24 percent of sales during the
first quarter as  clients  such as  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  and  Broadcom
Corp. (BRCM)  contract more orders to the Taiwanese company.  China Demand  One nanometer, equal to one billionth of a meter, measures
the size of connections within a chip. A smaller number implies
more advanced technology, allowing semiconductors to be smaller
and more powerful.  TSMC has climbed 25 percent in the last 12 months, compared
with a 4.3 percent advance for the benchmark Taiex Index. The
stock fell 0.1 percent to close at NT$99.9 yesterday before the
earnings were announced.  Spending this year will be $9.5 billion to $10 billion,
compared to an earlier forecast for $9 billion, as the company
brings forward the ramp up of 20 nanometer technology for which
it already has 20 customers, Chang said.  “The sales outlook is higher than most people expected,”
said Randy Abrams, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG with an
outperform  rating  on the stock. “We can see that  China  and
 emerging markets  are now joining developed markets in spurring
demand for phones and tablets which is driving chip demand.”  First-quarter  net income  rose 18 percent to NT$39.6
billion, TSMC said, beating the NT$37.2 billion average of 20
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Profit and margins
were boosted by a more favorable  exchange rate  in addition to
stronger demand, Chief Financial Officer  Lora Ho  said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
