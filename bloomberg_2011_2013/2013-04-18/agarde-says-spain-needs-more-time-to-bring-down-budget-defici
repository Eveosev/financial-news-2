Christine Lagarde , managing
director of the  International Monetary Fund , said Spain needs
more time to reduce its  budget deficit  as the economy labors
with record unemployment.  Spain “clearly needed to do fiscal consolidation, but we
do not see a need to do upfront, heavy-duty fiscal consolidation
as was initially planned,” Lagarde said at a press conference
in Washington today. The country “needs more time.”  The IMF this week marked down its forecast for the Spanish
economy by 0.1 percentage points, forecasting a 1.6 percent
contraction for this year. Spain last year overshot the deficit
goal imposed by the European Union by more than 50 percent after
recapitalizing its banks and is pushing EU officials to increase
its 4.5 percent target for this year.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said last month he expects to
cut his economic forecast. The government, which has predicted a
0.5 percent contraction in 2013, will publish its medium-term
fiscal projections on April 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
