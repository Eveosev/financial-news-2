Telekom Srbija AD, Serbia’s
national phone company, said its 2012 net income fell by almost
half in a year when assets contracted and long-term liabilities
and spending expanded.  The Belgrade-based company, whose shares aren’t listed on
the Belgrade Stock Exchange, said net income dropped 49.5
percent to 11.25 billion dinars ($131.75 million) from 22.27
billion dinars in 2011. Operating profit rose to 19.77 billion
dinars from 19.57 billion dinars, according to a filing to
Serbia’s Business Registers Agency. Costs rose 3.8 times to
12.46 billion dinars, while assets dropped to 165.3 billion
dinars from 172.9 billion it said.  Telekom Srbija’s base capital increased to 100 billion
dinars from 82.5 billion in the previous year, and total capital
dropped 23.6 percent from 131 billion dinars a year ago.  The company, fully owned by the state and is still the
dominant fixed-line operator, raised 470 million euros from a
19-member bank syndicate in early 2012 to consolidate ownership
and refinance old debts. The government will sell Telekom only
if it gets 2.5 billion euros ($3.26 billion) for the entire
stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
