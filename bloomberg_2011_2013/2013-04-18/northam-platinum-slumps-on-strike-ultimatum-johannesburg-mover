Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM)  fell the most
in almost seven months in Johannesburg trading after giving
striking workers until tomorrow to report for duty or face
potential dismissal.  The  shares  dropped as much as 6.7 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Sept. 21, and traded down 5.8 percent at
32.30 rand as of 4:36 p.m. local time.  Workers at South Africa’s Zondereinde mine face
disciplinary action including possible dismissal if they don’t
return to work by the morning, Memory Johnstone, a spokeswoman
for the Johannesburg-based company, said in an e-mail.  Rock drillers at the mine, located on the western limb of
the platinum-rich Bushveld Complex, walked out on April 2 in a
protest over pay and bonuses. The strike echoes labor action
across South Africa’s platinum industry in 2012, which led to
mine shutdowns and wage increases of as much as 22 percent.  “The whole modus operandi and the way the thing is playing
out is similar to last year,” said Michael Kavanagh, a Cape
Town-based metals and mining analyst at Noah Capital Markets.
“It’s going to be interesting how this one plays out, bearing
in mind upcoming wage discussions.”  Most platinum miners belonging to South Africa’s Chamber of
Mines have wage agreements expiring at the end of June, Elize
Strydom, the chamber’s chief negotiator, said in an e-mail.  Northam has lost 12,500 ounces of platinum group metals and
143 million rand ($15.6 million) during the unauthorized strike,
the company said in a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
