Finance Minister El-Morsi El-Sayed Hegazi said an agreement on a loan with the International
Monetary Fund can be achieved in “a few weeks” and urged the
country’s political parties to unite around an  economic program 
attached to the aid.  “We are promised that this will be in a few weeks,”
Hegazi said in a Bloomberg News interview today in Washington
when asked about the possible loan. “The IMF would like to see
to what extent the political parties and the authorities are
ready to have some prior actions” taken, such as a general
sales tax, he said.  Egypt ’s bid to conclude a $4.8 billion IMF loan agreement
has been prolonged amid political bickering and unrest that made
it harder to implement IMF-backed changes such as tax increases.
The economy is still struggling to recover from the turmoil that
followed the 2011 uprising that ousted President  Hosni Mubarak .  “Egypt needs their political parties to reconcile, to have
consensus and to know that we can’t wait to resolve political
issues,” Hegazi said.  Egypt’s negotiations with the IMF in Cairo ended this week
without a loan agreement, halting a bond rally.  Hegazi also said the IMF wants Egypt to rationalize fuel
subsidies. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde today said
more work needs to be done for a loan and that the fund is
working with Egyptian authorities.  “I very much hope that we can succeed,” she said at a
press conference. “I very much hope that we do, because I think
the country is exposed to vulnerabilities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
