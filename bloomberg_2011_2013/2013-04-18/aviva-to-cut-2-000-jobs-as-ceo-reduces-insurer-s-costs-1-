Aviva Plc (AV/) , the U.K.’s No. 2 insurer
by market value, will eliminate 2,000 jobs as new Chief
Executive Officer Mark Wilson ramps up cost reduction efforts.  The jobs cuts, equivalent to 6 percent of the global
workforce, will stretch over the next six months across the
U.K.,  Europe  and  Asia , London-based Aviva said in an e-mailed
statement today. The firm is also reducing severance pay from
December, when the cuts are planned to be complete.  Wilson, 46, who took over the helm at the beginning of the
year, is selling assets, cutting jobs and rebuilding capital
buffers depleted by the European sovereign debt crisis as he
attempts to reverse the 60 percent share price decline under his
predecessor  Andrew Moss . He scrapped directors’ bonuses for 2012
and froze pay for the firm’s top 400 managers in March after
cutting the  dividend  by 44 percent and posting a full-year loss.  “Once again finance staff are being forced to pay the
price for boardroom failure,” Dominic Hook, a national officer
for trade union Unite, said in an emailed statement. “To cut
redundancy pay so drastically when there is deep uncertainty
over  job security  is a callous and disgraceful act.”  The stock  climbed  0.4 percent to 296.20 pence at 2:02 p.m.
in London trading, valuing the firm at about 8.7 billion pounds.  Cost Cuts  The insurer, which employs 31,200 people worldwide, said it
will pay two weeks pay for every year of service, down from four
weeks currently. This will be capped at 78 weeks, it said.  The cost-cutting plan has already delivered 275 million
pounds ($420 million) of annual savings and the reductions will
contribute toward reaching an annual target of 400 million
pounds, Aviva said.  “I know this is difficult news for our employees but these
changes are essential if we are to remain competitive,” Wilson
said in the statement. “Aviva needs to become a more efficient
and agile organisation to unlock its potential.”  The company posted a 2012 net loss of 3.05 billion pounds,
following a 3.3 billion-pound writedown on the U.S. business it
agreed to sell to  Leon Black ’s  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  in
December. Operating pretax profit dropped 15 percent from a year
earlier to 2.13 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
