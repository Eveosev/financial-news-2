Abengoa SA (ABG) , the largest developer
of solar-thermal power plants, will sell its industrial-waste
business to funds advised by Triton Partners in a deal that
values the unit at 1.075 billion euros ($1.4 billion).  Abengoa, based in Seville, Spain, will receive about 625
million euros after debt adjustments in exchange for Befesa
Medio Ambiente SA, according to a statement today.  Befesa manages industrial-waste plants in Europe, Asia and
 South America . Abengoa said last year it was spending about $120
million on two steel-dust-waste facilities in Turkey.  The sale allows Abengoa, which produces ethanol and has
developed desalination plants from Algeria to India, to “focus
on our core activities and to reduce our net leverage,” Chief
Executive Officer Manuel Sanchez Ortega said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
