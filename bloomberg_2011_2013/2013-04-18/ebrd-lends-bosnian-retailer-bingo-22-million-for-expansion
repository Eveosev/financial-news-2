The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development will lend $17 million euros (22.2
million) to  Bingo DOO , a Bosnian supermarket chain, for
expansion.  The funds will be used to open two supermarkets in the
Bosnian capital Sarajevo and in the second-largest city, Banja
Luka and to set up a cooling storage, the London-based lender
said in an e-mailed statement today.  It’s EBRD’s third loan to the retailer that runs 77 stores
in the Balkan country, after lending 6.5 million euros in 2010
and 5.4 million euros in 2012, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
