Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  said Myles Zyblock, the chief institutional strategist of its investment-
banking unit, left the firm after 10 years of working for the
bank.  He departed in March, said Gillian McArdle, a spokeswoman
for  Canada ’s largest lender by assets. He joined the Toronto-
based bank after four years as head of U.S. portfolio strategy
and sector research at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in  New
York , according to his profile on  LinkedIn Corp. ’s website. He
previously worked as head of global sector strategy for BCA
Research in Montreal. Telephone and e-mail messages left with
Zyblock weren’t returned.  The strategist estimated in January last year that per-
share earnings for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index would reach
$101 for 2012. His projection was within $1 of what companies
reported, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the time,
estimates from the 11 Wall Street strategists ranged from $99 to
$106.  Zyblock predicted returns for the Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite Index would exceed the S&P 500 in 2013 after the
Canadian gauge underperformed earlier in the year, according to
a March 13 report.  When the  Institute for Supply Management ’s  manufacturing
index  indicates expansion, as it has in 2013, commodity prices
have risen 3.5 percent on average since 1974, he said in the
report. That compares with an 0.9 percent advance in all years
for the same period.  ‘Fading Fears’  “Fading fears of a Chinese hard landing and financial
collapse in  Europe  joined with a general upturn in global
leading data remain strategic supports for commodity demand,
prices and hence the TSX,” Zyblock wrote in the research note.  The S&P/TSX has  slumped  5.9 percent since March 13, led by
a 20 percent plunge in raw-materials stocks, after economic
growth in  China  unexpectedly slowed and U.S. data from jobs to
retail sales missed economists’ estimates. The S&P GSCI Index,
which tracks prices for 24 commodities, has fallen 6.4 percent
in the same period.  Zyblock’s most recent estimate for year-end earnings in the
 S&P 500  was $108 a share, compared with the average forecast of
$108.37, according to an April 8 Bloomberg survey of 17
strategists.  To contact the reporters on this story:
