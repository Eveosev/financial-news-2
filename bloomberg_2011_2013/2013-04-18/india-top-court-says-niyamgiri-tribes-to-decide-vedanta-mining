Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , seeking to
mine bauxite in the eastern state of Odisha for a $9 billion
aluminum project, must win the approval of the tribes inhabiting
the Niyamgiri hills,  India ’s top court said.  Tribal right over land is recognized and the local
authority of the tribes must clear the proposal, a three-judge
panel headed by Aftab Alam of the Supreme Court said today in
its ruling. The environment ministry will take a decision on
granting a lease in three months, based on the report of a panel
to be appointed by the Odisha High Court, it said.  Vedanta’s partner Orissa Mining Corp. had challenged the
federal government’s August 2010 decision to deny permission
because it would affect the livelihood of the Niyamgiri hill
tribes. Orissa Mining has a pact with Vedanta, owned by
billionaire Anil Agarwal, for supply of bauxite from these mines.  Unit Vedanta Aluminium Ltd., which operates a 500,000
metric ton smelter in Odisha state, is delaying commissioning a
new 1.25 million ton factory for want of alumina. Its alumina
refinery has been shut since December as local supplies of
bauxite suffered after permits held by miners in the neighboring
states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh expired.  The environment ministry said March 13 the mines don’t need
fresh approvals to renew those licenses, clarifying an earlier
court order and paving the way for supplies to Vedanta to resume.  To contact the reporters on this story:
