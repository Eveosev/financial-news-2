The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
increased, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
115 basis points as of 10:25 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The measure, which has ranged from
102.3 to 127.5 this year, is poised to close at its highest
level since April 8, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index advanced 2 basis points to 94
as of 9:29 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The benchmark is set to pare its decline to 19 basis points so
far this month, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 2 basis points to 114.5 basis
points as of 8:22 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is set to rise for a fifth
consecutive day, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
