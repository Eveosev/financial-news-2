The University of Notre Dame and
 Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC Sports Group renewed their college football
broadcast agreement through the 2025 season, adding 10 more
years to the existing contract.  Financial terms weren’t disclosed in a statement from NBC.  The extension, the first 10-year deal between NBC and Notre
Dame following five consecutive five-year agreements, begins
with the 2016 season.  The new pact includes media rights on all NBC platforms
with a minimum of seven Notre Dame home football games each
year. It also allows for some games, as well as Notre Dame-based
feature programming, to air on NBC Sports Network.  The Fighting Irish finished the 2012 regular season
undefeated at 12-0 to gain their first berth in college
football’s championship game where they were beaten by Alabama
42-14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
