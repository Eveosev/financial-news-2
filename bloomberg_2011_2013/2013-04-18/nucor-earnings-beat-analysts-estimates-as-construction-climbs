Nucor Corp. (NUE) , the biggest U.S.
steelmaker by market value, reported first-quarter earnings that
beat analysts’ estimates after U.S. construction began to
recover.  Net income fell to $84.8 million, or 26 cents a share, from
$145.1 million, or 46 cents, a year earlier, the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
projected profit of 24 cents, the average of 17  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales declined to $4.55 billion from
$5.07 billion a year earlier.  U.S.  construction  spending rose 7 percent in January and
February compared with the first two months of last year,
according to data released April 1 by the U.S. Department of
Commerce. About 42 percent of domestic steel shipments were used
in construction last year, according to the  American Iron and
Steel Institute .  “The construction market has continued to show positive
signs,” Brian Yu, a San Francisco-based analyst at Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., wrote in a research note yesterday.  Nucor bought Skyline Steel LLC from  ArcelorMittal (MT)  in June
to add products used in building foundations, bridges and locks
and dams. Nucor recycles scrap steel in electric furnaces and is
building a plant in Louisiana to process  iron ore  with natural
gas.  Hot-rolled steel coil, a  benchmark  product used in
automobiles and appliances fell 8.8 percent to average $620 a
short ton in the quarter, compared with $680 a year earlier,
according to data from The Steel Index, a trade publication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
