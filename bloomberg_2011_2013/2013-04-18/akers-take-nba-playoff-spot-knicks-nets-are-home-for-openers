The Los Angeles Lakers clinched the
final playoff berth in the National Basketball Association’s
Western Conference when the Utah Jazz lost their regular season-
ending game last night.  The Lakers (45-37) then defeated the visiting Houston
Rockets 99-95 in overtime at the Staples Center to move up to
the seventh seed past the Rockets (45-37). Earlier in the
evening, the host  Memphis  Grizzlies (56-26) won 86-70 against
the Jazz (43-39) at FedExForum in Memphis.  Pau Gasol had 17 points, 20 rebounds and 11 assists for the
Lakers.  The  New York  Knicks topped the Atlanta Hawks 98-92 and the
Brooklyn Nets beat the Detroit Pistons 103-99 on the last night
of the regular season.  At Madison Square Garden, Chris Copeland had 33 points and
James White added 20 for the Knicks, who were playing without
leading scorer Carmelo Anthony. Anthony sat out to rest before
the start of the playoffs this weekend.  Mike Scott led the Hawks with 23 points and 14 rebounds and
John Jenkins had 20 points.  Golden State’s Stephen Curry set a record for 3-pointers in
a season when he hit his 270th in the second quarter of the
Warriors’ 99-88 victory at the Portland Trail Blazers. He
finished the season with 272. The mark of 269 had been set by
Ray Allen in 2005-06.  The Knicks (54-28) host the Boston Celtics (41-40) and the
Nets (49-33) are home against the Chicago Bulls (45-37) in the
first game of their best-of-seven round-one series on April 20.  In other Eastern Conference playoff games, the defending
