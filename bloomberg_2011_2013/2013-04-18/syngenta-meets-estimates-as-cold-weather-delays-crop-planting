Syngenta AG (SYNN)  reported sales that met
estimates, buoyed by Brazilian operations that helped offset
weaker demand for seeds and crop chemicals in parts of  Europe  as
farmers delayed planting because of cold weather.  Syngenta sales rose 6 percent to $4.6 billion, the Swiss
company reported. That met the $4.57 billion average of analyst
estimates in Bloomberg data. Seeds rival  Monsanto Co. (MON)  reported
fiscal second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates
April 3 as sales of its corn seed and Roundup weed killer
climbed.  “Business momentum was sustained in the first quarter of
2013 despite adverse weather in March delaying northern
hemisphere plantings,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Mack
said in a statement.  Mack is betting that a company reorganization along crop
lines will boost sales to $25 billion by 2020 from $14.2 billion
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
