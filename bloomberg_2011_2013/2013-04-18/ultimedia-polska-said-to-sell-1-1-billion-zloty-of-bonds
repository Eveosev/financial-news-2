Multimedia Polska SA, Poland’s
second-biggest cable television operator, seeks to sell 1.1
billion zloty ($348 million) of seven-year secured bonds next
week, according to three people familiar with the plans.  The Warsaw-based company plans to offer the notes at as
much as 300 basis points, or 3 percentage points, over the
Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate to refinance existing debt, said
the people who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public. The company will collect bids in a
book-building process that ends on April 24.  Multimedia, the biggest Polish competitor of Liberty Global
Inc.’s UPC Polska Sp. z o.o., has 757 million zloty of
outstanding unsecured bonds maturing between November 2015 and
June 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The three
notes pay 300 basis points, 350 basis points and 400 basis
points over Wibor. The company’s net debt rose to 1.01 billion
zloty in 2012 from 858.7 million zloty a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
