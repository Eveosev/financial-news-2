The Treasury’s $18 billion auction
of five-year inflation-indexed notes may draw a yield of
negative 1.384 percent, according to the average forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of six of the Federal Reserve’s 21 primary
dealers.  Bids for the Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or
TIPS, which mature in April 2018, are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. The amount is the largest auction of five-year TIPS,
surpassing the $16 billion sold last April.  The previous auction of the securities, a $14 billion sale
on Dec. 20, drew a  record low yield  of negative 1.496 percent.
It was the seventh-straight five-year TIPS offering with a
negative yield.  Holders of TIPS receive an adjustment to the principal
value of their securities equal to the change in the consumer
price index, in addition to a fixed rate of interest that’s
smaller than the interest paid to a holder of conventional debt.
The difference is known as the break-even rate.  The fixed payment on five-year TIPS, known as the  real
yield , was pushed below zero as the rise in the CPI was greater
than the yield on regular five-year U.S. notes, which fell with
other Treasury yields as investors sought the safety of U.S.
government debt.  December’s five-year TIPS sale had a  bid-to-cover  ratio, a
gauge of demand that compares the amount bid with the amount
offered, of 2.7, versus 3.1 at the previous auction in August.
The average at the past 10 sales was 2.8.  Indirect Bidders  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 49 percent of the securities at
December’s auction, the most since October 2006. The average for
the past 10 offerings was 39.2 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 10.7 percent of
the securities at the December sale, compared with the 8.2
percent average at the past 10 auctions.  TIPS maturing in three to five years have lost 0.02 percent
this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes.
TIPS of all maturities gained 7.3 percent in 2012, while the
broader Treasury market rose 2.2 percent, data show.  The U.S. will sell $99 billion in nominal notes next week:
$35 billion in two-year debt on April 23, the same amount of
five-year securities the next day and $29 billion in seven-year
Treasuries on April 25.  Primary dealers trade government securities with the Fed
and are obligated to participate in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
