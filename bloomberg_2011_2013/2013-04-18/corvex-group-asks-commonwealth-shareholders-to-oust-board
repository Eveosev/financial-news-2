Corvex Management LP and Related
Cos., the second-biggest shareholders of  CommonWealth REIT (CWH) , sent
a letter to  investors  lobbying them to remove the board after
the landlord spurned the companies’ buyout offer.  Jim Lozier, a co-founder and former chief executive officer
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Archon Group LP, agreed to be the
real estate investment trust’s interim CEO if the removal effort
succeeds, New York-based Corvex and Related said in the letter.
They are seeking the board changes through a consent
solicitation, a proxy proposal that doesn’t require a
shareholder meeting. CommonWealth’s trustees sent their own
letter to investors in response today, saying the activists
aren’t entitled to seek the consents and urging no action.  Corvex and Related, whose $2.9 billion takeover offer was
rejected by CommonWealth this week, said the REIT’s trustees and
 management  “are solely beholden” to the company’s president,
Adam Portnoy, and his father, Barry Portnoy, a CommonWealth
founder. The Portnoys also own Reit Management & Research LLC,
or RMR, the external management company for Newton,
Massachusetts-based CommonWealth and four other REITs.  “CommonWealth’s real estate assets trade at a substantial
discount to fair value due to a misalignment of incentives
between RMR and shareholders, and what in our view is plain
mismanagement by the Portnoys and the trustees,” according to
the letter, signed by Corvex founder Keith Meister and Related
CEO Jeff Blau. “Given the accelerating pace of CommonWealth’s
value-destroying activities, we are left with no alternative but
to seek to immediately remove this board.”  Offer Rejection  The investors’  $24.50-a-share bid  was conditional and
didn’t include a financing plan, CommonWealth said on April 15.
The REIT, incorporated in Maryland, also said it adopted
provisions of the state’s Unsolicited Takeovers Act, which it
believes means board members “may only be removed ‘for cause,’
and that no such cause exists.”  Corvex and Related hired Deutsche Bank AG as its adviser
and expects to work with the lender on any required financing,
according to today’s letter. Lozier would serve as interim CEO
until a new board is appointed. CBRE Group Inc. has agreed to
provide interim property management and leasing to
CommonWealth’s portfolio, which are currently done by RMR,
Corvex and Related said.  The investors hold 9.2 percent of CommonWealth’s stock,
making them the largest shareholders behind Vanguard Group Inc.,
which owns 9.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bylaw Rules  CommonWealth said today that Corvex and Related’s record
date, which determines who is eligible to vote, isn’t valid
under its bylaws, and no court or arbitration panel has ruled
that the investors are eligible to seek consent.  “Corvex/Related’s attempted consent solicitation is part
of an effort to seize control of your company for their own
benefit or, alternatively, to realize a quick profit by forcing
a sale of CommonWealth before the full benefits of
CommonWealth’s current business plan are realized,” the REIT
said in the letter, released after the close of trading.  The investors are ineligible to try and remove the board
because they haven’t owned at least 3 percent of CommonWealth
shares for three years, the REIT said in a separate statement
earlier today. CommonWealth made that a rule under its bylaws on
March 1, after the clash between the company and the investors
became public.  Arbitration Hearing  The investors sued CommonWealth on Feb. 27 in  Maryland 
state court alleging in part breaches of fiduciary duty,
corporate waste and breach of contract, according to an April 1
regulatory filing by CommonWealth. A hearing in Maryland on
whether the disputes between the investors and CommonWealth
should be sent to arbitration is scheduled for May 3, according
to an April 15 statement from the company.  Rather than pursue a  sale , CommonWealth plans to stick to
its strategy of concentrating on urban office properties,
selling non-core assets and cutting debt, the company said in
its April 15 statement. The REIT owned $7.3 billion of office
and industrial properties as of Dec. 31, with about 54 million
square feet (5 million square meters) located in 31 states,
 Washington , D.C., and  Australia , according to its website.  CommonWealth rose 1.4 percent today to $22.88. It has
gained 44 percent since Feb. 25, the day before Corvex and
Related made their activist efforts public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
