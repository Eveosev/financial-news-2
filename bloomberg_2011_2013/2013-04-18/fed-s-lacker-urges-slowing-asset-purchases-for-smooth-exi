President  Jeffrey Lacker  said he favors slowing bond buying now
to ensure record growth in the central bank’s balance sheet
doesn’t impede the eventual withdrawal of record accommodation.  “I’m in the camp we have to taper and stop right now if it
were up to me,” Lacker said in an interview with CNBC today.  “The deeper we go with asset purchases, the trickier we
are going to make the exit process,” he said. “That to me is
the largest cost.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
