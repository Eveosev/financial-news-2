Steel reinforcement-bar futures
declined to the lowest level in more than four months as slowing
economic growth in  China , the biggest user, led to a slump in
industrial metals.  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped as much as 2.7 percent to 3,598  yuan  ($582) a
metric ton, the lowest level for a most-active futures since Dec.
7, before trading at 3,665 yuan at 10:15 a.m. local time.  Copper in  London  fell below $7,000 for the first time in
almost 18 months as data from Europe to China raised concern
that demand is faltering. China’s first-quarter gross domestic
product growth and fixed-asset investments, as well as March
industrial production trailed economists’ forecasts.  “A bearish view of the global economy is permeating in the
entire commodities market, gripping investor sentiment,” Xia
Caijun, an analyst at GF Futures Co., said by phone from
Guangzhou today.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was little changed at $139.30
a dry ton yesterday, the lowest level in a week, The Steel Index
Ltd. data show. The average  spot price  for rebar was unchanged
at 3,634 yuan yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
