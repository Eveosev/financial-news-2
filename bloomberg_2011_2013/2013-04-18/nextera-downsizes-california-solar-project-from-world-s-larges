NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , the largest
generator of U.S. solar energy, said a project in southern
California that was expected to be the world’s biggest will be
less than half its initially planned size.  NextEra’s Blythe solar farm will be built in four phases
totaling 485 megawatts of capacity, according to amended
planning  documents  posted today on the California Energy
Commission’s website. It was initially proposed as a 1,000-
megawatt project.  NextEra is downsizing the project to streamline the
permitting process and reduce its environmental impact,
according to the filing. The capital cost may be as much as
$1.13 billion.  NextEra received approval June 27 from a  bankruptcy court 
to purchase Blythe from the former developer, the bankrupt Solar
Trust of America LLC.  The project’s first three phases will each have 125
megawatts of capacity and the fourth will have 110 megawatts,
according to the documents. Construction may begin as early as
June 2014 and last four years, NextEra said. The cost wasn’t
disclosed.  NextEra, based in Juno Beach, Florida, hasn’t chosen a
solar panel supplier and is considering equipment from  First
Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
