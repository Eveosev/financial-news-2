The Senate will hold a procedural
vote April 22 on a bill that would let states collect taxes on
out-of-state sellers, including sales over the Internet and
through catalogs, Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said today.  The bill, backed by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and  Amazon.com
Inc. (AMZN) , would let states collect some of the $24 billion in
revenue they lose to untaxed sales made by retailers with no
physical presence in their states. EBay Inc. and anti-tax groups
such as Americans for Tax Reform oppose the measure.  The Senate took a 75-24 non-binding vote in favor of the
proposal on March 22 as part of its debate on the federal
budget.  Reid, a Nevada Democrat, earlier this week began the
process of bypassing the Senate Finance Committee and bringing
the measure directly to the floor. The committeeâ€™s chairman,
Democrat Max Baucus of Montana, represents one of five states
without a  sales tax . He opposes the bill, S. 743.  To contact the reporters on this story:
