Kingfisher Plc (KGF) , Europe’s largest
home-improvement retailer, agreed to pay 75 million euros ($98
million) for  Romania ’s third-largest do-it-yourself chain
Bricostore in a bid to extend its trade business, according to a
person familiar with the transaction.  The price for the 15-store chain, owned by French retail
firm Group Bresson, is worth less than the net asset value of
the business, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the deal is not yet final. That’s mainly due to the 60
percent freehold ownership of the stores. The retailer said
today the deal will be completed in the next two months and is
expected to be earnings “neutral” in the first year.  Kingfisher, which also owns the B&Q and Castorama chains in
 Europe , said it will convert the retailer to its Brico Depot
trade format to take advantage of the “strong DIY culture among
homeowners” and trade professionals. The retailer is looking to
extend its Brico Depot and Screwfix trade formats in new markets
to drive growth after reporting the first annual profit decline
in four years last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
