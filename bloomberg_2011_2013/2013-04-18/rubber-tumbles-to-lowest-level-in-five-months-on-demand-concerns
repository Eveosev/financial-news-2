Rubber slumped for a fifth day to
the lowest price in five months as a selloff in commodities from
crude oil to metals raised concern that global demand is waning.  Rubber for delivery in September lost as much as 3.9
percent to 242.6 yen a kilogram ($2,474 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange, the lowest level for the most-active
contract since Nov. 14. Futures traded at 247.1 yen by 11:34 a.m.  Copper in  London  fell below $7,000 for the first time in
almost 18 months on weak economic data from  Europe  to  China , the
biggest consumer of metals and rubber. West Texas Intermediate
crude fell for a fifth day. The global economy will expand 3.3
percent this year, less than the 3.5 percent forecast in January,
the  International Monetary Fund  said April 16. The IMF cut its
forecast for China’s 2013 growth to 8 percent from 8.2 percent.  “Sentiment is bearish for commodities, weighing on
rubber,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte,
said by phone from  Singapore . Prices are also pressured by the
high levels of rubber stockpiles, he said.  Global inventories are set to climb to 2.17 million tons in
2014, the highest in 13 years, as production exceeds consumption
through next year, London-based industry adviser The Rubber
Economist said last week. Stockpiles at Qingdao, China’s largest
hub for rubber, climbed to a record 366,900 tons by April 15,
according to the Qingdao International Rubber Exchange Market.  Rubber for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell by the daily-price limit. The contract for
September delivery lost as much as 3.4 percent to 18,575  yuan 
($3,005) a ton.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 1.5 percent to 82 baht
($2.84) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand. The price touched 81.75 baht on April 5,
the lowest level since November 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
