Frankfurt  is Germany’s most
competitive city ahead of Munich and Bonn, according to a study
by Berenberg Bank and a German research institute.  Frankfurt, continental Europe’s financial center, won for
the third time in a row because of the strength of its economy,
education, innovation, internationality, accessibility and
demographic trends, Berenberg and the Hamburg Institute of
International Economics, or HWWI, said in a statement today. The
last survey was carried out in 2010.  “Successful cities attract companies and people,” said
Hans-Walter Peters, Berenberg’s chief executive officer. “A
city’s success makes crucial contributions to a nation’s
competitiveness.”  Frankfurt, home to  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and the  European
Central Bank , has one of the wealthiest and most educated
populations in Germany. It has the highest number of foreign
students and about 19 percent of its workers are “highly
qualified,” according to the survey.  Munich was in second place for the third time in a row,
though the gap has narrowed since the last survey.  “Munich particularly improved on its  population growth ,”
Berenberg Bank and the HWWI said. “That means the Bavarian
metropolis has a chance to make the No. 1 spot in the future.”  Berlin, Germany’s capital and its biggest city, rose to
fifth place in the survey from eighth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
