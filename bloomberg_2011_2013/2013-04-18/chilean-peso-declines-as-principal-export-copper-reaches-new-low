Chile’s peso slid for the seventh
time in eight sessions as the price of the country’s main
export, copper, fell to a 17-month low.  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 475.99 per  U.S. dollar  as
of 10:40 a.m. in Santiago, the lowest closing level since Jan.
1. The currency has weakened 1.9 percent since closing at an 18-
month high on April 8.  Copper is Chile’s biggest export and makes up half of all
its sales abroad. The metal has plunged on concern slowing
growth in  China  and the U.S. will curb demand. China, the
biggest buyer of Chilean copper, reported economic expansion
that was less than economists expected in the first three months
of this year as industrial  output growth  slowed.  “The trigger for this sell-off was the bad retail sales
numbers in the U.S. followed by unwelcome economic data from
China over the weekend,” said Cristian Donoso, a trader at
Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “That was
accompanied by a major fall in the price of copper. The
worsening of  Chile ’s terms of trade means a lower flow of
dollars.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
