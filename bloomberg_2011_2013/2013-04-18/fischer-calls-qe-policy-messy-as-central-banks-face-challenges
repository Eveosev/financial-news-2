Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said he’s worried about the use of unconventional
monetary policies around the world, which make measures to slow
capital inflows a necessity in some countries.  “One has the impression from the press that we all love
doing these complicated things and that quantitative easing
fills us with a sense of power,” Fischer said today at a
seminar in Washington.  “Actually, it fills me with a sense of worry. And it’s not
like doing ordinary monetary policy. It’s messy, it’s ugly,
you’re always struggling to come up with something,” he said.
“And if we didn’t have to be in this world we’d feel much
better. But we do have to be in this world, so we’re trying to
deal with it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
