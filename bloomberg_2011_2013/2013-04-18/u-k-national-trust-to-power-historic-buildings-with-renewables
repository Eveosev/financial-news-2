A charity that protects some of
Britain’s historic places including the family home of Winston
Churchill plans to build five clean-energy test plants as it
seeks to get half its energy from renewables by 2020.  The National Trust will spend about 3.5 million pounds
($5.3 million) building projects in the next year including
hydropower and biomass, and if they’re successful it plans to
spend 10 times that amount by 2020, the Swindon, England-based
organization said today in a  statement  on its website. This may
reduce its energy bill by more than 4 million pounds a year.  “Like householders everywhere we are facing rising energy
bills,” Patrick Begg, rural enterprises director, said in the
statement. “We spend more than 6 million pounds each year
heating and powering the places in our care.”  National Trust members can support the program by buying
renewable electricity from Good Energy Ltd. Good Energy will
then pay the trust 40 pounds a year for each new customer that
signs up to its so-called dual-fuel tariff through the National
Trust. If 5 percent of member households sign up it would raise
3.8 million pounds and result in 95,000 homes powered from
renewables.  The Trust’s properties include Chartwell in Kent, the
principal home of the wartime prime minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
