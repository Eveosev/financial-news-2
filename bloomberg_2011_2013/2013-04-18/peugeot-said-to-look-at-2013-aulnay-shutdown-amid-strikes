PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest carmaker, may shut its plant in the Paris suburb
of Aulnay as early as this year because strikes are disrupting
production, according to two people familiar with the matter.  Peugeot is considering closing the factory as soon as
September, according to the people, who asked not to be named
because no decision has been made yet.  The carmaker outlined plans last year to stop manufacturing
at the Aulnay site, which employs about 3,300 full-time workers
and builds the Citroen C3 compact car, at an unspecified point
in 2014 in a reorganization aimed at restoring profit as the
European auto market shrinks. Paris-based Peugeot, which
reported a 576 million-euro ($753 million) operating loss in
2012, has been  selling businesses  and has a two-year plan to
eliminate 11,200 jobs, or 17 percent of its French workforce.  “The intention of Peugeot management is to go on producing
the C3 at Aulnay to satisfy the demand of its customers while
accompanying its workers in their transition to other careers,”
Jean-Baptiste Mounier, a spokesman for Peugeot, said today by
phone, declining to comment further.  Manufacturing at Aulnay has been hampered by a strike by
the CGT labor union since Jan. 16. The plant is now making 40 to
50 vehicles a day, Anne-Laure Descleves, a Peugeot spokeswoman
at the site, said by phone. That’s as little as 16 percent of
the factory’s current daily capacity of 250 cars.  Peugeot’s first-quarter sales in Europe fell 15 percent to
345,258 vehicles, the second worst performance among the
region’s main carmakers, according to industry figures released
yesterday. The European auto market contracted 9.7 percent in
the period, led by a 20 percent sales plunge at  Ford Motor Co. (F)   To contact the reporter on this story:
