France  sold 7.91 billion euros
($10.3 billion) in debt, with the yield on five-year notes
falling to a record low after President Francois Hollande
pledged yesterday to cut government spending.  The treasury sold 3.58 billion euros of 2018 debt at an
average yield of 0.73 percent, compared with the previous record
of 0.76 percent set in November. It also sold 4.33 billion euros
of two-year bonds at a yield of 0.24 percent.  The record-low borrowing cost comes the day after Hollande
promised to slash government spending by 14 billion euros next
year as part of his effort to revive  Europe ’s second-largest
economy before his term in office expires in 2017. The Socialist
president said he won’t allow debt to rise to 100 percent of
gross domestic product and that keeping the deficit in check is
necessary to maintain low borrowing costs.  “Budget seriousness is the condition for credibility,”
Hollande said in a speech in Paris. “The progressive return to
a balanced budget through spending cuts has to be done.”  France’s debt stood at 90.2 percent of GDP at the close of
last year, the national statistics office Insee said last month.  France’s budget deficit will fall to 3.7 percent of gross
domestic product this year and 2.9 percent next year from 4.8
percent last year, the finance ministry said yesterday. Hollande
aims for a deficit of 0.7 percent in 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
