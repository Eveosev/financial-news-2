JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank by assets, raised $1.5 billion in an offering of two-
year fixed- and floating-rate bonds.  The bank’s $1.25 billion of floating-rate securities yield
45 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate and its $250 million of 0.8 percent debt yields 59
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The bonds may be rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service,
according to a person familiar with the transaction, who asked
not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly.  JPMorgan’s $1.65 billion of 3.4 percent notes due June 2015
traded yesterday at 105.7 cents on the dollar to yield 0.77
percent, or 54.2 basis points over Treasuries, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
