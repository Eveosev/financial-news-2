In great splendor, King Edward sent
his 15-year-old daughter, Joan, as bride to the son of King
Alfonso XI of Castile. Four armed ships set off from  England ,
carrying attendants, belongings and bodyguards, but the princess
never made it.  (To listen to the podcast, click here.)  Ignoring warnings about the plague gripping Bordeaux, the
royal party disembarked. Those who contracted the disease
developed blotchy dark buboes on the skin. Soon there was a
hacking cough, vomiting and a horrible stench, followed by
dementia, screaming and death.  Princess Joan succumbed on Sept. 2, 1348. England, which
had remained untouched by the Black Death, was infected by an
arriving ship, and by October the disease was spreading around
the coast.  Between 1348 and 1351 many English villages lost half of
their population and some were wiped out entirely.  I spoke with Dan Jones, author of “The Plantagenets: The
Warrior Kings and Queens Who Made England” on the following
topics:  1. Plantagenet Royals  2. Brutal Profitable Wars  3. Magna Carta  4. Law and Language  5. Shakespeare’s History Plays  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
