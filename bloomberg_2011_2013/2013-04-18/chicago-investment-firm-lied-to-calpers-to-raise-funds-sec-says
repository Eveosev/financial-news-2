An investment adviser will pay more
than $120,000 to resolve U.S. regulatory claims that he lied to
the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and other
clients about the amount of money his firm managed.  Umesh Tandon, 37, falsely told Calpers in May 2008 that his
Chicago-based firm Simran Capital Management LLC met the
retirement fund’s minimum requirement of having at least $200
million of assets under management, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said today in an  administrative order . Simran, who
now lives in  Texas , managed about $80 million at the time.  On more than a dozen occasions from 2008 to 2011, Tandon
and Simran employees falsely inflated the firm’s assets under
management with retirement systems and other prospective
clients, the SEC said.  “Tandon deliberately undermined the Calpers screening
process by grossly misrepresenting his firm’s purported assets
under management,” Merri Jo Gillette, director of the SEC’s
Chicago office, said in a statement. “To make matters worse, he
then used his association with Calpers to lure other public
institutional investors under false pretenses.”  Tandon, who also agreed to be barred from the securities
industry, didn’t admit or deny the allegations in settling the
claims. A phone call to Tandon’s attorney wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
