Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average declining for the fourth time in five
days, as the yen’s gain weighed on exporters and a drop in
commodities led mining and energy shares lower.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker by market
value, slid 2.2 percent.  Inpex Corp. (1662) , Japan’s No. 1 energy
explorer, slid 2.5 percent. Murata Manufacturing Co., a maker of
parts for Apple Inc.’s iPhone, lost 2.9 percent after audio-chip
maker Cirrus Logic Inc. reported an inventory glut that suggests
sales of the smartphone may miss estimates. GS Yuasa Corp., a
supplier of batteries to Boeing Co.’s Dreamliner, jumped 5.5
percent on a report the grounded plane may resume flights.  The Nikkei 225 dropped 1.2 percent to 13,220.07 at the
close in  Tokyo . The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index lost 1.2 percent to
1,122.97. The gauge last week climbed to the highest since
September 2008, surging 11 percent in the six days after the
 Bank of Japan  announced its most aggressive bond-buying plan.  “Japanese stocks have risen on expectations for monetary
easing and that’s over now,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior
strategist at Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.,
which manages about 10.2 trillion yen ($104 billion) in assets.
“No wonder investors want to sell.”  The Topix surged 57 percent from mid-November through
yesterday amid confidence Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and newly
appointed BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda would take steps to
tackle deflation. The gauge traded at 17.1  times average
estimated earnings , compared with 14 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.3 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Topix Forecast  Morgan Stanley says the Topix will fall to 1,020 in the
near term as investors await corporate earnings and progress on
promised economic reforms. It has a year-end estimate for the
Topix of 1,270, compared with the average year-end estimate of
1,160 by analysts surveyed this month by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPX)  were little changed. The gauge
yesterday dropped 1.4 percent amid disappointing results by
companies from Bank of America Corp. to Textron Inc. The  Federal
Reserve  said yesterday in its Beige Book business survey that
the U.S. economic expansion remained “moderate” amid gains in
manufacturing, housing and autos that offset weakness in
defense-related industries in some regions.  Exporters fell as the yen rose against most of its major
counterparts. Toyota dropped 2.2 percent to 5,430 yen.  Fanuc
Corp. (6954) , a maker of factory robots that gets 76 percent of its
revenue outside Japan, declined 2.3 percent to 14,870 yen.
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s biggest trading company, lost 1.9
percent to 1,722 yen.  Energy Shares  Japan’s exports rose 1.1 percent from a year earlier, the
 Finance Ministry  said in Tokyo today. The trade deficit narrowed
to 362.4 billion yen from 777.5 billion yen in February.  Energy and commodity suppliers fell after West Texas
Intermediate crude fell, gold slumped and copper declined. Inpex
dropped 2.5 percent to 477,000 yen, and smaller Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. lost 1.7 percent to 3,680 yen. Mitsubishi
Materials Corp., Japan’s third largest copper producer, fell 2.2
percent to 263 yen.  Apple suppliers fell after U.S.-based Cirrus, a maker of
audio components for the iPhone and iPad reported an inventory
glut. Murata Manufacturing, which makes capacitors for Apple
products, lost 2.9 percent to 7,910 yen in  Osaka . Toshiba Corp.,
a supplier or memory chips, fell 3.7 percent to 540 yen after
closing yesterday at its highest since October 2009.  GS Yuasa  Cirrus will record a net inventory reserve of $23.3 million
for the three months through March, the company said yesterday.
Most of that -- $20.7 million -- is from a high-volume product
from one customer, it said, without naming the client. Apple
accounts for more than 90 percent of Cirrus’s sales, according
to supply chain estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that rose, GS Yuasa soared 5.5 percent to 404
yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported U.S. regulators plan to
lift a ban on Boeing 787 flights as early as this month. The
plane had been grounded because of problems possibly related to
GS Yuasa’s lithium-ion batteries.  ANA Holdings Inc., the first airline to operate the
Dreamliner, hasn’t decided on whether to resume the flights and
is awaiting approval from the U.S. and  Japan , spokesman Ryosei
Nomura said by phone today. ANA added 3.6 percent to 204 yen.  Brokerages posted the second-biggest gain among the Topix’s
33  industries  after data showed foreign investors last week
bought the most Japanese stocks since at least 2001. Overseas
buyers purchased a net 1.57 trillion yen in the shares,
according to the Finance Ministry.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) , Japan’s second largest
brokerage added 2.6 percent to 837 yen. Ichiyoshi Securities Co.
added 7.7 percent to 1,376 yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  gained 0.4
percent to 25.92, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.4
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading
volume on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  was 18 percent above the 30-day
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
