Vale SA (VALE5)  sent one of the largest
iron-ore carriers to a Chinese port in what may be the first
call by one of the ships in the country since 2011 as the mining
company tries to overcome restrictions on the vessels.  The Vale Malaysia, a so-called Valemax vessel able to haul
about 400,000 metric tons of the commodity used to make steel,
entered the Chinese port of Lianyungang on April 16, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The last large ore carrier to
call in  China  was the 388,133-deadweight-ton Berge Everest in
2011, said Krispen Atkinson, maritime business manager at IHS
Fairplay, a Redhill, England-based research company that tracks
ships using signals to satellites and antennae.  Vale, the world’s biggest iron-ore exporter, has been
talking with Chinese businesses and officials about ending
restrictions on Valemaxes in the country’s ports, Jose Carlos Martins, executive director of ferrous minerals and strategy,
said on a December conference call.  A Vale official in  Rio de Janeiro , where the company is
based, declined to comment today. Vale is assembling a Valemax
fleet in an effort to manage the cost of shipping cargoes to
 Asia , its main market, and compete more effectively with BHP
Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group, whose Australian iron-ore
mines are closer to China. Vale plans to have 35 of the ships by
the end of the year, its website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
