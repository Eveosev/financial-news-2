The United Arab Emirates has
arrested seven people accused of being linked to al-Qaeda and
suspected of planning to carry out acts against national
security, the state news agency  WAM  reported.  The “terrorist cell” was planning “acts that compromise
the security of the nation, citizens and residents, and were
recruiting people and promoting for al-Qaeda,” WAM said today,
citing an unidentified official. It said the suspects were Arabs
without being more specific.  The suspects provided logistical support and funds to al-
Qaeda and sought to extend their activities to other countries
in the region, the agency said.  Al-Qaeda has no known affiliations with local Islamist
groups that are politically active in the Persian Gulf region.  It was the second instance of al-Qaeda-related arrests in
less than a year and part of a wider crackdown on suspected
security threats. Since September, U.A.E. officials have
arrested dozens of people accused of collecting sensitive
military information, planning attacks in the Gulf region and
conspiring against the state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
