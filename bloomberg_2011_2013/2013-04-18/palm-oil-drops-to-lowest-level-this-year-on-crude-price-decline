Palm oil  fell to the lowest level
this year as a slide in crude  oil prices  dimmed the demand
prospects for the tropical oil as a feedstock for biofuels.  The contract for July delivery fell as much as 0.4 percent
to 2,265 ringgit ($747) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives and was little changed at 2,276 ringgit at 12:19
p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures have lost 6.9 percent this year
and are headed for a 3.2 percent drop this week.  Brent crude continued to trade below $100 a barrel and West
Texas Intermediate crude traded near the lowest level in four
months as U.S. fuel use declined and production climbed to a
two-decade high. Exports from Malaysia, the second-biggest
producer, fell 4 percent to 648,275 tons in the first 15 days of
April from the same period in March, Intertek said April 15.  “Crude oil’s decline is impacting the  market sentiment  and
a sharp drop in prices will see a stronger impact on bio-diesel
demand,” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a Mumbai-based director
at Commtrendz Risk Management Services Pvt. Ltd. “Poor exports,
resumption of higher production in the coming months and a good
soybean crop are pressuring prices. Demand should be relatively
weak in the coming months.”  Soybean oil  for July delivery slid 0.3 percent to 49.29
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade and soybeans gained
0.3 percent to $13.84 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery lost 0.6 percent to
6,074 yuan ($983) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, while
soybean oil retreated 0.6 percent to 7,598  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
