Brent crude  rose from a nine-month
low and West Texas Intermediate advanced for the second time in
six days, on speculation that losses were exaggerated.  The European benchmark climbed as much as 1.6 percent,
reversing an earlier loss of 1 percent. WTI also added as much
as 1.6 percent. Brent’s 14-day relative strength index was at
28.1, a sign prices may have fallen too far. European shares
rose after the biggest four-day selloff since July as Italian
and Spanish bonds rallied. Brent may slip to a range of $90 to
$100, according to Bank of America Corp.  “We do not believe that the timing is there just yet for
Brent prices to drop sustainably below $100,” said Torbjoern Kjus, a senior oil analyst at DNB ASA in Oslo.  Brent for June settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange increased as much as $1.58 to $99.27 a barrel,
and traded for $98.87 at 12:59 p.m. local time. Brent settled at
$97.69 yesterday, the lowest close since July 2, after dropping
below $100 a barrel this week for the first time in more than
eight months. The volume of all futures traded today was 39
percent higher than the 100-day average.  WTI for May delivery was at $87.87 a barrel, up $1.19, in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after
falling earlier as much as $1.07 to $85.61. It slid 2.3 percent
to $86.68 yesterday, the lowest closing price since Dec. 13. The
volume of all futures traded was 63 percent larger than the 100-
day average.  Brent Premium  The front-month European benchmark grade was at a premium
of $10.74 to WTI for the same month. The spread closed at $10.72
yesterday, the narrowest closing level since Jan. 25, 2012.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  advanced 0.6 percent at 7:20
a.m. in  New York , while Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures
added 0.4 percent.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield dropped seven
basis points to 4.61 percent, and Italy’s fell six basis points
to 4.19 percent.  Brent’s 14-day relative strength index fell to 22
yesterday, its lowest since June 21. A reading of 30 or below
typically indicates that a market has fallen excessively and is
interpreted by traders as an opportunity to buy.  Brent may fall below $95 a barrel in the “near term” if
the global recovery stalls and may slide into a lower trading
range of $90 to $100 if world economic growth weakens to 3
percent from 4 percent,  Francisco Blanch , New York-based head of
commodities research at Bank of America, said in an e-mailed
report.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has no
plans for special talks, two OPEC delegates said, asking not to
be identified because such discussions are private. An official
at OPEC’s Vienna headquarters declined to comment when contacted
by phone today. The group’s next scheduled meeting is on May 31.  Brent may decline as low as $90 if OPEC doesn’t signal its
readiness to defend prices by restraining supply, said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .  “Market sentiment has clearly worsened,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
