Manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region expanded in April at a slower pace than projected as
fewer orders prompted managers cut back on hiring and
inventories.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
 index  fell to 1.3 in April from 2 the prior month. Readings
greater than zero signal expansion in the area covering eastern
 Pennsylvania , southern New Jersey and  Delaware . The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a gain
to 3.  The data follow a report last week showing expansion also
cooled at factories in the  New York  Fed region. This week,
separate data from the Federal Reserve indicated output at
factories is moderating as companies try to limit inventories as
the world’s largest economy slows after gaining speed in the
first quarter.  Estimates of 55 economists in the Bloomberg survey ranged
from minus 5 to 10.  The Philadelphia Fed’s new orders measure fell to minus 1
from 0.5 in March, while shipments climbed to 9.1 from 3.5. The
inventory index dropped to minus 22.2, the weakest since October
2009, from zero.  A measure of employment decreased to minus 6.8 from 2.7.  The measure of prices paid eased to 3.1 in April, the
weakest since July 2009, from 8.5 in March. An index of prices
received decreased to minus 7.5, the lowest since August 2010,
from minus 0.8.  Economists monitor the Fed’s regional surveys for clues
about the Institute for Supply Management national figures on
manufacturing. The next ISM report is due May 1. Manufacturing
makes up about 12 percent of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
