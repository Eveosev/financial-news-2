     April 18 (Bloomberg) -- Philip Morris International Inc.,
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, posted
first-quarter earnings that fell more than analysts  estimated  as
tax increases and economic weakness hurt shipments.  Net income  fell 1.7 percent to $2.13 billion, or $1.28 a
share, from $2.16 billion, or $1.25, a year earlier, the New
York-based maker of Marlboro cigarettes said today in a
statement. Excluding some items, profit was $1.29 a share.
Analysts projected $1.34, the average of 15 estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Louis Camilleri, who is retiring
next month, has introduced new varieties of top-selling Marlboro
to win smokers abroad. Global shipments slid 6.5 percent,
including a 10 percent drop in the economically struggling
European Union and a 43 percent decline in the  Philippines ,
where excise taxes were increased in January.  “Volumes were much weaker than we expected,”  Christopher Growe , an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp. in St. Louis, wrote
today in a note. He recommends buying Philip Morris shares and
had expected shipments to decline 3.5 percent.  Philip Morris lowered its forecast for per-share profit
this year to $5.55 to $5.65 because of unfavorable currency
effects. Analysts estimated $5.72, on average. The currency
effect is about 19 cents a share, an increase from a projection
of 6 cents Feb. 20, the company said.  Philip Morris fell 2.5 percent to $91.69 at the close in
New York. The  shares  have climbed 9.6 percent this year while
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 8.1 percent.  Stronger Dollar  The Dollar Index, a gauge of the greenback against
counterparts at six major U.S. trading partners, has gained 3.6
percent this year. The stronger dollar reduces the value of
sales from abroad when translated back into the U.S. currency.  Philip Morris gets all of its sales outside the U.S. and
last year got about 35 percent of its revenue from the European
Union. The euro has slid 1 percent against the dollar this year.  Revenue rose 2.8 percent to $18.5 billion. Price increases
in markets including Russia, France, Indonesia and  Argentina 
boosted sales $531 million.  Shipments of the top-selling Marlboro brand sank 4.8
percent to 68.7 billion cigarettes. Global volume declined to
204.9 billion.  The shipments decline in the first quarter “was not
unexpected” because Philip Morris had implemented or announced
about 75 percent of the price increases it plans for 2013, Chief
Financial Officer Jacek Olczak told analysts today on a
conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
