Sweden’s winter-wheat harvest was
little changed last year, even with record-high yields, after
rain made reaping impossible in some regions, the government
statistics office reported.  Winter-wheat production was 1.96 million metric tons,
compared with 1.97 million tons in 2011,  Statistics Sweden   said 
on its website today. Yields rose to 6.83 tons a hectare (2.47
acres) from 5.63 tons. The grain was harvested from 286,260
hectares, down from 349,500 hectares.  “Long periods of rain have led to a total lack of
harvesting in significant areas,” Statistics Sweden wrote.
“The areas that were able to be harvested in many cases
produced high yields.”  Spring-wheat production climbed to 357,500 tons last year
from 260,900 tons in 2011, while farmers harvested 1.64 million
tons of spring barley, compared with 1.34 million tons in the
prior period.  The harvest of winter rapeseed advanced to 231,100 tons
from 173,500 tons, while spring planting of the oilseed produced
87,200 tons, up from 74,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
