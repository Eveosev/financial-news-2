Hog futures rose to the highest in
almost two weeks on signs of shrinking U.S. pork supplies and
the outlook for increasing demand. Cattle prices were little
changed.  Hog carcasses averaged 276.5 pounds (125.4 kilograms) in
the  Iowa  and southern Minnesota area in the week ended April 13,
down 0.3 percent from a week earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Consumers tend to boost meat purchases
for outdoor grilling as temperatures rise around this time of
year.  “The weights actually came down, and that’s providing some
support,” Lou Arens, a broker at PCI Advisory Services in
Waucoma, Iowa, said in a telephone interview. “It’s getting
into grilling season, and we need to push these futures a little
bit higher.”  Hog futures for June settlement rose 0.4 percent to 90.675
cents a pound at 10:45 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Earlier, the price reached 91 cents, the highest for a most-
active contract since April 5. Through yesterday, the commodity
climbed 5.4 percent this year.  Cattle futures for June delivery fell less than 0.1 percent
to $1.218 a pound. Earlier, the price reached $1.22225, the
highest since April 9.  “Our demand has been a little bit sluggish,”  Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures Inc. in  Oklahoma
City , said in a telephone interview. “We’ve not done a really
good job of marketing cattle.”  U.S. producers probably sold about 1.801 million fattened
cattle to slaughterhouses last month, down 6.1 percent from
March 2012, according to the average of 13 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. The USDA will release inventory figures
tomorrow in  Washington .  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.1
percent to $1.47375 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
