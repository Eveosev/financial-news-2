India’s bonds advanced, sending the
10-year yield to the lowest since July 2010, on speculation
falling commodity prices will reduce inflation and give the
central bank room to cut  interest rates .  Easing inflation “increases the probability of more
accommodative monetary policy,”  Raghuram Rajan , the top adviser
in the  Finance Ministry , said in an April 16 interview.
Wholesale prices in India, which imports about 80 percent of its
oil needs, rose 5.96 percent in March, the least since November
2009, and below the central bank’s 6.8 percent projection for
the month. The cost of Brent crude dropped 12 percent to $97.63
per barrel this year.  “Monetary easing is definitely on the cards to restart the
growth engine,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader
at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “The steep drop in
prices of oil and gold is a huge positive.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.78 percent as of
10:44 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year note
since July 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  India  is the world’s largest buyer of gold. Prices of the
precious metal fell 0.6 percent to $1,367.76 an ounce today and
are down more than 18 percent this year.  The nation’s gross domestic  product  rose 5 percent in the
fiscal year ended March 31, the weakest pace since 2003, the
statistics agency estimates. The  Reserve Bank  of India will cut
the repurchase  rate  by 25 basis points to 7.25 percent at its
next review on May 3, according to 12 of 13 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. One predicts no change.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 7.25 percent, the lowest level since January 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
