The BP Plc-led Azeri-Chirag-
Guneshli field in Azerbaijan’s section of the Caspian Sea pumped
8 percent less oil in the first quarter, the  Turan  news service
reported, citing a government official it didn’t identify.  The ACG deposit, the country’s largest, delivered 8.1
million metric tons of oil, or an average of 670,000 barrels a
day, compared with 8.8 million tons a year earlier, Turan said.  Output has dropped since 2010 when ACG produced on average
823,100 barrels a day. The ACG partners also include  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and State Oil Co. of
Azerbaijan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
