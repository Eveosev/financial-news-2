Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded from the lowest level in four months on speculation
output will rise to meet federal demand targets.  The spread widened 1.61 cents to 28.71 cents a gallon at
12:15 p.m.  New York  time a day after the Energy Information
Administration said ethanol output fell 2.6 percent to 832,000
barrels a day last week. Production through April 12 averaged
804,000 barrels a day, or 12.3 billion gallons on an annual
basis, 11 percent lower than the 13.8 billion gallons refiners
are required to use this year.  “Obviously it’s gyrating around, but the production trend
is higher,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone
in Des Moines,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for May delivery slipped 0.7 cent to
$2.451 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
gained 12 percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery climbed 0.91 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.7381 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline rebounded from the smallest
differential since Dec. 10. Blackford said the higher value of
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, the certificates
attached to each gallon of biofuel produced that refiners and
the government use to show compliance with the government
program, encourages use.  RINs Values  Corn-ethanol-based RINs were unchanged yesterday at 71
cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which
cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, sank 7
cents to 79 cents.  Production hasn’t rebounded to the levels seen before last
summer’s drought that devastated corn yields and eroded margins
to manufacture the fuel, Blackford said.  Corn for May delivery fell 15.25 cents, or 2.3 percent, to
$6.4525 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was 11
cents a gallon, up from 6 cents yesterday. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Ethanol output will reach 13 billion gallons this year and
14.1 billion next year, the Energy Department’s analytical arm
forecast in its April 9 Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The Agriculture Department, in the April 10 World
Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report. raised its
projection for corn to be used to make the biofuel to 4.55
billion bushels from an earlier estimate of 4.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
