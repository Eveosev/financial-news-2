Greenhill & Co. (GHL) , the New York-based
advisory firm founded by Robert Greenhill, fell the most in 20
months after reporting first-quarter profit that missed
analystsâ€™ estimates.  Greenhill plunged 9.1 percent to $46.43 at 11:13 a.m. in
New York, the most intraday since August 2011. Quarterly profit
slid 16 percent to $13.6 million, or 45 cents a share, from
$16.1 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier, the firm said
yesterday in a statement, missing the 67-cent average estimate
of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Total revenue declined 3.7 percent to $79.6 million from a
year earlier, missing the $98.3 million  average estimate . The
drop was driven by investment losses of $1.86 million, compared
with gains of $9.44 million a year earlier. Revenue from
advising clients rose 11 percent to $81.4 million.  The company set aside $42.2 million, or 53 percent of
revenue, for compensation expense in the first quarter, compared
with $41.2 million, or 50 percent, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
