The yen and dollar weakened as
Spanish borrowing costs declined at a bond auction and German
lawmakers approved the euro area’s bailout of Cyprus, damping
demand for safer currencies.  The yen dropped against most of its 16 major counterparts
as gains in European shares and U.S. stock futures lured
investors to higher-yielding assets. The Australian dollar rose
against all of its 16 most-traded counterparts.  “We’ve seen a tentative recovery in risk sentiment
following another big sell-off this week,”  Joe Manimbo , a
market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of
Western Union Co., said in an interview yesterday in  New York .
“That’s caused investors to grab some of the recently beaten-
down currencies on the cheap. The fundamental backdrop for the
global economy remains relatively positive.”  The yen dropped 0.3 percent to 128.29 per euro at 8:38 a.m.
New York time after appreciating 0.5 percent yesterday. The
dollar declined 0.1 percent to $1.3046 per euro after climbing
to $1.3002 yesterday, the strongest since April 8.  Japan ’s
currency weakened 0.2 percent to 98.32 per dollar.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, fell 0.1 percent to 82.580 after dropping to
81.716 on April 16, the lowest since Feb. 28.  U.S. Data  The euro remained higher versus the greenback after data
showed the number of Americans filing claims for  unemployment
benefits  was little changed last week. Applications for jobless
insurance payments increased by 4,000 to 352,000 in the week
ended April 13, in line with the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  A separate report is forecast to show an  index (SXXP)  of leading
indicators rose at a slower pace in March than the prior month.  The euro gained as  Spain ’s Treasury sold 4.7 billion euros
of bonds due between 2016 and 2023, surpassing its maximum
target of 4.5 billion euros. The 10-year securities were sold at
an average yield of 4.612, down from 4.898 percent at the
previous auction on March 21. The five-year yields declined to
3.257 percent from 3.557 percent.  Germany’s lower house backed the country’s participation in
the 10 billion-euro bailout of Cyprus as Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said refusing aid risked triggering a default
and contagion to other nations.  “Spain went well, and the German vote in favor for Cyprus
was significant,” said  Neil Jones , head of hedge fund sales at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “Risk appetite is slowly
but surely coming back into the market” and pushing the dollar
and yen lower, he said.  Rand, Aussie  South Africa’s rand advanced 0.1 percent to 9.1637 per
dollar and the Aussie dollar gained 0.3 percent to $1.0323.
South Africa’s benchmark interest rate of 5 percent and
Australia’s 3 percent, compares with close to zero in the U.S.
and Japan.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares rose 0.6 percent and
futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
gained 0.3 percent.  The pound fell earlier against the euro after the  Office
for National Statistics  said U.K.  retail sales  including fuel
dropped 0.7 percent from February when they climbed 2.1 percent.  ‘More Stimulus’  “The weak data this week suggests it’s likely the  Bank of
England  will add more stimulus to the economy,” said  John Hardy , head of foreign-exchange strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in
London. “Although a lot of bad news has been priced in, we
think the pound will probably remain under pressure, especially
against the dollar, given its fundamentals.”  Sterling dropped as much as 0.3 percent 85.74 pence per
euro before trading little changed at 85.52 pence. It
depreciated to 86.37 pence yesterday, the weakest level since
March 15. The U.K. currency rose 0.1 percent to $1.5260.  The Aussie is overvalued and Brazil’s weak economy means it
won’t allow its currency to rise, according to Goldman Sachs
Asset Management Chairman  Jim O’Neill .  “The currency I find the most interesting is the
Australian dollar,” O’Neill said at a seminar in  Tokyo . “The
Australian dollar is significantly overvalued.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
