Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the largest
U.S. coal company by sales, jumped the most in six months after
reporting a narrower loss than analysts expected by reducing
costs in its Australia segment as U.S. demand climbs.  Peabody rose 7.6 percent to $20.46 at the close in New
York, the biggest increase since Oct. 22.  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) , the
second-largest coal producer by shipments, jumped 8.4 percent as
investors expected the company to benefit from the same trends
that helped Peabody since both mine coal in  Wyoming ’s Powder
River Basin, said Brandon Blossman, an analyst at Tudor
Pickering Holt & Co. in Houston.  “Anything that feels good for Peabody and feels OK for the
Powder River Basin feels great for Arch,” Blossman said by
phone today. “It’s a big basin and very important for thermal
coal.”  Peabody reported a first-quarter loss that was narrower
than analysts expected as it sees a recovery in U.S. demand for
the fuel to make electricity. The loss was $23.4 million, or 9
cents a share, compared with net income of $172.7 million, or 63
cents, a year earlier, the St. Louis-based company said today in
a statement. Excluding impairment and closing costs, per-share
loss beat the 14-cent average of 24  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales declined 13 percent to $1.75 billion from $2.02
billion a year earlier as the company sold less coal.  Gas Prices  Rising prices for natural gas, a competing fuel at  power
plants , are prompting generators to shift back to using coal.
U.S. consumption of coal for electricity generation will
increase 7.3 percent to 885.2 million short tons in 2013,
according to an April 9  report  from the Energy Department. Coal
companies cut output by 6.9 percent last year, shutting mines
and firing workers, in the face of lower demand.  “U.S. coal fundamentals have improved from a year ago as
colder temperatures and rising natural  gas prices  result in
utilities increasingly returning to coal,” Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Gregory H. Boyce said in a conference call to
discuss results with analysts.  The company forecast its coal sales will rise to 230 to 250
million tons in 2013, from 225.7 million last year. Peabody
expects second-quarter per-share adjusted results to range from
a 25-cent loss to a 1-cent profit. That lags the average
estimate of a 4-cent profit from 24 analysts.  Costs in the company’s Australian segment, which accounted
for 43 percent of the company’s revenue in 2012, fell 9.5
percent to $77.15 a ton. U.S. costs rose 1 percent to $15.96 a
ton.  “There was a big surprise on Australia costs versus what
they were talking about in the fourth quarter,” Blossman said.
In January, Peabody said it expects costs “in the low $80 per
ton range,” in 2013, a forecast it reiterated today.  The company said its cost to produce U.S. coal is expected
to fall as much as 3 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
