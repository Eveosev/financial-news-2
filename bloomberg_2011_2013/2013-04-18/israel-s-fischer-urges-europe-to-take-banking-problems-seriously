Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said Europe remains the weak link in the global economy
and European Union officials need to tackle the continent’s
banking problems.  Europe “is up and down and still the weakest part of the
global economy,” Fischer said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television today. Europe has to ”really take their banking-
sector problems seriously.”  The  International Monetary Fund  trimmed its global growth
forecast this week and urged European policy makers to use
“aggressive” monetary policy as a second year of contraction
leaves the euro area’s recovery lagging behind the rest of the
world.  The global economy will expand 3.3 percent this year, less
than the 3.5 percent forecast in January, after 3.2 percent
growth in 2012, the Washington-based fund said April 16, cutting
its prediction for this year a fourth consecutive time.  The euro area still faces a contraction of credit as banks
fail to translate the  European Central Bank ’s low interest rates
into affordable credit for companies and households. IMF
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said ECB policy is
“spinning its wheels” and called for a recapitalized and
restructuring banking system.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
