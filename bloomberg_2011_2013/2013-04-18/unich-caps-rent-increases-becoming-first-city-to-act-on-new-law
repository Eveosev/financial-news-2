Munich, which has  Germany ’s most
expensive real estate, will no longer allow rents to rise more
than 15 percent in three years, making it the first city to take
advantage of a new federal law.  The Bavarian government yesterday voted to cap rent
increases in the state’s capital, according to a  statement on
its website . The rules takes effect on May 15.  “Housing must be affordable for renters in Bavarian
cities,” said Bavarian Justice Minister Beate Merk. “With
balanced rental regulation, we ensure this happens.”  Rents in German cities such as Munich and Berlin have
soared as home construction has failed to keep pace with an
influx of people. On average, rents in the largest cities rose
15 percent in the past five years, according to data compiled by
online broker ImmobilienScout. In Munich, they gained about 21
percent.  In December, the German parliament passed a law that allows
state governments to cap rent increases in certain areas at 15
percent every three years, compared with 20 percent previously.
The law comes into effect at the beginning of May.  The median rent in Munich is 13.80 euros per square meter
compared with 7.60 euros in Berlin, according to data compiled
by broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
