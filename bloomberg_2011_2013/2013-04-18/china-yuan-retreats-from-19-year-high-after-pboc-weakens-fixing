China’s  yuan  retreated from a 19-
year high after the central bank lowered the daily  reference
rate  by the most since August amid speculation the currency’s
trading band will be expanded.  The yuan dropped the most in two months as the People’s
Bank of China set the  fixing  0.12 percent lower at 6.2416 per
dollar. The band in which the yuan is allowed to fluctuate,
currently 1 percent, will be widened “in the near future,”
Deputy Governor Yi Gang said yesterday at an International
Monetary Fund conference in Washington. The currency has risen
0.8 percent this year, compared with 1 percent for all of 2012.  “They are likely to prevent significant depreciation of
the  renminbi  but also they will lean against the wind of
appreciation,” said Ramin Toloui, global co-head of  emerging
markets  in Singapore at Pacific Investment Management Co.
Widening the trading band would allow China to alter investor
perceptions that the yuan is a one-way bet, he said.  The currency fell 0.15 percent to 6.1813 per dollar in
 Shanghai , the biggest drop since Feb. 18, according to prices
from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It reached 6.1723
yesterday, the strongest level since the government unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Trading Band  The PBOC’s Yi told reporters in Washington yesterday that
current market conditions make it “appropriate” to consider
widening the band. “It’s good for the market,” he said. The
PBOC broadened the range to 1 percent from 0.5 percent in April
2012.  The band will probably be widened this quarter, Credit
Agricole CIB analyst Anthony Lam wrote in a research note today.
Speculation of such a move may be “the force” driving gains in
the yuan this week, he said.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan declined 0.04
percent to 6.1790 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
6.2522, a 1.1 percent discount to the spot rate in Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.49 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
