Latam Airlines Group SA (LFL) ,  Latin
America ’s biggest carrier, rose the most in eight months after
Deutsche Bank AG  recommended  buying the stock and said costs
will decline as the company pares an expansion drive.  Latam, created last year by Lan Airlines’s $3.3 billion
takeover of  Brazil ’s Tam SA, climbed 3.3 percent to 9,950 pesos
at the close in Santiago, the biggest increase since August. It
was the best performer on the  benchmark Ipsa index , which rose
0.8 percent.  Deutsche Bank raised its recommendation from hold and set a
12-month price target of $27 for the company’s  American
depositary receipts , currently at $20.83. Santiago-based Latam
will expand passenger capacity by 2 to 4 percent this year,
compared with a previous growth plan of 4 to 6 percent,
according to a  presentation  posted on its website in March.  “Capacity rationalization will have a positive impact on
returns,” Deutsche Bank analyst  Michael Linenberg  said in an e-
mailed research note to clients.  The stock is down 12 percent this year, the worst
performance among airlines with a market value above $1 billion
after Korean Air Lines Co.’s 30 percent drop. Latam’s  profit 
fell 97 percent last year to $11 million as it integrated Tam’s
operations.  “The stock’s recent underperformance creates an attractive
entry point for investors,” Linenberg wrote.  Latam will probably also benefit from an expected marketing
agreement between Tam and  Fort Worth , Texas-based American
Airlines Inc. and from a retreat in jet fuel prices, according
to Linenberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
