Boeing Co. (BA)  said it will reduce its
engineering workforce by as many as 1,700 positions this year,
adding to cuts of as many as 2,300 machinists, amid a gap in
work on new plane models.  Some of the engineering cuts will be mitigated through
attrition and a reduction in contract labor, Mike Delaney, vice
president of engineering for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said
in an e-mail to managers today. Layoff notices will be sent to
about 100 engineers in the Seattle area tomorrow, and about 700
will lose their jobs in 2013, he wrote.  The cuts are necessary because development is winding down
on programs such as the 747-8 jumbo jet and the 787-9 Dreamliner
while Boeing’s board hasn’t approved work on the 777-X and
787-10, Delaney wrote.  “Completion of non-recurring development work on the
747-8, 787-9 and the KC-46 Tanker will result in lower overall
engineering employment requirements,” he wrote. Starting on the
upgraded 777 and the 787-10 Dreamliner “might have provided
opportunities to avoid these layoffs.”  The engineer pullback builds on a plan announced in March
to dismiss about 800 machinists this year, part of a reduction
of as many as 2,300 of those jobs with fewer post-assembly fixes
needed on the 747-8 and the 787. Those two planes are Chicago-
based Boeing’s newest models.  Defense Cuts  Companywide employment will be unchanged or slightly lower
this year, Doug Alder, a spokesman at Boeing’s commercial
headquarters in  Seattle , reiterated today. Boeing employs about
174,000 people worldwide, including more than 86,000 in the
Seattle area. The company has also been making cuts in its
defense programs amid lower Pentagon spending.  The planemaker still plans to hire in some areas as
completes a four-year effort to boost output more than 60
percent through 2014, with increases still to come on single-
aisle 737 and the 787.  Boeing fell 0.9 percent to $85.90 at 2:46 p.m. in New York,
joining a retreat by major U.S. stock indexes. The shares rose
15 percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
