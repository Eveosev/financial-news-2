RES Americas Inc., a unit of the
U.K.’s Renewable Energy Systems Ltd., started construction on a
250-megawatt wind farm in  Kansas  that’s owned by units of
 General Electric Co. (GE)  and Italian utility  Enel SpA. (ENEL)   The Buffalo Dunes project southwest of Garden City, Kansas,
will use 135 GE wind turbines, Broomfield Colorado-based RES
Americas said today in a statement.  Southern Co. (SO) ’s Alabama Power
utility has agreed to buy “most of the electricity” for 20
years, RES said.  GE unit GE Energy Financial Services acquired a 51 percent
stake in the $370 million project from Enel Green Power North
America for $40 million and is funding construction, Kossara
Marchinkova, an Enel spokeswoman, said in a phone interview.
Enel is investing $180 million and owns the remaining 49
percent, she said.  Buffalo Dunes is expected to be completed by December, GE
said April 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
