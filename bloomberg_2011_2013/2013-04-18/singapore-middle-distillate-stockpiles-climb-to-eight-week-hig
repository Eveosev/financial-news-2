Middle-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, rose
1.4 percent to the highest in eight weeks, according to a unit
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene increased 146,000 barrels to 10.4 million barrels in
the seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore 
said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the highest since
the period ended Feb. 20. Supplies also gained for a fourth
week, the longest stretch since February 2012.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels  including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen dropped 1.46 million
barrels, or 8.1 percent, to 16.5 million, the ministry’s data
showed. Supplies declined for the sixth time in seven weeks.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate advanced 426,000 barrels, or 4.2 percent, to 10.6
million barrels, according to the data. Stockpiles rebounded
from a four-week low.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
