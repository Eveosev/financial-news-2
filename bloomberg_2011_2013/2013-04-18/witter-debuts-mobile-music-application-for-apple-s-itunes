Twitter Inc. (TWTR) , the Web-based social messaging service, unveiled a mobile-music application that will let its users play and share songs from services including  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iTunes.  The app is available for Apple today and will later be added for devices running Google Inc.’s Android software, Twitter said in a  blog post . In addition to iTunes, it will work with streaming music from Rdio Inc. and Spotify Ltd.  Twitter is going beyond 140-character messages as it vies with social-networking rivals to get users to spend more time on its site. The San Francisco-based company released a video app in January. Adding music would give record companies a way to promote new tracks by taking advantage of Twitter’s word-of-mouth network.  Internet users are increasingly relying on social networks to find new music as streaming services such as Spotify and Rdio let subscribers share songs and playlists through  Facebook Inc. (FB)  The dominant social network recently updated its news feed to make it easier to discover music.  Twitter’s service, called #music, will be available starting today in the U.S.,  Canada , the U.K., Ireland,  Australia  and New Zealand. Users can download it from Apple’s  App Store  and from Twitter’s website.
