Cinemark Holdings Inc. (CNK)  won
dismissal of some claims in lawsuits filed on behalf of victims
of the shooting rampage in July at “The Dark Knight Rises”
premiere in Aurora, Colorado, that left 12 people dead.  U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson in Denver today
agreed to dismiss the negligence claims brought in 10 separate
lawsuits against the movie-theater operator. The judge said the
plaintiffs could proceed with their claims under the Colorado
Premises Liability Act and their wrongful death claims.  “It is a close call,” Jackson said in reference to
whether the plaintiffs made a plausible claim, under the
premises liability law, that Cinemark failed to protect movie
goers against a danger the company knew or should have known.
“I agree, of course, that the issues of liability and damages
are for the jury.”  James Meredith, a spokesman for Plano, Texas-based
Cinemark, didn’t immediately return a call after regular
business hours seeking comment on the ruling.  James Holmes faces murder charges for the July 20 attack
and  Colorado  prosecutors have said they intend to seek the death
penalty. A judge has entered a not guilty plea for Holmes.  The consolidated federal cases include Nowlan v. Cinemark
USA Inc., 12-cv-02517, and Traynom v. Cinemark USA, 12-cv-02514,
U.S. District Court, District of Colorado (Denver).  To contact the reporter on this story:
