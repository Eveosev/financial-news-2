New York Yankees shortstop  Derek
Jeter  will be out until after Major League Baseball’s midseason
break for the All-Star Game, the team said on Twitter.  Doctors found a small crack in the bone near the broken
ankle he sustained during last year’s playoffs. He has yet to
play a game this season.  The All-Star Game is July 16 at the New York Mets’ Citi
Field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
