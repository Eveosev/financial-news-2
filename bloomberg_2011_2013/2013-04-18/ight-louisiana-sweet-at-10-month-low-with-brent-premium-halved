Light Louisiana Sweet oil’s premium
to West Texas Intermediate on the  spot market  narrowed to a 10-
month low as Brent’s premium to WTI held near $11.  Brent’s premium over the U.S. benchmark has fallen by more
than half since February as refinery turnarounds and
disappointing economic data out of Europe and  Asia  have
diminished demand. The European benchmark’s premium to WTI was
$11.03 a barrel at 2:33 p.m.  New York  time, increasing for the
first time in four days.  Gulf crudes like LLS compete with foreign oils priced
against Brent for space in  Gulf Coast  refineries.  LLS, the light, sweet benchmark on the Gulf Coast, weakened
by 50 cents to $11.85 a barrel more than WTI in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , at 2 p.m. East Coast time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It’s the smallest premium since June 14.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet weakened by 40 cents to $11.75 a
barrel more than the U.S. benchmark. Mars Blend, a medium-sour
crude in the Gulf, narrowed its premium by 55 cents to $5.95 a
barrel, the lowest since January 2012.  Crude from the Poseidon formation in the Gulf weakened by
85 cents to a premium of $5.55. The premium for crude from the
Southern Green Canyon fell by 60 cents to $4.65 a barrel.
 Thunder Horse  narrowed 85 cents to $8.40 a barrel more than WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
