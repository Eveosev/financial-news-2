Chinese teenager Tianlang Guan will play in next week’s U.S.  PGA Tour  event in  New Orleans  after accepting a sponsor’s invitation, officials said.  Guan, a 14-year-old amateur, became the youngest player to appear in a major golf championship in 148 years at last week’s  Masters Tournament . He was invited to play in the New Orleans event by sponsor Zurich Insurance Group, the PGA Tour said in a statement.  An eighth-grade student, Guan was the only one of six amateurs to make the 36-hole cut and advance to the final two rounds at Augusta National Golf Club. He shot 3-over 75 in the final round to finish 12-over par for the tournament.  Guan qualified for the Masters by winning the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship in November, where he was the youngest player in the field.  In the tournament’s second round, Guan was assessed a one- stroke penalty on the course’s 17th hole for slow play. The penalty left him at 4 over par. He made the cut only When second-round leader Jason Day missed a birdie putt at the 18th hole to remain at 6 under, leaving Guan within 10 shots of the lead.
