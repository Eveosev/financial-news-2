Mexico ’s peso fell as some U.S.
companies missed earnings estimates, dimming the outlook for the
Latin American nation’s biggest export market.  The peso retreated 0.5 percent to 12.2714 per  U.S. dollar 
at 11:31 a.m. in Mexico City, paring its rally in 2013 to 4.8
percent, still the biggest among the 16 major dollar
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  “It’s definitely a healthy profit taking, and it has to do
with earnings,” Eduardo Rodriguez, a currency trader at Casa de
Bolsa Finamex SAB, said in a telephone interview from
Guadalajara, Mexico. “There’s going to be a lot of
correlation” between the peso and U.S. stocks.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.5 percent today,
paring its increase this year to 8.3 percent. The 30-day
correlation  coefficient  between the peso and the  S&P 500 Index (SPX) 
rose today to 0.71, the highest among the greenback’s major
counterparts after Canada’s currency. A reading of 1 would
signal a move in lockstep.  New York-based Morgan Stanley reported the biggest drop in
trading revenue among the largest U.S. banks.  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , the  San
Jose , California-based company that operates the largest
Internet marketplace, reported first-quarter sales that missed
some analysts’ estimates. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its
exports to the U.S.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to a record low 4.69 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.39
centavo to 147.67 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
