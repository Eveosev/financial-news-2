Gasoline futures declined to a
three-month low amid increasing inventories in the U.S. East
Coast. Crack spreads narrowed.  Futures dropped 0.4 percent. The Energy Information
Administration reported yesterday that PADD 1 gasoline supplies
rose 674,000 barrels last week to 60 million, a six-week high.
The May  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate narrowed 15
cents to $27.79 a barrel, and the  premium  over Brent shrank 39
cents to $16.18.  “The market looks to be searching for a floor and the fact
that there is quite a bit of gasoline supplies in  New York 
Harbor is keeping prices weaker,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil
market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a London research
company.  Gasoline for May delivery sank 1.1 cents to $2.718 a gallon
at 10:23 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Trading
volume was 18 percent above the 100-day average for the time of
day.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery advanced 1.26
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.7472 a gallon at 10:23 a.m., after
settling yesterday at the lowest level since July 10. Trading
volume was 26 percent above the 100-day average.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus May WTI widened 71 cents to
$28.88 a barrel. The June  spread  versus Brent rose 25 cents to
$17.20.  Inventories of distillates, including heating oil and
diesel,  increased  2.36 million barrels to 115.2 million.
Analysts in the survey estimated a decline of 350,000 barrels.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.7 cent to
$3.512 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
fallen 27.4 cents from this year’s high of $3.786 on Feb. 26 and
are 38.7 cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
