GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  rose to the
highest price in 11 years after advisers to the U.S.  Food and
Drug Administration  recommended that experimental treatment Breo
Ellipta be approved to treat a lung disorder.  Glaxo rose as much as 4.1 percent to 1,673.5 pence, the
highest intraday price since April 29, 2002. The shares were up
3.1 percent at 1,656 pence at 8:54 a.m. in London, giving the
comp1ny a market value of 81.2 billion pounds ($124 billion).  The positive panel vote may mean a broad label approval for
the drug, which was developed to treat chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, according to Bloomberg Industries analysts.
The FDA is expected to decide whether to approve the treatment,
which the London-based drugmaker licensed from  Theravance Inc. (THRX) ,
by May 12.  “The benign tone of the FDA briefing documents makes us
materially more upbeat over the near-term approval,”  Andrew Baum , an  analyst  at Citigroup, wrote in a note to investors. He
recommends buying the shares.  It’s unlikely the FDA will block final approval despite
side effects,  Tim Anderson , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein,
wrote in a note. He forecasts that sales of Breo Ellipta will
reach 703 million pounds in 2020. Anderson has a “market
perform” rating on the shares.  Glaxo is Theravance’s largest shareholder, with 27 percent
of the South San Francisco, California-based company’s stock,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
