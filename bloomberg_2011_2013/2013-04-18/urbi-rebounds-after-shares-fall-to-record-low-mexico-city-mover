Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB jumped
the most in a month, leading gains among Mexican homebuilders as
record-low prices lure some investors.  Urbi, the nation’s third-biggest homebuilder by revenue,
 jumped  9.3 percent to 2.48 pesos today, the biggest advance
since March 6, as the  Mexico Habita Index (HABITA)  of six companies in
the sector advanced 5.1 percent. Corp. Geo SAB, Mexico’s second-
biggest builder by revenue,  climbed  7.2 percent, while
Desarrolladora Homex SAB, the biggest, advanced 3.3 percent.  Investors with short investment horizons have been buying
shares to take advantage of historically low  valuations , Carlos
Hermosillo, an analyst with Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, said
in a telephone interview from Mexico City. Builders tumbled this
year as changing government subsidy programs forced builders to
spend cash to adapt. The Habita index fell to a record low 0.3
times book value on April 16.  Urbi shares have  fallen  69 percent this year, while Geo and
Homex have retreated 66 percent and 55 percent, respectively.  Mexico ’s benchmark IPC index fell 0.4 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
