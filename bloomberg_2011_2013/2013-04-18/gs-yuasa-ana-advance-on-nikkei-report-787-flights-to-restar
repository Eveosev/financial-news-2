GS Yuasa Corp. (6674)  and ANA Holdings Inc.
rose in  Tokyo  trading after the Nikkei newspaper reported that
U.S. regulators plan to lift a ban on  Boeing Co. (BA)  787 flights as
early as this month.  The Federal Aviation Authority has notified some Japanese
officials of its intentions, the Nikkei reported today without
identifying a source. Japan’s transport ministry is expected to
lift its own ban after the FAA, allowing Japanese carriers to
resume flights in June, it said.  GS Yuasa, the battery maker for the 787, rose the most in
more than three years while ANA jumped the most in more than
five months after the report. The U.S. FAA will decide “very
soon” whether to allow Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner back in the air,
Administrator Michael Huerta said this week. The planes have
been grounded since Jan. 16.  ANA, the first airline to operate the Dreamliner, is
awaiting approvals from the U.S. and  Japan  aviation bureaus,
Ryosei Nomura, a spokesman, said by phone today. The airline
hasn’t decided on resuming flights from June, he said.  GS Yuasa rose as much as 11 percent, the most since June 17,
2009. The stock changed hands at 415 yen, up 8.4 percent, as of
9:54 a.m. in Tokyo. ANA gained as much as 5.1 percent and was up
at 3.6 percent to 204 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
