Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube video-sharing
website for a second time persuaded a judge to throw out a
 Viacom Inc. (VIAB)  lawsuit claiming YouTube violated copyrights by
letting users post clips from shows without authorization.  U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in  Manhattan  yesterday
granted YouTube’s request for a judgment without a trial. He
said YouTube was protected from liability by the safe harbor
provision of the Copyright Act because it removed infringing
videos when notified.  “There is no evidence that YouTube induced its users to
submit infringing videos,” Stanton said in his ruling.  Stanton ruled in 2010 in Google’s favor. In April 2012, the
U.S. Court of Appeals in  New York  overturned that ruling and
sent the case back to the district court. Viacom said in a
statement that it plans to appeal yesterday’s decision.  Viacom argued that YouTube used unauthorized copyrighted
material from shows such as “The Colbert Report” and “ South
Park ” to draw visitors and make the website more attractive to
potential buyers. The site benefited financially from
infringement through  revenue  from advertisements placed next to
the videos, Viacom said.  ‘Overwhelming Evidence’  “This ruling ignores the opinions of the higher courts and
completely disregards the rights of creative artists,” Jeremy Zweig, a Viacom spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “We
continue to believe that a jury should weigh the facts of this
case and the overwhelming evidence that YouTube willfully
infringed on our rights.”  Google, operator of the world’s biggest Internet search
engine,  bought  YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. Google said in
a filing that Viacom had also been interested in buying the
site.  The case is Viacom v. YouTube, 07-2103, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeal
case is Viacom International v. YouTube, 10-03270,  U.S. Court of
Appeals  for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
