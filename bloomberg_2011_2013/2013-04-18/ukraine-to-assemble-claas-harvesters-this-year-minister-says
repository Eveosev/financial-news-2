Claas KGaA,  Europe ’s largest maker
of agricultural machinery, will start assembling harvesters in
Ukraine this year as the country upgrades its farming equipment
to boost crop yields, Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk
said.  Ukraine wants to assemble Tucano-440 harvesters at TOV NVP
Khersonski Mashinobudivni Zavod, the minister said in e-mailed
statement today. A “significant” portion of the harvesters
assembled in Ukraine will be sold locally and leasing terms are
being worked out, he said.  Ukraine, the world’s largest exporter of sunflower oil and
fourth-biggest exporter of corn, seeks to increase its annual
grain harvest to about 80 million metric tons from 46 million
tons in 2012, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said April 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
