The pound stayed lower against the
euro after a report showed U.K. retail sales fell more than
economists forecast in March.  Sterling was 0.2 percent weaker at 85.66 pence per euro at
9:36 a.m. in  London . The U.K. currency was little changed at
$1.5228.  Gilts were little changed with the benchmark 10-year yield
at 1.68 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
