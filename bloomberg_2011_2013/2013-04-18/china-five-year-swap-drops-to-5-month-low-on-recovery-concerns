China’s five-year  interest-rate
swaps  declined to the lowest level since November on speculation
a recovery in the world’s second-biggest economy will stall.  The nation’s  gross domestic product  increased 7.7 percent
in the first quarter from a year earlier, slower than the 7.9
percent growth in the previous three months, the National Bureau
of Statistics said on April 15. The People’s Bank of China sold
43 billion  yuan  ($7 billion) of 28-day repurchase contracts,
which withdraw cash from the financial system, according to a
trader required to bid at the auctions.  “The five-year swap is soft on the back of weak growth,”
said  Frances Cheung , strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong
Kong. “It takes time for market to get used to below 8 percent
growth in China.”  The five-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined three
basis points to 3.50 percent as of 9:47 a.m. in  Shanghai , the
lowest level since Nov. 21, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 10 basis points to 2.90 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
