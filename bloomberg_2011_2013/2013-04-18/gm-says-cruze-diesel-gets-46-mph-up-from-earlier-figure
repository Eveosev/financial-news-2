General Motors Co. (GM)  said the new
Chevrolet Cruze diesel sedan will get an estimated 46 miles (74
kilometers) per gallon in highway driving, 4 miles better than
the company said in February.  The Cruze diesel, which starts at $25,695, including
freight charges, goes on sales in some U.S. cities, including 
Milwaukee and Baltimore, beginning in June followed by a national
introduction in the fourth quarter, Annalisa Bluhm, a Chevrolet
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  The model is one of about 20 new vehicles Detroit-based GM
is bringing out in the U.S. this year as the automaker works to
replace an aging lineup following its 2009 U.S. bankruptcy
reorganization. GM’s U.S. market share dropped to an 88-year-low
in 2012 as  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  rebounded from natural disasters
in  Asia  in 2011. GM, Toyota and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  are vying to be
the world’s best-selling automaker.  VW has seen increasing success from its diesel vehicles in
the U.S. About 20 percent of VW’s 146,478 Jetta sedan deliveries
last year in the U.S. were diesel, according to the company.  Gary Altman, chief engineer for Chevrolet small cars, told
reporters in February that the diesel Cruze was expected to get
42 mpg on the highway.  “We were still testing at the time,” Bluhm said.
“Engineers really went for incremental improvements and got
46.”  GM has said it hasn’t sold a diesel car in the U.S. since
the 1986 Chevrolet Chevette.  To contact the reporter on this story:
