Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
worst performer this year in the KBW Bank Index, reported a
first-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as lending
margins improved.  Net income fell 24 percent to $1.07 billion, or $1.79 a
share, from $1.4 billion, or $2.72, a year earlier, the McLean,
Virginia-based company said yesterday in a statement. Income
from continuing operations, which excludes some items, was $1.92
a share, compared with the $1.62 average  estimate  of 27 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank has spent more
than $28 billion on acquisitions since 2005 to build what’s now
the eighth-largest U.S. lender by assets. The firm said in March
that the  Federal Reserve  didn’t object to its 2013 capital plan,
which included a proposal to boost the quarterly  dividend  to 30
cents a share from 5 cents.  “Each of our businesses delivered solid results in the
quarter and our  balance sheet  is strong,” Fairbank, 62, said in
the statement. “We continue to generate significant capital and
we’re focused on returning capital to our shareholders.”  Capital One climbed 1.3 percent to $53.50 in  extended
trading  in  New York  yesterday. The shares declined 8.9 percent
this year through the close of regular trading, compared with a
5.4 percent gain for the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  Revenue Climbs  Net interest margin, the difference between what banks pay
depositors and what’s earned on loans, widened by 0.51
percentage point to 6.71 percent from the first quarter of 2012,
according to the statement. Net revenue climbed 12 percent to
$5.55 billion from $4.94 billion, matching the average estimate
of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company included $107 million of reserves to cover
repurchases of soured mortgages in discontinued operations,
according to the statement.  Consumer spending  is cooling as the bank struggles to boost
lending. Retail sales in the U.S., where Capital One gets more
than 90 percent of its  revenue , dropped in March by the most in
nine months. The firm’s U.S. card balances fell to $70.4 billion
in March, the third straight monthly decline, regulatory filings
show.  In February, the bank said it would sell about $7 billion
in Best Buy Co.-branded credit-card loans to Citigroup Inc.,
jettisoning more than 20 percent of the loans Capital One had
 purchased  last year from London-based HSBC Holdings Plc. Chief
Financial Officer Gary Perlin said in March the loans didn’t
meet Capital One’s criteria.  American Express Co. (AXP) , the biggest U.S. credit-card issuer
by customer purchases, said April 17 that first-quarter profit
climbed 1.9 percent to $1.28 billion as the New York-based
lender’s more affluent clients increased spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
