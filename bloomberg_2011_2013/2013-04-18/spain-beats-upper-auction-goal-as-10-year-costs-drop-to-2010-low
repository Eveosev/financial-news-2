Spain  beat its maximum target at a
bond auction and 10-year borrowing costs fell to the lowest
since September 2010 even as the government seeks a higher 2013
 budget deficit  limit amid a sixth year of economic slump.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 4.7 billion euros of debt
($6.1 billion), more than its maximum target of 4.5 billion
euros. Its 10-year benchmark 2023 bonds was sold to yield 4.612,
down from 4.898 percent at an auction March 21. Its five-year
benchmark 2018 notes yielded 3.257 percent, down from 3.557
percent on March 21 while the yield on 2016 notes dropped to
2.792 percent from 3.019 percent on April 4.  Spain’s Treasury has covered 39 percent of its  planned  mid-
and long-term gross funding needs for 2013 amid a rally on debt
from so-called periphery countries. The Treasury needs to raise
more cash than last year as the nation’s debt-to-gross domestic
product  ratio  surged to 84.1 percent in 2012 and the government
is struggling to reduce its deficit.  “This is a very strong auction result for Spain,” Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in  London , said in an e-mailed comment. “This
fits in with the overall theme at the moment of a glut of
liquidity and hunt for yield seeing a strong bid for peripheral
debt and a narrowing of euro-zone bond spreads.”  Market Reaction  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  fell six basis
points to 4.62 percent at 11:02 a.m. in  Madrid , leaving the
spread with similar German maturities at 3.39 percentage points.
That compares with a euro-era high of 7.75 percent in July,
before European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to
do whatever it takes to defend the euro.  Demand for the 2016 notes was 2.84 times the amount sold,
up from 1.86 earlier this month, while the bid-to-cover ratio
was 2.52 for the 2018 securities, down from 3.58 on March 21. It
was 2.58 for the 2023 bonds, up from 1.89. The Treasury is due
to return to the market next week to sell three- and nine-month
bills.  International Monetary Fund Chief Economist  Olivier Blanchard  this week said some investors have doubts about the
future profitability of Spanish banks. The IMF cut its growth
outlook for the country to a  contraction  of 1.6 percent from 1.5
percent previously estimated.  The government, which currently predicts the economy will
shrink 0.5 percent, is due to present its own revised forecast
on April 26. It’ll also propose budget-deficit goals higher than
the 4.5 percent of GDP set by the EU for this year and 2.8
percent for 2014 after overspending rose to 10.2 percent of GDP
in 2012.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  hasn’t ruled out seeking
European aid that could trigger ECB purchases of Spanish debt on
secondary markets, the ECB’s so-called OMT program.  To contact the reporters on this story:
