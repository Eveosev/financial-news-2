Intelsat SA (I) , the world’s largest satellite services business, climbed on its first day of trading after raising $347.8 million in a U.S. initial public offering, less than it sought.  The shares rose almost 7 percent to $19.25 at the close in  New York , after reversing earlier losses. Intelsat sold 19.3 million shares for $18 each, equal to about a 19 percent stake. The company had offered 21.7 million shares for at least $21. At the IPO price, Luxembourg-based Intelsat would have a market value of $1.85 billion.  A group of private-equity funds led by BC Partners Ltd. and Silver Lake Management LLC acquired Intelsat in a 2008 buyout that valued the satellite operator’s equity at about $5 billion. That transaction was partly financed with debt, Chief Financial Officer Michael McDonnell said in a phone interview today. Neither firm planned to offer shares in the IPO, filings show. Intelsat will use proceeds from the offering to repay debt.  The fact that Intelsat’s private-equity owners didn’t sell shares in the IPO was “encouraging for incoming investors,” said Giles Thorne, an analyst at Jefferies LLC in  London , in a telephone interview today.  Intelsat was established in 1964 as the first commercial satellite-services provider, according to its  website . Its European competitors include Paris-based  Eutelsat Communications SA (ETL) , London-based  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT) , and SES SA, the world’s largest publicly traded satellite operator, also based in  Luxembourg .  The stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol I. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. led the offering. The company, led by Chief Executive Officer David McGlade, filed to raise $1.75 billion last May, then reduced that amount in March.  Intelsat generated $2.61 billion in revenue in 2012, a less than 1 percent gain from the year-earlier period. Intelsat’s communications network includes more than 50 satellites that cover more than 99 percent of the world’s populated areas, the filings show.
