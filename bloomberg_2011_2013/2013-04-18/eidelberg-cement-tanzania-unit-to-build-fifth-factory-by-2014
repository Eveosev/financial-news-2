HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) ’s Tanzanian
unit will invest 50 billion shillings ($31 million) to build a
fifth plant there by 2014, boosting capacity to 2 million metric
tons a year, Managing Director Pascal Lesoinne said.  Tanzania Portland Cement Co. has hired Tianjin Cement
Industry Design & Research Institute Co. to construct a factory
with the ability to produce 700,000 tons a year in the
commercial capital of  Dar es Salaam , he said.  “We have seen a tremendous growth of our sales in Tanzania
and we need to keep up with the demand in the future,” Lesoinne
said on April 16 in an e-mailed response to questions. “The
market in Tanzania will continue to grow but the competition
will intensify with the cement production units already under
construction and those in the offing.”  Cement demand grew about 10 percent last year to 2.7
million tons in Tanzania, where construction is booming,
according to the company’s annual report. Growth in the building
industry  accelerated  6.5 percent in the third quarter of 2012,
from a contraction of 5.4 percent a year earlier, according to
the country’s National Bureau of Statistics.  An upgrade of a clinker line at  Tanzania  Portland’s Wazo
Hill plant has ended the company’s reliance on expensive
imports, he said. The company, which is also known as Twiga
Cement, will begin to produce aggregates including gravel and
sand this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
