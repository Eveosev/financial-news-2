RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest
utility, reduced its target for clean-energy capacity by 1
gigawatt, equivalent to about one nuclear reactor.  RWE now plans to have 3.5 gigawatts of renewable capacity
by the end of 2014, Chief Executive Officer Peter Terium told
the company’s annual general meeting today in Essen, Germany.  The company said last month it would cut renewable-energy
investment by half from next year as it seeks to reduce debt and
counter falling earnings. It said in March it wouldn’t meet the
4.5 gigawatt target by 2014, without giving a new number. RWE,
building a 1-billion euro ($1.3 billion) wind farm in the North
Sea, will spend about 500 million euros on its Innogy renewables
unit in both 2014 and 2015, after 1 billion euros this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
