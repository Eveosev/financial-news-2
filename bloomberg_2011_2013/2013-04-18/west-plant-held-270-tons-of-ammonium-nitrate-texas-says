The West, Texas, fertilizer plant
that exploded yesterday killing as many as 15 people held 270
tons of ammonium nitrate as of Dec. 31, according to a report
from the Texas State Department of Health Services.  The Adair Grain Inc. plant also held 110,000 pounds of
anhydrous ammonia, according to the e-mailed Emergency and
