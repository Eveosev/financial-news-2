Visteon Corp. (VC)  Chief Executive
Officer Tim Leuliette ruled out selling control of the company’s
climate-control business that South Korea’s  Mando Corp. (060980)  has been
seeking to buy.  “First of all, the business isn’t for sale,” Leuliette
said in reference to  Halla Visteon Climate Control Corp. (018880) , which
is 70 percent owned by Visteon, in an interview today at a forum
in Shanghai. “Secondly, I haven’t heard from any of them and I
have been in this seat now nine months.”  Mando, South Korea’s third-largest maker of auto parts,
said in August it may offer to buy the 70 percent stake in
former affiliate Halla Climate. Mando Chairman Chung Mong Won
has been seeking to rebuild the Halla Group, which went bankrupt
in 1997 after years of overexpansion saddled the conglomerate
with at least 6.5 trillion won in debt.  Visteon is exploring other options, including one involving
the Van Buren Township, Michigan-based company reducing its
stake to of “something less than 70 and more than 51,”
Leuliette said, without elaborating.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
