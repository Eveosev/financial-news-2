 Mark Carney ’s commitment to transform the central bank and base
decisions on consensus will be a “highly significant
development,” U.K. lawmakers said.  “If these commitments result in meaningful change to the
current hierarchical decision-making processes and culture of
the bank, this will be a highly significant development,”
Parliament’s Treasury Committee, which scrutinizes the BOE, said
in a report in London today.  Carney, the current chief of the  Bank of Canada , will
succeed  Mervyn King  at the U.K. central bank on July 1, taking
over an institution endowed with new responsibilities for
financial regulation as well as monetary policy. King has been
criticized for wielding too much power at the bank and promoting
“group think.” Carney testified at the committee in February,
after which they formally approved his appointment.  The committee also said it would prefer if the BOE’s new
unit, the Prudential Regulation Authority, had a secondary
objective to promote competition in banking. It raised the
concern that prudential requirements could act as a barrier to
market entry and said it didn’t agree with Carney that the
current balance in legislation was adequate.  There is a risk the PRA “may merely pay lip service to
competition considerations,” the panel said. “This would be of
great concern, given the potential for prudential requirements
to act as a barrier to entry and to distort competition between
large incumbent firms and new entrants.”  -- Editors: Fergal O’Brien, Eddie Buckle  To contact the reporter on this story:
