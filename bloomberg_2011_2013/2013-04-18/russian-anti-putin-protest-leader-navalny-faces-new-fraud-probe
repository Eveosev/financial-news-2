Russia opened a fourth criminal
case against Alexey Navalny, an anti-corruption blogger who
helped lead the biggest protests of President  Vladimir Putin ’s
13-year rule.  Navalny and his brother are suspected of organizing a 3.8
million-ruble ($120,000) fraud involving mail deliveries in
2008, according to a  statement  posted today on the Investigative
Committee’s website.  “These allegations are absurd,” Anna Veduta, Navalny’s
spokeswoman, said by phone. “This is their reaction to the
massive public support that we’re receiving.”  Navalny, 36, already faces as much as 10 years in prison
over charges that he defrauded a state timber company in the
Kirov region. Navalny denies any wrongdoing, calling the trial
payback for arranging a series of anti-government demonstrations
that began after parliamentary elections in December 2011.  A court in Kirov, 900 kilometers (560 miles) northeast of
Moscow, postponed a hearing yesterday until April 24 to give the
defendants time to study the case.  The latest investigation has been combined with an existing
probe into a 55 million-ruble fraud, according to today’s
statement. Another case against Navalny concerns the
embezzlement of 100 million rubles from the Union of Right
Forces, a pro-business political party that was led by Nikita Belykh, who’s now governor of the Kirov region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
