Spot gasoline in the  Gulf Coast 
weakened against futures for the first time in six days after
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  said a Beaumont refinery fire was in a unit
that was shut for maintenance and didn’t affect production.  The blaze yesterday injured 12 contract employees, seven of
whom remained in a hospital in Galveston, Texas, today, Rachael
Moore, a Fairfax, Virginia-based spokeswoman for the company,
said in an e-mail.  The discount for  conventional , 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
in the Gulf widened 1 cent to 13 cents a gallon versus futures
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 1:51 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Reformulated gasoline shrank 3 cents to a premium of 3.5
cents a gallon, while conventional,  87-octane gasoline  weakened
3.25 cents to a discount of 9.75 cents a gallon.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  fuel on the Gulf remained unchanged
at 1.5 cents a gallon below Nymex futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West  Texas  Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , slipped $1.27 to fall to $24.72 a barrel. The same
spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil fell 77 cents to $12.87 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
