U.K. government bonds fell, with
10-year yields rising from the lowest level in a week, as a
successful Spanish debt sale and a rally in European stocks
reduced demand for safer assets.  Gilts trimmed this month’s gains as German lawmakers
approved a rescue for Cyprus, fueling speculation the euro-area
debt crisis is being contained. The pound strengthened against
the dollar after falling earlier when a report showed U.K.
retail sales declined in March. The U.K. Debt Management Office
sold 2.25 billion pounds ($3.43 billion) of 30-year bonds.  “Gilts pulled back a bit as they seem to be driven more by
other markets than local data,” said Robin Marshall, a director
of fixed income at Smith & Williamson Investment Management in
 London . “Stocks are doing well today and headlines out of the
euro zone are positive. That probably reduces demand for assets
like gilts or German bunds.”  The 10-year gilt yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.70 percent at 2:12 p.m. in London after
falling to 1.68 percent, the lowest level since April 8. The
1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 dropped 0.115, or 1.15
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 100.465. The yield has
still declined seven basis points this month.  Spain’s Treasury sold 4.71 billion euros ($6.16 billion) of
debt due between 2016 and 2023 today, beating its target of 4.5
billion euros. The 10-year bonds were sold at an average yield
of 4.612 percent, the lowest since September 2010. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index of shares gained 0.3 percent.  German Support  Germany ’s lower house backed the country’s participation in
the 10 billion-euro bailout of Cyprus as Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said refusing aid risked triggering a default
and contagion to other nations.  The pound appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.5287 after falling
to $1.5217 yesterday, the weakest since April 5. Sterling rose
0.1 percent to 85.42 pence per euro.  The U.K. currency weakened earlier after the Office for
National Statistics said retail sales including fuel fell 0.7
percent last month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had
forecast a decline of 0.6 percent.  The Debt Management Office auctioned the 3.25 percent gilts
due in January 2044 at an average yield of 3.121 percent,
compared with 3.42 percent when the government sold the
securities through banks on Jan. 29. The yield on the securities
gained one basis point from yesterday to 3.12 percent.  `Low Levels'  Gilts are likely to be supported as economic data adds to
evidence the U.K. economy is deteriorating, Smith & Williamson’s
Marshall said.  “There’s a case for the Bank of England to further loosen
monetary policy given the weakness of the economy, and that
should continue to keep gilt yields at low levels,” he said.  Gilts returned 1.6 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Treasuries and
German bonds both gained 0.8 percent.  The pound has weakened 4 percent this year, the worst
performer after the yen among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
rose 2.8 percent and the euro climbed 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
