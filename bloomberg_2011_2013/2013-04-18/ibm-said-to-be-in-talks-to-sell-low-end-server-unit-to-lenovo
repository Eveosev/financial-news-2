Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , the Chinese personal-computer maker, is the most likely bidder for parts of  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  (IBM)’s server division, a person familiar with the matter said.  The business, which sells servers running x86 processors, may fetch $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion depending on what assets and liabilities are included, said the person, who asked to not be named because the talks are private. An agreement may still be several weeks away, the person said. Lenovo shares surged 9.5 percent on the news.  Lenovo used the 2005 purchase of IBM’s PC unit as a steppingstone to become the world’s second-largest producer. Now it’s diversifying into other products, such as tablets and smartphones, and allied itself with  EMC Corp (EMC) . last year to boost sales of storage equipment and servers that run corporate networks. Buying IBM’s business would further bolster its capabilities, said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in  Hong Kong .  “Low-cost servers are the fastest-growing, most attractive area of the server business right now, so this would make sense,” Moel said. “This is consistent with Lenovo’s strategy of moving into things that are growing and going new places.”  Lenovo  rose  to HK$7.06 in Hong Kong trading, the largest gain since Sept. 27, 2011. The  shares  are up less than 1 percent this year, compared with the 2.8 percent decline in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index . IBM, meanwhile, dropped 8.3 percent to $190 at the close in New York.  ‘Good Fit’  Cloud computing -- which lets customers access software online, rather than storing it locally -- is increasingly popular. That’s spurring demand for low-cost, energy-efficient servers among companies with large data centers, including  Amazon.com (AMZN)  Inc., Google Inc. and  Facebook Inc. (FB) , Moel said.  IBM’s low-end server business could be a “good fit” at Lenovo, said Laurence Balter, an analyst at Oracle Investment Research in Fox Island,  Washington . The machines, which store corporate data and run computing functions, rely on x86 chips -- similar to the processors used in PCs.  “It’s underperforming because of the cost of doing business on IBM’s side,” he said. “Lenovo probably did the calculations and said, ‘Well, we can make more because IBM’s cost of doing business is so much higher.’”  Lenovo is now the second-biggest PC maker behind  Hewlett- Packard Co (HPQ) . It was the only top-five manufacturer not to see a drop in shipments last quarter, according to research firm IDC.  Shares Gain  The talks were  previously reported  in CRN, a publication aimed at technology integrators. In response to the story, Lenovo said it was in “preliminary” discussions about a potential acquisition with a third party, which it didn’t name.  “No material terms concerning the potential acquisition have been agreed and the company has not entered into any definitive agreement,” Lenovo said in the statement.  Jeffrey Shafer, a Lenovo spokesman, said in an e-mail he had no additional comment beyond that statement.  IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on his company’s earnings call that he wouldn’t comment on rumors.  Ed Barbini , a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM, also declined to comment on the Lenovo talks.  Profit at IBM’s low-end service business has been “underperforming” compared with other parts of its hardware unit, the company said in a  presentation  to investors in February. Revenue for the System X business, which sells x86 servers, declined 9 percent in the first quarter, IBM said. Even so, the company’s total hardware revenue fell more sharply, dropping 17 percent to $3.1 billion.  The company said it would take “substantial actions” to improve the business. A combination of divestitures, job cuts and acquisitions will result in charges in the second quarter and gains in the second half, Loughridge said.  “The low-end server division was a drag, subtracting economic value from Big Blue,” Balter said. “It is a painful but smart move in the long run.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Jeffrey McCracken in  New York  at  jmccracken3@bloomberg.net ; Sarah Frier in New York at  sfrier1@bloomberg.net ; Edmond Lococo in Beijing at  elococo@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at  nturner7@bloomberg.net ; Jeffrey McCracken at  jmccracken3@bloomberg.net
