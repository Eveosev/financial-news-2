Enlighted Inc., a closely held
provider of lighting control systems for buildings, received $20
million from venture capital investors led by RockPort Capital
Partners LLC.  Existing backers Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Draper
Fisher Jurvetson and Intel Capital Corp. also participated in
the companyâ€™s Series C financing round, Enlighted said in an e-
mailed statement.  Lighting consumes about 19 percent of global electricity,
and demand for lighting is expected to increase by 80 percent by
2030, Enlighted Chief Executive Officer Tushar Dave said in the
statement. The company, based in Sunnyvale,  California , provides
sensors and software that can reduce lighting energy costs in
buildings by as much as 75 percent.  Its systems are used in about 10 million square feet of
commercial real estate, about double the amount five months ago,
and customers include  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  and
 LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
