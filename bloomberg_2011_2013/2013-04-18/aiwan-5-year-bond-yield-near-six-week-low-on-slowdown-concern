The yield on  Taiwan ’s five-year
bonds fell to a six-week low as investors sought the safety of
sovereign debt amid concern regional economic weakness will hurt
the island’s exports. The local currency was steady.  Global funds sold $288 million of local stocks in the last
three days, taking net sales in April to $445 million, exchange
data show. Gross domestic product growth in  China , Taiwan’s
biggest overseas market, slowed in the first quarter as factory
output weakened, a sign the nation’s recovery from the slowest
expansion in 13 years has lost momentum.  South Korea ’s finance
ministry lowered its 2013 GDP forecast last month.  “Neighbors including South Korea and China appear to be in
some trouble,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Taiwan yields will probably trade
at this relatively low level in the near term.”  The yield on the 0.875 percent bonds due January 2018 fell
one basis point to 0.923 percent in Taipei, according to Gretai
Securities Market. It touched 0.918 percent earlier, the lowest
level since March 8.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  closed 5.5 percent lower yesterday and traded
below $400 for the first time since December 2011 after its
audio-chip supplier predicted that sales would miss estimates
because of unsold inventory. Taiwan’s biggest technology
companies, including Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., are
suppliers of Apple.  Taiwan’s exports rose 3.3 percent in March from a year
earlier, following a 15.8 percent slump the previous month,
official data showed on April 8.  Taiwan Dollar  The  Taiwan dollar  was little changed at NT$29.91, Taipei
Forex Inc. prices show. The central bank has sold the Taiwan
dollar in the run-up to the close on most days in the past year,
according to traders who asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.44 percent. The  overnight
