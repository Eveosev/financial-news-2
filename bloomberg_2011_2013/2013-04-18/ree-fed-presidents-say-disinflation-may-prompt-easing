Three regional Federal Reserve bank
presidents said a further decline in U.S. inflation below the
Fed’s 2 percent goal may signal a need for more accommodation.  “If inflation looked like it was going to sag further on a
persistent basis, I would certainly consider stimulus for the
purpose of bringing inflation up to target,” Richmond Fed
President  Jeffrey Lacker  said today, adding he doesn’t see an
imminent disinflation risk. Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota today called for guarding the inflation target
“from below,” while  James Bullard  of  St. Louis  said yesterday,
“we should defend the inflation target from the low side.”  Policy makers are expressing concern over disinflation even
as some officials, including Lacker, advocate  curtailing easing 
by slowing the Fed’s $85 billion monthly pace of bond buying.
Consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in February from a year
earlier, matching the lowest level since October 2009, according
to the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation.  “The Fed is missing its dual mandate on both sides --
unemployment is too high, and inflation is too low,” said Josh Feinman, the New York-based global chief economist for DB
Advisors, the Deutsche Bank AG asset manager.  “This simply makes it more likely the Fed will stick with
the program for a while, and talk of scaling back sales this
summer is diminishing, partly because of the inflation data,”
said Feinman, a former Fed senior economist in  Washington .  First Time  Inflation expectations over the next  five  years, as
measured by the spread between Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities and nominal bonds, fell below 2 percent today for the
first time since November. Over the next 10 years, investors
expect 2.3 percent annual inflation, down from 2.6 percent in
March.  The slump in  gold prices  may also signal that investors are
folding long-held bets that monetary stimulus will ultimately
unleash inflation. The spot price of gold fell to a closing
price of $1,347.95 an ounce on April 15 and was at $1,392.68 at
1:33 p.m. in  New York . That leaves the price of the metal 27
percent below its 2011 peak.  “The risks are weighted to the downside rather than
upside” for inflation, said  Ward McCarthy , chief financial
economist at Jefferies & Co. in New York and a former Richmond
Fed economist. “If concern about deflation increases, it is
possible they could start to increase asset purchases.”  ‘Mostly Subdued’  The Fed said yesterday in its Beige Book economic survey
that price increases in the U.S. were “mostly subdued” outside
of residential construction, with most of the central bank’s 12
districts showing “minimal” price pressures. Last month, the
 Federal Open Market Committee  said inflation was “somewhat
below” its goal.  The central bank started a second round of asset purchases,
or quantitative easing, in 2010 amid concern about deflation
risk. Bullard, warning of a Japan-style fall in prices, called
on the Fed to buy Treasury notes in a paper entitled “Seven
Faces of the Peril.”  The Fed may need to step up stimulus to avert continued
disinflation, Bullard said yesterday to reporters after a speech
in New York.  “If it doesn’t start to turn around here soon, I think
we’ll have to rethink where we are in our policy,” he said.  Buy Bonds  The FOMC in March reaffirmed plans to buy bonds at the
current pace until the labor market outlook improves
“substantially.” It also pledged to keep  interest rates  near
zero as long as unemployment is above 6.5 percent and inflation
doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent. Unemployment in March was 7.6
percent.  It’s “very important to protect the target” for inflation
when prices rise or fall too much, Kocherlakota said to
reporters today in New York. A further drop in inflation would
make him “even more” supportive of additional accommodation to
spur growth, he said.  Kocherlakota has called on the Fed to increase stimulus by
pledging not to consider raising the benchmark interest rate
from zero until unemployment declines to 5.5 percent.  In an April 16 speech, Kocherlakota predicted inflation
pressures will “remain subdued” while advocating “a more
accommodative monetary policy that puts more upward pressure on
prices.”  Lacker said today the threat from disinflation is limited.  “With the state of the economy and price and wage trends
what they are, I don’t see a material risk now of the rate of
inflation falling substantially further,” Lacker said to
reporters at a conference in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina .  “I’d of course be giving serious thought to providing
 monetary stimulus ” should disinflation continue, Lacker said,
while reiterating his view that the Fed should slow or end its
bond buying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
