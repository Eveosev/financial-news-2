German solar and wind generators
with a record 36 gigawatts of combined capacity produced power
today, at times exceeding fossil-fired plants, the Muenster-
based IWR renewable energy institute said.  Of the 70 gigawatts of peak power capacity needed at mid-
day, more than half were wind and solar units, the IWR said
today in an e-mailed statement, citing data from power exchange
EEX. At times, the clean-energy generators fed more electricity
into the German grid than their fossil-fired counterparts, the
IWR said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
