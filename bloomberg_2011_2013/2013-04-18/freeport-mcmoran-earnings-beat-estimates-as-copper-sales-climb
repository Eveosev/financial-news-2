Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) , the metals producer that in December agreed to buy two
energy companies, reported first-quarter profit that exceeded
analysts’ estimates after copper sales and costs were better
than expected.  Net income fell to $648 million, or 68 cents a share, from
$764 million, or 80 cents, a year earlier, the Phoenix-based
company said today in a statement. Profit excluding charges to
extinguish debt early and other one-time items was 73 cents a
share, topping the 71-cent average of 17  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales declined 0.5 percent to $4.58 billion from a
year earlier.  Freeport agreed to buy  Plains Exploration & Production Co. (PXP) 
and  McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR)  in a $9 billion cash and stock deal.
Freeport said at the time it couldn’t find a suitable copper
acquisition and wanted to diversify its production portfolio.
The deals are expected to close in the second quarter, Freeport
said today.  The company’s  shares  fell 27 percent from the day before
the transactions were announced through yesterday. Freeport  rose 
0.6 percent to $28.17 today at 11:21 a.m. in  New York .  First-quarter copper sales rose 15 percent to 954 million
pounds, higher than forecast, because of increased output and
sales from the company’s Tenke Fungurume mine in the  Democratic
Republic  of Congo, Freeport said.  Beating Forecast  Freeport’s Jan. 22 forecast was for 940 million pounds,
while the average of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg was
for 943.5 million. Gold sales were 214,000 ounces, compared with
288,000 ounces in the first quarter of 2012.  First-quarter net cash costs to produce a pound of copper
rose to $1.57, compared with $1.26 a year earlier and less than
the $1.60 average of four estimates. Freeport’s forecast in
January was for $1.67.  Earnings beat estimates mostly because of lower-than-
expected costs, Fraser Phillips, a Toronto-based analyst at  RBC
Capital Markets , said in a note today.  It appears the company has cash costs “under control,”
Laurence Balter, chief market strategist at Oracle Investment
Research in Fox Island,  Washington , said in an e-mail.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange averaged $7,958 a metric ton in the quarter, 4.4
percent less than a year earlier. The metal, used in wires and
pipes, declined 4.9 percent in the quarter on concern that
slowing global economic growth would erode demand.  Freeport, which also operates in the Americas, said it
still expects 2013 copper sales of 4.3 billion pounds. The
company increased its forecast for net cash costs this year to
$1.45 a pound of copper, from $1.35 forecast on Jan. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
