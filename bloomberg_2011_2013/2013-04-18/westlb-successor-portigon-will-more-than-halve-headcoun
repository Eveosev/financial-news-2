Portigon AG, the German financial
services adviser that emerged from the failure of WestLB AG,
will cut headcount by more than 1,400 before the end of the year
as it complies with a European Union order to shrink.  The company informed employees on April 16 that it will
reduce staff to 1,130 by the end of December from 2,600 a year
earlier, Eberhard Roll, a spokesman for Dusseldorf-based
Portigon, said today by telephone.  Portigon will move 500 employees to a service unit that
will begin operations July 1, outsource 360 jobs in information
technology and plans to offer severance packages to 600 members
of staff, he said.  The European Commission ordered WestLB to cease operations
last June as a condition tied to the 17 billion euros ($22.2
billion) in aid the state-owned bank received from taxpayers
following the 2007 U.S. housing market meltdown. Portigon, which
advises investors on managing portfolios of loans and other
assets, is helping a state-owned entity sell WestLBâ€™s holdings.  Portigon plans to reduce staff to 150 at the end of 2016,
Roll said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
