Australian stock futures fell and
Japanese futures were little changed, with benchmark gauges in
both countries heading for weekly declines, after an index of
leading U.S. economic indicators unexpectedly dropped.  American Depositary Receipts  of Nissan Motor Co. retreated
0.5 percent from the close of trading in Tokyo. ADRs of  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s second-largest lender by market
value, slid 0.6 percent. ADRs of BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
biggest mining company, advanced 1.4 percent as metals prices
rebounded.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June traded at 13,280 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 13,270
at the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
13,290 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
 S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  retreated 0.2 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index fell 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2 percent this
week though yesterday and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 1.8
percent.  “An incremental U.S. soft patch is inevitable,” said
 Michael Kurtz , Hong Kong-based head of global equity strategy at
Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest brokerage. “Risks to both
the U.S. consumer outlook and to the China outlook are quite
real.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, this week pared five months of gains amid
concern economic growth in the U.S. and China may slow. The
gauge advanced 5 percent this year through yesterday, led by
Japanese shares, amid optimism the Bank of Japan will step up
efforts to stimulate the economy.  Relative Value  That left the gauge yesterday trading at 13.7 times average
estimated earnings compared with 13.9 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.3 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.3
percent. The gauge yesterday fell 0.7 percent as earnings from
UnitedHealth Group Inc. to EBay Inc. disappointed investors, a
measure of manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded at
a slower pace and the Conference Board’s index of U.S. leading
economic indicators unexpectedly declined for the first time in
seven months.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. climbed 0.2 percent in New York
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
