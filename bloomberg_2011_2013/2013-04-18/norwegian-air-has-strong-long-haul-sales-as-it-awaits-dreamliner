Norwegian Air Shuttle AS (NAS)  said
demand for tickets aboard flights connecting  Scandinavia  with
Asia have exceeded expectations as the company prepares to
inaugurate its new long-haul network next month.  The airline will begin flying from Oslo to  New York  City’s
 John F. Kennedy  on May 30 using a Airbus SAS A340 as a
substitute for the  Boeing Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliner originally planned
for the route, the company said in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer Bjoern Kjos said last month that
he’s looking to buy more 787s to add long-haul routes even as
the company’s first Dreamliners remain on hold after the model
was grounded globally. Norwegian Air is among airlines affected
by the idling of the entire Dreamliner fleet on Jan. 16 in the
wake of incidents with lithium-ion batteries. The airline is
scheduled to introduce three 787s this year, four next and the
eighth in 2015, with five leased and three bought outright.  “The establishment of the long-haul operation is
developing in accordance with plan,” the Fornebu, Norway-based
company said in the statement. Norwegian Air’s longer-term aim
for the 787 is to focus on destinations in  Asia  as it seeks to
tap demand for affordable log-haul flights among the emerging
middle class, Kjos said in March.  Norwegian Air rose as much as 7.9 percent to 237.5 kroner
and traded at 236.9 kroner at 10:34 a.m. in Oslo. The company’s
stock has risen 65 percent this year, valuing the airline at
8.33 billion kroner ($1.4 billion).  The airline reported a 117.2 million kroner loss in the
first quarter, down from a 285.5 million kroner loss a year
earlier. Sales gained 23 percent to 2.9 billion kroner, while
the number of passengers jumped 8 percent to 3.93 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
