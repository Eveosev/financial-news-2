A weaker krone would help push up
inflation and cool pressure on  Norway  to cut interest rates,
central bank Governor Oeystein Olsen signaled.  “A weaker krone pulls price growth up, and if we’re only
looking at inflation, that will, in isolation, pull in the
direction of a higher interest rate,” he said in an interview
in Oslo. “But we’re not only concerned with inflation at any
given time.”  Olsen held the bank’s benchmark rate at 1.5 percent last
month and signaled he is ready to cut rates further to stem an
appreciation in the krone. The currency has since dipped 2
percent against the euro, today touching the lowest since June.  Policy makers have kept rates near a record low for 12
months after cutting them twice in 2011 and 2012 to cool the
krone after the currency emerged as a haven from  Europe ’s debt
crisis. Low rates have spurred record debt growth and caused
property prices to surge, raising concern about a potential
property bubble.  The krone rose to a record on a trade-weighted basis in
February, keeping inflation below the central bank’s 2.5 percent
target since 2009 and hurting exporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
