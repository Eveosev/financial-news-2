Spain ’s bonds rose after the nation
sold 10-year debt at the lowest yield since September 2010 as
borrowing costs for governments across  Europe  declined on bets
 interest rates  will stay lower for longer.  Spanish 10-year securities gained for a second day as the
nation auctioned 4.71 billion euros ($6.16 billion) of debt due
between 2016 and 2023, beating its target of 4.5 billion euros.
 France  sold five-year notes at a record-low rate, while Slovenia
hired banks to organize meetings with investors a day after
scooping up twice its target in a domestic offering. Italian
bonds erased gains as lawmakers failed to elect a successor to
President Giorgio Napolitano in the first round of voting.  “It’s fairly clear that interest rates are going to be low
for a very long time and yields are reacting,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at Investec Bank Plc in  London .
“Spain sold debt at the lowest rate for a few years so it is
all good on the government-bond side.”  Spain’s  10-year yield  fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 4.66 percent at 4:51 p.m. London time after
declining to 4.61 percent, the lowest since November 2010. The
5.4 percent bond maturing in January 2023 rose 0.12, or 1.20
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 105.64.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold additional benchmark 10-year
bonds at an average yield of 4.612 percent, compared with 4.898
percent at a previous auction of the securities on March 21. The
nation also sold debt due in July 2016 and January 2018.  Falling Costs  Borrowing costs across Europe have declined since the  Bank
of Japan (8301)  announced a 7.5 trillion yen ($76.4 billion) monthly
asset-purchase plan on April 4, adding to global central bank
stimulus efforts.  Germany  sold 10-year bonds at a record-low
yield yesterday, while  Italy ’s costs fell as it sold 7.2 billion
euros of debt on April 11.  Slovenia’s bonds surged yesterday after the sale of 18-
month bills and German two-year yields fell below zero after
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann was reported by Dow Jones as
saying the  European Central Bank  may lower interest rates if
data warrants.  French bonds were little changed after today’s auction of
7.91 billion euros of notes maturing in 2015 and 2018. The five-
year securities were sold at an average yield of 0.73 percent,
down from 0.89 percent on March 21. France’s 10-year yield was
at 1.79 percent.  Slovenia Syndication  Slovenia hired banks to organize a series of fixed-income
investor meetings across a number of international financial
centers from April 22, said a person who asked not to be
identified because the information hasn’t been published.  Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek’s new government is seeking
to convince markets Slovenia won’t follow five other euro
members in seeking international assistance.  “What happened was a sharp turnaround in sentiment after
the very successful T-bill auction which surprised the market,”
said  Michael Leister , an interest-rate strategist at Commerzbank
AG in London. “The picture has improved very much. The fear of
an imminent bailout has receded.”  The yield on Slovenia’s 4.625 percent bond due in September
2024 dropped five basis points to 6.33 percent after tumbling 60
basis points in the previous two days.  Presidential Vote  Italy’s bonds erased gains after the first round of voting
by the 1,007 presidential electors ended in failure today, with
ex-Senate Speaker Franco Marini unable to gain the necessary
two-thirds majority. A second vote started at 3:30 p.m. in  Rome .  The  10-year yield  was little changed at 4.26 percent after
falling as much as seven basis points.  German bunds erased an earlier decline as a U.S. report
showed manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded in
April at a slower pace than analysts forecast, reviving demand
for the safest securities.  Germany’s 10-year bund yield was at 1.23 percent after
climbing as much as three basis points.  German bonds returned 0.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities gained 5.3 percent and French debt rose 1.1 percent.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Ireland and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
