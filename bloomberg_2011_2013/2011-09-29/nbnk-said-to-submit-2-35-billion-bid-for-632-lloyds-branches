NBNK Investments Plc (NBNK) , run by Peter Levene, submitted a 1.5 billion-pound ($2.35 billion) bid for
the 632 branches being sold by  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , a
person with knowledge of the matter said.  NBNK is the first suitor to submit a formal bid, while Co-
Operative Bank Plc and  Hugh Osmond , the British entrepreneur who
founded U.K. restaurant chain Pizza Express, have also made
indicative offers for the branches, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the discussions are private.
NBNK won’t gain privileged access to financial information about
the branches as a result of its offer, the person said.  Lloyds, 41 percent taxpayer-owned after its bailout, is
seeking 2.5 billion pounds for the assets, which it’s being
forced to sell to comply with  European Union  state-aid rules.  Spokesmen for Lloyds and Co-Operative Bank declined to
comment and an official for Osmond’s Sun Capital Partners wasn’t
immediately available. London-based NBNK said in a statement
today it had submitted a bid for the Lloyds’s assets. A
spokesman declined to comment on the size of the offer.  NBNK’s bid was reported yesterday by  Sky News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
