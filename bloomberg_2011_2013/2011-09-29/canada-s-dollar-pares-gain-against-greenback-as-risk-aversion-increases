Canada ’s dollar pared gains against
its U.S. counterpart as investors remain averse to adding
riskier assets.  The Canadian currency was little changed at C$1.0333 per
U.S. dollar at 12:22 p.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0335
yesterday. Earlier it touched C$1.0257. One Canadian dollar buys
96.78 U.S. cents.  “For the moment,  risk aversion  rules,” said  John Curran ,
senior vice president at the online foreign exchange dealer
CanadianForex Ltd. “We strengthened a little bit off the U.S.
numbers that were better than expected, but that was short-lived
because the greater concern is what’s going on in Europe, and
that’s going to weigh on the Canadian dollar.”  A report showed the American economy grew faster than
earlier estimated and jobless claims declined. The  U.S. economy 
expanded at a 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter, and
applications for jobless benefits dropped by 37,000 in the week
ended Sept. 24 to 391,000, the fewest since April, according to
government data. The U.S. is Canada’s largest trading partner.  Yields on benchmark 10-year debt rose four basis points to
2.23 percent as the price of the 3.25 percent securities fell 33
cents to C$108.79. Yields touched record lows of 1.994 percent
on Sept. 23.  To contact the reporter for this story:
