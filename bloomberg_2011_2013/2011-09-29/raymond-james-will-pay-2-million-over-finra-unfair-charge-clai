Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF)  will
pay more than $2 million to resolve Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority claims that more than 15,500 brokerage
clients were charged excessive commissions on securities trades.  Two units of  St. Petersburg , Florida-based Raymond James
used automated commission schedules from 2006 to 2010 that led
to investors being overcharged by $1.69 million for trades of
mostly low-priced securities, Finra said today in a statement.
The firm didn’t properly weigh security type and transaction
size in evaluating whether charges were appropriate, Finra said.  “Broker dealers must ensure that their automated systems
set commission charges that are fair to investors,” Finra
enforcement chief Brad Bennett said in a statement.  Raymond James, which agreed to resolve the claims without
admitting or denying wrongdoing, will return the $1.69 million
in overcharges and pay $425,000 in fines, Finra said.  “We are pleased to have resolved this matter with Finra,”
Steve Hollister, a spokesman for  Raymond James , said in an e-
mailed statement. The company revised the automated commission
schedule on July 1 of this year after being notified of Finra’s
findings, he said.  The affected trades represent less than 0.1 percent of
total equity trades executed by Raymond James during that time,
and the average impact per affected account was about $110,
Hollister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
