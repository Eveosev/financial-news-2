FIH Erhvervsbank A/S, a Danish
bank, plans to stop lending to a number of real estate
companies, potentially triggering bankruptcies by the businesses
and other creditors, Jyllands-Posten reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Bjarne Graven Larsen.  FIH, which needs to generate cash to refinance 46 billion
kroner ($8.4 billion) in state-guaranteed bonds through 2013, is
asking companies to pay back loans as they come due, the Viby,
Denmark-based newspaper quoted the executive as saying. A credit
crunch may make it difficult for the businesses to find
alternative funding, probably making bankruptcies unavoidable,
Jyllands-Posten said, citing Larsen.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
