Germany  is aware of its
responsibility to fight the debt crisis, Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said.  The current market turmoil with a “huge” contagion risk

on German radio today. That justifies the need to enhance the
powers of the European rescue fund. The fund will be used “as
efficiently as possible,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
