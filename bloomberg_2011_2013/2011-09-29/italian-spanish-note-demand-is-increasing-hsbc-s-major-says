Demand for short-maturity Italian
and Spanish debt is rising as investor’s risk aversion wanes,
according to  Steven Major , global head of fixed-income research
at HSBC Holdings Plc.  “Investors are now looking at putting risk on rather than
taking it off, because they realize that there’s hardly any
value in crowding into Treasuries and German bunds that yield
nothing,” London-based Major said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with  Francine Lacqua .
“There are now signs that people want to buy short-dated Italy
and Spain. You can see some recovery there.”  Italian two-year note yields rose three basis points to
4.40 percent at 10:41 a.m. in London, having climbed from 3.09
percent at the start of the third-quarter. The yield on similar
maturity Spanish debt was little changed at 3.41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
