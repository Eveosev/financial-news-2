The pending sales index
of previously owned homes in the U.S. fell in August,
according to the National Association of Realtors.  The pending sales index fell 1.2 percent from
the previous month. The data is based upon information
from houses under contract as reported by over 100 Multiple
Listing Services and 60 large real estate brokers. A sale is
listed as pending when a seller accepts a sales contract on
a property.  NOTE: About 80 percent of pending home sales will become
existing home sales transactions within two months. The U.S
Commerce department calculates new homes sales based upon signed
contracts. Base value 2001 = 100.  SOURCE: National Association of Realtors    http://www.nar.realtor.com   To contact the reporter on this story:
