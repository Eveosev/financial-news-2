The following table shows a brief history 
of annual inflation and gross domestic product estimates from Brazil
central bankâ€™s quarterly report. Inflation estimates are calculated using
a reference scenario and a market scenario.  NOTES: Reference scenario holds constant the current Selic rate for 
calculations. Market scenario uses market expectations of future 
interest and foreign exchange rates. Inflation estimates are for 
the IPCA index.  SOURCE: Banco Central do Brasil  To contact the reporter on this story:
