Deutsche Post AG (DPW) , the world’s
biggest carrier of air and sea freight by volume, said it’s
facing questions from a regulator after competitors alleged the
company wrongfully charges some clients too little.  “We don’t see this as a formal investigation,” said Dirk Klasen, a spokesman for Bonn, Germany-based Deutsche Post.  The Federal Network Agency is responding to complaints from
unnamed competitors about the pricing policy of Deutsche Post’s
Infopost service, which lets companies send letters to multiple
recipients at a reduced price as long as the contents are
identical, according to a preview of a story being published
today by news magazine  WirtschaftsWoche .  “The Federal Network Agency received a complaint from
competitors, and asked for our standpoint,” Klasen said. “We
offered it, and the agency then usually relays it to the
competitors. It may be that this explanation didn’t satisfy the
competitors, and that’s why they went to WirtschaftsWoche.”  Standard letters usually cost 0.55 euros (75 cents), while
those sent via Infobrief cost 0.35 euros. Competitors alleged
that bills for automobile-breakdown service ADAC, health-
insurance cards from Techniker-Krankenkasse and debit cards from
Deutsche Postbank AG have been charged at the reduced delivery
rate, and were wrongfully classified as advertising.  “If we receive a complaint we look into the matter,”
Rainer Warnecke, a Federal Network Agency spokesman, said by
telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
