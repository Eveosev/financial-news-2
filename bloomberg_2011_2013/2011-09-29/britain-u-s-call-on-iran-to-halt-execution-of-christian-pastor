The U.K. and the U.S. urged  Iran  to
overturn a death sentence imposed on an Iranian Christian pastor
for apostasy.  Youcef Nadarkhani, a member of the Protestant evangelical
church in the Islamic republic, faces a death sentence for
refusing to recant his faith.  “I deplore reports that Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani, an
Iranian church leader, could be executed imminently after
refusing an order by the  Supreme Court  of Iran to recant his
faith,”  Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement on
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website.  “This demonstrates the Iranian regime’s continued
unwillingness to abide by its constitutional and international
obligations to respect religious freedom,” the statement said.
“I pay tribute to the courage shown by Pastor Nadarkhani who
has no case to answer and call on the Iranian authorities to
overturn his sentence.”  In  Washington , the Obama administration also condemned the
action and called for Nadarkhani’s release.  “A decision to impose the death penalty would further
demonstrate the Iranian authorities’ utter disregard for
religious freedom, and highlight Iran’s continuing violation of
the universal rights of its citizens,” White House press
secretary  Jay Carney  said in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
