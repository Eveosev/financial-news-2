Asia  fuel oil ’s discount to crude
shrank to the smallest in more than seven months. Royal Dutch
Shell Plc bought gasoil and gasoline in Singapore, where a fire
at its biggest refinery continued for a second day.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Asian benchmark Dubai crude narrowed
$1.23 to $3.06 a barrel at 2:19 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. That’s the smallest gap
since Feb. 24, indicating reduced losses for refiners turning
crude into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade declined 50 cents to $7 a metric ton, PVM data showed.
This viscosity spread is the narrowest since Aug. 23, meaning
fuel oil has fallen more than bunker, or marine fuel.  Middle Distillates  Shell bought 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 10 parts-per-
million of sulfur from Hin Leong Trading Pte, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring transactions on the
Platts window.  Europe ’s largest oil company paid $2.90 a barrel
above quotes, up from a $2.80 premium in a transaction
yesterday.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude rose $1.35 to $17.57 a
barrel at 2:19 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. This crack
spread, a measure of refining profit, widened the most since
Sept. 16.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil fell 10 cents to $1.30 a
barrel, PVM said. This regrade dropped for the third day,
meaning it is less profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Vitol Group sold 100,000 barrels of jet fuel to BP Plc for
a second day, the survey showed. The cargo changed hands at 10
cents a barrel below quotes, from a 30-cent discount yesterday.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
dropped $8.81 to $129.33 a ton at 6 p.m. Singapore time, based
on data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread fell for the
first time in three days.  In Singapore, Shell bought 50,000 barrels of 95-RON
gasoline from BP at $120.60 a barrel, according to the survey.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha increased $1.45 to $18.25 a
barrel, Bloomberg data showed. A rising reforming margin
indicates motor fuel is more profitable to produce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
