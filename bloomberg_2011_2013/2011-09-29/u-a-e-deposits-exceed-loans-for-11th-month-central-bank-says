United Arab Emirates’ overall bank
deposits exceed loans for an 11th month in August, the central
bank on its  website today .  Loans rose 0.5 percent in August from July to 1,056.8
billion dirhams ($288 billion), while deposits dropped 3.2
percent 1,078.4 billion dirhams, the data said. Specific
provisions for bad loans rose 1.7 percent in August from July to
49.2 billion dirhams, the data showed.  “Things domestically have improved and normalized to an
extent,” said  Marios Maratheftis , Dubai-based chief economist
for the  Middle East  at Standard Chartered Plc. “We had loans
exceeding deposits for a long time, that was worrisome as it was
a sign that banks did not really have room to resume credit
growth.”  The U.A.E. has sought to boost bank lending after the
global crisis squeezed a credit market that had been growing
more than 30 percent annually in the previous three years. In
response, the government guaranteed all local bank deposits and
interbank loans, created a 50 billion-dirham credit facility and
said it would pump 70 billion dirhams into banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
