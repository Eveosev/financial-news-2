Argentina â€™s 2012 budget proposal
overstates the primary fiscal surplus by almost 3 percentage
points of gross domestic product, Barclays said in a report
today.  The primary fiscal surplus will reach about 2.1 percentage
points of GDP in 2011, the report said. The proposal also
underestimates the levels of spending and revenue, Barclays
analyst Sebastian Vargas wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
