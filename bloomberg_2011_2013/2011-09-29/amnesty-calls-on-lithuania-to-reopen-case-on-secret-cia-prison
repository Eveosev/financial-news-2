Amnesty International  called on
 Lithuania  to reopen an investigation into a secret Central
Intelligence Agency prison in the Baltic country as new evidence
of a rendition flight emerged.  Amnesty International and other human rights groups
uncovered a flight from  Morocco  to Lithuania, which landed in
the capital of Vilnius on Feb. 17, 2005, that may have carried
Abu Zubaydah, an al-Qaeda suspect, the organization said in a
press conference in Vilnius today.  The Lithuanian general prosecutor’s office closed its pre-
trial investigation in January on the secret prison operations
in Lithuania, citing a lack of evidence. Amnesty International
said Lithuania’s probe on possible human rights violations was
incomplete.  “We come with concern that the information that
prosecutors had wasn’t fully investigated,” said Julia Hall,
Amnesty’s expert on counter-terrorism and human rights. “We
have information that leads to credible allegations that Abu
Zubaydah was here.”  A Lithuanian parliamentary commission said in December it
had evidence to show that security department officials allowed
the CIA to operate a secret prison in the Baltic state between
2022 and 2006 to detain terrorist suspects.  Lithuanian officials provided two sites and a logistics
system for secret detention. The panel said it had no “firm
evidence” that the prison was used for its original purpose to
interrogate terrorist suspects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
