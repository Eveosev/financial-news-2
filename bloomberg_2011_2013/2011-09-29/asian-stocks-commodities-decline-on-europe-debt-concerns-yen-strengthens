Asian stocks fell for the first
time in three days, the dollar and yen strengthened, and
commodities extended yesterday’s declines amid concern European
policy makers will struggle to stem the region’s debt crisis.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.1 percent as of 9:44
a.m. in  Tokyo . Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures slid 0.6
percent. The dollar climbed against 12 of its 16 major peers.
The yen gained 0.2 percent to 103.52 per euro. Oil dropped 1.5
percent to $79.98 a barrel in  New York , copper sank 5.5 percent
to $6,855 a metric ton in  London , and immediate-delivery gold
decreased 1.1 percent to $1,590.60 an ounce.  Concern Greece will default on its debt is dragging global
equities and commodities toward their biggest quarterly losses
since 2008, when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy
froze credit markets. The European Commission is resisting a
push to impose bigger writedowns on bank holdings of Greek
sovereign debt than those previously agreed on, a European
official said.  “The market is priced for some kind of Lehman-like
event,” Brian Barish, the Denver-based president of Cambiar
Investors LLC, which oversees about $8 billion, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “It’s clear that this is coming
to a head. If for some reason,  Greece  goes into an uncontrolled
default and it spreads to  Italy , which is a $3 trillion  bond
market , I don’t know how you’re going to put Humpty Dumpty back
together again in terms of the world economy.”  Stocks Slide  About two shares fell for every one that gained on MSCI’s
Asia Pacific Index, which snapped a two-day, 4.4 percent rally.
The gauge has dropped 17 percent this quarter, on course for its
largest quarterly loss since the three months ended September
2008.  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 0.9 percent,
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 1.7 percent and South
Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.7 percent.  Futures expiring in December indicate the S&P 500 may
extend yesterday’s 2.1 percent drop.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)

processors for personal computers cut its forecasts for third-
quarter sales and profits, citing glitches.  German lawmakers will vote today on changes to the European
Financial Stability Facility. The plan before the lower house in
Berlin would allow the fund to buy bonds of distressed states

loans to governments.  Italy will auction as much as 9 billion euros ($12.2
billion) of bonds today. Italy’s five-year credit-default swaps
