Any attempt by policy makers to
alter  Greece ’s proposed voluntary swap of government debt
securities would be likely to weigh on the euro, according to
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  “The rollover created a storm of argument and market
upheaval when it was first proposed,” said Greg Gibbs, a
currency strategist in Sydney. “Reopening this wound creates a
sense that political resolve and cohesion to deal with the
sovereign debt crisis is still not great enough. The market’s
patience with European policy makers is thin and any sign of
delay and reluctance to support the European Monetary Union is
negative for the euro.”  The euro rose 1 percent to $1.3671 at 9:21 a.m. in London,
after trading at an eight-month low of $1.3363 on Sept. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
