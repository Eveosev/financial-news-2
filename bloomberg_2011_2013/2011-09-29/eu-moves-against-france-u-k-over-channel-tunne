The European Commission is
investigating whether  France  and the U.K. properly implemented
measures to “open the market” for rail services through the
Channel Tunnel.  The commission sent the two countries letters setting out
concerns that the rules may not have been fully applied, the
regulator said in a statement on its website. It has given them
a two-month deadline to respond.  The U.K. and France must ensure fees for providing services
through the tunnel are “non-discriminatory” and that an
independent regulator is set up to “remedy competition
problems,” the commission said. Failure to address the concerns
within 2 months “will result in further measures against these
two countries,” it said.  Governments across the European Union were supposed to
implement rules to open rail service markets in the 27-nation
region by March 15, 2003. Failing to apply the requirements in
the case of the Channel Tunnel could “prevent the creation of
an internal market for rail services in  Europe ,” the commission
said.  Groupe Eurotunnel SA (GET)  operates the tunnel.  “We will consider the issues raised by the commission and
respond appropriately,” the U.K. government’s office in
Brussels said in an e-mailed statement.  The French government offices in Brussels declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
