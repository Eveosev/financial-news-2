Rye Select Broad Market XL
Portfolio Ltd., sued by the liquidator of Bernard Madoff’s firm,
asked a federal district judge to take the case out of  U.S.
bankruptcy court , citing a ruling on the trustee’s $1 billion
lawsuit against the owners of the  New York  Mets.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff this week cut to about
$386 million the amount at stake in trustee Irving Picard’s case
against the Major League Baseball team owners, Fred Wilpon and
Saul Katz. Cayman Islands-based Rye said its case was a similar
one involving Madoff customers’ securities transactions, and
that the district court sided with the defendants saying such
settlement payments were protected by so-called safe harbor law.  Rye is a defendant in a larger lawsuit involving transfers
of funds allegedly originating at the Madoff money management
firm, via swap transactions, according to Picard’s lawsuit.
Picard is seeking the return of $400 million from Rye.  David Sheehan , a lawyer for Picard, told reporters after a
court hearing yesterday that Rakoff’s ruling would cut the
amount of money the trustee could recover for investors who lost
money in the  Ponzi scheme .  The bankruptcy court case is Picard v. ABN Amro Bank
(Ireland), 10-ap-05355, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
