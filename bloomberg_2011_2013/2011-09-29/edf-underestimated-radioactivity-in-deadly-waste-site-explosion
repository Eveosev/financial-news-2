Electricite de France SA,  Europe ’s
biggest power producer, underestimated radioactivity levels in a
furnace that exploded at a waste-processing site this month,
killing one and injuring four, the nuclear watchdog said.  EDF has been told to explain how it gave incorrect data,
Autorite de Surete Nucleaire said in a statement, adding that
the immediate environment and population were unaffected by the
events. The watchdog had previously sought safety improvements
at the facility, while allowing it to continue to operate.  The regulator gave the incident a rating of level 1 on the
International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale. In contrast,
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi and Chernobyl events were rated level 7.  French authorities are still investigating the Sept. 12
accident at EDF’s Centraco plant in southern  France . One of the
injured workers, none of whom were contaminated with radiation,
remains in hospital, according to the nuclear watchdog.  Some 4 metric tons of metal with 30 million becquerels of
radioactivity was in the melting furnace of the plant at the
time of the accident, it said. The operator had initially said
the level of radioactivity was 63,000 becquerels.  “It was a serious industrial accident,” the authority
said, adding that it has given approval for furnaces at the site
to be restarted after closing them following the accident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
