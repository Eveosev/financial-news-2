Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  won a
jury’s verdict that a patent asserted by Solvay SA on technology
to replace ozone-depleting  chlorofluorocarbon  refrigerants is
invalid.  Solvay, based in Brussels, sued Morris Township, New
Jersey-based Honeywell in 2006 claiming infringement. The  U.S.
Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit in  Washington , ruling
on an earlier decision that Honeywell infringed the patent, had
ordered further proceedings.  Jurors in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, said today
that the patent wasn’t valid because the invention was
anticipated by another patent and by a 1994 application,
according to court papers. Part of the description was obvious,
the jury said.  “Honeywell is pleased that the jury found Solvay’s patent
to be invalid,” Peter F. Dalpe, a Honeywell spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement. “Honeywell has always defended its
rights and will continue to do so vigorously.”  Neil Hirsch, a U.S.-based spokesman for Solvay, didn’t
immediately respond an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling.  Honeywell fell 20 cents to $44.07 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at 2:25 p.m. Solvay rose 23 cents to
71.93 euros in Brussels.  The case is  Solvay SA (SOLB)  v. Honeywell International Inc.,
06CV557-SLR, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 6,730,817.  To contact the reporter on this story:
