International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  passed  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  in market value based on closing
share prices to become the world’s second-most valuable
technology company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  IBM rose $1.62 to $179.17 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange, giving it a market value of $214 billion. Microsoft
fell 13 cents to $25.45 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, giving it a
market value of $213.2 billion.  It’s the first time since 1996 that IBM closed ahead of
Microsoft, though IBM had passed the software company on an
intraday basis in May. Microsoft was worth three times as much
as IBM in 2000.  IBM Chief Executive Officer  Sam Palmisano  divested the
company’s PC business six years ago, calling it commoditized, to
invest in software and services. Microsoft, whose Windows and
Office software are used primarily on PCs, lost its spot as the
most valuable technology company last year to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , as
sales of iPad tablets and iPhones crimped PC demand. Apple is
now the world’s most valuable company, with a market value of
$422.9 billion.  IBM’s stock has gained 22 percent this year, while
Microsoft’s has dropped 9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
