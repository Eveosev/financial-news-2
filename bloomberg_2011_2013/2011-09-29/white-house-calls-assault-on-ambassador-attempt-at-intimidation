An attempted attack by a mob on the
U.S. ambassador in Syria was an “unwarranted and
unjustifiable” attempt at intimidation, White House press
secretary  Jay Carney  said.  Ambassador  Robert Ford , a critic of President Bashar al-
Assad, was in the office of opposition lawyer Hasan Abdul-Azim
when a mob surrounded it. Ford and other embassy officials
managed to escape.  “This is clearly a part of an ongoing campaign to
intimidate an threaten diplomats attempt to bear witness to the
brutality of the Assad regime,” Carney said at a briefing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
