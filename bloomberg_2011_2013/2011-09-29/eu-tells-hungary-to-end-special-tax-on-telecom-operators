Hungary will defy a European Union
request to abolish a special tax on telecommunication operators
designed to narrow the  budget deficit , a government official
said.  The Cabinet of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  sees “no
reason” to end the special levy and stands ready to face action
in the EU Court of Justice,  Peter Szijjarto , the prime
minister’s spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The commission called on Hungary earlier today to scrap the
tax, which is “illegal under EU telecoms rules because revenue
from the taxes is used for the government’s central budget and
not for meeting the specific costs of regulating the telecoms
sector,” according to a commission  statement .  The government has two months to take measures to comply
with the ruling, the commission said, adding that it may refer
 Hungary  to the EU Court of Justice if the cabinet fails to do
so.  The special tax of up to 6.5 percent of gross revenue
“gives companies the opportunity to share the social burden in
a proportionate manner,” Szijjarto said.  Orban imposed special taxes on energy, financial, retail
and telecommunications companies last year, one of several
measures to cut the deficit characterized by Orban as
“unorthodox.”  The Cabinet may reduce the special levies while extending
them beyond 2012, Janos Lazar, head of the ruling Fidesz party’s
parliamentary group, said on July 15.  Magyar Telekom Nyrt., Hungary’s former phone monopoly
controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG, jumped as much as 7 percent
to 505 forint, the steepest increase since May 10, 2010, after
the announcement of the EU decision.  To contact the reporters on this story:
