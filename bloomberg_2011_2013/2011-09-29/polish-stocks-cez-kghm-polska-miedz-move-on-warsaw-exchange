Poland’s WIG20 Index fell 1.05, or
less than 0.1 percent, and was little changed at 2,180.54 at
9:54 a.m. in Warsaw after a 23 percent decline this quarter.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)   headed for the highest close in a week in
Warsaw trading, increasing 2 zloty, or 1.6 percent, to 129
zloty. The largest Czech utility was upgraded to “overweight”
from “neutral” at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, declined for a second day, losing
1 zloty, or 0.7 percent, to 133.7 zloty. Copper fell before
German lawmakers vote on changes to a European bailout fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
