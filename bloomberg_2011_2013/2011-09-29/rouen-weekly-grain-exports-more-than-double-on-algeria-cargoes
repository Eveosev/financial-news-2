Grain loadings for export from the
French port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, more
than doubled in the seven days through yesterday as  Algeria  took
the most wheat in more than a year.  Outbound shipments were 225,286 metric tons between Sept.
22 and 28, climbing from 104,278 tons a week earlier, the  Seine
River port  said in an e-mailed report today. Departing cargoes
included 222,286 tons of wheat, the most in six months.  Algeria, the biggest buyer of French grain, was the main
destination with 148,888 tons of wheat, up from 82,470 tons a
week earlier and the most since at least the start of August
2010, port data show. Cargoes from Rouen included 38,670 tons of
wheat for  Libya , also the most in at least a year.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s wheat exports in
2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay, which shipped
out 19 percent, according to data from national crops office
FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
