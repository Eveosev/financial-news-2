Europe  will face growing “chaos”
unless its politicians “don’t start acting and stop the
cacophony,”  Nouriel Roubini , co-founder and chairman of Roubini
Global Economics LLC, said today at a conference in Sopot,
Poland.  “There’s too much focus on fiscal austerity, which is
important, but first you have to restore economic growth,”
Roubini said in a panel discussion at the European Forum of New
Ideas.  Roubini said Greece should be allowed to leave the euro
area in order to restore its competitiveness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
