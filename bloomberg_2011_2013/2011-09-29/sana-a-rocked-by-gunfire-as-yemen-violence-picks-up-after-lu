Plumes of smoke were seen above the
skyline of the Yemeni capital as heavy gunfire broke a lull in
violence that spiked after President Ali Abdullah Saleh returned
to the country last week.  At least one person died and five were wounded today when
the home of Himiar al-Ahmar, deputy speaker of parliament, in
Sana’a was targeted by the Republican Guards, according to the
Al-Sahwa opposition website. Himiar is the brother of Sadiq al- Ahmar, head of the Hashid tribal confederation and a key
opposition leader.  Civilians living near the state television building said
their homes were hit by random shells. Mohammed al-Jamali, a
resident, said at least one civilian was killed. “We appeal to
the international community and human rights organizations to
intervene to protect our lives,” he said.  Saleh returned to Yemen on Sept. 23 after three months
abroad and called for talks with opposition groups who are
seeking his ouster. The leaders of street demonstrations, which
resumed today in Sana’a, have called for the president to be
arrested over his violent suppression of protests.  The demonstrations in the Arab world’s poorest country
began at the end of January, inspired by revolts in Tunisia and
 Egypt , and deepened as military and tribal leaders joined the
opposition. Efforts by Gulf Arab countries to broker a power-
transfer agreement have failed.  Saleh spent his time abroad in neighboring  Saudi Arabia 
receiving medical treatment for injuries sustained in an attack
on his compound in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
