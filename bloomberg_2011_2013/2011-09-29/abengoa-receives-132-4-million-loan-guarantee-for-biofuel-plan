Abengoa SA (ABG) , Spain’s largest
biofuels developer, received a $132.4 million U.S. loan
guarantee to build a cellulosic ethanol plant in  Kansas .  The plant, in Hugoton, Kansas, will convert 300,000 tons of
corn stalks and leaves into 23 million gallons (87 million
liters) of ethanol a year, the U.S. Energy Department said in a
statement today. The plant will be powered by a 20-megawatt
biomass electric generator, fueled by leftover plant material.  Lawmakers in Washington are scrutinizing the Energy
Department’s loan-guarantee program in the wake of Solyndra
LLC’s Sept. 6 bankruptcy filing. The solar-panel maker, based in
Fremont, California, received a $527 million loan guarantee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
