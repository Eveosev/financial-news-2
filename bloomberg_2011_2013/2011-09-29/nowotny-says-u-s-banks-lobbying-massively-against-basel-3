European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said U.S. banks are lobbying
“massively” against the implementation of the Basel 3 rules.  “From the European side we need to be clear that if that
attitude spreads it would represent a massive backlash for a
unified, open and liberalized capital market,” Nowotny said in
Vienna today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
