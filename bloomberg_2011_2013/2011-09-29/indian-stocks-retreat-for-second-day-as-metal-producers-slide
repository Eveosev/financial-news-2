Indian stocks climbed, tracking a
rebound in Asian equities, on optimism German lawmakers will
approve the expansion of a bailout fund for  Europe ’s debt-
stricken nations, and as a top government official said the
South Asian economy may “turn around soon.”  Infosys Ltd. rallied 3.3 percent, pacing advances among
software services exporters on speculation a decline in the
rupee will make them more competitive. India is a “haven of
relative safety,”  Kaushik Basu , chief economic adviser in the
 finance ministry , said today.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) ,  Asia ’s second-largest
cigarette maker by market value, advanced 2.7 percent.  “We have seen a substantial sell-off and this is the time
for investors to pick stocks,” Gurunath Mudlapur, managing
director at Atherstone Capital Markets Ltd. in Mumbai, said by
phone. “Markets are tired of getting negative news.”  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, jumped 252.05
points, or 1.5 percent, to 16,698.07 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, its highest level since Sept. 21. The measure’s gain
outweighed speculation the central bank may increase borrowing
costs further after food inflation accelerated for the first
time in four weeks.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index reversed losses of as much as
1.3 percent, gaining 0.4 percent to 114.27. The S&P CNX Nifty
Index on the National Stock Exchange of  India  Ltd. advanced 1.4
percent to 5,015.45, while its October futures traded at 5,036.
The BSE 200-Index added 1.1 percent to 2,054.98.  German lawmakers backed an enhanced euro-area rescue fund
minutes after Indian markets closed as European officials turn
to look at what next steps may be needed to stem the region’s
debt crisis.  Quarterly Performance  The Sensex has declined 19 percent this year on concern the
European crisis, slowing U.S. growth and the Reserve Bank of
India’s record series of rate increases will crimp company
earnings. The measure has retreated 11 percent this quarter, set
for its steepest loss since the three months ended December
2008. Sensex companies trade at 14.1 times future profits,
compared with 9.5 times on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Overseas funds turned net sellers of Indian equities on
Sept. 26, according to  data  from the market regulator. They
withdrew a net $2.4 billion from local stocks in August, the
biggest outflow since October 2008.  The  Reserve Bank  has increased borrowing costs by a total
of 350 basis points starting mid-March 2010 to tame the fastest
inflation among the so-called BRICS economies.  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao last raised rates by 25 basis
points to 8.25 percent on Sept. 16 as wholesale-price inflation
reached a 13-month high of 9.78 percent in August, staying above
9 percent for a ninth straight month.  Food Costs  An index measuring wholesale prices of farm products rose
9.13 percent in the week ended Sept. 17 from a year ago, the
trade ministry said today. The gauge climbed 8.84 percent the
previous week.  Concern over a possible Greek default is dragging global
stocks toward the biggest quarterly loss since 2008. Global
investors anticipate Europe’s debt crisis leading to an economic
slump, a financial meltdown and social unrest in the next year,
with 72 percent predicting a country abandoning the euro as a
currency within five years, a Bloomberg survey found.  “There is a risk-aversion trade going on globally,” Mohit Mirchandani, head of investments, portfolio management services
at Religare Asset Management Co., said by phone from Mumbai.
“As long as the global uncertainty remains, there is likely to
be a flight of capital from riskier assets, including emerging-
market equities.”  Weak Rupee  Infosys, the second-largest software services provider,
rallied 3.3 percent to 2,551.10 rupees, the highest since Aug.
5.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest, gained 1.3
percent to 1,061.45 rupees. India’s rupee weakened 0.4 percent
to 48.93 per dollar as of 4:24 p.m. in Mumbai.  The currency completed its worst week in 18 years on Sept.
23, losing 4.6 percent. A weaker rupee boosts earnings of top
Indian software exporters such as Infosys and TCS, which get
about three-quarters of their revenue from overseas, mostly the
U.S. and Europe.  ITC climbed 2.6 percent to 202.25 rupees, the highest since
Sept. 6. The company bought a 26 percent stake in a 275-room,
five-star luxury hotel property being developed by Noida-based
Logix Group, Economic Times reported today, citing a person it
didn’t identify.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , India’s second-largest private lender,
advanced 2.8 percent to 470.60 rupees, the most since Sept. 7,
while  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the largest private lender, advanced 2.5
percent to 890.70 rupees.  Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. (JPA) , a builder
of dams, surged 6.8 percent to 74.75 rupees, its highest close
since July 26.  Foreign funds bought a net 887 million rupees ($18 million)
of stocks on Sept. 27, paring their outflow from local stocks
this year to 5.44 billion rupees, according to data from the
market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
