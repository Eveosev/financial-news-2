What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on concern that dry weather in
the southern U.S. Great Plains may delay planting and hamper
development of the winter crop, Mike Zuzolo, the president of
Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting LLC in Lafayette,
Indiana, said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher after a U.S.  report  today indicated rising import demand
in China and other Asian countries, Zuzolo said. A decline by
the dollar and positive signs for the U.S. economy may bolster
consumer and investor sentiment, he said.  -- Soybean futures may open down 3 cents a bushel to 3 cents a
bushel higher in Chicago as  China â€™s import demand increases amid
prospects for rain to improve soil conditions for planting in
South America, Zuzolo said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open down 0.05 cent to 0.1 cent a pound, and soybean-meal
futures may open 50 cents to $1 lower for 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
