Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency is seeking to hire advisers to help sell its U.S. and
European loan portfolios.  NAMA is likely to appoint six advisers in  Europe  and four
in the U.S., the Dublin-based agency said in  documents  published
yesterday.  “Loan sales will form a major part of our strategy going
forward, now that we are almost through the debtor business
plans and now that we’ve gleaned considerable knowledge about
the assets and the debtors,” NAMA Chief Executive Officer
Brendan McDonagh said in a speech in Dublin today.  NAMA acquired 71.2 billion euros ($97 billion) of assets
from Irish banks in 2010 and 2011 and expects to obtain 1.9
billion euros more in the fourth quarter, according to the
documents, which were distributed to potential advisers. It
plans to sell 25 percent of its loan book by the end of 2013,
according to its  business plan  posted on its website.  NAMA has acquired about 600 million euros worth of loans
linked to assets in the U.S. and 30 billion euros of loans
related to assets in the U.K. and Europe, the agency said in a
statement today.  The market value of its U.K. property portfolio was 8.2
billion euros in November 2009, according to NAMA’s 2010 annual
report. Property in the rest of Europe was valued at 1.5 billion
euros and in the U.S. and  Canada  was 300 million euros.  NAMA is seeking advice on the “overall planning, strategy,
timing and tactics for the loan sale,” NAMA said in the
documents. The advisers would also provide guidance on the
“credibility of different bids.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
