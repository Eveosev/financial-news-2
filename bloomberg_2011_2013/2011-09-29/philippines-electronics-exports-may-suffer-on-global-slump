 Philippine Budget Secretary Butch
Abad said  Europe  must take a “more decisive action” as a slump
in the region along with the U.S. will hurt the country’s
electronics exports.  “The situation out there is volatile,” Abad told
reporters in  Manila  today. The Southeast Asian nation will keep
its budget deficit ceiling this year at 300 billion pesos, he
said.  -- With assistance from Clarissa Batino.  To contact the reporter on this story:
