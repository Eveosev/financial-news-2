Air France-KLM (AF)  Group,  Europe ’s
largest airline, is investigating a “serious” incident at the
Casablanca airport in Morocco, where a passenger aircraft
touched down on the wrong landing strip,  Europe 1 radio 
reported, citing a spokesman for the airline.  The incident took place in August and Air France has been
questioning its staff, the French radio station reported on its
Web site. This is the third time in two years a plane lands on
the wrong lane at Casablanca’s Mohammed V airport, Europe 1
said, without citing other airlines that may have been involved.
The lane is no longer in use, according to Europe 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
