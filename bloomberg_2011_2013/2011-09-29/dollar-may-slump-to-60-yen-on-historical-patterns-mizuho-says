The dollar may slump to 60 yen
after falling to a postwar low versus the Japanese currency last
month, based on trading patterns over the past 40 years, Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. said.  The U.S. currency has bottomed out about 30 percent below
its previous low on four occasions since 1971 and is poised for
a fifth plunge, said  Hiroyuki Tanaka , chief technical analyst at
the unit of Japan’s third-largest listed bank. The dollar fell
by 100, 80, 60 and 40 yen in the past four declines, with the
size of the drop shrinking by 20 yen each time, he said.  “The dollar’s four historical nadirs since 1971 are
connected by a certain pace of decline,” Tanaka said. “This
time, the dollar may slide by about 20 yen from the previous
bottom of 79.75 yen.”  The dollar was 360 yen until U.S. President  Richard Nixon 
ended the gold standard in August 1971. The currency has
bottomed four times since then, at 254.45 yen in March 1973,
177.05 yen in October 1978, 121.25 yen in December 1987 and
79.75 yen in April 1995. The greenback reached a post World War
II low of 75.95 yen on Aug. 19, even after  Japan  intervened in
the  currency market  to sell yen and its central bank expanded
monetary stimulus on Aug. 4.  Dollar-yen exchange rates are mostly driven by the dollar
rather than the yen, Tanaka said. As Treasury 10-year yields,
which determine the flow of long-term investment, reach a low
every five years, the greenback may weaken to about 60 yen in
2013, he said.  50 Percent Drop  The dollar has also fallen by at least 50 percent from peak
levels three times in the past 40 years and it’s “highly
likely” that the U.S. currency is headed for a fall of similar
magnitude, Tanaka said.  The greenback slid from 360 yen to 177.05 yen in October
1978, from 277.65 in November 1982 to 121.25 in December 1987,
and from 160.20 in April 1990 to 79.75 in April 1995, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Its peak following the 1995 low was 147.66 yen in August
1998. The currency was as high as 124.14 yen in June 2007,
before the onset of the global financial crisis that followed
the collapse of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  in 2008.  The dollar has fallen 11 percent from this year’s high of
85.53 yen in April amid a worsening European debt crisis and as
Standard & Poor’s Rating Services downgraded the U.S.’s credit
rating for the first time ever following a protracted debate
over raising the country’s debt ceiling.  The dollar will trade at 77 yen by year-end and rise to 82
yen about a year from now, according to the median estimates of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The currency traded at 76.50 yen
at 10 a.m. in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
