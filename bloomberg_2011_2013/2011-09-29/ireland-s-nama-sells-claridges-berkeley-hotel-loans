Connaught and the Berkeley.  The agency sold the loans for in excess of 800 million
euros, it said in a statement today. The loans were acquired by
a company controlled by David and  Frederick Barclay .  The loans had been provided by two Irish banks to fund the
acquisition of the hotels in 2005, and were acquired by NAMA in
June 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
