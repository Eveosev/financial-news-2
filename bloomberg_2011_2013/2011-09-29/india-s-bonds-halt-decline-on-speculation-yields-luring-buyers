India ’s 10-year bonds snapped a
three-day losing streak on speculation yields near the highest
level in almost two weeks will lure buyers.  Benchmark 10-year yields have jumped 35 basis points since
the beginning of the fiscal year on April 1 as inflation stayed
above 9 percent during the period, official data show. The
central bank has raised the repurchase rate by 1 percentage
point since April to 8.25 percent. Wholesale-price inflation
accelerated to a 13-month high of 9.78 percent in August.  “There are no new known risks that the market is concerned
about,” said  Roy Paul , a Mumbai-based deputy general manager of
treasury at Federal Bank Ltd. “So yields may curb the rise.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent securities due April 2021
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.34
percent as of 9:20 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate reached 8.35 percent yesterday,
the highest level since Sept. 16.  Consumer-price gains in the world’s second-most populous
nation remain above the level the central bank deems acceptable,
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said this week.  “Inflation has been fairly stubborn,” Subbarao  said  in
New York Sept. 26. “Above a threshold, you can’t accept high
inflation to have higher growth.”  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
dropped two basis points to 7.85 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
