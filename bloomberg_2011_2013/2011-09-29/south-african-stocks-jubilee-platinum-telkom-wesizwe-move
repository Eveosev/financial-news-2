The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
fell for a second day, declining 650.14, or 2.1 percent, to
29,688.89 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. The index has
retreated 6.8 percent this quarter, a second decrease.  The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  African Dawn Capital Ltd. (ADW)  , a financial services
company, rose the most since at least February 2005, surging 6
cents, or 67 percent, to 15 cents. Earnings per share for the
six months through August climbed as much as 136 percent, the
company said in a trading statement.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the mining company that makes
up about 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , dropped for the
second day, sliding 4.04 rand, or 1.4 percent, to 282.10 rand.
Copper retreated for a second day in  London  on concern a global
recession will affect demand for industrial metals.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s largest mining
company, fell 4 rand, or 1.8 percent, to 217 rand.  Jubilee Platinum Plc (JBL)   gained for the first time in

June 30.  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK SJ), Africa’s biggest lender,
snapped two days of gains, falling 3.47 rand, or 3.6 percent, to
92.65 rand. The bank may buy  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc. (GUARANTY)  ,  Nigeria ’s second-biggest lender, as it grows its presence
in Africa’s second largest economy, analysts say.  Telkom South Africa Ltd. (TKG SJ), the South African fixed-
line operator controlled by the government, fell to its lowest
in more than seven years, losing 1.70 rand, or 5.1 percent, to
31.50 rand after saying fiscal first-half profit plunged.  Wesizwe (WEZ)  Platinum Ltd. (WEZ SJ) declined for the first day
in three, dropping 1 cent, or 0.6 percent, to 1.78 rand. The
