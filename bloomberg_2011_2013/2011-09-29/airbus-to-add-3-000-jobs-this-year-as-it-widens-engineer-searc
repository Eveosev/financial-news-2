Airbus SAS plans to add 3,000
workers this year as it recruits more engineers in preparation
for assembly of the A350 wide-body jet, the European
planemaker’s director of human resources said.  The company has added 2,000 people in the first nine months
and will to recruit another 1,000 by year-end, bringing the
full-time workforce to 55,000, Thierry Baril said in an
interview. Toulouse, France-based Airbus will likely set similar
goals in 2012, he said.  European universities turn out about 9,000 engineers
equipped for aerospace design each year, fewer than the 12,000
that would be required, Baril said. That’s forcing Airbus to
scour markets including  Latin America ,  India ,  Russia  and the
U.S. to fill the gap, Baril said.  “As there’s a risk of shortages, we’ve already started
organizing sourcing of jobs in other parts of the world,” Baril
said. Areas that Airbus finds hardest to fill include systems
engineering, structural engineering, composite design and stress
specialists, he said.  Airbus has opened engineering centers in India, Russia, and
the U.S., and the company is working to set up partnerships with
universities in  Brazil  to raise Airbus’s profile. Brazil has
become a center of engineering skills with the growth of
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest planemaker.  In Bangalore, India, Airbus already has 170 employees at an
engineering center that opened in 2007 and it plans to raise the
number to between 400 and 500 by 2015, Baril said. In the U.S.,
it has a total of 500 engineers spread between centers in
Wichita,  Kansas , opened in 2002, and Mobile, Alabama, opened in
2007. In Moscow, Airbus has 170 engineers.  Even within  Europe , Airbus is keen to diversify its
employee base and aims to hire 15 percent of non-nationals from
countries including France and  Germany , Baril said. Attracting
engineers in Germany is more challenging than in France because
aerospace jobs don’t have the same cache as car companies or
industrial manufacturers, Baril said.  “We’re making big efforts in Germany for aerospace to get
better recognition,” Baril said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
