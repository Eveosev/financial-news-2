South African producer-price
inflation accelerated in August as increases in the cost of
basic goods and a weaker currency that made imports more
expensive.  The cost of goods leaving factories and mines rose 9.6
percent from the year earlier after advancing 8.9 percent in
July, Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa  said on its website
today. The median estimate of 13 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 9.1 percent. Prices increased 1 percent in the
month.  “There has been some pressure from commodity prices,”
said  Kevin Lings , an economist at Stanlib Asset Management in
Johannesburg, said in a telephone interview before the data was
released. “It doesn’t mean that this will feed into consumer
inflation.”  Import costs rose after the rand declined the most in eight
months in August as the European debt crisis and indications
global economic growth is slowing led to a drop in risk
appetite. The currency weakened 4.1 percent last month, the most
since January, raising import costs.  Gasoline prices increased 1.7 percent on Aug. 3 and the
price of white corn, a staple in South Africa, surged 18 percent
last month on the South African Futures Exchange. South Africa
is the largest producer of platinum and chrome in the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
