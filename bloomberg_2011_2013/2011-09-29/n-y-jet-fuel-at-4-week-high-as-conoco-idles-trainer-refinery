Jet fuel in New York strengthened
to the highest level in four weeks as  ConocoPhillips (COP)  idled its
Trainer, Pennsylvania refinery.  Conoco expects processing activities to stop at the plant
by the end of the week,  Rich Johnson , a company spokesman, said
in an e-mail yesterday. The refinery can produce 65,000 barrels
a day of diesel, heating oil and jet fuel, according to the
company’s website.  The premium for jet fuel in New York Harbor versus heating
oil futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose 1.75
cents to 9 cents at 1:50 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s the highest level since Sept. 1. Prompt delivery
gained 3.1 cents to $2.9219 a gallon.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline at the same hub
strengthened 1.63 cents to a premium of 4.63 cents a gallon.
Prompt delivery rose 2.31 cents to $2.7038 a gallon.  Conoco will permanently close the Trainer plant in six
months if no buyer is found, the Houston-based company said on
Sept. 27.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. will shut an alkylation unit at
its Catlettsburg refinery in Kentucky Oct. 1 until Nov. 21 for
planned work, according to a filing with state regulators.
Sulfur recovery unit No. 1 will shut from Oct. 4 to Nov. 4,
according to the filing.  The discount for regular gasoline in the Midwest, or Group
3, narrowed 1 cent to 1.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
