Spain  and the Netherlands were
given a two-month deadline by the European Union to implement
changes to bank capital rules.  The Dutch government has yet to adopt the necessary
legislation to implement the measures, which include limits on
the amount of loans a bank can make to a single business, the
European Commission said. Spain needs to take “technical
measures” to complete its application of the rules, which also
curb banks’ counting of hybrid instruments such as subordinated
debt toward meeting their capital needs.  The requirements boost “the financial soundness of banks
and investment firms,” the commission said in a statement on
its  website  today. The commission may sue the countries at the
 European Court  of Justice if they don’t take “the necessary
implementing measures” within two months, it said.  EU regulators have sought to toughen the quality of banks’
reserves and risk management to prevent a repeat of the
financial crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2008. The measures that Spain and the
Netherlands have failed to implement are part of a batch of
changes to capital rules proposed by the commission in the
 immediate aftermath  of Lehman’s collapse.  The changes were supposed to be implemented across the 27-
nation EU by Oct. 31, 2010, the Brussels-based commission said.  The Dutch and Spanish governments’ offices in Brussels
declined to immediately comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
