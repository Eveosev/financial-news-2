Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-
largest planemaker, rose to a one-week high after  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  ordered five jets valued at a total of more than
$200 million, and Brazil’s government gave tax breaks to defense
suppliers, including aircraft builders.  Embraer advanced 1.6 percent to 11.78 reais at 4:15 p.m.
New York time, the highest since Sept. 21. The benchmark Bovespa
index gained 0.2 percent.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG,  Europe ’s second-biggest airline,
said it will buy five of Embraer’s 195 regional jets. The order
was part of a $1.5 billion capital expenditure program that
included seven aircraft from Airbus SAS, the German carrier said
today in a statement.  “Embraer has had the advantage of a weak currency and a
backlog in orders, which has been a surprise to the upside,”
Marcello Paixao,  money manager  at Sao Paulo-based quant fund
Principia Capital Management, said in a telephone interview.
“That combination has been a big plus because a lot of their
costs -- labor and energy -- are in reais, while the planes are
sold for foreign currency.”  The real was little changed at 1.8403 per dollar, from
1.8408 yesterday. The currency has lost 13 percent this month,
the worst performer among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  Brazil is giving a tax break to suppliers of defense
systems and products, including aircraft, satellites, vehicles
and software. Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff  signed a decree
today to enact the tax break.  To contact the reporter on this story:
