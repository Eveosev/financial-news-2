Ecuador’s gross domestic product
expanded 8.8 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
central bank President  Diego Borja  said, forecasting that growth
for the whole year would exceed the Finance Ministry’s 5.24
percent forecast.  The economy expanded 2.2 percent in the three months
through June from the previous quarter, Borja said today in a
speech in Quito.  Ecuador, South America’s seventh-biggest economy, has
benefitted from higher  oil prices  and Chinese loans which allow
the government to boost spending on labor-intensive public works
projects. A weaker U.S. dollar, the nation’s official currency,
has also made the country’s exports more competitive in
international markets, Quito-based think tank Quantum Informe
said in a Sept. 20 report.  “Ecuador’s positive economic outlook is sustained by the
high price of oil and the weakness of the dollar,” former
Finance Minister Alfredo Arizaga, chief economist at Quantum,
said in the report. “With the current level of income from oil,
it’s very unlikely that economic instability will be compromised
in the next six months.”  Ecuador, which defaulted on $3.2 billion of foreign bonds
in 2008 and 2009, had its credit rating outlook raised to
positive from stable by Standard & Poor’s Ratings on Aug. 4, on
better growth prospects because of increased oil revenue and
financing from  China . S&P rates Ecuador B-, six levels below
investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
