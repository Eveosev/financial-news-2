Russia neared completion of the
biggest banking bailout in the nation’s history as VTB Group
consolidated control of Bank of Moscow, allowing the government
to disburse a 294.8 billion-ruble ($9.2 billion) 10-year loan.  VTB, the country’s second-largest bank, increased its stake
to 80.57 percent and Bank of Moscow received the funds from the
Deposit Insurance Agency, the lenders said in separate
statements today.  State-run VTB bought the city government’s 46.5 percent
stake in Bank of Moscow for 103 billion rubles in February,
following President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s ouster of then-Moscow
Mayor Yury Luzhkov in September 2010 amid corruption
allegations. The bank will get a total of 395 billion rubles,
including a capital injection of 100 billion rubles from VTB.  Bank of Moscow plans to invest its loan in a one-off issue
of ruble-denominated government OFZ bonds. The  Finance Ministry 
will be “technically ready” tomorrow to place the bonds,
Interfax reported today, citing Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak.  VTB’s shares climbed 3.1 percent to 6.9 kopeks at the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow. Bank of Moscow advanced 5.3 percent to 894
rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
