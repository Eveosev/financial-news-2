U.K. electricity supplied from
renewable sources rose 50 percent in the second quarter from the
same period a year earlier as wind turbine installations  and
wind speeds increased.  The wind, hydropower and other renewables generated 7.9
terawatt-hours of power in the second quarter, or 9.6 percent of
all electricity supplied in the U.K., the Department for Energy
and Climate Change said today in an e-mailed  statement .
Electricity from  wind turbines  more than doubled from a year
earlier and hydropower gained 75 percent.  The U.K. aims to generate 30 percent of its electricity
from renewables by 2020 to help the nation meet a European Union
target of deriving 15 percent of all energy needs, including
heating and transportation fuels, from sources other than fossil
fuels and nuclear power in that time period.  “We’ve reached a historic high, with renewable energy now
providing almost 10 percent of the U.K.’s electricity,” Gordon Edge, director of policy at the lobby group RenewableUK, said in
an e-mailed statement. “We can expect the role of  wind energy 
to continue to grow, providing us with a secure alternative to
expensive fossil fuel imports.”  An increase in the number of turbines installed also
contributed to the growth in windpower, the energy department
said in a longer  report  on its website today. Hydropower rose
due to heavy rainfall after low precipitation caused it to dip
in 2010, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
