Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
President  Jeffrey Lacker  said he wasn’t convinced the central
bank should commit to a specific date for keeping interest rates
low, and didn’t believe more stimulus was needed, according to
an interview published today by Virginia Business.  “Low interest rates right now are warranted,” he was
quoted as saying during an interview in August, after the Fed
decided to keep the fed funds rate near zero until at least mid-
2013. “But I was hesitant about committing implicitly to a
particular date on the calendar,” he said, according to the
magazine.  Lacker doesn’t hold voting power this year on the Federal
Open Market Committee.  The  U.S. economy  will probably grow “very slowly and
haltingly” at a rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent “for some
time,” he said, according to the magazine.  Monetary policy 
can’t do much to help what ails the economy, said Lacker, adding
that he didn’t think “more stimulus is warranted right now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
