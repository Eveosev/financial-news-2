United Co. Rusal completed a $9.33
billion debt refinancing with lenders including OAO Sberbank,
 BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and ING Groep, reducing the curbs on dividends
that were a condition of the borrowings it replaced.  Rusal extended a $4.6 billion loan from Sberbank and agreed
to borrow $4.75 billion from another 13 lenders, the world’s
biggest aluminum producer said today in an e-mailed statement.
The prior borrowing was part of a $17 billion debt restructuring
in 2009 that imposed restrictions on payments to shareholders.  “Technically, we are in a position to pay dividends,”
Vera Kurochkina, a company spokeswoman, said today by phone.
“We need to refinance only $1 billion of debt now.” At the end
of the first half, Rusal’s net debt totaled $11.4 billion.  Before today’s completion, Sberbank had also agreed to
refinance $460 million of debt at 4.5 percent above the one-year
London interbank offered rate, Rusal said in a presentation last
month. A $655 million loan from OAO Gazprombank for refinancing
would pay interest of 4.5 percent above three-month Libor. Both
would mature in 2016, according to the presentation.  “The overall cost of our debt post-refinancing will be
slightly above 4 percent per annum,” Oleg Mukhamedshin, deputy
chief executive officer of the company, said this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
