Copper may rise on speculation this
week’s drop was overdone, considering forecasts of a shortage.  Five of 11 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 45 percent, said the metal will rise next week.
Four predicted lower prices and two forecast little change.
Copper for delivery in three months was down 2.2 percent this
week at $7,195.25 a metric ton as of 3:23 p.m. yesterday on the
London Metal Exchange.  Copper is down 24 percent this quarter, the most since
the last three months of 2008. Copper supply will lag behind
demand by 140,000 tons this year, Deutsche Bank AG forecasts.  The sell-off “has nothing whatsoever to do with the
fundamentals of copper,”  Donald Selkin , chief market strategist
at National Securities Corp. in  New York , said by e-mail.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The chart goes
to Sept. 23.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
75 of the past 156 weeks, or 48 percent of the time. China is
the biggest copper buyer, followed by the U.S.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 5 Bearish: 4 Hold: 2  To contact the reporter on this story:
