The U.S. Natural Gas Fund, the 
largest exchange-traded fund in the fuel, closed at a discount 
of 0.32 percent on Sept. 28, according to figures on the fundâ€™s
website. A discount means that the closing price of the shares
is lower than the value of its underlying holdings in the fuel.  Natural gas for November delivery fell 7.6 cents, or 2
percent, to $3.799 per million British thermal units on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  on Sept. 28.  NOTE: To sidestep position limits imposed by the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission, the fund buys bilateral,
over-the-counter swaps that are not subject to exchange
limits. These swaps are fully collateralized with investment
grade counterparties.   The fund aims to track the price of natural gas delivered
at  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana , the delivery point for the
future traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The ETF
buys the near-month contract, then rolls forward by selling it
before expiration and buying the following month.  SOURCE: United States Natural Gas Fund  To contact the reporter on this story:
