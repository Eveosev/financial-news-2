Belgian inflation eased for a
second month in September, helped by the declining cost of
vacations and hotel rooms.  The inflation rate in  Belgium , the sixth-largest economy in
the euro region, slowed to 3.55 percent from 3.6 percent in
August, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Brussels said today
in an e-mailed statement. The August rate fell from 3.8 percent
in July, the highest since October 2008.  Inflation this month was mainly driven by the higher cost
of gas, motor fuel and heating oil, the ministry said. Excluding
energy, inflation slowed to 1.68 percent this month from 1.81
percent in August, according to todayâ€™s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
