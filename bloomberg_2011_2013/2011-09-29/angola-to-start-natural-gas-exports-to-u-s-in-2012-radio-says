Angola’s first liquefied natural
gas plant will start operations on schedule in the first quarter
of next year,  Radio Nacional de Angola  reported on its website
yesterday, citing Angola LNG director Daniel Rocha.  Most of the $8 billion plant’s natural gas production will
be exported to the U.S., state-owned Radio Nacional cited Rocha
as saying. Angola LNG is also considering sales to European and
Asian markets, it said.  The plant has the potential to produce one billion cubic
feet of clean gas a day for domestic and international markets,
 according to the project’s website . Angola LNG is led by  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  and partners include  Total SA (FP) ,  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Eni SpA (ENI)  and
Angola’s state-owned Sonangol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
