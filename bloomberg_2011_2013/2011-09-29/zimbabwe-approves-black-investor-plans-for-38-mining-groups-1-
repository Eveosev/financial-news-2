Zimbabwe approved plans by 38
mining companies to sell majority stakes in their local
operations to black citizens, according to Saviour Kasukuwere,
the government minister in charge of the program.  “I am pleased to say that the deadline we set out has been
met by all major mining companies,” he told reporters today in
the capital, Harare.  Kasukuwere, the minister of youth development and economic
empowerment, said his ministry is still “trying to address”
proposals from the country’s banking industry.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ,  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  South Africa ’s
Standard Bank Group Ltd. are still to either submit plans or
have their proposals approved, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
