ALK-Abello A/S’s Pharmalgen won the
preliminary backing of the U.K.’s health-cost agency for the
treatment of severe reactions to bee and wasp stings.  As many as nine people die every year in the U.K. from
allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, to the stings, the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence said in an
e-mailed statement. Pharmalgen, an injection, prevents the
reaction by desensitizing the immune system, said the agency,
known as NICE.  A final decision probably will be made by February, NICE
said. ALK-Abello is based in Hoersholm,  Denmark .  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
