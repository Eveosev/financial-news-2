Former European Commission
President  Romano Prodi  said a default by Greece is “not an
advantage for anybody” and that public opinion in Germany has
changed to support the euro region’s rescue fund.  Today’s vote in Germany’s lower house, the Bundestag, on
approving upgrades to the European Financial Stability Facility
represents “great change” for the region’s biggest economy,
where public opinion has been slow to back bailout efforts,
Prodi said in an interview today on Bloomberg Television with
Francine Lacqua.  Nobody wants a break-up of the single-currency region,
Prodi added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
