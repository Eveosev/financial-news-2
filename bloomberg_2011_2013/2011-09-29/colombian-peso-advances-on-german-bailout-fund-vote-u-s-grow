Colombia ’s peso held near a nine-
month low as declines in U.S. equities eroded demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso erased gains, trading little changed at 1,917.65
per  U.S. dollar  at 3:21 p.m. New York time, from 1,917.32
yesterday. The currency touched 1,933 on Sept. 26, its lowest
intraday level since December. The peso has plunged 7.7 percent
since June 30, after rising in the first two quarters of 2011,
as concern the global economy is slipping into a recession hurt
risk appetite.  “The market is all over the place as investors struggle to
focus since there is no one key driver,” said  Camilo Perez ,
head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, Colombia’s second-biggest
bank.  U.S. stocks declined, erasing a 2.2 percent advance by the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as losses by consumer and
technology companies offset lower-than-estimated claims for
 unemployment benefits .  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
7.54 percent. The bond’s price rose 0.516 centavo to 119.765
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
