Wheat gained, reversing earlier
losses, on speculation that persistent dry weather in the U.S.
southern Great Plains will curb planting of the winter crop and
reduce production.  Little or no rain has fallen in parts of  Kansas ,  Oklahoma 
and  Texas , the biggest producers of winter varieties, in the
past 30 days, National Weather Service data show. Plants won’t
develop fully and roots won’t be able to establish in the dry
soil. Scant precipitation is expected in the next week, Telvent
DTN senior agriculture meteorologist Joel Burgio wrote in a
report.  “Little, if any, significant rain is projected for the
central and south plains during at least the next seven days,”
Burgio wrote. “We may see some increase in shower activity
during the eight- to 10-day period, but mostly for north and
east areas.”  Wheat for December delivery gained 4.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $6.435 a bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time, widening
the quarterly gain to 4.8 percent. Milling wheat for November
delivery fell 0.7 percent to 189.75 euros ($259.01) a metric ton
on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  Soybeans declined to the lowest level in more than 10
months on mounting concern that the global economy will weaken,
slowing demand for crops used in foods and fuels. November-
delivery soybeans lost 5.5 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $12.18 a
bushel in  Chicago . The price earlier touched $12.0925, the
lowest for the most-active contract since Nov. 23.  Corn for December delivery was unchanged at $6.3075 a
bushel in Chicago. The grain, which has dropped 18 percent this
month on speculation demand for raw materials would decline amid
a slumping global economy, has gained 1.7 percent this quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
