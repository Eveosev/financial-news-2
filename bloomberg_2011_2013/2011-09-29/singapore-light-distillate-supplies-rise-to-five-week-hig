Light-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
climbed 4.3 percent to the highest in five weeks, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore supplies, including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate, rose 394,000 barrels in the week to yesterday to 9.5
million barrels,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today
in an e-mailed statement. That’s the highest since the seven
days ended Aug. 24.  Stockpiles of middle distillates including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene increased 560,000 barrels, or 4.1 percent,
to 14.1 million. That’s a six-week high, based on the ministry’s
data.  Residual-fuel inventories, including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, climbed 4.8 percent
to 19.8 million barrels, a two-week high.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
