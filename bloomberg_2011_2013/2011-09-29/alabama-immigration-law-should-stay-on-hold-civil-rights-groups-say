New  Alabama  immigration laws
cleared for enforcement by a U.S. judge should be blocked until
a federal appeals court has reviewed legal challenges, a
coalition of civil rights groups said.  The  American Civil Liberties Union , Southern Poverty Law
Center and other groups today asked U.S. District Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn in Birmingham, Alabama, for an order staying
application of those laws she deemed enforcible in a trio of
rulings yesterday, while the organizations pursue an appeal.  Blackburn’s decision allows Alabama authorities to question
the status of people detained or arrested, upon reasonable
suspicion they’re in the U.S. illegally, and criminalizes an
illegal resident’s failure to carry alien-registration papers.  Enforcement of the provisions will cause irreparable harm
to people who have filed suit challenging the legislation signed
into law by Alabama Governor Robert Bentley on June 9, the
groups said in papers filed at the U.S. court in Birmingham
today.  In a separate filing, the organizations said they are
asking a federal appeals court in Atlanta to review Blackburn’s
decision.  The case is Hispanic Interest Coalition v. Bentley,
11cv2484, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama
(Birmingham).  The two related cases are Parsley v. Bentley, 5:11-cv-2736
and U.S. v. Bentley, 5:11-cv-2746, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Alabama (Birmingham).  To contact the reporter on this story:
