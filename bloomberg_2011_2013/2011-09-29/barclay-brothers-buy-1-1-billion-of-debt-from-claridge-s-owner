Paddy McKillen, who owns 36 percent
of Maybourne Hotel Ltd., has “no intention of selling his
stake” in the hotel group after the 800 million euro ($1.1
billion) sale of the company’s debt to David and  Frederick Barclay , according to his spokeswoman Breda Keena.  The brothers, owners of the Telegraph Media Group Ltd.,
bought the debt from Ireland’s National Asset Management Agency,
according to a statement on NAMA’s website today. London-based
Maybourne also owns the luxury Berkeley and Connaught hotels in
the U.K. capital.  McKillen “is investigating the deal and is concerned about
the effect it may have on his shareholding,” said Keena.  Two Irish banks loaned Maybourne money in 2005 for the
acquisition of hotels, NAMA said today, without identifying the
lenders. The Dublin-based government agency said it recovered
100 percent of the original value of the loans plus interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
