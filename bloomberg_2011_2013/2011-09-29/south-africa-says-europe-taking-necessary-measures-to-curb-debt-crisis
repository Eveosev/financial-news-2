European nations appear to be
taking necessary steps to deal with a worsening debt crisis and
a financial rescue package to prevent countries defaulting is
giving “some confidence” to the global economy, South African
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  Brazil, Russia, India, China and  South Africa , which are
members of the BRICS political group of emerging-market nations,
are willing to help the U.S. and Europe as economic growth
slows, Gordhan said in a speech to the French South
African Chamber of Commerce in Johannesburg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
