The biggest rout in copper since
the global recession drove analysts to cut their price forecasts
by 16 percent in a week as mounting concern about growth eroded
expectations for supply shortages.  The metal may drop as much as 10 percent to $6,500 a metric
ton by Dec. 31, according to the median in a Bloomberg survey of
16 analysts and traders. Their estimate was $7,773 a week ago.
Speculators in U.S. futures are making the biggest wager on
declining prices in more than two years, U.S. government data
show.  Barclays Capital  cut its forecast for the shortfall in
global supplies five times since April and Deutsche Bank AG is
anticipating a surplus as early as next year.  Commodities tumbled into a  bear market  this month, dropping
21 percent since April, on concern that slowing growth will curb
demand for raw materials. Prices had more than doubled since the
beginning of 2009 as surging consumption led by emerging markets
created shortages in everything from corn to copper to crude. As
many as 5,000 merchants will gather in the British capital from
Oct. 3 for London Metal Exchange week, an annual event during
which supply contracts are discussed.  “If you don’t have demand then you don’t need to talk
about shortages,” said  Robin Bhar , an analyst at Credit
Agricole SA in London who has followed the metals market for
about 25 years. “This is not a normal market. There is a lot of
fear out there. At the moment people are panicking. When you
panic, you don’t think rationally.”  Quarter Century  Copper, which reached a record $10,190 on the London Metal
Exchange in February, sank to $6,800 on Sept. 26, a 14-month
low. The contract traded at $7,067.50 today, taking this year’s
decline to 26 percent. The metal is on track for its second-
worst year in almost a quarter century, exceeded only by a 54
percent retreat in 2008.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities fell 5.6
percent this year, led by cotton, nickel and copper. The MSCI
All-Country Index of equities dropped 14 percent. Treasuries
maturing in 10 years or more returned 25 percent, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  Copper consumption fell 0.9 percent in 2008 as the global
economy contended with recession, driving supply into a surplus
from a shortage, Morgan Stanley estimates. Global stockpiles in
warehouses monitored by exchanges in London,  New York  and
 Shanghai  expanded 15 percent to 650,851 tons since the start of
January, a sign that demand may be weakening. Inventories are
about 50 percent higher than the average over the past five
years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Consuming Nation  This year’s gain in stockpiles still falls short of the
expansions seen during the global recession, when they rose 63
percent in 2008 and 78 percent in 2009. Monthly imports by
 China , the biggest consuming nation, rose 58 percent since
reaching a 2 1/2-year low in May, customs data show.  While China’s economic growth will slow to 9.3 percent this
year from 10.4 percent in 2010, it will still be almost six
times faster than the U.S., according to the median of as many
as 66 economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. China
accounts for about 38 percent of global copper demand, compared
with 8 percent for the U.S. and 15 percent for Western Europe,
Morgan Stanley estimates.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its global growth
forecasts to 4 percent for this year and next on Sept. 20,
compared with earlier estimates of 4.3 percent for 2011 and 4.5
percent in 2012. That would still exceed the 5.2 percent
contraction in gross domestic product that the  World Bank 
estimates took place in 2009.  ‘Different Today’  “So far in the real economy we’ve seen some caution and
less orders,” said Herwig Schmidt, head of sales at Triland
Metals Ltd., one of 12 companies trading on the floor of the
LME. The exchange handles about 80 percent of global
transactions in metals futures. “But you don’t see the impact
like we had seen in 2008 when suddenly 50 percent of all orders
were canceled. It is different today.”  Prices will advance to a record $11,000 in 12 months as
growth in emerging markets “suggest tightening copper
fundamentals,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s team of commodity
analysts said in a report Sept. 22. The bank is recommending
investors buy the LME’s June 2012 contract.  Production in  Chile , accounting for about 17 percent of
global refined supply, will probably decline this year because
of snowstorms and strikes, Mining Minister Hernan de Solminihac
said in a Sept. 5 interview.  Pipes and Appliances  Not everyone expects the shortages to persist. Supply may
fall 140,000 tons short of demand this year, moving into a
120,000-ton surplus next year, Deutsche Bank said in a report
Sept. 28. That’s enough metal to make wires, pipes and
appliances for about 600,000 U.S. homes, according to the Copper
Development Association.  Barclays Capital anticipates a shortfall of 468,000 tons
this year, down from a March estimate of 889,000 tons. With the
exception of June, when the bank widened its deficit forecast,
the estimate has been cut every month since April. Barclays’
commodities analysts expect a deficit of 153,000 tons in 2012.  Money managers held a net-short position of 6,672 U.S.
copper futures and options by Sept. 20, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s only
the third week this year the net position has been a bet on
declining prices.  Buyers meeting for LME week may be more cautious in their
orders this year, said Steve Hardcastle, head of client services
for industrial commodities at Sucden Financial Ltd. The company
is one of the biggest shareholders in the LME, which on Sept. 23
said it had received several “expressions of interest” that
may lead to a takeover.  Manufacturing Output  Manufacturing in China shrank for a third month in
September, according to an index of purchasing managers from
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today. Euro-area services
and manufacturing output contracted for the first time in more
than two years in September, Markit Economics said Sept. 22.  U.S. housing starts dropped 5 percent to a three-month low
in August, the Commerce Department said Sept. 20. Construction
accounts for 25 percent of copper demand, the Copper Development
Association estimates.  “It is remarkable how long copper had stayed at elevated
levels, but now everyone is just giving up on everything at the
slightest smell of risk,” said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, the head
of rates, foreign exchange and commodities strategy at Danske
Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “Even with lower growth in 2012, the
picture still looks promising for some commodities, but we have
to go through this phase of very high volatility.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
