Australia’s budget deficit was
narrower than forecast in the year through June as a reduction
in spending more than offset lower-than-estimated  tax revenue ,
Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said.  The shortfall was A$47.7 billion ($46.6 billion) in fiscal
2010-11, compared with the A$49.4 billion forecast in the May
budget, Swan said in a statement today in Canberra. The smaller
deficit reflected lower cash payments of A$3.6 billion, which
exceeded a A$2 billion shortfall in cash receipts, he said.  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  has pledged to return the
nation’s budget to surplus in 2013, an election year. The goal
will be harder to achieve as Australia’s economy, the only one
in the developed world to avoid a recession during the 2009
global downturn, is buffeted by global financial market strains
and weaker growth in major trading partners.  “Despite the major impact on budget revenues from the
global financial crisis, recent natural disasters and a strong
Australian dollar,  Australia ’s finances remain amongst the
strongest in the developed world,” Swan said. “The government
remains determined to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13,
despite softer-than-expected revenues and increased global
instability that will inevitably make the task more difficult.”  Global Instability  Elevated U.S. unemployment, Europe’s failure to contain a
debt crisis and slowing Chinese demand for commodities may
contribute to a less robust rebound in Australia’s economy next
year. The  International Monetary Fund  last month lowered its
forecast for the nation’s increase in gross domestic product in
2012 to 3.3 percent, from 3.5 percent in early August.  The Australian dollar was little changed, trading at 97.62
U.S. cents as of 9:14 a.m. in Sydney, from 97.75 cents before
the final budget statement and 97.82 cents yesterday in  New
York .  Australian government net debt was A$84.6 billion, or 6.1
percent of GDP, in 2010-11, today’s statement showed.  “This is dramatically lower than the level across major
advanced economies, which averaged a net debt of 75.3 percent of
GDP in 2010,” said Swan, who was named finance minister of the
year by Euromoney magazine this month.  Myer Holdings Ltd. (MYR) , Australia’s biggest department-store
chain, sees consumer confidence at a three-decade low and
doesn’t expect any improvement in at least six months, Chief
Executive Officer Bernie Brookes said in an interview this week.  Australia’s economy contracted 0.9 percent in the first
quarter this year from the prior quarter, according to
government figures. GDP rose 1.2 percent in the second quarter,
the most in four years, as the economy began rebounded from
Queensland flooding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
