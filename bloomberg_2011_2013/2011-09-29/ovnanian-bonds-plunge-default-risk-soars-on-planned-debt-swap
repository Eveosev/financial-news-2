Bonds from  Hovnanian Enterprises
Inc. (HOV)  tumbled and the cost to protect the debt from default
soared after the largest homebuilder in  New Jersey  announced
exchange offers for up to $220 million of securities.   The company’s $797 million of 10.625 percent senior secured
notes due in October 2016 tumbled 5.3 cents to 79.4 cents on the
dollar as of 11:33 a.m. in  New York , the lowest since at least
March 2010, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.   Credit-default swaps protecting against default for five
years increased 1.8 percentage points to 59.5 percent upfront as
of 3 p.m. in New York, according to data provider CMA. That’s in
addition to 5 percent a year, meaning it would cost $5.95
million initially and $500,000 annually to protect $10 million
of Hovnanian’s debt, and implies an 87.7 percent chance of
default within five years, the data show.  The  Red Bank , New Jersey-based homebuilder is offering to
exchange senior notes with coupons ranging from 6.25 percent to
11.875 percent and maturities from 2014 through 2017 for up to
$220 million of new 2 percent senior secured bonds due 2021,
according to a statement distributed by Globe Newswire
yesterday. Hovnanian said the offer will expire on Oct. 26 and
that the early tender and consent time is at 5 p.m. in New York
on Oct. 12.   To contact the reporter on this story:
