U.S. stocks rose, rebounding from
an earlier loss, as lower-than-estimated claims for  unemployment
benefits  and a vote by German lawmakers to expand a European
bailout fund helped offset losses by technology and consumer
companies. Greek bonds surged and the euro rose.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.8 percent to
1,160.40 at 4 p.m. New York time, recovering from a 1 percent
decline earlier. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 0.4 percent
as Apple Inc. declined 1.6 percent, falling for a fourth
straight day. The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index advanced 0.7 percent as
banks rallied. The Greek two-year yield tumbled 453 basis points
to 65.24 percent. Natural gas slid 1.4 percent as the U.S.
reported a rise in supplies, while oil climbed.  “We got two excellent numbers,”  Philip Orlando , the New
York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors
Inc., which oversees about $350 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “It suggests that we are coming out of the soft
patch and not spiraling into a double-dip recession,” he said.
“Equities have to go up on this, but the challenge is that
domestic economic fundamentals don’t matter as much as what’s
happening in the euro zone right now.”  The  S&P 500  rallied as much as 2.2 percent early in the
trading day, after the  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.3 percent pace
in the second quarter, faster than previously estimated, and
applications for jobless benefits dropped by a more-than-
forecast 37,000 to 391,000, the fewest since April, according to
government data. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  gained support
from lawmakers to expand the European Financial Stability
Facility’s firepower.  Consumer, Technology Stocks  Two industries that have beaten the S&P 500 in the third
quarter, computer and software makers and companies dependent on
discretionary  consumer spending , fell the most today. The S&P
500 Information Technology Index lost 0.4 percent, bringing its
two-day loss to 1.8 percent. Among its constituents, Apple,
which climbed 16 percent in the quarter, has dropped 5.5 percent
since Sept. 20, while Google Inc., up 4.2 percent for the
quarter, slid 2.2 percent in the last two days.  Among consumer stocks,  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  declined 6.9 percent,
Wynn Resorts Ltd. fell 7.3 percent, and  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) 
tumbled 11 percent. Netflix, the movie rental service that has
rallied 194 percent since March 9, 2009, plunged 57 percent in
the third quarter, the second-biggest retreat behind Alpha
Natural Resources Inc., which decreased 59 percent.  ‘Bastions of Outperformance’  “They’re shooting the last bastions of outperformance,
because consumer stocks have actually done really well,” said
 Dan Veru , who oversees $3.3 billion as chief investment officer
at Fort Lee, New Jersey-based Palisade Capital Management LLC.
“They’re selling the winners that have exposure outside of the
U.S."  Concern about slower economic growth in  China  weighed on
American retailers with significant business in  Asia , including
Tiffany and  Coach Inc. (COH) , which lost 6.1 percent. Most global
investors predict Chinese growth will slow to less than half the
pace sustained since the government began dismantling Mao
Zedong’s communist economy three decades ago, a Bloomberg poll
indicated.  Fifty-nine percent of respondents said China’s gross
domestic product, which rose 9.5 percent last quarter, will gain
less than 5 percent annually by 2016. Twelve percent see such a
slowdown within a year, and 47 percent said it will occur in two
to five years, the quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll of investors,
analysts and traders who are Bloomberg subscribers showed.  Quarterly Losses  Concern  Greece  will default is dragging global equities and
commodities toward their biggest quarterly losses since 2008,
during the worst recession since the 1930s. The MSCI All-Country
World Index has lost about 16 percent since the end of June and
the S&P GSCI Index of commodities has fallen about 9.3 percent.
About three-quarters of investors surveyed by Bloomberg say the
euro-area economy will fall into recession in the next year and
more than half predict China’s growth will slow to less than 5
percent a year by 2016.  Investors are seeking safer assets even as the U.S.  Federal
Reserve  last month pledged to keep rates near zero through
mid-2013. Treasuries returned 5.87 percent this quarter as of
Sept. 28, on pace for the biggest advance since the three-month
period that ended in December 2008, according to Bank of America
Corp. data.  U.S. government debt  has gained 8.2 percent in 2011,
poised for the best yearly performance since 2008.  Bank Stocks  Financial stocks in the S&P 500 rallied 2.8 percent, the
most among 10 industries. The KBW Bank Index jumped 3.3 percent.
Bank of America Corp. climbed 3.1 percent, while JPMorgan Chase
& Co. added 3 percent.  About two shares advanced for each that declined in the
Stoxx 600.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and Commerzbank AG helped lead banks
higher, climbing more than 4.6 percent. Hennes & Mauritz AB
advanced 6.8 percent as Europe’s second-largest clothing
retailer reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  The euro appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.3597. The 17-nation
European currency rose 0.7 percent against the yen, while the
Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against those of
six trading partners, gained less than 0.1 percent.  The yield on the Greek 10-year bond fell for the third day,
declining 37 basis points to 22.67 percent. That drove the
difference in yield with benchmark German bunds down by 37 basis
points to 2,066 basis points. The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond
slipped seven basis points to 5.58 percent after the government
sold 7.9 billion euros ($10.8 billion) of debt. The Portuguese
10-year yield dropped 42 basis points to 11.16 percent, falling
for a second day.  German Vote  Germany’s lower house of parliament approved the expansion
of the European Financial Stability Facility with 523 votes in
favor and 85 against, freeing the way for European officials to
focus on what next steps may be needed to stem the debt crisis.  ‘‘Crucially, Merkel won the vote without relying on the
opposition,”  Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at UBS AG in
 London , wrote in a note to clients. “Fears had initially been
voiced that dissent within the party would be high.”  Treasury 30-year bonds advanced for the first time in five
days, sending the yield down two basis points, as the Federal
Reserve prepared to announce its schedule of purchases of
longer-maturing debt under its economic stimulus plan known as
Operation Twist.  Oil,  Natural Gas   The S&P GSCI index of 24 raw materials climbed 0.5, led by
agriculture prices. Crude oil climbed as much as 3.4 percent
before paring its gain to 1.1 percent. Natural gas futures
declined 1.4 percent after a U.S. government report showed the
biggest weekly inventory gain in more than two years. The Energy
Department said gas stockpiles rose 111 billion cubic feet in
the week ended Sept. 23 to 3.312 trillion cubic feet. Analyst
estimates showed an expected gain of 103 billion.  The MSCI Emerging Market Index rose 0.4 percent. The index
has dropped 22 percent for the quarter, the worst performance
since 2008. Turkey’s ISE National 100 Index rose 1.3 percent,
led by banks, on speculation the country’s debt may be upgraded.
South Korea’s Kospi Index jumped 2.7 percent and benchmarks in
Russia and Hungary climbed at least 1.2 percent.  The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.1 percent to a 14-
month low on concern growth will slow, and the cost of insuring
Chinese government debt rose 9.5 basis points to 182.4, the
highest since March 2009, according to CMA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
