The  European Central Bank  said
financial institutions increased overnight deposits to the most
in more than two weeks.  Banks parked 173.2 billion euros ($235.8 billion) with the
ECB yesterday, up from 164.1 billion euros a day earlier and the
most since Sept. 12, according to data published by the
Frankfurt-based central bank today. Overnight borrowing at the
marginal rate of 2.25 percent fell to 426 million euros from 726
million euros, the ECB said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
