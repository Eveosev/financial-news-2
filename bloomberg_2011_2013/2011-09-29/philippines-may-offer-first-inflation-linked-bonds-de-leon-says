The  Philippines  may sell its first
inflation-linked bonds in 2012 to increase funding options amid
increased volatility in global markets, Finance Undersecretary
Rosalia de Leon said today in  Manila .  The nation may scrap a plan to issue yen-denominated notes
this year, de Leon said, as  Europe ’s debt crisis and a U.S.
slowdown sap demand for emerging-market assets. The government
may borrow $500 million from the local market, an amount
previously planned to be raised overseas, and will consider
selling Samurai bonds in 2012, she said.  “We are looking at structured products for next year
including inflation-linked bonds,” de Leon said. “We need to
study this because there are issues like tax treatment.”  Inflation-linked securities typically have lower coupons
than conventional debt because the principal increases annually
at the rate of gains in the consumer-price index. Inflation in
the $200 billion economy cooled to 4.7 percent in August, the
slowest pace in four months, government data show.  The government had planned the first exchange of dollar
bonds into local-currency debt this year and had approval from
the central bank to offer as much as $3 billion in peso and
dollar notes to global investors before the U.S. lost its AAA
credit rating from  Standard & Poor’s  on Aug. 5. Finance
Secretary Cesar Purisima said Aug. 11 that international markets
are too volatile for a debt sale or a bond swap.  The Philippines plans to cut next year’s borrowing in
domestic and overseas markets as it narrows the  budget deficit ,
according to documents submitted to the Congress on July 26.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
