The European Union urged ethnic
minorities in  Serbia  not to boycott an upcoming population
census in the country considered essential for defining future
policies.  The census starting Oct. 1, with preliminary results
expected Nov. 15, will provide “key statistical indicators
which will help in articulating effective economic, social and
regional policies,” the EU office in Belgrade said in an e-
mailed statement.  Leaders of some of Serbia’s ethnic Albanian and other
Muslim communities said they would ignore the census to protest
allegedly inadequate questionnaires and weak government support
to their underdeveloped areas in Serbia’s south.  “We are eager to see all minority groups, especially in
the areas with serious economic and social problems, to engage”
in the census, said Vincent Degert, EU ambassador to Belgrade,
as he signed an agreement providing 19.5 million euros ($26.6
million) support to Serbia’s  Statistics Office.   Serbia’s last census, in 2002, showed the country’s
population at almost 7.5 million, including a 62,000-strong
ethnic Albanian community and more than 150,000 Muslims or
ethnic Bosnians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
