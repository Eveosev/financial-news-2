The Dutch government rejects a plan
of the European Union to impose a financial-transaction tax that
would take effect in 2014.  The plan is “no good at all” and would affect
competitiveness of the European Union, Frans Weekers, Deputy
Finance Minister, said at a meeting with lawmakers in parliament
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
