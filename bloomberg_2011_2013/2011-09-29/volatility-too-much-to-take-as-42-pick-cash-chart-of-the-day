Losses that have erased about $8.7
trillion from global equities this quarter are sending more
investors into cash than any time in a year.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the percentage of Bloomberg
users in a poll who plan to raise holdings of cash, stocks,
commodities and corporate bonds over the next six months. A
record 42 percent of respondents said they are raising funds, up
from 26 percent a year ago, while those boosting equities fell
to 39 percent from 44 percent. The quarterly Bloomberg Global
Poll of investors, analysts and traders began in July 2010.  “Investors are determined to protect their cash,” Lionel Mellul, a poll respondent and co-founder of New York-based
Momentum Trading Partners, wrote in an e-mail. “I am totally
aligned with this approach and would rather favor the safety
first of the capital.”  Stocks worldwide are headed for their worst quarterly
performance since the end of 2008 on concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis will trigger a global recession. The MSCI All-Country
World Index has lost 17 percent this quarter and trades at 11.8
times reported earnings, near the lowest level since March 2009.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index closed at 48
on Aug. 8, the highest reading since March 9, 2009.  “My opinion on why this is happening is uncertainty,
uncertainty, uncertainty,” Jay Wright, an Austin, Texas-based
managing director at Samco Capital Markets Inc., wrote in an e-
mail. “Most people are not concerned with the return on
principal at this point. They are concerned about the return of
principal.”  Investors are seeking safer assets even as the U.S. Federal
Reserve last month pledged to keep rates near zero through
mid-2013. Treasuries returned 5.8 percent this quarter as of
Sept. 27, on pace for the biggest advance since the three-month
period that ended in December 2008, according to Bank of America
Corp. data.  U.S. government debt  has gained 8.2 percent in 2011,
poised for the best yearly performance since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
