President  Dennis Lockhart  said high U.S. unemployment may stem
more from a slowdown in hiring than from an effort by employers
to reduce payrolls.  “Persistent unemployment may be more attributable to a
slowdown in the hiring rate than a rise in job destruction and
job loss,” Lockhart said today in Atlanta, citing a research
paper. “A hiring slowdown can be viewed as consistent with a
structural problem, a mismatch problem.”  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the U.S. is facing
a crisis with a jobless rate at or above 9 percent since April
2009. Fed officials are trying to determine how much
unemployment results from long-term labor market challenges such
as global competition or a difference between workers’ skills
and employers’ needs.  The issue of high unemployment is “perplexing and
vexing,” Lockhart said, adding that employment may not be
entirely responsive to monetary policy.  “What are the limitations of policy, particularly monetary
policy in dealing with the Fed’s employment mandate and actually
contributing to a solution to this unemployment problem?” he
said a conference on employment and education at the Atlanta
Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
