Total SA (FP) , Europe’s biggest refiner,
shut down a unit at a fertilizer plant in Normandy following an
explosion and fire.  A blaze that broke out in the machine room of the GPN
factory in Grand-Quevilly was brought under control by
firefighters, according to a statement from the Paris-based
French  oil company . No one was injured and no “abnormal
concentrations” of toxic gases were measured in the area, the
statement said.  Total last year pledged to improve safety at French plants
following fatal accidents in 2009. Five people died in accidents
at the company’s sites in that year, including two in an
explosion at a steam cracker at the Carling petrochemicals
complex. Three people died in separate incidents at the Flanders
and Provence refineries and the Grand Quevilly plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
