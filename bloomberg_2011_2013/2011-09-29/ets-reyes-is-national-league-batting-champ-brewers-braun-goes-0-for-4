Jose Reyes  became the first batting
title champion in the  New York Mets ’ 50-year history when he
edged Milwaukee’s Ryan Braun on the final day of the regular
season.  Reyes extended his lead in the chase for the National
League batting crown earlier today with a first-inning bunt
single, raising his average to .337. He then asked to be taken
out of the game.  Braun came into the evening with a .335 average, and ended
it with a .332 mark after going 0-for-4 in a 7-3 win against the
Pittsburgh Pirates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
