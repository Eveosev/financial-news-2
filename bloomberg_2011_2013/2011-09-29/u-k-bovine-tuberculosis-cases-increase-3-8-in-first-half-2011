U.K. bovine tuberculosis cases rose
3.8 percent in the first half of the year compared with the same
period a year earlier, the National Farmers Union said in a
report, citing Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
figures. Between January and June, 18,082 cattle were
slaughtered after testing positive for tuberculosis, according
to the report. About 5,661 herds were under movement
restrictions because of the disease, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
