Samsung Electronics Co. will keep
delaying sales of its Galaxy 10.1 tablet computer in  Australia 
until a judge rules on Apple Inc.’s request for a longer
injunction, as the two companies wage a global patent battle.  Samsung is willing to extend a previous agreement to hold
off selling the Galaxy 10.1 that was due to expire Sept. 30,
lawyer David Catterns said in Sydney court. Federal Court
Justice Annabelle Bennett said she expects to issue a ruling on
Apple’s request “sometime next week.”  Apple lawyer Steven Burley said Samsung has an interest in
delaying trial on the patent dispute, which began in April in
the U.S. after Apple sued Samsung claiming Galaxy products
imitated the designs and technologies used in iPads and iPhones.
Samsung struck back with lawsuits in  South Korea ,  Japan ,
 Germany , the Netherlands and Australia.  “By the time Samsung gets to trial, they’ll be onto their
next product” so any ban on the sale of the Galaxy 10.1 would
no longer have any effect, Burley said.  Samsung agreed in August to delay its planned release of
the Galaxy 10.1 tablets in Australia until Bennett rules on
Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple’s request for the injunction,
which would bar the sale of the product until a court rules on
its patent infringement claim following a trial.  Bennett urged both sides to consider starting trial as soon
as possible. “Technology moves very quickly,” Bennett said in
a Sept. 26 hearing.  The case is:  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  v. Samsung Electronics Co.
NSD1243/2011. Federal Court of Australia (Sydney).  To contact the reporter on this story:
