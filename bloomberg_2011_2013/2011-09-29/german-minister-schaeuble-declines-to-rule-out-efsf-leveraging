German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  declined to rule out using financial leveraging to
increase the capacity of the European rescue fund.  “What the future brings no one can say,” Schaeuble said
on German radio today, when asked about leveraging the fund. Any
expansion would have to be approved by the Bundestag, and
without its backing “nothing at all” will happen, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
