Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , Canada’s
third-largest insurer, agreed to buy the 32 percent of McLean
Budden it doesn’t already own for about C$144 million ($139.6
million).  Sun Life will transfer the money-management business to its
MFS Investment Management unit, the Toronto-based insurer said
today in a statement.  The transaction boosts Sun Life’s assets under management
by about 14 percent to C$261 billion for the two companies.
McLean Budden manages about C$32 billion. Boston-based MFS,
owner of the oldest U.S. mutual fund, will also be able to use
McLean Budden’s research and distribution, according to the
statement.  “For MFS, it gives them the opportunity to become a major
player in the Canadian market overnight and access to all the
different channels McLean has,” Sun Life  Canada  President Kevin Dougherty said today in a telephone interview. “Really, you’ve
got this marriage of investment capability, research and
distribution that comes out of this deal.”  McLean Budden Chief Executive Officer Roger Beauchemin will
continue in his role until the transaction is completed, which
is expected to be in November, according to the statement. The
company expects to retain most of McLean Budden’s 100 employees,
Dougherty said.  The transaction isn’t likely to have any “material
impact” on Sun Life results, said  John Aiken , an analyst at
 Barclays Capital  in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
