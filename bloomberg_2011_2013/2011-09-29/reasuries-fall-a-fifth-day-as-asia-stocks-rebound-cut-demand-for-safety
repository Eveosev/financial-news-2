Treasuries fell for a fifth day,
the longest losing streak since July, as gains in Asia shares
and U.S. stock futures reduced demand for the relative safety of
government debt.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $29 billion of seven-year
securities today, the last of three note auctions this week
totaling $99 billion. Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Officer
 Alan Mulally  said he doesn’t expect a double-dip U.S. recession.  “I’m bearish” on U.S. debt, said Yoshiyuki Suzuki who
helps oversee the equivalent of $71.9 billion as the Tokyo-based
head of fixed income at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Co.
“People will shift money out of Treasuries” in search of
higher yields elsewhere, he said.  Ten-year rates rose two basis points to 2 percent as of
7:34 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The 2.125 percent security maturing in August 2021 fell 1/8, or
$1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 5/32. 4. The yield slid to
1.6714 percent on Sept. 23, the least ever based on  Federal
Reserve  data.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares rose 0.3 percent,
recouping an earlier 1.3 percent loss.  Standard & Poor’s  500
Index futures increased 0.7 percent. Mulally said today in
Bangkok that Ford plans to add 7,000 jobs over the next two
years in the U.S. as it expects the world’s largest economy to
avoid another recession.  Treasuries headed for the biggest quarterly gain since 2008
before an industry report on U.S. home sales that economists
said will be the latest evidence that America’s economy is
struggling.  Twist Begins  The Federal Reserve is scheduled to begin a program next
month to replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries, a plan that has been
dubbed Operation Twist by economists.  Treasuries have returned 5.9 percent this quarter, and they
are up 8.3 percent this year, based on Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data. Bonds rallied even after Standard & Poor’s cut the
 U.S. debt  rating by one level to AA+ on Aug. 5.  The gains are the biggest since an 8.9 percent surge in the
last three months of 2008, boosting returns to almost 14 percent
that year, as investors sought a haven during the last
recession.  MSCI All Country World Index of stocks has handed investors
a 12 percent loss in 2011 after accounting for reinvested
dividends.  The Fed announcement on Sept. 21 that it plans to buy long-
term Treasuries helped narrow the difference between two- and
30-year yields to 2.83 percentage points from this year’s high
of 4.04 percentage points in January.  Housing Data  “Operation Twist will stop yields from rising,” said
Kazuaki Oh’e, a debt salesman in  Tokyo  at CIBC World Markets
Japan Inc., a unit of  Canada ’s fifth-largest lender. “The
economy isn’t expanding. There’s no other place to park money.”  U.S. pending home sales, or contract signings for existing
dwellings, decreased 2 percent in August, after falling 1.3
percent the prior month, the National Association of Realtors
will report today, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists.  At yesterday’s auction, the five-year notes drew a yield of
1.015 percent, compared with the previous record of 1.029
percent on Aug. 24. A $35 billion sale of two-year notes on
Sept. 27 drew the highest demand in a year.  The U.S. seven-year notes being sold today yielded 1.50
percent in pre-auction trading, versus 1.58 percent at the
previous sale of the securities on Aug. 25, a record low.  Investors bid for 2.76 times the amount offered last month,
compared with an average of 2.79 for the past 10 auctions.
Indirect bidders, the investor class that includes central banks
outside the U.S., purchased 51.7 percent of the securities, the
most at the monthly sales since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
