New World Development Co., the Hong
Kong developer controlled by billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , posted a
23 percent decline in full-year underlying profit after booking
lower earnings from home sales and commercial rents in the city.  Profit excluding property revaluations fell to HK$4.67
billion ($599 million) for the 12 months ended June 30 from
HK$6.08 billion a year earlier, New World said in a statement
today. That missed the HK$5.08 billion average estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose to HK$32.9 billion
from HK$30.2 billion.  Growth in Hong Kong home prices has slowed since the second
quarter on rising mortgage rates and as the government stepped
up measures to curb real estate values that have surged more
than 70 percent since early 2009. New World’s rental revenue was
also hurt by the closure of its New World Centre in the Tsim Sha
Tsui district for redevelopment.  Profit from property sales fell to HK$3.5 billion from
HK$6.06 billion a year earlier, as the group sold units at
projects including Emerald Green and Belcher’s Hill, it said.  New World said gross rental income in  Hong Kong  declined 5
percent to HK$1.14 billion  The stock has fallen 49 percent this year, compared with
the 22 percent declined in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index . The
shares fell 1.8 percent to HK$7.45 in Hong Kong yesterday. The
Hong Kong stock market was closed today as Typhoon Nesat swept
gale-force winds and rain into the city.  The builder also invests in roads, power generation,
transportation, telecommunications and retailing. Chairman Cheng
is Hong Kong’s fourth-richest person, according to Forbes
Magazine rankings, with an estimated wealth of $9 billion.  The company will pay a final dividend of 28 Hong Kong cents
a share, unchanged from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
