The euro’s rebound against the
dollar will likely continue for just about a week before the
currency forms a top and heads lower, according to Bank of
America Corp., citing technical indicators.  The 17-nation euro approached a one-week high versus the
dollar today as  Germany ’s lower house of parliament approved the
expansion of a bailout fund for debt-stricken euro-area nations
to help contain the sovereign-debt crisis. The euro gained as
much as 1 percent to $1.3679 after rising to $1.3690 yesterday,
the strongest since Sept. 21.  A “sustained break” of the $1.3586 to $1.3596 would
likely be followed by a move to resistance in the $1.3863 to
$1.3902 band, and potentially as high as $1.4, before the
momentum wanes,  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign exchange and
interest rates technical strategy at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, wrote in a note to clients today. Resistance is an area
where sell orders may be clustered, making additional gains
difficult.  “On a near-term basis the euro could rally further, but it
should be fairly short-lived, maybe about another week or so,
Curry said in a telephone interview. “However, strength should
be seen as a selling opportunity.”  Curry said he targets the currency to slide to the $1.3050
to $1.2850 area within a month or so.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
