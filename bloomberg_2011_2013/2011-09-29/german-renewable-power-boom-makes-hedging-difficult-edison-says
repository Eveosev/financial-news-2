Germany ’s renewable energy boom
will make hedging the power output for utilities’ coal and
natural-gas plants “more and more difficult,” according to an
executive at Edison Trading SpA.  The country’s renewable energy output may rise to 200
terawatt-hours in 2020 from 120 terawatt-hours last year, Andrea
Siri, Edison’s head of continental power and origination, said
today at the European Energy Trading Summit in London, citing a
forecast from the network regulator.  “This means there is less space for thermal power plants
and this is a problem,” Siri said.  Utilities including EON AG and RWE AG, Germany’s two
biggest, sell power several years in advance to lock in prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
