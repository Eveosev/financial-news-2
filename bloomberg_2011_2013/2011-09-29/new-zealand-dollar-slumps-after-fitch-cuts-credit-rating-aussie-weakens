New Zealand ’s currency fell to its
lowest level in six months against the dollar after  Standard &
Poor’s  joined  Fitch Ratings  in cutting the country’s credit
rating, adding to concern borrowing costs will increase.  The kiwi weakened versus most of its 16 major peers this
week as a survey showed business confidence fell in September.
The Australian dollar slid against the greenback for a fourth
straight week after a private report indicated a contraction of
Chinese manufacturing. The Aussie reached a three-week high
against its New Zealand counterpart.  “The global outlook is far from looking positive,” said
 Imre Speizer , a strategist in Auckland at Westpac Banking Corp.,
 Australia ’s second-largest lender. “While that remains the
backdrop, commodity currencies like the Aussie and the kiwi will
probably underperform.”  New Zealand’s currency fell to as low as 76.08 U.S. cents,
its weakest level since April 1, before trading at 76.74 U.S.
cents as of 11:28 a.m. in  New York  from 77.10 cents yesterday.
It dropped to 59.15 yen from 59.24 yen. The Australian dollar
fetched 97.44 U.S. cents from 97.82 cents and bought 75.14 yen
from 75.16 yen. The Aussie climbed as high as NZ$1.2777, its
strongest level since Sept. 8, before trading at NZ$1.2706 from
NZ$1.2687 yesterday.  The kiwi dropped 1.3 percent drop against the dollar this
week. It’s down 10.1 percent this month and down 7.5 percent
during the quarter. The Australian dollar has lost 8.8 percent
since Aug. 31 and has declined 9.1 percent during the past three
months.  Rating Cuts  New Zealand’s sovereign credit rating was cut one step to
AA by Fitch, which cited the southern Pacific nation’s high
level of external debt and its persistent current account
deficit. The outlook is stable after the rating was reduced from
AA+, Fitch said yesterday in a statement.  The country had its long-term local-currency rating cut to
AA+ from AAA and its long-term foreign-currency rating reduced
to AA from AA+ by S&P, which has a stable outlook on the
rankings.  The Australian dollar weakened against its Japanese
counterpart after a purchasing managers’ index for  China  showed
the longest contraction in two years.  The reading of 49.9 was unchanged from August and compared
with a preliminary 49.4 figure published last week, according to
the gauge released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. It was the third month the reading was below the 50
level that separates expansion from contraction. China is
Australia’s largest trading partner and New Zealand’s second-
biggest export market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
