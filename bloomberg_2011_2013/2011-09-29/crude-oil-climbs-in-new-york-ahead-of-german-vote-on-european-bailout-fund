Oil climbed in  New York , paring its
biggest quarterly drop since 2008, as investors speculated that
German lawmakers will approve a measure to expand a euro-area
bailout fund, supporting economic growth and fuel demand.  West Texas Intermediate advanced as much as 0.7 percent
after dropping 1.9 percent earlier. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  is seeking support among her coalition lawmakers for the
vote today to expand the European Financial Stability Facility.
Oil in New York pared its earlier decline after falling to
technical support levels.  “We’re trading from headline to headline and that’s all
markets, not just the oil market,”  Michael McCarthy , a chief
market strategist at CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty Ltd. in
Sydney, said by telephone today.  Crude for November delivery gained as much as 54 cents to
$81.75 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $81.63 at 5:10 p.m. Sydney time. The
contract yesterday slid 3.8 percent to $81.21. Futures are down
8 percent this month and 11 percent this year. Prices have
dropped 14 percent since the end of June, the biggest quarterly
loss since the last three months of 2008.  Brent oil for November settlement was at $104.33 a barrel,
up 52 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The European benchmark contract was at a premium of $22.70 to
New York crude, compared with a record of $26.87 on Sept. 6.  Oil rebounded in New York after falling as low as $79.64.
Futures have technical support along the lower Bollinger Band at
about $79.21 a barrel today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Buy orders tend to be clustered near chart-support
levels. Five-day stochastic oscillators have fallen below 30,
signaling prices have dropped too quickly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
