Asian stocks rose, with the
regional benchmark index heading for its biggest three-day gain
since December 2009, as German lawmakers will vote to expand a
bailout fund for Europe’s debt-stricken nations.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,  Japan ’s largest
lender, gained 2.3 percent in  Tokyo  on optimism the German vote
will ease concerns about the global financial system.  Canon
Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, gained 1.6 percent after
orders for U.S. capital goods unexpectedly climbed.  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company, fell 1.4 percent in
Sydney after copper futures extended declines.  “Investors appear to be pinning their hopes on the German
vote on the euro-area rescue fund,” said Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-
based  fund manager  at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co.,
which oversees about $28 billion. “They seem to be betting that
the region’s debt troubles, though there will be sporadic bumps,
will eventually be resolved.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.4 percent to 114.24 as
of 4:26 p.m. Mumbai time, after having lost as much as 1.3
percent. More than two stocks advanced for each that fell.  The gauge is headed for an 8.4 percent decline this month,
extending a slump this quarter to 15 percent, the steepest drop
since the three months ended December 2008. Stocks have plunged
amid concern the global economy is poised for another recession
as Europe’s debt crisis worsens and U.S. economic growth slows.  Nikkei, Kospi  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average added 1 percent,
rebounding from losses of as much as 1.3 percent.  South Korea ’s
Kospi Index climbed 2.7 percent, wiping out losses of as much as
0.9 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.8 percent. Markets in
 Hong Kong  were shut due to a typhoon.  China ’s Shanghai Composite
Index decreased 1.1 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6
percent, erasing losses of as much as 0.7 percent earlier. In
 New York , the index dropped 2.1 percent yesterday after an
official said the European Commission is resisting a push to
impose bigger writedowns on banks’ holdings of Greek government
debt than those agreed at a July 21 summit.  Global investors anticipate  Europe ’s debt crisis leading to
an economic slump, a financial meltdown and social unrest in the
next year, with 72 percent predicting a country abandoning the
euro as a shared currency within five years, a Bloomberg survey
found.  Short-selling Bans  Italian and Spanish financial market regulators extended
temporary bans on short selling of financial shares that were
introduced last month in a bid to stem market volatility, the
European Securities and Markets Authority said. German lawmakers
backed an enhanced euro-area rescue fund after Asian markets
closed today as European officials turn to look at what next
steps may be needed to stem the debt crisis.  “The German parliament will pass the measure, which is
supporting financial equities,” Kazuyuki Terao, chief
investment officer of RCM Japan Ltd., said before the vote.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial increased 2.3 percent to 355 yen.
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest
lender, gained 2.3 percent to 2,219 yen.  Exporters advanced after orders for U.S. capital goods
climbed in August by the most in three months, a sign business
investment continues to support the recovery. The median
projection of 77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a
0.2 percent decline in total orders.  Canon gained 1.6 percent to 3,560 yen. Nintendo Co., the
maker of Wii game consoles that gets about 39 percent of sales
in the “Americas,” jumped 3.1 percent to 11,330 yen in Tokyo.
Honda Motor Co., the Japanese carmaker that depends on  North
America  for 44 percent of sales, rose 1 percent to 2,332 yen.  ‘Excessively Undervalued’  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s third-largest maker of
mobile phones by sales, surged 11 percent to 68,800 won, the
biggest advance on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. A 25 percent
slump this quarter through yesterday made the stock
“excessively undervalued,” Park Won Jae, an analyst at Daewoo
Securities Co. in Seoul, wrote in a report today.  “Opportunities are also rising for LG as mobile-phone
carriers introduce more-advanced services, in which the company
has made a lot of investments,” Park said.  Raw-material producers dropped after commodities extended a
decline on concern Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will hurt
global growth and reduce demand for industrial raw materials. A
gauge of metals in  London  dropped 3.2 percent yesterday. Copper
for three-month delivery fell as much as 5.9 percent today.  BHP fell 1.4 percent to A$35.04 in Sydney. Rio Tinto Group,
the second-biggest mining company by sales, slipped 2.5 percent

earnings on average, compared with 11.6 times for the S&P 500
and 9.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
