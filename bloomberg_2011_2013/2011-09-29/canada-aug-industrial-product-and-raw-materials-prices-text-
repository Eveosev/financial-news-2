The following is the text of
the industrial product and raw material prices report as
reported by  Statistics Canada .  Between July and August, the Industrial Product Price
Index (IPPI) increased 0.5%, led by motor vehicles and
chemical products. The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI)
fell 3.2%, largely as a result of lower prices for mineral
fuels.  Prices for industrial goods rise  The increase of the IPPI in August was the first in
three months, and was primarily the result of higher
prices for motor vehicles and other transport equipment
(+1.7%) and chemicals and chemical products (+0.7%). Pulp
and paper products (+0.9%) and electrical and
communication products (+0.9%) also contributed to the
advance.  Contributing to the increase in the price of motor
vehicles and other transport equipment were higher prices
for automobiles, trucks and buses (+2.5%) and motor
vehicle parts (+0.9%). The 2.8% decline in the value of
the Canadian dollar against the US dollar in August
contributed significantly to the rise in motor vehicle
prices.  Some Canadian producers who export their products are
paid on the basis of prices set in US dollars.
Consequently, the decline of the Canadian dollar in
relation to the US dollar had the effect of increasing the
corresponding prices in Canadian dollars. Without the
impact of the exchange rate, the IPPI would have fallen
0.2% instead of rising 0.5%.  The rise in the IPPI in August was moderated by a 1.1%
decline in petroleum and coal product prices.  Excluding petroleum and coal products, the IPPI would
have risen 0.7% in August, following a 0.5% decline in
July.  12-month change in the IPPI: August advance similar to
increases observed since March  The IPPI was up 5.2% in August compared with the same
month a year earlier, which was similar to the rate of
change observed in the previous five months. Of the 21
major commodity aggregations, 16 advanced and 5 declined.  Compared with August 2010, the increase in the IPPI was
mainly a result of higher prices for petroleum and coal
products (+29.8%) and primary metal products (+10.7%).
Chemicals and chemical products (+8.7%) also contributed
to the advance.  Year over year, prices for petroleum and coal products
continued the upward trend that began in November 2009.
The increase in August was smaller than July, but similar
to advances reported since April 2011.  The largest contributors to the year-over-year price
increase of primary metal products were precious metals,
in particular silver and platinum (+92.5%), precious metal
basic manufactured shapes (+72.5%) and copper products
(+15.5%).  Chemicals and chemical products (+8.7%) and fruit,
vegetables, feeds and other food products (+7.2%) made
smaller contributions to the year-over-year IPPI increase
in August.  In August, the 6.0% year-over-year gain in the value of
the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar slowed the
advance of the IPPI. Without the impact of the exchange
rate, the IPPI would have risen 6.6% instead of 5.2%.  The year-over-year increase in the IPPI in August was
moderated by lower prices for motor vehicles and other
transport equipment (-2.8%), pulp and paper products 
(-2.2%) and lumber and other wood products (-1.7%).  Excluding petroleum and coal prices, the year-over-year
IPPI would have increased 2.4% in August instead of 5.2%.
This continues the upward trend that began in May 2010.  RMPI: Fourth consecutive monthly decrease  The RMPI declined by 3.2% in August compared with the
previous month. This was larger than declines in June and
July, but was smaller than the decrease reported in May.  Prices for raw materials continue to decrease  The decline of the RMPI resulted mainly from mineral
fuels, which were down 7.0%. Crude  oil prices  fell 7.5% in
August, marking the fourth consecutive monthly decrease.
Uncertainty over global growth affected prices until mid
August, when some stabilization was observed.  Contributing to the decline in the RMPI in August were
lower prices for non-ferrous metals (-2.3%), largely
influenced by copper and nickel concentrates (-5.6%) and
non-ferrous metal scrap (-3.6%). Grains (-1.6%) continued
its decline from July.  Prices for animal and animal products (+3.4%), ferrous
materials (+2.1%), coffee, tea and cocoa (+2.3%) as well
as rubber and allied gums (+1.8%) moderated the decrease
in the RMPI.  Excluding mineral fuels, the RMPI would have increased
0.3% in August.  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the RMPI
was up 13.3% in August, the smallest year-over-year
increase since February 2011. The main contributors to the
advance were higher prices for mineral fuels (+12.2%), non-
ferrous metals (+16.7%), vegetable products (+31.5%) as
well as animal and animal products (+11.7%).  Year over year, excluding mineral fuels, the RMPI would
have risen 14.3% in August compared with 17.3% in July.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
usually subject to revision for a period of six months
(for example, when the July index is released, the index
for the previous January becomes final).  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in  Canada  receive as the goods leave
the plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer
pays. Unlike the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes
indirect taxes and all the costs that occur between the
time a good leaves the plant and the time the final user
takes possession of it, including transportation,
wholesale and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often
indicate their prices in foreign currencies, especially in
US dollars, which are then converted into Canadian
dollars. In particular, this is the case for motor
vehicles, pulp, paper and wood products. Therefore, a rise
or fall in the value of the Canadian dollar against its US
counterpart affects the IPPI. But the conversion into
Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents provide
their prices. Moreover, this is not a measure that takes
into account the full effect of exchange rates, since that
is a more difficult analytical task.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is
based on the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot
rate) established by the  Bank of Canada , and it is
available on CANSIM in table 176-0064 (series v37426).
Monthly and annual variations in the exchange rate, as
described in the text, are calculated according to the
indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for example,
CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the
prices paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw
materials. Many of those prices are set on the world
market. However, as few prices are denominated in foreign
currencies, their conversion into Canadian dollars has
only a minor effect on the calculation of the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
