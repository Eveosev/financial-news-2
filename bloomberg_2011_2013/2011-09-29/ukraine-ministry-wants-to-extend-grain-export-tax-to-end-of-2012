Ukraine’s Economy Ministry wants to
extend the existing grain export tax until the end of 2012,
according to a proposed law on the ministry’s website.  The  draft  stipulates that outbound shipments of wheat,
barley and corn will continue to be taxed.  Ukraine started taxing grain exports for the first time on
July 1. The current legislation stipulates that the tax will be
in force until Jan. 1, 2012 at 9 percent for wheat, 12 percent
for corn and 14 percent for barley.  To contact the reporters on this story:
