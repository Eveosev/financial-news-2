Former European Commission
President  Romano Prodi  said it’s up to governments led by
Germany and France to solve the euro-region’s debt problems, not
the European Central Bank.  “I don’t think that Draghi has such a higher degree of
freedom to what Trichet has now,” Prodi said when asked how the
ECB’s approach to the crisis might change under incoming ECB
President  Mario Draghi , who takes over from President Jean-
Claude Trichet on Nov. 1.  Prodi made his remarks in an interview today with Bloomberg
Television’s Francine Lacqua.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
