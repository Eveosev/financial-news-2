Spot gold and silver prices rose
for the second time in three days on demand for a haven amid
concern that the European debt crisis will choke the worldwide
economy.  International investors expect the economy to relapse into
a recession, with more than one in three forecasting a global
meltdown within the next year, a Bloomberg poll showed. The head
of  Europe ’s markets regulator warned banks to be consistent in
valuations of sovereign debt amid concern that some lenders
failed to record sufficient losses on Greek bonds.  “There is so much nervousness out there about every single
thing we hear from Europe,” Sterling Smith, an analyst at
Country Hedging Inc. in  St. Paul ,  Minnesota , said in a telephone
interview. “Also, gold is attractive as the fear of slowdown is
gathering momentum.”  Gold for immediate delivery rose $2.63, or 0.2 percent, to
$1,611.43 an ounce at 3:12 p.m.  New York  time. Earlier, the
price gained as much as 1.6 percent.  The metal has slumped 16 percent from a record $1,921.15 on
Sept. 6 on investor sales to cover losses during a rout in
global equity markets.  Spot silver rose 49.88 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $30.3675
an ounce.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 80 cents to settle
at $1,617.30 on the Comex in New York. The price rose as much as
1.2 percent and fell 2 percent.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 38.8 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $30.52. The metal has tumbled 39 percent from a
31-year high of $49.845 on April 25.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery fell $5.20, or 0.3 percent, to $1,532.90 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery dropped $11.15,
or 1.8 percent, to $623.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporters for this story:
