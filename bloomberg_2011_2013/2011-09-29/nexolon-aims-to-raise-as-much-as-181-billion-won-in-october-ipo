Nexolon Co.,  South Korea â€™s biggest
maker of silicon ingots and wafers used in solar cells, aims to
raise as much as 181 billion won ($155 million) in an initial
public offering next week.  The solar-cell component producer plans to offer 22.6
million new shares at 6,700 won to 8,000 won apiece between Oct.
5 and Oct. 6, the Seoul-based company said in an  e-mailed 
statement today. The  price range  is less than the 7,600-to-9,000
won band that the company indicated in August.  Nexolon plans to use the proceeds to boost its annual
output capacity by 20 percent to 1.7 gigawatts by the year-end
compared with the end of June, according to the statement. The
company received orders for 3.5 gigawatts of solar components as
of July, Nexolon said.  The shares will start trading on the Korea Exchange Oct. 14,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
