Banks must avoid “crazy risk-
taking” as built-up capital pushes them toward more lending,
said  Raghuram Rajan , former chief economist at the  International
Monetary Fund .  “At some point the amount of capital that the banks are
building up will start burning a hole in their pocket and they
will start moving to lend,” Rajan said today in a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene and Ken
Prewitt. “The key again is manageable, sensible risk, rather
than crazy risk-taking.”  Rajan pointed to the example of  UBS AG (UBSN) , which was hit by a
$2.3 billion trading loss at its investment bank.  “How did this guy get away with $2.3 billion worth of
losses?” said Rajan, 48, now a professor at the University of
Chicago’s Booth School of Business. “That boggles the
imagination, especially after what UBS has been through.”  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and Morgan Stanley leapfrogged UBS
during the credit crisis after record writedowns and a U.S.
probe into whether Switzerland’s biggest bank helped American
clients evade taxes.  “The problem comes, as we saw recently, when you lose
control of the risk-management process as in UBS. There you
worry that despite all the talk, we still haven’t gotten full
control of how traders take risk and manage that process in a
way that you limit the kind of losses that you see with UBS,”
Rajan said.  Rajan said that the “good news” is that banks are “a
little more risk-averse” than they were in 2007 and 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
