Hang Lung Properties Ltd. (101) , the  Hong
Kong  developer that’s building shopping malls in other parts of
 China , and its parent bought two sites in Kunming in
southwestern China for 3.5 billion yuan ($547 million).  Hang Lung, Hong Kong’s third-biggest builder by value, won
the bidding for the land, which has a maximum floor area of
401,383 square meters (4.3 million square feet) and will be used
for “commercial and financial development,” the company said
in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange today. They are the
first sites Hang Lung has bought in the nation since May 2009.  Hang Lung is investing as much as HK$50 billion ($6.4
billion) building shopping malls in cities including Shenyang,
Wuxi, Tianjin and Dalian that are scheduled for completion over
the next four years. Chairman Ronnie Chan said in August the
company is “financially capable” of doubling that investment
to tap the country’s growing luxury spending.  Kunming is the capital and largest city of Yunnan province.  The developer, which had about HK$27 billion in cash at the
end of June, hasn’t bought any land in Hong Kong in at least 10
years. The company in August opened a 3.5 billion yuan shopping
mall in the eastern Chinese city of Jinan, its fourth outside of
Hong Kong.  Hang Lung shares have declined 33 percent this year
compared with a 22 drop in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index . They
lost 2.8 percent yesterday to HK$24.40. Hong Kong’s financial
markets were shut today because of Typhoon Nesat.  To contact the reporters on this story:
