OAO Severstal Chief Executive
Officer Alexey Mordashov said he doesn’t expect the new
government formed after  Russia ’s 2012 presidential election to
raise taxation on steelmakers.  The steel industry is volatile and less profitable than oil
and gas, billionaire Mordashov said today at an investor
conference in London. Russia’s business environment doesn’t
allow for increasing taxation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
