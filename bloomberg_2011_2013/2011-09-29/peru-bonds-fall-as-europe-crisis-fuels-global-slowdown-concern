Peruvian bonds fell, pushing up
yields the most in a week, as concern the euro-area’s sovereign-
debt crisis will derail the global economy cut demand for
higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.90 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 0.4 centimo to 113.21
centimos per sol.  The euro-area economy will fall into recession during the
next 12 months, according to about three-quarters of respondents
in a Bloomberg survey. More than a third of participants say
 Europe ’s debt troubles will choke the world economy. Copper,
Peru’s biggest export, declined amid concern slower growth will
curb demand for industrial metals.  “There isn’t any inflow into Peru’s bonds or currency even
though they’re at attractive levels,” said Gonzalo Navarro, the
head trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima. “The flows are still
going in the other direction. Investors wanting to get out of
emerging market assets are using the correction in stocks and
currency to do so at interesting prices.”  The sol strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 2.7705 per
 U.S. dollar , from 2.7715 yesterday.  The central bank didn’t buy or sell dollars in the  spot
market  today, it said on its website.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell nine basis points to 261,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
