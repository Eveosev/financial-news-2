The European Union will import
19,593 metric tons of sugar at reduced duty under the last of
five planned tenders, according to the European Commission, the
blocâ€™s regulatory arm.  The EU backed a proposal in May to import the sweetener at
a reduced rate and authorized duty-free imports of 200,000 tons
of sugar to ease supplies in the region. The EU also allowed
300,000 tons of imports at zero duty earlier this year, bringing
the total to 500,000 tons.  Raw-sugar imports under the last tender totaled 15,327
tons, with 14,500 tons for refining, the commission said in an
e-mailed statement today. The bloc will bring in 4,266 tons of
white, or refined, sugar under the tender.  The lowest duty to be paid for white sugar was 308.80 euros
($421.39) a ton, while the lowest on raw sugar for refining was
227 euros a ton, according to the statement.  The bloc imported 356,566 tons of sweetener at reduced duty
under the five tenders, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
