European stocks erased an advance,
leaving the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index little changed at
227.22 as of 11:58 a.m. in  London . A rally in banks was offset
by declines at basic-resource companies.  The gauge has swung between losses of as much as 0.7
percent and gains as large as 0.6 percent today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
