U.K. government bond auctions are
showing “strength” in demand as investors seek safety amid the
euro-area debt crisis, according to the nation’s debt chief
Robert Stheeman.  Investors bid for about twice the amount sold when Britain
auctioned 4.5 billion pounds ($7.05 billion) of bonds maturing
in 2052 on Sept. 27. Banks obliged to participate bought all the
5 billion euros ($6.8 billion) of five-year notes  Germany  sold
yesterday as other investors didn’t enter a single bid,
according to six people with the knowledge of the sale.  “The result shows enduring strength of our investor base,
and it’s perhaps also a result of a general flight to safety,”
Stheeman said in an interview in London. “Gilts are viewed as
part of the safe-haven world in the current environment.”  Gilt issuance may drop from the record level of 227.59
billion pounds in the fiscal year ended March 2010, Stheeman
said, citing forecasts from the  Office for Budget
Responsibility , the government’s fiscal watchdog. The U.K. plans
to auction 167.5 billion pounds of gilts in the 12 months
starting April.  The government’s financing requirement, which determines
the issuance of gilts, is projected to fall to 164 billion
pounds next fiscal year, and 133 billion pounds the following
year, according to the Debt Management Office’s website.  “There can always be surprises, and it’s a nature of the
market and the economics that things don’t always turn out the
way you would expect,” Stheeman said. “But the surprise can be
in both directions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
