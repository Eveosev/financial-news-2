OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP) , a Russian coal
producer, said first-half profit fell 57 percent from a year
earlier after a fire at its flagship mine cut capacity.  Net income fell to $99 million from $229 million on revenue
of $377 million, down 19 percent from the same period a year
earlier. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization declined 31 percent to $180 million.  Capacity hasnâ€™t recovered since a series of explosions and
fires at a mine in Siberia last year that killed 90 people,
George Buzhenitsa, a Deutsche Bank AG analyst, said today by
phone. The shares dropped as much as 5.4 percent in Moscow,
extending their decline this year to 55 percent.  Raspadskaya spent 1.2 billion rubles ($38 million) in the
first half, of a total budget of 8.6 billion rubles, rebuilding
the mine and plans to start production from the second face in
the near future, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
