The  Portuguese government  said the
planned sale of its stake in utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA
may not involve a public offering as it has “indications” that
the holding can be sold through a direct sale.  Luis Marques Guedes, the secretary of state for the
presidency of the council of ministers, spoke today at a press
conference following the government’s weekly cabinet meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
