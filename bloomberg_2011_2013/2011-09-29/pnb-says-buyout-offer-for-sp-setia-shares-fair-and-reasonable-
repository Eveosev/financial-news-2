Permodalan Nasional Bhd. said its
buyout offer of 3.90 ringgit a share for  Malaysia ’s  SP Setia
Bhd. (SPSB)  is “fair and reasonable,” according to an e-mailed
statement last night.  The offer translates into a price-earnings multiple of 19.8
times, compared to the Kuala Lumpur Property Index’s PE of 9.8
times, it said. Permodalan, or PNB, is “confident” of SP
Setia’s management and wants the latter to have an “undivided
focus” on maximizing shareholders’ value, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
