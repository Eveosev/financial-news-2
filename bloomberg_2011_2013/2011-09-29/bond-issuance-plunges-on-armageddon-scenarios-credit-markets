Corporate bond offerings worldwide
plunged in the third quarter to the lowest level since Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 failure as Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis caused investors to shun all but the safest securities.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , the world’s largest maker of personal
computers, and Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker  Intel
Corp. (INTC)  led borrowers issuing $545.4 billion of bonds in the past
three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance
fell 41 percent from the second quarter and 38 percent from a
year ago as offerings by financial firms and junk-rated
companies largely evaporated.  Relative borrowing costs jumped to the highest in more than
two years after  Standard & Poor’s  stripped the U.S. of its top
credit grade in August and debt swaps signaled a near-certain
probability of Greece defaulting. The  Federal Reserve  failed to
ignite issuance after saying it would replace $400 billion of
short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries to
stave off recession and lower  interest rates .  “Nobody likes buying debt when everyone’s putting out
stories that Armageddon is around the corner,” Michael Johnson,
chief market strategist at Scottsdale, Arizona-based broker-
dealer M.S. Howells & Co., said by telephone. “The underlying
problems in the corporate market aren’t there, but that’s being
masked until we can figure out what Europe’s going to do.”  ‘Risk-Off Sentiment’  The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
corporate bonds globally instead of government debt grew to 264
basis points on Sept. 26, the widest since July 2009, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Yields for issuers
rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and less than BBB-
by S&P rose to 9.72 percent, the most since December 2009.  “There’s a risk-off sentiment that’s tied to a lack of a
believable solution in  Europe  and a lack of any firm guidance on
the  U.S. economy  from  Washington ,” said Zane Brown, fixed-
income strategist at Lord Abbett & Co. in  Jersey City , New
Jersey. “The cynics in fixed-income are waiting to see proof
before they buy in again.”  Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost to protect U.S. and
European company debentures rose as a measure of stress in debt
markets increased by the most in three weeks. Hovnanian
Enterprises Inc. bonds tumbled after the homebuilder offered to
exchange $220 million of notes. Relative yields on emerging
market debt soared.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, gained 1.3 basis points to a mid-
price of 141.1 basis points as of 12:01 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Markit Group Ltd.  Swap Spreads  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps
linked to 125 companies with investment-grade ratings jumped 8.5
basis points to 199.25, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at
11:30 a.m. in  London .  The indexes, which typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves, gained as two-year
interest-rate swap spreads increased on concern that Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis and a sluggish U.S. economy will derail
the global recovery.  The difference, or spread, between the two-year swap rate
and the comparable-maturity Treasury note yield climbed 2.12
basis points to 32.32 basis points as of 10:41 a.m. in New York.
The measure has risen from 23.37 since the end of July as
investor concern has mounted that Europe’s fiscal imbalances
will harm bank balance sheets. It added 3.7 basis points on
Sept. 9 to 34.89.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  Hovnanian Bonds  Hovnanian’s $797 million of 10.625 percent notes due in
October 2016 tumbled 4.4 cents to 75 cents on the dollar as of
10:31 a.m. in New York after a 5.3 cents drop yesterday,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The senior secured
bonds are yielding 18.5 percent, up from 15 percent on Sept. 27,
the data show.  The  Red Bank , New Jersey-based homebuilder is offering to
exchange senior notes with coupons ranging from 6.25 percent to
11.875 percent and maturities from 2014 through 2017 for up to
$220 million of new 2 percent senior secured bonds due 2021,
according to a statement distributed by Globe Newswire on Sept.
28. Hovnanian, the largest homebuilder in  New Jersey , said the
offer will expire on Oct. 26 and that the early tender and
consent time is at 5 p.m. in New York on Oct. 12.  Leveraged Loans  The S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index decreased 0.09
cent to 89.07 cents on the dollar. The measure, which tracks the
100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien leveraged loans, has
dropped from 94.22 on June 30 and fell to 87.47 on Aug. 26, the
lowest level since December 2009.  In emerging markets, relative yields rose 18 basis points
to 459 basis points, according to JPMorgan’s EMBI Global index.
The index has expanded from 259 basis points on Jan. 5 and 289
since the end of June.  Corporate bond offerings in the U.S. fell to $193.4 billion
in the third quarter versus $314.7 billion in the three months
ended June 30, Bloomberg data show. Issuance rebounded to $72.1
billion in September after falling last month to the lowest
level since May 2010.  Palo Alto , California-based Hewlett-Packard, raised $4.6
billion of debt on Sept. 13 in a four-part offering, Bloomberg
data show. Its $1.3 billion of 3 percent, five-year notes paid a
spread of 215 basis points, compared with a 90 basis point
spread on bonds with a similar maturity sold four months
earlier. Intel, the world’s biggest manufacturer of computer
chips, sold $5 billion of five-, 10- and 30-year bonds on Sept.
14 in its first offering of non-convertible debt since 1987,
Bloomberg data show.  Junk Bond Sales  U.S. junk-bond issuance fell 72 percent to $25.1 billion in
the third quarter, the least since speculative-grade borrowers
sold $12.2 billion during the three months through March 2009.
Offerings of the debt all but froze in August at $1 billion
after S&P cut the U.S. credit rating by one notch from AAA.
Companies priced $18 billion of high-yield bonds in July.  Spreads on U.S. speculative-grade bonds expanded 261 basis
points in the third quarter to 816, the widest since 820 in
October 2009, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.
Relative yields on investment-grade debt widened 90 basis points
to 254, the data show.  Investor Playbook  “The way investors looked at the third quarter was they
basically went back to the playbook from 2008 and 2009 and said
what matters the most was protecting their capital,” said Jim Casey co-head of syndication and leveraged finance at JPMorgan,
which helped manage 13.1 percent of U.S. junk-debt offerings in
the quarter, more than any other bank, Bloomberg data show.
“They were very concerned about principal and not particularly
worried about income.”  Banks worldwide issued $285.8 billion of debentures this
quarter, the least since they sold $204 billion in the final
three months of 2002, Bloomberg data show.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s biggest lender, sold 1.5
billion euros ($2.04 billion) of two-year floating-rate notes
yesterday that were priced at 98 basis points more than Euribor,
in the first sale of public, senior unsecured bonds by a
European bank in more than two months. The Frankfurt-based bank
raised 118.6 million euros by selling floating-rate securities
to domestic investors in July, paying no premium to Euribor,
Bloomberg data show.  Portugal, Ireland Cuts  Turmoil in the region had deterred issuers from tapping the
market as spreads on European investment-grade corporate bonds
widened 144 basis points to the most since May 2009. Spreads on
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s EMU Corporate Index were at 313
basis points on Sept. 26 and narrowed to 309 basis points
yesterday.  Investment-grade bond sales since the start of July dropped
to 58 billion euros, down 56 percent on the previous quarter and
61 percent from the third-quarter last year, Bloomberg data
show.  Moody’s cut Portugal’s debt ranking to Ba2, the second
level of junk, from Baa1 on July 5. The ranking company
downgraded Ireland to Ba1 from Baa3 a week later. It lowered
 Greece ’s rating to Ca on July 25 and S&P reduced its grade to an
equivalent CC two days later.  ‘Broken’  Bond Market   Contracts protecting against a default by the country for
five years rose to 60.6 percent upfront, according to data
provider CMA. That’s in addition to 5 percent a year, meaning it
would cost $6.06 million initially and $500,000 annually to
protect $10 million of Greece’s debt. The prices signaled a 98
percent chance of default within five years on Sept. 12, up from
about 80 percent on June 30.  While German lawmakers yesterday ratified expanded powers
for the region’s 440 billion-euro rescue fund to prevent a
default, investor concern has mounted the economic recovery is
faltering amid the ongoing sovereign debt turmoil.  “We’re still very much in the middle of an illiquid,
broken corporate bond market,” Simon Ballard, a credit
strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in London, said by telephone.
“Cash and capital preservation are still some of the key
driving strategies behind investment and for that reason
issuance has been very muted.”  The U.S. economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter, faster than the 1.2 percent median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, revised Commerce Department
figures showed yesterday. Gross domestic product may expand at a
“very modest” 2 percent rate in the second half of this year
as Europe’s crisis creates a “drag on growth,” wrote Adrian Miller, a New York-based fixed-income strategist at Miller Tabak
Roberts Securities LLC, in an e-mail yesterday.  “Market sentiment would suggest that a Greek default or a
restructuring of some kind has been anticipated,” Justin D’Ercole, head of investment-grade syndicate for the Americas at
 Barclays Capital  in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“The uncertainty around how that’s going to play out is what’s
holding all markets up.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
