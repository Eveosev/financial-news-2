ING Groep NV (INGA) , the biggest Dutch
financial services company, won’t provide further details on the
selling process of its 36 percent stake in SulAmerica, ING
spokesman Raymond Vermeulen said in an interview today.  ING plans to sell its stake in SulAmerica in a deal that
may be valued at $1 billion, the Financial Times reported today,
citing unidentified people close to the transaction.  “As you know we have to divest insurance operations before
the end of 2013. When we announced the sale of the Latin America
insurance unit we’ve indicated we plan to sell our stake in Sul
America separately,” ING’s Vermeulen added.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
