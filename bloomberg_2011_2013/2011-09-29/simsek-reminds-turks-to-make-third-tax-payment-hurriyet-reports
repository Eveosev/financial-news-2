Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek
warned Turks to remember to make payments for tax arrears due
tomorrow or risk losing a low-cost repayment schedule, Hurriyet
said.  Under the governmentâ€™s offer to waive fines on debts to the
state, anyone who misses two payments in a year will forfeit the
right to make use of the program and will face official pursuit
for the full sum, including fines and interest, Simsek said,
according to the Istanbul-based newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
