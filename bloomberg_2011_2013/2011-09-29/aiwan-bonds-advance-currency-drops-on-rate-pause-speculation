Taiwan’s dollar weakened on
speculation the central bank will leave borrowing costs
unchanged today as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatens to derail the
global economic recovery.  Government bonds  declined.  The monetary authority will keep the discount rate on 10-
day loans at 1.875 percent in a decision expected around 4:30
p.m. local time, according to 14 of 17 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The rest forecast a 0.125 percentage point increase.
The European Commission is resisting a push to impose bigger
writedowns on bank holdings of Greek sovereign debt than those
previously agreed on, a European official said.  “Investors are pretty much not expecting a rate rise
today,” said George Pu, a Taipei-based bond trader at President
Securities Corp. “Uncertainties over the global economic
recovery will be the main factor affecting  Taiwan  bond yields.”  Taiwan’s dollar retreated 0.1 percent to NT$30.44 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. The currency has weakened 4.7 percent this
month and 5.6 percent this quarter.  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due September 2021 rose
two basis points to 1.30 percent as of the 1:30 p.m. close in
Taipei, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. Benchmark 10-
year yields have dropped 13 basis points in September and 21
basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, this quarter.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was 0.398 percent from 0.394 percent
yesterday, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
