ATP Oil & Gas Corp.’s $1.5 billion
of 11.875 percent notes maturing in May 2015 dropped 5.75 cents
to 73 cents on the dollar today, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  The Houston-based petroleum and natural gas producer’s debt
is yielding 23.4 percent, the highest since at least January,
Trace data show. The debt has dropped from 102.5 cents at the
end of July, when it yielded 11 percent.  ATP shows a “high likelihood” it may face some type of
restructuring, analysts from Moody’s Investors Service wrote in
a Sept. 26 report. The company’s asset base and cash flows are
“not sufficient to cover” the second-lien notes, according to
the report. Moody’s assigns a Caa2 grade to ATP with a
“negative” outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
