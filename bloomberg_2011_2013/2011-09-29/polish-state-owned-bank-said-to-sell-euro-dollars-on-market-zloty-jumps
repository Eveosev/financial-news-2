Poland ’s state-owned Bank
Gospodarstwa Krajowego sold euros and dollars on the market,
helping pare the zloty’s steepest quarterly loss in 2 1/2 years.  The zloty jumped as much as 1.1 percent to 4.3943 against
 Europe ’s common currency and traded at 4.4166 against the euro
as of 5:44 p.m. in Warsaw. Before the bank stepped in the zloty
traded around 4.44 against the European common currency. Three
traders said they bought euros and dollars from the state-owned
bank, which sometimes acts on the  Finance Ministry ’s behalf.
They declined to be named because the information isn’t public.  Poland’s central bank sold foreign currencies on the market
on Sept. 23, stepping in to bolster the zloty for the first time
in at least a decade. BGK separately sold euro and dollars to
bank and bought  government bonds  the same day, said two traders
involved in the transactions.  Joint action by the central bank and BGK sent an
“important signal” to investors and has stopped speculation
against the zloty, Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said in an
interview on Radio RMF FM on Sept. 27.  The zloty depreciated to its weakest level against the euro
in almost 27 months last week. It has been the world’s worst
performing currency with a 9.9 percent decline against the euro
this quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
