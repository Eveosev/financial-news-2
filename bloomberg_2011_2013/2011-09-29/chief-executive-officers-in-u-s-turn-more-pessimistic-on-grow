Chief executive officers in the
U.S. turned more pessimistic in the third quarter as sales
projections dropped, darkening the outlook for employment and
investment, a survey showed.  The  Business Roundtable ’s economic outlook index fell to
77.6, the lowest reading since the last three months of 2009,
from 109.9 in the second quarter, the Washington-based group
said today. Readings higher than 50 are consistent with economic
expansion. Survey participants also reduced forecasts for growth
this year to 1.8 percent, compared with a 2.8 percent gain
predicted in the prior quarterly survey.  “While we see strong business fundamentals in America
still, the quarterly survey results reflect increased
uncertainty among CEOs concerning the economic climate and
business environment,” Jim McNerney, chairman of the Business
Roundtable and chief executive officer of Boeing Co., said in a
statement today.  Sixty-five percent of executives said they expect sales
will grow in the next six months, down from 87 percent in the
second quarter, the survey showed. Thirty-six percent said they
will increase payrolls, a 15-point drop from the previous three
months, and 32 percent plan to invest in capital equipment, a
decline of 29 percentage points.  The survey, taken from Aug. 29 to Sept. 16, represented the
responses of 140 company leaders.  The Business Roundtable is an association of CEOs of
corporations representing a combined workforce of 14 million
employees and more than $6 trillion in annual revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
