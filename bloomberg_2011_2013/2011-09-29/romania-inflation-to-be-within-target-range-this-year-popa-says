Romanian inflation will “very
likely” fall within the central bank’s target range of 2
percent to 4 percent this year, Deputy Governor Cristian Popa
said.  The country’s currency, the leu, is among the most stable
in the region, with recent moves “not dramatic,” he told
reporters in the capital, Bucharest, today.  The central bank may lower its 2012 economic-growth
forecast because of slower global output, Popa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
