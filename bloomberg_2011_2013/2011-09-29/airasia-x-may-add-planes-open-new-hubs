AirAsia X Sdn. , the long-haul
affiliate of  Asia ’s biggest discount carrier, may add at least
60 more aircraft to support possible hubs in Japan and
Australia.  The carrier, which has a backlog of 30 Airbus SAS planes,
“could triple our orders,” Chief Executive Officer Azran Osman Rani said in an interview in Tokyo yesterday. “The existing
orders are conservative.” He declined to give specific details
on how many planes the carrier may add or when.  Kuala Lumpur-based AirAsia X may open a base in Japan to
work with affiliate AirAsia Bhd.’s planned venture in the
country, Rani said. The long-haul carrier and Qantas Airways
Ltd.’s Jetstar have won passengers from full-service carriers in
Asia with low fares, prompting  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  to draw
up plans for its own budget long-haul unit.  AirAsia X may eventually operate flights to Guam and
Honolulu from Japan on behalf of AirAsia Bhd.’s venture with All
Nippon Airways Co., Rani said. The long-haul carrier, which
currently flies to cities including London from Malaysia, may
also open a base in Australia.  “A unit in Australia is definitely a possibility,” Rani
said. Still, it will probably take at least two years before
this happens, he said.  AirAsia X’s plans to hold an initial public offering have
been delayed by talks to sell a 10 percent stake to Khazanah
Nasional Bhd., Malaysia’s state-controlled investment company,
Rani said. The sale is part of a wider deal that also included
the purchase of a stake in Malaysian Airline System Bhd. by  Tony Fernandes  and other  AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA)  shareholders.  AirAsia X is currently owned by AirAsia Bhd., Richard Branson’s Virgin Group Ltd., Manara Consortium, based in
Bahrain, and  ORIX Corp. (8591) , based in Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
