Hungary  may sell foreign-currency
denominated bonds this year to prefinance 2012,  Mihaly Varga ,
chief of staff to Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , told reporters
today.  “It depends on the international situation,” Varga said.
“There is always a risk that if it doesn’t turn out as planned,
then that hurts confidence. We have to wait with this and watch
the market.”  The country completed its 4 billion-euro ($5.5 billion)
2011 foreign-currency financing plan with the sale of euro- and
dollar-denominated bonds in the first half of the year. Gyula
Pleschinger, chief executive officer of the state Debt
Management Agency, said in an interview last month that he
wasn’t planning any further foreign debt sales this year.  Hungary, which was the first European Union member to
receive an International Monetary Fund-led emergency loan in
2008 to avert a default, isn’t considering obtaining a new loan
from the IMF, Varga said today.  The country will repay 3.2 billion euros to the IMF and the
European Union next year, pushing the amount of maturing foreign
debt to 4.5 billion euros, Pleschinger said in the August
interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
