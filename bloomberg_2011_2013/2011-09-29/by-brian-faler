The  U.S. Congress  gave final
approval to a stopgap budget measure needed to avert a
government shutdown.  With lawmakers on recess this week, the House used a voice
vote in a pro-forma session today to pass the legislation
funding the government until Oct. 4. It was approved Sept. 26 by
the Senate and now goes to President  Barack Obama  for his
signature. The government’s new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.  The bill is the result of a bipartisan deal reached earlier
this week to end a standoff over financing disaster assistance
that had threatened a government shutdown.  The House plans on Oct. 4 to consider a second stopgap
budget measure approved by the Senate that would keep federal
agencies operating until Nov. 18.  Today’s bill is H.R. 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
