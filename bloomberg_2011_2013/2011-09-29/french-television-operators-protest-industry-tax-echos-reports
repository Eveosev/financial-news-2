French television operators,
including mobile-telephone companies, are protesting plans to
maintain tax rates on their services that were imposed in 2008,
 Les Echos  reported, citing the companies.  The government plans to raise 180 million euros ($245
million) in 2012 from the tax on total revenue of broadcasters
including  Societe Television Francaise 1 (TFI)  and  France Telecom SA (FTE) â€™s
Orange brand, the French daily newspaper said. Authorities
failed to cut the rate after raising value-added tax last year,
 Les Echos  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
