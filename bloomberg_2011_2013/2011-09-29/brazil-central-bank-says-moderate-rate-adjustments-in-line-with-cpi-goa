Brazil ’s central bank said moderate
adjustments in the country’s benchmark interest rate are in line
with its forecast for inflation to fall to the 4.5 percent
target in 2012.  “The monetary policy committee understands that by
mitigating the effects of a more restrictive global environment
in a timely manner, moderate adjustments in the basic rate are
consistent with its scenario of inflation converging toward the
target in 2012,´´ policy makers said in their quarterly
inflation report published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
