Croatia  will ask the European
Commission to approve a law capping  INA  Industrija Nafte d.d.’s
non-state holdings at 49 percent, Prime Minister  Jadranka Kosor 
said.  Kosor said the limit would “probably be temporary”  until
a verdict is reached in the case of former Premier Ivo Sanader,
who last week was charged in a bribery case surrounding Mol
Nyrt.’s takeover of the Croatian refiner.  Croatia concluded membership talks with the European Union
in June and expects to join the trading bloc in July 2013.
Kosor’s plan to restrict the ownership in INA risks running
afoul of EU rules, analysts have said.  “Our duty is to protect our strategic interests, and I
hope that our colleagues in Brussels will be understanding,”
Kosor said today.  Sanader is accused of taking a bribe of 10 million euros
($13.6 million) from  Hungary ’s largest refiner between 2008 to
2009, when he was premier. In exchange, he allegedly arranged
with a high-ranking Mol manager to give it controlling rights
over INA in a January 2009 shareholding agreement, according to
the Prosecutor General’s office.  Hungary’s Mol, which controls the Croatian refiner, holds
47.47 percent, with an option to buy another 1.6 percent. The
government owns 44.84 percent.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
