SLM Corp. (SLM) , the student lender known
as  Sallie Mae , plans to sell $817 million of bonds backed by
student loans after relative yields jumped as  Europe â€™s debt
crisis roiled credit markets.  The securities will be tied to debt guaranteed by the U.S.
government, according to a regulatory filing today. JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are managing
the transaction for the Newark, Delaware-based company, the
filing said.  Sallie Mae last sold similar debt on May 19, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. About $14 billion in asset-backed
bonds tied to education loans have been issued in 2011, or 12
percent of asset-backed securities sold this year, Bloomberg
data show. Approximately $51 billion of total issuance is tied
to auto debt.  Securities backed by  student loans  are yielding 188 basis
points, or 1.88 percentage points, more than Treasuries, from
168 basis points on June 30, according to a Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index. Spreads expanded to 192 basis points on
Sept. 12, the widest since February, the index data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
