Jitendra Panda, head of broking at
 Future Capital Holdings Ltd. (FCHL) , comments on the outlook for Indian
stocks. Panda spoke on phone from Mumbai.  The benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index fell 0.4 percent to
16,374.06 at 11:15 a.m.  On European debt crisis:  “The problems in  Europe  will bring volatility in markets.
Investors will be cautious and markets will be on the downside.
Europe will be risk-averse, and that will dent earnings this
fiscal year.  ‘‘In the next few days, due to risks, markets will be very
volatile and may reach bottom.’’  On investment strategy:  ‘‘Investors should start nibbling into some large-cap
stocks. Because commodity prices have corrected, inflation will
be taken care of and the banking sector will do well. The auto
sector will also do well because of the festive season.  ‘‘Investors should avoid the information technology sector
because values have moved up and there’s no margin of safety.’’  ‘‘Right now, valuations are looking reasonable. Based on
guidance, we’ll be able to take further cues for the next
year.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
