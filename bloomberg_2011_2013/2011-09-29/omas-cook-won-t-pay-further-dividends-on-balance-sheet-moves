Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG)  won’t pay
dividends while working to rebuild its balance sheet, the U.K.
tour operator said today in a statement.  The company will pay its previously declared dividend of
3.75 pence a share due on Oct. 7, the company said. Cash flow
has been “strong” in the fiscal year ending this month, and
underlying profit is “in line” with analyst estimates, it
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
