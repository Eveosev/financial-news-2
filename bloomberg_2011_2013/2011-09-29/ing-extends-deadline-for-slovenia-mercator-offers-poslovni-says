ING Bank NV extended the deadline
to collect offers on  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d. until Oct.
17,  Poslovni Dnevnik  reported today without saying how it got
the information.  Slovenian banks and other stakeholders in the regionâ€™s
biggest supermarket chain last month appointed the London-based
investment bank to oversee the sale of just over 50 percent of
Mercator, the Zagreb-based business newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
