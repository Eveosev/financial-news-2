Almost half of tuberculosis
patients with a strain resistant to two or more drugs hadn’t had
the disease before, according to a  study  at a Chinese hospital.  Of 100 multidrug-resistant TB cases studied at Shandong
Provincial Tuberculosis Hospital, 45 weren’t previously treated
for the lung infection, doctors at the Chinese Center for
Disease Control and Prevention found. The finding, published in
the October edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases journal,
indicates “substantial” transmission of the deadly superbug,
the authors said.  Many of the affected had the so-called Beijing genotype,
which is prevalent in  China  and has spread to the rest of Asia,
the former Soviet republic and South Africa. An estimated
120,000 people catch multidrug-resistant TB each year in China,
which has the most cases globally after  India .  “The largest amount of people with tuberculosis in the
world are in China and India by a long, long way,” said Warwick
Britton, professor of immunology at the University of Sydney.
“And so to really control TB in the world you’ve got to control
TB in China.”  Most of the patients in the study were previously treated,
lacked health insurance, or less educated, according to the
study.  Drug-resistant tuberculosis is spreading in  Europe  at an
“alarming rate,” the World Health Organization said Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story: Natasha Khan in  Hong Kong
