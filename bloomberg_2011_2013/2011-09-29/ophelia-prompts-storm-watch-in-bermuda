Ophelia became the fourth hurricane
of the 2011 Atlantic season, prompting a tropical storm watch in
 Bermuda  as its winds reached 75 miles (121 kilometers) per hour
and threatened to grow stronger.  Ophelia is a Category 1 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-
Simpson scale and is about 770 miles south-southeast of Bermuda,
where winds of 39 mph may arrive in two days, according to a 5
p.m. New York time center  advisory .  “Some additional strengthening is forecast during the next
day or so,” the center said.  Ophelia is one of 16 storms that have formed in the
Atlantic this year, making this an above-average season. The
typical Atlantic season, which lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30,
produces 11 named storms with winds of at least 39 mph,
according to the hurricane center.  The hurricane should track far enough to the east of
Bermuda so that the strongest winds may only be about 45 mph,
 Jeff Masters , co-founder of  Weather Underground  Inc., wrote on
his blog.  “We can’t rule out the possibility that Bermuda will
receive hurricane-force winds yet, but the odds are low,” wrote
Masters in  Ann Arbor ,  Michigan .  Ophelia’s hurricane strength winds of at least 74 mph
extend 25 miles from its center. Its tropical storm-strength
winds reach out 175 miles.  There is a 40 percent chance that Bermuda and southern
Newfoundland will be struck by tropical storm force, according
to a hurricane center projection.  Philippe Forecast  To the east of Ophelia, Tropical Storm Philippe churned in
the Atlantic about 1,210 miles east of the Leeward Islands,
which includes the  U.S. Virgin Islands , with winds of 45 mph,
according to the center. It is moving northwest at 13 mph.  The hurricane center’s latest track forecast has it holding
together as a tropical storm into early next week as it
continues east across the ocean. Earlier today it was expected
to weaken to a tropical depression.  In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Hilary strengthened and now
has top winds of 50 mph, up from 45 mph earlier today, as it
moves north-northwest at 9 mph, according to the center. The
storm is 695 miles west of  Baja California .  To contact the reporters on this story:
