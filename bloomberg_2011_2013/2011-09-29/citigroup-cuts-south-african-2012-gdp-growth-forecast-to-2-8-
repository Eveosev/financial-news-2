Citigroup Inc. cuts its 2012
forecast for South African economic growth to 2.8 percent from
3.5 percent, said Jean-Francois Mercier, an economist at the
bank in Johannesburg.  The economy will probably expand 3 percent this year,
compared with 3.4 percent estimated previously, Mercier said in
a phone interview today. The current-account deficit is forecast
to widen to 4.7 percent of gross domestic product in 2012 from
3.3 percent this year, Citigroup said in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
