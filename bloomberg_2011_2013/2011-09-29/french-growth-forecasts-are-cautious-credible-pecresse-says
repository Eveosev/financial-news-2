The French government’s forecast of
1.75 percent growth in 2012 is “cautious and credible,” Budget
Minister Valerie Pecresse said, dismissing claims by some
economists that it’s too optimistic.  Speaking on France Inter radio, Pecresse said the
government will stick to its budget deficit targets regardless
of how growth turns out.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
