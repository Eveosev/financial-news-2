Rye Select Broad Market XL
Portfolio Ltd., sued by the liquidator of  Bernard Madoff ’s firm,
asked a federal district judge to take the case out of U.S.
bankruptcy court, citing a ruling on the trustee’s
$1 billion lawsuit against the owners of the New York Mets.  Cayman Islands-based Rye is a defendant in a larger lawsuit
involving transfers of funds allegedly originating at the Madoff
money management firm, via swap transactions, according to
trustee  Irving Picard ’s lawsuit. Picard demands the return of
$400 million from Rye Portfolio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
