The yuan was a more popular
currency for corporate bond sales than the euro for the first
time in the third quarter according to data by Dealogic, the
Financial Times reported.  Dealogic data showed yuan-denominated corporate bond
issuance by non-financial companies remained relatively steady
at the equivalent of $31.1 billion in the quarter, while euro-
denominated sales more than halved to $26.4 billion, the FT
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
