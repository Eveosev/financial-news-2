  Colombia , where coffee farms and
coal mines were battered by storms last year, said the La Nina
weather pattern that caused the rainfall may return as soon as
this year.  Colombia is monitoring water temperatures in the  Pacific
Ocean  that suggest the risk a weaker La Nina weather pattern
than last year may return at yearend or early next year, the
head of the nation’s weather agency Ricardo Lozano said in an
interview today on Bogota-based Caracol Radio.   Rainfall last year led to lower production at coal mines
and reduced exports of coffee from Colombia, the world’s second-
largest producer of Arabica beans. The nation also is  South
America ’s largest coal producer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
