Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose after U.S. initial jobless claims fell more than
estimated and German lawmakers backed an enhanced euro-region
rescue fund, improving the earnings outlook for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , Japan’s
largest mobile-phone operator by market value, rose 0.9 percent
from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Advantest Corp. (6857) ,
a maker of memory-chip testers, fell 0.4 percent after a drop by
the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks the
performance of 30 industry stocks. ADRs of Telstra Corp.,
Australia’s biggest telephone company, rose 0.3 percent, and
Alumina Ltd., a resources company, climbed 0.9 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 8,730 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
8,710 in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,720
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index rose 0.5 percent today.  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index
advanced 0.3 percent in Wellington.  “Slightly positive economic data in the U.S. lifted the
mood,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based
Nomura Holdings Inc. “We got a reprieve for Europe’s debt
crisis.”  Japan’s industrial production rose 1.5 percent in August
after advancing 0.4 percent in July, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the
government releases the data today.  Jobless Claims  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent today. In  New York , the index rose 0.8 percent yesterday
after applications for jobless benefits dropped by 37,000 last
week to 391,000, the fewest since April, Labor Department
figures showed. Economists forecast 420,000 claims, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  A separate report showed the  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.3
percent pace in the second quarter, faster than initially
estimated, helped by exports and spending on services.  Global equities advanced yesterday after Germany’s lower
house of parliament approved the expansion of the European
bailout fund. The bill’s passage by Europe’s biggest economy
allows euro-area officials to weigh further measures to bolster
Greece in its sovereign-debt crisis and stem investor concern.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 17 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 7.7 percent drop by the  S&P
500  and a 17 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
