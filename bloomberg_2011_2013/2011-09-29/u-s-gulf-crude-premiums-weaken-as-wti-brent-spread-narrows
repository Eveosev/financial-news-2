U.S. Gulf crude premiums weakened
after the discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent
narrowed.  The gap between WTI and Brent November contracts decreased
79 cents to $21.81 a barrel in  New York . The spread settled
Sept. 6 at a record margin of $26.87.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI declined $1 to
$25.25 a barrel at 1:59 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium dropped
65 cents to $24.10.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend lost $1 to $21 a barrel while Poseidon weakened 65 cents
to $20.85 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed 75 cents to $19.75
a barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at 90
cents a barrel below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium lost 60 cents
to $25 above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was weakened 90 cents to $7.75 a
barrel, the smallest since July 1. Syncrude is a light, low-
sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 5 cents to
$10.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
