Taiwan â€™s central bank left  interest
rates  unchanged yesterday, ending five straight quarters of
increases as price pressures ease and a faltering global
recovery threatens its export-dependent economy.  The central bank kept the discount rate on 10-day loans to
banks at 1.875 percent. Fourteen of the 17 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News predicted the decision. Three expected an
increase to 2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
