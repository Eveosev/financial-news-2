Wilbur Ross , the chairman of WL
Ross & Co., said  New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie  would be a
strong candidate for the Republican presidential nomination
should he decide to run.  “He is very impressive,” Ross said today in an interview
with Betty Liu on Bloomberg Television. “His speeches have been
very impressive. I just hope if he does run, he has the fire in
the belly and really wants to do it.”  Christie, 49, the first-term governor and former U.S.
Attorney for New Jersey, has said he plans to sit out the 2012
presidential race.  Ross said today he has reached no conclusion on the
candidates who have declared for the Republican nomination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
