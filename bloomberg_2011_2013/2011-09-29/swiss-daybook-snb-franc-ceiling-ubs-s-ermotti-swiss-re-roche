The Swiss central bank’s franc
ceiling of 1.20 versus the euro is “very, very credible,” Vice
President Thomas Jordan said.  The  Swiss National Bank  will use “all measures” to defend
it, Jordan said at an event in  Basel ,  Switzerland , late
yesterday. He declined to comment on whether policy makers will
raise the cap, saying the Zurich-based central bank is taken
“seriously in the market.”  EQUITIES:
