shares in New York trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses and

Securities and Exchange Commission Enforcement Director  Robert
Khuzami  said the  Department of Justice  is reviewing allegations
of accounting fraud at firms operating out of the Asian nation.
The declines in at least four companies triggered a short sale
restriction by the SEC that forces traders who want to bet on a
further drop to wait after the stocks fell 10 percent from the

previously estimated in the second quarter.  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  , China’s largest offshore energy
producer, advanced 2.9 percent to an eight-day high of $168.92.  PetroChina Co. (PTR US) the nation’s biggest oil producer,
