The U.K.’s Financial Services
Authority fined Towry Investment Management Ltd. 494,000 pounds
($773,000) for misleading the regulator and failing to comply
with client money rules, the FSA said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The company “failed to maintain adequate records” of
client money and provided “inaccurate information” to the FSA,
the regulator said. Towry earned a 30 percent discount on the
fine by agreeing to settle at an early stage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
