HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA (HRTP3) , a
Brazilian oil company exploring in the Amazon and Namibia,
gained the most in two weeks after TNK-BP agreed to pay $1
billion for a stake in its  Brazil  exploration areas.  HRT rose 7.7 percent to 785 reais in Sao Paulo trading at
4:15 p.m. New York time. The stock has fallen 51 percent so far
this year.  TNK-BP, Russia’s third-largest oil producer, agreed to buy
a 45 percent stake in exploration blocks in the Solimoes Basin
where HRT recently found signs of oil and will complete the
transaction in two to three weeks, Sergey Funygin, head of TNK-
BP’s Venezuela division, said yesterday at an oil conference in
Puerto la Cruz,  Venezuela .  TNK-BP Chief Executive Officer Mikhail Fridman will travel
to Rio this week to complete the deal after the boards of both
companies approved the terms, an official at HRT’s investment
relations department, who declined to be named because of
company policy, said in a telephone interview today.  TNK-BP is buying the stake from Petra Energia SA, HRT’s
original partner in the blocks, through an accord giving HRT the
right to buy Petra’s stake. TNK-BP is seeking opportunities in
Brazil, Africa, the Middle East and  Latin America  to diversify
operations, Funygin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
