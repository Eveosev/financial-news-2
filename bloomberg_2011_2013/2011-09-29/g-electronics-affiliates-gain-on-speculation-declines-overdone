LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  and other LG
Group units advanced in Seoul trading on speculation recent
declines in their share price were overdone.  LG Electronics, the world’s third-largest mobile-phone
maker, surged 13 percent to 69,800 won as of 2:49 p.m. on the
Korea Exchange. LG Innotek Co., a light-emitting diode maker,
and LG Display Co., the world’s second-largest liquid-crystal
display maker, both advanced more than 10 percent.  LG Electronics dropped 25 percent this quarter through
yesterday. LG Innotek and LG Display slipped 39 percent for the
same period, while the benchmark Kospi Index sank 18 percent.  “It’s excessively undervalued,” Park Won Jae, an analyst
with Daewoo Securities Co., said in a report today on LG
Electronics. “Opportunities are also rising for LG as mobile-
phone carriers introduce more-advanced services, in which the
company has made a lot of investments.”  The recent decline in LG Display’s share-price has left its
valuation attractive, even as panel prices are unlikely to
recover soon, Kim Byung Ki, an analyst with Kiwoom Securities
Co., said by phone today. The stock trades at 0.7 times
estimated book value, compared with a 1.15 multiple in the  Kospi
Index (KOSPI) , according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
