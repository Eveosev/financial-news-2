Ecuador ’s President  Rafael Correa 
said today the U.S. is financing corrupt police officers in the
South American nation, Diario Hoy reported.  Correa said groups of “very corrupt” Ecuadorean police
forces have been “financed by the U.S. Embassy,” the Quito-
based newspaper said today in its online  edition . Correa said
current relations with the U.S. are good, Hoy said.  Today’s comments come three weeks after the two nations
nominated new ambassadors following a diplomatic spat in April
when Correa expelled the previous U.S. ambassador over a cable
published by anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks alleging corruption in
the South American nation’s police force.  Veronica Alvarez, Ecuador’s subsecretary of information,
declined to comment immediately when contacted by telephone
today. The U.S. Embassy didn’t immediately respond to a
telephone message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
