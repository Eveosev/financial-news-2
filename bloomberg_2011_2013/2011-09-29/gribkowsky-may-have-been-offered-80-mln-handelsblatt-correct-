(Corrects to show the money was offered to Gribkowsky in
first paragraph.)  Gerhard Gribkowsky, a former
Bayerische Landesbank risk manager, may have been offered as
much as $80 million by Formula One Chief Executive Officer
 Bernie Ecclestone , Handelsblatt reported, citing a document from
Munich prosecutors.  This is more than previously reported, the newspaper said.
Sven Thomas, Ecclestone’s lawyer, did not immediately return a
call from Bloomberg News seeking comment. Handelsblatt said
Gribkowsky’s lawyer did not answer detailed questions on the
issue and Ecclestone’s lawyer did not want to comment on the
question.  Gribkowsky and Ecclestone said the payments had nothing to
do with the sale of Formula One shares, Handelsblatt reported.
Gribkowsky’s lawyer Rainer Bruessow said in August that there is
no evidence supporting the allegations against his client.  A German regional court allowed breach of trust, accepting
bribes and tax evasion charges against Gribkowsky, it said on
Sept. 26. The trial over the sale of the lender’s stake in
Formula One racing is set to start Oct. 24, the regional court
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
