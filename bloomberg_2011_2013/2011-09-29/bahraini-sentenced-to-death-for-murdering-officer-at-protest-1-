Bahrain’s National Safety Appeals
Court sentenced a man to death for the murder of a policeman
during anti-government demonstrations this year and handed down
prison sentences to 20 medics, Bahrain News Agency said today.  Ali Youssef Abdul-Wahab was sentenced to death in
connection with the killing of officer Ahmed Muraysi, the state-
run agency said. A second man, Attia Ali Mahdi, received a life
sentence.  Twenty medics received sentences ranging from five to 15
years for occupying Salmaniya Medical Complex during the rallies
in February and March, possessing weapons and for seeking to
overthrow the government, BNA said.  “The sentences are a message to the international
community that the Bahraini regime is unconcerned about basic
human rights,” the opposition al-Wefaq party, the largest
Shiite group, said in an e-mailed statement.  The medics can appeal to Bahrain’s highest civilian court,
the Information Affairs Authority said in an e-mailed statement.
It said the hospital was used as a coordination center for three
weeks for protests calling for the overthrow of the government.  “Those doctors who have been found guilty were charged
with abusing the hospital for political purposes,” the
statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
