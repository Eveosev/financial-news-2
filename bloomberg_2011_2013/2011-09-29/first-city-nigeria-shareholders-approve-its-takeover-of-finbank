First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB)  of
 Nigeria  shareholders approved the acquisition of  FinBank Plc (FIRSTINL)  a
day before the central bank recapitalization deadline for
bailed-out lenders, First City Chairman Jonathan Long said in
Lagos.  FinBank’s investors consented to the takeover at a separate
meeting today in Abuja, the capital, Theo Chike Osanakpo,
chairman of the lender, told reporters.  “The steps taken today will create some measure of value
to the shareholders that has the potential to be enhanced upon
with this new arrangement,” Osanakpo said.  The Lagos-based lender was one of eight banks whose top
executives were fired by the  Central Bank of Nigeria  after loans
to equity speculators contributed to non-performing debt that
put the banking industry on the verge of collapse. The lenders
were bailed out by the  central bank  two years ago with the
injection of 620 billion naira ($4 billion). Regulators gave the
lenders until Sept. 30 to recapitalize.  Three lenders, Afribank Plc, Bank PHB Plc and Spring Bank
Plc were nationalized by the government on Aug. 5 after they
were deemed unlikely to meet the recapitalization deadline.  First City’s shares gained the most in two months, trading
4.9 percent higher at 4.06 naira by the close in Lagos. The
stock’s 46 percent decline this year outpaces the Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index’s 19 percent drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
