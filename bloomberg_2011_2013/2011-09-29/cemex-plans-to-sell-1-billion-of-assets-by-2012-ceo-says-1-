Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker
in the Americas, plans to sell about $1 billion of assets by the
end of 2012 to reduce debt, Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Zambrano said.  Businesses that don’t generate at least a 10 percent return
on capital over time will be sold, Zambrano said in a webcast of
a meeting with analysts today in  New York . The company, based in
the Monterrey,  Mexico , suburb of San Pedro Garza Garcia, plans
to sell $180 million of assets this year, he said.  Cemex, which had $17.8 billion in debt at the end of the
second quarter, will meet bank covenants for 2011 and 2012
without renegotiating or selling equity, Zambrano said. The
company will instead rely on asset sales, cost cuts, lower
energy costs and management of working capital, he said.  “There are many things working in our favor and that’s why
I’m optimistic,” Zambrano said.  Cemex rose 1 centavo, or 0.2 percent, to 4.74 pesos at 4:10
p.m. New York time in Mexico City trading.  The shares prior to today had tumbled 46 percent since the
company in July reported its seventh straight net loss and said
second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell about 7 percent to $615 million. Analysts had
speculated Cemex would need to renegotiate a covenant that
required a debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 7 times or less after the
ratio rose to 7.16 times for the second quarter.  The  Mexican peso  also weakened 13 percent since the end of
June, hurting profits denominated in dollars.  Pessimism Is ‘Overdone’  Cemex had obtained a $15 billion  bank loan  in August 2009
to avoid default after U.S. cement demand plummeted following
the company’s $14.2 billion acquisition of Rinker Group Ltd.,
which had more than 80 percent of sales in the U.S.  The company has identified $800 million of real estate that
it plans to sell, $500 million of which will be sold by the end
of 2012, Juan Pablo San Agustin, Cemex’s strategic planning
chief, said during the meeting. The company expects to raise
another $500 million on the sale of idle assets that don’t
produce Ebitda by the end of next year, he said.  Ebitda will grow next year, Zambrano said, and U.S.
operations, which have been losing money, will be profitable.
For 2011, Cemex forecasts cement volume will rise 1 percent from
a year ago and ready-mix concrete volume will expand 5 percent,
Zambrano said.  It will take the cement market five years to recover to
“mid-cycle” levels, Zambrano said. At mid-cycle, Cemex should
have Ebitda of $4.5 billion to $5 billion, and the U.S.
operations’ should be $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, he said.  “Frankly, I think the pessimism in financial markets is
more than a bit overdone,” Zambrano said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
