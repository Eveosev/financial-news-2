Credit-default swaps insuring
government and corporate debt rose on concern  Europe ’s deepening
debt crisis will trigger a global economic slump.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased four basis points to 337 at 10:15 a.m. in
London. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was up 2.5 basis points at 195,
JPMorgan Chase & Co prices show. Increases signal worsening
perceptions of  credit quality .  Global investors anticipate Europe’s debt crisis leading to
an economic slump, financial meltdown and social unrest in the
next year, with 72 percent predicting a country abandoning the
euro within five years, according to a Bloomberg survey. A Greek
default is inevitable and there’s a 35 percent chance of the
euro-area economy slipping back into recession, Ernst & Young
LLP said.  “There is also growing division on what happens with
 Greece  and whether private creditors are set to face more
aggressive writedowns,”  Jim Reid , head of fundamental strategy
at Deutsche Bank AG in London, wrote in a note.  Default swaps on  Germany  rose two basis points to 106 and
contracts linked to French debt increased four to 182. Italy was
up four basis points at 466 and Spanish swaps climbed four to
384. Contracts on Ireland dropped two basis points to 715.  It costs $6.17 million upfront and $100,000 annually to
insure $10 million of Greek debt for five years.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 9 basis
points to 810, snapping four days of declines, according to
JPMorgan. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior
debt of 25 banks and insurers dropped two basis points to 264
and the subordinated gauge was down three at 503.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
