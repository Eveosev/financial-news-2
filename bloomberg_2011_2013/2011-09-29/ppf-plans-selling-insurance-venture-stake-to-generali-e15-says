PPF, a private-equity group
controlled by Czech billionaire Petr Kellner, plans to sell its
stake in an insurance venture it has with  Italy â€™s Assicurazioni
Generali SpA,  E15  reported without saying where it got the
information.  PPF has an option to sell the 49 percent stake in Generali
PPF Holding to its Italian partner in 2013, the newspaper said.
The Czech group seeks to speed up the sale of the stake, which
was worth as much as 3 billion euros (4 billion) at the start of
2011, E15 said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
