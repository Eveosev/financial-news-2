Italy  sold 7.9 billion euros
($10.77 billion) in bonds, less than the maximum target, as
borrowing costs rose amid contagion from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 3.14 billion euros of bonds
due in 2014 to yield 4.68 percent, compared with a yield of 3.87
percent at the last auction on Aug. 30. Demand was 1.36 times
the amount sold, compared with 1.32 times at the last sale. Also
sold were 2.47 billion euros of 2022 bonds to yield 5.86
percent, compared with 5.22 percent on Aug. 30.  The Treasury also auctioned 1.3 billion euros of 2021 bonds
to yield 5.49 percent, and 926 million euros in floating-rate
2015 bonds to yield 5.63 percent. Italy planned to sell as much
as 9 billion euros in bonds.  “Today’s auction was not strong at all,” Annalisa Piazza,
a fixed-income strategist at Newedge Group SA in  London , wrote
in a note to investors. “Market participants don’t seem to bet
on a solid recovery” in Europe’s peripheral economies “any
time soon.”  Italy’s borrowing costs surged to euro-era records last
month as  Greece ’s slide toward default fueled concern the
country with the region’s second-biggest debt would become the
next victim of the sovereign crisis. The  European Central Bank 
began buying Italian securities on Aug. 8 and bonds have since
given back much of the initial gains triggered by the purchases.  The yield on Italy’s benchmark 10-year bond rose 1 basis
point to 5.656 percent as of 12:05 p.m. in Rome, pushing up the
premium investors demand to hold the security over equivalent-
maturity German bunds to 368 basis points. That compares with
363 basis points yesterday and a euro-era record close of 398
basis points on Sept. 21.  Italy sold 750 million euros of inflation-linked bonds
yesterday. Investors offered 2.1 times the amount of the
securities on offer. The country still has almost 90 billion
euros in bills and longer-term debt maturing this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
