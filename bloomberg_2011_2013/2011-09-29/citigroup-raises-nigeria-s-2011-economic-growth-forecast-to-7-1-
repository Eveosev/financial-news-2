Citigroup Inc. raised its economic
growth forecast for  Nigeria  this year to 7.1 percent from 6.8
percent,  David Cowan , an economist at the bank, said in an e-
mailed report.  The economy will probably expand 6.7 percent in 2012,
according to the report. Fiscal discipline, higher  interest
rates  and an increase in oil production may help the central
bank maintain “stability” in the naira, Cowan said in the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
