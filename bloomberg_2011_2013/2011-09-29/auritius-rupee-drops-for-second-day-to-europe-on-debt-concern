Mauritius’s rupee declined for a
second day against the euro as a delay in measures to resolve
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis curbed demand for assets from
markets that depend on trade with the region.  The currency of the Indian Ocean island nation depreciated
as much as 0.9 percent to 39.8549 per euro and traded 0.2
percent down at 39.5500by 1:58 p.m., in Port Louis, the capital.
Versus the dollar, main currency of the nation’s imports bills,
the rupee gained 0.2 percent to 28.95.  European confidence in the economic outlook dropped more
than economists forecast in September to the lowest in almost
two years, reflecting growing concern that the worsening debt
crisis could push the euro-area economy into a recession. Greek
government bonds rose as German lawmakers backed an expansion of
the euro-area rescue fund. Greek Prime Minister  George
Papandreou  holds a cabinet meeting to discuss the 2012 budget
and reduction of spending.  “No one really knows where this debt-loaded Greek ship is
heading, with the situation being made worse by the fact there
seems to be several captains on board,” analysts from Mauritius
Commercial Bank, the country’s largest lender by market value,
said in an e-mailed note to clients today.  Europe is the country’s main trading partner, buying almost
two-thirds of Mauritian manufactured goods, according to
Statistic Mauritius. Sixty-two percent of tourists were from
Europe in the eight months through August, data from the
Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority show.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 28.0483 to 28.2162
and the selling price declined to 29.5407 compared with 29.5948
yesterday, according to  exchange rates  published today on the
Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
