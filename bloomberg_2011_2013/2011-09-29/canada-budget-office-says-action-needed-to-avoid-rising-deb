Canadian governments will need to
make “permanent and immediate fiscal actions” totaling 2.7
percent of output in order to ensure the nation’s debt levels
don’t rise above current levels, the country’s parliamentary
budget office said in a report today.  The Parliamentary Budget Office released a report on fiscal
sustainability that estimated an ageing population will slow
growth and boost health-care costs and elderly benefits that
would increase combined government debts to more than 400
percent of GDP by 2082 without new increases in taxes or
spending cuts. The report was released on the agency’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
