Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s U.K. unit may
have to pay less than initially thought to buy 318 branches from
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,  Expansion  reported, citing
people familiar with the deal.  The final price would be about 1.5 billion pounds ($2.3
billion) compared with 1.65 billion initially expected in August
2010, Expansion said. The reduction may come after a decline in
net asset value, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
