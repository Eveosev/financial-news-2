Former  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  Chief
Executive Officer  Leo Apotheker , ousted last week after
overseeing a 46 percent drop in the company’s stock price during
his 11-month tenure, will receive a $7.2 million severance.  Apotheker also will get an annual bonus of $2.4 million
under a “Pay-For-Results” company policy started in 2005,
along with accelerated vesting of stock options with another
$3.56 million, according a regulatory filing today from Palo
Alto, California-based Hewlett Packard. Apotheker also is
receiving 424,000 additional “performance-based restricted
stock options” worth $10 million based on today’s stock price.  The company also said newly installed CEO Meg Whitman, 55,
is taking a $1 a year salary, along with a target annual bonus
for 2012 of $2.4 million. She also has the option of purchasing
up to 1.9 million shares, the company said.  Apotheker, 58, was ousted Sept. 22 after cutting sales
forecasts three times and making strategy shifts that blindsided
investors. Whitman, the former  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  CEO and California
gubernatorial candidate, was named chief executive, with venture
capitalist Ray Lane becoming executive chairman.  The company also will pay for Apotheker and his family to
return to France or Belgium, and up to $300,000 for any loss the
former CEO incurs with the sale of his home in California, the
filing said.  Hewlett-Packard rose 2.5 percent to $23.78 in New York
Stock Exchange trading at 4:15 p.m. The shares have risen 4.3
percent since Sept. 22, when the leadership change was made.  To contact the reporter on this story:
