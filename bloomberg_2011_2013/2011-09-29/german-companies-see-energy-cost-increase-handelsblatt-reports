Three of four German middle-sized
companies expect an increase in electricity costs as Germany
phases out nuclear energy,  Handelsblatt  said in a preview of an
article that will be published tomorrow, citing a poll by Forsa.  While most of the 250 companies polled see an increase of
less than 5 percent, some 23 percent forecast an increase of
more than 5 percent, the newspaper reported, citing the poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
