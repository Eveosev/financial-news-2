Russian farmers harvested 86.4
million metric tons of grains and pulses as of yesterday, about
46 percent more than a year earlier, the  Agriculture Ministry 
 said .  The crop was gathered from 85 percent of the planted area,
or 37.3 million hectares (92.1 million acres), the ministry said
on its website.  The wheat crop reached 53.5 million tons after 86 percent
of the sown area was harvested, the ministry said. The barley
harvest was 16.8 million tons from 92 percent of the planted
area.  About 20.7 million tons of grains were collected in the
Southern federal district; 21.2 million tons in the Volga area;
16.4 million tons in the Central federal district; 13.3 million
tons in the Siberian region; and 9 million tons in the North-
Caucasus district, the ministry said.  The oilseeds crop included 2.6 million tons of sunflower
seeds, 534,000 tons of soybeans, and 797,000 tons of rapeseeds,
according to the report.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said on Sept. 27 the grains
crop is expected to reach 90 million tons this year. That will
meet domestic demand and reinstate  Russia  as one of the largest
grain exporters, he said. The government plans to increase
agricultural subsidies to 170 billion rubles ($5.3 billion) in
2012 from 163 billion rubles this year, Putin said.  Russia’s crops were damaged last year by the country’s
worst drought in a half century. The figures for grains and
oilseeds are in bunker weight, which is the weight before drying
and cleaning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
