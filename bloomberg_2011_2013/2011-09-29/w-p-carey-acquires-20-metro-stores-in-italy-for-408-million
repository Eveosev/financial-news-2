W.P. Carey & Co., a specialist in
sale-and-leaseback deals, acquired a fund that owns 20 wholesale
stores in Italy from  Metro AG (MEO)  in a transaction valued at 300
million euros ($408 million).  The purchase includes the assumption of about 180 million
euros of loans secured by the properties and provided by Italian
and French lenders, New York-based W.P. Carey said today in an
e-mailed statement. Metro,  Germany ’s largest retailer, disclosed
the sale in a separate statement.  “What investors are looking for is a cash yield supported
by a long lease to a single user, usually a household name like
Metro,” Cabot Lodge, W.P. Carey’s president and head of
European investments, said in a telephone interview.  The leases for the properties run for about 16 to 18 years,
generating a rental income equivalent to about 8 percent of the
properties’ value, excluding the effect of debt, Lodge said.  The stores, located in northern and central  Italy , were
purchased by W.P. Carey’s CPA:17 - Global fund. BNP Paribas
Real Estate, an arm of the Paris-based bank, will continue to
manage the fund that owns the “cash and carry” stores, while
Metro will retain a small minority stake in the vehicle.  It’s the first acquisition in Italy for W.P. Carey, which
manages about $3.5 billion of real estate outside the U.S. The
company plans to double that figure over the next five years,
Lodge said.  W.P. Carey has done 600 million euros of deals elsewhere in
 Europe  during the past 12 months, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
