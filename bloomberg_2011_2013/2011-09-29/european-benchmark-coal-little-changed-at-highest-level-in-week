Benchmark European coal was little
changed, staying at the highest level in a week.  Thermal coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp with settlement next year was at $123.50 a metric ton as
of 12:25 p.m. in  London . That would be the highest close since
Sept. 22 and a 3.9 percent drop since the begging of the
quarter.  Bloomberg tracks data from information supplied by ICAP
