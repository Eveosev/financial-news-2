The air war to oust Libyan
strongman Muammar Qaddafi has cost the French military 300
million to 350 million euros beyond what was already budgeted
for overseas military operations, the defense ministry said in a
presentation of its 2012 budget. The final cost wonâ€™t be known
until all operations have ceased, it said.  Of the extra money spent so far, about 60 million euros was
for fuel and 100 million for ammunition, with the rest from pay
and maintenance, Hugues Bied-Charreton, finance director of the
ministry, told reporters in Paris.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
