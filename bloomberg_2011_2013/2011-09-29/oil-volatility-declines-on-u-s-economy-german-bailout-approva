Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures gained on news that the  U.S. economy  grew
faster than previously indicated and German lawmakers approved
an expanded European bailout fund.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 46.7 percent at 2:50 p.m. in New
York, down from 48.1 percent yesterday.  Oil for November delivery advanced 93 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $82.14 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Oil has dropped 14 percent since the end of June,
heading for the biggest quarterly loss since 2008. Prices are
down 7.5 percent this month.  The most active options contract in electronic trading
today was November $70 puts, with 4,163 lots changing hands. The
options declined 19 cents to 51 cents a barrel. November $80
puts, the next-most-active options, fell 44 cents to $2.67 on
volume of 2.067. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The volume of puts outnumbered calls 64 percent to 36
percent in electronic trading.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  December $70 puts were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 6,070 changing hands. They rose 61
cents to $2.07 a barrel. The next-most active options, November
$75 puts, gained 66 cents to $1.56 a barrel on volume of 4,943.  Open interest was highest for December $50 puts with 49,501
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 49,308 and
