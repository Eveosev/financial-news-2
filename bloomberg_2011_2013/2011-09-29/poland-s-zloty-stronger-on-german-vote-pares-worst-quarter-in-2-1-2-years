Poland’s zloty strengthened against
the euro, paring its steepest quarterly loss in 2 1/2 year,
after  Germany ’s lower house of parliament approved the expansion
of a bailout fund for debt-stricken euro-area nations to help
contain the sovereign-debt crisis.  The zloty gained 0.3 percent to 4.4273 per euro as of 1:53
p.m. in Warsaw. The Polish currency has weakened 10 percent
since the end of June, poised for the biggest quarterly loss
since the first three months of 2009 and the worst slide among
176 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  won the backing of her
coalition to expand the powers of the European Financial
Stability Facility. The yen weakened as Asian and European
stocks reversed losses, spurring demand for higher-yielding
assets.  “The vote in Germany was a good news,” said  Gaelle Blanchard , an emerging-market strategist at Societe Generale SA
in London. “The mood remains cautious though and people are
holding their breath to see how things are going to develop.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
