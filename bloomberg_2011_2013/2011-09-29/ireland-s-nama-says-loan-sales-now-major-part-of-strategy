Brendan McDonagh, chief executive
officer of the National Asset Management Agency, said loan sales
will form “a major part if our strategy going forward.”  In a speech in Dublin today, he said he’s open to selling
loans related to “individual assets, whole debtor connections
or groups of loans by geography.”  He also said there’s “strong indicative interest from
investors, mainly foreign, in purchasing Irish commercial
property.” While “liquidity remains the key constraint,” the
agency is “is ready to be innovative in monetising its
portfolio with additional initiatives being progressed over the
coming months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
