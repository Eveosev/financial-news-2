India â€™s government is borrowing
more because of a reduction in small savings collections and
dwindling cash surplus, a finance ministry official told
reporters in  New Delhi  today, declining to be identified before
an official announcement.  The government expects a 350 billion rupees shortfall in
collections from small savings funds and the cash surplus at the
beginning of the year was 170 billion rupees less than expected,
the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
