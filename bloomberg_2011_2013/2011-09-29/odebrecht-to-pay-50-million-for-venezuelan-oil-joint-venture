Odebrecht E&P Espana plans to pay
$50 million for a 40 percent stake in a joint venture with state
oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, according to an agreement
approved by the National Assembly and published in the Official
Gazette.  Odebrechtâ€™s Spanish unit will work with the Corporacion
Venezolana de Petroleo, which will have the remaining 60 percent
stake, to extract crude from the Mara Oeste, Este and La Paz
fields in northwestern Zulia state for a period of 25 years,
according to the Gazette. The joint venture will sell all the
oil and gas it produces to PDVSA, the Gazette said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
