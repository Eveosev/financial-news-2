Camargo Correa SA, a Brazilian
holding company, is seeking to sell Jardim Sul mall in  Sao Paulo 
as it plans to raise cash to invest in energy and infrastructure
projects, Valor Economico reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  BR Malls Participacoes SA (BRML3)  is one of the companies
interested in buying Jardim Sul, which may worth 600 million
reais ($325 million) to 700 million reais, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said.  Camargo Correa and BR Malls declined to comment, according
