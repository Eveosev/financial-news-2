(Corrects name of block in second paragraph and type of
fuel in fifth paragraph of story that originally ran Sept. 29.)  Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP)  wants
to sell its stakes in an Algerian project and an energy
concession in Iraq’s Kurdish region, a company official said.  Gulf Keystone is seeking a buyer for the GKS and GKN
oilfields on Block 126a in  Algeria , Legal and Commercial
Director Tony Peart said today. The Hamilton, Bermuda-based
company also aims to sell its 20 percent interest in the Akri
Bijeel block in the semi-autonomous Kurdish area of northern
Iraq, he said.  Kalegran Ltd., a unit of  Hungary ’s Mol Nyrt. is the
operator of the block in the Iraqi region controlled by the
Kurdistan Regional Government, Peart said.  “This is a strategic decision to sell because we want to
focus on larger opportunities in Kurdistan,” he said in an
interview in Istanbul at the  Iraq  2011: Future Energy conference
organized by The Energy Exchange.  “We want to focus on projects with larger oil reserves, as
we have 60 million barrels of oil equivalent in Algeria, and by
contrast, there are reserves of 5 billion barrels of oil in
place in Shaikhan,” a separate concession the company operates
in the Kurdish region, he said.  Gulf Keystone started production tests earlier this year
and is ready to ship about 5,000 barrels a day from Iraq, if the
Kurdistan Regional Government approves, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
