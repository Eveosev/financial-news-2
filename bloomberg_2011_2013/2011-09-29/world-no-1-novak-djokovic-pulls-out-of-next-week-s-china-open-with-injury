Top-ranked Novak Djokovic has
withdrawn from next week’s  China Open  with an injury, the tennis
tournament said.  Djokovic, 24, who successfully defended his  China  Open
title last year, pulled out “due to a health problem” which he
has yet to specify, organizers of the Beijing event said in a
statement on their website.  The Serb won his third Grand Slam title of the season at
the  U.S. Open  on Sept. 12 in New York. Six days later, he was
forced to quit during a Davis Cup semifinals match against
Argentina at home in Belgrade with pain in his back and ribs.  Djokovic is 64-3 this year and has won 10 tournaments, his
most successful season ever. After winning his first Wimbledon
title, he knocked Spain’s  Rafael Nadal  off the No. 1 spot on the
ATP World Tour in July.  Roger Federer , a 16-time major champion, last week pulled
out of the  Shanghai Masters , which starts Oct. 9. The Swiss
cited “nagging injuries” for his absence.  At the U.S. Open, players including Nadal and fourth-ranked
 Andy Murray  of Britain criticized the lengthy tennis calendar
and said they’d call a meeting in Shanghai to discuss scheduling
issues. Tennis has an 11-month season, one of the longest in
professional sports.  Murray told the British Broadcasting Corp. last week a
player strike to force changes was “a possibility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
