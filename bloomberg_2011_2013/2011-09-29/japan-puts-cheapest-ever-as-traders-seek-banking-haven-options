Japanese options are the cheapest
ever compared with U.S. contracts as traders bet the Nikkei-225
Stock Average, which has the smallest financials weighting among
the biggest nations, is a haven as shares fall globally.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, for
three-month contracts on the iShares MSCI Japan Index exchange-
traded fund is 5.69 points lower than the figure for the  SPDR
S&P 500 ETF Trust. (SPY)  That’s an increase from 1.02 points on Aug.
29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap surged to a
record 6.24 points on Sept. 22.  Investors are betting Japanese stocks have less risk after
the Nikkei gained 1.1 percent since March 15, its low point
following the nation’s record earthquake and tsunami. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 9.5 percent during the same
period on concern the European debt crisis will curb global
economic growth. Financial companies, which led declines in the
U.S. gauge since this year’s peak in April, make up more than 13
percent of the S&P 500 and 6.4 percent of Japan’s Nikkei.  “It doesn’t seem like  Japan  is on the radar much for
potential problems,” Sean Heron, who manages options strategies
at Glenmede Trust Co., said in a telephone interview yesterday.
The Philadelphia-based firm oversees $20 billion. “The U.S. is
not out of the woods yet with its problems and Japan’s were
earthquake-related and not ongoing. They’re going to price it
this way until the U.S. calms down or there’s another big event
in  Asia .”  Peak After Quake  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the VIX, has surged 119 percent in 2011, more than Japan’s
Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index, which is up 88 percent.
The VIX rose 11 percent to 42.96 today. It peaked this year at a
two-year high of 48 on Aug. 8. The Nikkei volatility gauge added
0.1 percent to 35.36 today, down from 69.88 on March 15,
following the earthquake. Europe’s VStoxx Index, which measures
the cost of protection against Euro Stoxx 50 Index losses,
gained 5 percent to 46.68.  The Topix index slipped 0.2 percent to 761.17 today. The
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  fell less than 0.1 percent to 8,700.29. For the week,
the gauge gained 1.6 percent amid signs Europe’s policy makers
may resolve the region’s debt-crisis.  U.S. financial stocks are moving in tandem with European
bank stocks, the center of concern about a potential recession,
more than Japanese counterparts. The 30-day correlation
coefficient between the S&P 500 Financials Index and the banking
group in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index has averaged 0.65 in 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The figure for European
banks and Japan’s Topix Banks Index is 0.25. Readings of 1 mean
prices are moving in lockstep.  ‘Relative Calm’  “The Japan index could be a port of relative calm,” Alec Levine, an equity derivatives strategist at Newedge Group SA in
 New York , said in a Sept. 27 telephone interview. The Asian
nation is “less exposed to financial contagion than the S&P or
the Euro Stoxx.”  Japan’s companies wouldn’t be insulated from a recession in
 Europe  because the Asian country is a net exporter and would
feel the effects of slowdowns elsewhere, Daniel Genter, who
oversees about $3.7 billion as president of RNC Genter Capital
Management in  Los Angeles , said in a phone interview yesterday.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said last week
at the annual meeting of the  International Monetary Fund  in
 Washington  that failure to combat the Greek-led turmoil
threatened “cascading default, bank runs and catastrophic
risk.” Growth in the world economy will be slow and downside
risks are “piling up,” IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde 
said at a Sept. 23 meeting in Washington.  Japan ETF  The S&P 500 lost 15 percent from its April 29 high amid
concern Europe can’t contain its sovereign debt crisis and
economic growth worldwide will slow. The  S&P 500 Financials
Index (S5FINL)  fell 25 percent, the most among 10 major groups. In
Europe, the Stoxx 600 Banks Index sank 32 percent.  The Japan ETF, which trades in the U.S., has fallen 7.8
percent since April 29, and is down 11 percent this year. It
tracks  310 companies  including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Honda Motor Co. and  Canon Inc. (7751) , which
have the four largest weightings. They make up 12 percent of the
index.  “The options market is suggesting that Japan may not be so
affected from the crisis in Europe,” Bhavin Patel, an equity-
derivatives strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in
 London , said in a Sept. 27 telephone interview. “It had already
sold off before, so when the crisis came, it wasn’t so
aggressive in terms of a selloff. Hence volatility has remained
subdued relative to the U.S.”  ‘Best Places’  The relative discount for Japan options means that
investors have a cheaper alternative for buying protection
against a plunge in global stocks if a Greek default roils
markets, said Rohit Bhatia, a New York-based options strategist
at Barclays Plc, the top-ranked equity-linked strategies team in
Institutional Investor magazine’s 2010 survey.  “Nikkei really stands up as one of the best places to buy
puts,” Bhatia said in a Sept. 27 telephone interview. “If
things turn really bad, you wouldn’t expect anyone to escape,
and in that sense low volatility means it’s a good hedge if
things take a turn like 2008.”  Three-month implied volatility for the Japan ETF is 28.49,
or 5.69 points below the level for the  S&P 500  fund. Since the
Japanese security began trading in 2005, it has on average been
priced 3.17 points higher than the U.S. fund, with spikes to
16.92 points in October 2008 and 16.65 points in March 2011.  “People are more afraid about what’s going on here and in
Europe than they are in Japan,” said Chicago-based Christopher Rich, head options strategist at JonesTrading Institutional
Services LLC. “The volatility that we’re having on a daily
basis in the U.S. is an indication of the complete
uncertainty.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
