The Slovak government settled a
dispute with a venture of Taisei Corp. and Skanska AB, agreeing
to pay the builders 20 million euros ($27 million),  Hospodarske
Noviny  reported, citing the countryâ€™s highway agency.  The payment relates to the construction of a highway tunnel
in Bratislava, the Slovak capital, in the previous decade, the
newspaper said. Costs of the project have risen to 135 million
euros once the additional payment is included, Hospodarske said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
