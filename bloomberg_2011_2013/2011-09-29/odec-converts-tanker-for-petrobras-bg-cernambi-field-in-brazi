Modec Inc. (6269)  and Schahin Engenharia
SA will convert an oil tanker into an oil-and-gas production
vessel for a Petroleo Brasileiro SA-led project off Brazil.  The partners will refurbish the very large crude carrier
Sunrise J into the floating, production, storage and offloading
vessel Cidade de Mangaratiba MV24. The FPSO will be able to
process 150,000 barrels of oil and 280 million cubic feet of gas
a day, Modec said today in a  statement .  The unit will be delivered to the BM-S-11 block’s  Cernambi
South  area in the Santos Basin in the third quarter of 2014.  BG
Group Plc (BG/)  and  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP)  are partners in the
development.  Last year, Tokyo-based Modec, the world’s second-biggest
builder of FPSOs, and Schahin won a contract to build a
different vessel for Petrobras’s Guara field off  Brazil .  -- Editors: Alex Devine, Randall Hackley  To contact the reporter on this story:
