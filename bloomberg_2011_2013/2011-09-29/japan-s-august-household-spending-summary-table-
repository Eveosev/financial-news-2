fell 0.1 percent in Aug. from the previous month, seasonally
adjusted, the government’s statistics bureau in Tokyo said.  From a year earlier, spending fell 4.1 percent.  NOTE1: Monthly and three-month changes are sesaonally adjusted, yearly
changes are not seasonally adjusted. Three-month percentage changes
are calculated as the three-month average change from the prior three-
month average.

dividing seasonally adjusted living expenditures by seasonally adjusted
disposable income.
