OAO Severstal,  Russia ’s second-
biggest steelmaker, said it will separate its Nord Gold unit,
after shelving a plan for an initial public offering this year.  “Strategically we made a decision to separate gold,”
Chief Executive Officer Alexey Mordashov said today in an
interview in  London . “It has no synergy with steel and steel-
related mining.”  Nord Gold postponed plans for an IPO in London in February,
citing “market conditions.”  Severstal has a “strong intention” to decide on when to
separate the unit this year, Mordashov said, adding that the
timing depends on the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
