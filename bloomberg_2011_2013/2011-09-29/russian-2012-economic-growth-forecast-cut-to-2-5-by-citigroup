Russia ’s economy will expand 2.5
percent in 2012, Citigroup Inc. estimated, lowering its forecast
for the second time this year amid concern a global slowdown and
domestic politics will dent consumer confidence and investment.  The bank in August cut to 3.5 percent its earlier
prediction of 4 percent growth, Citigroup economists Elina Ribakova and Natalia Novikova said in an e-mailed note today
from  London .  “Global financial turbulence and political uncertainty
will weigh on investment and consumer expectations in Russia,”
they wrote. “We hope this will be the end of the revisions, but
the global outlook remains uncertain.”  Russia’s growth prospects are worsening as concern the U.S.
is poised for a new recession and the lack of a solution to
Europe’s debt crisis have roiled financial markets across the
globe, prompting investors to reduce holdings of riskier
emerging-market assets.  The decision by Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  and President
 Dmitry Medvedev  to swap jobs after parliamentary elections in
December and a presidential ballot early next year indicates
limited appetite on the part of Russia’s political elite for
structural changes, Ribakova and Novikova wrote.  The economy will grow 4 percent this year as pre-election
spending spurs consumer demand, according to Citi. Inflation
will average 8 percent this year and about 7 percent in 2012,
Citi forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
