SP Setia Bhd. (SPSB) ,  Malaysia â€™s biggest
listed developer by sales, rose in pre-market trading after
shareholder Permodalan Nasional Bhd. offered 3.90 ringgit a
share in a buyout bid.  The stock was offered at 3.90 ringgit at 8:32 a.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. The shares were suspended yesterday. SP Setia said the
offer by Permodalan, or PNB, undervalues the company and will
seek a competing offer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
