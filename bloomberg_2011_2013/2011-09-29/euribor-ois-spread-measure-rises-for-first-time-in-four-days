A measure of banks’ reluctance to
lend to one another in  Europe  rose for the first time in four
days, according to a money markets indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between three-month
Euribor and overnight index swaps, widened to 81 basis points as
of 4:45 p.m. in London, from 78 yesterday, Bloomberg data show.
The gap reached a 2 1/2-year high of 89 on Sept. 23.  German lawmakers today approved an expansion of the euro-
area rescue fund, freeing the way for European officials to
weigh further measures to bolster  Greece  and keep the sovereign
crisis from spreading. More than a third of participants in a
global survey of Bloomberg subscribers say deteriorating
European debt will derail the world economy over the next year.  “Perceptions of an orderly solution to the European crisis
are wobbling,”  Bill Blain , a strategist at broker Newedge Group
in London, wrote in a note. “There are just too many known and
unknown unknowns to face the day with much confidence.”  The rate banks pay to convert euro payments into dollars,
measured by the three-month cross-currency basis swap was 104
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate, compared
with 100 basis points yesterday. The cost was 112.5 basis points
under Euribor on Sept. 12, when the swap was the most expensive
since December 2008. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap was 68.5 basis
points less than Euribor from 67 yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  ECB Deposits  The ECB said financial institutions increased overnight
deposits. Banks left 173 billion euros ($236 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based lender yesterday, compared with 164 billion
euros Sept. 26 and 197.8 billion euros Sept. 12, the ECB said.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- increased to 1.550 percent from
1.544 percent yesterday. One-week Euribor fell to 1.220 percent
from 1.228 percent.  The three-month dollar  London  interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 15th day to 0.372 percent from 0.369 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 12, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was little
changed at 36.5 basis points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
