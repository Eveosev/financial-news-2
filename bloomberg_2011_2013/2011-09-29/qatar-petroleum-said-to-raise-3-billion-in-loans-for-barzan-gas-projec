Qatar Petroleum , the Gulf country’s
state-run energy company, plans to raise about $3 billion from
project financing next quarter to develop its Barzan natural-gas
facility, two bankers familiar with the transaction said.  The 16-year loans will pay an interest of between 100 basis
points to 150 basis points over benchmark rates besides fees,
said the bankers, who declined to be identified because the
information is private.  Qatar Petroleum  sent out request for
proposals for the loan to about 50 local and foreign banks and
may complete signing documents over the next four to six weeks,
the bankers said. One basis point is one hundredth of a percent.  The loans will be followed by a bond offering, with a total
fund-raising of $5 billion planned, the bankers said.  Qatar Petroleum didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  Qatar Petroleum and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  signed an agreement
in January to develop the Barzan facility. At an estimated cost
of more than $8 billion, it will be the country’s most-expensive
energy project since  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  announced the Pearl
gas-to-liquids plant, now budgeted at about $19 billion, in
2006.  Barzan’s two plants are to produce 1.4 billion cubic feet
of natural gas a day for domestic needs once completed in 2015.
Qatar Petroleum will own 93 percent of the project and Exxon the
remainder, while Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Co., one of
Qatar’s two gas liquefaction companies, will develop it.  To contact the reporters on this story:
