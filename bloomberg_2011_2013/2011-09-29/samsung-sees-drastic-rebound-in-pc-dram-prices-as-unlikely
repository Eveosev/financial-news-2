Samsung Electronics Co., the
world’s largest maker of computer memory chips, doesn’t expect
“a drastic rebound” in prices for DRAM used in personal
computers, Kwon Oh Hyun, head of the company’s chip division,
said in an e-mail in response to queries from Bloomberg News.  The Suwon, South Korea-based company’s chip business is on
track to meet its capital expenditure plan for 2011, Kwon said
in the email forwarded by the company’s public relations staff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
