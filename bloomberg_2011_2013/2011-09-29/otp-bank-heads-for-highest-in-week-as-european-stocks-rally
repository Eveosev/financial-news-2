OTP Bank Nyrt. advanced, heading
for the highest close in a week, as banks led a rally in
European stock markets.  The shares of  Hungary ’s largest lender rose 2.3 percent to
3,326 forint as of 10:58 a.m. in Budapest, the highest on a
closing basis since Sept. 21. That pared OTP’s quarterly slide
to 44 percent. The benchmark BUX index, in which OTP has a 26
percent weighting, strengthened 0.7 percent.  European stocks gained for the fourth time in five days
before a vote in  Germany  on expanding the remit of the euro
region’s rescue fund. Asian shares and U.S. index futures
advanced.  The forint depreciated 0.2 percent to 290.7 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
