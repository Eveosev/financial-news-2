China ’s stocks fell, sending the
benchmark index to a 14-month low, on concern economic growth
will slow as the government maintains measures to curb inflation
and demand for exports falters in  Europe  and the U.S.  Jiangxi Copper Co. and Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. paced
declines by commodity producers after metal prices dropped.
Shanghai Friendship Group Co. and Dashang Group Co. retreated
more than 2 percent among consumer-related stocks after Vice
Premier  Li Keqiang  said the top priority will continue to be
stabilizing prices. Most global investors predict Chinese growth
will slow to less than 5 percent by 2016, a Bloomberg poll
showed.  “The European debt problem will remain hanging over the
market as there’s no possibility of solving it in the near
future,” said  Zhang Ling , general manager at Shanghai River
Fund Management Co. “That’ll continue to bring turmoil to
global financial markets as the appetite for risk assets is
falling.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, dropped 26.72 points, or 1.1 percent,
to 2,365.34, its lowest close since July 5, 2010. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  declined 0.9 percent to 2,588.19.  Trading in  Hong Kong  for the morning session was canceled
because of a typhoon. China’s markets will be closed all next
week for holidays.  Greek Concern  The Shanghai Composite has sunk 14 percent this quarter,
set for the biggest loss since the three months to June 2010,
amid concern  Greece  will default on its debt. The index has
tumbled 16 percent this year as the government raised  interest
rates  and reserve-requirement ratios for banks to cool inflation
that’s at the highest level in almost three years.  The stock measure is valued at 10.9 times estimated profit,
the lowest level on record, according to weekly data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The European Commission is resisting a push to impose
bigger writedowns on bank holdings of Greek sovereign debt than
those previously agreed on, a European official said.  A gauge tracking materials producers on the CSI 300
retreated 2.8 percent, the largest contributor to losses among
the 10 industry groups. Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer
of the metal, slid 2.7 percent to 26.46 yuan. Tongling
Nonferrous Metals Group Co., China’s second-largest copper
producer, lost 2.5 percent to 19.43 yuan. Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd., the listed unit of nation’s biggest maker of the
lightweight metal and also called Chalco, fell 1.5 percent to
8.11 yuan.  Metals, Oil  An index tracking six metals including copper, aluminum and
zinc slumped 3.2 percent yesterday. Crude for November delivery
dropped as much as $1.35 to $79.86 in New York Exchange today
after falling 3.8 percent to $81.21 yesterday.  Fifty-nine percent of respondents to Bloomberg’s poll said
China’s gross domestic product, which rose 9.5 percent last
quarter, will gain less than 5 percent annually by 2016. Twelve
percent see such a slowdown within a year, and 47 percent said
it will occur in two to five years, the quarterly Bloomberg
Global Poll of investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg
subscribers showed.  The global economic situation is ‘complicated’’ and
challenging, and the country is seeking a stable and relatively
fast economic development,  China Central Television  reported
yesterday, citing Vice Premier Li. The government’s top priority
will continue to be stabilizing prices, it said.  Shanghai Friendship lost 2.8 percent to 15.59 yuan. Dashang
Group slid 2.6 percent to 41.12 yuan. Bright Dairy & Food Co.,
the country’s second-largest listed dairy-product maker, fell
4.2 percent to 8.18 yuan.  Power Transfer  China, which saw its exports tumble the most since at least
1979 amid the 2008-2009 global crisis, may not be able to rely
on trade in any prolonged demand slump in Europe and the U.S.,
now battling to avoid returning to a recession. Managing the
economic downshift would fall to the Communist Party’s next
leaders, as President  Hu Jintao  and Premier  Wen Jiabao  begin
their transition from power late next year.  Even so, for many investors, the short-term view remains
positive. Asked to identify the market offering the best returns
over the next 12 months, 23 percent selected China, second only
to the 30 percent who picked the U.S.  Sinohydro Group Ltd. raised 13.5 billion yuan ($2.1
billion) in its initial public offering, China’s biggest this
year, after selling shares at the low end of their indicative
 price range  as the market slumped.  The country’s largest builder of hydroelectric dams sold
the shares at the bottom of a price range of 4.50 yuan to 4.80
yuan, according to a statement filed to the  Shanghai Stock
Exchange  today. The company cut the size of its issuance to 3
billion shares on Sept. 26.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
