The number of Greeks using the
countryâ€™s subsidized public health system has increased by
almost a third since the start of the economic crisis, as fewer
people are able to afford private health care,  Kathimerini 
reported, citing Health Ministry data.  The average number of people using public hospitals each
month between January and August was 189,537, a 30 percent
increase compared with 2009, according to the Athens-based
newspaper. The increase was 8 percent compared with last year,
while the number of people using public hospitals for surgery
increased 6 percent from last year, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
