Russian First Deputy Prime Minister
 Igor Shuvalov  said the government is seeking to get its three-
year budget approved and is working as usual after Finance
Minister Alexei Kudrin was fired on Sept. 26.  “It’s too bad Kudrin isn’t with us, but there are no
unpleasant consequences for the market,” Shuvalov told
reporters today in Novo-Ogaryovo at Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s residence. “The main thing is it’s business as usual.”  Kudrin, who had led the ministry since 2000, was dismissed
by President  Dmitry Medvedev  after publicly criticizing 2.1
trillion rubles ($66 billion) in additional defense spending
through 2014. Medvedev agreed last week to swap places with
Putin after March presidential elections and on Sept. 27 named
Anton Siluanov, Kudrin’s deputy for overseeing inter-budgetary
relations, acting finance minister.  “The main budgetary decisions have already been taken”
and approved by Putin, Shuvalov said. “Don’t expect any
surprises.”  Winning parliamentary approval for the government’s
2012-2014 budget is “the most important question for us right
now,” Shuvalov said. The authorities will provide financial
markets with enough liquidity, he said.  After Kudrin’s departure,  Russia  may reorganize its
participation in international bodies such as the Group of 20
and BRICS countries, Shuvalov said. Kudrin has previously
represented Russia at international events together with central
bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev, he said, adding that the
government is discussing what changes will be made.  To contact the reporter on this story:
