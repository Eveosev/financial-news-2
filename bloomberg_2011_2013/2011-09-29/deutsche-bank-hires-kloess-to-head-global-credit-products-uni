Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s largest
lender, named Susanne Kloess as head of global credit products
for its private and business clients division.  Kloess, formerly a managing director at Accenture’s capital
markets practice, will be responsible for more than 100 billion
euros ($130 billion) of loans at the bank’s consumer division,
according to Michael Lermer, a spokesman for the Frankfurt-based
bank. She will take up the job on Oct. 1.  Deutsche Bank, which acquired consumer lender Deutsche
Postbank AG last year, is seeking to reduce its reliance on
investment banking income. The company wants to double pretax
profit at the private and business clients unit “in the mid-
term” following the Postbank takeover, management board member
Rainer Neske said in September to investors. The division posted
a 1.6 billion-euro profit this year.  The hire “underscores the significance of the credit
business for the growth targets of the private and business
clients division,” Lermer said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
