Magyar Telekom Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s
former phone monopoly controlled by  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , rose
the most in 16 months after the European Commission told Hungary
to end a special tax on the telecommunications sector.  The shares rose as much as 7 percent and gained 4.9 percent
to 495 forint as of the 5 p.m. end of trade in Budapest, the
biggest jump on a closing basis since May 10, 2010 and paring
losses for the quarter to 16 percent. Traders bought and sold
6.7 million Magyar Telekom shares today, more than five times
the three-month average.  The European Commission called on Hungary today to abolish
the tax on telecommunication operators, saying it is illegal
under EU rules as the revenue is used for the government’s
central budget and not for meeting the specific costs of
regulating the industry.  “If the telco tax really ceased to exist, Magyar Telekom
is deeply undervalued,” Attila Gyurcsik, an analyst at Concorde
Securities in Budapest, wrote in a note to clients. “The news
is very positive for Magyar Telekom.”  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s government sees “no reason”
to end the special levy and stands ready to face legal
challenges,  Peter Szijjarto , the prime minister’s spokesman,
said in a statement today in response to the EU request.  “We have to note the high uncertainty regarding the tax
issue,” including on the outcome of a potential court case,
analysts at Erste Group Bank AG including Jozsef Miro in
Budapest wrote in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
