Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR) ,
 South Africa ’s second-largest construction company, more than
doubled Chief Executive Officer Brian Bruce’s fiscal 2011 pay as
he retired and the company had a loss.  Bruce earned 10.2 million rand ($1.3 million) in the
12 months through June, including a base salary of 4.85 million
rand and an additional 4.85 million-rand guaranteed contract
payment, according to the Johannesburg-based company’s  annual
report  posted on its website. Bruce was paid 4.9 million rand a
year earlier.  Former Financial Director Roger Rees received a 52 percent
increase to 7.7 million rand. The builder said Feb. 23 that
both men would retire by the end of June after 11 years in
their posts.  The company, which helped build the Gautrain rapid-rail
that links Johannesburg and  Pretoria , reported a net loss of
1.74 billion rand for the year through June, compared with
profit of 1.1 billion rand a year earlier. It halted dividends,
citing the company’s “liquidity position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
