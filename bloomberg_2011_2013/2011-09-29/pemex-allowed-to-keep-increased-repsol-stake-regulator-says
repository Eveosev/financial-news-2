Spain’s energy regulator said it
won’t investigate Petroleos Mexicanos’ increased stake in  Repsol
YPF SA (REP) , denying a request from the Spanish company’s management.  The watchdog, known as CNE, said its decision to allow
Repsol to keep the stake took into account criteria that had
been followed in similar cases, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  The state-owned Mexican  oil company , known as Pemex,
increased its holding to almost 10 percent this month from 5
percent after agreeing to an alliance with  Sacyr Vallehermoso
SA (SYV) , Repsol’s biggest shareholder with 20 percent.  The decision advances Sacyr and Pemex’s bid to increase
their influence over Repsol and install a chief executive
officer alongside Chairman Antonio Brufau. It will also
strengthen Sacyr’s negotiating position as it works to refinance
a 4.9 billion-euro credit ($6.7 billion) secured against its
Repsol shares that comes due in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
