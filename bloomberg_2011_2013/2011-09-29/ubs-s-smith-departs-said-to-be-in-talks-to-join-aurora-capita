Steven Smith , the head of
restructuring at  UBS AG (UBSN) ’s investment bank, has left the company
and is in talks to join private-equity firm Aurora Capital
Group, according to people familiar with the matter.  Torie von Alt, a spokeswoman for Zurich-based UBS,
confirmed Smith’s departure in an interview. She and a
representative for Aurora declined to comment on Smith’s
negotiations. The people familiar declined to be identified
because the talks with the Los Angeles-based firm are private.  UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank, is in the process of
shrinking its investment bank amid market turmoil that curbed
client activity. Those moves may accelerate following a $2.3
billion loss from unauthorized trading.  Smith spent about a decade at UBS, spearheading
restructuring, leveraged finance and financial sponsors efforts.
He previously worked at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., which
was acquired in 2000 by  Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN)   Aurora was created in 1991 and has about $2 billion in
assets under management between private-equity funds and its
Aurora Resurgence business, which invests in debt securities,
according to its  website .  Aurora Resurgence Fund LP has delivered an average annual
return of 23 percent since its creation in 2007, according to
 data  provided by the  California Public Employees’ Retirement
System , an investor in the fund.  To contact the reporters on this story:
