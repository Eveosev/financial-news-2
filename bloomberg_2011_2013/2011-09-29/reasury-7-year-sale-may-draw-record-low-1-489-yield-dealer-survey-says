The Treasury Department’s
$29 billion sale of seven-year notes may draw a record low
auction yield of 1.489 percent, according to the average
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of nine of the  Federal
Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in September 2018, yielded
1.480 percent in pre-auction trading, which would be the lowest
in Bloomberg data beginning in December 1980. Bids are due by 1
p.m. New York time. The previous record low auction yield was
1.580 percent at the Aug. 25 sale.  The size of the offering is the same as at the past 14
sales of the seven-year maturity after peaking at $32 billion in
auctions from November 2009 through April 2010.  The August offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.76, versus an average of 2.79 for the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 51.7 percent of the notes, the
most at the monthly sales since January.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 7.9 percent of
the notes at the last offering, compared with the 10-auction
average of 8.2 percent.  More than $61.2 billion of maturing seven-year securities
are held by the public and the Fed, including $57.8 billion by
the public and $3.4 billion by the central bank, according to
Treasury data. Today’s sale is a net pay-down of $32.2 billion.  Note Returns  Treasuries maturing in seven years to 10 years have
returned 13 percent this year after gaining 9.3 percent in 2010,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The overall
Treasury market has returned 8.3 percent this year after rising
5.9 percent last year.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  Today’s offering is the third of three auctions of U.S.
notes this week totaling $99 billion. Yesterday’s $35 billion
auction of five-year notes drew a record low yield. The auction
of the same amount of two-year notes on Sept. 27 produced the
highest demand in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
