Billionaire Suleiman Kerimov’s
Anzhi Makhachkala soccer club named Brazil’s former World Cup-
winning defender  Roberto Carlos  as its coach.  Carlos replaces Gadzhi Gadzhiev, the Russian club said on
its website today.  Sponsorship from Kerimov, who built a $7.8 billion fortune
in gold and potash according to Forbes magazine, has allowed the
team to attract stars such as Samuel Eto’o, the record four-time
African Player of the Year who played for Barcelona and  Inter
Milan . Carlos was hired as a player for the team, based in the
southern Russian region of Dagestan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
