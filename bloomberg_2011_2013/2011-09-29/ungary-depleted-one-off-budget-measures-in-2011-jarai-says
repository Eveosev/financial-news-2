Hungary  has “depleted” its
arsenal of one-off budget measures this year, including the levy
of extraordinary industry taxes and the effective
nationalization of private pension funds, said Zsigmond Jarai,
head of the Fiscal Council.  The government needs to cut spending and produce savings
next year to meet budget goals, Jarai told a conference in Pecs,
southern Hungary today.  Jarai heads a three-member Fiscal Council, charged with
reviewing the budget before it’s submitted to Parliament.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
