Russiaâ€™s sugar-beets crop reached
14.1 million metric tons as of yesterday, double the amount a
year earlier, the  Agriculture Ministry   said  on its website.  Beets have been gathered from 30 percent of the sown area,
or 383,000 hectares (946,010 acres), the ministry said. The
yield rose 49 percent to almost 3.7 tons a hectare, according to
the ministry. The crop was 7 million tons on the same date last
year, when Russia suffered its worst drought in a half century,
according to ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
