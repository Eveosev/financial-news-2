Swedish retail sales fell for a
second consecutive month in August, adding to pressure on the
central bank to abandon signaled interest rate increases as the
largest Nordic economic slows.  Sales fell a monthly 0.3 percent after dropping a revised
0.8 percent the previous month, Stockholm-based  Statistics
Sweden  said today. The median estimate of nine economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for no change. Sales rose an annual
0.2 percent, after growing 1.1 percent the previous month.  Swedish  consumer confidence  fell this month to the lowest
since June 2009 as a deepening European debt crisis sapped
optimism in the export-dependent Nordic economy. The government
last month slashed growth forecasts and predicted rising
unemployment in 2012.  Slowing growth prompted the central bank this month to
leave its benchmark repo rate unchanged at 2 percent after seven
increases since July 2010. While the bank cut its forecast for
its rate path, it also signaled it may raise next quarter to
keep inflation in check. The bank forecasts the benchmark rate
averaging 2.1 percent next quarter.  The krona gained 0.2 percent to 9.2093 per euro as of 11:07
a.m. in  Stockholm . Against the dollar, it gained 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
