(Corrects headline to show Frashure will become chairman.)  Acadian Asset Management LLC, a
Boston-based  money manager  that uses quantitative techniques to
invest, said Churchill G. Franklin will become chief executive
officer on Jan. 1, 2013.  Franklin has been with Acadian for 25 years, most recently
as executive vice president overseeing client service, sales,
marketing and technology, the company said today in a statement.
He will replace Ronald D. Frashure, 68, who will become chairman
as Gary L. Bergstrom retires from that role at the end of this
year.  Acadian, which manages $45.7 billion in assets, started its
succession planning 18 months ago, according to the statement.
The firm considered external and internal candidates before
appointing Franklin to lead the company.  Franklin, 61, a graduate of Middlebury College, is on the
investment committee of the Vermont collegeâ€™s $925 million
endowment. Acadian specializes in global strategies, catering
mainly to institutional investors. The firm also manages mutual
funds, including the $828 million Acadian Emerging Markets
Portfolio and the $17.7 million Acadian Emerging Markets Debt
Fund, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
