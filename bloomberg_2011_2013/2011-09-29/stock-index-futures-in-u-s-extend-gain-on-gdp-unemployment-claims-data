U.S. stock futures extended gains
as government data showed jobless claims decreased more than
forecast and gross-domestic product grew more than estimated in
the second quarter, easing concern about an economic slowdown.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in December
rallied 1.1 percent to 1,161.4 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York .  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter, faster than estimated last month and helped by exports
and spending on services.  Applications for jobless benefits dropped by 37,000 in the
week ended Sept. 24 to 391,000, the fewest since April, Labor
Department figures showed. Economists forecast 420,000
claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. An agency official said the data probably reflected a
“slight mistiming” in the seasonal factors used to modify the
figures.  U.S. stocks slid yesterday, halting a three-day rally for
the S&P 500, on concern that European leaders are divided over
how to handle  Greece ’s debt crisis. A four-day rout last week
erased $1 trillion from U.S. equities amid concern Greek
insolvency is inevitable and  Europe  can’t contain the damage.
The decline left the  S&P 500  trading at 12.4 times earnings in
the past 12 months, 4.4 percent below its average valuation at
the lowest point during the last nine bear markets, Bloomberg
data show.  Earlier gains in futures today followed approval by
 Germany ’s lower house of parliament for the expansion of the
European bailout fund, the European Financial Stability
Facility, in Berlin. Lawmakers in the Bundestag voted 523 in
favor of the legislation, while 85 voted against; three
abstained.  The legislation, which raises Germany’s guarantees to 211
billion euros ($287 billion) from 123 billion euros, is set to
be debated and set to a non-binding vote in the upper house, or
Bundesrat, tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
