Gedeon  Richter Nyrt ., Hungary’s
largest drugmaker, asked an Amsterdam court to enforce the
payment of a $40 million compensation Richter was awarded
earlier this year, Chief Executive Officer Erik Bogsch said.   An international arbitration court ordered  Poland ’s Genefar
BV to pay Richter $40 million plus interest in compensation for
the failure of the Hungarian company’s acquisition of Polpharma
SA from Genefar, Richter said on Aug. 9.  The company asked the Amsterdam-based court to enforce the
arbitration court’s ruling and to set a date for the hearing,
Bogsch said in a written answer to Bloomberg News questions
today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
