Ethanol futures gained in  Chicago 
on speculation a 13 percent drop in prices this month will boost
demand for the fuel to be blended into gasoline.  Futures rose for the third time this week amid optimism
that ethanol’s 7.22-cent discount to gasoline will encourage
refiners to use more of the biofuel to take advantage of the
spread between the two while pocketing the 45-cent tax credit
they receive for each gallon of the additive mixed with the
motor fuel. Ethanol traded at a 5.24-cent premium to gasoline as
recently as Sept. 5.  “ We’re kind of building a little bit of support after the
massive sell-off,” said Matt Janney, a broker at Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. “We may have broken the market
to a point where demand comes back in.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery rose 1.3 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.547 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures, down 13 percent in September, are headed for their
largest monthly drop since October 2008 and consecutive
quarterly losses.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.715 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf at $2.605, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago dropped 2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.55 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel increased 1.5
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
