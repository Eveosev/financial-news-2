AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the U.K.’s second-
biggest drugmaker, said it settled a patent lawsuit against
Handa Pharmaceuticals LLC over a generic version of the
antipsychotic medicine Seroquel XR.  The settlement, reached in federal court in Trenton,  New
Jersey , resolves a lawsuit that AstraZeneca filed against Handa,
which sought U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to
launch a copy of the extended-release tablets of Seroquel,
according to a statement by London-based AstraZeneca.  Handa, which won’t dispute that two AstraZeneca patents are
valid and enforceable, will get a license to launch a generic
version in the U.S. on Nov. 1, 2016, or earlier if certain
conditions are met, according to the statement. AstraZeneca’s
patents on Seroquel XR range from March 2012 to November 2017,
according to the statement.  “We believe this agreement reaffirms our intellectual
property rights and is the right business decision for
AstraZeneca at this time,” Chief Executive Officer  David
Brennan  said in the statement. “Seroquel XR remains an
important part of our company’s portfolio benefiting patients
and physicians throughout the world.”  Stephen Cary, the chief operating officer of Fremont,
California-based Handa, said the settlement resolves a case that
was supposed to go to trial on Oct. 3. He declined to comment
further.  AstraZeneca is still pursuing patent lawsuits against other
generic drugmakers over Seroquel XR.  Seroquel accounted for $5.3 billion in worldwide sales last
year, said Stephanie Andrzejewski, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman.  The case is AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP v. Handa
Pharmaceuticals, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Trenton).  To contact the reporter on this story:
