An Egyptian delegation will visit
Ukraine next week to discuss with grain officials and traders
conditions for wheat exports, said Nomani Nomani, vice chairman
of  Egypt ’s state-run General Authority for Supply Commodities.  Egyptian officials will present to Ukrainian government
officials, agricultural unions and exporters the specifications
of wheat cargoes required by the authority, also known as Gasc,
Nomani said in a telephone interview from Cairo today.  “Once they comply with all the specifications, we will be
ready to include Ukraine and other Black Sea countries in our
list of approved sources,” Nomani said.  Egypt has previously dropped Ukraine from its list of
approved wheat suppliers because the imported grain was
unsuitable for making the local bread loaves, Nomani said.
Nomani and other officials will be in Ukraine from Oct. 2 until
Oct. 7.  The authority buys between 5 million to 6 million
metric tons of the grain a year by international tenders
because local production is too low to meet demand in the Arab
world’s most populous nation and wants to diversify its range of
sources. Egypt, with a population of about 80 million
people, uses imported wheat to make subsidized bread.  To contact the reporter on this story:
