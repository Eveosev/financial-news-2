Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  is in a
similar position to Credit Suisse Group AG in relation to a U.S.
investigation of alleged  tax evasion  by clients,
 Tages-Anzeiger  reported, citing unidentified people.  Baer is on a Department of Justice list of Swiss banks
requested to provide data on U.S. clients, according to the
Zurich-based newspaper.  Jan Vonder Muehll, a spokesman for Baer, declined to
comment when called by Bloomberg News.  Credit Suisse said in July that itâ€™s a target of a criminal
investigation by the Department of Justice over former cross-
border private-banking services to U.S. customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
