Reinsurers are expected to
reimburse Australian and  New Zealand  insurers for as much as
two-thirds of damage claims from disasters in 2010 and 2011,
according to Aon Benfield.  Insurers will recoup about A$16 billion ($15.7 billion)
from reinsurers on combined losses of A$25.6 billion from the
floods in Queensland state, Cyclone Yasi, a hailstorm in Perth
and the New Zealand earthquakes, the worldâ€™s biggest reinsurance
broker said in an e-mailed statement.  Executives from reinsurers including Swiss Re and Allianz
Re say prices for catastrophe coverage should rise next year
after disasters from New Zealand to Japan drove up claims and
low interest rates hurt investment returns.  QBE Insurance Group
Ltd. (QBE) , Suncorp Group Ltd. and  Insurance Australia Group Ltd. (IAG) 
spent $3.4 billion buying reinsurance last year to slash
catastrophe bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
