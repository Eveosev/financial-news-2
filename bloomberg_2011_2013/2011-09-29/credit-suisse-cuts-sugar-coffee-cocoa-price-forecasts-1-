Credit Suisse Group AG cut its 3-
month and 12-month price forecasts for raw-sugar, arabica coffee
and cocoa traded on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Sugar will be at 26 cents a pound in three and 12 months,
down from previous forecasts of 32 cents and 33 cents
respectively, the bank said in a report e-mailed today.  “While Brazilian sugar output is expected to disappoint
this season, large crops in India,  Thailand ,  Europe  and Russia
should keep the market sufficiently supplied,” analysts led by
 Tobias Merath  wrote in the report. “The global sugar market is
likely to end the 2011-2012 marketing year with a significant
surplus, limiting price upside.”  Arabica coffee will be $2.20 a pound in three months and $2
in 12 months. That compares with August estimates of $2.85 and
$2.40, the bank said.  “This year, coffee production is likely to come in fairly
high, driven by a solid crop in  Brazil ,” Merath said.
“Colombia’s coffee output is also recovering.”  The three-month cocoa price forecast was reduced to $2,700
a metric ton from $3,000 previously, while the 12-month estimate
was cut to $2,400 from $2,800 in August, the bank said.  “Cocoa prices have been overvalued for nearly four years
now,” it said. “At current levels, the market still looks
expensive, but prices now finally seem to be on the right track
for a more reasonable valuation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
