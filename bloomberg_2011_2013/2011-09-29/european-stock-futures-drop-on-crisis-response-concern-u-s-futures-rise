European stock-index futures
declined amid growing concern that policy makers are divided
over how to handle the region’s debt crisis. Asian shares and
U.S. futures advanced.  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX)  and  STMicroelectronics NV (STM)  may move
after Advanced Micro Devices Inc. cut its forecasts for third-
quarter sales and profitability.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  may fall as Citigroup
advised selling shares of the U.K.’s largest supermarket chain.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in December
lost 0.7 percent to 2,151 as of 7:17 a.m. in  London , while FTSE
100 Index futures also declined 0.7 percent. Contracts on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.7 percent and the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index gained 0.3 percent.  “The European patient is ill and has already had several
different medicines prescribed,” said William De Vijlder, who
oversees $778 billion as the global chief investment officer of
Paris-based  BNP Paribas (BNP)  Investment Partners. “But, to the
patient’s frustration, the doctors don’t seem to be able to
agree on which medicine is the right one and what dose to
prescribe. Fears of a recession are very much alive.”  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index is heading for its worst quarter
since 2008, having fallen 17 percent amid concern global
economic growth is slowing and policy makers are struggling to
contain the European debt crisis. The gauge has lost 0.4 percent
this month following an 11 percent slump in August.  Meltdown, Unrest  Global investors anticipate Europe’s debt crisis leading to
an economic slump, a financial meltdown and social unrest in the
next year, with 72 percent predicting a country abandoning the
euro as a currency within five years, a Bloomberg survey found.  About three-quarters of those questioned this week said the
euro-area economy will fall into recession during the next 12
months and 53 percent said turmoil will worsen in a banking
sector laden with  government bonds , according to the quarterly
Global Poll of 1,031 investors, analysts and traders who are
Bloomberg subscribers. Forty percent see the 17-nation currency
bloc losing at least one member in the next year.  Europe’s woes have reignited as  Greece  attempts to stave
off default and spars with its European Union partners over
whether it deserves the next tranche of aid next month. Euro-
area lawmakers are also taking their time implementing a July
overhaul of their rescue fund to give it more crisis-fighting
tools, while investors question the ability of banks to
withstand further market unrest as signs also mount that the
economy is losing momentum.  German Vote  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will need to gather enough
support today among her coalition for a vote on the region’s
bailout fund, known as the European Financial Stability
Facility. The vote in Berlin on changes to the EFSF would allow
the fund to buy bonds of distressed states and offer emergency
loans to governments. The main opposition  Social Democrats  and
Greens have said they will vote with Merkel’s government.  Italian and Spanish financial market regulators extended
bans on short selling of financial shares that were introduced
last month in a bid to stem market volatility. The Spanish ban
will remain “until the market conditions allow it” to be lifted,
the country’s financial regulator said late yesterday. Italy’s
restriction, and another enacted by  France  in August, will both
last until Nov. 11.  Infineon and STMicroelectronics, Europe’s largest
chipmakers, may move. AMD, the world’s second-biggest maker of
processors for personal computers, said sales in the period
ending Oct. 1 will increase 4 percent to 6 percent from the
previous quarter. That compares with an earlier prediction for
growth of about 10 percent.  Citigroup recommended selling Tesco shares ahead of its
earnings report due Oct. 5, according to a report today.  ING Groep NV (INGA)  may be active as the Financial Times reported
that the Dutch lender may sell its stake in SulAmerica in a deal
that may be valued at $1 billion. ING spokesman Raymond
Vermeulen declined to provide further details in an interview
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
