Medical Protective Co., a
subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , agreed
to buy Princeton Insurance Co. to expand in liability coverage
for health-care providers and in the Northeast U.S.  The acquisition from Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Co.
is expected to add more than 100 employees and be completed
before the end of the year,  Fort Wayne , Indiana-based Medical
Protective said yesterday in a statement. Terms weren’t
disclosed for the all-cash deal.  Medical Liability, a New York-based mutual insurance
company, merged with Princeton in 2000. Princeton serves more
than 13,000 health-care providers including doctors, dentists,
and hospitals and has annual gross-written premiums of about
$140 million, according to the statement. Charles Lefevre will
remain president of the Princeton, New Jersey-based firm.  “We’ve been absolutely delighted with our acquisition of
MedPro in 2005, and look forward to MedPro completing additional
‘add-on’ transactions with companies -- like Princeton -- who
seek the world’s most stable home for their policyholders in a
very unstable and changing health-care liability landscape,”
Berkshire Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Buffett, 81, said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
