India ’s 10-year bond yield climbed
to a two-month high after the government said it will borrow 32
percent more than planned in the second half of the financial
year to make up for dwindling funds.  The benchmark securities completed five quarters of losses
after the finance ministry today said it will sell 2.2 trillion
rupees ($45 billion) of debt in the six months ending March 31,
versus an earlier plan for 1.67 trillion rupees. Fewer
collections in small-savings accounts and less-than-expected
cash surplus forced a higher target, R. Gopalan, secretary,
Department of Economic Affairs, told reporters in  New Delhi .  “This has come as a negative surprise,” said Nirav Dalal,
the Mumbai-based head of debt markets at Yes Bank Ltd.
“Considering the heightened fiscal conditions globally, there
was a sense that the government would maintain their numbers.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent securities due April 2021 rose
10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 8.44 percent, the
biggest increase in two months. There won’t be trading in bonds
tomorrow due to half-yearly closing of banks’ accounts.  Yields have risen 52 basis points, or 0.52 percentage point,
this year and 11 this quarter on concern the fastest inflation
among the so-called BRIC economies will prompt the central bank
to continue its record series of rate increases.  An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products gained 9.13 percent in the week ended Sept. 17 from a
year earlier, the government said today. It rose 8.84 percent
the previous week. Consumer-price gains in the world’s second-
most populous nation remain above the level the central bank
deems acceptable, Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said this week.  The government had earlier budgeted 4.17 trillion rupees of
borrowing in the year to March, 2012, of which it raised 2.5
trillion rupees between April and September.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose 10 basis points to 7.97 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
