The greatest movie scene featuring
a  New York  bar opens with the debonair Nick Charles, played by
William Powell, demonstrating the different rhythms required to
shake the perfect cocktail.  The movie is “The Thin Man,” the scene a New York
speakeasy in the 1920s.  When his wife Nora, the delectable Myrna Loy, enters led by
their dog, Asta, she says, “He’s dragged me into every gin mill
on the block.” Then she orders five martinis to catch up with
her husband.  People really knew how to drink back then, at least in the
movies -- their “gin mill” has 30-foot ceilings and acres of
furled curtains.  Still, New York boasts the greatest selection of bars in
the world, so let us follow in the footsteps of Nick and Nora
and listen to the rhythm of the cocktail shaker in a few of my
favorite spots.  Flirtation Friendly  Flute Midtown positively simmers with the sweet air of
seduction.  This former speakeasy boasts a low ceiling, dim lighting,
Oriental carpets, plus velvet loveseats set so deeply into
recessed booths they positively invite public displays of
affection.  Oh, and don’t forget the 25 champagnes by the glass.  At 205 W. 54th St. Information: +1-212.265.5169;

of them on tap, including some rare Belgian and English
offerings, you don’t need to provide much in the way of
amenities.  And The Half Pint gets by very nicely with bare wood floors
and scrubbed pine tables, thankfully dispensing with the ersatz
stein-and-bratwurst affectations of certain Teutonic
bierkellers. You know the ones I mean.  At 76 W. 3rd St. at Thompson. Information: +1-212-260-1088;
 http://www.thehalfpint.com .  High Culture Bar  With Central Park and the classic New York skyline all
around you, nothing beats the bar sitting atop the  Metropolitan
Museum  of Art for sheer gorgeousness.  The view’s the thing, and more than makes up for cocktails
in plastic glasses. Catch the Monets and mummies on the way up,
and then savor a Met Martini from your perch above it all.  Open until the end of October, 1000 Fifth Ave. at 82 St.
Information: +1-212-535-7710;  http://www.metmuseum.org .  WASPs and Wingtips  At Bemelmans Bar martinis are effectively two-for-one,
making this venerable Upper East Side institution greatly
beloved by the Brooks Brothers set.  As you sip on your perfect Thin Man concoction, the second
half waits in a mini-carafe nestled in crushed ice.  Your next
see-through is ready and waiting, chilled and undiluted, just
when you’re ready for it.  Such thoughtfulness does not go unappreciated by the
neighborhood’s WASP regulars.  In the Carlyle Hotel, 35 E. 76th St. Information: +1-212-
744-1600;  http://www.thecarlyle.com .  Downtown Scene  Despite the name, Death & Company has a mellow, friendly
buzz. There’s no trace of the pretentious posturing that
pervades so many bars staffed by mixologists rather than
bartenders.  This cozy Lower East Side boite specializes in original
cocktails -- the Flor de Jerez is my favorite -- served in silly
little bowl-shaped glasses that would make Nick and Nora feel
right at home.  At 433 E. 6th St. between 1st Ave. and Ave. A. Information:
+1-212-388-0882;  http://deathandcompany.com .  Smoke Signals  Admittedly, the competition’s not very stiff given New
York’s tough smoking regulations, but Club Macanudo is the best
of the few surviving cigar-friendly joints in the city.  It’s leathery and masculine, with a selection of 250 cigars
and polished service, and as a bonus the place also boasts a
“state-of-the-art ventilation system.”  At 26 E. 63rd St. between Park and Madison avenues.
Information: +1-212-752-8200;  http://www.clubmacanudo.com .  Palate Pleasers  Morrell Wine Bar & Cafe offers the city’s best selection of
high-end vintages by the glass.  Recent highlights included a Chateau Pichon-Longueville
Baron 2005, a Ramey Chardonnay 2008 and a Brunello Valdicava
2006.  There’s plenty of eminently potable vino in the $9-$14
range, and the food is outstanding too, especially for lunch or
a light supper.  At 1 Rockefeller Plaza, 49th St. between 5th & 6th avenues.
Information: +1-212-262-7700;  http://morrellwinebar.com .  Post-Work Hidden Gem  With its dim lights, long communal tables and superb
cocktails, the Bar Downstairs at the Andaz Hotel stands out from
the hospitality crowd.  Knowledgeable, friendly bartenders specialize in shaking
and stirring to creative perfection, with no big ego displays.  It may be in a Hyatt, but this is the most un-hotel-bar-
like hotel bar I have ever had the pleasure of drinking in.  At 485 5th Ave. at 41st St. Information: +1-212-601-1234;
 http://newyork.5thavenue.andaz.hyatt.com .  Resurrected Legend  Famed in the 1940s as a glitterati hangout, where  Tennessee Williams  held court and Tallulah Bankhead held men in the palm
of her hand, the Monkey Bar had faded to just another dreary
midtown watering hole.  A recent makeover has restored the famed Ed Sorel mural --
on one wall a youthful Horowitz plays the piano next to a fur-
coated  Babe Ruth  as monkey paparazzi record it all.  The buzzy power-scene excitement is also back.  At 60 East 54th St. Information: +1-212-288-1010;
