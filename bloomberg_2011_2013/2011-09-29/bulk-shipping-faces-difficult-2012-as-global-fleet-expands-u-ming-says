U-Ming Marine Transport Corp. (2606) , the
Taiwanese operator of dry-bulk ships, expects 2012 to be a
“difficult year” for the market because of the launch of more
large ships and higher  iron-ore  production in  China .  “Next year there will be another wave of big ships coming
in,” President C.K. Ong said yesterday in Singapore. It is
“going to be a difficult year.”  Capesize vessels are already headed for their worst year in
more than a decade in 2011 as expansion in the global fleet
outpaces Chinese demand for commodity shipments. Iron-ore prices
that have doubled since the end of 2008 are also prompting
Chinese investment in local mines, paring the country’s reliance
on imports.  “We have a pretty tough market ahead of us,” said Dale Ploughman, chief executive officer of Athens-based dry-bulk
operator  Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp. (SHIP)   About 46.4 million deadweight tons of capesize ships,
enough to carry more than 100,000 tons of commodities, are
expected to be delivered in 2012, according to  Clarkson Plc , the
world’s largest shipbroker. That’s a 47 percent increase from a
projected 31.6 million tons this year, it said.  A total of 232 bulk carriers, equivalent to 17.6 million
tons, were ordered in the first eight months of this year,
Clarkson data showed. The tally includes 29 capesize ships.
Capesize rates have averaged $11,165 a day this year, based on
data from the London-based Baltic Exchange.  China, the world’s biggest buyer of iron ore, imported
447.57 million tons of the material in the first eight months,
11 percent more than a year earlier, the General Customs office
said on Sept. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
