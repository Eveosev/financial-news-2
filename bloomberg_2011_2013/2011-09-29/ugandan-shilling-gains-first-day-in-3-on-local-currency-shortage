Uganda ’s shilling climbed for the
first time in three days against the dollar as companies stayed
out of the market because of a shortage of shillings.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy gained
as much as 0.5 percent to 2,841.2 per dollar and traded up 0.2
percent at 2,850.50 by 3:13 p.m. in the capital, Kampala,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There was little demand of the dollar today as people
don’t have liquidity,” Abbey Mutabali, a currency trader at
Centenary Bank Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. “Banks are
tight and some have been selling dollars to get the shilling.”  Uganda’s shilling reached 2,897.50 against the dollar on
Sept. 23, the weakest since June 1993, as inflation increased
and on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will weaken riskier assets
further. The currency slipped 19 percent this year to the
dollar, making it the second-worst performer after  Kenya ’s
shilling.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to an 18-
year high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8 percent in July,
the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
