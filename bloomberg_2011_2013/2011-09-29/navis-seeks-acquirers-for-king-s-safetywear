Navis Capital Partners , a Malaysian
buyout firm, is seeking buyers for Singapore shoemaker King’s
Safetywear Ltd., four people with knowledge of the matter said.  The fund is in talks about a sale that may value King’s
Safetywear at $300 million to $500 million, the people said,
asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.
They declined to provide names of possible acquirers. A deal may
be completed by year-end, one person said.  Navis Capital took the maker of industrial safety footwear
private in December 2008 for about S$100 million ($77 million),
according to the fund’s website. King’s Safetywear raised S$17.4
million in a 2003 initial public offering that valued the
company at S$68.1 million.  Singapore-based King’s Safetywear markets its products
under the King’s, Otter and Oliver brands, according to its
website. The firm, led by Chief Executive Officer Alex Teo, was
established in 1965 and has manufacturing facilities in
Indonesia, Portugal and  Australia .  An executive at Navis Capital, who asked not to be
identified citing company policy, declined to comment on the
sale in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
