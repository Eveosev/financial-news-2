Canada  introduced changes to its
copyright law that would give rights-holders more control over
how works are distributed online, and allow companies such as
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to impose “digital locks” on protected material
offered on devices like the iPad.  The bill is the latest attempt by the Canadian government
to modernize Canada’s Copyright Act, which last underwent major
changes in 1997.  Under the legislation, copyright owners will have exclusive
control over how works are made available on the Internet.
Owners will be able to apply “technological protection
measures,” commonly known as digital locks, to prevent
unauthorized access of copyrighted material.  “Canadians will soon have modern copyright laws that
protect and help create jobs, promote innovation, and attract
new investment to Canada,” Industry Minister Christian Paradis
said in a  statement . “We are confident that this bill will make
Canada’s copyright laws forward-looking and responsive in this
fast-paced digital world.”  The proposed law will implement treaties, signed by Canada
in 1997, that establish rights and protections recommended by
the World Intellectual Property  Organization .  The legislation is similar to earlier versions introduced
by the governing Conservatives that were blocked by opposition
parties. The bill may pass this time after Prime Minister
 Stephen Harper ’s Conservatives won a majority of seats in the
House of Commons in the May 2 general election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
