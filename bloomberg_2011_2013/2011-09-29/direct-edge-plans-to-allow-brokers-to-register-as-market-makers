Brokers will be able to register as
market makers on two  stock exchanges  operated by Direct Edge
Holdings LLC around mid-October, according to the company.  They can begin functioning as market makers on EDGA
Exchange and EDGX Exchange in November or December, Direct Edge
said in a  notice . The Securities and Exchange Commission must
approve the request to institute a program for market makers
before it goes into effect.  Most exchanges have registered market makers providing bids
to buy shares and offers to sell on their venues. Other firms
not registered as market makers can also supply quotes. Direct
Edge hasnâ€™t offered a market-maker program in the past.  To contact the reporter on this story:
