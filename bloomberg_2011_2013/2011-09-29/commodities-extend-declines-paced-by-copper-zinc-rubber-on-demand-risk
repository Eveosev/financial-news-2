Commodities extended their decline
on concern  Europe â€™s sovereign-debt crisis will hurt global
growth and reduce demand for industrial raw materials.  Copper for three-month delivery fell as much as 5.9 percent
to $6,821 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded
at $6,900 a ton at 9:03 a.m. Singapore time. Zinc shed 4.7
percent and rubber in  Tokyo  fell 4.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
