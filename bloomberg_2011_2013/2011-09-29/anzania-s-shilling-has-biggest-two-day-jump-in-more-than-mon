Tanzania’s shilling rose against
the dollar, heading for its biggest two-day increase in more
than a month as the central bank sold the U.S. currency.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy
strengthened as much as 1 percent to 1,649.5 per dollar and
traded up 0.3 percent at 1,660.5 by 3:09 p.m. in Dar es Salaam,
the commercial capital. The currency has increased 1.5 percent
in the last two days, heading for the largest two-day rally
since Aug. 2. The shilling has depreciated 2.5 percent this
quarter, a third of declines.  “The central bank came in and supplied dollars,” Yonoh
Mtengule, chief economist at National Bank of Commerce Ltd.,
Absa Group Ltd.’s local unit, said by phone from Dar es Salaam.
“Banks have been selling dollars since yesterday after buying
dollars earlier this week as the shilling fell” to 1,685 per
dollar on Sept. 27, the weakest since 1994, when Bloomberg
started compiling the data. The dollar purchases “had no
fundamentals to support them, they were out of panic,” Mtengule
said.  Joseph Masawe, director of economic research and policy at
the Bank of Tanzania, who Bloomberg was referred to for comment
by an official who answered a call to the phone in the
governor’s office, was not available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
