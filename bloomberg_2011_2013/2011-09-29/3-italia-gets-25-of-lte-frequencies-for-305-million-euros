3 Italia SpA said it got 25 percent
of the frequencies for the fourth-generation wireless services
based on so-called long-term evolution, or LTE, technology
auctioned by the Italian government.  3 Italia is paying 305 million euros for the bands,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  “The frequencies we acquired are completely adequate for
the rollout of the LTE infrastructure and to support the data
traffic volumes that will be needed by the market for many years
to come,” Chief Executive Officer Vincenzo Novari said in the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
