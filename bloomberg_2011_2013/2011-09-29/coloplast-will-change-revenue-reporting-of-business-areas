Coloplast A/S said it will start
reporting revenue growth for the business areas Urology
and Continence Care separately and no longer as one business
area.  The change is being implemented in order to show the
development in the companyâ€™s Chronic Care business, Coloplast
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
