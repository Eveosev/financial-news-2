The slowing economy in western
 Europe  won’t affect output at  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ’s Slovak factory
as demand for its models remains strong, the unit’s Chief
Executive Officer Chung Myung-Chul said.  The South Korean carmaker’s Slovak factory is benefiting
from rising demand for cee’d and Sportage models, both of which
are produced in the eastern European country, Chung told
journalists today at a press conference in Zilina, northern
 Slovakia . The company maintains its target of assembling as many
as 250,000 cars this year and 350,000 engines, he said.  Carmakers are facing uncertainty as the sovereign debt
crisis is causing the euro-region’s economy slow. The  European
Central Bank  lowered the 2011 growth forecast for the region to
1.6 percent from 1.9 percent. Kia’s sales in the Europe jumped
25 percent in August from the same month last year, triple the
7.8 percent increase for all carmakers.  The Slovak unit, which started production in 2006, will add
a third shift in the first quarter to meet rising demand,
expecting to hire about 1,000 people.  The company today officially started operations at a second
engine plant in Zilina, which will supply the Czech factory of
Kia’s affiliate,  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , boosting annual engine
capacity to 450,000 units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
