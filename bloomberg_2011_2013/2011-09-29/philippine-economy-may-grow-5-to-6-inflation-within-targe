The Philippine economy may grow
between 5 percent and 6 percent this year, while inflation will
likely be within target, according to a document to be presented
at the government’s economic briefing tomorrow.  Economic growth may be between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent
in 2012, according to the document provided by the government’s
Investor Relations Office. Capital inflows and the debt crisis
in  Europe  are risks to economic growth, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
