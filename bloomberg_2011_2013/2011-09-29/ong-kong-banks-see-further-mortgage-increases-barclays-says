Hong Kong banks expect to continue
raising  mortgage rates  for the rest of this year, signaling the
market won’t be rescued by cheap debt as occurred in 2008,
 Barclays Capital  said.  “Rising funding costs for banks mean high mortgage rates
for borrowers,”  Andrew Lawrence , an analyst at Barclays, wrote
in a report dated yesterday. Since June, banks have increased
time deposit rates by 23 basis points for 3-month deposits and
57 basis points for 6-month deposits, he wrote.  “With mortgage payments now accounting for 47 percent of
household incomes and likely to pass through the 50 percent
lending threshold with the next 50 basis points rise in rates,
affordability is clearly deteriorating,” he wrote. The
“prospect of a repeat of the 2008 shallow and mild cycle for
property prices is looking increasingly unlikely: Cheap and
available debt isn’t going to rescue property prices this time
around.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
