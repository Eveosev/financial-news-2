The Portuguese government today
approved a decree on the planned sale of its stakes in utility
EDP-Energias de Portugal SA and in energy grid operator REN-
Redes Energeticas Nacionais SA.  The sale of the stakes “will be essentially carried out
through direct sales, without ruling out the possibility of
using other mechanisms such as public offerings,” the
government said in a statement handed to reporters after the
weekly cabinet meeting.  The government has said it plans to sell its stakes in EDP
and REN this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
