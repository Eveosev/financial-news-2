Notore Chemical Industries Ltd.  of
 Nigeria , a producer of fertilizer, plans to raise at least $300
million “sometime next year” in an initial public offering to
finance its expansion, an official said.  The company will use the funds raised from its listing on
the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  to build a second production plant
at its factory at Onne in southern Nigeria, Ikponmwosa
Izedonmwen, the company’s head of corporate finance, said in an
interview in Lagos, the commercial capital, on Sept. 27.  Notore began production on Jan. 7, 2009, after it bought
and upgraded the plant of state-owned National Fertilizer Co. of
Nigeria. The plant has the capacity to produce 350,000 metric
tons of ammonia a year, 500,000 tons of urea and 650,000 tons of
a “bulk blend” of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, or NPK
fertilizer, according to the company’s website.  It has an agreement with India’s  Tata Chemicals Ltd. (TTCH)  for
technical advisory services, the company said on April 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
