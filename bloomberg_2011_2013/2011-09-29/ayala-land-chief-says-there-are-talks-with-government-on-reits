Ayala Land Inc. (ALI)  President Antonino
Aquino said “there are discussions we’re having” with
government on real estate investment trusts.  “Private sector is always willing to dialogue so we can
get this thing implemented and moving as soon as possible,”
Aquino said in a forum in  Manila  today. Aquino said he expects
“some tension” given government’s tax drive and the “required
incentives” under the REITs.   To contact the reporter on this story:
