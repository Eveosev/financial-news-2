Canada ’s dollar gained as stocks
and commodities such as crude oil advanced as optimism European
leaders will contain the debt crisis spurred demand for higher-
yielding assets.  The loonie, as the currency is also known, was still headed
for its first quarterly drop against its U.S. counterpart since
the three months ended in June 2010 on concern a deepening
global slowdown will reduce demand for raw materials. The
 Australia  and New Zealand dollars, also related to commodities,
have fallen since June 30.  “If there’s any gauge that commodity currencies are going
to get guidance from, it will certainly be U.S. equities,” said
 Alan Ruskin , global head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG, by phone today from  New York .
“There’s concern all over the world. In this environment, I’d
be more inclined to sell commodity-currency upticks, then buy
the downside.”  The Canadian currency appreciated 0.7 percent to C$1.0268
per  U.S. dollar  at 9:16 a.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0335
yesterday. It touched C$1.0386 on Sept. 26, the weakest level in
more than a year. One Canadian dollar buys 97.39 U.S. cents.  Level Time  “It feels early,” to buy the Canadian dollar at current
levels, Deutsche Bank’s Ruskin said. “Between C$1.0668 and
C$1.08. That seems to me to be very good levels to get in
generally.” He said it’s “reasonable” to think the currency
may weaken to those levels by year-end.  Canada’s government bonds were little changed. Yield on
benchmark 10-year debt rose 1 basis point to 2.21 percent as the
price of the 3.25 percent securities fell 10 cents to C$109.04.
Yields touched record lows of 1.994 percent on Sept. 23.
Canadian  government securities  have returned 5.4 percent this
quarter and 7.2 percent this year, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.4
percent. Futures on crude oil added 1.6 percent to $82.48 a
barrel in New York.  Commodity currencies got a boost after German lawmakers
approved a strengthening of the euro-area rescue fund, clearing
the way for European officials to focus on which next steps may
be needed to stem the debt crisis.  The Canadian dollar was headed for a 6 percent drop against
the dollar in the third quarter and a 5.2 percent decrease in
September.  U.S. Economy  The loonie pared those losses today after a report showed
the American economy grew faster than earlier estimated and
jobless claims declined.  The  U.S. economy  expanded at a 1.3 percent pace in the
second quarter, and applications for jobless benefits dropped by
37,000 in the week ended Sept. 24 to 391,000, the fewest since
April, according to government data.  Canadian factory-product prices unexpectedly rose in August
as a weaker dollar boosted the domestic value of exported
automobiles, government figures showed. Manufacturers’ raw-
material costs fell for a fourth consecutive month.  The industrial product price index rose 0.5 percent in
August from July, Ottawa-based Statistics Canada said today.
Vehicle and other transportation equipment prices rose 1.7
percent, with the prices received for exports boosted by the
currency’s 2.8 percent decline. The industrial-price index would
have fallen 0.2 percent excluding the impact of the dollar.  The raw-materials price index fell 3.2 percent as crude oil
fell 7.5 percent on concern that global economic growth was
slowing,  Statistics Canada  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
