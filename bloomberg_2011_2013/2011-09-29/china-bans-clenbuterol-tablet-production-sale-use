China  banned the production, sale
and use of clenbuterol hydrochloride tablets in the country,
according to a statement posted on the State Food and Drug
Administrationâ€™s website today.  The administration views the tablets as having greater risk
in its use, including side effects and abuse, than its benefits,
according to the statement. The tablets are mainly used for
bronchial asthma treatments, the statement said.  Clenbuterol has been found to be fed illegally to pigs to
induce the growth of lean meat.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
