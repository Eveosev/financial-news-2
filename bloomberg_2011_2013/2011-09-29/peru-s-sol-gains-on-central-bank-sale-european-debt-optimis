Peru’s sol advanced for the second
day this week after the central bank sold dollars and as local
investors speculated European policy makers will tame the euro
zone’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.7685 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:54 a.m. New York time, from 2.7715 yesterday.  The Andean country’s central bank has sold $434 million in
the  spot market  in the past week, including $27 million
yesterday, after concern Europe’s debt troubles may worsen
pushed the sol to a three-month low on Sept. 22. The euro
strengthened and Greek bonds surged today after German lawmakers
backed the expansion of a European bailout fund.  Increased demand for soles locally is offsetting reduced
demand from investors overseas, said Gonzalo Navarro, the head
trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima.  “The fact that we have a central bank selling dollars,
positive stock markets and a strengthening euro is spurring
demand for soles,” Navarro said. “There’s a bit more
confidence the market can bounce back.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.86 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
