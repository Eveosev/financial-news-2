Rubber tumbled to a 13-month low,
heading for the worst quarterly loss since 2008, as concern grew
that  Europe ’s debt crisis may deepen, sending global economies
into a recession and damping raw-material demand.  March-delivery rubber plunged as much as 6.5 percent to
289.5 yen a kilogram ($3,783 a metric ton) before trading at
298.1 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:46 a.m. The
most-active contract has lost 18 percent this quarter, set for
the worst performance since the three months ended Dec. 31, 2008.  Asian stocks extended a global sell-off amid concern that
divisions among European leaders will hamper efforts to solve
the region’s debt crisis.  Japan ’s currency climbed against most
of its peers as demand for a haven increased, cutting the appeal
of yen-based futures.  “The market is vulnerable to selling amid concern the
European crisis will drag global economies into recession,” Ken
Kajisa, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co., said today by phone.  Fifty-nine percent of respondents to a quarterly Bloomberg
Global Poll of investors, analysts and traders said  China ’s
gross domestic product, which rose 9.5 percent last quarter,
will gain less than 5 percent annually by 2016. Twelve percent
see such a slowdown within a year, and 47 percent said it will
occur in two to five years, the poll showed.  The European Commission is resisting a push to impose
bigger writedowns on banks’ holdings of Greek government debt
than those agreed at a July 21 summit, an official said on
condition of anonymity because the deliberations are private.  “It’s all about Europe,” saidKenichi Hirano, general
manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“The focus is if they can establish a unity, and the market’s
going through ups and downs according to developments.”  In  Shanghai , January-delivery rubber lost as much as 5.6
percent to 26,010 yuan ($4,066) a ton before trading at 26,520
yuan.  The cash price of Thai rubber dropped 1.1 percent 132.60
baht ($4.25) a kilogram yesterday, the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand  said on its website. Rains spread across 80 percent
of the Thai south, disrupting tapping, according to the group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
