OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , Romania’s biggest
oil company, said it’s not in talks with  Serbia ’s Naftna
Industrija Srbije over the possible sale of part of its gas
station network, rejecting a newspaper report today.  “Petrom denies the information published by Ziarul
Financiar regarding a potential transaction for the selling of
139 filling stations to the oil company NIS,” the Bucharest-
based company said in an e-mailed statement. “The company
evaluates constantly the performance of its own filling stations
network in order to optimize it.”  Ziarul Financiar said that NIS, which is majority-owned by
 Russia ’s OAO Gazprom Neft, was seeking to buy a quarter of
Petrom’s 550 gas stations and had started due diligence. The
potential transaction might be worth 100 million euros ($136
million), Ziarul Financiar said, citing unidentified people.  “NIS and OMV Petrom are not currently negotiating about a
takeover of a part” of the network in  Romania , NIS spokeswoman
Sanja Lubardic said by e-mail, adding that the companies
“closely cooperate in exchanging experience and in mutual
consultation, but a possible purchase of the gas stations has
not been mentioned.”  “Romania is among priorities for NIS businesses, for
production projects as well as for development of retail,” NIS
said.  OMV, which owns 51 percent in Petrom, announced last week
that it plans to sell 1 billion euros of refining and marketing
assets by 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
