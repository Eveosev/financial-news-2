Even with an influx of Hispanics,
the number of white people in the U.S. fell in 2010 to fewer
than three of every four Americans, the census bureau said.  There were 231,040,398  whites  in 2010, or 74.8 percent of
the nation’s population, a number that includes Hispanics who
identified themselves as white. There were 216,930,975 whites in
2000, 77.1 percent of the population.  The U.S. Census Bureau doesn’t count Hispanics as a
separate race. People who fill out their decennial forms can
either be Hispanic or non-Hispanic, and one or all of six
individual races. Hispanics made up 69.7 percent of  population
growth  among whites, the bureau said.  “The growth of the white population was fueled by
Hispanics who identified as white,” Bradford Hepler, a survey
statistician with the bureau’s racial statistics branch, said in
a telephone call with reporters.  The number of blacks rose to 42,020,743 in 2010, up to 13.6
percent of the population. There were 36,419,434 blacks in 2000,
12.9 percent of the population.  Big cities with the greatest proportions of blacks included
 Detroit , with 84.3 percent of the population; Jackson,
Mississippi, with 80.1 percent; Miami Gardens,  Florida , with
77.9 percent; Birmingham, Alabama, with 74 percent; and
Baltimore, Maryland, with 65.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
