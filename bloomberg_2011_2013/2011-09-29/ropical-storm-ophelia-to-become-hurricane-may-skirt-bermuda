Tropical Storm Ophelia may grow
into a hurricane tomorrow and skirt Bermuda the following day en
route to Newfoundland, the National Hurricane Center said.  Its 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour winds are predicted
to intensify to hurricane-force, at least 74 mph, the NHC said
in a 5 a.m. Miami time advisory. Ophelia was about 180 miles
northeast of the Virgin Islands, heading northward at 7 mph.  Tropical Storm Philippe, in the mid-Atlantic with winds of
45 mph, is forecast to strengthen before weakening again to a
depression by Oct. 3 without threatening land, the center said.  In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Hilary lost strength and is
forecast to weaken to a depression today and remain out at sea
off western  Mexico . The system has 60 mph winds, down from 70
mph yesterday. High surf affecting  Baja California  is expected
to subside over the next day, the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
