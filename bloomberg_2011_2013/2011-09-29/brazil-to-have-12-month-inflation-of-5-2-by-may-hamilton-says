Brazil ’s central bank projects that
12-month inflation will be at 5.2 percent by May, Carlos
Hamilton, the bank’s director of economic policy, said.  “Moderate” cuts in the benchmark Selic rate are
compatible with inflation moving to the 4.5 percent center of
the bank’s target range next year, Hamilton said to reporters in
Brasilia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
