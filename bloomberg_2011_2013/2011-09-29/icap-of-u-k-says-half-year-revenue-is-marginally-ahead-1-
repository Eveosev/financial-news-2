ICAP Plc (IAP) , the biggest broker of
transactions between banks, said it expects revenue in the six
months ending Sept. 30 will be “marginally ahead’ of the year-
earlier period amid market volatility.  Full-year earnings are likely to be “broadly in line”
with its view in July, the London-based company said today in a
statement. Analyst estimates for pretax profit at the time
ranged from 366 million pounds ($572 million) to 402 million
pounds.  “Due to continuing political and economic uncertainty, we
expect the recent high levels of volatility in financial markets
to continue for the rest of the year,” said Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Spencer  in the statement. “The diversity of our
products and services will continue to assist our customers
around the world to do business and reduce risk.”  Interdealer brokers such as ICAP act as a go-between for
banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies, energy and
derivatives. They profit when prices fluctuate because more
traders use the products they trade.  ICAP said it has seen higher volumes on its pure electronic
platforms, including $407 billion traded on is EBS foreign
exchange operation on Aug. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
