Sevan Marine ASA (SEVAN) , the Norwegian
maker of floating oil-production and storage vessels, has
approved a long-term solution presented to the company to stave
off bankruptcy.  The solution will include sustainable collaboration with a
“large industrial partner,” the company said in the statement.
“The board believes it has found a good solution for all
parties. The company will publish further information once the
agreement has been approved by all parties.”  The company requested the Oslo Stock Exchange extend a
suspension of its shares as it meets with stakeholders for a
negotiated settlement that may include a complete restructuring
of bond loans, the company said earlier today in a statement.  “There have been tense moments over the last 24 hours,”
Chairman Jens Ulltveit-Moe said by phone on his way to today’s
board meeting. “It could be very helpful for the company to
have a long-term industrial owner as opposed to straight
financial ones.”  The company has struggled with larger-than-expected
maintenance costs on its Sevan Voyageur production and storage
vessel, which are expected to reach $190 million, compared with
an earlier $135 million forecast.  The company reached an agreement with bondholders in July
to defer interest payments until the end of September as it
negotiates a debt restructuring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
