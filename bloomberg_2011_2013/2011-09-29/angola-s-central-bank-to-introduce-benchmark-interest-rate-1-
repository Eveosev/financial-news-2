The central bank of  Angola , sub-
Saharan Africa’s second-biggest oil producer, plans to introduce
a benchmark interest rate in October, central bank Governor Jose de Lima Massano said.  A monetary policy committee, formed in August, will meet
monthly to decide on the level of the rate, Massano told
reporters in the capital, Luanda, today. Commercial banks have
previously used domestic-bond yields and other financial
instruments to set lending rates, he said. Massano didn’t give a
date for the first meeting.  The committee will help to “preserve the value of the
national currency and the stability of prices in the economy,”
he said.  The southern African nation is improving financial
management after securing a loan from the  International Monetary
Fund  in 2009.  Standard & Poor’s  raised its credit rating for
Angola by one level to BB- on July 12. The central bank, known
as the Banco Nacional de Angola, will probably expand 6.3
percent in 2011 after a recovery in  oil prices . Inflation slowed
to 13.7 percent in August from 14.1 percent a month earlier, the
statistics agency said Sept. 13.  The central bank also plans to introduce a Luanda Interbank
Offered Rate, or Luibor, to make the market “more dynamic,”
Pedro Castro e Silva, director of economic studies at the
central bank, said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
