The  Swiss National Bank  may post a
loss of 12 billion Swiss francs ($14.2 billion) in the first
half of the year,  NZZ am Sonntag  said, citing its own
calculations.  Assuming that the central bank’s foreign-currency reserves
didn’t change, the loss on those holdings will be between 10
billion francs and 11 billion francs because of the Swiss
curreny’s gains against most major currencies, the Zurich-based
newspaper reported. The loss on the gold holdings will be 1.8
billion francs, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
