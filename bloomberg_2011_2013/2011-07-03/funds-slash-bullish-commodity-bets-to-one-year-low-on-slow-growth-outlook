Funds reduced bullish bets on
commodity prices to the lowest level in almost a year on
speculation that slowing global growth will curb demand for
metals, energy and grains.  Speculators cut their net-long positions in 18 U.S.
commodities by 15 percent to 958,309 futures and options
contracts in the week ended June 28, government data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the lowest since the week ended July 13
last year. Declines were led by a 67 percent drop in holdings of
soybean meal. Investors trimmed bets on silver by 26 percent,
the most since May 2010.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
slumped 7.8 percent last quarter, the biggest such loss since
2008.  China ’s non-manufacturing industries expanded at the
slowest pace in four months in June, adding to concerns that
efforts to tame inflation are curbing growth in the world’s
second-biggest economy and largest consumer of commodities.  “You have slower imports and economic growth from China
and other regions of the world, and then you have the threat of
rising interest rates,” said Luis Rangel, a vice president at
ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey , who cited the end
of the second round of quantitative easing, or QE2. “Those are
the underlying factors that are slowing the commodity trend.”  Bullion Demand  Gold for August delivery advanced 0.9 percent to $1,495.60
an ounce by 10:13 a.m. London time on the Comex in  New York 
today, rallying from two straight weekly declines. Futures
tumbled to a six-week low on July 1 after  Greece  came closer to
staving off default, curbing demand for the metal as a haven
investment.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculative investors
decreased their net-long positions in New York gold futures by
18 percent in the week ended June 28, U.S. Commodities Futures
Trading Commission data show. Speculative long positions, or
bets that prices would rise, fell by 37,325 contracts to
165,902, CFTC data show.  Silver traders cut net-long positions by 17 percent from a
week earlier to 15,998 contracts, according to the CFTC. The
metal fell 2.7 percent last week.  Managed money bets that crude-oil prices will rise, in
futures and options combined, outnumbered short positions by
153,148 futures, the CFTC said. Net long positions fell by
14,322 contracts from a week earlier. Crude for August delivery
gained 0.2 percent to $95.12 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  today after falling 7.1 percent in June and 9.9 percent
in May.  Corn Prices  A measure of net-long positions in 11 U.S. farm goods
tumbled 10 percent to 604,091 contracts, the lowest since July
2010. Corn futures in Chicago reached $5.755 a bushel on July 1,
the lowest level for the most active contract since December.
The market is closed today for  Independence Day .  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut forecasts for corn and wheat
prices by 26 percent after a U.S. Department of Agriculture
report showed growers seeded more of the grains and stockpiles
were larger than expected. Goldman cut its soybean outlook by
7.1 percent  Corn and wheat will be at $5.90 a bushel in three months,
down from estimates of $8, Damien Courvalin and  Allison Nathan ,
New York-based analysts at the investment bank, said in a report
on July 1. Corn futures plunged 8.3 percent in the two days
after the release of the report and wheat fell 9.2 percent.  The USDA report “caught the market by surprise and may
exacerbate the near-term decline in prices, especially for
corn,” the Goldman Sachs analysts said.  Higher Than Estimated  U.S. farmers planted 92.282 million acres of corn this
year, 1.8 percent more than projected by analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey and the second-highest since 1944, the agency said
in its report. Stockpiles as of June 1 were 3.67 billion
bushels, 12 percent higher than forecast.  Farmers planted 13.627 million acres of spring wheat, 2.6
percent above estimates by analysts, the USDA said. U.S.
inventories as of June 1 totaled 861 million bushels, topping
forecasts by 4.6 percent.  “The USDA has surprised the market on a number of
occasions with its data releases and today’s revisions to its
planted area and quarterly grain stocks estimates in the grain
markets were no exception,” Rabobank analysts Luke Chandler,
Erin FitzPatrick and Keith Flury said in a June 30 report. The
reports are “significantly bearish” for grains, they said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
