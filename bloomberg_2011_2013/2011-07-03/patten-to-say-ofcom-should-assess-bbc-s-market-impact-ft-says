Chairman Chris Patten will suggest that restrictions on the
commercial activities of the  BBC  should be tightened and that
market-regulator Ofcom should carry out market-impact
assessments to see whether the broadcaster’s plans could block
commercial competitors or distort U.K. markets, the Financial
Times reported.  Patten, a former Conservative Party chairman, will also
rule out any public sale of the commercial unit, BBC Worldwide,
the FT said, citing two unidentified people the newspaper said
have read a speech Patten is scheduled to give to the Royal
Television Society on July 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
