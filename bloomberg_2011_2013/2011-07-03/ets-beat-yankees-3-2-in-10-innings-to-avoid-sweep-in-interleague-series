The  New York Mets  avoided a sweep in
their three-game interleague series against the  New York
Yankees , winning 3-2 in 10 innings after tying the game in the
bottom of the ninth against  Mariano Rivera .  Jason Bay delivered a game-winning single in the bottom of
the 10th inning yesterday after an error by Yankees shortstop
Ramiro Pena loaded the bases with two outs.  The Yankees led 2-1 and were one strike away from a sweep
before the Mets rallied against Rivera, whose 580 saves rank
second in Major League Baseball history. With two outs, Bay
walked and Lucas Duda and Ronny Paulino followed with back-to-
back singles to force extra innings at Citi Field.  “This game is enormous,” Mets manager Terry Collins told
reporters. “To have the game we had, to battle to the end and
to score off Mariano, it doesn’t happen very often.”  In the 10th inning, the Mets loaded the bases on a walk, a
hit batter and Pena’s error before Bay’s single off Hector Noesi, the Yankees’ third relief pitcher of the inning. Pena
also made an error in the ninth inning for the Yankees, who are
scheduled to activate starting shortstop  Derek Jeter  from the
15-day disabled list today. Jeter made his second rehab
appearance for the Yankees’ Double-A minor league affiliate in
Trenton,  New Jersey , last night.  The Yankees fell to 13-5 against National League teams this
season and have a 4-2 record against the Mets. The Yankees are
50-32 overall, the best record in the  American League , and are
14-4 without Jeter.  The Mets, held to one run over the first seven innings by
Yankees starting pitcher Freddy Garcia, improved to 42-42.  Bay Comes Through  “To come through in an unbelievable game and to come back
in a big series, just to salvage that, it means a lot,” said
Bay, who is hitting .242 after collecting eight hits in his last
22 at-bats.  The Yankees had snapped a 1-1 tie in the eighth inning as
 Brett Gardner  hit a leadoff triple and scored on a sacrifice fly
by  Curtis Granderson . Gardner had been hitless in his previous
28 at-bats at Citi Field.  Mets shortstop  Jose Reyes , voted to the All-Star team
yesterday, missed the series finale with tightness in his left
hamstring. The injury was diagnosed as a Grade 1 strain -- the
mildest form -- and Reyes’s availability is day-to-day, the Mets
said. Reyes, who was limited to 36 games during the 2009 season
because of leg injuries, has a major league-best .354 batting
average, 124 hits and 15 triples.  Jose Bautista hit his major league-leading 27th home run
yesterday as the  Toronto Blue Jays  beat the Philadelphia
Phillies 7-4 to avoid a three-game sweep. Phillies starting
pitcher  Cliff Lee  had his scoreless innings streak ended at 34,
allowing six earned runs over 7 1/3 innings.  In yesterday’s other interleague games, it was Cincinnati
7, Cleveland 5; Detroit 6, San Francisco 3; Baltimore 5, Atlanta
4; Tampa Bay 8, St. Louis 3; Boston 2, Houston 1; Minnesota 9,
Milwaukee 7; Kansas City 16, Colorado 8; Oakland 7, Arizona 2;
Seattle 3, San Diego 1; Florida 6, Texas 4; the Los Angeles
Angels 3, the Los Angeles Dodgers 1; and the Chicago Cubs 3,
Chicago White Sox 1. In the National League, it was Pittsburgh
10, Washington 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
