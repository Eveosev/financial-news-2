Mark Foster failed to convert a
third-round lead into a title for a second straight week as
Thomas Levet pipped him to the French Open golf title today in
Paris.  France ’s Levet finished one shot ahead of Denmark’s
Thorbjoern Olesen and England’s Foster, who also let a lead slip
in last week’s BMW International Open.  Levet, 42, receives a check for 500,000 euros ($726,000)
after collecting his  sixth European Tour title . His last victory
was at the Spanish Open in 2009.  The Frenchman finished on 7-under-par 277 following a 1-
under round today. Olesen was also 1-under today, while Foster
was 3-over. Germany’s  Martin Kaymer , No. 4 in the Official World
Golf Ranking, finished two shots further back after a 2-over
round.  Last year’s champion, Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain, failed
even to make the halfway cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
