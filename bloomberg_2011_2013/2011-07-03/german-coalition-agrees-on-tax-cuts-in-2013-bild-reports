German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
the heads of her coalition parties agreed to cut taxes and
social-security contributions in January 2013,  Bild newspaper 
reported, citing an internal document.  A favorable economic environment opens up leeway for such a
move, Christian Social Union head Horst Seehofer, Free
Democratic Party chief Philipp Roesler and Merkel said in the
document, without specifying the size of the cuts, the newspaper
wrote. The coalition will present a draft law before adopting
the 2012 budget, Bild said.  At the same time, the government is keeping to its goal of
consolidating its budget, the newspaper said, citing the
document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
