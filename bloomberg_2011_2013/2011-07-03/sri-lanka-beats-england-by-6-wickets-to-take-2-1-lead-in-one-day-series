Sri Lanka  beat England by six wickets
in the third one-day cricket international at Lord’s in London
to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five series.  Dinesh Chandimal hit an unbeaten 105 as Sri Lanka reached
its victory target with 10 balls remaining. Mahela Jayawardene
scored 79 for the visitors, who made 249-4 in response to
England’s 246-7. England’s new one-day captain Alastair Cook
top-scored for his team with 119.  England opened the series with a win before slipping to a
69-run defeat two days ago. The next match is in Nottingham on
July 6, with the final match in Manchester three days later.  England won a three-match Test series 1-0, with Sri Lanka
defeating the hosts in the only Twenty20 international.  Stuart Broad of England was fined 50 percent of his match
fee for the second one-day international in Leeds after showing
dissent at an umpire’s decision, the International Cricket
Council said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
