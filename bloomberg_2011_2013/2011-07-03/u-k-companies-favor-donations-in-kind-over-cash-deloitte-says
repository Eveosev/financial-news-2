U.K. corporate philanthropy is moving
away from cash contributions to offering business skills and
assets in an effort to win customers and socially-conscious
staff, according to  Deloitte LLP .  British companies are allowing employees more time to
volunteer for community projects and are opening their premises
for use by local groups as cash donations are forecast to fall,
Deloitte’s research shows.  U.K. companies spent 1.4 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) on
cash donations in 2010, according to the research. Those
contributions may fall by as much as a third this year, Deloitte
said.  “The focus of corporate responsibility projects for both
providers and beneficiaries is moving away from purely cash
donations to include benefits and resources such as staff
volunteering, the use of facilities or assets, or pro bono
business expertise,” Deloitte said. Philanthropy programs now
have “a clear strategic dimension to them,” the business
advisory firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
