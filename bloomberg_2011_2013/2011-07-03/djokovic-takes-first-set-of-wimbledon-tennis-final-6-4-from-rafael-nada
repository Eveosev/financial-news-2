Serbia’s Novak Djokovic won the
opening set of the Wimbledon men’s tennis final 6-4 against
defending champion  Rafael Nadal  as he targets his first title 
at the All England Club in  London .   The 24-year-old Djokovic, who will become the new No. 1 on
the ATP World Tour after Wimbledon, has yet to beat his 25-year-
old Spanish opponent in a Grand Slam tournament.  Djokovic, a two-time Australian Open winner, has beaten
Nadal in four finals this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
