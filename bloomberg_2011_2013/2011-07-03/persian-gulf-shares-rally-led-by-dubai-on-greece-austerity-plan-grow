Persian Gulf shares rose, sending
Dubai’s index up the most in more than three months, after
 Greece  passed a five-year austerity package to avoid default,
boosting investor appetite for riskier assets.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper in Dubai, jumped 3.3 percent and  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) ,
the United Arab Emirates’ biggest bank by assets, gained the
most since April. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  increased 2.4
percent, the most since March 20, to 1,553.91 as of 11:11 a.m.
in the emirate. Abu Dhabi’s ADX General Index climbed 0.6
percent and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  added 0.2 percent.
Israel’s measure surged 2 percent in  Tel Aviv .  “The marginal regional investor, providers of incremental
liquidity, have for many months now looked at global markets for
cues, so the strong global close last week certainly helped,”
said Sachin Mohindra, a  fund manager  at Invest AD in  Abu Dhabi .
“High net worth regional investors will continue to take cues
from global markets in the next few months.”  U.S. and European stocks rose last week after Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  on June 29 clinched enough votes to
pass the first part of an austerity plan aimed at meeting
European Union aid requirements and staving off default for his
debt-laden nation. Lawmakers backed a bill on June 30 to
authorize the measure.  U.S. stocks posted the biggest weekly rally since July
2009. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index soared 5.6 percent last
week, while the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 5.4
percent. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rallied 3.7 percent.  Attractive Valuations  “Valuations in key Gulf Cooperation Council stocks look
attractive relative to underlying growth and I expect long-term
investors to closely track second-quarter results to firm up
buying decisions,” Invest AD’s Mohindra said.  A decline of 4.7 percent this year has left the 31
companies on Dubai’s benchmark index valued at about 8.5 times
estimated earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with 11.1 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Emaar rose the most since June 15 to 3.12 dirhams and
Emirates NBD increased 6 percent, the most since April 27, to
4.40 dirhams.  Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL) , the home finance company majority owned by
 Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , rallied 2.4 percent to 87.1 fils. The
stock was included in the DFM General Index and the banking sub-
index.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  advanced 0.7 percent and Bahrain’s gauge
was little changed. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  added 0.2 percent, while
Kuwait’s SE Price Index slipped 0.4 percent.  In Tel Aviv, the TA-25 Index rallied the most since March
27 to 1,247.94. The yield on the 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit
government bond due January 2020 gained three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 5.19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
