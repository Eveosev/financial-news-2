Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  is
battling a  colon cancer  that has perforated his intestinal wall
and infected his abdomen, Spanish newspaper  El Periodico said ,
citing unidentified Venezuelan diplomats.  Chavez will have to use a colostomy bag for at least three
months, the Barcelona-based newspaper reported. Chavez, who is
recovering from two surgeries in Cuba, isnâ€™t able to begin
chemotherapy due to the infection, the paper said. The situation
is serious because the tumor may have metastasized, El Periodico
reported, citing the diplomats.  The first operation for a pelvic abscess was performed by a
Cuban surgeon while the second operation to remove the tumor was
performed by a Spanish surgeon in Havana the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
