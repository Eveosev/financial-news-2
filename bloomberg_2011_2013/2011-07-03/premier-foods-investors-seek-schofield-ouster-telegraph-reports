A group of  Premier Foods Plc (PFD) 
investors will ask Chairman Ronnie Bell to accelerate the
replacement of Chief Executive Officer Robert Schofield, the
Sunday Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Investors thought to include Paulson & Co. will ask for
Schofield, who has agreed to step down by April, to leave almost
immediately and for Chief Operating Officer Tim Kelly to be an
interim replacement, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
