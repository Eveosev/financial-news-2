Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chairman Clemens Boersig wants to finish his search for a successor to Chief
Executive Officer Josef Ackermann by September,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Boersig has sounded out internal candidates and is
currently talking to people from outside the company, FTD said.
Former Bundesbank President Axel Weber met Boersig at least
twice and responded to questions from the nomination committee
at one of the meetings before deciding to join  UBS AG (UBSN)  because it
avoided a conflict of interest and the Deutsche Bank selection
process was talking too long, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
