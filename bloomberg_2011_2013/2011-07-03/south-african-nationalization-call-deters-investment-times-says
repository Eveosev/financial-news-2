South Africa ’s National Union of
Mineworkers said calls by some within the ruling  African
National Congress  to nationalize the country’s mines has scared
off potential investors, the  Sunday Times  reported, citing union
leader Frans Baleni.  A Swiss company that had planned to invest 8 billion rand
($1.2 billion) in a mining operation has put that investment on
hold, Baleni told the Johannesburg-based newspaper. The company
had asked the union whether it should wait until after the ANC’s
elective conference in 2012 when a decision on nationalization
will be made, the newspaper said. The call by the ANC’s Youth
League for the government to seize mining assets has created
“lots of uncertainties,” Baleni told the Sunday Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
