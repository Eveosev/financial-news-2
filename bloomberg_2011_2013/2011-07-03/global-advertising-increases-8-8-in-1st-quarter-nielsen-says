global advertising rose 8.8 percent
in the first quarter, boosted by spending on television in  Asia 
and Latin America, according to Nielsen Holdings NV.  Spending rose to $118 billion in the three months ended
March 31 as global television advertising climbed 12 percent,
the New York-based media information company said in an e-mailed
statement today. Spending in the U.S., the largest advertising
market, rose 5.9 percent to about $27 billion as gains in
television, radio and magazines countered a 10 percent fall in
newspapers, it said.  “With $6.50 of every $10 being spent on television, it’s
clear that TV remains the most important and cost-effective
advertising medium for companies looking to reach new consumers,
especially in emerging markets,” Randall Beard, Nielsen’s
global head of advertiser solutions, said in the statement.  Total advertising spending in the Asia-Pacific region
jumped 12 percent and increased 11 percent in  Latin America .
Spending in the  Middle East  and Africa rose 10 percent even
though revenue in  Egypt  slumped 51 percent as most companies
halted advertising during a period of social and political
upheaval, it said.  The figures are based on published rate cards from
Nielsen’s Global AdView Pulse report, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
