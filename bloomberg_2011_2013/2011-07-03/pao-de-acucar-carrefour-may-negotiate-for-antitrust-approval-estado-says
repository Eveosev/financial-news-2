Pao de Acucar is willing to negotiate with Brazil’s antitrust
regulator, Cade, to win approval for a merger with  Carrefour
SA (CA) ’s local assets, O Estado de S. Paulo reported, citing Pao de
Acucar Chairman Abilio Diniz.  The combined retailer would have more than 30 percent of
sales in a third of the Brazilian municipalities where it
operates, which could be of concern to Cade, Diniz told the
newspaper. Pao de Acucar and Carrefour would have 69 percent of
sales in the state of  Sao Paulo , according to O Estado.  Pao de Acucar has been studying Carrefour for two years and
 Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO)  was aware of its interest, Diniz
told the newspaper. The Brazilian retailer will respect its
contract with Casino, he told O Estado. Diniz said he started
talks with  Brazil ’s state development bank about financing the
deal in February, according to O Estado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
