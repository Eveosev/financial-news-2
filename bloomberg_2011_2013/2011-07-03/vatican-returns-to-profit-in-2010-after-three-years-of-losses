The Vatican swung to a profit of 9.8
million euros ($14.2 million) in 2010 after three years of
losses during the recession.  The  Holy See , the central administration for the Roman
Catholic Church, had revenue of 245.2 million euros and expenses
of 235.3 million euros, its press office said yesterday in a
 statement . Donations fell 18 percent to $67.7 million.  The Vatican, which relies on earnings from investments in
stocks, bonds and real estate to supplement donations, recorded
a loss of 4.2 million euros in 2009.  Separately, the Vatican Governorate, the institution that
runs  Vatican City  and its support offices, had a net income of
21 million euros as revenue was boosted by a recovery in
financial markets and a higher number of visitors to its
museums.  To contact the reporter on this story:
