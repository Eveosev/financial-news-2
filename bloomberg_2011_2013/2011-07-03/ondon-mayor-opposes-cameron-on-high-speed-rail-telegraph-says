London Mayor  Boris Johnson  said he
can no longer support Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s proposals
for a high-speed rail link from the capital to northern England,
the Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported.  Johnson, a member of Cameron’s Conservative Party, said in
a letter to opponents of the rail project last month that the
plans for the route are “inadequate” and “perverse,” the
newspaper said. Johnson cited the failure to put the line in a
tunnel under parts of west London and a lack of proposals to
expand transport links from the Euston terminus in the capital.  The 32 billion-pound ($51 billion) line will link London to
Birmingham, with a spur to Heathrow Airport, and then run on to
Manchester and Leeds.  Johnson faces re-election next year and will be challenged
by his predecessor, Ken Livingstone of the opposition  Labour
Party . Johnson clashed with Cameron last year over a planned
reduction in housing benefits that he said risked leading to
“Kosovo-style social cleansing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
