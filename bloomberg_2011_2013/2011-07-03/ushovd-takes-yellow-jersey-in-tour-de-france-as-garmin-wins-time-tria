Thor Hushovd of  Norway  took the
yellow jersey as overall leader in cycling’s Tour de France
after his Garmin-Cervelo outfit won the second stage, a team
time trial.  Garmin-Cervelo covered the 23 kilometers (14.3 miles)
around Les Essarts in 24 minutes, 48 seconds today. BMC was
second and Team Sky third, both four seconds back.  Hushovd’s teammate David Millar of Scotland is second
overall, with Australia’s Cadel Evans third and Geraint Thomas
of Wales fourth.  Yesterday, Belgium’s Philippe Gilbert won the opening
stage. Defending champion Alberto Contador of Spain finished
down the field after being delayed in a pile-up during the
191.5-kilometer ride from Passage du Gois to Mont des Alouettes.
Contador is 75th overall, Gilbert 30th.  Tomorrow’s third stage is a 198-kilometer trip from Olonne-
sur-Mer to Redon. The Tour ends July 24 on the Champs-Elysees in
Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
