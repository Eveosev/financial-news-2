Two shareholders at  London Stock
Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  want non-executive directors Robert Webb and
Janet Cohen to quit the board at the company’s annual meeting
later this month, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported.  The shareholders are dissatisfied with their high pay and
10 years’ service, the newspaper reported, without saying where
it obtained the information. Webb was paid 72,000 pounds
($115,700) last year and Cohen 76,000 pounds, the newspaper
said. One of the shareholders is “thought to be” Artemis
Investment Management Ltd., the newspaper said, without
disclosing the name of the second shareholder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
