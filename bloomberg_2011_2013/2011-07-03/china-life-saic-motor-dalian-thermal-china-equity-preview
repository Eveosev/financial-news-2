vehicle partner with Ford Motor Co., gained 7.2 percent to 28.99
yuan after saying it expects its current pretax profit to

shareholders five bonus shares and a 1 yuan cash dividend for
every 10 shares held. The stock trades at 17 times its estimated
2011 profit, compared with its four-year average of 25 times,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Zijin shares have been traded low after the company’s
toxic spill last year,” said Owen Liang, an analyst at Guotai
Junan Securities Co. in Shenzhen. “Purchases were also
triggered as Chinese investors seek companies that give a high
number of bonus shares.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
