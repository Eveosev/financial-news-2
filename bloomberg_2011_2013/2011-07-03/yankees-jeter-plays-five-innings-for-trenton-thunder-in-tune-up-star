New York Yankees shortstop  Derek Jeter , who has missed more than two weeks with a calf strain,
played five innings for the Double-A  Trenton Thunder  last night
in the first of two tune-up games.  Six hits shy of 3,000 for his Major League career, Jeter
may rejoin the Yankees lineup tomorrow in the first game of a
series against the  Cleveland Indians . Meanwhile, he will play
again tonight for the Thunder.  Batting leadoff for the Thunder, Jeter went 1-for-2 with a
walk, singling and scoring a run as the Thunder beat the Altoona
Curve 4-3 at Waterfront Park in Trenton,  New Jersey .  In the first inning, he reached first on a ground ball to
left field, went to third on Corban Joseph’s double and scored
on Austin Romine’s sacrifice fly.  The shortstop ended the second inning for the Thunder when
he lined out to first base. Jeter then walked in the fifth and
was replaced by a pinch-runner.  Jeter, 37, is bidding to become the first Yankee and the
28th player in baseball history to accumulate 3,000 hits.  Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  indicated he may sit Jeter in a
game next week so the shortstop would have an opportunity to
reach the milestone at Yankee Stadium during a four-game series
against the  Tampa Bay Rays , ESPN reported.  Jeter was placed on the 15-day disabled list a day after he
strained his right calf during a June 13 game against the
Indians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
