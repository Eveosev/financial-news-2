UBS AG (UBSN)  Chairman Kaspar Villiger said
the bank isn’t discussing selling its U.S. wealth management
business,  SonntagsZeitung  reported.  While the unit’s operations have been “disappointing,”
UBS saw a turnaround in the first quarter, Villiger told the
Zurich-based newspaper. Selling the business “is not an
issue,” he said.  Villiger also said he can’t exclude further job cuts.
Still, the bank wants to expand in certain areas and wants to
regain market share in  Switzerland , he said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
