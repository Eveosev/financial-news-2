Israel and  China  today signed a
cooperation agreement that aims to boost trade between the two
countries.  The accord, signed in Jerusalem with China’s top economic
planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission,
establishes an “important basis” for bilateral trade ties,
Israeli Minister of Industry, Trade and Labor Shalom Simhon said
in an e-mailed statement.  In the short term, the agreement is expected to deepen ties
between Israeli and Chinese businessmen, and in the medium to
long term improve trade conditions between the countries, Eliran
Elimelech, Israel’s commercial attaché in Beijing, said in the
statement. Following the signing, officials plan to map out
joint projects in fields including biotechnology, agriculture
and water technology, the statement said.  Israel  is looking to  Asia  to increase trade as the U.S. and
European Union struggle to recover from the global economic
slowdown. Israeli exports to Asia expanded an annual 45 percent
last year, almost double the growth in sales to  Europe  and
quadruple those to the U.S., the Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau
of Statistics  said in January. Exports to China grew an annual
95 percent in 2010 to $2 billion, according to the ministry.  Exports make up about 40 percent of Israel’s gross domestic
product, with about 60 percent of goods sold to the U.S. and
Europe. About 20 percent go to Asia, the statistics bureau said
in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
