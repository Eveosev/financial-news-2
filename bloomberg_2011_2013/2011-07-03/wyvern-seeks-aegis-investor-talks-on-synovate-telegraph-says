Wyvern Partners will tomorrow seek
meetings with  Aegis Group Plc (AGS) ’s biggest shareholders to prove it
has a client willing to pay about 600 million pounds ($964
million) for Aegis’s Synovate market research business, the
 Sunday Telegraph  said.  Wyvern will contact investors such as French entrepreneur
 Vincent Bollore , the newspaper reported without saying where it
got the information. Aegis previously shunned a request for
talks because Wyvern’s client hadn’t been revealed to them, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
