Alfonso Cano, leader of  Colombia ’s
biggest rebel group, narrowly missed being caught or killed
during a military attack on his jungle camp, leaving the area
just 12 hours earlier, President  Juan Manuel Santos  said.  Cano, who in 2008 took the helm of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, fled the camp near Chaparral, Tolima just
before troops raided the camp hidden in a thick jungle canopy,
Santos said. Cigarette butts thought to be the brand favored by
Cano were found littered around the camp, he said.  “We were very close to Cano,” Santos said in a televised
press conference in Bogota. “He didn’t die, but he was very
close. Sooner or later he will fall, like all the other FARC
leaders.”  Cano, 62, an academic from Bogota whose middle-class
background differs from the FARC’s peasant base, has attempted
to reignite morale in the drug-funded group and show it is still
relevant after repeated government attacks depleted its numbers
and killed some of its key leaders. Cano replaced FARC founder
Manuel Marulanda, who died of a heart attack.  Santos and his predecessor Alvaro Uribe have waged a brutal
offensive against the group, which has fought the government for
almost a half century. The group’s numbers dwindled to fewer
than 8,000 from a peak of about 17,000 in 2002 as FARC fighters
deserted their ranks, according to the government.  Cano, whose real name is Guillermo Saenz, was an
anthropology professor from Bogota before joining the FARC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
