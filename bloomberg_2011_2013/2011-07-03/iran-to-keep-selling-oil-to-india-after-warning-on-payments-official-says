Iran ’s oil exports to  India  are
continuing with no plans to halt supplies after a warning to the
neighboring country over delays in paying for imported crude, an
Iranian Oil Ministry official said.  “A warning was sent to indebted refineries but sending
this letter doesn’t mean Iran’s oil exports to India were cut,”
Mohsen Qamsari, the National Iranian Oil Co.’s head of
international affairs, told the Oil Ministry’s news website,
 Shana . “We have no intention of halting our supplies to the
Indian market.”  A Wall Street Journal report published July 1 cited two
Indian refiners as saying that Iran warned it will stop oil
supplies starting next month if pending bills aren’t cleared.
NIOC made the warning in a letter requesting a sustainable
mechanism for making payments, the WSJ reported.  Indian refiners owe Iran about $2 billion over oil imports
due to complications on making payments to the Persian Gulf
country. Iran is under international sanctions over its nuclear
program, and punitive measures include restrictions on financial
transactions with the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
