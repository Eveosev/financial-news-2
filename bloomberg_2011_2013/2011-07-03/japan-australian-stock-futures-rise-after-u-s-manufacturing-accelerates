Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose after a report showed U.S. manufacturing
unexpectedly accelerated in June, a sign the industry is
rebounding after a shortage of parts and components from Japan
slowed production.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s biggest carmaker by market value, rose 1.2 percent from
the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Sony Corp. (6758) , which
gets about a half of its sales in the U.S. and Europe, gained
1.1 percent. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest
mining company, advanced 1.2 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,985 in Chicago on July 1, compared with
9,850 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,960
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 1.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.4 percent in Wellington  “The increase in the manufacturing index shows U.S.
consumption is favorable, and signals the economy will further
recover through the end of this year,” said  Takero Inaizumi ,
head of equity research in  Tokyo  at Mizuho Investors Securities
Co. “The investment environment is changing as concerns ease
about a U.S. economic slowdown and Greek debt.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index advanced 1.4 percent on July 1 after
the Institute for Supply Management’s factory index rose to 55.3
last month from 53.5 in May, the first gain in four months.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News estimated the index would
drop to 52. Figures greater than 50 signal an expansion.  Greece’s Financing  Global stocks also rose on July 1 after Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  won approval of two bills to
authorize a 78 billion-euro ($113 billion) package of budget
cuts and asset sales, a key to receiving further international
financial aid.  Also, Austrian Finance Ministry official Thomas Wieser said
 Greece  may receive as much as 85 billion euros in new financing,
including a contribution from private investors, in a second
bailout aimed at stopping the country from defaulting on its
debt.  On July 2, the euro rose for the first time in four weeks
against the dollar as optimism Greece will solve its sovereign-
debt problems increased after lawmakers approved fiscal
austerity measures.  The euro gained to as much as 117.61 yen today in Tokyo,
its highest level in almost four weeks. A stronger euro boosts
the value of European income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.6 percent this year
through July 1, compared with a gain of 6.5 percent by the  S&P
500  and a drop of 0.3 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500
and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
