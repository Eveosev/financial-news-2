Dominique Strauss-Kahn  should return
to the French political scene, according to 49 percent of people
surveyed by the French daily  Le Parisien . A total of 45 percent
said he shouldn’t come back to politics, the poll showed.  Harris Interactive  conducted the survey for Le Parisien,
questioning 1,000 adults online from July 1 at 8 p.m. local time
through July 2. That was after the former International Monetary
Fund chief, accused of the sexual assault and attempted rape of
a hotel maid in New York on May 14, was released on his
recognizance. The case against him wasn’t dismissed and his next
court hearing is scheduled for July 18. Strauss-Kahn has pleaded
not guilty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
