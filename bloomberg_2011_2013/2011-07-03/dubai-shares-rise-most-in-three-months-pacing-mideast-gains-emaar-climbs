Dubai’s shares climbed the most in
more than three months, pacing gains in the  Middle East , as
investor appetite for riskier assets increased after  Greece 
passed an austerity package to avoid default.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper in Dubai, jumped 3.6 percent and  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) ,
the United Arab Emirates’ biggest bank by assets, advanced to
the highest in almost two weeks. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose
2.4 percent, the most since March 20, to 1,553.31 at the 2 p.m.
close in the emirate. Abu Dhabi’s ADX General Index climbed 0.2
percent and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  added 0.3 percent.
Israel’s measure surged 2.4 percent in Tel Aviv.  “The marginal regional investor, providers of incremental
liquidity, have for many months now looked at global markets for
cues, so the strong global close last week certainly helped,”
said Sachin Mohindra, a  fund manager  at Invest AD in  Abu Dhabi .
“High net worth regional investors will continue to take cues
from global markets in the next few months.”  U.S. and European stocks rose last week after Greek Prime
Minister George Papandreou on June 29 clinched enough votes to
pass the first part of a five-year austerity plan aimed at
meeting European Union aid requirements and staving off default
for his debt-laden nation. Lawmakers backed a bill on June 30 to
authorize the measure.  U.S. stocks posted the biggest weekly rally since July
2009. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index soared 5.6 percent last
week, while the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 5.4
percent. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rallied 3.7 percent.  Attractive Valuations  “Valuations in key Gulf Cooperation Council stocks look
attractive relative to underlying growth, and I expect long-term
investors to closely track second-quarter results to firm up
buying decisions,” Invest AD’s Mohindra said.  A decline of 4.7 percent this year has left the 31
companies on Dubai’s benchmark index valued at about 8.5 times
estimated earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with 11.1 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Emaar rose the most since May 10 to 3.13 dirhams and
Emirates NBD increased 2.4 percent to 4.25 dirhams, the highest
level since June 20.  Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL) , the home finance company
majority owned by  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , rallied 3.4 percent
to 88 fils. The stock was included in the DFM General Index and
the banking sub-index.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  advanced 1.4 percent, Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30) 
gained 0.3 percent and Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index
added 0.1 percent. Kuwait’s SE Price Index retreated 0.6 percent
and Bahrain’s gauge slipped 0.2 percent. In North Africa,
 Egypt ’s  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  advanced 0.9 percent.  In Israel, the TA-25 Index rallied the most since May 10 to
1,252.91. The yield on the 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit government
bonds due January 2020 gained three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
