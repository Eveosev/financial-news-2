Daimler AG (DAI)  would welcome more Chinese
investors, Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche told  Germany ’s
 Bild newspaper  in an interview.  “Chinese investors are already shareholders of the
company,” Zetsche was quoted as saying. “I would welcome it if
their number increased.”  At the same time, Zetsche said he’d rule out a scenario in
which Chinese investors tried to gain control over the company
against Germany’s wishes, Bild reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
