The U.K. will provide emergency food
relief for 1.3 million people in  Ethiopia  for the next three
months as the country faces its worst drought in a decade,
International Development Secretary  Andrew Mitchell  said.  “Through no fault of its own, the Horn of Africa is
experiencing a severe drought caused by the failed rains,”
Mitchell said in an e-mailed statement today. “Britain is
acting quickly and decisively in Ethiopia to stop this crisis
becoming a catastrophe.”  “This situation needs an international response and
Britain is calling on the international community to provide the
fast, effective relief that Ethiopia needs now in this difficult
time,” he said.  The UN World Food Program said June 29 that drought is
threatening around 9 million people contending with rising food
costs and conflict across Somalia, Ethiopia,  Djibouti , Kenya and
parts of Uganda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
