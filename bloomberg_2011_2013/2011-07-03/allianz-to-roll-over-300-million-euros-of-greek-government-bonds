Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s largest insurer,
plans to roll over Greek  government bonds  as part of a private-
sector contribution to a second aid package for the debt-
strapped nation.  Allianz will reinvest 300 million euros ($436 million) of
Greek debt into new securities, spokesman Christian Kroos said
by telephone. Chief Executive Officer Michael Diekmann had told
Germany’s Spiegel magazine the company would contribute that
amount toward a rescue package for Greece through 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
