Saudi Arabia , the worldâ€™s largest oil
exporter, reported a 20 percent growth in petrochemicals
shipments in April on higher demand from Asia.  Companies including  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC)  exported
2.66 million tons of petrochemicals in April compared with 2.21
million tons in the year-ago period, the  Saudi Ports Authority 
said on its website today. That is similar to the shipments in
March and 6.4 percent higher than in February.  Saudi Arabia shipped 9.97 million metric tons of
petrochemicals from its ports from January through April
compared with 9.07 million tons in the year-earlier period,
according to the port authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
