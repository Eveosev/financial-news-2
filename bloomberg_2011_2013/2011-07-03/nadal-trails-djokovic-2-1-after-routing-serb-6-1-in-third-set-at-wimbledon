Defending champion  Rafael Nadal  won
the third set of the Wimbledon men’s tennis final against Novak Djokovic to maintain his chances of lifting the title for a
third time. He’d lost the first two sets.   The 25-year-old Spaniard, who hasn’t been beaten at the All
England Club in  London  since 2007, now trails 4-6, 1-6, 6-1
against Djokovic, 24, who will become the new No. 1 on the ATP
World Tour after Wimbledon.   Nadal is trying to match Bjorn Borg’s record of winning the
French Open and Wimbledon in the same year on three occasions.
He’s defeated Djokovic in their previous five Grand Slam
meetings, but lost to the Serb in four finals this season.  Djokovic secured the only break of the first set in the
10th game, winning four straight points after Nadal had gone 30-
0. Nadal hit his first serve into the net, then hit a forehand
wide.  Two breaks in the second set put Djokovic in control, but
Nadal came back to take the third set.  No player has come from two sets down to win the men’s
final at Wimbledon since  France ’s Henri Cochet in 1927.
Argentina’s Gaston Gaudio did the same in the championship match
at the 2004 French Open.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
