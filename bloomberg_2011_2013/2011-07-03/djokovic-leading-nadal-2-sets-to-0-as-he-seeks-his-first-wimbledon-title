Serbia’s Novak Djokovic took a two-
set lead against defending champion  Rafael Nadal  in the
Wimbledon men’s tennis final as he targets a first title at the
All England Club in  London .    Djokovic, 24, who will become the new No. 1 on the ATP
World Tour after Wimbledon, leads his 25-year-old Spanish
opponent 6-4, 6-1. Nadal has recovered from two sets down three
times in his career.  The Serb, a two-time Australian Open winner, has beaten
Nadal in four finals this season. He has yet to beat Nadal in a
Grand Slam tournament and the Spaniard was last defeated at
Wimbledon in 2007.  Djokovic secured the only break of the first set in the
10th game, winning four straight points after Nadal had gone 30-
0. Nadal hit his first serve into the net, then hit a forehand
wide.  He broke Nadal twice in the second set.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
