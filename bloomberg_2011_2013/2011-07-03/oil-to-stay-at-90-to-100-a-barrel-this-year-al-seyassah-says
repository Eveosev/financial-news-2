Crude prices will remain at $90 to
$100 a barrel until the end of 2011 following the IEA’s decision
to coordinate the release of oil stockpiles,  Al-Seyassah 
reported, citing a member of  Kuwait ’s Supreme Petroleum Council.  Kuwait is not affected by the  International Energy Agency ’s
decision, Emad al-Ateeqi said, according to the Kuwaiti
newspaper. The IEA advises many of the world’s most advanced
economies. The Supreme Petroleum Council is the Gulf nation’s
highest decision-making body for oil policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
