Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest
importer of barley and a major food importer, said purchases of
foodstuff fell 28 percent in April from a year earlier, while
imports of building material increased.  Imports amounted to 5.46 million tons in the month, with
food and building materials accounting for almost half of the
total, the Saudi  Port Authority  said on its  website  today.  Saudi Arabia, which imports most of the food to feed its
population of 27 million people, bought 1.46 million metric tons
in April compared with 2.03 million tons a year earlier.  The Arab world’s largest economy said food imports between
January and April fell 23 percent from a year earlier to 4.83
million metric tons, according to the data.  Imports of building and construction materials rose 8
percent to 1.2 million metric tons in April from a year earlier.
Saudi Arabia plans to invest $400 million through 2014 to
develop infrastructure and build four new cities. The country
also announced in March that it plans to build half a million
new units to provide housing for its citizens.  In the four months through April, imports of building
material jumped 21 percent to 4.66 million tons from the same
period a year ago, the data showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
