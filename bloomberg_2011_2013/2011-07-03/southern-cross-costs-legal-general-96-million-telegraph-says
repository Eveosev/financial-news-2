Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN)  may have
lost more than 60 million pounds ($96 million) from the fall in
share price of Southern Cross Healthcare Plc, the  Sunday
Telegraph  reported, citing regulatory filings.  Legal & General made its first big investment in October
2006, when the stock was priced at more than 300 pence, the
newspaper said, and the shares are now valued at 7 pence. While
pension funds have largely sold the stock,  hedge funds  such as
Breeden Capital Management LLC have bought large stakes, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
