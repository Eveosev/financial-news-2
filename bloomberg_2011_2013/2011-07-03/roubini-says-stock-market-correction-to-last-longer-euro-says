Nouriel Roubini , the New York
University professor and co-founder and chairman of Roubini
Global Economics LLC, expects the latest stock-market correction
to take longer,  Euro am Sonntag  reported.  “Many things are fueling uncertainty in the markets and
will lead to volatility,” Roubini told the newspaper in an
interview. “Economic data from the U.S. and the U.K. are weak,
 Japan  fell back into recession” and “the debt crisis in the
periphery of  Europe  is an extremely high factor of
uncertainty,” he said.  The situation in Portugal is “almost worse” than in
Greece because the country lacks competitiveness, Roubini said.
“Because of all the risks for the economy and markets I don’t
believe anybody who says that the stock-market correction will
be one of short duration.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
