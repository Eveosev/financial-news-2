RWE AG (RWE)  is working with  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  as  Germany ’s second-largest utility considers a sale
of its Npower unit in the U.K., according to a person familiar
with the matter.  The examination of the business, which had revenue of 7.8
billion euros ($11.3 billion)  last year , is preliminary and the
Essen, Germany-based company may not pursue a sale, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the discussions
are private. A person familiar with the matter said in February
that RWE was considering a sale of U.K. assets.  RWE plans to raise as much as 8 billion euros with asset
divestments by 2013 to cut debt after its borrowings surged with
the acquisition of a Dutch competitor in 2009. The utility also
faces a tax on its German nuclear  power plants  that will reduce
earnings starting this year.  “The U.K. continues to be a core market of RWE,” Peter
Hoscheidt, a spokesman for the company, said to Bloomberg News
in an e-mailed statement today. “Beyond that, we don’t have any
further comment on market speculation, which this is.”  Npower supplies natural gas and power and owns fossil-fuel-
fired electricity plants, according to its  website . RWE’s
renewable-energy unit, called Innogy, operates about  550
megawatts  of  wind turbines  and hydropower facilities in the U.K.  RWE may sell Npower, one of the U.K.’s six leading energy
companies, for 5 billion pounds ($8 billion), the London-based
Times reported today, citing unidentified people familiar with
the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
