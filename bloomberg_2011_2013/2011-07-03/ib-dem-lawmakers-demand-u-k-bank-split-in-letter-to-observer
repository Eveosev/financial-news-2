Lawmakers from the Liberal Democrats,
the U.K.’s junior coalition party, called on Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  to split banks’ retail operations from
 investment banking  in a  letter to the Observer newspaper .  “Ring-fencing retail and investment banking through
‘Chinese walls’ in the manner suggested and endorsed by the
chancellor, George Osborne, will not produce a banking system
that is safe and fit for purpose,” the lawmakers wrote. “If
companies can continue to move capital between retail and
investment banking, the latter could still endanger the former.
As a first step, full separation of banking functions is needed
to better insulate the taxpayer against failure.”  The letter was signed by lower-house lawmaker Adrian Sanders and Trevor Smith, a member of the upper House of Lords,
as well as other senior Liberal Democrats and opposition Labour
lawmakers, the Observer said.  Osborne, a member of Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
 Conservative Party , said last month he will back proposals put
forward in April by the Independent Commission on Banking to
erect firebreaks around the consumer-banking units of lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
