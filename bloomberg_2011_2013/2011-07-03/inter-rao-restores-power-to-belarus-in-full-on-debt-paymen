OAO Inter RAO UES,  Russia ’s state-
controlled power exporter, resumed supplies to Belarus in full
after the country paid off debts for previous deliveries.  The supplies were restored yesterday, said a press officer
for the Moscow-based power utility who declined to be identified
because of company policy.  Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  ordered the resumption of
electricity supplies to the neighboring country, a day after
Belarus announced that it paid the final 611 million Russian
rubles ($22 million) owed, Medvedev’s spokeswoman, Natalia
Timakova, said yesterday.  Inter RAO had cut power to Belarus on June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
