German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government raised borrowing targets by more than 10 percent for
the three years through 2015 after pledging contributions to a
future European bailout fund, its multi-year budget plan shows.  Borrowing will amount to 24.9 billion euros ($36.2 billion)
in 2013, more than the 22.3 billion euros the Cabinet endorsed
on March 16, according to the 2013-2015 budget plan drafted by
the Finance Ministry. The government aims to borrow 18.7 billion
euros in 2014 and 14.7 billion euros in 2015, up from 15.3
billion euros and 13.3 billion euros, respectively.  The outline still leaves  Germany  on track to adhere to the
so-called debt brake from 2016 that’s enshrined in the country’s
constitution, a  Finance Ministry  official said on July 1 in
Berlin, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Germany’s borrowing will drop from less than 30 billion
euros this year to 27.2 billion euros in 2012, another Finance
Ministry official said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
The 2012 total is less than the 31.5 billion euros in borrowing
the Cabinet approved in March.  The euro area approved over the weekend its share of a 12
billion-euro aid payment for Greece and pledged to complete work
in the coming weeks on a second rescue package for the cash-
strapped nation to prevent a default.  Europe  is trying to draw a
line under a debt crisis that  Greece  sparked more than a year
ago and threatens the 17-nation monetary union.  Leaders are also setting up a permanent emergency aid
program, the European Stability Mechanism, that will come into
effect in mid-2013. Germany agreed to grant around 22 billion
euros in capital over five years to the ESM.  Tax Income  Germany’s budget outline takes into account higher-than-
expected tax revenue on the back of faster-than-forecast
economic growth, as well as income losses from an early shutdown
of nuclear reactors and the likelihood that proceeds from a
planned financial-transaction tax won’t materialize.  Germany’s overall budget deficit, which includes the 16
states, cities and the social insurance system, will likely drop
below 2 percent of gross domestic product this year from 3.3
percent of GDP in 2010, one of the officials said. European
Union rules limit the shortfall to 3 percent of GDP.  There’s “very limited leeway” for measures such as tax
reductions that would place lasting burdens on the budget, the
Finance Ministry said in the draft. The budget plan aims to
secure permanent adherence to the debt brake, which calls for a
budget close to balance from 2016, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
