Corn and soybeans may rise this week
as demand climbs for U.S. supplies to make food, livestock feed
and fuel, while concerns mount that adverse weather in July or
August might damage Midwest crops.  Twenty-one of 29 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to Chicago on July 1 forecast that corn will rise, and 24 of 30
respondents said soybeans will gain.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery fell 5.6 percent to $5.9675 a bushel, the
sixth straight decline. Soybean futures for November delivery
rose 0.2 percent to $13.125 a bushel, snapping a three-week
slump.  The gain in soybeans last week was expected by the majority
of analysts and traders surveyed on June 24, while the drop in
corn was a surprise.  Bullish on corn: 21    Bullish on soybeans: 24
Bearish on corn:  8    Bearish on soybeans:  6  To contact the reporter on this story:
