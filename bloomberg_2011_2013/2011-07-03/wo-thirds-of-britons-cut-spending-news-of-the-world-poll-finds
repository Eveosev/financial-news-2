Two thirds of Britons say they have
cut back on spending recently, according to an ICM opinion poll
for today’s  News of the World  newspaper.  Of those respondents to the survey who said they’d reduced
their expenditure, 85 percent said they were eating out less and
making fewer trips to the cinema, while 78 percent were giving
up luxuries and 74 percent were buying supermarkets’ own-brand
items, the newspaper said. Fifty-nine percent were going without
a holiday.  Fifty-three percent of those questioned said they felt much
poorer than they did two or three years ago, while 52 percent
said they have less hope for the future.  ICM interviewed 1,001 adults by phone on July 1. The
newspaper gave no margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
