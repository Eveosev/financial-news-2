Hermes Investment Management Ltd.
wants fees paid to investment banks on takeover deals to be
based on the success of the projects, the Sunday Times reported.  Hermes, whose clients include BT Group Plc, proposed that
fees should be deferred for as long as two years and paid after
shareholders have determined if the deal was worthwhile, the
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
