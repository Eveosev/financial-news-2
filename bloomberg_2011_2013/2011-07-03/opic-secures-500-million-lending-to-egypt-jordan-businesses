The Overseas Private Investment
Corp., an independent agency of the U.S. government, secured
$500 million in loans for small businesses in Egypt and Jordan.  OPIC agreed to guarantee loans by local banks to small and
medium-sized enterprises, microfinance institutions, non-banking
financial institutions and other approved borrowers for up to
$250 million each for Egypt and Jordan, it said in a statement
on its  website . The project is meant to spur growth, create jobs
and support democratization in the  Middle East  and North Africa,
it said.  There are 1.9 million to 2.3 million small and medium-size
enterprises in the region, most without access to credit, it
said, citing a recent study by the International Finance Corp.
and McKinsey & Co.  The loans are part of a pledge made by US Secretary of
State  Hillary Clinton  during a trip to Egypt and  Tunisia  in
March to provide up to $2 billion in financial support to help
the private sector to grow, OPIC said. Pro-democracy protests
spread across the region this year, forcing the ouster of the
longstanding leaders of both North African countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
