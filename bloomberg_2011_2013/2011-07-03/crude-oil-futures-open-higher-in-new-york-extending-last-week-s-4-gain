Oil in  New York  traded near a two-
week high after the European Union authorized a loan payout for
Greece, easing speculation the country’s debt crisis will derail
the region’s economic recovery.  Futures climbed as much as 0.6 percent after European
finance ministers approved an 8.7 billion-euro ($12.6 billion)
aid payment to Greece on July 2.  Brent crude  gained as much as
0.4 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the “downside
risk” to oil would be “reduced proportionately” as sales of
stockpiles from members of the  International Energy Agency  might
be less than announced.  “We’re going to be choppy within the range around $95
today, with very little liquidity but no news to cause a move as
it’s the Fourth of July,” said Alexander Ridgers, London-based
head of commodities at CMC Markets, which handles about $240
million a day in U.S. crude contracts.  Crude for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose as much as 53 cents to $95.47 a barrel and was at
$95 at the 1:15 p.m. New York time close of electronic trading
on Globex. On June 30, the contract settled at $95.42, the
highest level in more than two weeks. Nymex floor trading was
closed today for the Fourth of July holiday. Electronic trades
will be booked with tomorrow’s transactions for settlement
purposes.  Debt Crisis  Brent oil for August settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange traded at $111.39, down 38 cents, at
1:30 p.m. New York time, after gaining as much as 39 cents to
$112.16. The European benchmark contract was at a premium of
$17.16 to U.S. futures. The spread reached a record $22.29 on
June 15.  New York crude slumped 11 percent in the second quarter as
 Greece ’s debt crisis fueled concerns that Europe’s economic
recovery might be stalled. European officials agreed last week
to make the payout after Greece’s parliament passed austerity
measures. Finance chiefs gather next week to tackle the
country’s long-term lifeline.  Oil dropped 4.6 percent June 23 after the IEA said members
will release 60 million barrels from strategic reserves over 30
days to make up for a supply shortfall in  Libya .  Goldman Sachs cut its estimate for the potential price
impact of the release because the actual amount sold may be
about 39 million barrels. Some member countries plan to only
reduce stockholding requirements for refiners, the bank said in
a report July 1.  Brent Outlook  Brent in 2011 may drop as much as $6 to $8 from a forecast
of $117 a barrel, compared with $10 to $12 previously estimated,
according to Goldman Sachs. Prices next year may be revised $3
to $5 lower from a forecast of $130 a barrel. The bank had
earlier predicted futures will decline as much as $5 to $7.  Bets among managed-money investors on gains in the price of
Brent declined last week, ICE Futures  Europe  said. Long
positions fell to 87,831 contracts, from 89,058 in the previous
week, ICE said today on its website. Long positions still
outnumbered those on declines by 38,530 contracts.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in U.S. crude in the week ended June 28,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Managed-
money bets that prices will rise, in futures and options
combined, outnumbered short positions by 153,148 futures, the
Washington-based regulator said in its weekly Commitments of
Traders report. Net-long positions fell by 14,322 contracts, or
8.6 percent, from a week earlier.  Exxon Mobil Corp. reduced production at its refinery in
Billings,  Montana , and shut a pipeline after as much as 1,000
barrels of heavy crude leaked into the Yellowstone River. A team
is investigating the cause of the spill that started July 1,
Exxon Mobil Pipeline Co. President Gary Pruessing said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
