Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said
Britain needs to overhaul the way it funds care for its old
people, as he awaited the publication of a report that may
recommend capping the amount the elderly have to pay.  “We will not be able to give people the quality of care
and support and the sense of security that they need in the
future unless we have change,” Lansley told  BBC  television’s
“Andrew Marr Show” yesterday. “If we carry on as we are,
we’re going to have increasingly large numbers of people” who
will create “more cost to the state later on.”  Andrew Dilnot, a former director of the  Institute for
Fiscal Studies  who’s drawn up the report on funding to be
published in London today, said last week that putting a cap on
elderly people’s contributions to the cost would allay concerns
that they might have to sell their home or eat into their
savings to pay for care.  “If a cap were put in place, we could take away the fear
that people would lose everything that they had built up, and in
particular people seem reasonably anxious that they might lose
all the value of their house,” Dilnot  told BBC News . “They
still have to pay something but much less than if they end up
with high care needs as it is at the moment.”  Currently, elderly people with more than 23,000 pounds
($37,000) in capital, including the value of their home, are
regarded as being  able to meet the full cost  of their care. The
BBC said Dilnot would recommend that their contribution should
be capped at 35,000 pounds.  Lansley said the government would give Dilnot’s report a
“very positive response,” though he refused to be drawn on the
possible level at which a cap would be set or how it would be
paid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
