Nasdaq OMX Group Inc (NDAQ)  has renewed its
interest in taking over the  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) , the
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  Nasdaq  Chief Executive Officer Bob Greifeld has asked his
team to look into the possibility of acquiring LSE, which the
company attempted to buy in 2006, the London-based newspaper
said today. Nasdaq has yet to appoint advisers to work on an
offer, it said.  LSE dropped its offer for Canadian rival TMX Group Inc.
last week, saying too few shareholders supported the C$3.32
billion ($3.5 billion) merger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
