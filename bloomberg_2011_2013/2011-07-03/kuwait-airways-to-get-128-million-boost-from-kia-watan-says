Kuwait Investment Authority  will
contribute 35 million dinars ($128 million) to make up for a
decline in Kuwait Airways Corp.’s market value,  Al-Watan 
reported, citing a report by the fund.  The value of the state-owned carrier being prepared for
sale dropped to 185 million dinars from 220 million dinars,
according to the newspaper. The wealth fund’s contribution is a
