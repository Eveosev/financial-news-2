Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Cabinet
approved a change to  Germany ’s renewable-energy law that will
reduce solar-energy subsidies six months earlier than originally
planned.   The above-market rates paid for solar power will be lowered
in July to 15 percent for new installations if more than 3.5
gigawatts are forecast for this year, according to a plan forged
last month by Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen and
executives in the solar industry.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
