Yum! Brands Inc., the owner of
restaurant chains Taco Bell and KFC, reported fourth-quarter
profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates as same-store sales
rose in  China .  Earnings excluding some items for the period ended Dec. 25
were 63 cents a share, the Louisville, Kentucky-based company
said today in a statement. The average of 18 estimates compiled
by Bloomberg was 60 cents a share.  Yum, with about half of its locations outside the U.S.,
said sales at stores open at least 12 months grew 8 percent in
China, where the company has sought to sell to the middle class
with its KFC and  Pizza Hut  chains. Last year, about one-third of
total revenue came from China.  “Their brand name is very strong there and they’re taking
advantage of that by opening a lot of new stores,”  Jack Russo ,
an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in  St. Louis , said in a
telephone interview. He rates Yum shares “hold.” The company
added more than 400 KFC outlets in China last year.  Sales advanced 5.9 percent to $3.56 billion in the fourth
quarter, from $3.37 billion a year earlier. The average of 15
analyst estimates was $3.5 billion. The chain’s sales at stores
open at least a year increased 5 percent in the U.S.  Net income for the quarter rose 27 percent to $274 million,
or 56 cents a share, from $216 million, or 45 cents.  The company, led by David Novak, repeated its forecast for
earnings excluding some items of as much as $2.73 a share for
2011.  Shares Gain  Yum rose $1.16, or 2.4 percent, to $48.89 at 5:17 p.m.
after the close of regular New York Stock Exchange trading.
Earlier, the shares advanced 31 cents to $47.73 in NYSE
composite trading. They gained 33 percent in the past 12 months.  Last month, Yum put the Long John Silver’s and A&W All-
American Food restaurants on the block to focus on its business
in China. Wendy’s/Arby’s Group Inc. made a similar announcement
in January, saying it would explore a sale of its Arby’s brand.  Net income for 2010 rose 8.1 percent to $1.16 billion, or
$2.38 a share, from $1.07 billion, or $2.22, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
