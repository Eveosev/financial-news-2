  Egypt ’s unrest may spread to other
countries, including Algeria and Jordan, that have high
unemployment and less leeway to boost public spending because of
high debt and budget deficits, Standard & Poor’s said today.  The rating agency is “relatively confident” that Egypt
will pay its debt obligations, Kai Stukenbrock, director for
sovereign and international public finance ratings, said in an
interview in Dubai today.  There is a 50 percent chance that S&P will cut Egypt’s
credit rating further, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
