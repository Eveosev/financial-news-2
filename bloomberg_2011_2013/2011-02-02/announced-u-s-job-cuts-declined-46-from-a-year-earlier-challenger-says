Job cuts announced by U.S. employers
dropped in January, indicating the slowdown in firings in the
last half of 2010 is continuing this year.  Planned firings fell 46 percent to 38,519 last month from
71,482 in January 2010, according to Chicago-based Challenger,
Gray & Christmas Inc. It marked the fewest job cuts for any
January since record-keeping began in 1993. The year-over-year
decrease was the biggest since August.  “What made this January figure so unusual is that it was
so low,” John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of
Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. “Even in the
1990s, when annual job cuts were relatively low, January still
averaged more than 74,000 job cuts.”  While companies trim fewer workers from payrolls, they need
to step up the pace of hiring to further drive consumer
spending, the largest part of the economy. Federal Reserve
policy makers last month pledged to continue their $600 billion
stimulus as the  unemployment rate  holds above 9 percent.  Compared with December, which saw the fewest firings since
June 2000, job-cut announcements increased 20 percent. Because
the figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal effects, economists
prefer to focus on year-over-year changes rather than monthly
numbers.  Government and non-profit agencies led the January job cuts
with 6,450 announced reductions, according to Challenger. Retail
companies had the next-largest number of cuts, with 5,755.  New York  New York, the third most-populous U.S. state, could fire as
many as 9,800 workers after Governor  Andrew Cuomo  proposed
cutting local school funding by 7.3 percent and reducing
Medicaid spending by almost $3 billion in a budget that seeks to
close a $10 billion deficit. Cuomo isn’t seeking new taxes or
borrowing to close the deficit.  Aid to 700 school districts,  New York ’s largest expense,
would be cut by $1.5 billion to $19.4 billion in the fiscal year
beginning April 1, according to the governor.  “The government and non-profit sector has, or course,
struggled immensely throughout the recession and into the
recovery,” Challenger said. “Unfortunately, there are no signs
of a turnaround in 2011.”  California led all states with 4,848 announced job cuts,
followed by  Illinois  with 4,078.  Today’s report also showed that employers announced plans
in January to hire 29,492 workers, up from 10,575 the prior
month. Retail and computer companies led the gains, planning to
add 10,925 and 6,740 positions, respectively.  Payrolls Forecast  Employers probably added 142,000 jobs in January as the
jobless rate rose to 9.5 percent from 9.4 percent, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
The Labor Department will release the figures Feb. 4.  The economy grew at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter of 2010 as  consumer spending  climbed by the most in more
than four years, a Commerce Department report showed last week.  “The economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate
that has been insufficient to bring about a significant
improvement in labor market conditions,” the Fed said in a
statement after its Jan. 25-26 policy meeting. “The
unemployment rate is elevated.”  Challenger’s data do not always correlate with figures on
payrolls or first-time jobless claims as reported by the
government. Many job cuts are carried out through attrition or
early retirement. Some employees whose jobs are eliminated find
work elsewhere in their companies and many announced staff
reductions never take place because business improves. The
totals also include foreign affiliates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
