The Obama administration will set the
first U.S. standard for perchlorate in drinking water, reversing
a Bush-era decision against regulating the chemical that may
impair the human thyroid.  The Environmental Protection Agency will propose a rule for
perchlorate, a toxic rocket-fuel ingredient used to make
fireworks and explosive devices, the EPA said today in an e-
mailed statement.  The EPA also said it will craft a rule to protect people
from as many as 16 chemicals found in drinking water that may
cause cancer. The agency under President  Barack Obama  set aside
about one-third, or $3.3 billion, of its proposed fiscal 2011
budget for drinking and wastewater projects, almost double the
total approved in the final year of the  Bush administration .
Bush’s EPA declined to establish rules for perchlorate.  “Exposure to perchlorate in drinking water is dangerous,
especially for pregnant women, infants and children, because it
can harm the body’s production of hormones necessary for mental
and physical development,” Senator  Barbara Boxer , a California
Democrat, said in a statement today. “I will do everything I
can to make sure this new protection moves forward.”  More than 4 percent of public U.S. water systems have
detected perchlorate and 5 million to 17 million people may
drink water containing the chemical, according to the EPA,
citing monitoring data. The agency said its has received almost
39,000 comments about regulating perchlorate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
