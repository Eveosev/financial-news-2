  New York ’s Metropolitan
Transportation Authority is reducing service indefinitely on its
Metro-North Railroad New Haven line beginning Feb. 7 as almost
half its snow-battered fleet awaits repairs.  Peak service on the New Haven line will be cut by about 10
percent as about 150 cars in a fleet of about 340 sit idle in
repair shops “in the midst of the most severe car shortage
we’ve ever had,” said Marjorie Anders, an agency spokeswoman.  Heavy snowfall that has hit the New York area since Dec.
26, when a blizzard dumped 20 inches (51 centimeters) on Central
Park, has pummeled the 40-year-old fleet, which “is just dying
faster than we can fix it,” Anders said in an interview.  The MTA, operator of the biggest U.S. mass-transit system,
plans to release more details of the revised schedule tomorrow,
Anders said. The New Haven line serves about 67,000 riders daily
and connects towns such as Greenwich,  Connecticut , and
Mamaroneck, New York, with  Manhattan ’s Grand Central Terminal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
