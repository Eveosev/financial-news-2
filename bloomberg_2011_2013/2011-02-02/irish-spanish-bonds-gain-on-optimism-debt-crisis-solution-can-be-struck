Irish bonds led a surge by securities
from  Europe ’s high-deficit countries as political leaders
prepared a pledge to defend the euro and bridge differences over
the mandate of the European Financial Stability Facility.  Yields on Irish 10-year bonds slid to the lowest in more
than a week, even as Standard & Poor’s cut the nation’s credit
rating. Portuguese bonds rose as borrowing costs fell at the
nation’s sale of short-term debt, while the Spanish 10-year
yield reached the lowest since Dec. 3. German two-year yields
were at the highest since August 2009 as data showed the fastest
producer-price growth in two years for the euro region.  “There’s definitely something afoot” from European policy
makers, said  Huw Worthington , a fixed-income strategist at
Barclays Plc in  London . “That’s bringing a positive tone to the
market and certainly helping confidence.”  The yield on the Irish 10-year bond fell 20 basis points to
8.8 percent at 5:45 p.m. in London. The price of the 5 percent
securities maturing in October 2020 rose 1.085, or 10.85 euros
per 1,000 euro ($1,380) face amount, to 75.73. The difference in
yield between 10-year Irish debt and German bunds narrowed 24
basis points to 5.56 percentage points.  Belgian 10-year bonds also rose, with the yield falling
nine basis points to 4.13 percent. The yield on Italian bonds of
a similar maturity declined 11 basis points to 4.54 percent. The
Greek yield slid 26 basis points to 10.79 percent.  EFSF Disagreement  Officials are meeting at the European Council in Brussels
on Feb. 4. Leaders preparing the pledge are aiming to keep
markets at bay until a late March deadline to resolve national
disagreements over rescue measures involving the EFSF, including
budget rules, rescue-loan rates and potential debt buybacks,
four officials involved in the talks said.    Germany  today ruled out allowing the 440 billion-euro EFSF
to fund bond buybacks from debt-strapped governments. A German
official briefing reporters said the fund lacks the legal
authority to purchase the outstanding debt to ease finances of
countries including  Greece .  Portuguese bonds rose, pushing yields down eight basis
points to 6.851 percent, as the nation auctioned 196-day and
350-day bills. Portugal’s borrowing costs dropped at the sale,
with the bills due in January 2012 issued at an average yield of
3.710 percent. That compares with a yield of 4.029 percent at
the previous auction, on Jan. 19.  “As today’s auction was an important market test for
Portugal, we expect the good result to reinforce the current
optimism about the periphery and about Portugal in the market,”  Chiara Cremonesi , a fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in
London, wrote after the sale.  Spanish Spread  Spanish debt surged, pushing the 10-year bond yield down 13
basis points to 5.1 percent. The extra yield investors demand to
hold 10-year Spanish  government bonds  instead of their German
counterparts shrank to 183 basis points. It earlier dropped to
180 basis points, the smallest gap since Nov. 3.  Spanish Deputy Finance Minister Jose Manuel Campa today
said the country will “never” need a bailout. He spoke on
Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with  Andrea Catherwood .  Statistics today showed registered unemployment in the
nation, which has Europe’s highest jobless rate, climbed the
most in almost two years in January.    Spain  plans to sell debt maturing 2013 and 2016 tomorrow.  France  will auction bonds due 2016, 2020, 2021 and 2023.  Irish Downgrade, Election  Irish debt remained higher even as its  credit rating  was
cut by S&P on costs to rescue the country’s banks. The rating
was lowered to A- from A, and may be cut further, S&P said.  The government yesterday said Ireland will hold a general
election on Feb. 25.  “Having confirmation of the election date is good because
government bondholders do not want political risk,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in
London. “The sooner the election comes, the sooner the
political risk can be put to one side.”  The cost of insuring European sovereign debt fell. Credit-
default swaps on Greece dropped 17 basis points to 803, swaps on
Ireland declined 2.5 basis points to 566 and swaps for  Italy 
decreased 6 basis points to 158 basis points, according to CMA.  Contracts on  Portugal  fell 10.5 basis points to 390 and
Spanish CDS’s were 2.5 basis points lower at 220.5 basis points,
CMA prices show.  Bunds, European Inflation  The yield on the German 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark
government security, rose four basis points to 3.26 percent, the
highest since Feb. 23. The two-year note fell, with the yield
rising eight basis points to 1.49 percent. That’s the most since
August 2009.  European producer prices rose at the quickest annual pace
in more than two years in December after energy costs surged,
adding to the  European Central Bank ’s inflation concerns.  Factory-gate prices in the euro region jumped 5.3 percent
from a year earlier, the most since October 2008, after
increasing 4.5 percent in November, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists forecast
a gain to 5.2 percent, the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey showed. Prices rose 0.8 percent from November.  Germany’s 10-year breakeven rate, a gauge of inflation
expectations derived from a yield gap between regular and index-
linked bonds, rose as high as 209 basis points, the most since
Bloomberg began collecting the data in August 2009.  Euribor futures fell, signaling traders increased bets on
higher borrowing costs. The implied yield on the contract
expiring in December gained five basis points to 1.94 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
