  Mitsubishi Electric Corp ., the
Japanese maker of factory equipment and home appliances, rose
the most in 1 1/2 years in Tokyo trading after the company
reported profit that exceeded analyst estimates.  The shares surged as much as 7 percent to 992 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest intraday gain since July 2009,
after the company reported third-quarter earnings. The benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose as much as 2 percent.  Sales of factory automation equipment rose 21 percent as
Mitsubishi Electric benefited from a recovery in demand for
machinery used in car manufacturing and flat-panel displays, the
company said today in a statement. Bookings for Japanese  machine
tools  have risen for 13 straight months as companies expand
factories and replace worn-out equipment, according to the
Tokyo-based Japan Machine Tool Builders Association.  The Tokyo-based company posted net income of 45.6 billion
yen ($560 million) in the three months through December, up from
23 billion yen a year earlier, Mitsubishi Electric said in a
statement. The results compares with the average of five analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg for profit of 27.1 billion yen.  Mitsubishi Electric left its full-year forecast unchanged,
predicting net income of 115 billion yen after posting 116.9
billion yen during the first nine months. Analysts surveyed
before todayâ€™s announcement predicted earnings of 31.1 billion
yen in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
