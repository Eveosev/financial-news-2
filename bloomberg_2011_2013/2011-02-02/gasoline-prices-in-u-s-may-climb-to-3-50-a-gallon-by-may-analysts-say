U.S. gasoline at the pump may rise 13
percent by May as crude oil in New York tops $100 a barrel and a
recovering economy boosts fuel demand, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The highest price for regular gasoline this year will be
$3.50 a gallon, based on the median estimate of 14 analysts. The
motor fuel hasn’t reached that level since Oct. 6, 2008,
according to  AAA , the nation’s largest motoring organization.  “Gasoline prices could spike to $3.40 to $3.50,” said
Amrita Sen, a commodity analyst at  Barclays Capital  in  London .
“We’re impressed at how well demand has held up at these
prices. If crude goes up, it would be difficult to see gasoline
not go up.”  New York oil may top $100 a barrel this year, Barclays and
other analysts say, as global demand growth accelerates. U.S.
fuel use over the past four weeks was 1.6 percent higher than a
year earlier, according to the Energy Department. U.S. gross
domestic product may grow 3.1 percent in 2011, according to the
median of 71 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  China , the
world’s largest energy consumer, may expand 9.5 percent.  March-delivery crude futures settled at $90.77 a barrel
yesterday on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , while March-
delivery gasoline closed at $2.5194 a gallon. Brent oil on ICE
Futures  Europe  rose above $100 on Jan. 31 for the first time
since September 2008.  Worldwide oil demand may grow in 2011 by as much as 1.8
million barrels a day, or 2 percent, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister
Ali al-Naimi said in a speech in Riyadh Jan. 24.  Record High  Pump prices reached a record high of $4.114 a gallon on
July 15, 2008, four days after the front-month crude oil
contract touched an intraday record $147.27 a barrel.  Regular gasoline, averaged nationwide, was $3.108 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website. Prices reached $3.117 Jan.
20. The last time crude in New York was over $100 a barrel, the
price at the pump was $3.633 a gallon.  “If you follow the pattern of a seasonal rally in the
spring, then we could reach $3.50,” said  Tom Knight , vice
president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in
Texarkana,  Texas . “The question now is whether $4 is a more
realistic target.”  The Energy Department projects retail gasoline will average
$3.17 a gallon this year, with as much as a 10 percent chance of
reaching $4 in August and September.  “The key uncertainty would be the rate of world economic
growth,” said  Tancred Lidderdale , senior economist at EIA.
“The key issue, given expectations in growth in world
consumption and relatively low-growth in non-OPEC supply, is the
response of OPEC.”  Excess Capacity  Gasoline’s 2011 price gain may be constrained by excess
refining capacity in the U.S., a fact that’s been obscured as
unplanned pipeline and refinery shutdowns in the fourth quarter
of 2010 caused tightness, said  Francisco Blanch , head of
commodity research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.  “I don’t think we hit record prices in 2011, we have too
much spare capacity for that to happen,” Blanch said.  U.S. refineries operated at 81.8 percent of capacity in the
week ended Jan. 21, according to the Energy Department, a 10-
month low.    Valero Energy Corp ., the largest independent U.S. refiner,
said Jan. 26 that its 14 North American refineries will operate
at 83 percent to 89 percent of capacity this quarter as some
units undergo seasonal maintenance.  ‘Adequate’ Inventories  Pump prices may retreat at the $3.50 to $3.70 level because
continued high unemployment and underemployment would reduce
demand, said  Harry Tchilinguirian , London-based head of
commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA.  “The U.S. consumer is not in a position to absorb a rise
like in 2008 because unemployment is much higher,” he said.
Tchilinguirian said spare production capacity in OPEC countries
and the U.S. and imports from Europe, and potentially  Asia , will
keep a rein on crude and gasoline prices.  The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 9.4 percent in December
from 9.8 percent a month earlier and 5.8 percent in July 2008,
the Labor Department reported Jan. 7. Applications for jobless
benefits increased by 51,000 to 454,000 in the week ended Jan.
22, according to Labor Department figures.  The  Federal Reserve  left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 0.25 percent Jan, 26, citing high unemployment and
low inflation. Officials downplayed increases in food and fuel
costs, saying that “although commodity prices have risen,
longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and
measures of underlying inflation have been trending downward.”  ‘Competitive Pressures’  While prices of food, metals and petroleum-related products
have risen, companies are having difficulty passing along those
costs to customers “because of competitive pressures,” the
Federal Reserve said in its Jan. 12 Beige Book regional business
survey.  The inflation gauge watched by the Fed, which excludes food
and energy costs, showed a 0.8 percent increase in the 12 months
through November. Central bank officials prefer that the
inflation rate range from 1.6 percent to 2 percent.  “The gasoline price can be squeezed higher because it’s
still not a dramatic percentage of income,” Paul Sankey, an oil
analyst with Deutsche Bank in  New York , said in an interview.
“People are also more price tolerant after the previous price
spike so the barometer is higher until drivers start yelling.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
