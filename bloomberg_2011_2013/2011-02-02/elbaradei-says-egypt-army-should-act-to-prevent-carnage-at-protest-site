Egyptian opposition campaigner  Mohamed ElBaradei , former head of the United Nations atomic
agency, said the army should be deployed to end clashes in
central Cairo’s Tahrir Square between anti-government protesters
and people loyal to President  Hosni Mubarak .  ElBaradei, speaking in an interview on BBC Radio 4’s “The
World at One” program, said today’s outbreak of violence in the
capital was the result of a “criminal regime” that “has to go
immediately.” He said the inaction of police was irresponsible
and that “thugs” were allowed by authorities to disrupt a
peaceful protest.  The 2005 Nobel Peace Prize winner said the status quo in
Egypt is “unsustainable” and that Mubarak must resign. He said
Mubarak’s concessions yesterday were “crumbs,” referring to
the president’s televised address in which he said he would step
down from his post in September rather than seeking re-election
in polling scheduled for then.  ElBaradei, 68, said he has no interest in holding any
political office in  Egypt , though he “won’t let the people
down” if he is asked to take a public role.  To contact the reporters on this story:
