The pound strengthened, extending its
third day of gains versus the dollar, after a report showed the
U.K. construction industry returned to growth in January.  Britainâ€™s currency advanced as much as 0.4 percent to
$1.6212 before trading at $1.6201 as of 9:40 a.m. in  London .  A gauge of building activity based on a survey of
purchasing managers rose to 53.7 from 49.1 in December, Markit
Economics Ltd. and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  said today in an e-mailed statement in London. The median
forecast of 11 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
reading of 49.5. A measure above 50 indicates expansion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
