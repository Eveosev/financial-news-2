  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA ,
reduced borrowing costs raising 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion)
of covered bonds amid confidence European leaders will agree on
a plan to stem the region’s debt crisis.    Spain ’s second-largest bank will price its sale of five-
year covered bonds to yield 200 basis points more than the
benchmark mid-swaps rate, said three people with direct
knowledge of the deal, who declined to be identified because
terms are private. BBVA reduced the indicated spread from 220
basis points to 225 earlier today, the people said.  European Union leaders meeting in Brussels on Feb. 4 are
expected to forge a plan to strengthen the EU’s bailout
mechanism as they seek to bridge differences over budget rules,
rescue-loan rates and bond buybacks. The Spanish 10-year bond
yield fell 14 basis points to 5.07 percent, the lowest since Nov
24, at 1:00 p.m. in  Madrid .  BBVA reduced its risk premium from 225 basis points on Jan.
4 when it raised 1.5 billion euros of three-year covered bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank’s fourth-
quarter net income rose to 939 million euros from 31 million
euros a year earlier, Bilbao-based BBVA said today in a filing
to regulators.  Covered bonds are backed by mortgages or public-sector
loans and are guaranteed by the issuer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
