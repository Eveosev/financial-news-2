Advent International Corp., a
private-equity company, has $2 billion to make acquisitions in  Brazil ’s retail industry and take advantage of growth in Latin
America’s largest economy, the company’s local head said.  “We’re looking at various companies in niche retail
areas,” Patrice Etlin, managing partner at Advent in Latin
America, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo yesterday.
Food and household-appliance retailers have gone through a
period of mergers and acquisitions, whereas there is still space
in specialist retail, including pharmacies and construction
materials, he said.  Brazilian retail sales, including cars and building
materials, grew 17 percent in the 12 months to November. Gross
domestic product will expand by 4.6 percent this year, according
to a central bank survey taken Jan. 28. Advent, based in  Boston ,
has invested in Brazil since the 1990s, in companies including
duty-free shop operator  Dufry Group  and clearinghouse Cetip SA -
Balcao Organizado de Ativos & Derivativos.  Growth in  consumer spending  is what most attracts Advent to
Brazilian retail, Etlin said. He said the level of expansion
more than compensates for an increase in asset prices due to
rising competition from investors and private-equity funds.  “Valuations have risen,” said Etlin. “The growth
counterbalances the higher price demanded for assets. We’re
chasing higher growth, so we can justify a higher entry price.”  Advent expects to invest in Brazil this year, Etlin said,
declining to give a time line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
