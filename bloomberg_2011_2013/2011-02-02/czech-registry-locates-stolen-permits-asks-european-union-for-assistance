Czech authorities said they located
1.36 million stolen carbon permits in Estonia,  Germany  and the
U.K. and asked the European Union to help bar them from re-
entering the market.  The European Commission, the EU regulator, suspended all 30
registries that keep tabs on carbon permits in the worldâ€™s
biggest emissions-trading system on Jan. 19. The move came after
the Brno-based trader Blackstone said 475,000 allowances were
missing from its account. CEZ, Czech biggest utility, announced
last week it lost 700.000 permits in the raids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
