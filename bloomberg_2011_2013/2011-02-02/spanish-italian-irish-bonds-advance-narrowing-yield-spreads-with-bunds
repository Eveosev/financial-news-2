Spanish, Italian and Irish government
bonds rose, reducing the additional yield investors demand to
hold the securities instead of benchmark German bunds.  Spanish 10-year bond yields fell 16 basis points to 5.05
percent as of 8:34 a.m. in  London . That narrowed the difference
in yield, or spread, with similar-maturity bunds to 184 basis
points, the least since Nov. 2.  Italian 10-year yields dropped 11 basis points to 4.53
percent, equivalent-maturity Irish bond yields fell 10 basis
points to 8.93 percent and Belgian 10-year yields slid 11 basis
points to 4.12 percent.  The yield on 10-year Portuguese bonds fell seven basis
points to 6.86 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
