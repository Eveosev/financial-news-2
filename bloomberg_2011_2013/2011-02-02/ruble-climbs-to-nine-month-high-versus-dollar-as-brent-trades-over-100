The ruble climbed to its strongest
since the end of April against the dollar as Brent crude oil
traded above $100 a barrel for a third day, luring investors to
the world’s largest energy exporter.    Russia ’s currency gained 0.6 percent to 29.4525 per dollar
by the 5 p.m. close of trading in Moscow, the strongest since
April 30. It added 0.3 percent to 34.4992 versus the target
dollar-euro basket used by the country’s central bank to control
swings in the currency that harm exporters’ competitiveness, the
strongest close since Jan. 18.  Brent, which underpins Russia’s Urals crude oil prices,
gained as much as 0.6 percent to $102.36 a barrel today. Oil,
along with natural gas, makes up about a quarter of Russia’s
economic output. Brent has gained 8 percent this year, helping
the ruble advance 1.8 percent against the basket, which has been
used by Bank Rossii since 2005 to manage the currency.  “Investors are selling dollars and buying rubles,”  Denis Korshilov , head of foreign exchange trading in Moscow at
Citigroup Inc. said by e-mail. “With Brent higher than $100 it
looks like some capital inflow is taking place.”  The ruble was little changed at 40.6675 per euro. The
basket rate is calculated by multiplying the dollar-ruble rate
by 0.55, the euro-ruble rate by 0.45, then adding them together.  Bank Rossii buys and sells foreign currency to keep the
ruble within a so-called “floating corridor” against the
basket. The corridor has spanned 33 to 37 versus the basket
since the beginning of the year, First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  told reporters in Moscow yesterday. The central bank
purchased “several hundred million dollars” to moderate the
ruble’s gains in January, Ulyukayev said.  ‘Upside Potential’  The ruble has further “upside potential” should oil
prices continue to climb,  Vladimir Osakovsky , chief Russia
economist for UniCredit SpA in Moscow, wrote in a research note
e-mailed today. “Any further ruble appreciation would require
still more expansion of the trade and current-account
surpluses,” the note said.  Ruble-denominated government debt due August 2016 was
little changed at 7.61 percent. The yield on sovereign dollar
bonds maturing in 2020 fell for a third day, losing 8 basis
points to 5.04 percent. Dollar debt due 2015 also rose, with the
yield declining 11 basis points to 3.53 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
