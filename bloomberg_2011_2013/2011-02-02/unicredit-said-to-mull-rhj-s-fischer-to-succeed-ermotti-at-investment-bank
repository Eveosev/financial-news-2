  UniCredit SpA  approached  RHJ
International  SA Chief Executive Officer Leonhard Fischer to
gauge his interest in succeeding  Sergio Ermotti  as head of
corporate and investment banking, two people with knowledge of
the matter said.  Fischer, 48, a former head of Dresdner Kleinwort
Wasserstein, is among three candidates Milan-based UniCredit
identified for the position, said the people, who requested
anonymity because the talks are private. He’s unlikely to take
the job, one of the people said.  UniCredit also spoke with Jean-Pierre Mustier, 50, the
former Societe Generale SA investment-banking chief, according
to three people. No decision has been made, they said.  UniCredit, Italy’s biggest bank, is seeking to replace
Ermotti, 50, who stepped down in October after a management
shakeup, and has since joined  UBS AG . Milan-based UniCredit is
reviewing its strategy in some markets and divisions after
Federico Ghizzoni replaced Alessandro Profumo as CEO.  A spokesman for UniCredit declined to comment. Fischer
didn’t return phone calls and an e-mail to his office, while
Mustier declined to comment.  UniCredit will name a new head of its corporate- and
investment-banking division in “weeks or days,” picking from a
“shortlist of high-profile external candidates,” Ghizzoni said
on Jan. 24.  To contact the reporters on this story:
