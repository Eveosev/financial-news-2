  BP Plc ’s southern African unit plans
to cut jobs amid a reorganization to consolidate its supply
position and invest in existing and profitable retail growth,
the company said in an e-mailed response to questions today.  “A limited number of jobs mainly in the company’s
Johannesburg and Cape Town offices will be impacted either in
the form of redefined roles, retrenchments or recruitments where
key posts for the reorganized business are vacant,” it said.
While it is still in talks with employees, less than 100 jobs
will be impacted, BP said.  The company plans to invest $100 million a year in new
distribution infrastructure and new or revamped sites, which
could generate about 7,000 jobs over the next two years, the
company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
