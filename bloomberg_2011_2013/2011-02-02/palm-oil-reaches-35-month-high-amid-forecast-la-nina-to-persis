  Palm oil  gained to the highest level
in 35 months on concern that a La Nina weather event that caused
flooding in Asia and drought in  South America  may persist for a
further four months.  April-delivery futures in  Kuala Lumpur  rose 2.3 percent to
end at 3,895 ringgit ($1,280) a metric ton. Earlier, the price
climbed as much as 2.7 percent to 3,910 ringgit, the highest
level since March 2008.  Malaysia ’s markets are opened for half a
day today and will close for a two-day Lunar New Year holiday
from tomorrow.  La Nina, which started in June and usually lasts for nine
months or more, has led to above average rainfall in most parts
of Southeast  Asia , hindering harvests in Indonesia and Malaysia,
the top palm-oil producers. The weather event’s strength may
decrease during the next four months, the  Malaysian
Meteorological Department  said in response to questions,
supporting forecasts by the  World Meteorological Organization .  “The La Nina is still on going and although it’s probably
passed its peak, it’s still quite strong,” said  Ben Santoso , an
analyst at DBS Vickers Securities (Singapore) Pte. “Rains are
not over yet.”  Climate indicators continue to indicate a strong, mature La
Nina, although there are clear signs the event has passed its
peak, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology  said  today.  Flooding in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, a major
palm oil-producing state, caused prices to surge to the most in
more than two months on Jan. 31. Still, the Malaysian weather
office yesterday downgraded its heavy rainfall warning for the
state, according to its website.  ‘Back to Normal’  Excessive rain “may only have a short-term impact, as we
note that the floods have already been cleared since then and
harvesting activities should therefore be back to normal,” RHB
Research Institute Sdn. said in a report today.  La Nina caused droughts in  Argentina , affecting soybean
crops in the world’s third-largest producer.  March-delivery soybeans gained as much as 0.5 percent to
$14.4575 a bushel and were at $14.4225 at 1:31 p.m. Soybean oil
for delivery in the same month climbed as much as 0.5 percent to
59.01 cents a pound.  September-delivery palm oil on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange rose 0.5 percent to 9,908 yuan ($1,505) a ton in  Shanghai  yesterday. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month
rose 0.3 percent to 10,628 yuan at the close yesterday. China’s
markets are closed from Feb. 2-8 for Lunar New year holidays.  CME Group Inc.’s April palm-oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, rose 1.9 percent to $1,279.75 a ton
at 1 p.m. in  Singapore .  To contact the reporter on this story:
