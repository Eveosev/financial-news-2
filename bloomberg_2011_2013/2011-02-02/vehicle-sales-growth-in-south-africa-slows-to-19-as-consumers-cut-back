South African vehicle sales rose at a
slower pace in January than the previous month as consumers
eased purchases, an industry group said.  Vehicle sales increased an annual 19 percent to 45,135 last
month, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of  South Africa  said in a statement on its website today. Sales
surged 30 percent in both November and December.  The  Reserve Bank  has cut its benchmark interest rate to a
30-year low of 5.5 percent to help boost  consumer spending  in  Africa ’s biggest economy. The recovery in vehicle sales, coupled
with a rebound in export demand, helped to spur manufacturing
output, which accounts for 15 percent of the economy.  “At this stage, the outlook for 2011 in terms of total
industry sales remains reasonably positive,” the association
said. “New vehicle sales over the medium term will remain a
function of the performance of the South African economy.”  The association estimates that domestic production will
probably climb 18 percent to 555,000 vehicles in 2011, compared
with last year.  Carmakers including Volkswagen AG, General Motors Co. and
Toyota Motor Corp. operate plants in South Africa.  Daimler AG 
said on Dec. 7 it will invest an additional 2 billion rand ($282
million) at its Mercedes-Benz plant on South Africa’s southeast
coast to build the C-Class model from 2014.  Exports increased an annual 12 percent to 10,186 in
January, with most car plants only resuming operations in the
middle of January after the year-end holidays, the association
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
