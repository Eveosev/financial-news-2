The rand weakened for the first day
in three, erasing earlier gains, on speculation  South Africa ’s
central bank and importers were boosting purchases of foreign
currency.  The rand depreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 7.1617 per
dollar and traded 0.4 percent down at 7.1579 as of 4:18 p.m. in
Johannesburg. Earlier it advanced to as strong as 7.0915.  The  South African Reserve Bank  and the  Finance Ministry 
have both said the rand is overvalued following its 42 percent
gain in the last two years, which labor unions and manufacturers
argue is hurting exports and hampering economic growth. Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said in his mid-term budget speech in
October that the government would use some of its tax receipts,
which were higher than expected, to help boost foreign-currency
purchases to weaken the rand.  “The SARB has once again been in the market,” said
Warrick Butler, a trader at Johannesburg-based Standard Bank
Group Ltd.,  Africa ’s biggest lender. “There’s also a natural
demand for dollars at this time of the year as factories and
businesses begin to put in their import orders for the year
ahead.”  South Africa’s gross gold and foreign currency reserves
increased 1.1 percent to $43.8 billion in December, the  Reserve
Bank  said on Jan. 7. Reserves data for January will be released
at 8 a.m. tomorrow.  Government bonds advanced for a third day, with the
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 climbing 15
cents to 121.75 rand. The yield on the bond declined 4 basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.79 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
