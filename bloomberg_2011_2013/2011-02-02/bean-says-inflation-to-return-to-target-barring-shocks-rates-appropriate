Bank of England Deputy Governor
Charles Bean said U.K. inflation will slow to the bank’s 2
percent target, barring any shocks to prices.  “We would expect, providing there aren’t further shocks,
that inflation will come back down towards the target,” he said
in an interview with the Western Mail newspaper published today
on its website.  He said growth in emerging markets “may mean a tendency
for commodity prices to continue to rise” though the rate of
growth may slow. The bank may have to offset price pressures
that are external to the U.K. “by keeping domestically
generated inflation lower,” he said.  A rate increase “in response to a spike in oil prices that
we think is likely to persist and inflation is becoming embedded
that is not a nice reason to raise  interest rates , but we would
have to do it,” he said.  He said policy makers were right to keep the key rate at a
record low given that the recovery “is still relatively
fragile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
