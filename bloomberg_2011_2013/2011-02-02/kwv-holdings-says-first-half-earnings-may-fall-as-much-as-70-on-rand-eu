KWV Holdings Ltd. said earnings per
share in the six months through December may decline as much as
70 percent because of the stronger rand and “poor” trading
conditions in the European Union, which is impacting on foreign
sales.  Headline earnings per share for continuing operations may
drop as much as 85 percent, the company said in a statement
published in the Johannesburg-based Business Day newspaper
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
