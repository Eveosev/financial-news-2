  Morgan Stanley  denied a report by
Mint that it has been hired by Spanish wind-turbine manufacturer
Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA to explore the possibility of
acquiring wind-power assets in India.  “We deny that Morgan Stanley’s been hired by Gamesa,”
spokesman  Michael Wang  said by telephone from London. “The
report isn’t true.”  The Mint report cited two people, including an executive at
the local unit of the New York-based firm, whom it didn’t
identify by name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
