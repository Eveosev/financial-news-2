Poland’s five-year bonds rallied
after the  Finance Ministry  met 30 percent of investors’ demand
for the debt in an exchange auction today.  The yield on notes maturing in April 2016 dropped 10 basis
points to 5.78 percent as of 2:10 p.m. in Warsaw, heading for
the lowest level in a week.  The Finance Ministry swapped 1.6 billion zloty ($564
million) of five-year bonds for debt maturing in May and July
this year at today’s exchange auction, it said in an e-mailed
statement. Investors’ demand reached 5.36 billion zloty,
according to the statement.  “The ministry rejected a lot of bids which shows that they
are feeling strong,” Arkadiusz Urbanski, a fixed-income analyst
at Bank Pekao SA, said by phone from Warsaw. “Investors have
overplayed their hand thinking they will force the ministry to
sell at any price. This should help sentiment.”  Yields on Polish five-year debt climbed last month the most
since February 2009 as the central bank raised its main interest
rate from a record-low 3.5 percent and signaled it may tighten
policy further to bring inflation back to its 2.5 percent
target.  Fitch Ratings  said on Jan. 26 the trend in the country’s
public finances is “unsustainable” after the  budget deficit 
increased almost four-fold from 2007 through 2009.  Poland covered 18 percent of its 2011 gross borrowing needs
of 167.5 billion zloty at the end of January,  Piotr Marczak ,
head of the Finance Ministry’s debt department, said on Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
