Traders are snapping up bets that the
U.S. options market gauge known as the VIX will sink to a three-
year low after concern that equities will retreat fades.  The number of outstanding May 15 put options on the Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index jumped to 54,527 from
8,318 on Jan. 27 for the biggest one-day increase among all
contracts during the past week, according to data compiled by
Trade Alert LLC. The VIX, which measures the cost of insurance
against losses in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, fell to 17.63
yesterday. It surged the most since May on Jan. 28, rising to
20.04, as the S&P 500 posted the largest slump since August.  Equity market indicators showed U.S. stocks were poised for
a retreat on Jan. 28, when protests in  Egypt  drove down shares
around the world. The MSCI All-Country World Index recouped that
retreat yesterday after manufacturing expanded in the U.S. and  China . The VIX hasn’t closed below 15 since July 2007, a month
before BNP Paribas SA barred withdrawals from funds that owned
subprime loans and worsened the credit crisis.  “There’s been a clear shift in view that it’s at least
possible that the market will remain in a low-volatility
environment for a while,” said Jeremy Wien, head of VIX options
trading at Chicago-based Peak6 Capital Management. “You don’t
normally see people buy way out-of-the-money puts in VIX in such
big size.”  Peak in May  Investors are betting on a lower VIX as the S&P 500’s
historic volatility, a measure of past stock swings, remains
near the lowest level in at least a decade, reducing options
prices. Buyers of contracts that profit most if the VIX falls to
15 are wagering that the index will slip to a level 26 percent
below its 21-year average of 20.38, and that it will drop by
more than two-thirds from last year’s peak of 45.79 in May.  The VIX measures investor expectations for market swings
over the next 30 days using a formula that incorporates the
implied volatility, a key gauge of options prices, for S&P 500
contracts that are one or two months from expiration.  The options index fell 1.9 percent to 17.30 at 4:15 p.m.  New York  time today.  May 18 puts had the second-biggest one-day increase,
according to Trade Alert, jumping by 42,388 contracts, followed
by April 15 puts, which grew by 41,057 contracts. Puts accounted
for 7 of the 10 biggest gains.  Positive on Market  “This is a bearish bet on volatility, which could be
viewed as a positive bet on the marketplace,” said Dominic Salvino, a specialist at Group One Trading, the primary market
maker for VIX options. “If the market goes up, you’d see
volatility coming in -- that’s what this position is hoping
for.”  Total open interest for VIX puts increased 33 percent to
1.76 million in the week ended Jan. 31. That boosted the ratio
of outstanding puts to calls to 0.55, up from a nine-month low
of 0.45 on Jan. 21. The ratio surged 12 percent, the most in
four months, on Jan. 28.  The VIX fell to a three-year low of 15.45 on Dec. 22 as the
S&P 500 moved in its narrowest range since April 2007 and rose
for a fifth day, reaching a two-year high. The stock benchmark’s
21-day historic volatility, a gauge of past price swings, has
fallen to 11.56 from 86.53 in November 2008 and dropped to 4.64
on Dec. 31, the lowest in at least a decade.  Hedging Stocks  Short sellers may be buying VIX puts to reduce their risk
from losing on bets that the stock market will retreat,
according to Joshua Parker, who oversees $360 million in options
and stocks at Gargoyle Asset Management LLC in Englewood,  New
Jersey . Short sellers borrow stocks and sell them in the hope of
profiting by repurchasing the securities later at a lower price
and returning them to the holder.  “Since the VIX moves in the opposite direction of the
market, the buyers could be hedging their short positions,”
Parker said. “The market’s being driven by people wanting to
buy those puts.”  Bearish bets against S&P 500 companies rose last month for
the first time since September as short sellers increased
speculation stocks may decline after the benchmark gauge soared
to the highest level since August 2008. The proportion of S&P
500 shares available for trading -- or float -- that was sold
short on Jan. 14 rose to 3.99 percent, up from 3.93 percent two
weeks before, according to data compiled by U.S. exchanges and
Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 rose 13 percent in 2010, bringing the advance
since March 2009 to 86 percent, the biggest rally for a
comparable period since 1955, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg and S&P. The benchmark equity index posted the largest
gain for consecutive years since 1999. The index climbed 2.3
percent in January after more than 70 percent of S&P 500
companies beat quarterly profit forecast.  “This market still has the momentum to the upside,” said
Joseph Cusick, senior market analyst at OptionsXpress Holdings
Inc., a Chicago-based online brokerage. “The fundamentals are
still very strong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
