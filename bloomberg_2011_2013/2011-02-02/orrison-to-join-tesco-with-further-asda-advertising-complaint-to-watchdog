William Morrison Supermarkets Plc,
the U.K.’s fourth-largest supermarket chain, said it plans to
follow  Tesco Plc  and complain about new advertisements by Asda,
the grocery chain owned by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc .  The Advertising Standards Authority said today that an
earlier Asda campaign promising cheaper prices than its major
competitors was misleading and told the retailer not to repeat
the ads in their current form. Asda started running new ads on
Jan. 31, promising to be cheaper by 10 percent.  “Morrison will be making further challenges to the ASA on
the Asda adverts,” Morrison spokesman Richard Taylor said by
phone in London today. “We will be focusing particularly on the
individual details of the ads going forward, challenging
specific claims that they make,” he said. Tesco has already
lodged a complaint with the advertising watchdog, spokesman
Trevor Datson said.  The earlier campaign began last April. The latest Asda
 advertisements  guarantee shopping will be 10 percent cheaper at
Asda compared with rivals such as Morrison, J Sainsbury Plc and
Tesco or it will refund the difference.  The ruling the ASA released today upheld several complaints
by Morrison and Tesco about Asda’s earlier TV and press
campaign.  Asda said it was “delighted,” noting that five of nine
complaints weren’t upheld by the ASA. It said the price
guarantee is “one of the easiest and best ways for shoppers to
compare the cost of their groceries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
