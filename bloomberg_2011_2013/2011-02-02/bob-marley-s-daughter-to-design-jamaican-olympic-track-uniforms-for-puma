The daughter of late reggae singer  Bob Marley  will design Jamaica’s track and field uniforms for
the 2012 Olympics, German sporting-goods maker Puma AG said.  Cedella Marley , the singer’s eldest daughter, also will
design the country’s podium and ceremony uniforms for the London
Games, Puma said in a statement on its  website  today.  “I can’t think of a better person to design our Olympics
outfits than Cedella,” said  Usain Bolt , the world-record holder
in the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints. “She’s a great designer
but also carries on the spirit of our nation.”  The uniforms will be worn first during the  Track and Field
World Championship  in August in  South Korea , the company said.  Europe’s second-largest sporting-goods maker extended a
sponsorship contract with Bolt in August until the end of 2013,
making him the world’s most highly sponsored runner, the company
said. A month later, the company said its “Bolt Collection”
was sold out worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
