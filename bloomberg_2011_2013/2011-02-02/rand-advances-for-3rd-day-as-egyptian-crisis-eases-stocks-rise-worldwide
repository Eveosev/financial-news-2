  South Africa ’s rand strengthened for
a third day against the dollar on signs Egypt’s political crisis
may ease after President  Hosni Mubarak  said he won’t seek a new
term, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The rand appreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 7.0915 per
dollar and traded 0.2 percent stronger at 7.11128 by 111:16 a.m.
in Johannesburg. Against the euro, the rand added 0.2 percent to
9.8300, snapping a three-day slide.  Egyptian President Mubarak said he will step down following
presidential elections in September after almost 30 years of
autocratic rule, according to a televised statement late
yesterday. The country’s Finance Minister, Samir Radwan, said
the government was using “every possible facility” to ensure a
peaceful transition and that his focus was on preventing a
collapse of the economy.  “There seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel in  Egypt  and that’s causing an improvement in sentiment towards
emerging markets,” Ion de Vleeschauwer, chief dealer at  Bidvest
Bank  in Johannesburg, which runs South Africa’s largest chain of
moneychangers, said by telephone. “Stock markets globally are
also having a nice bounce, which combined with a weaker dollar,
is helping the local currency a bit.”  Stocks rallied across the world as improving company
earnings from  Asia  to Europe reassured investors that the global
economic recovery is intact. The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index gained
for a second day while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index climbed
0.7 percent.  South African  government bonds  rose for a third day, with
the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 climbing
15 cents to 121.75 rand. The yield on the bond declined 4 basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.79 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
