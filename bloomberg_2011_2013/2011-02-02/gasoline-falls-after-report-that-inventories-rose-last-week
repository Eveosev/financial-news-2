Gasoline widened losses after the
Energy Department reported that inventories jumped last week to
the most since 1993 on lower demand and higher imports.  Futures sank as stockpiles rose 6.15 million barrels to
236.2 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 28, the largest
total since March 1993. Demand slipped to the lowest level since
February 2010 and imports of the motor fuel increased to a five-
month high.  “The yellow lights are flashing regarding demand,” said  David Pursell , a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
LLC in Houston. “We have gasoline prices that are high and the
6 million build is pretty stout. We’re a lot more nervous than
we were a few weeks ago about demand and price.”  Gasoline for March delivery dropped 2.41 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.4953 a gallon at 12:52 p.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Prices touched $2.4873 after the report’s
10:30 a.m. release in  Washington .  Supplies have risen for five consecutive weeks. Gasoline
was down before the report on speculation that winter storms are
reducing demand for motor fuel.  “We’re expecting plentiful supplies for the near term,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  The gasoline crack spread, based on March contracts,
narrowed 67 cents to $14.38 a barrel.  Imports of gasoline rose 529,000 barrels to an average 1.17
million barrels a day, the most since Aug. 20.  “We must be attracting arbitrage barrels,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in
Wakefield,  Massachusetts .  Gasoline Demand  Gasoline demand, measured by deliveries to wholesalers, fell
1 percent to an average 8.55 million barrels a day, the fewest
since the week ended Feb. 12, 2010.  A winter  storm  blanketed Chicago with more than a foot of
snow and glazed New York City streets with ice as it grounded
thousands of flights, closed schools and curtailed rail services
across the U.S.  “Today’s report is bearish for gasoline and that’s not
especially surprising given the fact most of the east has been
snowed in by weather of some sort,” Cohan said.  The bulk of storm has moved out of the upper Midwest and
into the Northeast, where heavy snow is expected for the
mountains of  New Hampshire  and  Maine , according to the  National
Weather Service . Winter storm warnings are clustered in the six
New England states, as well as upstate New York, as blizzard
warnings linger in the Midwest.  Ice Storm  “This is a major classic synoptic storm ripping through the
country,” said Michael Schlacter, of Weather 2000 Inc. in New
York. “For the population centers this is one of the more
significant ice storms that I have seen in a while.”  Heating oil reversed a loss as stockpiles of distillates,
including heating oil and diesel, fell 1.58 million barrels to
164.1 million and demand increased 4.9 percent. Heating oil
inventories dropped 6.7 percent to 39.2 million, the lowest
level since May 2009.  “Heating oil is all about the weather,” Cohan said.  Heating oil for March delivery rose 0.61 cent to $2.7631.
Prices touched $2.7861 after the report, the highest intraday
price for the front-month contract since October 2008. The
heating oil crack spread, based on March contracts, gained 66
cents to $25.68 a barrel.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, gained
0.7 cent to $3.108 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  “Above $3, we start worrying about demand,” Pursell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
