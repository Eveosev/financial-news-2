Mortgage applications in the U.S.
rebounded last week from a two-year low.  The  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index of loan
applications rose 11 percent in the week ended Jan. 28 after
dropping 13 percent the prior period, figures from the
Washington-based group showed today. The previous reading, the
lowest since November 2008, was not adjusted to reflect a
shortened work schedule due to the Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday on Jan. 17, the group said.  The housing market is being held in check by an  unemployment rate  near a 26-year high, even as manufacturing and
consumer spending strengthen. Mounting foreclosures and
increasing borrowing costs may also depress the industry at the
center of the last recession.  “What little momentum we did have late last year is,
slowly but surely, slowing,” Leif Thomsen, chief executive
officer of Mortgage Master, a Walpole, Massachusetts-based
lender, said before the report. “We could see a very difficult
year for real estate.”  The group’s refinancing gauge rose 12 percent after
dropping 15 percent the prior week, the mortgage bankers’ group
said. The purchase applications index advanced 9.5 percent
following an 8.7 percent drop that left it at the lowest level
in three months.  The average rate on a 30-year fixed loan rose to 4.81
percent last week from 4.80 percent the prior week. The rate
reached 4.21 percent in October, the lowest since the group’s
records began in 1990.  Monthly Payments  At the current 30-year rate, monthly payments for each
$100,000 of a loan would be $525.27 or about $12 less than the
same week the prior year, when the rate was 5.01 percent.  The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage increased to
4.13 percent from 4.12 percent.  The share of applicants seeking to refinance a loan fell to
69.3 percent last week from 70.3 percent the prior week.  “We had a fantastic run for almost two years with
refinancing being a large percentage of all the applications,”
said Thomsen. “With rates having gone up a bit, most of the
people who can and wanted to refinance have done so by now.”  Demand for traditional prime mortgages weakened in the
final three months of last year at 32 percent of banks in the  Federal Reserve ’s quarterly  survey  of senior loan officers
released this week. Sixty-two percent of respondents said demand
remained the same.  Record-Low Sales  With sales of new homes at a record low and prices still
falling, housing continues to struggle while other parts of the
economy recover. Spending on new-home construction decreased 4.1
percent in December, according to a report released yesterday by
the Commerce Department.  Residential real-estate prices dropped in November by 1.6
percent from a year earlier, the biggest annual decline in
almost a year, the S&P/Case-Shiller index of home values in 20
cities showed last week.  For all of 2010, new-home sales in the U.S. fell 14 percent
from the prior year to 321,000, the fewest in data going back to
1963, according to Commerce Department figures.  D.R. Horton Inc., the second-largest U.S. homebuilder by
stock-market value, last week reported a fiscal first-quarter
loss that was wider than analysts expected as revenue dropped
from a year earlier.  “I think 2011 will be a marginal weak year in the
homebuilding industry,” Chief Executive Officer Donald Tomnitz
said during a conference call on Jan. 27. “Our goal is still to
be profitable in 2011 and we’re going to struggle more in ‘11
than we did in ‘10 to be profitable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
