  Valero Energy Corp . shut a crude unit
and a coker for 51 days of planned work at the Port Arthur
refinery in Texas, Bill Day, a company spokesman, said.  The turnaround was delayed for several weeks because of
difficulty getting a crane large enough to replace the six drums
on the coker, people with knowledge of the project said last
month. They declined to be identified because they arenâ€™t
authorized to speak for the refinery.  Day, based in  San Antonio , reported the shutdown in an e-
mail.  Cokers process heavy fuel oil into distillates, including
heating oil and diesel, and gasoline.  The coker has a capacity of 100,000 barrels a day and the
crude unit has a daily capacity of 250,000. The refinery has a
capacity of 310,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
