Most European stocks advanced after
the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 12,000 for
the first time since June 2008. Asian shares also rallied, while
U.S. futures were little changed.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.2 percent to
284.66 at 8:04 a.m. in London, as more than two companies
advanced for every one that fell.  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc 
surged 3.7 percent after saying volumes rose. Gains were limited
as Electrolux AB tumbled 5.4 percent and  Roche Holding AG  slid
2.4 percent after reporting earnings.  Futures on the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index were unchanged
at 1,302.7, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.3
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
