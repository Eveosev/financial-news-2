Ficosa International Ltd., a closely
held manufacturer of automotive products, will expand into
renewable energy and energy-efficiency systems, the Barcelona-
based company said today in an electronic statement. The
multinational research and development group founded in 1949
will branch out into energy-saving products for aerospace,
railways, health technology and renewable energy, making use of
the 60,000 square-meter (15-acre) factory it recently bought
from Sony Corp. in Viladecavalls, near Barcelona.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
