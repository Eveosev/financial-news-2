Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA,  Spain ’s biggest wind-turbine maker, is considering options for
its plants in the Galicia and Cantabria regions after failing to
sell a unit in its home market in almost two years.  The company is studying what to do with the factories and
has no specific deadline, a spokeswoman for Gamesa said by
phone, asking not to be named in line with company policy.  The Zamudio, Spain-based manufacturer hasn’t yet decided to
close any more plants besides the one it already shut in the
north, she added, after newspaper  Cinco Dias  newspaper said
today it’s considering closing the two plants.  The report cited Chief Executive Officer Jorge Calvet, who
commented in a briefing about Gamesa´s increasing focus abroad
and lack of sales in Spain.  "It’s not because we’re incapable" of selling windmills in
Spain, he said. "In other nations we compete successfully with
General Electric and Siemens. It´s because of the jumble,
confusion and lack of industrial policy at the national level"
that’s depressing domestic sales, he said, according to a
statement of his remarks yesterday.  Gamesa shares climbed 1.3 percent to 5.69 euros as of 11:32
a.m. in  Madrid , valuing the company at 1.4 billion
euros ($1.9 billion). That compares with a 0.8 percent gain in
the WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
