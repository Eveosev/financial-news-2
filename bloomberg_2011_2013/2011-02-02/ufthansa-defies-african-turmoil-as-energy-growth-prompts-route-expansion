  Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Air France-KLM
Group and British Airways are defying political turmoil in
Africa and expanding there as a growing oil-and-gas business
swells the continent’s travel market.  From  Germany , Lufthansa added flights to the Republic of
Congo in November, while its U.K.-based  BMI unit  began services
to the Libyan capital, Tripoli, in December and announced routes
this week to Marrakech and Casablanca in Morocco. Air France
plans to add  Sierra Leone , Liberia and  Libya  later this year.  Lufthansa predicts  air-travel demand  in Africa will
increase an average 6 percent annually until 2025, helped by a
burgeoning raw-material industry and a growing middle class. The
airlines are undeterred by unrest that caused foreigners to flee
anti-government protests in Egypt and clashes that left hundreds
dead after a disputed election in the Ivory Coast.  “The risk of political instability is higher than in
developed countries, but the prospects of strong margins on
these routes outweigh that concern,” said Frank Skodzik, an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “Many of the markets
used to be monopolies with exclusive rights for one carrier, and
that’s very attractive for a newcomer airline.”  Bilateral Accords  African governments are extending bilateral agreements on
air-traffic rights, which as a post-colonial legacy tended to
favor Air France and British Airways, to other nations. That’s
helping Cologne-based Lufthansa, Europe’s second-biggest carrier
after  Air France-KLM , add routes that are more profitable than
those in European markets.  Lufthansa’s main brand last year reported an 11 percent
increase in African and Middle Eastern traffic, measured by
passengers times kilometers flown. The carrier’s market share in
the region topped 24 percent in November, compared with about 17
percent in 2002.  Europe is the main gateway to Africa, with flights between
the two continents accounting for 3.2 percent of all traffic in
2009, according to  the International Air Transport Association .
That compares with 1 percent for Africa-Middle East connections
and 0.4 percent between Africa and  Asia .  Cairo Gunfire  International traffic in Africa jumped 9.8 percent last
year, outstripping growth of 3.9 percent in  Europe  and 5.5
percent for North America, the Montreal-based  Airports Council
International  said this week.  Gunfire erupted in Cairo’s Tahrir Square early today as
supporters of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak battled with
demonstrators demanding an immediate end to his 30-year rule.
The UN has said as many as 300 people have died in a week of
demonstrations that roiled international stock, bond and oil
markets and followed a revolt in Tunisia that ousted President
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali Jan. 14.  Air France-KLM added Kigali, Rwanda and Bata in Equatorial
Guinea to its winter schedule and boosted capacity to Africa by
3.5 percent. It plans to fly to Freetown in Sierra Leone,
Liberia’s capital Monrovia, and Air  France  will begin serving
Tripoli in addition to KLM’s daily flights.  “It’s not just traffic to France from Africa -- Charles de
Gaulle airport attracts a big portion of all the traffic coming
out of Africa to the rest of the world, to the U.S. or to
Asia,” said  Yan Derocles , an analyst at Oddo Securities in
Paris. “Now this traffic is starting to interest other
carriers.”  Profit Margins  Africa generates as much as 400 million euros ($553
million) in operating profit for Air France-KLM annually,
Derocles estimates. The group reported a 1.3 billion-euro
operating loss in the year ended March 31.  Air France’s return flights on the 5,800-kilometer (3,600-
mile) route from Paris to  New York  in early April cost as little
as 470 euros, according to its website. The airline charges at
least 1,181 euros during the same period for tickets to Pointe-
Noire, Republic of Congo, 6,000 kilometers from Paris.  Lufthansa is focusing its network expansion on the oil-rich
region around the Gulf of Guinea. The airline’s core brand
offers three connections to  Nigeria  alone, and the group’s
destinations reach from Dakar in  Senegal  to Luanda in  Angola .  Including subsidiaries, Lufthansa also serves the North
African capitals and East African cities including Khartoum in
Sudan, Addis Ababa in Ethiopia and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  Star Alliance, SkyTeam  Lufthansa is also expanding its network via the Star
Alliance. South African Airways, based in Johannesburg, and
Cairo-based EgyptAir are set to be joined by Ethiopian Airlines
this year, providing alliance members with additional
connections in central and eastern  Africa . Air France-KLM’s
 SkyTeam  includes Nairobi-based Kenya Airways, while British
Airways’s Oneworld has no members on the continent.  A plan by Lufthansa’s three African partners to set up a
new airline to operate in central and west Africa would allow
the German carrier to concentrate on hubs like Lagos while the
local business would take over regional connections, spokesman
Boris Ogursky said.  Lufthansa shares slipped 0.4 percent to 15.34 euros as of
9:27 a.m. in Frankfurt. Air France-KLM lost 0.7 percent to 13.32
euros in Paris trading. International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA, the airline formed by the merger of British Airways
and  Spain ’s Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA, was down 0.5
percent at 257.8 pence in  London .  British Airways, Virgin    General Electric Co . plans to boost results at the oil and
gas unit by investing in research and plants, division chief
Claudi Santiago told Bloomberg News Jan. 31, citing Angola and
Nigeria as areas of interest. Nigeria was the fourth-biggest
source of U.S. crude oil and petroleum imports in the first
eleven months of 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy in
Washington D.C. said last week.  Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. added Accra in Ghana to its
flights to Lagos, Nairobi, Cape Town and Johannesburg in May.  Ghana  began pumping crude from the Jubilee Field on Dec. 15 and
will reach about 120,000 barrels a day by the middle of 2011.  Lufthansa, which includes Austrian Airlines and Swiss
International Airlines, serves 39 African destinations with 269
flights a week. That compares with 36 end points and 210 weekly
frequencies for Air France-KLM and 27 destinations with more
than 150 frequencies for British Airways and Iberia.  KLM and British Airways also offer code-share flights with  South Africa ’s Comair Ltd., and Air France connects Paris with
Luanda through a codeshare with TAAG Angola Airlines.  London-based British Airways will start flying to Marrakech
from March 27, offering a year-round service that will fly three
times a week from London Gatwick airport. The Egyptian resort of
Sharm El Sheik is among recent additions from Gatwick, spokesman
Euan Fordyce said.  “Africa is a growing and important market to us and we
have expanded where we feel appropriate and where we have been
permitted in the past few years,” spokesman  Richard Goodfellow 
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
