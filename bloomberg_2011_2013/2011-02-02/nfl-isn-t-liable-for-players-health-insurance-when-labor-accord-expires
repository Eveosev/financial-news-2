National Football League teams won’t
have to pay health insurance costs for players after their
collective bargaining agreement expires in March.  A Philadelphia arbitrator denied a grievance filed by the
NFL Players Association, ruling that the U.S.’s most-watched
television sport isn’t required to continue to pay for such
benefits after the labor contract ends, NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  said in an e-mail.  Players can continue their employer-provided health
insurance at their own, or the union’s expense, the NFL has
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
