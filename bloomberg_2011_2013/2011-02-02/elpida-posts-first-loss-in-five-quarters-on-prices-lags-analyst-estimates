  Elpida Memory Inc ., Japan’s sole
maker of computer-memory chips, posted its first loss in five
quarters after prices of the semiconductors plunged.  The net loss was 29.6 billion yen ($363 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of 21.1
billion yen a year earlier, the Tokyo-based manufacturer said in
a statement today. That compares with a forecast for a loss of
13.7 billion yen, according to the average of seven analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Elpida said this week it’s in talks with Hsinchu-based
Powerchip Technology Corp. to shift production of computer-
memory chips to its Taiwanese partner and focus on more
profitable semiconductors for smartphones and tablet computers.
The price of the benchmark DDR3 1-gigabit DRAM chips that help
PCs juggle multiple programs fell about 47 percent in the
December quarter, according to Taipei-based Dramexchange
Technology Inc.  Elpida rose 0.3 percent to 1,212 yen at the 3 p.m. close in
Tokyo trading before the announcement. The benchmark  Nikkei 225 
Stock Average advanced 1.8 percent.  The company, the world’s third-largest maker of dynamic
random access memory, joins bigger competitors Samsung
Electronics Co. and  Hynix Semiconductor Inc . in posting earnings
from the semiconductor business that missed estimates as weak
demand for personal computers damped DRAM prices.  Memory chip prices may start rising again in the first
quarter as computer manufacturers restock component inventories
that ran down last year, Keita Wakabayashi, a technology analyst
at Mito Securities Co. in Tokyo, said on Jan. 18.
