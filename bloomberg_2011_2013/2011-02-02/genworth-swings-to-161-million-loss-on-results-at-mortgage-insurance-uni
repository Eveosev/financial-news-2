  Genworth Financial Inc ., the mortgage
guarantor and life insurer, swung to a fourth-quarter loss on
$350 million in costs tied to backing home loans as fewer
borrowers return to compliance. The stock fell the most in three
months in New York trading.  The net loss of $161 million, or 33 cents a share, compares
with net income of $40 million, or 8 cents, a year earlier, the
Richmond, Virginia-based insurer said today in a statement. The
operating loss, which excludes some investment results, was 28
cents a share, missing the average estimate of a 16-cent profit
from 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The number of borrowers industrywide who caught up on
overdue payments, known as “cures,” fell to  a 2010 low  in
December as U.S. unemployment remained above 9 percent,
according to the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America.
Genworth expects “declines in cure rates going forward,” the
firm said today.  “Housing fundamentals remain challenged and we anticipate
housing prices will continue to decline,” said Kevin Schneider,
head of Genworth’s mortgage insurance unit, in a conference call
today. Mortgage insurers pay lenders when homeowners default and
foreclosures fail to recover costs.  Genworth dropped $1.18, or 8.5 percent, to $12.76 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company
slipped about 7 percent in the 12 months through yesterday on
the New York Stock Exchange, compared with a 22 percent gain for
the 24-company KBW Insurance Index.  ‘Not Acceptable’  Operating losses at the U.S. mortgage-insurance unit
widened to $352 million in the fourth quarter from $74 million a
year earlier. For the full year, Genworth swung to a profit of
$142 million, compared with a loss of $460 million in 2009.  “Our overall results for the quarter and the year were not
acceptable,” Chief Executive Officer Michael D. Fraizer said in
the statement. “We are taking aggressive actions on several
fronts to improve performance in 2011 and beyond, including
strengthening U.S. mortgage insurance reserves while maintaining
good capital flexibility to support new business growth.”  Fraizer is limiting the risk of losses from stock-market
declines by eliminating new sales of new retail and group
variable annuities. Genworth will take a pretax charge of about
$12 million in the first quarter on the scaling back of the
business, the insurer said in a Jan. 6 statement.  Fourth-quarter operating profit at the retirement and
protection business climbed to $138 million from $129 million.
International earnings advanced to $117 million from $101
million.  MGIC, PMI  Net investment losses narrowed to $26 million from $54
million in the same period last year. Assets under management
gained to $52.2 billion from $46.3 billion a year earlier.  Competitors in the U.S. mortgage insurance business also
declined today. Milwaukee-based MGIC Investment Corp. fell 4.9
percent to $8.53. Radian Group Inc. slumped 2 percent and PMI
Group Inc. lost 4.2 percent.  Genworth repaid $480 million of debt under two five-year
revolving credit lines in November after selling $400 million of
10-year senior notes yielding 7.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
