  Nomura Holdings Inc ., Japan’s largest
brokerage, posted third-quarter profit that missed analysts’
estimates as losses abroad and rising personnel costs
overshadowed gains in trading income.  Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 rose 31
percent to 13.4 billion yen ($164 million) from 10.2 billion yen
a year earlier, the company said in a statement in Tokyo today.
That was smaller than the 20 billion yen median estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Nomura has yet to reap the benefits of its expansion after
tripling overseas staff following its acquisition of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. assets in 2008. The firm’s global ranking
for equity underwriting and advice on mergers slipped last
quarter, even as Chief Executive Officer Kenichi Watanabe, 58,
looks abroad to make up for waning growth prospects at home.  “Looking ahead, the market is closely watching how much
and how fast Nomura will be able to expand profit from their
overseas businesses, in particular the U.S., where the company
has brought the most focus on,” said Azuma Ohno, a Tokyo-based
analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG.  The brokerage posted a 3 billion yen pretax loss on
overseas business in the third quarter, led by  Europe  and Asia,
compared with a profit of 7.5 billion yen a year earlier.  Investment banking fees declined 24 percent from a year
earlier to 34 billion yen and brokerage commissions slipped to
100 billion yen from 101.1 billion yen, the statement said.  Trading Profit  Trading profit rose 58 percent to 104.9 billion yen, helped
by the  Nikkei 225  Stock Average’s 9.2 percent jump in the period.    Daiwa Securities Group Inc ., Japan’s second-largest
brokerage, yesterday said third-quarter profit plunged to 1.2
billion yen from 26.4 billion yen a year earlier as a decline in
underwriting fees outweighed gains from trading.  For the nine months ended Dec. 31, Nomura’s net income slid
66 percent to 16.8 billion yen. By comparison, Nikko Cordial
Securities Inc., the brokerage acquired by  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc . from Citigroup Inc. in 2009, earned 22
billion yen in the same period.  Nomura’s staffing costs increased 13 percent last quarter
from a year earlier to 143.1 billion yen, the highest in five
quarters, the bank said. The firm has boosted its workforce
outside of Japan to 12,028 employees as of last September from
4,089 in March 2008. In the U.S., it is investing 250 billion
yen and plans to offer research coverage on 600 companies.  U.S. Is Key  In Europe, the firm posted a 3.4 billion yen loss before
taxes and in Asia it lost 2.4 billion yen, today’s figures
showed. In the U.S., the bank recorded profit of 2.7 billion yen,
down from 6.3 billion yen a year earlier.  “U.S. business improvement is the key to tell if Nomura
will able to raise its bottom line,” said  Takehito Yamanaka , a
Tokyo-based analyst at MF Global FXA Securities Ltd. “It will
be easier for Nomura to do business in the U.S. than  Asia , where
it may face different cultures and regulations.”  The firm’s shares rose 4 percent to 516 yen today before
the earnings announcement. They have lost 27 percent over the
past year compared with a 0.8 percent gain in the Nikkei.  Nomura fell to 10th in global equity underwriting rankings
for the fiscal third quarter, arranging 18 transactions worth
$9.2 billion. It was No. 3 a year earlier, when it underwrote 30
deals worth $14.7 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The U.S. is the world’s biggest market, and at the same
time it’s the most competitive market,” Chief Financial Officer
Masafumi Nakada said in a press briefing.  In mergers and acquisitions advisory, Nomura was No. 19
globally last quarter, advising on 40 transactions worth $15
billion. The firm was ranked 15th a year earlier with 40 deals
worth $25.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
