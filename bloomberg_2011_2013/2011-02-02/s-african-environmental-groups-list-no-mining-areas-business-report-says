South African environmental groups
proposed a list of restricted areas for miners and prospectors,
Business Report said, citing Mark Botha, head of conservation at
World Wildlife Fund  South Africa .  The list, compiled with data from the country’s
biodiversity institute, will probably feed into work being done
by a government group set up last year to look at mining in
“sensitive areas,” the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
