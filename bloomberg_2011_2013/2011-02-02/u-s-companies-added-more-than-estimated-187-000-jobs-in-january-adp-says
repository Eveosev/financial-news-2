Companies in the U.S. added more
workers than forecast to payrolls in January, showing a pickup
in the labor market, data from a private report showed today.  Employment increased by 187,000 last month after a revised
247,000 gain in December that was less than initially estimated,
according to figures from ADP Employer Services. The median
estimate in the Bloomberg News survey called for a 140,000 gain
last month.  Bigger payroll gains are needed to help bring down an  unemployment rate  that Federal Reserve policy makers say is too
high. A Labor Department report in two days is forecast to show
companies added 140,000 jobs in January, while the jobless rate
rose to 9.5 percent.  “I see a clear pattern of strengthening, acceleration here
that is very encouraging,”  Joel Prakken , chairman of
Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, which produces the figures with ADP,
said on a conference call. “The economy is starting to
accelerate.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 33 economists ranged
from a decline of 100,000 to an increase of 200,000.  Stocks declined after the report, with the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index falling 0.2 percent to 1,304.59 at 9:48 a.m. in  New York . Treasuries rose, pushing down the yield on the
benchmark 10-year note to 3.42 percent from 3.44 percent late
yesterday.  Job-Cut Announcements  Job cuts announced by U.S. employers dropped in January by
46 percent to 38,519, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
The Chicago-based placement firm said it marked the fewest job
cuts for any January since record-keeping began in 1993.  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figures were
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in July, when it understated the gain in jobs by
29,000. The estimate was least accurate in December, when it
overestimated the employment gain by 184,000.  After ADP initially reported a 297,000 jump in company
payrolls for December, the biggest gain since records began in
2001, some economists raised their private jobs forecast before
the Labor Department’s figures. When those figures were released
two days later, they were weaker than forecast.  Today’s ADP report showed an increase of 21,000 workers in
goods-producing industries, which includes manufacturers and
construction companies. Service providers added 166,000 workers.  Factory Employment  Employment at factories increased 19,000 jobs, ADP said.  Companies employing more than 499 workers expanded their
workforces by 11,000 jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to
499 employees, created 79,000 jobs and small companies increased
payrolls by 97,000, ADP said.  Ford Motor Corp. and  Norfolk Southern Corp . are among
companies planning to increase payrolls this year. The Dearborn,
Michigan-based automaker plans to hire more than 7,000 workers
in the next two years, including engineers with expertise in
battery-powered cars,  Mark Truby , a company spokesman, said in
an interview in  Detroit  on Jan. 10.  The economy accelerated at the end of 2010 as  consumer
spending  climbed by the most in more than four years. Gross
domestic product grew at a 3.2 percent annual rate, Commerce
Department figures showed Jan. 28.  “Our service levels have improved and we’re continuing our
targeted hiring and bringing on new locomotives in anticipation
of future growth,” Charles Moorman, chief executive officer at
Norfolk Southern, said on a Jan. 25 teleconference. “Looking
ahead to 2011, we expect to handle increased business.”  January Employment  Overall payrolls probably rose by 142,000 in January,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed before
the Labor Department’s Feb. 4 report. The forecasts for the
private and total payrolls are almost the same because
government employment may have been little changed last month.  Fed  policy makers said after their latest meeting Jan. 26
that improvements in the economy didn’t meet the threshold for
scaling back their plans to purchase $600 billion in bonds to
help bring down an unemployment rate that’s above 9 percent.  “The economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate
that has been insufficient to bring about a significant
improvement in labor market conditions,” the Fed said.  The ADP report is based on data from about 340,000
businesses employing more than 21 million workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
