  Electronic Arts Inc ., the second-
largest U.S. video-game maker, rose the most in more than two
years in Nasdaq trading after reporting third-quarter profit
that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Electronic Arts, based in  Redwood City ,  California , jumped
$2.47 to $18.09 at 4 p.m. New York time, the biggest gain since
Oct. 28, 2008.  Third-quarter profit increased to 59 cents a share,
excluding some items, Electronic Arts said yesterday in a
statement, citing sales of titles including “Medal of Honor”
and “Need for Speed.” Analysts predicted 56 cents, the average
of estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Sales, excluding changes in
deferred revenue, came to $1.41 billion, compared with the $1.43
billion average estimate.  The long-awaited “Star Wars” online subscription-based
game, due after April, will cost less than most estimates, some
as high as $300 million, and can be profitable with just 500,000
ongoing users, Chief Executive Officer John Riccitiello said in
a conference call with analysts after the earnings report.  The company also announced a $600 million share repurchase
program, its first since fiscal 2004.  Anthony Gikas, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. in  Minneapolis , raised his rating on the stock today to
“overweight” from “neutral” and lifted his 12-month
projection on the stock to $19.50.  Christopher Hickey, a London-based analyst at Atlantic
Equities, raised his rating to “neutral” from “underweight”
with a price target of $18 in the next 12 months.  Electronic Arts reported a 39 percent increase in sales of
games sold digitally in the period ended Dec. 31. About 20
percent of revenue now comes from games for products such as  Apple Inc .’s iPhone and iPad,  Amazon.com Inc .’s Kindle and
personal computers, the company said.  Forecast  The current quarter is running according to plan, Eric Brown, chief financial officer, said in an interview yesterday.
The company released “Dead Space 2” to a Metacritic.com score
of 91, and the sequel space-shooter game is outselling the
original 2-for-1, he said.  The company forecasts fourth-quarter sales of $850 million
to $950 million, excluding changes in deferred revenue. That
compares with analysts’ projections of $939.4 million. Profit is
projected at 15 cents to 25 cents a share, excluding some items,
compared with analysts’ estimates of 21 cents.  Including changes in deferred revenue and other items,
Electronics Arts reported its third-quarter net loss widened to
$322 million, or 97 cents a share, from $82 million, or 25
cents, a year earlier. Sales on that basis fell 15 percent to
$1.05 billion, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
