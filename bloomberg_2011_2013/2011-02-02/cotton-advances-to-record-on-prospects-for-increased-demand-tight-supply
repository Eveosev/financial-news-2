Cotton futures surged to a record on
mounting supply concerns after flooding in  Pakistan  and
Australia slashed crops.  Pakistan, the world’s fourth-biggest grower, faces a
shortfall of 2.5 million bales, according to the nation’s
textile mills association. An Australia industry group said last
month that 300,000 bales were lost, and the northeast part of
the country has been pounded by Tropical Cyclone Yasi. Cotton
inventories monitored by ICE Futures U.S. tumbled 85 percent
since June 1 and prices have more than doubled.  “The fundamentals of the current crop remain bullish,”
said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in Mandeville,
Louisiana. “Cotton is leading the commodities bull-market
pack.”  Cotton futures for March delivery rose by exchange the
maximum of 4 cents, or 2.3 percent, to a record $1.7622 a pound
at 2:49 p.m. on ICE in  New York . The price jumped 16 percent
last month, the biggest gain among the 19 commodities in the
Thomson/Reuters Jefferies CRB Index.  Prices have surged as demand boomed in  China , the world’s
biggest consumer. In 2010, the country’s cotton imports jumped
86 percent to 2.84 million metric tons, according to customs
data. That’s the most since 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  China “continues to aggressively buy at high levels in
order to ensure delivery of cotton to meet robust demand,”
