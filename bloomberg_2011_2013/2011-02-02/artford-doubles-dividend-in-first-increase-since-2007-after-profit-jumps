  Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc ., the insurer that repaid a U.S. bailout last year, raised
its dividend for the first time since 2007 after fourth-quarter
profit climbed on narrower investment losses. Shares gained in
late trading in New York.  Net income advanced to $619 million, or $1.24 a share, from
$557 million, or $1.19, a year earlier, the Hartford,
Connecticut-based company said today in a statement. Excluding
some investments, earnings were $1.06 a share, beating the 99-
cent average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
quarterly dividend was doubled to 10 cents a share.  Chief Executive Officer  Liam McGee  is scaling back
businesses and rebuilding capital lost in the financial crisis
of 2008 and 2009. McGee, 56, has pared commercial-mortgage
holdings and limited sales of equity-linked retirement products.  “Our entire portfolio is doing better,” McGee said in an
interview. The dividend increase was an initial move to manage
capital, and “I think we’re in the early stages of considering
anything additional,” McGee said.  Hartford rose $1.07, or 3.8 percent, to $29 at 5:41 p.m. in
New York after the close of regular trading. The company climbed
about 10 percent in past 12 months on the New York Stock
Exchange, compared with a 20 percent gain for the  KBW Insurance
Index .  Mortgage Losses  Impairments and changes to reserves held against mortgage
losses were $57 million in the last three months of the year.
Declines in real-estate assets prompted Hartford to book $434
million of impairments in the fourth quarter of 2009, according
to the company’s earnings statement of a year ago.  McGee, hired in 2009 after a career at Bank of America
Corp., sold stock and debt in March to repay Hartford’s $3.4
billion U.S. bailout. The insurer, which lost more than $4
billion in the five quarters prior to McGee’s arrival, reported
net income of $666 million in the three months ended Sept. 30.  Hartford agreed in December to sell a claims-administration
business for $278 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
