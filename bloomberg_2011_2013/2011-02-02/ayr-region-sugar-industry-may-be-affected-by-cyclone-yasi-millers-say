Destructive winds from Tropical
Cyclone Yasi could affect the sugar industry south of
Townsville, where four mills are located, in addition to
production areas further north, Australian Sugar Milling Council
Chief Executive Officer Dominic Nolan said by phone.  “Just south of Townsville could also be affected depending
on how far south the gale force winds go,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
