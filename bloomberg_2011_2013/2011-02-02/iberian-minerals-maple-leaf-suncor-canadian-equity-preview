Canadian stocks fell for the first
time in four days after gold futures dropped as the metal lost
appeal as an alternative investment following a U.S. employment
report that was stronger than forecast.    Barrick Gold Corp ., the world’s largest producer, declined
1.9 percent as gold stocks retreated after surging 4.1 percent
since protests erupted in Egypt last week.  Magna International
Inc ., Canada’s biggest auto-parts maker, lost 5.8 percent as
U.S. carmakers closed 24 assembly plants because of a snowstorm.  Teck Resources Ltd ., the country’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, rose 2.1 percent as the employment report added to
signals of economic growth.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 32.33
points, or 0.2 percent, from a 29-month high to 13,680.29.  “Last week, when gold outperformed, it was the fear trade
coming back,” said Keith McLean, who oversees C$150 million
($152 million) as a money manager at GMP Investment Management
in Toronto. “We were going into a period where fundamentals
mattered less and fear mattered more. As we’ve come back from
that fear and people understand the macro environment is very
good, it sets up a very bullish picture for some of the consumed
commodities” like copper and oil.  The index had increased 3.4 percent from Jan. 25 to
yesterday, led by energy and raw-materials stocks, as oil and
gold advanced on the strife in  Egypt  while base metals rose on
signs of manufacturing expansion in the U.S.,  China  and Europe.  ‘Conciliatory Voices’  “People are looking at the Egyptian situation, and the
people in charge of those questionable countries are acting the
way they should be,” McLean said. “They’re using conciliatory
voices. I’m pretty confident that we can move on.”  Gold futures fell 0.6 percent to $1,332.10 an ounce in  New
York . U.S. employment increased by 187,000 jobs last month after
a revised 247,000 gain in December that was less than initially
estimated, according to figures from ADP Employer Services. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 140,000 gain.  Barrick dropped 1.9 percent to C$46.94.  Goldcorp Inc ., the
world’s second-largest producer of the metal by market value,
declined 1.2 percent to C$40.32.  Eldorado Gold Corp ., Canada’s
fifth-biggest gold-mining company by market value, lost 1.7
percent to C$16.04.  Copper fell from a record high, dropping 0.3 cent to
$4.544. Teck rose 2.1 percent to C$63.70.  First Quantum    First Quantum Minerals Ltd ., Canada’s second-largest
publicly traded copper producer, gained 1.2 percent to C$123.71
after David Radclyffe, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, said it
would be an attractive acquisition candidate for Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.  Magna lost 5.8 percent, the most since June 2009, to
C$55.11 as the weather shut factories in the U.S. Midwest. Also
today, Morgan Stanley cut its 2011 profit forecast for  Ford
Motor Co ., a Magna customer, to $2.40 a share from $3 a share.  Most S&P/TSX energy companies retreated after the group
rallied to a 28-month high yesterday on concern that the Middle
East conflict may interfere with crude supplies.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Canada’s second-largest
energy company by market value, lost 1.5 percent to C$44.30.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp ., which produces oil and gas in
Colombia, slumped 2.4 percent to C$33.60. Penn West Petroleum
Ltd, a western Canadian oil producer, slipped 1.4 percent to
C$26.84.    Opti Canada Inc ., Nexen Inc.’s partner in oil-sands
development, plunged a record 40 percent to 27 cents after
sinking 35 percent yesterday. Moody’s Investors Service reduced
its corporate family credit rating on the company to Caa3 from
Caa2, citing Opti’s “declining liquidity and our view that the
company will be unable to meet all of its cash requirements in
2011.”    Ballard Power Systems Inc ., a maker of hydrogen fuel cells,
soared 27 percent, the most in 16 months, to C$2.12. The company
reported a third-quarter loss of 1 cent a share, 89 percent
narrower than the average of four analyst estimates, excluding
certain items.  To contact the reporter on this story:
