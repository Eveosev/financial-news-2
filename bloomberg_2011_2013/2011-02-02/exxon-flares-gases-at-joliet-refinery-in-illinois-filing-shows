  Exxon Mobil Corp . reported that a
blower associated with a unit tripped offline at its Joliet oil
refinery in Illinois.  The cause of the incident is being investigated and
production wasnâ€™t affected, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman,
said in an e-mail.  Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide were among the gases
released at about 10 p.m. local time yesterday through the flare
system, according to a filing with the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency.  The refinery has the capacity to process 248,000 barrels of
crude oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
