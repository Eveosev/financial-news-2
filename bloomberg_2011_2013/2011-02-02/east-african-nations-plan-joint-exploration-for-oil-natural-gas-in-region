East African countries will jointly
explore their “vast” oil and gas fields to foster development
of their economies,  Uganda  Prime Minister Apollo Nsibambi said.  The cooperation will attract more investment capital and
spur economic growth, Nsibambi told a petroleum conference today
in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, with giving details on how this
will work.  Discoveries of 2.5 million barrels of oil reserves in
Uganda and 3 trillion cubic feet of  natural gas  in Tanzania had
been made, he said.  East African countries formed a “strategy on regional
refineries development” in 2008, two years after Uganda
discovered the oil reserves. Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda and
Burundi make up the East African Community bloc.  Uganda will issue more oil-exploration licenses later this
year after a new industry law is formulated, Nsibambi said. It
has five remaining oil blocks after suspending the awarding of
concessions in 2006 pending the new law, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
