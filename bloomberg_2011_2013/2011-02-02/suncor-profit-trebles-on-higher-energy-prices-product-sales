  Suncor Energy Inc .,  Canada â€™s largest
oil company, said fourth-quarter earnings almost tripled on
higher energy prices and increased product sales.  Net income increased to C$1.35 billion ($1.37 billion), or
87 cents a share, from C$457 million, or 29 cents, a year
earlier, Calgary-based Suncor said today in a statement. Per-
share operating earnings exceeded the average estimate of 18
analysts in a Bloomberg survey by 9 cents.  Production in the quarter fell to the equivalent of 625,600
barrels of crude a day from 638,200 barrels in the year-earlier
period, following asset sales. Oil sands, excluding syncrude,
posted a record output of 325,900 barrels a day because of
improved operations and increased bitumen supply, Suncor said.  The quarterly dividend was set at 10 cents a share.  Last month, Suncor sold stakes in oil-sands developments in  Alberta  to Total SA for C$1.75 billion.  Suncor rose 15 cents to C$41.61 on the Toronto Stock
Exchange yesterday. The shares have risen 27 percent in the past
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
