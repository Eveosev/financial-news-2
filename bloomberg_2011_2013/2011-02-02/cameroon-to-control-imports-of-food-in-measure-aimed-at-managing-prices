Cameroon’s  government established an
agency to control imports of basic goods, especially food items,
in a bid to manage prices, President Paul Biya said.  The Mission for the Regulation of Supplies and Basic
Necessities “is charged with buying and stocking goods” at
approved prices, Biya said in a statement handed to reporters in
Yaounde, the capital, today. The agency will set up warehouses
across the country, he said.  “The president’s decision does not forbid other enterprises
from importing,” said Trade Minister Luc Magloire Mbarga
Atangana in an interview today. Cameroon was among the African
nations hit by high global food prices in 2008. During that
time, it cut  customs duties  on fish, wheat, salt and sugar,
Atangana said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
