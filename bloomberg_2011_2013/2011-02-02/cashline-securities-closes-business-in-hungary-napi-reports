Cashline Securities Zrt. , a Hungarian
brokerage, will close down after 18 years,  Napi Gazdasag
reported , citing owner Otto Albrecht.  Albrecht said lower turnover on the Budapest Stock
Exchange, special taxes on the financial industry and the
effective nationalization of private pension fund portfolios
prompted the decision to exit the market, the newspaper
reported.  Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt.  will take over Cashlineâ€™s clients
in the next three months, Napi Gazdasag said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
