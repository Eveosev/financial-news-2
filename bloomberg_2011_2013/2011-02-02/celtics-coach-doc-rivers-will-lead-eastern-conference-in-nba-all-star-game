Bostonâ€™s Doc Rivers will coach the
Eastern Conference at the National Basketball Association All-
Star Game.  Rivers got the role after the Celtics (37-11) last night
beat the Sacramento Kings 95-90 to ensure they will have the
best record in the conference through Feb. 6.  Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs will coach the
Western Conference team at the Feb. 20 All-Star Game at Staples
Center in  Los Angeles .  Rivers, 49, directed the Celtics to their 17th NBA
championship in 2008 after a league-best 66-16 regular season
record. That year, he coached the East team to a 134-128 victory
in  New Orleans .  To contact the reporter on this story:
