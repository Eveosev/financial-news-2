Spot oil products strengthened in the  Gulf Coast  as Alon USA Energy LLC and Valero Energy Corp.
reported reduced rates or complications at refineries because of
weather.  Alon trimmed rates to 50,000 barrels a day at its Big
Spring refinery in Texas because of extreme weather conditions.
Valero reported emissions at its Corpus Christi West plant
associated with an amine unit “due to cold weather,” according
to a filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.6 cent to 7.75 cents versus futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:48 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped 0.33 cent to
$2.4256.  A hard freeze warning was posted for much of eastern Texas
and southwestern  Louisiana . The Electricity Reliability Council
of  Texas , which operates most of the state’s grid, ordered
rotating blackouts for the third time in 22 years to help power
companies cope with the cold.  The Big Spring plant, with a capacity of 70,000 barrels a
day, shut sulfur recovery units earlier today, according to a
filing with state regulators.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel in the Gulf strengthened 0.7
cent, narrowing its discount to 2.05 cents versus Nymex heating
oil futures.  The same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3, weakened 0.38
cent to a discount of 2.13 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
