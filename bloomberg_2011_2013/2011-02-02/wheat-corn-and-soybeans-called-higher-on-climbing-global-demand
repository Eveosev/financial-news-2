What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures are called to open 12 cents to 15 cents a
bushel higher on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City
Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation
that governments will increase purchases to rebuild inventories
as adverse weather threatens crops in the U.S. and  Australia ,
said Jim Gerlach, the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler,
Indiana.  -- Corn futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago on rising global demand for animal feed, food and fuel
made from the grain, Gerlach said.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 9 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT on speculation that demand for U.S. supplies may
increase amid reduced production of competing oilseeds, Gerlach
said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open up 0.4 cent to
0.5 cent a pound and soybean-meal futures may open little
changed per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
