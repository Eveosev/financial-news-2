Investors pulled money from U.S.
municipal-bond mutual funds for the 12th consecutive week and
added cash to domestic stock funds for the third straight time,
the longest streak of deposits since April.  Muni-bond funds had net redemptions of $2.7 billion in the
week ended Jan. 26, the  Investment Company Institute  said today
in an e-mailed statement from  Washington . The withdrawals,
triggered by concern that financially strapped cities and states
may default, total $33.5 billion over the 12-week stretch.  U.S. municipal bonds lost 5.3 percent in the three months
ended Jan. 31, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Municipal Master Index. Banking analyst  Meredith Whitney  stirred
debate in the $2.86 trillion muni-debt market by predicting in
December as many as 100 significant defaults this year reaching
“hundreds of billions” of dollars.  Investors added $3.2 billion to domestic stock funds in the
most recent week. In April, the funds attracted money for four
weeks in a row, ICI data show. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
of U.S. equities has climbed about 3.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
