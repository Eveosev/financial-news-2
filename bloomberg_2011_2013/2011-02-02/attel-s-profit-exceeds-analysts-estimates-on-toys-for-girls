  Mattel Inc ., the world’s largest
toymaker, reported fourth-quarter profit that surpassed
analysts’ estimates on increased sales of games, puzzles and
toys for girls.  Net income fell to $325.2 million, or 89 cents a share,
in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $328.4 million, or
89 cents, a year ago, the El Segundo, California-based company
said today in a statement. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
projected earnings per share of 86 cents. The company reported a
tax benefit of 8 cents a year ago.  Mattel’s offerings tied to Pixar’s “Toy Story 3” movie
helped increase sales 8.7 percent to $2.12 billion during the
quarter that included the  holiday shopping season . The film, the
highest grossing in the U.S. last year, was released on DVD in
November, giving a further boost to the toys.  Mattel rose 47 cents, or 2 percent, to $24.15 yesterday in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock advanced 27 percent last
year.    Hasbro Inc ., the world’s second-largest toymaker, reported
last month that sales in 2010 unexpectedly declined in the U.S.
as consumers spent less than anticipated during the holidays.
Some retailers, including  Target Corp ., cited weakness in toy
sales during the holidays.  To contact the reporters on this story:
