Gold may decline in  New York  as signs
of an economic recovery and higher equities curb investment
demand for the metal.  Manufacturing in the U.S. unexpectedly accelerated in
January at the fastest pace in more than six years, data showed
yesterday. European manufacturing also gained. That helped push
copper to a record as global equities climbed to the highest
level in more than two years. Gold has been supported by
spreading Middle East political unrest and as the dollar slipped
to an almost three-month low against the euro.  Manufacturing data “has led to greater optimism over the
global economy, putting further downward pressure on gold,”
Marc Ground, an analyst at Standard Bank Plc, wrote in a report.
“Given the tide of risk appetite, as evident by a strong
showing of equities, we think that gold will continue to
struggle to break through $1,350 an ounce. The only real support
is coming from a weaker dollar and concerns regarding global
inflation.”  Gold futures for April delivery lost $2.90, or 0.2 percent,
to $1,337.40 an ounce at 7:55 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The
metal for immediate delivery in London was 0.1 percent lower at
$1,336.57.  Gold has lost 5.9 percent this year as the  MSCI World  Index
of stocks advanced 4.3 percent. The metal jumped 30 percent last
year after governments spent trillions of dollars and kept  interest rates  low to bolster economies, while  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis also boosted demand. Gold futures reached
a record $1,432.50 on Dec. 7.  ‘Risk Appetite Improved’  The manufacturing data removed “some of gold’s safe-haven
appeal as risk appetite improved,”  Mark Pervan , head of
commodity research at  Australia  and New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd., wrote in a daily report today. Political tensions in the
Middle East “could be supportive” for gold, he said.  Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  said yesterday that his
30-year rule will end with elections due in September after
hundreds of thousands rallied against his regime. In Jordan,  King Abdullah  replaced his prime minister following street
protests, and Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh said today he
won’t seek to extend his term when it expires in 2013.  Bullion held through exchange-traded products fell for a
seventh day, losing 2.47 metric tons to 2,028.74 tons yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show. That’s the
lowest level since June 9. Holdings reached a record 2,114.6
tons in December.  Silver for March delivery in New York lost 0.6 percent to
$28.355 an ounce. Palladium for March delivery fell 0.5 percent
to $819.50 an ounce, and platinum for April delivery was 0.1
percent lower at $1,831.40 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
