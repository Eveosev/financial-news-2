  Ace Ltd ., the insurer added to the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index last year, said fourth-quarter
profit rose 5 percent on improved returns from investments and a
rise in policy sales.  Net income advanced to $1 billion, or $2.92 a share, from
$953 million, or $2.81, a year earlier, the Zurich-based company
said today in a statement. Operating income, which excludes some
investment results, was $2.05 a share, beating the $1.84 average
estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Ace, which has offices in more than 50 countries, remained
profitable during a global economic decline that has crimped
demand for coverage. Chief Executive Officer Evan Greenberg, 56,
expanded beyond commercial property-casualty insurance through
acquisitions, adding life and general insurance companies in  Asia  and purchasing a majority stake in a U.S. crop insurer.  “They’re  building a very good, high-quality portfolio of
non-correlated products, as well as businesses that are
geographically diverse,” said Michael Paisan, an analyst at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co., before the earnings were announced.
“It’s kind of the like the conglomerate theory, where you’re
not at the whims of any single market.” Paisan has a “buy”
rating on the stock.  Ace shares advanced 34 cents to $62.50 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have gained 26
percent in the past year compared with a 18 percent gain in the
S&P 500 Index.  In 2010, ACE agreed to pay about $1.1 billion for a
majority stake in Rain & Hail Insurance Service Inc., $425
million for  New York  Life Insurance Co.’s  Hong Kong  and South
Korean life units and $210 million for Malaysia-based Jerneh
Insurance Bhd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
