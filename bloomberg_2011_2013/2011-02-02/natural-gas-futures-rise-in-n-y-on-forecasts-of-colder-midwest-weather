Natural gas futures climbed for the
third day in four in  New York  on forecasts of below-normal
temperatures in the Midwest that would boost demand for the
heating fuel.  Gas rose 1.9 percent as the National Weather Service
predicted colder-than-normal weather in the northern Midwest and
Great Lakes from Feb. 7 through Feb. 11. Earlier outlooks had
indicated that the coldest weather would be south of that area,
where heating demand is typically lower.  “First we had the snow, and now we have very cold weather
on the way,” said Phil Flynn, vice president of research at
PFGBest in Chicago. “The reality of the snow hitting was a
psychological boost, and now we’re getting a bit of a bounce.”  Natural gas for March delivery gained 8.2 cents to settle
at $4.429 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 19 percent from a
year ago.  The Energy Department tomorrow may report a larger-than-
average stockpile decline, according to the median of 17 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The department may say supplies
dropped 187 billion cubic feet last week, more than the five-
year average drop of 165 billion, according to the estimates.  “You’ve had pretty good uplifting in terms of heating
demand last week,” said  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst in Houston
at Canaccord Genuity. “From a storage picture, things are
getting a little bit more supportive.”  Supply Report  Gas  inventories  as of Jan. 21 totaled 2.542 trillion cubic
feet, 1.2 percent above the five-year average and 0.4 above
year-earlier levels, according to the Energy Department.  The low temperature in  Chicago  on Feb. 14 may be 11 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 12 Celsius), 10 degrees below normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,  Pennsylvania .
The low in  Detroit  may be 10 degrees, 10 below normal.  U.S. heating demand may be 24 percent above normal from
Feb. 8 through Feb. 12, according to Weather Derivatives in
Belton,  Missouri . About 52 percent of U.S. households use
natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.  A winter  storm  brought snow to Chicago and  Boston  and
freezing rain from Philadelphia to New York.  Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport reported 17 inches
of snow, and the city’s Midway Airport reported 16, according to
Rob Carolan, a meteorologist at  Hometown Forecast Services  in
Nashua,  New Hampshire .  Both marks are short of the record 23 inches that fell Jan.
26-27, 1967.  The bulk of storm has moved out of the upper Midwest and
into the Northeast, where heavy snow was expected for the
mountains of New Hampshire and  Maine , according to the  National
Weather Service .  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
249,553 as of 2:64 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 290,000. Volume was 219,239 yesterday. Open interest was
831,568 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
793,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
