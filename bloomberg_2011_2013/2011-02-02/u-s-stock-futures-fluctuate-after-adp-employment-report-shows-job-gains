U.S. stock-index futures fluctuated
between gains and losses after a report showed U.S. companies
added more jobs than expected in January.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,302.3 at 8:22 a.m. in  New
York . Dow futures climbed less than 0.1 percent to 11,976.  Companies in the U.S. added 187,000 workers to their
payrolls in January, figures from ADP Employer Services showed.
The ADP number was forecast to show a gain of 140,000 jobs last
month, according to the median estimate of 33 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Projections ranged from a decline of
100,000 to an increase of 200,000.  U.S. stocks climbed yesterday after American and Chinese
manufacturing expanded and United Parcel Service Inc. beat
analysts’ earnings estimates. The S&P 500 has rallied 2.5
percent in the past two days, erasing the Jan. 28 slump that was
driven by political unrest in  Egypt .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
