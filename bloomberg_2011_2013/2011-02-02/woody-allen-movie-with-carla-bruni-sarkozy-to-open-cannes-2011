Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris,”
a romantic comedy featuring  France ’s First Lady Carla Bruni- Sarkozy, will open this year’s  Cannes Film Festival , organizers
said in an e-mailed release.  Shot entirely in the French capital, the movie stars Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams and Marion Cotillard. Bruni-Sarkozy --
wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- has a secondary
role.  Allen’s movie “is a wonderful love letter to Paris,”
Festival Director Thierry Fremaux said, noting that the director
“takes a deeper look” at themes he has previously explored:
“our relationship with history, art, pleasure, and life.”  This year’s festival, the 64th of its kind, will be held
from May 11 to 22 in the Riviera resort.  To contact the reporter on the story:
