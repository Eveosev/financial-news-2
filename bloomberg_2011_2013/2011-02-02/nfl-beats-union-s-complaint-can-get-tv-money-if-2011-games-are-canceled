The  National Football League  can
receive television revenue even if games are wiped out this
coming season by a labor dispute with players, a special master
ruled.  The National Football League Players Association filed a
complaint in June claiming the NFL unfairly negotiated $4
billion in television contracts. That complaint was rejected
yesterday by Special Master Stephen Burbank, who resolves
disputes between the league and its players.  Union attorney Jeffrey Kessler said in June that NFL owners
knowingly took less money for some broadcast rights to ensure
they would get paid even if there are no games. Taking less
money affects players, who share league revenue.  The NFL applauded Burbank’s ruling and called on players to
focus their efforts on negotiations for a new collective
bargaining agreement. The current deal expires in early March.  “If the union commits to invest as much time, energy and
other resources in negotiations as it has in its litigation
strategy, a new agreement could well be reached by March 4,”
the NFL said in its e-mailed statement. “Now it’s time to get
back to the bargaining table.”  The NFLPA said in an e-mailed statement that the players
intend to file an appeal before U.S. District Judge David Doty
in  Minneapolis , who has overseen the NFL labor contract since
1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
