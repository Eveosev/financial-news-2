Treasury 10-year notes snapped a two-
day drop on concern political turmoil in  Egypt  may worsen,
fueling demand for safe assets.  U.S. securities reversed yesterday’s losses as protesters
rejected President  Hosni Mubarak ’s promise to make way for a new
leader in elections in September. Treasuries earlier pared an
advance after ADP Employer Services reported a higher-than-
forecast increase in jobs last month. The government said it
will sell $72 billion of notes and bonds in its quarterly
refunding next week.  “All eyes are back on what’s going on in Egypt,” said
Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors. “Things seem to be erupting, and Egypt is getting
closer to a worst-case scenario after it seemed to calm down a
bit over the weekend.”  Benchmark 10-year note yields declined two basis points to
3.42 percent at 10:23 a.m. in  New York , according to BGCantor
Market Data. The 2.625 percent security maturing in November
2020 rose 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 93 15/32.
Thirty-year bond yields fell two basis points to 4.60 percent.  The U.S. will auction $32 billion of 3-year notes, $24
billion of 10-year debt and $16 billion of 30-year bonds in
daily offerings that begin Feb. 8. The totals, which matched the
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 12 of the Fed’s 18
primary dealers, are the same as at the last refunding in
November.  Treasuries fell yesterday as an industry report showed U.S.
manufacturing unexpectedly accelerated last month to the fastest
pace in more than six years.  The  Federal Reserve  is  buying  $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion
of notes due between February 2021 and November 2027 today as
part of a program to spur employment growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
