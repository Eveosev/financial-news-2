Tropical Cyclone Yasi left more than
180,000 customers in  Australia ’s Queensland state without power,
with electricity to homes and businesses in some areas likely to
be out for as long as a month,  Ergon Energy  said.  “This number is set to rise as the full extent of the
damage is revealed in coming days,” the Queensland-government
owned utility said in an e-mailed statement today.  Restoring power to hospitals and water and sewage plants is
Ergon’s priority, John Stock, a company spokesman, said by phone
today from  Brisbane . The retailer is assembling a crew of 1,200
workers to help with the effort, Ergon said.  Cyclone Yasi crossed Australia’s northeast coast early
today with winds as high as 290 kilometers (180 miles) an hour,
the  Bureau of Meteorology  said. The Category 5 storm made
landfall in Mission Beach, a popular tourist destination about
165 kilometers south of Cairns.  “Ergon Energy has received hundreds of reports of faults
relating to damaged power poles and a large number of fallen
powerlines across the region,” the company said.  The majority of those hit by the outage are near
Townsville, more than 1,100 kilometers north of the state
capital Brisbane, Ergon said. More than 60 percent of Ergon’s
customers in North Queensland are without power, it said.  Cyclone Larry in 2006 cut electricity to 130,000 Ergon
customers in northern Queensland, and it took as long as four
weeks to restore power in some areas, the spokesman Stock said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Paton  in Sydney   jpaton4@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
