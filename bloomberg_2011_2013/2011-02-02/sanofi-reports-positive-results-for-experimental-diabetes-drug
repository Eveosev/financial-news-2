  Sanofi-Aventis SA ’s experimental
diabetes drug lixisenatide, given to volunteer patients once a
day, was at least as effective as Eli Lilly & Co. and  Amylin
Pharmaceuticals Inc .’s twice-daily medicine Byetta in keeping
blood-sugar levels in check, a study found.  The advanced study of 639 patients with the most common
form of diabetes, known as Type 2, showed those taking the
Sanofi drug also had fewer instances of hypoglycemia, a state of
dangerously low blood sugar, Paris-based Sanofi said in a
statement.  Diabetes occurs when the body doesn’t produce or properly
use insulin, a hormone needed to convert sugar, starches and
other food into the energy needed for daily life. Lixisenatide
belongs to a class of drugs that imitate a hormone called GLP-1
to stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin after meals.
Both lixisenatide and Byetta are injections.  Sanofi trails Novo Nordisk A/S and Lilly in developing a
GLP-1 product. Peter Welford, an analyst at Jefferies
International Ltd., wrote in a note to investors today that he
expects lixisenatide to have "blockbuster" sales. The full study
will be released at a medical conference, the drugmaker said.
Zealand Pharma A/S of Denmark developed lixisenatide from the
spit of the Gila monster.  Separately,  Roche Holding AG  said today that it’s stopping
development of another GLP-1 treatment, taspoglutide, and
returning rights to developer Ipsen SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
