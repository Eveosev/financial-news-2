JPMorgan Chase & Co. is holding an
auction to find buyers for $143 million in loans owed to it by  Australia ’s  Centro Properties Group , according to a person
familiar with the matter.  The New York-based bank is seeking investors for senior
portions of the loans, denominated in both U.S. and Australian
dollars, the person said, asking not to be identified as the
details are private. The auction will be held today at 5:00 p.m.
London time, the person said.  Centro, a Melbourne-based shopping mall owner that had
A$18.4 billion ($18.6 billion) of debt as of June 30, ceded
control to creditors in 2008 as property prices slumped and debt
became harder to refinance.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. sold about A$700
million of debt owed to it by the company in November, a person
familiar with the matter said at the time. The sale included
A$495 million of senior debt priced at 63.5 cents in the dollar,
said the person, who asked not to be named because the
information was private.    Commonwealth Bank of Australia  also said in November that
it sold A$110 million of Centro’s debt for about 56.5 cents in
the dollar.  Noelle Waugh, a Sydney-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment when contacted by telephone today.  The Australian Financial Review reported details of
JPMorgan’s planned sale earlier today, citing loan traders it
didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
