  Panasonic Corp . sold its nickel-
hydride battery plant to Hunan Corun New Energy Co., a Chinese
maker of advanced materials and batteries.  The factory in Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo,
manufactures batteries for the automotive industry, Panasonic
said yesterday in a  statement . The company didn’t say how much
Hunan Corun paid for the plant.  Panasonic sold the unit because of the Chinese government’s
concern that the merger last October between Panasonic and Sanyo
Electric Co. created a monopoly in the Chinese market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
