  Scania AB , the Swedish truckmaker
controlled by Volkswagen AG, reported quarterly profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as European demand recovered.  Fourth-quarter net income more than tripled to 3 billion
kronor ($470 million) from 822 million kronor a year ago, the
Soedertaelje, Sweden-based company said in a statement today.
The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for profit of 2.69 billion kronor. Sales advanced 23 percent to
22.5 billion kronor.  Fourth-quarter orders at Scania, which has the best
operating margin in the business, gained 57 percent to 21,758
trucks and buses, the company said. Scania said in November it’s
considering merging with  MAN SE  in Germany to create Europe’s
largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles.  “No decision has been made, since there are a number of
outstanding issues of a commercial and legal nature,” Chief
Executive Officer Leif Oestling said in the statement regarding
a possible combination. “There is a continued risk of bottle-
necks among subcontractors and bodybuilding companies.”  Scania fell as much as 5 kronor, or 3.5 percent, to 138.50
kronor and traded at 139.70 kronor as of 9:34 a.m. in Stockholm.  Scania is the first of the European truckmakers to publish
fourth-quarter figures. Swedish rival  Volvo AB  will release
earnings Feb. 4, while  Daimler AG  will report results Feb. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
