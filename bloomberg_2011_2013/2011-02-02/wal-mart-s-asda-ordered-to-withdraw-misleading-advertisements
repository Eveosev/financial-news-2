Asda, the U.K. food retailer owned by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc ., was ordered to withdraw television and
newspaper advertisements for a price guarantee promotion which
the  Advertising Standards Authority  labelled “misleading.”  The advertisements, featuring a promise by Asda that a
basket of goods will cost at least 10 percent less than at its
major competitors, cannot be shown again in their current form,
the regulatory body said in ruling today following complaints by  Tesco Plc  and William Morrison Supermarkets Plc.  “We told Asda to ensure their ads did not suggest their
price guarantee applied to all items, including non-grocery
items and items that were specifically excluded, or that their
savings claims referred to shopping generally,” the ASA said.  Asda  said in a statement it was “delighted,” noting that
five out of nine complaints weren’t upheld by the ASA. The price
guarantee is “one of the easiest and best ways for shoppers to
compare the cost of their groceries,” the supermarket said.
Asda started a new series of advertisements on Jan. 31.  Welcoming the ruling,  Tesco  described Asda’s campaign as
“misleading and untruthful.”  “Asda has been found out here, but by running virtually
the same campaign again and stretching the truth even further it
is flaunting the spirit of the ASA ruling,,” Tesco Commercial
Director Richard Brasher said in a statement. “I look forward
to a quick resolution to the latest investigation -- customers
have a right to be treated much better than this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
