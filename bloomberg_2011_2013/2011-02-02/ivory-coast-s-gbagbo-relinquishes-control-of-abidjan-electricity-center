Laurent Gbagbo, the  Ivory Coast 
incumbent president, ceded control of a key electricity
distribution center in the commercial capital, Abidjan, two
weeks after it was seized on his order, a company official said.  “The official who was sent in by Gbagbo’s Mines and Energy
Ministry, as well as all military personnel, left the power
distribution center last night,” said Eugene Zady, deputy
director for communications at Compagnie Ivoirienne
d’Electricite, known as CIE.  CIE said on Jan. 28 it had been forced to cut power in the
 north  of the country, where Gbagbo’s rival Alassane Ouattara won
a large majority of votes in a disputed November election.  The disruption also affected neighboring countries. Ivory
Coast is a regional exporter of electricity, supplying Benin,
Togo,  Mali ,  Burkina Faso  and  Ghana .  The electricity monopoly is controled by Washginton-based
investment fund Emerging Capital Partners, through its
Finagestion unit that also has holdings in Senegal.  Ouattara is the internationally recognized winner of the
Nov. 28 election. Gbagbo refuses to cede power to him, alleging
voting fraud in some parts of the north.  To contact the reporter on this story:
