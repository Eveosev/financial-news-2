  Sanofi-Aventis SA  failed to block two
generic drug manufacturers from selling a copy of the cancer
drug Taxotere in Australia, with a federal court judge refusing
to bar the sale of the generics.  Judge Jayne Jagot yesterday denied Sanofi’s request for an
injunction, clearing the way for  Hospira Inc . and Interpharma
Ltd. to sell their copies as soon as a patent on Taxotere’s main
ingredient docetaxel expires Feb. 6.  Taxotere accounts for 95 percent of Sanofi cancer drug
sales in Australia, according to the judge, who wrote “the lost
sales represent substantial sums of money.” Sanofi, based in
Paris, can be compensated for the lost sales if it’s able to
convince a judge at trial that its patent has been infringed,
Jagot ruled.  Taxotere, used to treat prostate cancer, generated 2.18
billion euros ($3.02 billion) in global sales in 2009 for Sanofi.  Alan Brindell, a spokesman for Sanofi in  Australia , didn’t
immediately respond to a request for comment left on his office
voice mail.  Sanofi waited too long to object to the entry of the
generics into the market to be granted a temporary bar on the
sale of the copies, Jagot said.  “There has been undue and inadequately explained delay by
the Aventis parties,” Jagot wrote in the ruling, released on
the court’s website today.  The case is Between Hospira Australia Ltd. and Aventis
Pharma SA. NSD 1521/2010. Federal Court of Australia (Sydney).  To contact the reporter on this story:
