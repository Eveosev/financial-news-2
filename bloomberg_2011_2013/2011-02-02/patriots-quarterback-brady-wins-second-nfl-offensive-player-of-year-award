New England Patriots quarterback  Tom Brady  was named the National Football League’s Offensive Player
of the Year for the second time in four seasons in balloting
compiled by the  Associated Press .  Brady, 33, received 21 of the 50 votes cast by media
members to beat Philadelphia quarterback Michael Vick, who had
11 votes.  “It comes down to the mental toughness and determination
of the players and coaches,” said Brady. “My only
disappointment is that we couldn’t take advantage of our
opportunity in the playoffs, but hopefully we learn from that
and use it as motivation toward accomplishing our goals for next
season.”  Brady, an 11-year NFL veteran, led the Patriots to a
league-best 14-2 mark this season, throwing 355 passes without
being intercepted.  New England  lost 28-21 to the New York Jets
in the playoffs.  The Patriots were undefeated in 2007 when Brady won the
honor the first time. He’s the only quarterback and the only
active player to win the award twice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
