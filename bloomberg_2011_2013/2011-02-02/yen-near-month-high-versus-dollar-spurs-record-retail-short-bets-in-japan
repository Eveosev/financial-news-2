Japanese individual investors’ sales
of the yen against the dollar reached a record on the Tokyo
Financial Exchange’s margin-trading market yesterday, reflecting
bets the Asian currency’s climb to a month high would reverse.
　　Individual investors held a net 280,858 contracts of the
U.S. currency against the yen on Feb. 1, the most since the
exchange’s Click 365 margin-trading market started collecting
the data in July 2006.
　　Individual investors “tend to trade against the market
trend -- buy on dips and sell on rallies,” said  Daisaku Ueno ,
Tokyo-based president of Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd.,a
unit of Japan’s largest online currency broker. “Should the
dollar rise against the yen, those who bought the dollar now are
going to sell.”
　　The yen reached 81.31 per dollar yesterday, the strongest
since Jan. 3. Net longs for 12 currencies against the yen,
including the greenback, euro and Australian dollar, stood at
529,366 contracts on Feb. 1, the Click data showed, down from a
record 606,698 contracts on Jan. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
