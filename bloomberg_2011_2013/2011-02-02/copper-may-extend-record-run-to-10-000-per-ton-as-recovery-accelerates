Copper surged to records in  London 
and  New York  as manufacturing improved from  China  to the U.S.,
bolstering the demand outlook for the metal used in construction
and electrical applications.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange advanced for a sixth day, gaining as much as 0.4
percent to $9,984.75 a metric ton, surpassing the previous peak
of $9,968 reached yesterday. It traded at $9,955 a ton at 2:52
p.m. in  Singapore . March-delivery futures on the Comex in New
York also climbed to an all-time high of $4.5595 a pound.  “The market likes to test big, round numbers, and we’re
looking increasingly at $10,000 pretty soon,” said Yingxi Yu, a
Singapore-based analyst at Barclays Capital. “Strong
macroeconomic data have provided the lift to  market sentiment 
needed for the current rally.”  Manufacturing in the U.S. unexpectedly accelerated in
January at the fastest pace in more than six years; European
manufacturing grew at the quickest pace in nine months; and U.K.
production increased at a record pace in January, data yesterday
showed.  In China, a reading of 52.9 for a purchasing managers’
index released by the logistics federation yesterday exceeded
the 50 level dividing expansion and contraction, while Indian
manufacturing growth accelerated in January, separate reports
showed.  “With the Chinese out, liquidity is thin and volatility
will increase,” said Yu. China’s financial markets are closed
from today through Feb. 8 for the Lunar New Year holiday.  Declining Stockpiles  Copper, often taken as a gauge of economic gauge, surged 30
percent last year as the global economy recovered and investment
demand increased, driving stockpiles lower for the first time
since 2004. Commodity assets under management rose to a record
$376 billion last year, boosted by demand from large investors,  Barclays Capital  said on Jan. 27.  Aluminum in London rose 0.2 percent to $2,557 a ton, lead
gained 0.3 percent to $2,547 a ton, while zinc was little
changed at $2,475 a ton. Nickel increased as much as 0.5 percent
to $28,130 a ton, and tin climbed 0.2 percent to $30,200 a ton
after reaching a record $30,400 a ton yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
