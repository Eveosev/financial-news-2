  Tullow Oil Plc  is one of three
companies planning to conduct at least five seismic surveys in
Kenya this year to establish rock structures, said Peter Thuo, a
team leader at the National Oil Corp. of  Kenya .    Anadarko Petroleum Corp ., which is based in The Woodlands,
Texas, and the state-run National Oil Corp. of Kenya are the
other companies to carry out surveys, Thuo said today in an
interview in Kampala, the capital of neighboring Uganda.  “We expect to make some progress with five or more seismic
surveys this year,” he said. “The companies want to identify
drilling locations.”  East Africa’s biggest economy has 36 onshore and offshore
oil blocks, 22 of which were awarded to 10 companies for
exploration, Thuo said. Tullow and Anadarko have five blocks
each, while the country’s national oil company has one, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
