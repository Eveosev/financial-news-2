Francisco Giants as a front office consultant, the San Francisco
Chronicle  reported .  Piniella, who retired as manager of the  Chicago Cubs  in
August to spend more time with his ailing mother, will be based

1984 and managed the team from 1986 to 1988.  Piniella, 67, spent 23 seasons as a major league manager
and ranks 14th on the all-time wins list, with a 1,835-1,713

became the first manager in 100 years to lead the franchise to
consecutive playoff appearances. He also won a  World Series  as
