Sugar futures surged to a 30-year
high on mounting concern that global supplies will trail demand
following crop damage in  Australia  and India, two of the world’s
leading producers.  Cyclone Yasi, which pounded the coast of Australia’s
Queensland state, may cause the sugar industry losses starting
at A$500 million ($504 million), a growers group said. Output
from India may be less than predicted after heavy rains, a
producer organization said. Prices have more than doubled since
the end of June.  “The cyclone is the story,” said Jason Cole, a broker at
Starsupply Renewables SA in Geneva. An extended rally will
depend on the severity of the damage, he said.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 1.35 cents, or 4
percent, to settle at 35.31 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . Earlier, the price reached 36.08
cents, the highest for a most-active contract since November
1980.  In  London , refined-sugar futures for March delivery rose
$25.30, or 3.1 percent, to $844.50 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.
Earlier, the price reached $857, the highest since at least
January 1989.  Yasi, the first category 5 cyclone to hit Queensland since
1918, has been downgraded to category 3, Australia’s Bureau of
Meteorology said.  Prices of corn, wheat, soybeans, rice, livestock, coffee
and cocoa have rallied this year, spurring governments to boost
inventories as food inflation accelerates from  China  to Egypt.
Adverse weather in the past 12 months slashed crops from Russia
to Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
