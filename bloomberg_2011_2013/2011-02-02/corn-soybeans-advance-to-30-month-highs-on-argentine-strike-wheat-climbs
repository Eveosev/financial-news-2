Corn and soybeans rose to 30-month
highs in  Chicago  as a strike by port workers in  Argentina 
disrupted crop shipments. Rice climbed to the highest price in
13 months.  Argentine port workers, who have been on strike since last
week, are blocking between 20 and 30 soybean- and grain-hauling
ships from the country’s main terminals, Alberto Jacobson, head
of the San Lorenzo Chamber of Commerce, said yesterday.  “A significant amount of vessels are unable to load with
grain and oilseed exports,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , said by phone from
Sydney today. “Buyers will continue to turn to the U.S.”  Corn for March delivery gained 4.75 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $6.7075 a bushel at 10:49 a.m.  London  time on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The grain touched $6.715, the highest price for
a most-active contract since July 17, 2008.  Soybeans for March delivery climbed 9.5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $14.475 a bushel after reaching $14.52, the highest
price since July 18, 2008.  Wheat advanced, erasing yesterday’s drop, on speculation
that North African countries may boost imports of the grain as
storms hit parts of the U.S., the world’s largest exporter, and
Australia.  Wheat for March delivery gained 14.75 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $8.505 a bushel after losing 0.6 percent yesterday.
The grain has climbed 7.1 percent this year on increased demand.
Milling wheat for March delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris
added 1.3 percent to 272.50 euros ($377.05) a metric ton.  March-delivery rice advanced for a third day in Chicago,
gaining 16.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $16.10 per 100 pounds, the
highest price for the most-active contract since Dec. 16, 2009.
Global demand is forecast by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
to outstrip output this year for the first time in four years.  Plantings in the U.S., the third-largest shipper, may drop
25 percent this year from a year earlier, according to a
Bloomberg News survey published on Jan. 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
