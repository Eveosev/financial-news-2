Four days before the  Super Bowl 
between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Green Bay Packers, tickets
to the game are being resold for an average of $4,683, almost
twice as much as a year ago.  The popularity and history of the teams has helped drive up
ticket demand and prices for the National Football League’s
championship, scheduled for Feb. 6 at Cowboys Stadium in
Arlington,  Texas . The Packers and Steelers have nine Super Bowl
titles between them, and ranked third and fourth in a 2010
Harris Interactive Poll of the most popular NFL franchises.  The cheapest Super Bowl tickets available are $2,309,
according to  FanSnap.com , a Palo Alto, California-based Internet
search engine that compares prices at the 24 ticket-reselling
websites that have seats.  At this time last year, Super Bowl tickets between the  New
Orleans Saints  and Indianapolis Colts were selling for an
average of $2,420, according to FanSnap.  The attendance for last season’s Super Bowl at Sun Life
Stadium in Miami was 74,059. The capacity for this year’s game
will exceed 100,000, NFL Director of Event Operations Bill
McConnell said last week during a media briefing at the Dallas
Cowboys’ $1.1 billion stadium that opened in 2009.  Tickets to the championship game have a face value ranging
from $600 to $1,200. When the first Super Bowl was played 44
years ago, the highest ticket price was $12.  Super Bowl ticket searches in  Wisconsin  -- the home of the
Packers -- have thus far exceeded those from  Pennsylvania  by a
3-1 margin, FanSnap said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
