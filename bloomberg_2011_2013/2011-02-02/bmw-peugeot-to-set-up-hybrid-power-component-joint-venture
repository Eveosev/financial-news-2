  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, and PSA Peugeot Citroen
are setting up a joint venture to develop and produce hybrid-
power components and software in an effort to cut supply costs.  The 50-50 partnership, to be named BMW Peugeot Citroen
Electrification, will begin operating in the second quarter and
provide parts for both manufacturers’ vehicles starting in 2014,
the companies said today in a joint statement. The project will
be run by Wolfgang Guellich, BMW’s head of purchasing strategy,
and Jean Leflour, chief of customer satisfaction at Peugeot.  “This cooperative venture will enable us to achieve
significant economies of scale in the field of
electrification,” BMW Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer 
said in the statement. “It also represents an important step on
the road to sustainable mobility.”  BMW, which has its headquarters in Munich, has cooperated
since 2006 on engines with Paris-based Peugeot,  Europe ’s second-
biggest carmaker. In February 2010, the manufacturers said they
would develop 4-cylinder gasoline engines that conform with the
latest European Union environmental rules. The venture announced
today follows a memorandum of understanding on hybrid-power
technology development signed in October.  BMW Peugeot Citroen Electrification will involve suppliers
in the development process and may sell products to other
manufacturers, the carmakers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
