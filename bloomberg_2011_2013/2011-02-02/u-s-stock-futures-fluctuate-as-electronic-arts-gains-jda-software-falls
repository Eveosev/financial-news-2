Most U.S. stocks fell, with the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropping from near its highest
valuation since June, as earnings reports from companies
including  Broadcom Corp . and  Aflac Inc . disappointed investors
and anti-government protests in  Egypt  worsened.  Broadcom slumped 5.6 percent after the biggest maker of
chips for television set-top boxes reported margins that missed
analysts’ estimates. Aflac, the world’s largest seller of
supplemental health insurance, dropped 2.4 percent as operating
income trailed forecasts.  Electronic Arts Inc ., the second-
biggest U.S. video-game maker, jumped 16 percent and  Time Warner
Inc . rose 8.6 percent after profits beat projections.  About four stocks declined for every three that rose on
U.S. exchanges. The S&P 500 retreated 0.3 percent to 1,304.02 at
4 p.m. in New York after yesterday reaching a level that was
15.7 times its companies’ reported operating income. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  advanced 1.81 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 12,041.97.  “You need to be somewhat skeptical at this stage,” said  Michael Nasto , senior trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc.,
which manages about $3 billion in  San Antonio . “We’ve had a
very sharp stock rally. It’s not surprising that we see the
market moving either sideways or lower. There’s concern about
geopolitical risks. There’s been improvement in both economic
data and earnings. However, you’d need to see stronger figures
to push stocks higher.”  Earnings  U.S. stocks rose yesterday, pushing the Dow to its first
close above 12,000 since June 2008, after American and Chinese
manufacturing expanded and United Parcel Service Inc. beat
analysts’ earnings estimates. About 72 percent of the 226
companies in the S&P 500 that reported results since Jan. 10
topped earnings-per-share projections, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Political turmoil is spreading throughout the Middle East,
helping send Brent crude oil above $100 a barrel this week. The
cost of insuring sovereign debt of Egypt rose 40 basis points to
382, according to CMA prices for credit-default swaps.  “There is a real risk that it will spill over” into the
economy, said  Joseph Stiglitz , a 2001 Nobel laureate and an
economics professor at  Columbia University  in  New York , in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with Betty Liu. “It’s only when the oil exports get affected that the
effect will become very significant.”  Oil  Oil prices at current levels will increase airline costs by
more than this year’s projected earnings, threatening the
industry’s return to profitability, the  International Air
Transport Association  said. The IATA on Dec. 14 forecast
carriers would log net income of $9.1 billion in 2011 based on
oil at $84 a barrel. With crude trading $7 higher than that and
every $1 increase boosting the fuel bill by $1.6 billion, costs
could increase by $11 billion.  The  NYSE Arca Airline  Index lost 2.5 percent. Delta Air
Lines Inc. retreated 3.7 percent to $11.35. AMR Corp. slumped
2.1 percent to $7.03.  Broadcom lost 5.6 percent to $43.80. Fourth-quarter gross
margin -- the percentage of sales left after subtracting
production costs -- was 50.9 percent. That compared with the
51.6 percent average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  Aflac dropped 2.4 percent to $57.10. Operating income,
which excludes some investment results, was $1.33 a share in the
fourth quarter, missing the average estimate of $1.35 from
analysts. Realized investment losses were $191 million in the
fourth quarter, compared with $307 million a year earlier.  Genworth    Genworth Financial Inc . declined 8.5 percent to $12.76. The
mortgage guarantor and life insurer swung to a fourth-quarter
loss on $350 million in costs tied to backing home loans as
fewer borrowers return to compliance. The operating loss, which
excludes some investment results, was 28 cents a share, missing
the average analyst estimate for a 16-cent profit.  Companies in the U.S. added more workers than forecast to
payrolls in January, data from a private report showed today.
Employment rose 187,000 last month after a revised 247,000 gain
in December that was less than initially estimated, according to
figures from ADP Employer Services. The median estimate in the
Bloomberg News survey called for a 140,000 gain last month.  The ADP report is “roughly equivalent to the level
recorded in January 2004, which was two months before the
explosive March 2004 non-farm payroll release that proved a  turning point  in the monetary policy conducted” by Federal
Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan ,  Michael Shaoul , whose $415.7
million Marketfield Fund Ltd. outperformed 86 percent of rivals
in 2010, wrote in an e-mail to clients.  The  U.S. economy  added a revised 338,000 jobs in March
2004, the most since 2000. Nonfarm payrolls increased 140,000
last month, according to the median economist forecast in a
Bloomberg survey before the Labor Department report on Feb. 4.  Electronic Arts  Electronic Arts gained 16 percent to $18.09. Third-quarter
profit increased to 59 cents a share, excluding some items,
exceeding the average 56-cent average estimate analysts in a
survey. Sales, excluding changes in deferred revenue, came to
$1.41 billion, compared with the $1.43 billion average estimate
of analysts.  Time Warner gained 8.6 percent to $35.10. Fourth-quarter
profit, excluding some items, rose to 67 cents a share, topping
the 62-cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Time
Warner increased its dividend 11 percent and boosted its share-
buyback program by $4 billion, according to a statement from the
New York-based company today.    MEMC Electronic Materials Inc . gained 15 percent to $13.42.
The maker of wafers for the semiconductor and solar industries
forecast 2011 earnings may be as high as $1.30 a share, compared
with the average analyst estimate of $1.01.  “We’re participating but not afraid to hunker down,” said
Scott Armiger, portfolio manager at Christiana Trust in
Greenville,  Delaware , which has $6.8 billion in client assets.
“The stock market had been overreacting on the good news and
underreacting on the bad news. That explains the huge run-up
that we’ve had. Earnings reports were good with occasional
misses. I’m cautiously optimistic on stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
