  Vale SA , the worldâ€™s biggest iron-ore
producer, agreed to buy palm oil producer Biopalma da Amazonia
SA Reflorestamento Industria & Comercio for $173.5 million as it
seeks to run more of its Brazil operations on biodiesel.  Biopalma will start producing the oil this year and will be
generating 500,000 tons of it in 2019, Vale, based in  Rio de
Janeiro , said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Vale will turn the oil into biodiesel and run its fleet of
trains and other machinery on a 20 percent blend of the fuel
with regular diesel, according to the statement.  In April 2009, both companies formed a consortium to
produce palm oil.  Biopalma owns six  palm oil  plantations covering 18,400
hectares (45,467 acres) in the northern Amazon forest state of
Para, Vale said.  By 2013, there will be 60,000 hectares of plantations,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
