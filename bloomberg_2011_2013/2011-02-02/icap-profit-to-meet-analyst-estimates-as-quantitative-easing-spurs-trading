  ICAP Plc , the world’s largest broker
of transactions between banks, said it expects full-year profit
to be within the range of analysts’ predictions.  Pretax profit, ICAP’s preferred measure of performance, for
the fiscal year ending March 31 will be within the range of a
previous forecast of 333 million pounds ($583 million) to 357
million pounds, the London-based broker said in a statement.  ICAP said government efforts to stimulate the economy,
particularly the  Federal Reserve ’s $600 billion bond-buying
program known as quantitative easing, stoked price volatility
and spurred trading. The broker benefits when price fluctuations
increase because more customers use its services.  “ICAP has continued to benefit from volatility in
financial markets driven by quantitative easing and imbalances
in the global economy,” Chief Executive Officer  Michael Spencer 
said in the statement. “We are well positioned in markets that
are active and remain focused on the disciplined execution of
our strategy.”  ICAP fell as much as 14.5 pence, or 2.65 percent, to 533.5
and were 1.5 percent down as of 10:46 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
