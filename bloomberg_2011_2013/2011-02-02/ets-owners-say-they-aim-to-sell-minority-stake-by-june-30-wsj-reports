The  New York Mets ’ owners will try to
sell a stake in the team by June 30 to fund a possible
settlement involving investments in Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi
scheme, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a person familiar
with the transaction.  Owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz met yesterday with Major
League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig to discuss plans to sell
as much as 25 percent of the team, the Journal said.  Sterling Equities Inc., the owner of the Mets, Mets LP and
the Wilpons were sued by the trustee liquidating the Madoff
business, Irving Picard, on Dec. 7 in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Manhattan. Picard is seeking more than $300 million in profits
taken by the entities and people who own the team, the Journal
said.  Lawyers for the Mets’ owners called “baseless” the
trustee’s allegations that Madoff’s friends overlooked signs
that they were investing in a  Ponzi scheme , the Journal said,
citing court papers filed Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
