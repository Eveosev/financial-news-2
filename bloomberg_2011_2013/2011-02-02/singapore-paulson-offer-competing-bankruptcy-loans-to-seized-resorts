The Grand Wailea Resort Hotel & Spa 
in  Hawaii  and four other luxury resorts in bankruptcy received
two competing loan offers, one from the Singapore government, a
lawyer for the properties’ owner said.  Paulson & Co., a New York-based hedge fund that seized the
resorts in a foreclosure auction last week, offered the other
loan with Five Mile Capital Partners LLC, said Paul Basta, a
lawyer for MSR Resort Golf Course LLC. Singapore’s government
already is invested in two mezzanine loans in the company valued
at $250 million and $110 million.  MSR will consider both offers for a so-called debtor-in-
possession loan to fund the resorts in bankruptcy, Basta told
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean H. Lane at a hearing today in  Manhattan . MSR will work with adviser Houlihan Lokey Howard &
Zukin Capital Inc. for the next 30 days on the issue, he said.  “We’ll be back to court very soon with a proposal for
financing that’s the best we’re able to obtain,” Basta, who is
with law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP, said.  Paulson is part of a joint venture with  Winthrop Realty
Trust  and Capital Trust Inc., CNL-AB LLC, that seized the
resorts from  Morgan Stanley ’s real estate funds on Jan. 28. The
resorts filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy yesterday, listing $2.2
billion in assets and $1.9 billion in debt as of Nov. 30.  Lane separately approved the resorts’ request to use
lenders’ cash collateral on an interim basis.  The lead case is In re MSR Resort Golf Course LLC, 11-
10372,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
