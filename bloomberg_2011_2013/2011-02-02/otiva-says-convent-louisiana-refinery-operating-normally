Motiva Enterprises LLC said its
Convent refinery in  Louisiana  is operating normally after
workers made a precautionary report with the National Response
Center yesterday.  The NRC  filing  reported that a compressor tripped on the H-
oil unit, resulting in flaring at 12:10 a.m. local time, and
that a unit was in the process of being shut.  The refinery didn’t release hazardous substances in excess
of reportable quantities and production wasn’t affected, Jill Davis, a spokeswoman for the company based in Houston, said in a
telephone interview. No process units were shut, according to
Davis.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
