  Zimbabwe  will order foreign mining
companies to sell a majority stake to local blacks according to
regulations to be published this month, Indigenisation and
Empowerment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere said.  The regulations will stipulate that 100 percent of
alluvial  diamond mines  should be locally owned, while other
minerals must be 51 percent owned by Zimbabweans, Kasukuwere
said in a statement published today in the Harare-based, state-
run Herald newspaper. New mining projects must also be 51
percent held by locals and the government won’t give
“empowerment credits” for social initiatives, he said.  “Work is at an advanced stage to finalize consultations on
the mining sector with a view to publishing the gazette for the
sector not later than the end of February 2011,” Kasukuwere
said.  Mining production declined during a decade-long political
and economic crisis which eased in 2009 and the southern African
nation’s Chamber of Mines has said the industry needs about $5
billion investment to get back to pre-crisis levels. Zimbabwe
has the world’s second largest platinum reserves, after  South
Africa . Alluvial diamonds were found in Marange, on the eastern
border with  Mozambique . The regulations will put into effect the
Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act signed into law in
2008.  Mining output, which grew by 47 percent in 2010, is set to
grow by a further 44 percent this year, according to the  Reserve
Bank  of Zimbabwe.  ---Editors: Gordon Bell, Philip Sanders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
