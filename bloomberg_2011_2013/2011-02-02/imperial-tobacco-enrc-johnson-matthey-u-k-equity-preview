to pay more in dividends and reporting higher sales. ENRC

fourth-quarter ferroalloy output advanced 5.6 percent.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  advanced 42.25, or 0.7
percent, to 6,000.07 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, extending

January employment report, which economists said may show
payrolls grew by 142,000 workers after a 103,000 gain in

it will take years for the job market to recover from the
recession. The release may also show the jobless rate increased
to 9.5 percent from 9.4 percent.  Stocks climbed around the world yesterday, sending the FTSE
100 up the most in a month, after reports showed manufacturing

prompted a call from U.S. President Barack Obama for the
transition to “begin now.”    Imperial Tobacco   Imperial Tobacco surged 5.9 percent to 1,900 pence, the

million.    GKN Plc , a U.K. maker of aircraft components, retreated 4.9
