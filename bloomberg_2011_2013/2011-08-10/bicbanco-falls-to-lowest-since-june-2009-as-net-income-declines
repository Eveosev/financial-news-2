Banco Industrial e Comercial SA (BICB3) , the
Sao Paulo-based lender known as BicBanco, tumbled to its lowest
price in more than two years after reporting second-quarter
profit declined from a year earlier.  Shares dropped 5.5 percent to 7 reais at the close of Sao
Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the lowest since June
2009. They earlier plunged as much as 8.9 percent. The Bovespa
index climbed 0.5 percent to 51,395.29.  BicBanco reported “very weak numbers,” Bradesco Corretora
analysts including Carlos Firetti wrote in a note to clients. An
increase in provisions to cover bad loans was the main reason
for the “disappointing” figures, the analysts said.  BicBanco reported second-quarter net income of 66.9 million
reais ($41.4 million), a 32 percent decline from a year earlier,
according to a regulatory filing. The lender also said it spent
136.5 million reais in credit-loss provisions in the second
quarter, up from 35.7 reais million a year before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
