The strength of South Africa’s rand
is the single biggest concern for the nation’s manufacturers,
 Business Report said , citing  Rob Davies , the minister of trade
and industry.  Manufacturers are also concerned about the level of
government and utility-set prices and the number of strikes, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing the minister.  The application to review South Africa’s approval of Wal-
Mart Stores Inc.’s purchase of a controlling stake in  Massmart
Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  is to protect the manufacturing industry, even at
the expense of the consumer, the newspaper said, citing Davies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
