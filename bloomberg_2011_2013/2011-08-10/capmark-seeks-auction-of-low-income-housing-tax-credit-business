Capmark Financial Group Inc., the
bankrupt commercial lender, wants to hold an auction next month
to sell the remaining assets in its low-income housing tax-
credit business.  Bear Creek Multi-Family Investments LLLP agreed to buy some
assets for $92.7 million, according to papers filed yesterday in
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Wilmington, Delaware. Capmark asked a
judge to approve a Sept. 15 auction to seek a better bid and a
Sept. 21 hearing to approve the results.  Capmark, part-owned by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , filed for
bankruptcy protection in October 2009 with debt of about
$21 billion. While in bankruptcy, the Horsham, Pennsylvania-
based company sold its loan-servicing unit to Warren Buffettâ€™s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Leucadia National Corp. in a deal
valued at $468 million.  The low-income housing tax-credit business, known as LIHTC
syndication, finances and sells interests in affordable-housing
properties to institutional investors, according to court
papers.  The case is In re Capmark Financial Group Inc., 09-13684,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
