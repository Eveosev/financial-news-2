Israel’s benchmark stock index slid
to the lowest level in almost two years on concern the global
economic slowdown will hurt corporate profits.  Partner Communications Co., Israel’s second-largest mobile-
phone company, skidded to the lowest in more than five years.
 Discount Investment Corp. (DISI) , billionaire Nochi Dankner’s holding
company, tumbled 20 percent. The TA-25 Index slumped 2.8 percent
to 1,059.68 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , the lowest since
November 2009. The gauge has retreated 21 percent from the
record close of 1,341.89 on April 21. A loss of 20 percent or
more signals a so-called  bear market  to some investors.  “There’s still a lot of panic in the market because of
uncertainty about the global economy and what that means for
company revenues,” said Amir Kahanovich, chief economist at
Clal Finance Investment Management Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Investors
are still trying to figure out what’s going on with the Fed
announcement and what the Bank of  Israel  will do locally.”  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  vowed yesterday to
keep borrowing costs at an all-time low to revive a recovery
that’s “considerably slower” than expected. The  Bank of
Israel , which in July held the benchmark  interest rate  at 3.25
percent for a second month after 10 increases in two years, on
Aug. 2 cut its growth forecasts for 2011 and 2012, saying debt
reduction plans in developed countries may lead to a global
slowdown.  ‘No Dividend’  The 25 companies on Israel’s benchmark are valued at an
average 9.7 times estimated earnings, according to Bloomberg
data. That compares with 10.9 times for the MSCI World Index.  Partner slid 8.6 percent to 38.39 shekels, the lowest since
July 2006. The company reported second-quarter net income fell
30 percent to 205 million shekels ($58 million) and said it
expects net income in the second half to be “significantly
lower” than the second half of 2010. It said it won’t pay a
dividend for the second quarter.  “The company’s board of directors resolved not to
distribute a dividend at this time, in light of the significant
increase in the level of uncertainty in the global economy and
the Israeli economy and the changes in the Israeli telecom
market and their impact on Partner,” Chief Executive Officer
Yacov Gelbard said.  Lower Valuation  Discount Investment tumbled 20 percent to 26.05 shekels,
the biggest decline since October 2008.  Koor Industries Ltd. (KOR) ,
which is 63 percent-owned by Discount, said it will record a
second-quarter loss of about 1.8 billion shekels related to the
decline in the value of its investment in  Credit Suisse Group
AG. (CSGN)  Discount’s share of the loss will be 1.1 billion shekels,
Koor said.  Koor shares slumped 16 percent to 36.50 shekels, the lowest
since January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
