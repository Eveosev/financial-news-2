Kenya , experiencing a drought that
has curbed food production, plans to import 12 million 90-
kilogram (198-pound) bags of corn by February to meet demand for
the staple food, the Agriculture Ministry said.  The East African country is expected to produce 24 million
bags of the grain in the current harvest that ends in February,
Romano Kiome, permanent secretary at the ministry, told
reporters today in Nairobi, the capital. Annual consumption is
36 million bags, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
