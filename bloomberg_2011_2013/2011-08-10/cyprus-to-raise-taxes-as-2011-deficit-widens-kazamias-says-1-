Cypriot Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias is preparing to raise taxes to plug a budget gap that
will be wider than estimated this year after a power plant blast
knocked out more than half the island’s electricity.  “With the present situation, if nothing changes the fiscal
deficit will be 6.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2011,”
Kazamias said in Parliament in Nicosia today. The previous
target had been for a shortfall of 4.5 percent, he said.  Cyprus, struggling to avoid becoming the latest victim of
 Europe ’s debt crisis, had its long-term foreign and local
currency issuer default ratings cut to ‘BBB’ from ’A-’ by
 Fitch Ratings  today. The move by Fitch, which cited the nation’s
economy and concerns the country will have difficulty raising
funds in international debt markets, followed downgrades last
month by Moody’s Investors Service and  Standard & Poor’s .  President Demetris Christofias, seeking to restore investor
confidence, reshuffled his Cabinet last week after a July 11
explosion knocked out the 767-megawatt Vasilikos power plant.  Kazamias said that his proposed austerity measures, which
will amount to 600 million euros ($852 million), or 3.5 percent
of GDP next year, will help keep the deficit at 2.5 percent in
2012. He asked lawmakers to help design a second fiscal package
to be part of the 2012 budget.  Raising Rates  Kazamias said he wants to raise tax rates on bank-deposit
interest to 15 percent from 10 percent and to 17 percent from 15
percent on dividends. Raising the interest  tax rate  will bring
in 20 million euros ($28.8 million) in 2011 and 30 million euros
in 2012, while a further 15 million euros will come from the
dividend rate hike, he said.  The minister also said he plans to increase the tax rate
for incomes over 60,000 euros a year by 5 percentage points to
35 percent. He didn’t estimate that move’s impact on revenue.  The ministry is also drawing up a bill to raise the value-
added tax rate for non-food and non-medicine items to 17 percent
from 15 percent, which will bring in 20 million euros in 2011
and 130 million euros in 2012, he said.  “Its inflationary impact will be excluded from wage
indexation in the public sector,” Kazamias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
