The biggest plunge in stocks in more
than two years is prompting U.S. options traders to pay the
lowest prices for bearish contracts compared with bullish ones
since December 2009.  The premium investors paid for three-month puts to sell the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index versus call options to buy dropped
to 50 percent yesterday from 84 percent on July 19, a period
when as much as $2.5 trillion was erased from the value of
global equities. The  S&P 500  has rallied 6.3 percent on average
in the month after the gap narrowed more than 10 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg since 2005.  Speculation that record profits and the lowest valuations
in two years will limit losses is reducing the options price
relationship known as skew. The benchmark gauge for U.S.
equities climbed 4.7 percent yesterday, rebounding from a 6.7
percent decline on Aug. 8 after S&P cut the U.S. government’s
AAA  credit rating  to AA+. U.S. equity strategists forecast the
index will gain 18 percent by January.  “The contrarian would say the more panic and blood in
streets, the fewer people left to sell and therefore the closer
you are to a bottom,”  Bob Doll , chief equity strategist at New
York-based BlackRock Inc., which manages $3.66 trillion, said in
a telephone interview yesterday. “When you see the volume and
the skewness that we’ve seen, I could see it as a bullish
sign.”  Slowing Economy  The S&P 500 has declined 13 percent since July 22 on
speculation the world’s largest economy is slowing and European
policy makers will fail to keep their debt crisis from
spreading. The losses accelerated when S&P reduced its credit
rating, conflicting with Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch
Ratings, which reaffirmed their highest rating on Treasuries.
Trading volume was a 2011 record 18 billion shares in the U.S.
yesterday, when the S&P 500 rallied 4.7 percent.  The S&P 500 declined 4.4 percent to 1,120.76 as of 4 a.m.
in  New York , erasing almost all of yesterday’s 4.7 percent
advance that was the biggest jump since March 2009.  In options, three-month S&P 500 puts to sell if the index
declines 10 percent have an implied volatility of 35.42 versus
23.68 for the equivalent calls. A month ago, volatility on the
puts was 21.21 and 12.01 on the calls. Volatility is the key
gauge of option prices. With those puts costing 67 percent more
than they did a month ago, traders are paying a higher price to
shield stocks from losses.  “The fear has been priced in, and people are taking their
hedges off,” Sean Heron, who manages options strategies at
Glenmede Trust Co., said in a telephone interview yesterday. The
Philadelphia-based firm oversees $20 billion. “People are
recognizing that valuations are compelling and they’d rather
sell their puts because this too shall pass.”  Climbing VIX  While the price of bearish options is falling relative to
bullish ones, the VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index is known, shows that options dealers are still
charging some of the highest prices in a year for hedges.  The VIX soared 50 percent to 48 on Aug. 8 for the biggest
gain since February 2007. The gauge of S&P 500 options plunged
27 percent yesterday to 35.06 for the second-largest drop ever,
after the  Federal Reserve  said it had tools to revive economic
growth. The VIX has averaged 20.35 over its 21-year history.  The decline in the S&P 500 sent its price-earnings ratio
down 17 percent since July 22, the biggest decrease since July
2010. The index trades at 12.8 times profit for the past year,
the lowest valuation since the  bull market  began in March 2009.
The average multiple since 1954 is 16.4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Analyst Estimates  S&P 500 earnings are beating analyst estimates by 5.1
percent, increasing at an average 17 percent rate for the
quarter ending June 30. Wall Street firms project profits will
climb 18 percent this year to $99.42 a share, the highest level
on record, according to data compiled by S&P and Bloomberg.  Chief strategists at 13 banks from Barclays Plc to UBS AG
see the benchmark measure of American equity surging 18 percent
through Dec. 31 to 1,389, the average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. A year ago, strategists also remained bullish after a 14
percent drop, and proved prescient as the S&P 500 rallied 20
percent from its August low.  “From a valuations and earnings perspective, there’s
tremendous opportunity in the market today,” Matthew Rubin, the
New York-based director of investment strategy at Neuberger
Berman Group LLC, said in a telephone interview yesterday. The
firm manages more than $198 billion in assets. “If you’re able
to look through this and weather the storm, you can find great
companies.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
