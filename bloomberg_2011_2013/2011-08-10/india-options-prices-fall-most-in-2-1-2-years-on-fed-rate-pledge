Options prices in  India  fell the
most in 2 1/2 years, reversing yesterday’s surge to a 14-month
high, after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  pledged to
keep interest rates at record lows to stimulate economic growth.  The India VIX, which gauges the cost of buying protection
against losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, fell 15.4 percent to
29.5, the most since Jan. 23, 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. VIX surged 82 percent in five days before today.  “It’s been a roller-coaster ride,” Siddarth Bhamre, head
of equity derivatives at Angel Broking Ltd., said by phone from
Mumbai. “Investors should sell options as implied volatility is
likely to drop further. The market will trade in a range.”  The Fed pledged yesterday to keep  interest rates  near zero
through mid-2013 and discussed a range of policy tools to boost
economic growth. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced the
most since March 2009 yesterday, rebounding from a 6.7 percent
slump on Aug. 8 triggered by S&P cutting the U.S.’s AAA rating.  A global selloff in equities yesterday dragged the Bombay
Stock Exchange Sensitive Index down 20 percent from its Nov. 5
peak, the level that marks a so-called  bear market  for some
investors. The index rebounded 2 percent to 17,193.92 at 10:06
a.m. in Mumbai.  -- Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
