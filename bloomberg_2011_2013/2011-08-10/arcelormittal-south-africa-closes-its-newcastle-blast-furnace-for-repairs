ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. (ACL) , the
continent’s largest steelmaker, said a “structural failure” at
the gas cleaning plant of its Newcastle operation in South
Africa has rendered its blast furnace inoperable.  Repairs are expected to be completed in two months and re-
commissioning will then take a further two weeks to resume full
production, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The mills will continue to produce, with available
stock” until the third week of August,  ArcelorMittal (MT)  South
Africa said. “We are in the process of exploring options to
augment the supply to meet the domestic customer requirements
for the next two months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
