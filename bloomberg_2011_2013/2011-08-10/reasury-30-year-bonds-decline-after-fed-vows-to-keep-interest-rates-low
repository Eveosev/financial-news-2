Treasury 30-year bonds fell,
snapping a two-day rally, on speculation the  Federal Reserve ’s
pledge to keep interest rates at a record low will lead to
faster inflation over the life of the securities.  Shorter maturities, which are more sensitive to what the
central bank does with its target for overnight loans between
banks, were little changed. The Treasury is scheduled to sell
$24 billion of 10-year notes today and $16 billion of 30-year
debt tomorrow.  “The Fed committed to keeping rates low,” said Tomohisa Fujiki, a bond strategist at BNP Paribas Securities  Japan  Ltd.
in Tokyo. “Shorter maturities should be well-supported. With
any pickup in economic sentiment, longer maturities will be
vulnerable to higher inflation.”  Thirty-year yields climbed three basis points to 3.64
percent as of 9:40 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 4.375 percent security maturing in May 2041
fell 1/2, or $5 per $1,000 face amount, to 113 6/32. Ten-year
notes yielded 2.24 percent.  Japan’s 10-year bond yield was little changed at 1.035
percent. The rate dropped to 0.975 percent on Aug. 9, the lowest
level this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
