Cash premiums for U.S. soybeans
shipped in August to export terminals near  New Orleans  rose
relative to Chicago futures on signs of increased demand from
domestic processors. The corn basis weakened.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 58 cents to 64 cents a bushel above November futures,
up from 57 cents to 60 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The corn premium fell to 78 cents to 80
cents a bushel above September futures from 78 cents to 81
cents.  “It’s mostly a processor-driven market at this point,”
 Dave Marshall , a farm-market adviser at Toay commodity Futures
Group LLC in Nashville,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview.
“Exporters have to fight processors for soybeans right now.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 1.75 cents, or
0.1 percent, to close at $13.015 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the first gain for the contract since Aug. 2.  Corn futures for September delivery fell 0.25 cent to $6.78
a bushel on the CBOT, declining for the fifth time in six
sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
