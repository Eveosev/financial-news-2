BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the operator of
 Latin America ’s biggest securities exchange, said second-quarter
profit fell 3.8 percent as  Brazil ’s market rout reduced trading
volumes.  Net income excluding some items dropped to 294.2 million
reais ($185.1 million) from 305.6 million reais a year earlier,
the Sao Paulo-based company said in a regulatory filing. That
compares to an average forecast of 350.6 million reais in a
Bloomberg survey of seven analysts. Net operating revenue fell
1.7 percent to 467.64 million reais.  The exchange operator has slumped 36 percent this year amid
concern government measures to stem the real’s gains, including
a 1 percent tax on some currency derivatives trades, will hurt
volumes. That compares to a 26 percent decline for the benchmark
Bovespa index. The company’s stock also suffered as the
Brazilian equity market entered a  bear market  last month on
concern quickening domestic inflation and slowing global growth
will cut into corporate earnings.  “It is still too early to assess the impacts of new
government measures on futures volumes, although it seems clear
there will be a negative impact on them,” analysts at Banco
Bradesco SA including Carlos Firetti wrote in an Aug. 1 note to
clients. “A major recovery in volumes would be the main trigger
for the stock, but global uncertainties plus vacations in the
North Hemisphere should prevent this in the short term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
