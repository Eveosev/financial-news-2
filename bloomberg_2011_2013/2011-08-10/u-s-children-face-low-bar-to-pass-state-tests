Almost all states give children math
and reading proficiency exams using standards that fall short of
federal benchmarks, even after eight raised their requirements
since 2007, a U.S. Department of Education study found.  Indiana ,  Oklahoma ,  West Virginia  and five other states
raised their standards on at least one test of reading or math
in fourth or eighth grades between 2007 and 2009, according to a
report released today. South Carolina lowered the bar on all
exams.  The study comes after U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan
expressed concern that states dumb down annual proficiency tests
so they can qualify for federal money under the nation’s main
public education law. The No Child Left Behind law requires that
all students be proficient in math and reading by 2014, leaving
each state free to define that measure. Duncan plans to let
states ignore the deadline if they agree to raise academic
standards and take other steps, he said Aug. 5.  “States need to aim higher for all students,” said
 Michael Cohen , president of Achieve Inc., a Washington-based
nonprofit created by governors and business leaders to raise
academic standards.  No Child Left Behind’s proficiency requirements create
“significant obstacles” to instituting rigorous academic
standards, Cohen, a former assistant secretary of education
under President  Bill Clinton , said in a telephone interview.  43 States Responded  The report comes as Duncan has already prodded 43 states
and the  District of Columbia  since last year to sign onto U.S.
academic standards proposed by the nation’s governors and school
chiefs.  The new study, which examined a period before that effort
gained steam, compared data from 2008-09 state assessments with
the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress, often
called “the nation’s report card.”  The Education Department report showed how a proficiency
score on a state test would translate into a score on the
federal exam, which is scored on a zero to 500-point scale.  Only  Massachusetts , which generally had the toughest
proficiency requirements, mandated a score that would be
considered proficient on most of the U.S. tests in the study.  A Massachusetts child in eighth-grade math would be
considered proficient with a state score equivalent to 300 on
the federal exam. A child in Tennessee, which had the lowest
standards, would need only 229, according to the report.  Reading a Graph  That means a Tennessee child could be considered proficient
without knowing how to read a graph, while a Massachusetts
student meeting that benchmark would likely be able to solve a
math problem using algebra and geometry.  Starting in 1993, Massachusetts revamped its assessments
and curriculum to make them tougher, and, as a result, state
students excel on national and international academic
assessments, said Mitchell Chester, the state’s commissioner of
elementary and secondary education.  “People don’t rise to low expectations,” Chester said in
a telephone interview. “They rise to high expectations.”  Tennessee  has since changed its test to raise standards,
said Kelli Gauthier, spokeswoman for the state’s Department of
Education.  ‘Perverse Incentives’  Duncan has cited the state as an example of what he called
the “perverse incentives” in No Child Left Behind. After
revamping its state test, the number of Tennessee students in
grades three through eight scoring proficient fell to 34 percent
from 91 percent, making schools more likely to be labeled
failing.  South Carolina had among the highest proficiency standards
in 2007, the last year the education department studied the
benchmarks. The state made the test easier to pass in 2008
because of concern so many schools were being labeled as failing
under No Child Left Behind, said Jay Ragley, a spokesman for the
 South Carolina  Department of Education.  Mick Zais, who became state superintendent in January,
considers that move a mistake, Ragley said in an interview.  “South Carolina’s proficiency standards must be increased
to challenge students and prepare them for success in life,” he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
