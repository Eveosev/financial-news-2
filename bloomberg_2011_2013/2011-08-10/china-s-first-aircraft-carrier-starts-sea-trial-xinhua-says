China’s refitted Soviet-era aircraft
carrier, which it said will be used for scientific research and
training, set sail today, Xinhua  News Agency  reported, citing
people in the military it didn’t identify.  The sea trial was “in line with schedule of the carrier’s
refitting project and would not take a long time,” the official
news agency said. The carrier left Dalian port in the
northeastern province of Liaoning, Xinhua reported.  China on July 28 officially confirmed it is pursuing a
carrier program, Xinhua reported at the time, citing Defense
Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng. The country is building two
more carriers at the Jiangnan shipyard in  Shanghai , Reuters said
separately, citing an unidentified person with ties to the
Communist Party leadership.  Chinese leaders have talked for decades of plans to acquire
what they call “aircraft mother ships” as part of their
military modernization. Such a fleet would expand  China ’s power
in the region at a time of growing concern that territorial
disputes with Asian neighbors including  Japan , Vietnam and the
Philippines may boil over into conflict.  --Daryl Loo. Editor: Ben Richardson, Stan James  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
