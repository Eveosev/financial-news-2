Major League Soccer  signed a three-
year national television contract with NBC Sports Group that
will begin with the 2012 season.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC and NBC Sports Network, which will be
re-branded from Versus in January, will televise 45 MLS games
and four U.S. men’s national soccer team matches per season, NBC
and MLS said in a joint news release.  Financial terms weren’t disclosed. The deal is worth $10
million per season, the Sports Business Journal reported, citing
unidentified people.  “MLS is a perfect fit for our new group, and we are
uniquely positioned to help grow soccer in the United States
with extensive coverage on NBC Sports Network, significant
programming on the broadcast network and our growing digital
platforms,” Mark Lazarus, chairman of NBC Sports Group, said in
a statement.  NBC will air two regular-season and two playoff games each
season as well as two national team games, while the cable
network will broadcast the other matches.  MLS already has local-coverage partnerships with five
Comcast Sportsnets:  California , Chicago, Mid-Atlantic, New
England and Philadelphia.  News Corp.’s Fox Soccer held the soccer league’s previous
television contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
