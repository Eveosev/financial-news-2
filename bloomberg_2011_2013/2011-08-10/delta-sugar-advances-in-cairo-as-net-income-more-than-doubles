Delta Sugar  gained for the first
time in four days after first-half profit for the biggest
publicly traded sugar refiner in  Egypt  more than doubled.  The shares of the Cairo-based company rose 1.9 percent to
21.52 Egyptian pounds at the 1:30 p.m. close in Cairo. That gave
Delta Sugar a market value of 2.66 billion pounds ($446
million). The benchmark EGX 30 Index surged 4.1 percent.  Net income for the period ended June 30 rose to 279.5
million pounds from 113.9 million pounds a year earlier, the
company said today. The stock has gained 16 percent since
trading resumed on the  Egyptian Exchange  after a near two-month
halt because of political unrest. That compares with a 17
percent decline for the  EGX 30 Index. (EGX30)   To contact the reporter on this story:
