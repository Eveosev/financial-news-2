The yuan rose to a 17-year high
after the  Federal Reserve  pledged to keep  interest rates  at a
record low and on speculation  China ’s central bank will allow
appreciation to temper inflation.  The currency strengthened the most in almost two months
after the Fed said yesterday it will hold the target rate near
zero for at least two years and use other policy tools “as
appropriate.” Yuan forward contracts posted the largest gain
since October after China reported its  trade surplus  surged to
the highest level in more than two years due to record exports.
Consumer prices climbed 6.5 percent last month, the fastest pace
in three years, the statistics bureau said yesterday.  “The Fed pledge and concerns over the U.S. recovery mean
the dollar will face more pressure,” said Kenix Lai, senior
market analyst at Bank of  East Asia  in Hong Kong. “China’s
inflation data suggests the country will appreciate the currency
more. Yuan appreciation is a better choice because it’s more
difficult to raise interest rates or banks’ reserve ratios with
all the uncertainties in the global market.”  The yuan rose 0.19 percent to close at 6.4181 per dollar as
of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency touched 6.4120 earlier, the
strongest level since the country unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Exports, Surplus  The People’s Bank of China set its daily yuan fixing 0.26
percent higher at 6.4167, the biggest increase since November.
The yuan is allowed to trade up to 0.5 percent on either side of
the official rate.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.36 percent
to 6.4120. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards jumped 0.7
percent to 6.3580. The contracts were at a 1 percent premium to
the onshore spot rate, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s outbound shipments climbed 20.4 percent from a year
earlier in July, compared with the 17 percent median forecast in
a Bloomberg News survey of 25 economists. Imports jumped 22.9
percent, the customs bureau said on its website today. The $31.5
billion trade surplus exceeded a median forecast of $27.4
billion.  “The higher-than-expected trade surplus has fuelled
expectations that the yuan will appreciate more,” Lai said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
