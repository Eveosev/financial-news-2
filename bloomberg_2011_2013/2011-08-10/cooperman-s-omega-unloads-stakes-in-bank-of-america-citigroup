Leon Cooperman, chief executive
officer of New York-based hedge fund Omega Advisors Inc., sold
all of his  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  holdings in
the second quarter as he reduced his financial stakes.  Cooperman sold 794,000 Citigroup shares and 2.54 million
Bank of America shares, according to a document filed today with
the U.S. Securities and Commission. He sold 247,000 shares of
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) , reducing his position to about 2 million
shares as of June 30.  The fund’s equity weighting in financial stocks decreased
by 3.6 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The firm’s weightings in energy, consumer discretionary and
health-care stocks increased. The fund bought 1.55 million
shares of  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  valued at $59.1 million, doubling its
stake with its largest position increase in terms of market
value. Cooperman purchased 4.15 million shares of natural-gas
pipeline owner  El Paso Corp. (EP) , his largest new stake.  Money managers overseeing more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F within 45 days of each quarter’s
end to show U.S.-listed stocks, options and convertible bonds.
The filings don’t show non-U.S. securities or how much cash the
firms hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
