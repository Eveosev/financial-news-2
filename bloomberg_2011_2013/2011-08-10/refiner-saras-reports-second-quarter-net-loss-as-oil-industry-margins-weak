Saras SpA (SRS) , the owner of the
Mediterranean region’s largest oil refinery, posted a net loss
of 40.6 million euros in the second quarter versus a profit of
21.1 million euros a year earlier, according to a statement
distributed by the Italian exchange.  Revenue rose 21 percent to 2.63 billion euros.  The impact of the Libyan crisis was “limited thanks to the
careful choices of crude supply,” said Chairman Gian Marco
Moratti. “The Libyan situation continues to represent a serious
worry,” Moratti said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
