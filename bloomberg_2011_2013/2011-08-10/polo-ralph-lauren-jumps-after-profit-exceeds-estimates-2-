Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL) , the
retailer of its namesake brand clothing, rose after first-
quarter profit topped analysts’ estimates.  Polo shares increased $5.43, or 4.5 percent, to $125.28 at
4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The New
York-based company’s shares have climbed 13 percent this year.  Net income in the three months ended July 2 climbed 52
percent to $184.1 million, or $1.90 a share, from $120.8
million, or $1.21, a year earlier, the company said today in a
statement. Nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey estimated $1.47 a
share, on average.  Revenue jumped 32 percent to $1.53 billion, driven by
global demand for men’s, women’s and children’s clothing as well
as accessories in the U.S. Polo’s sales were especially strong
in its own stores and in international markets, Chief Operating
Officer Roger Farah said in the statement. The average of seven
analysts’ estimates was $1.44 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
