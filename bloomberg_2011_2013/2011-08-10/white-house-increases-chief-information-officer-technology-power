The top technology officials at U.S.
agencies will have more power to manage spending on  information
systems  under an Obama administration policy aimed at keeping
projects on schedule and in budget.  Federal chief information officers will have greater
authority to review technology investments, eliminate redundant
programs, hire managers to oversee projects and implement
security programs for agency networks, according to an Aug. 8
White House memo.  The new responsibilities will mean “CIOs will be held
accountable for lowering operational costs, terminating and
turning around troubled projects and delivering meaningful
functionality at a faster rate while enhancing security of
information systems,” Jack Lew, director of the Office of
Management and Budget said in the memo, which was posted on an
OMB blog.  The change is part of a restructuring of government
information technology that began under former U.S. Chief
Information Officer Vivek Kundra. His successor, Steven VanRoekel, took over the post Aug. 5 and has vowed to continue
the initiative.  “These reforms were developed to remedy what had become
routine in  Washington : IT projects running over budget, falling
behind schedule, or failing to deliver promised functionality,
hampering agency missions and wasting taxpayer dollars,”
VanRoekel wrote in the  blog entry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
