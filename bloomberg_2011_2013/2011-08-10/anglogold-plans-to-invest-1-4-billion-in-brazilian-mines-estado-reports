AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  plans to
invest 2.24 billion reais ($1.4 billion) in building two mines
in the Brazilian state of  Minas Gerais  to produce gold and
sulfuric acid for exporting, O Estado de S. Paulo reported,
without citing anyone.  Helcio Guerra, chief executive officer of AngloGoldâ€™s
Brazilian unit, signed a letter of intent yesterday with
Governor Antonio Anastasia, which allocates 160 million reais of
investment to the Lamego mine near  Belo Horizonte  and 2.07
billion reais to the Corrego do Sitio mine in Santa Barbara, the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  AngloGold plans to produce 1.5 tons of gold and 20,000 tons
of sulfuric acid annually at the Lamego mine, which should be
working at capacity by the end of the year, O Estado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
