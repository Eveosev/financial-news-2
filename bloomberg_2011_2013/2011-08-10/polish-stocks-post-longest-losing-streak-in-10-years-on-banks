Poland’s benchmark stock index fell
for an eighth day, the longest losing streak since 2001, as
banks and commodity producers slumped after the  Federal
Reserve ’s plan to bolster the  U.S. economy  failed to ease
investors’ concern the recovery is stalling.  The WIG20 Index slid 5.2 percent to 2,194.07 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Warsaw, extending its slump from a 2011 high on
April 8 to 24 percent.  “What we’re seeing is total panic,” said Jaroslaw Lis,
who helps manage the equivalent of $2.9 billion at Warsaw-based
mutual fund Union Investment TFI SA. “People want to get rid of
shares because of the global uncertainty.”  PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s biggest bank, lost 5 percent
to 33.1 zloty, closing at the lowest level since October 2009,
and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , a unit of UniCredit SpA, tumbled 6.8 percent
to 129.5 zloty.  Bank Handlowy SA, a unit of Citigroup Inc., slid 9.5
percent to 62.45 zloty, extending yesterday’s drop of 8.2
percent after reporting second-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates.  Getin Holding SA, the financial-services group controlled
by Polish billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, fell 6.1 percent to 7.98
zloty, sliding for a 13th day, as the zloty extended losses
against the Swiss franc. Getin is among eastern European lenders
whose earnings are most vulnerable if a decline in the zloty
worsens the quality of Swiss franc-denominated home loan
portfolios, ING Groep NV said yesterday.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA, the country’s sole copper producer,
sank 5.1 percent to 159.5 zloty as the price of the metal
declined. PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s biggest oil company, tumbled
8.1 percent to 34.01 zloty, falling the most in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
