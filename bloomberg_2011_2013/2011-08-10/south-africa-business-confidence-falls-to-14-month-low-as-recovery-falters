South African business confidence
fell in July to its lowest in 14 months as the recovery in
 Africa ’s largest economy falters, the country’s Chamber of
Commerce and Industry said.  Its business confidence index fell to 99 from 102.4 in
June, after it was rebased the survey to 2010 from 2005, the
Johannesburg-based chamber, known as SACCI, said in an e-mailed
statement today. The index is compiled from 13 economic
indicators, including retail sales, inflation and financial
gauges, such as the  stock index  and the currency. Using its
previous calculation, the chamber said the BCI would have fallen
to 84 in July compared with 86.8 in June.  The deteriorating global economic outlook and South
Africa’s debate on mine nationalization “are likely to result
in slower economic growth and an inability for business to
contribute effectively to the national goals of  job creation  and
poverty alleviation,” the chamber said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
