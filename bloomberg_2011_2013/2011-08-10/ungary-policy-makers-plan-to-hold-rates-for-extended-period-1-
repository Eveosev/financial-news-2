Hungarian central bankers plan to
leave the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for an “extended
period” to slow inflation to within their target next year, the
minutes of last month’s rate-setting meeting show.  “The Monetary Council still considers that keeping the
current 6 percent interest rate unchanged for an extended period
can ensure the inflation rate falls to 3 percent on the
monetary-policy horizon,” according to the minutes, which were
posted on the central bank’s website today.  The  Magyar Nemzeti Bank  left borrowing costs at 6 percent
for a sixth month on July 26 as focus shifted from inflation to
the impact of Europe’s debt crisis on the economy. Hungarian
households, companies and local governments are struggling to
repay Swiss-franc loans as the currency’s haven status boosts
its value against the forint. Two-thirds of household loans and
half of corporate loans are denominated in foreign currencies.  The forint weakened to a record 272.624 per Swiss franc
yesterday. It has lost 19 percent against the franc this year
and traded at 265.39 at 3:05 p.m. in Budapest.  Policy makers considered several “channels” through which
 Europe ’s debt crisis may affect rate policy in “contradictory
ways,” according to the minutes.  Under one, rate cuts may be brought forward as a stronger
Swiss franc lowers the purchasing power of homeowners who took
mortgages in the Alpine country’s currency, slowing inflation.
Under another, Europe’s debt crisis may raise the risk premium
on Hungarian assets, weakening the forint and requiring higher
rates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
