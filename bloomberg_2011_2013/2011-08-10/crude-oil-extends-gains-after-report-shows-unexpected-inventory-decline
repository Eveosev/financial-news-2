Crude oil futures extended gains
after the U.S. Energy Department reported an unexpected decline
in inventories.  Supplies fell 5.23 million barrels to 349.8 million in the
week ended Aug. 5, the Energy Department said today in a weekly
report. Inventories were forecast to increase 1.35 million
barrels, according to the median of 12 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Crude oil for September delivery rose $1.88, or 2.4
percent, to $81.18 a barrel at 10:35 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Oil traded at $80.35 before the release of
the report at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.  Oil also increased as products advanced amid outages at
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Memphis refinery, which has been halted
since Aug. 5, and  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’s refinery at Ponca City,
Oklahoma, which has been shut since Aug. 8.  Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  said officials can
expand stimulus if the outlook for growth deteriorates further.
He spoke in London today as the bank released its quarterly
inflation report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
