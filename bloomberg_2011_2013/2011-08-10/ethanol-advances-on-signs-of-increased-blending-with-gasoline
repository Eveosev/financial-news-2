Ethanol futures advanced in  Chicago 
on signs of increased demand for the biofuel.  Futures rose after an Energy Department report showed
gasoline stockpiles fell 1.59 million barrels to 213.6 million.
Inventories of ethanol, which is blended with gasoline to
stretch supply, dropped 4 percent to 18.2 million barrels, the
lowest level since the week ended Jan. 14.  “It was tied a little bit to the energy sector,” said
Jack Lavalle, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in
Chicago. “You have a little sympathy for the ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery advanced 2.8 cents,
or 1 percent, to settle at $2.702 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Futures have risen 14 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  gained 3 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $2.86 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive increased 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.89, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago rose 0.5 cent to $2.735 and on the West
Coast the fuel was unchanged at $2.99.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
increased 1.7 percent to a record 5.3 million barrels a day, the
Energy Department reported. Refiners receive a 45-cent tax
credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Ethanol output rose to 908,000 barrels a day, the highest
level since June 3 and the steepest weekly increase since May
13, according to the department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
