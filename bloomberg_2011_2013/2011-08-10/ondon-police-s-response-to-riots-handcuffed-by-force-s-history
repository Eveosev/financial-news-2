London ’s Metropolitan Police have
endured three decades during which they’ve been accused of
institutional racism and inappropriate use of force. Yesterday
Londoners said they weren’t being aggressive enough in quelling
riots across the city.  Less than a month after the force was rocked by the
resignation of two of its most senior officers over the phone-
hacking scandal at News Corp.’s now defunct News of the World
newspaper, the Met said the night of Aug. 8 was “the worst” it
had seen “in current memory” as shops were looted and set on
fire, sometimes while officers looked on.  “There’s a fear of being seen to over-react,” said Peter Power, a former superintendent in the Met who policed riots in
Brixton in south London in 1981 and is now in the government’s
Crisis Management Steering Group. “A series of controversial
reports have left the police feeling demoralized and
emasculated. They don’t know whether they’re a force or a
service. What we need now is a force.”  Police attempted to regain the initiative yesterday by
deploying 16,000 officers overnight in London to deter a fourth
night of rioting, up from 6,000 the previous evening. Having
already employed armored vehicles, the forces’ commanders said
they wouldn’t rule out the use of rubber bullets.  Hackney Incident  In one incident on the night of Aug. 8, television pictures
showed rioters in Hackney in northeast London stealing wooden
planks from the back of a truck and then smashing the windows of
a bus, yards from a line of police in riot gear. The bus moved
off only when a passer-by stopped to pick up the trashcan
blocking its way.  The force has frequently been the brunt of politicians’
criticism in recent years. Its last two commissioners, Ian Blair
and Paul Stephenson, have both been forced to resign, Stephenson
over the phone-hacking fallout and Blair following a clash over
policies with London Mayor  Boris Johnson .  The judgment of officers was called into question when a
homeless newspaper seller died after finding himself passing
through police lines during 2009 demonstrations, and again when
a Brazilian electrician was mistaken for a suicide bomber and
shot dead in 2005. In 1999, an inquiry into the mishandling of
the 1993 murder of a black teenager found the police were
“institutionally racist.” This week’s riots were sparked by
the police shooting of a black man, Mark Duggan, as they were
attempting to make an arrest.  Parliament Recalled  Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday recalled Parliament
to address the country’s worst rioting since the 1980s. While
more than 500 people have been arrested, shopkeepers and
residents of areas subject to looting said the police response
was ineffective.  “The police weren’t doing enough, they were just
watching,” said Abdul Sadek, 37, manager of health-food store
Holland & Barrett in Hackney. Closed-circuit television pictures
from his shop showed youths kicking the door in and looting the
store. “It was like a standoff.”  Down the road the O2 phone shop had its shutters bashed in.
Staff had fled in the early afternoon. “You can’t blame the
police but they’ve lost control,” said Harris Zafar, 24, the
manager. “It’s like a war zone.”  Serkan Kaya, who works at the nearby Ali Baba burger bar,
said at one point in the evening he’d seen rioters fleeing from
a group of locals. “A group ran past being chased by people
from around here,” he said. “People started fighting back
because police couldn’t do anything so they were protecting
their shops themselves.”  ‘Pretty Good Job’  Stephen Timms, a Labour Party lawmaker who represents an
east London district that saw some rioting, defended officers in
his area.  “My impression is that the police did a pretty good job of
containing things yesterday,” he said. “Things were moving so
fast, and flaring up in different places.”  Cameron, who returned early from his vacation in  Italy  on
Aug. 8, signaled he wanted the police to take a tougher line.
“It’s quite clear we need more, much more, police on our
streets, and we need even more robust police action,” he told
reporters outside his Downing Street office yesterday.  Power questioned whether the prime minister would back
officers who took him at his word. “Does he know what that
means?” he said. “That means people looting and rioting will
end up in hospital. Is he prepared to defend police in those
circumstances?”  To contact the reporters on this story:
