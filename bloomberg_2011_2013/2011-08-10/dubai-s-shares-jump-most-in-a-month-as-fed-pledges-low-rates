Dubai’s benchmark stock index rose
the most in almost a month as the  Federal Reserve  pledged to
keep  interest rates  at a record low through mid-2013 and said it
may use other tools to bolster the U.S. economy. Oil climbed.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
tower in Dubai, advanced 1.5 percent.  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) 
climbed the most this month. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  gained 1.2
percent, the most since July 13, to 1,460.96 at the 2 p.m. close
in Dubai. The measure has dropped 3.7 percent this month. The
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  increased 0.8 percent and the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index rose 1.8 percent at 4:52 p.m. in Dubai.  “ Ben Bernanke ’s statement gave markets a little
confidence, at least in the short term,” said Paul Cooper,
Dubai-based managing director at Sarasin-Alpen & Partners Ltd.
which oversees more than $500 million in the Middle East. “The
United Arab Emirates and Gulf Cooperation Council markets have
performed better than other markets, so the response here is
more muted than elsewhere.”  Bernanke made the comments after global markets tumbled in
the wake of  Standard & Poor’s  unprecedented cut of the U.S.’s
credit rating on Aug. 5. Excluding today, Dubai’s index slumped
6.3 percent this week. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index tumbled 7
percent Aug. 8 and 9. In  New York  yesterday, the S&P 500 Index
rallied 4.7 percent, the biggest advance since March 2009.  The Federal Open Market Committee is “prepared to employ”
additional tools to bolster an economy hobbled by weak hiring
and anemic household spending, it said in a statement.  Oil’s Advance  Oil for September delivery gained as much as 4.5 percent to
$82.90 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before
trading at $81.70. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, including the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, supply about a
fifth of the world’s oil.  Emaar rose the most since Aug. 4 to 2.79 dirhams. Dubai
Islamic, the U.A.E.’s biggest lender complying with Shariah
rules, climbed 2.1 percent, the most since July 31, to 1.99
dirhams.  Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA)  surged 4.3 percent, the most
since Feb. 24, to 1.22 dirhams. The state-run utility said
second-quarter profit more than doubled to 435 million dirhams
($118 million) on higher oil and gas sales.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  rose 1 percent. Qatar’s  QE
Index (DSM)  climbed 0.7 percent. Kuwait’s gauge increased 0.3 percent
and Bahrain’s BB All Share Index gained 0.6 percent. Saudi
Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  climbed 0.5 percent. Oman’s MSM
30 Index decreased 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
