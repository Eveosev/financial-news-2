Taiwan’s dollar gained the most in
seven days and bonds snapped two days of losses after the
 Federal Reserve  pledged to keep record-low  interest rates  to
help support the economy.  The currency halted a slide that sent it to the weakest in
three months yesterday after the U.S. central bank vowed to
retain the target rate at zero to 0.25 percent at least through
mid-2013, saying growth in the world’s largest economy was
“considerably slower” than anticipated.  “The market prefers to sell the  U.S. dollar  because this
is like QE3” in effect, said Keith Chen, a currency trader at
Fubon Commercial Bank in Taipei, referring to the Fed’s
quantitative easing policy.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.010
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. It earlier rose as much as 0.4 percent to
NT$28.935.  The Fed completed a second round of quantitative easing in
June in which it bought $600 billion of bonds to lower borrowing
costs. The  Federal Open Market Committee  is “prepared to
employ” additional tools to bolster the economy, it said in a
statement in Washington yesterday.  The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2016 dropped 2.2
basis points, or 0.022 percentage point, to 1.085 percent,
prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.387 percent,
according to the weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
