China ’s  interest-rate  swaps rose for
the first time in seven days after the  Federal Reserve  pledged
to maintain a near-zero interest rate for two more years to
bolster a recovery in the world’s largest economy.  The Fed’s statement helped shore up demand for stocks and
emerging-market assets, with the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of
shares snapping a six-day decline. China’s seven-day repurchase
rate, a measure of interbank funding availability, has dropped
1.99 percentage points this month to 3.11 percent, according to
the National Interbank Funding Center.  “Now that risk sentiment has stabilized, traders are
covering some of the previous received positions while still
giving due respect to the fact that the repo fixing has
recovered to normal levels,” said Pin Ru Tan, a strategist at
HSBC Securities Asia Ltd. in  Hong Kong .  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, gained four
basis points to 3.715 percent as of 4:49 p.m. in Shanghai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It declined 52 basis
points, or 0.52 percentage point, in the six days through
yesterday.  Consumer prices climbed 6.5 percent from a year earlier in
July, from 6.4 percent the previous month, the statistics bureau
said yesterday. That was the fastest pace in three years.  The yield on the 3.44 percent government bonds due June
2016 was little changed at 3.82 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  --Judy Chen, Fion Li. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
