Gold futures extended a rally to a
record, topping $1,800 an ounce, on mounting demand for a haven
as global equities plunged amid escalating U.S. and European
debt woes.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of shares approached the lowest level
since September as U.S. stocks tumbled. The euro dropped as much
as 1.5 percent against the dollar, and the yen strengthened
close to a post-World War II high against the greenback. This
week, gold has jumped 8 percent, the biggest three-day rally
since November 2008.  “The race to debase currencies is on,” James Dailey, who
manages $185 million at TEAM Financial Management LLC, said in a
telephone interview from Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania . “Gold will
continue to appreciate until there is a fundamental shift in
government policies.”  Gold futures for December delivery climbed $41.30, or 2.4
percent, to settle at $1,784.30 at 2:13 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Earlier, the price reached a record $1,801, climbing to an
all-time high for the third straight day.  This week, the metal has gained $132.50 after  Standard &
Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit rating by one level from the top AAA
grade on Aug. 5. The S&P announcement, combined with  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis, spurred a rout in global equities and
stoked concern that the U.S. may lapse into another recession.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a report dated yesterday,
raised its 12-month gold-price forecast to $2,000 on the
increased chance for another round of U.S. asset purchases,
known as quantitative easing.  ‘Far From Over’  “The overall problems in the U.S. are far from over, and
the appetite for haven assets like gold is very strong,” said
Viral Shah, a vice president at Geojit Comtrade Ltd. in Mumbai.
Investors “want to opt out from the other asset classes, and
that is always going to be to the benefit of gold,” he said.  Silver futures for September delivery rose $1.444, or 3.8
percent, to $39.327 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for October delivery advanced $15.30, or
0.9 percent, to $1,771.70 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The metal, used mostly in catalytic converters in
cars, closed below gold for the first time since December 2008.  Palladium futures for September delivery fell $7.75, or 1.1
percent, to $726.80 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters for this story:
