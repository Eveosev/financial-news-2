Senegal  will build an international
airport, a power plant, and 500 kilometers (311 miles) of roads
in the southern province of Casamance,  le Soleil  reported,
citing Karim Wade, minister for air transportation, electricity,
infrastructure and international cooperation.  The West African nation may build as many as 14 regional
airports, the Dakar-based newspaper cited Wade as saying. The
government is also renewing a project to build roads that would
circumvent Gambia, the countryâ€™s southern neighbor, according to
Soleil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
