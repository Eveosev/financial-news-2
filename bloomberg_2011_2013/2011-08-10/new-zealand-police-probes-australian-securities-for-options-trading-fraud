New Zealand ’s  Serious Fraud Office 
has begun an investigation of Australian Securities (NZ) Ltd.
following allegations that investors may have been defrauded.  Australian Securities (NZ), based in Auckland, specializes
in trading derivatives and options on the futures market of the
Australian Stock Exchange, the Serious Fraud Office said in an
e-mailed news release.  “There are reasonable grounds to believe an offense
involving serious or complex fraud may have been committed,”
SFO Chief Executive Adam Feeley said in the news release. “We
believe it is in the public interest for current and future
investors to be aware of SFO’s inquiries.”  Investigators may hire outside experts to help with the
probe, Feeley said.  The amount of money involved in the fraud isn’t being
disclosed, Sharon van Gulik, a SFO spokeswoman, said in a phone
interview.  Officials from Australian Securities (NZ) couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment. Australian Securities Ltd.,
based in  Melbourne , doesn’t have a New Zealand office and isn’t
involved in the probe, Nigel Gohl, a senior finance manager,
said on the phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
