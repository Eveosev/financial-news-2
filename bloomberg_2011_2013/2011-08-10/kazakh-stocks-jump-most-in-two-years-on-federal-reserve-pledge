Kazakh stocks soared the most in two
years after the U.S. Federal Reserve pledged to keep  interest
rates  near zero through mid-2013.  Kazakhstan’s KASE index increased 7 percent to 1,290.07 at
3:31 p.m. in Astana, the biggest surge on a closing basis since
April 2009.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) , the country’s biggest copper
producer, led gains on the index, advancing 12 percent. AO Halyk
Savings Bank, controlled by President Nursultan Nazarbayev ’s
daughter and son-in-law, rallied 11 percent.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index snapped a six-day losing
streak and the MSCI World Index of developed-nation shares
climbed 1.1 percent after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  vowed
yesterday to keep borrowing costs at an all-time low to revive a
recovery that is “considerably slower” than expected.  Bernanke’s comments are “bringing back quite a bit of risk
appetite,” lifting stocks across emerging markets,  Lars Christensen , chief emerging-markets analyst at Danske Bank A/S
in Copenhagen, said in a phone interview today. The markets may
experience a “moderate gain” over the next few days,
Christensen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
