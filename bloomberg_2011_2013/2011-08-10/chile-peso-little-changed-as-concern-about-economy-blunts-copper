Chile ’s peso fell for a fifth day,
its longest losing streak since January, as copper slid and U.S.
stocks tumbled, diminishing demand for riskier emerging market
assets.  The peso declined 0.1 percent to 473.52 pesos per U.S.
dollar at 1:48 p.m. New York time, from 472.97 yesterday.  “Our currency has been showing a strong correlation with
the Dow and the  S&P 500 ,” Andres de la Cerda, a trader at Bice
Inversiones, said in a telephone interview from Santiago.  U.S. stocks fell, following the biggest gain since 2009 for
benchmark indexes, amid concern that Europe will fail to contain
its sovereign-debt crisis and that the U.S. economic recovery is
faltering. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 2.2 percent
to 1,146.52. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 2.6 percent
to 10,953.42.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, dropped
1.5 percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , weakening the
country’s terms of trade. The metal has fallen for six of the
past seven sessions.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 4.90 percent. It has fallen for the last
ten sessions in a row, its longest losing streak since December
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
