Oil surged the most in three months
in New York after U.S. crude supplies declined the most in a
year and demand increased.  Futures rose as inventories fell to a five-month low and
demand reached the highest level this year. Oil also gained on
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will take more action to
bolster the economy after the Fed said it would keep  interest
rates  near zero until mid-2013. The dollar slipped to a one-week
low against the euro yesterday after the announcement.  “The DOE numbers are great, and lower prices are only
going to encourage demand over the next few weeks," said  Hamza Khan , an analyst with the Schork Group Inc., a consulting
company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . "Given what the Fed said
after its meeting, things are going to be bearish for the
dollar, so should be bullish for crude oil.”  Crude for September delivery climbed $3.59, or 4.5 percent,
to settle at $82.89 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange
in the biggest one-day gain since May 9. Yesterday, the contract
settled at $79.30, the lowest level since Sept. 29. Prices are
down 9.3 percent this year.  Brent oil for September settlement gained $4.11, or 4
percent, to $106.68 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract’s premium of
$23.79 to U.S. futures is a record high.  Supplies Tumble  U.S. stockpiles fell 5.23 million barrels, or 1.5 percent,
to 349.8 million barrels last week, the biggest drop since Dec.
17. Inventories were expected to rise 1.35 million barrels,
according to the median estimate of 12 analysts and traders in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Total products supplied, a measure of demand, surged
652,000 barrels a day, or 3.3 percent, to 20.3 million, the
highest level since Dec. 24, according to the Energy Department.  “Those are bullish numbers, and a big drop like that
should be treated bullishly by the market,” said Sean Brodrick,
a natural resource analyst with  Weiss Research  in Jupiter,
 Florida .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 56.4 percent at 3 p.m. in New York
up from 31.7 percent a week ago. New York futures have tumbled
from a two-year high of $114.83 a barrel on May 2.  ’Going Lower’  “The DOE numbers were bullish, but the commodity itself is
going lower, and the trend is lower,” said Todd Horwitz, chief
strategist at Adam Mesh Trading Group in New York. “I certainly
don’t think it’s going to get past $85 now. $85 is probably the
new top.”  Crude traded as low as $79.53 after the  International
Energy Agency  said demand may slow and equities fell.  The IEA said threats to global economic recovery may cut
oil demand growth next year by more than 60 percent, while
keeping underlying forecasts for 2011 and 2012 little changed.  The Paris-based agency, which advises 28 industrialized
nations on  energy policy , trimmed demand forecasts for 2011 by
60,000 barrels a day as fuel costs weigh on consumers, and
raised projections for next year by 70,000 a day to 91.1 million
on growth in  Japan .  The IEA expects global oil consumption will increase 1.6
million barrels a day, or 1.8 percent, in 2012. It may expand by
less than half that amount if worldwide growth misses
expectations, it said.  Equities, Dollar  Oil increased as equities pared intraday losses of more
than 4 percent before declining further after the trading floor
closed. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 4.4 percent to
1,120.76 in New York, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell
4.6 percent to 10,719.94.  The dollar fell to the lowest level this month after the
Fed announcement yesterday, dropping 1.4 percent to $1.4376 per
euro and boosting commodities as an alternative investment. The
currency gained 1.3 percent at 4:55 p.m. in New York to $1.4178
per euro.  Brent crude oil may fall to $80 a barrel in a “mild”
recession, a price that would prompt the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce supply, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said in a report dated yesterday.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 881,188
contracts as of 4:17 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 1.08
million contracts yesterday, 57 percent above the average of the
past three months and the highest level since April 12. Open
interest was 1.56 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
