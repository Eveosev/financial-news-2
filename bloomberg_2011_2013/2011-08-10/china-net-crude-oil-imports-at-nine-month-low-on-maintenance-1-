China’s net imports of crude oil in
July fell to the lowest in nine months as refinery maintenance
reduced demand in the world’s biggest energy user.  Net imports declined 1 percent from June to 19.23 million
metric tons, or 4.55 million barrels a day, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on data released today by the
Beijing-based General Administration of Customs.  Imports  were
19.43 million tons and exports at 200,000 tons, the data show.  China will shut seven major refineries, with a combined
capacity of 707,800 barrels a day, in the third quarter,
according to Gong Manying, a market research director at
PetroChina Co., the nation’s second-largest oil refiner.  The nation processed 8.86 million barrels a day of crude
last month compared with output exceeding 9 million in May,
before maintenance season started, according to data yesterday
from the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing.  The Asian nation bought crude at an average price of $110 a
barrel in July, similar to levels in June and higher than the
$74 paid a year earlier, according to calculations based on
customs data.  Net imports of fuel, including gasoline and diesel, fell to
800,000 tons last month from 1.36 million tons in June,
according to the data. Net purchases reached a 29-month high of
2.07 million tons in December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
