Centrotherm Photovoltaics AG (CTN)  is
“currently negotiating” to sell a thin-film solar  production
line  worth 120 million euros ($173 million) to a Chinese
manufacturer, said Thomas Riegler, the company’s chief financial
officer.  The Chinese company already has signed a contract to buy
the line and is still discussing terms of the financing, Riegler
said in a telephone interview from Centrotherm’s headquarters at
Blaubeuren, Germany.  “We hope to be able to announce closure soon,” Riegler
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
