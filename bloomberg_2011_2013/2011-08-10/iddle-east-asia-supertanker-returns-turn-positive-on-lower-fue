Rental income for supertankers
hauling Middle East crude oil to  Asia , the world’s busiest trade
route for the vessels, turned positive on cheaper fuel costs.  Daily rents for very large crude carriers, each hauling 2
million barrels on the benchmark route to  Japan  from  Saudi
Arabia , was $3, the first positive reading since July 29,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. Crude oil fell
8.7 percent the past two days.  “With oil and therefore bunker fuel falling over the
last few days, it has helped owners nudge into the tiniest of
positive returns,” Ben Goggin, a freight-derivatives broker at
SSY Futures Ltd. in London, said by e-mail.  The price of global ship fuel, or bunkers, has fallen 1.2
percent since the end of the second quarter to $636.69 a metric
ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 25 ports
worldwide.  Charter costs as measured in industry-standard Worldscale
terms were 45.91 from 45.90 yesterday, according to the
exchange. Worldscale points are a percentage of a nominal rate,
or flat rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates
for every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a ton, are revised
annually by the Worldscale Association in  London  to reflect
changing fuel costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a measure of crude transport
costs that includes vessels smaller than supertankers, fell 0.6
percent to 705 points, according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
