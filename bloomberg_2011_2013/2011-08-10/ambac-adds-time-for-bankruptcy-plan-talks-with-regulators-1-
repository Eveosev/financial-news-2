Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ) , the
bankrupt holding company for a failed bond insurer, won more
time to file its bankruptcy plan as it talks with regulators and
tax authorities, and will now file a revised plan by Aug. 25.  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  Judge Shelley Chapman in  New York 
today approved an extension of Ambac’s time to control its
reorganization. The company plans for a Sept. 8 hearing on its
plan, a creditors’ vote in October and final court approval Nov.
8,  Todd L. Padnos , a lawyer for the company, told Chapman.  “The fact remains that there are unresolved
contingencies,” Padnos said.  Ambac might exchange its debt for stock in a new company or
“deconsolidate” by breaking away from its operating unit,
depending on whether a settlement is reached, according to a
version of a plan filed July 6.  That plan didn’t have backing of the Office of the
Commissioner of Insurance, the Wisconsin regulator overseeing
the wind-down of the company’s failed bond insurer, Ambac
Assurance Corp.  Since Ambac Financial filed for Chapter 11 protection in
November, it has clashed with constituents, including its
operating unit, over who gets $7.3 billion in net operating
losses to use for tax benefits. The  Internal Revenue Service  has
challenged tax claims by both companies.  The holding company case is In re  Ambac Financial Group
Inc. (ABK) , 10-15973, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
