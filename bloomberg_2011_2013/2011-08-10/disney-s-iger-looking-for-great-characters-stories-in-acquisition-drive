  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , the world’s
largest theme-park company, is seeking acquisitions, a year and
a half after completing its $4.2 billion takeover of Marvel
Entertainment’s cast of film and comic-book characters.  “We don’t have what I’d call a strategic hole,” Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Iger  said yesterday on a conference
call after the company’s third-quarter earnings release. “But
we’ve looked expansively at opportunities across the world to
buy either new characters or businesses that are capable of
creating great characters and great stories.”  Iger didn’t specify any targets. He cited international as
an area of interest, and  India  as “another example of a high-
growth market. We think investing in it, at least in today’s
world, is a smart move,” Iger said.  Disney is in the middle of a regulatory review of its
proposal to buy the 49.6 percent of  UTV Software Communications
Ltd. (UTV) , a Mumbai-based film and TV production company, that it
doesn’t own for as much as 20.1 billion rupees ($445 million).  From fiscal 2006 to 2010, Burbank, California-based Disney
has spent $13 billion on acquisitions, Iger said. The company
now puts a $23 billion enterprise value on those purchases, he
said.  “He’s been smart about buying assets that contribute to
the core of the company,” said Bill Smead, chief investment
officer of Seattle-based Smead Capital Investment, which owns
57,813 shares of Disney. “He hasn’t overpaid, and he has
created value.”  Pixar Purchase  Disney acquired Pixar Animation for $8.06 billion in stock
in 2006, a deal announced three months after Iger assumed the
CEO’s job. The company completed the Marvel acquisition in
January 2010 and acquired the Internet casual game company
Playdom in August 2010 for $563 million in cash.  Iger spoke after Disney posted third-quarter sales and
profit that beat analysts’ estimates as pay-TV fees to the ESPN
sports network countered flat cable advertising sales.  Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion, or 77 cents a
share, from $1.33 billion, or 67 cents, a year ago, Disney said
yesterday in a statement. Profit excluding some items was 78
cents, beating the 73-cent average of 22 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Cable-network earnings rose 10 percent, with ESPN enjoying
gains in fees from pay-TV systems. Theme-park profit advanced
8.8 percent, fueled by higher admission prices at U.S. resorts
and this year’s later Easter break. The consumer products unit
boosted profit with sales of “Cars” and Marvel merchandise.  Sales in the period ended July 2 gained 6.7 percent to
$10.7 billion, exceeding analysts’ projections of $10.5 billion.  Disney fell 5 cents to $34.65 at 7:34 a.m. before the open
of the New York Stock Exchange, after gaining 5.1 percent to
$34.70 yesterday. The shares had declined 7.5 percent this year
before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
