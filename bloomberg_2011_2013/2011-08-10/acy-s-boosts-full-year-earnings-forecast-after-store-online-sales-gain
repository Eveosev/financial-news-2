Macy’s Inc. (M) , the second-biggest U.S.
department-store chain, reported quarterly earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates and boosted its full-year profit forecast as
sales increased faster than the retailer expected.  Full-year adjusted earnings per share will be as much as
$2.65, up from a previous forecast of a maximum of $2.45, the
Cincinnati-based company said today in a statement. Analysts had
projected $2.60, the average of 13 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Macy’s last week said quarterly same-store sales exceeded
its projections as store and online revenue gained at both its
namesake and Bloomingdales chains. The company sells exclusive
goods by Madonna and  Martha Stewart , and will offer  Karl
Lagerfeld  designs this month.  “Sales throughout the quarter were consistently good,”
 Matt Arnold , an analyst with Edward Jones & Co., said in an
interview today. “With the guidance, management is showing
confidence that they can sustain the sales momentum. To date,
there has been consumer spending power when it counts.”  Arnold, who is based in  Des Peres , Missouri, recommends
holding the shares.  Macy’s rose 10 cents to $25.54 at 9:51 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange Composite trading. The shares had gained less
than 1 percent this year before today.  Net income rose 64 percent to $241 million, or 55 cents a
share, in the three months ended July 30 from $147 million, or
35 cents, a year earlier. Analysts predicted 50 cents, the
average of 12 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 7.3
percent to $5.94 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
