Gasoline futures advanced after the
Energy Department reported that inventories fell for the first
time in four weeks.  Futures rose after the department said stockpiles fell 1.59
million barrels to 213.6 million. Crude supplies fell a second
straight week and distillate inventories dropped for the first
time since July 1. Gains came as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
sank 2.9 percent at 12:14 p.m. in  New York .  “It’s a sign of hope that oil and product prices are up
while the stock market is down,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “Inventory
declines across the board show that, maybe, the economy isn’t
dead on arrival.”  Gasoline for September delivery rose 5.74 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $2.725 a gallon at 12:14 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures settled yesterday at the lowest
level since Feb. 22.  Futures gained as output at Valero Energy Corp.’s Memphis
refinery has been halted since Aug. 5 and ConocoPhillips’s Ponca
City,  Oklahoma , refinery has been shut since Aug. 8. The plants
account for about 400,000 barrels of daily processing capacity.  Demand, as measured by deliveries to wholesalers, over the
past four weeks was down 3.4 percent from a year earlier,
according to department data.  Supplies of heating oil and diesel fell 737,000 barrels to
151.5 million barrels, the lowest in three week. Demand for
industrial, trucking and home-heating fuels over the past four
weeks was 7.1 percent above a year earlier.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1.5
cents to $3.637 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  Heating oil for September delivery rose 6.4 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $2.8288 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
