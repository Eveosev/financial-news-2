Western Canada Select’s discount and
Syncrude’s premium to benchmark West Texas Intermediate weakened
a day after  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  said its Keystone pipeline resumed
planned flow rates following maintenance.  The Keystone oil line, which runs from  Alberta  to  Oklahoma ,
is operating at 400,000 to 450,000 barrels a day, Terry Cunha, a
Calgary-based spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday. The
591,000-barrel-a-day line was shut Aug. 2 and began restarting
Aug. 8, he said.  The premium for Syncrude lost 60 cents to $13.90 a barrel,
at noon in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 25 cents to
$13.50 a barrel.  In the Gulf, Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 65
cents to $23.65 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 65 cents
to $24.65 a barrel over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend gained 70 cents to $20.50 while Poseidon’s premium
increased 60 cents to $20.35 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium added $1 to $19.25 a barrel
over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 90
cents. Thunder Horse’s premium gained $1.25 to $24.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
