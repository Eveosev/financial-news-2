Chamath Palihapitiya, an original
member of Facebook Inc.’s management team who left the company
in June, has joined the ownership group of the National
Basketball Association’s  Golden State Warriors .  Financial terms were not disclosed by the Oakland,
California-based team, which announced Palihapitiya’s investment
yesterday in a news release.  In four years at Facebook, the 34-year-old Palihapitiya
worked in various roles, including vice president of user
growth, mobile and international. He finished 101st in the main
event of this year’s  World Series  of Poker, earning $54,851,
more than five times his original stake.  The Warriors were sold in July 2010 for a league-record
$450 million by Christopher Cohan to a group led by Joe Lacob,
managing partner at the San Francisco Bay Area-based venture
capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Peter Guber,
chairman of Mandalay Entertainment Group.  Among the other bidders for the club was  Larry Ellison , the
billionaire chief executive of  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)   The Warriors have made the postseason once since 1994.
Golden State was 12th among the Western Conference’s 15 teams
last season with a 36-46 record.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
