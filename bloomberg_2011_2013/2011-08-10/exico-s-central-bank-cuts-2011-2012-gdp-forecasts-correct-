(Corrects time frame in seventh paragraph.)  Mexico’s central bank lowered its
forecast for economic growth this year and next while keeping
its consumer price forecasts unchanged, according to its
quarterly inflation report published today.  Banco de Mexico  cut its 2011 economic growth forecast to a
range of 3.8 percent to 4.8 percent and its 2012 forecast to 3.5
percent to 4.5 percent. The bank in its May report had seen 2011
growth of 4 percent to 5 percent and 2012 growth of 3.8 percent
to 4.8 percent. The central bank kept its 2011 and 2012 consumer
price forecasts at 3 percent to 4 percent.  “The balance of risks for growth in the Mexican economy
has deteriorated,” the bank said in the report. The risks for
inflation “have moderately improved,” the report said.  Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB
have reduced their Mexican economic growth forecasts on signs of
economic weakness in the U.S., which buys about 80 percent of
 Mexico ’s exports.  Mexico’s economy will grow 4.2 percent in 2011, according
to the median estimate of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s economy will feel the effects of the “debt
problems” in the U.S. and  Europe  and so the risks of lower
economic growth in Mexico are now greater, bank Governor Agustin Carstens said at the at the central bank in Mexico City today.
Global economic growth has leveled out, he said.  ‘Mexico Stands Out’  The “difficulty of creating a sustainable debt situation
in European countries has elevated market uncertainty,”
Carstens said. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to keep
 interest rates  at an all-time low through mid-20132 to revive a
recovery is “very important.”  In a report e-mailed to investors today, JPMorgan said
 Latin America ’s second-biggest economy will expand 4.2 percent
in 2011, down from an earlier forecast of 4.5 percent, and 3.2
percent in 2012 from a previous forecast of 3.8 percent.  Credit Suisse Group AG today reduced its 2011 growth
forecast for Mexico to 3.9 percent from 4.2 percent,     and its
2012 forecast to 3.2 percent from 3.5 percent, according to a
research note e-mailed to investors.  Rate Outlook  The central bank will increase the nation’s benchmark
lending rate from a record low of 4.5 percent in September 2012,
according to yields on futures contracts for the 28-day TIIE
interbank rate.  With inflation pressures rising in nations such as Brazil
and  China , “Mexico stands out because inflation has been
relatively well behaved here,” Carstens said.  Lower prices for grains on international markets should
help keep inflation in Mexico in check, he said.  Policy makers at their last meeting on July 8 kept the rate
unchanged for a 20th straight meeting, Carstens said, because of
the favorable evolution of the  exchange rate , a slower narrowing
of the output gap, the limited impact of commodity prices on
inflation and inflation expectations and also because inflation
expectations are well-anchored.  Annual inflation quickened to 3.55 percent in July, the
national statistics agency reported yesterday. Inflation will
accelerate to 3.6 percent by year-end, according to the median
forecast in a survey by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit.  Mexican gross domestic product expanded 5.4 percent last
year, the most in 10 years.  Mexico’s peso has lost 5.1 this month and the benchmark IPC
stock index has dropped 10 percent over the same period
following Standard and Poor’s downgrade off the U.S.’s top
credit rating and volatility in global markets.  The peso fell 2.6 percent to 12.3563 per dollar at 3:12
p.m. New York time from 12.0391 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
