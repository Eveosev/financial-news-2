Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , the
world’s largest custody bank, plans to cut 1,500 jobs, or 3
percent of the workforce, to curb expense growth.  “Expenses have been growing unsustainably faster” than
revenue, Robert P. Kelly, BNY Mellon’s chief executive officer,
said today in a statement from  New York . “We expect our natural
turnover and immediate hiring freeze will reduce the impact on
existing staff” from the job reductions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
