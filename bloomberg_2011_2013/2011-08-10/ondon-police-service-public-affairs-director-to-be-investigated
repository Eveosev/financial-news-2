The U.K.’s Independent Police
Complaints Commission has begun an investigation into the
conduct of Dick Fedorcio, the director of public affairs for the
London Metropolitan Police Service, London police said in an e-
mailed statement.  The investigation will examine “whether Mr. Fedorcio has
committed any act of gross misconduct,” the statement said.
Fedorcio will be permitted to work from home on a period of
extended leave until the matter is resolved, the statement said.  The investigation follows “a conduct referral on Tuesday,
19 July, 2011,” the statement said. While Fedorcio is away, the
directorate will be overseen by the commissioner’s chief of
staff, Caroline Murdoch, the statement said.  The Metropolitan Police said on July 19 that the IPCC was
examining the relationship between Fedorcio and News
International,  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s U.K. publishing unit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
