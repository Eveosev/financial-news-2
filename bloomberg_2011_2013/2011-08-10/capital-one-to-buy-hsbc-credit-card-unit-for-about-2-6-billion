(Corrects headline and first paragraph on value of sale.)  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
lender that acquired ING Direct USA in June, agreed to purchase
HSBC Holdings Plc’s U.S. credit card business for a premium of
about $2.6 billion.  The transaction places an 8.75 percent premium on
receivables from HSBC’s $30 billion of credit-card loans,
Capital One said in a statement today. The deal allows McLean,
Virginia-based Capital One to expand its balance sheet that held
about $124 billion in loans at the end of June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
