OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest
lender, is seeking tax breaks for the Dulisma oil field in East
Siberia that obtained in 2009 after  Urals Energy Plc (UEN)  failed to
repay a $650 million loan to the bank,  Kommersant  reported.  Russia annulled tax breaks for East Siberian oil projects
from Aug. 1, while Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German Gref 
asked  Dmitry Medvedev  to consider keeping tax breaks for
Dulisma, the newspaper said, citing a copy of Gref’s letter to
the President.  Sberbank seeks to sell the non-core asset to billionaire
Vladimir Yevtushenkov’s OAO Bashneft, while current tax levels
make the development of Dulisma unprofitable, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
