Daily exports of North Sea Forties
crude in September will increase by 38 percent from this month
to a five-month high, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The shipping plan for next month comprises 24 cargoes
totaling 14.4 million barrels, or 480,000 barrels a day, the
most since April. This compares with 18 cargoes amounting to
348,387 barrels a day, the program showed.  Forties is one of four North Sea oil grades used to price
crude from the  Middle East , Africa and  Russia . The other blends
are Brent, Ekofisk and Oseberg.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
