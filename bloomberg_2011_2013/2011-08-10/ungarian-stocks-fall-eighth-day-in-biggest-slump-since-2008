Hungarian stocks tumbled for an
eighth day in the biggest sell-off since October 2008, as a
weaker forint sent OTP Bank Nyrt. lower and concern deepened
 Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen.  The BUX gauge of 13 companies sank 6.8 percent to 17,381.28
by close in Budapest, its lowest since Aug. 3, 2009. The index
dropped 29 percent from this year’s high in April. The forint
slid 0.5 percent to 266.05 per franc after falling to a record
272.62 earlier today.  Today’s decline capped a 20 percent slump over eight days
for  Hungary ’s benchmark equity index. European stocks dropped to
a two-year low today and U.S. shares declined as the  Federal
Reserve ’s plan to hold  interest rates  failed to ease concern
that the economic recovery is stalling.  OTP, Hungary’s largest lender, tumbled 12 percent to 3,931
forint, the lowest since July 2009. More than 5.6 million shares
changed hands, almost four times the average of the past three
months.  Borrowers have to use more local currency to repay franc
loans as the forint weakens. A doubling of bad loans denominated
in the franc could cut OTP’s profit by about 20 percent,  ING
Groep NV (INGA)  said yesterday.  Mol Nyrt., the country’s biggest refiner, retreated 6.7
percent to 15,770 forint, the lowest since December 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
