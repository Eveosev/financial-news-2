Henkel AG, the German maker of
Loctite glues and Persil detergent, said second-quarter profit
jumped 34 percent as demand rose in  Asia  and the  Middle East .  Net income rose to 366 million euros ($525 million) from
273 million euros a year earlier, Dusseldorf-based Henkel said
in a statement today. Profit beat the average 312.2 million-euro
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales increased
1.6 percent to 3.95 billion euros, compared with the average
estimate of 19 analysts of 4.01 billion euros.  Henkel is selling more industrial adhesives in emerging
markets in Asia, eastern  Europe  and the Middle East as
manufacturers expand. The company, founded in 1876, generates
almost half of its revenue from the products. Henkel today
raised its target for full-year sales growth at existing
operations to 5 percent, the top of an earlier forecast range.  “With intense competition continuing, an increase in raw-
material prices and growing uncertainties in the markets, the
economic environment will remain challenging,” Chief Executive
Officer Kasper Rorsted said in the statement. “Against this
background, we will further adapt our structures in order to
respond more quickly and flexibly to changes in our markets and
maintain strict cost control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
