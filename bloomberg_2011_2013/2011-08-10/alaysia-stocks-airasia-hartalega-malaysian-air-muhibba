 Kuala Lumpur .  The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBMKLCI)  Index rose 8.38, or 0.6
percent, to 1,480.52, snapping a three-day slump.  Malaysian Airline System Bhd. (MAS)   jumped 7.5 percent
to 1.72 ringgit, the steepest gain since May 26, 2010. Its
parent Khazanah Nasional Bhd. agreed to swap a 20.5 percent
stake in the company for a 10 percent holding in budget airline
 AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA)  , forging ties between the nation’s two
biggest carriers. AirAsia fell 10.4 percent to 3.54 ringgit, the
most since Dec. 1, 2008. Its rating was cut to “sell” from
“buy” at UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd., which said in a report
the tie-up was unlikely to benefit the low-cost carrier.        Al-Hadharah Boustead REIT (BIRT)  , an Islamic oil-palm
plantation trust, rose 2.8 percent to 1.46 ringgit, its largest
gain since Feb. 28, after second-quarter profit rose 50 percent
to 23.9 million ringgit ($7.9 million).        Hartalega Holdings Bhd. (HART)  , a producer of synthetic
and latex gloves, gained 2.2 percent to 5.51 ringgit, its

first quarter ended June 30 rose 32 percent to 54.8 million
ringgit, it said in a company statement.        MBf Holdings Bhd. (MBFH)  , a credit card, property and
auto group, added 5.7 percent to 56 sen, the most since March
18. MBf said second-quarter profit surged to 79.7 million
ringgit from 6.9 million ringgit a year earlier, bolstered by
one-time gains from a fair-value adjustment for its investment
properties.       Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd. (MUHI MK) climbed 4.3 percent
to 1.22 ringgit. The builder was informed that Asia Petroleum
Hub Bhd. had reached an agreement with CIMB Bank Bhd. to remove
it from receivership, according to an exchange filing. Muhibbah
is a contractor on its petroleum hub project.        TDM Bhd. (TDM)  , a palm oil producer, advanced 2.8
