 Tools, quad bikes and fuel were the
top three things stolen from farms in the U.K. last year,
according to a report from the National Farmers Union.  Thieves took about 49.7 million pounds ($80.3 million)
worth of goods from farms in 2010, the NFU said today, citing
data from insurer NFU Mutual. Oil and diesel were the third-most
stolen item on the list ahead of tractors, scrap metal,
machinery, trailers, vehicles, personal items and farm animals.  “Whether it’s the recession, tighter security in towns or
the rise in oil, meat and scrap metal prices countryside people
are feeling the blight of rural crime on their land,” NFU
Mutual Chief Executive Lindsay Sinclair said in the report.  Two-thirds of the insurance company’s branches reported an
increase in crime in their areas, according to the report. Most
said thieves target farms because they’re remote and difficult
to police, the NFU said. Power tools were attractive to thieves
and 59 percent of thefts were from barns or other buildings,
according to the report.  Copper prices in  London  have gained 18 percent in the past
year.  Oil prices  have been steady in the past year and are up 15
percent since August 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
