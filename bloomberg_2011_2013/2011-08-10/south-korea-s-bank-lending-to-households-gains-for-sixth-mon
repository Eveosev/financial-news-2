South Korea ’s bank lending to
households rose for a sixth straight month in July as people
took out more loans to buy houses.  Lending to households increased by 2.3 trillion won ($2.1
billion) last month to a record 445.5 trillion won, the Bank of
Korea said in an e-mailed statement today.  Rising household debt and inflation above the central
bank’s target since January have prompted policy makers to raise
borrowing costs three times this year. The central bank is
expected to hold off from raising  interest rates  tomorrow,
according to 10 of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
with the remaining five predicting an increase.  Mortgage lending rose 1.9 trillion won to 297.3 trillion
won, today’s report showed. Loans to companies advanced 5.9
trillion won to 545.7 trillion won.  The broadest measure of  money supply , M2, gained 3 percent
in June from a year earlier, according to a separate central
bank statement. The gauge rose 3.7 percent in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
