The Port of Rotterdam’s largest
coal-storage company said inventories rose as European utilities
restocked the fuel in anticipation of stronger winter demand.  Stockpiles at Europees Massagoed-Overslagbedrijf BV, or
Emo, increased to 3.1 million metric tons this week from 3
million tons last week, according to Sjaak Roukema, commercial
manager of the company. Inventories climbed along with demand,
Roukema said by phone today.  “ Germany  will import more coal in the second half as it
cuts the use of nuclear power,” Judy Zhu, an analyst with
Standard Chartered Plc, said today by phone. Germany, the
largest user of thermal coal in  Europe , will import 32.5 million
tons by sea this year, up 12 percent from a year earlier, Zhu
said in a report yesterday.  Germany aims to curb nuclear-power use after March’s
earthquake and tsunami caused radiation leaks at Japan’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, stoking safety concerns in Europe’s
largest economy.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said in June she would
replace Germany’s 17 reactors with renewable sources and fossil
fuel-based plants. The government seeks to exit nuclear
generation by 2022.  European coal rose $1, or 0.8 percent, to $126.25 a ton by
1:15 p.m. in  London , after declining for two days in a row.  To contact the reporter on this story:
