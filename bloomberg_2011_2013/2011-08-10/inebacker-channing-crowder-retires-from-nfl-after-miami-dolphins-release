Linebacker Channing Crowder
announced his retirement from the National Football League, less
than two weeks after being cut by the  Miami Dolphins .  Crowder,  speaking on WQAM Radio  in Miami, said he decided
to retire to focus on his family rather than try to catch on
with another team.  “I’m hanging it up,” said Crowder, 27. “I woke up, saw
my pregnant wife, and all the teams that talked to me way up
north, the Northeast, and I said I don’t want to do it.”  Crowder, who made 344 tackles in six seasons with the
Dolphins, tried out with the  New England Patriots  and said he
had some interest from the Buffalo Bills, Chicago Bears and
Philadelphia Eagles. He was cut by the Dolphins on July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
