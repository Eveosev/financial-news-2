Ghana ’s cedi strengthened the most
this week as the central bank sold dollars to meet demand from
investors outside the West African nation that wanted to drop
their cedi-denominated investments.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer,
appreciated 0.01 percent to 1.5336, by 3:41 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A close at
this level will be the highest since Aug. 8.  “The central bank sold dollars today,” said Chris Nettey,
a currency trader at the local unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd.,
in a phone interview. He declined to say how much was sold by
the Bank of Ghana. “There was a bit of dollar buying from
offshore investors, to exit their investments denominated in
cedis.”  The central bank lends “liquidity support” when it sees the
need for it, Collins Antwi, an assistant director at the
treasury department of the  Bank of Ghana , said by phone. He
declined to confirm whether the bank sold dollars today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
