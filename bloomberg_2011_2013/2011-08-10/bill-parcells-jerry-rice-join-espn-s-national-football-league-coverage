Bill Parcells  and Jerry Rice will
work as National Football League analysts for ESPN this season.  Parcells, a 19-year NFL head coach who last worked for the
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  network in 2007, will be a contributor on the
“Sunday NFL Countdown” program, ESPN said in a  news release .
Rice, the NFL’s all-time leader in pass receptions and receiving
yards, will appear on “NFL Live,” “SportsCenter” and
“Audibles.”  Parcells was 183-138-1 as an NFL coach for the New York
Giants, New England Patriots, New York Jets and Dallas Cowboys,
leading the Giants to Super Bowl titles during the 1986 and 1990
seasons.  He was also the Miami Dolphins’ executive vice president of
football operations from 2008 to 2010.  Rice, who played 16 seasons with the  San Francisco 49ers ,
was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010 after a
20-year career that ended in 2004. His 1,549 receptions and
22,895 receiving yards are both records, as are his 208 total
touchdowns and 23,546 combined net yards.  Last season Rice co-hosted the “Sports Sunday” prime-time
show on NBC affiliate KNTV in the San Francisco Bay area, and
well as a talk show on Sirius Satellite Radio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
