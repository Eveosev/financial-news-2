climbed 50 cents, or 1 percent, to 50 shillings, the biggest
gain since Aug. 2. The Nairobi-based bank said net income
increased to 834.9 million shillings ($8.9 million) in the six
months through June, from 677.9 million shillings a year
earlier.  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY)  ,  Nigeria ’s second-
biggest lender by market value, declined 33 kobo, or 2.8
percent, to 11.64 naira, on “low investor confidence,” after

meet a Sept. 30 recapitalization deadline, PAC Securities
Limited Chief Executive Officer Eugene Ezenwa said. “Investors
do not know what will happen next,” he said.  First Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN)  , the third-biggest
lender, lost 43 kobo, or 4.1 percent, to 10.15 naira, its lowest
close since April 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
