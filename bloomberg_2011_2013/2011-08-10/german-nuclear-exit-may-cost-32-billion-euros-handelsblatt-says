Germany â€™s speedier exit from nuclear
power will cost households and industry an additional 32 billion
euros ($46 billion) in higher electricity bills,  Handelsblatt 
reported, quoting a study commissioned by the  Economy Ministry .  The nuclear exit will also result in a transfer of
electricity generation outside Germany and an increase in fossil
fuel imports, the newspaper cited the study as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
