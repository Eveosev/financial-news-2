Ukrainian farmers reaped 32.8
million metric tons of grain as of yesterday, almost completing
harvesting of so-called early cereals, Agriculture Minister
Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  Reaping covered 10.8 million hectares (26.7 million acres),
or 96 percent of sown areas, Prysyazhnyuk said today in an e-
mailed statement.  “Rains are hampering completing the harvesting in some
regions,” he said. “But we are now concentrating machines
there, and as soon as the weather allows, the harvesting of
early grains will be completed.”  The average yield was 3.04 tons a hectare, “much better
than last year,” the minister said, without giving a
comparative figure for 2010. About 60 percent of wheat is
suitable for milling and 40 percent is of feed quality, the
statement showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
