Metinvest, Ukraine’s largest
steelmaker, attracted a $850 million loan to replace two
existing debts.  The loan will mature in five years and pay an interest
margin of 3 percent annually over Libor, Deutsche Bank AG said
today in an e-mailed statement. Deutsche Bank AG along with ING
Bank NV, Natixis, UniCredit Bank AG, WestLB AG and BNP Paribas
were the deal arrangers and book runners, according to the
statement.  The lenders plan to launch syndication to a wider bank
group in September as they target an increase of the loan
amount, according to the statement.  Metinvest is owned by Ukraine’s richest businessman  Rinat Akhmetov .  To contact the reporter on this story:
