Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) ’s Jane Sadowsky, a banker to power and utility companies such as  Exelon
Corp. (EXC)  and  AES Corp. (AES) , has left the New York-based investment
bank.  Sadowsky was a senior managing director in New York since
joining Evercore from  Citigroup Inc. (C)  in 2006. Her departure was
confirmed by Kenny Juarez, a company spokesman, and was reported
last week by Sparkspread, an online publication that follows the
power and utilities industry.  Sadowsky advised Chicago-based Exelon on its proposed $7.9
billion acquisition of Baltimore’s Constellation Energy Group
Inc., agreed to in April.  Evercore plans to add utilities bankers later this year
when it completes its planned acquisition of Lexicon Partners
Ltd., a London-based boutique. Lexicon’s power and utilities
team includes Henry “Hal” Clark, a senior adviser who was head
of Citigroup’s power investment banking effort.  To contact the reporter on this story:
