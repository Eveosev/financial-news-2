Empresas CMPC SA (CMPC) , Chile’s second-
biggest forestry company, rose for a second day in Santiago
trading after posting a 37 percent increase in quarterly profit
on higher pulp prices and output.  CMPC gained 1.7 percent to 20,850 pesos at 2:29 p.m. New
York time. The stock has rebounded 9.3 percent in two days from
a 16 percent plunge in the previous five sessions.  The company controlled by Chile’s Matte family reported
second-quarter profit of $167 million, up from $122 million a
year earlier, according to data published on the securities
regulator’s website. Sales rose 19 percent to $1.2 billion.  CMPC’s pulp operations, which accounted for 60 percent of
the company’s earnings before items in the first half of the
year, benefited from higher production volumes and prices.  “The increase in volumes can be explained mostly from the
suspension of plants in  Chile  due to the earthquake on Feb. 27,
2010,” CMPC said in a separate filing to regulators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
