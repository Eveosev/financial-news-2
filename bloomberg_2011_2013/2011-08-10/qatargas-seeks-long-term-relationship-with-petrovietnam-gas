Qatar Liquefied Gas Co. , known as
QatarGas, said it’s seeking a “long-term relationship” with
PetroVietnam Gas Corp.  Vietnam  can consume “significant quantities” of liquefied
natural gas, QatarGas said today in an e-mail.  PetroVietnam Gas, a unit of Vietnam Oil & Gas Co., will
purchase LNG from QatarGas, Saigon Giai Phong reported today

world’s biggest producer of gas cooled to a liquefied for
transport by ship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
