The  European Central Bank ’s
purchases of Italian and Spanish government bonds fell yesterday
from a day earlier and it may be wary of pushing yields too much
lower, according to Barclays Plc.  “The ECB continued to buy Spanish and Italian bonds, but
much less than on Monday,”  Laurent Fransolet , head of European
fixed-income strategy research in London, wrote in a research
report today. “It is not a surprise that the performance of
Spain and Italy was limited. If yields or spreads become too
tight/low, it could generate new selling by investors or limit
demand when supply comes back to the market in September.”  Italian 10-year yields fell 11 basis points to 5.18 percent
yesterday, after a drop of 81 basis points the previous day.
Spanish 10-year bond yields declined eight basis points to 5.08
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
