A drop in commodity prices may help
lower borrowing costs in  India , and increasing competitiveness
of the country’s exports against  China  will quicken economic
growth, the nation’s second-biggest money manager said.  “Lower prices of oil in particular and other commodities
in general could trigger a reversal in the trend of rising
 interest rates ,” Prashant Jain, chief investment officer at
HDFC Asset Management Co., which manages $20 billion in assets,
said in a note to investors.  The S&P GSCI Spot Index of 24 materials yesterday slid to
the lowest level since Dec. 2, and oil touched a 10-month low,
amid the financial turmoil triggered by the Standard & Poor’s
cutting U.S.’s AAA rating. India’s central bank has persisted
with the most aggressive monetary tightening among major Asian
economies to tackle inflation, contributing to the 16 percent
decline in the benchmark  stock index  this year.  “India is one of the few emerging economies that is a net
importer of commodities, oil being the largest,” Jain said in
the note titled ‘It is always darkest before dawn’. “Every $20
fall saves the country $18 billion per annum, equivalent of 1.1
percent of gross domestic product. Lower oil means lower fiscal
deficit, lower inflation, lower interest rates over time.”  Shipments from India are “gaining in competitiveness”
against China because of the depreciation of the rupee versus
the yuan and the higher wage inflation in China, Jain said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
