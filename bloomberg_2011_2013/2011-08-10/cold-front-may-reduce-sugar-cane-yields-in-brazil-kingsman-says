A cold front forecast to reach sugar
cane-growing areas at the end of the month in  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer, may further reduce yields, according
to broker and researcher Kingsman SA.  A new cold front is expected in southern Brazil after Aug.
20, Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agronomist at forecaster Somar
Meteorologia, said in a report e-mailed Aug. 8. Cane yields in
the country’s main producing region, Center South, fell 3.2
percent from the start of the harvest to July 16, data from
industry group Unica showed.  “A new wave of low temperatures is forecasted in the
Center South region for the end of August,” Kingsman said in a
report e-mailed today. “This could reduce cane yields even
further.”  A frost in June helped cut cane output this year, Unica
said. The Center South cane crop will fall to 533.5 million
metric tons this year, the first drop in a decade, it estimated.
There are no reports so far of further damage from a second
frost that reached producing areas last week, Kingsman added.  “Cold or freezing temperatures may affect the sugar
production, however, damages are very difficult to measure at
time being,” Fabienne Pointier, an analyst at Lausanne,
Switzerland-based Kingsman, said in an e-mailed response to
questions today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
