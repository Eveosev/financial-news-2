Thomas Keller’s Per Se is
axiomatically the best choice for a New York client dinner
because it is, after all, Per Se. On the other hand, it will set
your company back $295 per person.  Expense account dollars are tight as the beleaguered U.S.
economy soldiers on. So here, in alphabetical order, are a few
joints for business meals that range from good spot for everyday
sales dinner to “we dare you to expense this.” And while none
of these restaurants is necessarily cheap, we like to think of
them all as relative values.  Even Per Se.  1. Adour  Alain Ducasse : 2 E. 55th St. Information: +1-212-710-
2277;  http://www.adour-stregis.com .  What: Fancy Southern French.  Why: Because Chef Didier Elena only charges $115 for his
stunning tasting menu. Creekstone beef with black truffle sauce
is included, as it should be.  Where: Midtown East, at the St. Regis Hotel.  When: You’re entertaining discerning diners who don’t eat
meat. An $85 vegetable tasting is stellar. Pear, apple and
radish carpaccio should be part of your daily diet. Pair with a
bottle of Dom Perignon 1969 ($3,500) for special occasions.  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: Two private spaces seat up to 16 each.  Sound level: Muted.  2. Ai Fiori: 400 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-613-8660;
 http://www.aifiorinyc.com .  What: Riviera cuisine.  Why: Because  Michael White , an Italian chef, just might run
the city’s best Southern French restaurant.  Where: The Setai Hotel.  When: You’re craving a quiet and civilized experience in
the dark heart of Midtown, near the Empire State Building. Order
the squid ink pasta with shellfish; the noodles are impossibly
brinier than the sweet mollusks. Prix-fixe menu is $84; the
tasting is $120.  Bar: Yes, full menu.  Private Room: Around 12-32 people.  Sound level: Whisper-safe.  3. Beauty & Essex: 146 Essex St. Information: +1-212-614-0146;
 http://www.beautyandessex.com .  What: International club cuisine  Why: Because sometimes you want to dance after dinner.  Where: Lower East Side  When: Your client demands a place where he can listen to
Rihanna pipe through the sound system while eating umami-packed
Kobe carpaccio. Beauty & Essex is one of  New York ’s more
tolerable big-box joints.  Bar: Yes, and free bubbly in the ladies room. An excuse to
cross-dress if ever there was one.  Private Room: Yes, 20-65.  Sound level: High-ish.  4. Le Bernardin: 155 W. 51st St. Information: +1-212-489-1515;
 http://www.le-bernardin.com .  What: Seafood.  Why: Chef Eric Ripert dazzles with dishes such as ethereal
fluke marinated in soy sauce and yuzu. Warning: Sommeliers can
be hard to hail if you’re a light spender.  Where: Midtown West near  Carnegie Hall .  When: Later this summer; the restaurant’s undergoing a
much-needed renovation. Will “The Ripper” raise prices on his
$115, $140 and $190 menus after reopening?  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: About 2-80 guests.  Sound level: Easy on the conversations.  5.  Brooklyn  Fare: 200 Schermerhorn St., Brooklyn. Information:
1-718-243-0050 or  http://www.brooklynfare.com/chefs-table .  What: A 20-25-course tasting menu of French-Japanese small
plates. Lots of sashimi.  Why: Because Cesar Ramirez has a sure eye for raw fish. How
about sea urchin with truffles? A single bite of fried
langoustine with basil is the salad of the sea. One of the
toughest tables in New York.  Where: Downtown Brooklyn.  When: Only when you can leave business at the office.
Ramirez asks that guests not use cellphones or BlackBerrys.  Bar: Nope, just a long chef’s counter. Bring your own wine,
beer or sake for now.  Private Room: Brooklyn Fare is a private room. You can
reserve the entire space for around $330 per person, which works
out to $6,000 or so.  Sound level: Convivial.  6. Blue Hill at Stone Barns: 630 Bedford Rd., Pocantico Hills.
Information: +1-914-366-9600;  http://bluehillfarm.com .  What: Haute-barnyard American.  Why: Located in the old Rockefeller estate barns. Enjoy Dan Barber’s $208 farmer’s feast, which may include meat from the
farm’s livestock. Shorter $148 and $108 menus are also
available. I recommend the veal brains -- the jiggly, savory,
Indiana Jones response to panna cotta.  Where: Pocantico Hills, Westchester County.  When: You’re fixing to use the company car service. A
beautiful 30-minute ride from  Manhattan .  Bar: Yes, full menu.  Private Room: Seats up to 64.  Sound level: Quiet but not hushed.  7. Brushstroke: 30 Hudson St. Information: +1-212-791-3771;
 http://www.davidbouley.com .  What: Japanese Kaiseki  Why: Because David Bouley’s French and German sensibilities
keep the austerity of Kyoto cuisine in check. So expect egg
custard with truffle sauce and pork cheeks with green apple
puree.  Where: Tribeca  When: You want a discount tasting menu. Eight courses are
just $85.  Bar: Yes, and the small plates served at the counter
sometimes best the main dining room’s menu. Fermented tofu and
stewed Wagyu are the must-have dishes.  Private Room: No, but private parties are accommodated.  Sound level: Respectful.  8. Corton: 239 West Broadway. Information: +1-212-219-2777;
 http://www.cortonnyc.com .  What: Artistic, avant-garde French.  Why: Two contradictory things have happened since Drew Nieporent opened Corton in 2008. First, the service has fallen
off a cliff. Second, Paul Liebrandt’s cuisine has reached four-
star territory. Perhaps that’s why he raised his menu prices to
$115 and $155 this summer.  Where: Tribeca.  When: When you want the city’s best salad. Liebrandt’s
creation, a homage to Laguiole’s Michel Bras, contains well over
a dozen different herbs and vegetables.  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: No.  Sound level: Lively until people get their main course.
Then suddenly silent except for the “aaaahs.”  9. Cafe Boulud: 20 E. 76th St.; +1-212-772-2600;
 http://www.danielnyc.com .  What: Global French  Why: Because sometimes you don’t want the formality of
Daniel. It’s like the French version of Nobu Next Door.  Where: Upper East Side.  When: You have a hankering for internationalism mixed with
Gallic sensibility. Thank Chef Gavin Kaysen for creations like
duo of lamb, prepared Indian “Rogan Josh” style.  Bar: Yes, right across the hallway.  Private Room: Yes, can accommodate 18-40 people.  Sound level: Easy on the ears.  10. Craft: 43 E. 19th St. Information: +1-212-780-0880;
 http://www.craftrestaurant.com .  What: Haute-barnyard American.  Why: Considered one of the city’s best American
restaurants. Simple, straightforward cuisine. This is the place
that started the “hen of the woods” mushroom craze. The quail
with 50-year balsamic is life-changing.  Where: Gramercy Park.  When: For informality in your fine dining.  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: A secluded space actually has a separate
entrance outside. Seats up to 40 or so.  Sound level: No stress.  11. Daniel: 60 E. 65th St. Information: +1-212-288-0033;
 http://www.danielnyc.com .  What: Fancy French  Why: Because  Daniel Boulud  is your go-to Lyonnais chef in
New York. That means he can manipulate meats, sausages and
pigeons better than others. Black Angus short ribs with seared
Wagyu tenderloin is the right call.  Where: Upper East Side  When: You don’t need an eight-hour tasting menu. Get in and
out with the $108 three-course prix-fixe.  Bar: Yes; it serves the full tasting menus.  Private Room: Yes, 8-100 guests.  Sound level: What you would expect in a temple of food.  12. Dovetail: 103 W. 77th St. Information: +1-212-362-3800;
 http://dovetailnyc.com .  What: The most ambitious American restaurant above West
60th Street.  Why: Because Chef John Fraser earned himself a Michelin
star. His other restaurant, What Happens When, closed in Nolita
after silly community opposition.  Where: The Upper West Side.  When: You’re hanging with a hedge-fund client who also
teaches a class at  Columbia University . There are more of them
than you think. Feast on the tasting menus ($77-$135), or the a
la carte selection ($14-$42). Try the Riesling wine pairings
this summer.  Private Room: Seats 10-20.  Sound level:  Respectful.  13. The Dutch: 131 Sullivan St. Information: +1-212-677-6200;
 http://thedutchnyc.com .  What: Steakhouse and American Brasserie  Why: Because this is Andrew Carmellini’s return to form.
Poached shrimp aren’t chilled into a bland submission, they’re
served warm and head on.  Where: SoHo  When: You want steaks that are as good as Minetta Tavern
without the hassle of getting past a doorman. Yes, it can get
loud so ask for a seat in the quieter Sullivan Room.  Bar: Yes, but it’s three deep unless you come in the after-
hours, a good idea anyway since that’s when the $17 burger is
served.  Private Room: Yes, for 14-60 people.  Sound level: Vivacious.  14. Eleven Madison Park: 11 Madison Ave. at East 24th Street.
Information: +1-212-889-0905;  http://www.elevenmadisonpark.com   What: Fancy European fare with American flourishes.  Why: Chef Daniel Humm’s offerings aren’t necessarily on a
par with New York’s very best restaurants, but the Danny Meyer
service machine, under the leadership of general manager Will
Guidara, edges this staple closer and closer to four-star
territory. The soaring Art Deco room is like a Grand Central
Terminal for wealthy non-commuters.  When: For a $125 four-course dinner, with multiple amuses,
intermezzos, petits fours and tours of the kitchen. Truly one of
the city’s great values.  Private Room: For extravagant parties, private balcony
rooms overlook Madison Square Park. The spaces can handle 18, 32
or 50 people.  Sound level: Enjoyably low-key.  15. 15 East: 15 E. 15th St. Information: +1-212-647-0015;
 http://www.15eastrestaurant.com .  What: Sashimi and sushi and sake and shochu.  Why: Because Chef Masato Shimizu serves pristine sushi one
piece at a time. He sauces each morsel, so no need to dip in soy
sauce. Savor the temperature contrast: warm fish over cool rice.
This is called Edo-style sushi. Eat at the bar and nowhere else.  Where: Union Square.  When: If you don’t feel like blowing $1,000-plus at Masa or
Kuruma Zushi.  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: No.  Sound level: Buzzy.  16. Gotham Bar & Grill: 12 E. 12th St. Information: +1-212-620-
4020  http://www.gothambarandgrill.com .  What: New American  Why: Because Alfred Portale, having logged almost 30 years
at this downtown icon, still has gustatory game. Label Rouge
chicken, crisped and with green-olive sauce is worth the price
of the $110 tasting menu.  Where: Right across from Strip House in  Greenwich Village .  When: Whenever you want to try a clean soubise or a
vadouvan curry sauce. Don’t worry, things aren’t as vertical or
as architectural as they used to be in the 1980s.  Bar: Yes, and it serves the full menu.  Private Room: No, but can accommodate large private
parties.  Sound level: Moderate.  17. Kin Shop: 469 Sixth Ave. Information: +1-212-675-4295;
 http://www.kinshopnyc.com .  What: The city’s best Thai restaurant.  Why: Because Chef Harold Dieterle’s odd pairing of oysters
with pork-belly salad is so intuitively delicious the diner will
wonder whether he sources his pigs from Peconic Bay.  Where: Greenwich Village.  When: Your client wants food so spicy her scalp will sweat.
The perspirant business traveler can seek relief from the $60
tasting menu’s heat with a $25 beer pairing.  Bar: Yes, a chef’s counter too.  Private Room: No; buyouts start at $6,000-$10,000 before
tax & service charge.  Sound level: Gets noisy.  18. Ma Peche: 15 W. 56th St. Information: +1-212-757-5878;
 http://www.momofuku.com .  What: French-Vietnamese Steakhouse  Why: Because Chef Tien Ho serves one of the city’s finest
steaks. He takes a shoulder cut, sous-vides it for hours, then
sears it. Tastes like beef that’s been marinated in beef. Not
for beginners. Neither is the $450 steak tasting menu (for 4-8
people).  Where: Midtown  When: You’re stuck in Midtown.  Bar: Yes, upstairs and they serve a “short” bourbon and
coke when you don’t have time for a “long” lunch.  Private Room: Multiple options from 2 to 100 guests.  Sound level: Chattering class.  19. Marea: 240 Central Park South. Information: +1-212-582-5100;
 http://marea-nyc.com .  What: Coastal Italian fare.  Why: Because Michael White is the city’s best purveyor of
pasta. And because there are no grander locations than the old
San Domenico space on Central Park South.  Where: Midtown  When: When your client needs to stay in Midtown. Order the
orecchiette with ruby-red shrimp and tomato sauce. It sounds
light, but there’s enough butter to kill a cow. Some argue that
White serves the city’s best Dover Sole. Order a la carte, or go
prix-fixe, starting at $91.  Bar: Yes, it’s where you can grab a last-minute dinner as a
walk-in. Full menu.  Private Room: Yes, holds up to 16-26 guests.  Sound level: Low-moderate.  20. Momofuku Ko: 163 First Ave., near East 10th Street. No
Phone;  http://reservations.momofuku.com .  What: Modern American, with hints of Korean and Japanese.  Why: One of New York’s toughest tables. Reservations only
taken online, one week in advance, at 10 a.m. Counter-only
seating. Set dinner menu is $125; a longer $175 service is
available at lunch. Expect really good pork rinds and even
better foie gras.  Where: East Village.  When: Whenever you can get in. That in itself will impress
a client. Just keep it to yourself that reservations are quite
easy to come by if you log onto the site in the afternoon;
everyone crowds each other out in the morning.  Bar: The restaurant is a bar.  Private Room: If you count the bathroom.  Sound level: Moderate.  21. Per Se: Time Warner Center, 10 Columbus Circle. Information:
+1-212-823-9335;  http://www.perseny.com .  What: French-influenced modern American.  Why: Because  Thomas Keller ’s three-star Michelin restaurant
approaches perfection. The tables are so far apart you won’t be
able to hear any other conversation but yours. Waiters are
everywhere. The flavors are powerful. Cauliflower panna cotta
with oyster gelee and caviar defines creaminess and brininess.  Where: Time Warner Center.  When: Whenever you feel like spending $295 for nine
courses. Service included. Tables for four are easier to swing
two-tops. That favors big spenders willing to pick up the tab.  Bar: Yes. A la carte dishes served in tasting-menu portions
at entree prices ($28-$125). Your date will be impressed when
you sit down on a couch overlooking Central Park South.  Private Room: The East Room seats 10. The West Room seats
up to 60.  Sound level: What sound?  22. Torrisi Italian Specialties: 250 Mulberry St. Information:
+1-212-965-0955;  http://www.piginahat.com   What: High-end Italian-American.  Why: Because Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone are trained
French chefs bringing a fine-dining approach to Little  Italy .
The nouveau red-sauce fare includes a life-changing pork chop
with vinegar made from B&G peppers. Torrisi’s service is more
refined than when it first opened up last year.  Where: Mulberry and Prince.  When: You have time to wait in line for a table. No
reservations. Four courses will set you back $50 bucks.  Bar: Not really.  Private Room: No. Buyouts start at $6,000-$8,000 before tax
and a 23 percent administrative fee.  Sound level: Convivial.  (Ryan Sutton reviews restaurants for Muse, the arts and
