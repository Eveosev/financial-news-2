Middle East crude-oil grades for
sale to  Asia  fell against benchmark prices amid signs that
processing profits for refineries are declining.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., was at a
premium of 6 cents a barrel to its official selling price from a
premium of 8 cents on Aug. 8, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News. Qatar Marine’s discount widened to 18 cents a
barrel from 13 cents two days earlier, Bloomberg data show.  Demand for crude may be slowing as refiners’ processing
profits decline. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai, a measure of
profitability, shrank 3.5 percent this week to $18.54 a barrel
today, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-
based broker.  Oman crude for immediate loading slid 0.2 percent to
$101.12 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil for delivery
in October shed 19 cents to $100.70. Murban fell 21 cents to
$104.72 a barrel.  Oman futures for October delivery rose 4.3 percent to
$101.37 a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 6:28 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,047 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $100.43 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The September Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which
measures the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf
grade, rose 6.3 percent to $5.05 a barrel, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates. The exchange for swaps for October
climbed 22 cents to $4.71.  To contact the reporter on this story:
