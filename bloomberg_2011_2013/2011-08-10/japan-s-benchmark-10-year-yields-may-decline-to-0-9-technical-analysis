Japan ’s 10-year government bond
yields may decline to a nine-month low of 0.9 percent after
breaking below the key level of 1 percent, Mizuho Securities Co.
said, citing trading patterns.  Indicators that track the market’s trend, such as the
moving average conversion-divergence, or MACD, signal yields may
slide to the target over the next month, said  Tetsuya Miura ,
chief market analyst at Japan’s second-largest bank by market
value. The MACD was -0.0261 yesterday, below the so-called
signal line of -0.0217, based on Bloomberg data. A reading under
the signal line suggests the yield will decrease.  “The indicators have yet to signal the market is
overheated,” Miura said. “Yields may decline further.”  Benchmark yields dropped to as low as 0.975 percent
yesterday, the least since Nov. 12. They were little changed at
1.03 percent as of 10:47 a.m. in  Tokyo .  The fair value of Japan’s 10-year yields is 1.07 percent,
if U.S. yields are at about 2.5 percent and the three-month
Tokyo interbank offered rate, or Tibor, is near 0.3 percent,
Miura said. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.29 percent today
and Tibor held at 0.339 percent yesterday.  MACD is a gauge of momentum is calculated by subtracting
the 26-day exponential moving average from the 12-day average.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
