Lear Corp. (LEA) , a maker of seats and
other automobile parts, said its finance chief will succeed Bob Rossiter, who steps down as chief executive officer Sept. 1.  Matt Simoncini, 50, has been Lear’s chief financial officer
since September 2007. He has worked at Southfield, Michigan-
based Lear and its predecessor companies since 1996. He will
join Lear’s board upon taking over as CEO.  Simoncini said he sees no changes in strategy. Lear, which
has net cash of $1.1 billion, is looking at acquisitions of as
much as $200 million to expand its electrical connectors and
components unit as well as seat mechanisms and fabrics, he said.  “We have a great book of business with the domestic
automakers but the real growth opportunities longer term are in
the international markets,” Simoncini said in an interview.
“The business is out there.”  Rossiter, 65, spent 40 years at the company and its
predecessors, most recently shepherding Lear through a four-
month bankruptcy in 2009 after the global auto sales slowdown
sapped auto production. He has been CEO since 2000. Rossiter
will remain with the company in an advisory role through May.  Lear fell 56 cents, or 1.3, percent, to $42.60 at 4:05 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
fallen 14 percent this year.  The company’s three-largest customers are Detroit-based
 General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F) , based in Dearborn, Michigan,
and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , based in Munich,  Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
