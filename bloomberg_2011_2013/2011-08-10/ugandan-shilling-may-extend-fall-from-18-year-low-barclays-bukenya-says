Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s third
worst-performing currency this year, may weaken further from an
18-year low against the dollar on demand from manufacturers for
the U.S. currency, said Faisal Bukenya, head of  currency trading 
at  Barclays Bank  of Uganda Ltd.  The East African nation’s currency could fall as much as
1.8 percent by Aug. 12 if the central bank doesn’t sell dollars
to ease supplies amid increasing demand by manufacturers seeking
to import raw materials, Bukenya said by phone from Kampala, the
capital, today.  The currency of Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer
weakened 0.6 percent to 2,750 per dollar at 4 p.m. local time,
the weakest level since at least June 22, 1993, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Uganda’s shilling has slumped 15
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
