Uranium One Inc. (UUU) , a Canadian miner
controlled by a unit of Russia’s state nuclear company, advanced
the most in almost three years in Johannesburg trading after
reporting profit jumped fivefold during the second quarter.  The company’s shares rose as much as 34 percent, the most
since Nov. 4, 2008. Uranium One, based in Vancouver and with
operations in Kazakhstan, the U.S. and Australia, posted net
income of $29.7 million, up from $5.4 million a year before.  “Broader growth rates for nuclear power remain robust on
the strength of the emerging markets of  China , India, Russia and
the  Middle East ,” it said in a statement. “The corporation
believes that market conditions will continue to be favorable
for lower cost, diversified producers like Uranium One.”  Uranium One, controlled by ARMZ Uranium Holding, gained 17
percent to 22.82 rand by 2:07 p.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
