Turkey ’s stock index plunged to the
lowest in almost 15 months as the cost of insuring French debt
surged on concern that global growth will stall and debt
problems on  Europe ’s periphery can’t be contained.  The benchmark  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  lost 5 percent to
50,307.58 at the 5:30 close in Istanbul.  France ’s borrowing costs are rising as Europe’s debt crisis
makes investors wary of lending to any nation other than
 Germany . Turkey is considered especially vulnerable to economic
problems in Europe, its biggest export market, because of its
record current-account deficit and the lira near record lows.  “Because of its huge current-account deficit and fear of a
weaker currency, Turkey is viewed as more risky, more fragile
and highly volatile,” Haydar Acun, managing partner of
Istanbul-based Sardis Securities, said in e-mailed responses to
questions.  The current-account deficit, which measures the difference
between a country’s imports and exports, more than doubled in
May from a year ago to $7.8 billion, taking the 12-month deficit
to $68.2 billion, equivalent to about 9 percent of the
government’s estimate for economic output this year. June data
is due on Aug. 11.  The Turkish index has lost 20 percent in the past nine days
of trading, extending a decline since the beginning of the year
that was equal to 34 percent on a dollar basis as of today’s
close.  The ISE 100 Index’s 14-day relative strength index, or RSI,
sank to 18.26 today, below the threshold of 30 that indicates
the market should be poised for a rally, according to technical
analysis. The last time the RSI fell that low was in June 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
