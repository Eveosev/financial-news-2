The opposition Czech Social
Democrats asked ruling coalition experts to postpone parts of
the pension revamp by at least a year because of the financial
markets’ slump, Pravo reported, citing Jan Mladek, the party’s
shadow finance minister.  Czech lawmakers approved in July the first reading of bills
aimed at overhauling the pension system and boosting private
savings for retirement. The bills will allow people to redirect
part of compulsory pension payments into personal accounts
managed by pension funds from 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
