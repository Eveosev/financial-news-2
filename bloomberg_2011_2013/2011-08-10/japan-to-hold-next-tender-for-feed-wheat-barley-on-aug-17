Japan  will hold a tender for a
maximum of 50,000 metric ton s of feed wheat and 200,000 tons of
feed barley on Aug. 17, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries said today.  The ministry, which holds feed-grain import tenders every
Wednesday, didn’t purchase anything today because of a lack of
demand from end-users, Masafumi Otsuka at the ministry’s grain
trade division, said by phone.  Tenders are held under the so-called simultaneous buy-and-
sell system.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　  To contact the reporter on this story:
