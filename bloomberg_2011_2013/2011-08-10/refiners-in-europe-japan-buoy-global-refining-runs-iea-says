 Refiners in Europe,  Japan  and the
former Soviet Union will process more crude into fuels in the
third quarter, bolstering global throughput rates, the
 International Energy Agency  said.  Refiners will process 75.9 million barrels a day in the
third quarter, up 500,000 barrels a day from a year earlier, the
Paris-based adviser said in its monthly report today. The IEA
cut its forecast for Chinese third-quarter processing volumes.  European refiners are benefitting from the release of
light, sweet crude under the agency’s stockpile release program
in early July, according to the report. Japan is raising crude
runs in spite of two facilities still being closed by this
year’s earthquake, the IEA said.  The IEA cut its refining forecast for countries outside the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development by 220,000
barrels a day as Chinese demand slows and after the halt of
 Taiwan ’s Mailiao refinery.  Chinese crude runs hit a nine-month low of 8.7 million
barrels a day in June and maintenance plans point to lower
operating rates in July, the IEA said. “Annual growth in
throughputs could slow in line with sharply lower demand growth
at the end of this year,” it said on  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
