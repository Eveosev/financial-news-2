Researchers in  Ivory Coast  and
 Nigeria  will test about 40 different types of sugar cane in a
bid to boost production of the sweetener by small-scale farmers,
according to the Ivorian National Center for Agronomic Research.  The  United Nations ’ Common Fund for Commodities has given
$1.6 million for the project, said Amoncho Adiko, head of the
center’s development-support program. The two West African
nations will supply the rest of the $2.1 million total, he said
by phone Aug. 5 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s commercial capital.  “Villagers need a variety of cane that grows with the
rain,” Adiko said. They differ from industrial-scale sugar
producers, which use irrigation techniques to keep their farms
watered, he said.  Small-scale farmers cover just 3,700 hectares (9,143
acres), compared with larger producers that grow cane on 22,000
hectares, he said. Annual output of sugar cane in  Ivory Coast  is
150,000 metric tons or 15,000 tons of refined sugar, Adiko said.  Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest cocoa producer, will test
the varieties from Mauritius, Brazil, Sudan,  South Africa  and
Swaziland in the northern area of Ferkessedougou and the
central-west zone of Zuenoula, Adiko said. The new varieties of
sugar cane will be distributed after the research, which is
expected to last about five years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
