8.2 percent, to 318.96 rand. Gold gained after the U.S. Federal

Newcastle operation in  South Africa  has rendered its blast
furnace inoperable.  Bell Equipment Ltd. (BEL)  , a manufacturer of handling
machinery, rose 30 cents, or 2.2 percent, to 14 rand. Net income

zinc rallied.  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX)  , the coal miner that exports
about 38 percent of its production, rose for the first day in
