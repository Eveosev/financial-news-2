Poland’s WIG20 Index tumbled 119.41,
or 5.2 percent, to 2,194.07 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
sliding for an eighth consecutive session and posting the
longest losing streak since 2001.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, slid
1.75 zloty, or 5 percent, to 33.1 zloty and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , majority-owned by UniCredit SpA, lost 9.5 zloty, or 6.8
percent, to 129.5 zloty. Bank Handlowy SA (BHW PW), a unit of
Citigroup Inc., lost 6.55 zloty, or 9.5 percent, to 62.45 zloty.  Banks fell across  Europe  as the  Federal Reserve ’s plan to
keep  interest rates  low to bolster the economy failed to ease
investors’ concern that the recovery is stalling.  Getin Holding SA (GTN)  , the financial-services group
controlled by Polish billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, fell 0.52
zloty, or 6.1 percent, to 7.98 zloty, sliding for a 13 day, as
the zloty extended losses against the Swiss franc. Getin is
among eastern European lenders whose earnings are most
vulnerable if a decline in the zloty worsens the quality of
franc-denominated home loan portfolios, ING Groep NV said
yesterday.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, sank 8.5 zloty, or 5.1 percent, to
159.5 zloty, the lowest close since December, as the price of
the metal declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
