Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
lender that acquired ING Direct USA, may be downgraded by  Fitch
Ratings  after agreeing to buy the U.S. credit-card division from
 HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   The bank was put on “rating watch negative” because of
“concerns about integration risk and funding risk as the HSBC
card acquisition comes on the heels of the sizeable acquisition
of ING,” the ratings firm said today in a statement on the
McLean, Virginia-based Capital One.  To contact the reporter on this story:
