China , the world’s biggest buyer of
iron ore, boosted purchases by 6.8 percent in July as
steelmakers start to replenish stockpiles on expectations
seasonal demand for the raw material in autumn may lift prices.  Imports climbed to 54.55 million metric tons last month,
compared with 51.09 million tons in June, according to China’s
General Administration of Customs. That’s 6.4 percent higher
than 51.28 million tons of a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s steel output in July fell 1 percent to 59.3 million
tons from a month ago as power shortages affected some
production, according to data released by the National
Statistics Bureau yesterday. Steelmakers usually ramp up
production in September and October as the power restrictions
ease, stoking  iron ore  consumption and prices, analysts and
traders said.  “There were more auctions of iron ore from Brazil and
 Australia  in July,” said Xu Guangjian. People are preparing for
“the traditional peak season starting from September.”  The cash price of 62 percent-iron ore arriving at China’s
Tianjin port has risen for five straight weeks, gaining 0.06
percent on Aug. 8 to $178.10 a ton, according to the Steel
Index. It’s still 7.2 percent lower than a record $191.90 in
February.  Imports gained 7.9 percent to 388.63 million tons in
January-July from a year earlier, the customs office said today.  Steel-product exports rose 3.5 percent to 4.44 million tons
last month from 4.29 million tons in June, according to the
data. The shipments were up 2.3 percent to 28.77 million tons in
January to July from a year earlier, the customs said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
