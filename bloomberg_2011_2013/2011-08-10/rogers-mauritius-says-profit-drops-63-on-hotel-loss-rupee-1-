Rogers & Co., a Mauritian company
with interests in tourism and financial services, said profit
fell 63 percent in the third quarter as increased room capacity
placed pressure on hotel rates and the rupee strengthened.  Net income retreated to 12.6 million rupees ($450,000) in
the three months through June from 33.9 million rupees a year
earlier, it said in a  statement  on the Port Louis-based Stock
Exchange of Mauritius’s website today. Profit at the financial-
services unit, the biggest division by revenue, declined 47
percent to 62 million rupees, while the loss reported by the
hotels segment narrowed to 130 million rupees from 136 million
rupees a year earlier.  The rupee appreciated 1.4 percent against the dollar
percent in the second quarter of this year and it gained 15
percent in the year through June, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Hotel operators are facing a difficult low season as
the increase in room capacity and growing tourist demand for
non-hotel structures resulted in additional pressure on room
rates and occupancy levels, the company said.  “Given the prevailing trading conditions, the performance
of the hotels and global business activities will remain
challenged for the last quarter,” the company said. “Although
the results of the group for the year are expected to be in line
with those of last year, the current decrease in earnings per
share shall be maintained for the full year.”  Tourism is one of Mauritius’s main sources of foreign
currency, with revenue expected to rise by 7.7 percent to 42.5
billion rupees ($1.5 billion) in 2011, according to the  Central
Statistics Office .  Rogers, which owns six hotels, said revenue for the nine
months through June rose 13 percent to 8 billion rupees, while
net income slumped 41 percent to 240 million rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
