Egypt’s inflation rate declined in
July as food prices, one of the causes of the unrest that
toppled President  Hosni Mubarak , rose at a slower pace.  The inflation rate in urban parts of Egypt, the gauge that
the central bank monitors, fell to 10.4 percent from 11.8
percent in June, according to data posted on the website of the
Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics today.
Food and beverage prices, the biggest component in the  consumer
price index , rose an annual 16.7 percent, from 19 percent a
month earlier. In the month, consumer prices rose 1.2 percent.  Eighteen days of protests in Egypt, sparked by falling
living standards and high unemployment as well as a lack of
democratic rights, led to the ouster of Mubarak on Feb. 11.
Economic growth may slow to 1 percent this year, the
 International Monetary Fund  has said, as the turmoil hurts
revenue from tourism and industrial output.  The central bank on July 21 left its overnight deposit rate
unchanged at 8.25 percent, the lowest level in more than four
years, and the overnight lending rate at 9.75 percent to support
economic growth.  The central bank has kept its benchmark  interest rate  on
hold since September 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
