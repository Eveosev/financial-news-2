Industrial output in  France , the
euro region’s second-biggest economy, fell more than economists
estimated in June on lower production of transport materials and
electronic goods.  Output from factories, mines and utilities decreased 1.6
percent from May, when it rose a revised 1.9 percent, national
statistics office Insee said today. Economists had forecast a
0.7 percent fall, according to the median of 12 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. Output rose 2.3 percent from a year
earlier.  As demand for exports slowed and  consumer spending  fell,
France’s economy probably grew at a slower pace in the second
quarter after expanding 0.9 percent in the three months through
March. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the country’s
gross domestic product to have risen 0.3 percent, according to
the median of 15 forecasts. Insee releases preliminary GDP data
for the second quarter on Aug. 12.  Confidence among French executives fell to the lowest in
more than 1 1/2 years in July amid concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis may undermine economic growth, the Bank of France’s
Business Sentiment Indicator showed this week. The countries
making up the euro don’t constitute an “optimal currency
zone,” French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said on Aug. 8,
adding that the region’s governance has been improved and will
get better.  Production of electronic equipment fell 3.8 percent in
June, while output of transport materials dropped 2.8 percent,
today’s report showed. Refineries gained 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
