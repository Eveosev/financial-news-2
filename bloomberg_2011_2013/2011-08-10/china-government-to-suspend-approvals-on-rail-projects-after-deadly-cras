China Railway Group Ltd. (601390)  plunged to
a record low in Hong Kong trading, and CSR Corp. tumbled after
the government announced a halt to new train projects following
last month’s fatal high-speed crash. Airlines surged.  China Railway fell 6.06 percent to HK$2.17, the lowest
intraday price since its debut in 2007. The builder also
yesterday scrapped plans for a 6.25 billion yuan ($978 million)
share sale. Trainmaker CSR dropped 7.6 percent to close at
HK$4.39. China Southern Airlines Co. jumped 6.9 percent.  The Chinese government yesterday said it will suspend
approvals for new rail projects and conduct safety checks on
existing lines following a July 23 high-speed train crash that
killed 40 people. CSR and  China  Railway have both plunged more
than 30 percent since the accident on concerns it may disrupt
the nation’s plans to spend 2.8 trillion yuan on railways
through 2015.  “The suspension of approvals for new projects was an
unexpected move,” said Jack Xu, a Shanghai-based analyst with
Sinopac Securities Asia Ltd. “Government policies are very
important for construction companies and equipment providers, so
investors are concerned about these companies’ earnings
prospects.”  China Railway let a mandate to sell new shares to its
government-controlled parent and other investors lapse due to an
“adjustment to the macroeconomic policies of the state,” it
said in a statement yesterday. CSR has also delayed a
shareholder vote on a proposed 11 billion yuan stock sale since
the crash.  China Railway intended to sell as many as 1.52 billion new
Shanghai-listed shares for at least 4.11 yuan apiece. Its stock
fell 0.6 percent to close at 3.19 yuan in  Shanghai . CSR, China’s
biggest trainmaker, dropped 1.7 percent to 5.28 yuan in the
city.  ‘All-Out’ Safety  The railway ministry has dispatched 47 teams of 180 people
for “all-out” safety inspections, the official Xinhua News
Agency said yesterday, citing Minister Sheng Guangzu. The speed
of trains running 350 kilometers an hour (217 miles an hour)
will be reduced to 300 kilometers an hour, and those operating
at 250 kilometers an hour will be cut to 200 kilometers an hour,
Xinhua said. Ticket prices will be lowered to reflect slower
speeds, according to Xinhua.  Shanghai also suspended sales of high-speed rail tickets
from Aug. 15 pending schedule changes, according to state-run
 China Central Television .  China Southern, the nation’s biggest carrier, jumped 6.9
percent to HK$4.95 at the 4 p.m. close in  Hong Kong , after
earlier climbing as high as HK$5.02. Second-ranked China Eastern
Airlines Corp. fell 6.5 percent to HK$3.61.  The July collision occurred near Wenzhou when a train lost
power after being struck by lightning and was rear-ended by a
second train, Xinhua said, citing the provincial emergency
office. A preliminary investigation attributed the crash to a
signaling fault.  To contact the reporter on this story:
