Indonesia’s rupiah strengthened the
most in almost nine months and bonds rose after the  Federal
Reserve  vowed to keep its policy rate near zero through mid-2013.  The currency rebounded from a five-week low after the Fed
said it is “prepared to employ” additional tools to boost the
 U.S. economy . Global funds raised ownership of Indonesia’s
government debt by almost 28 percent to 249.33 trillion rupiah
($29.2 billion) this year through Aug. 8, contributing to the
rupiah’s 5.2 percent appreciation in 2011. Southeast Asia’s
largest economy will grow 6.8 percent this year following an
expansion of 6.1 percent in 2010, according to the central bank.  “Indonesian assets are still in demand as the view on the
economy is positive,” said Wiwig Santoso, head of treasury and
markets at PT Bank DBS  Indonesia  in Jakarta.  The rupiah appreciated 0.6 percent, the most since Nov. 18,
to 8,533 per dollar as of 4:34 p.m. in Jakarta, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency fell to 8,609 yesterday,
the weakest level since June.  Capital inflows into Indonesia will continue following the
Fed’s decision to keep  interest rates  near a record low, Bank
Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution told reporters in Jakarta
today. Policy makers are preparing measures to “guard” against
rupiah volatility and have a crisis-management protocol to
anticipate market turmoil, Nasution said.  Ten-year benchmark bonds rose, snapping two days of losses.
The yield on the 8.25 percent notes due July 2021 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.94 percent,
according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
