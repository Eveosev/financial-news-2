Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency
strategist in  Singapore  at Westpac Banking Corp., comments on
the outlook for  India ’s rupee. The currency traded at 45.12 per
dollar as of 11:39 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “In the near term, anything above 45.50 in terms of one-
month non-deliverable forwards will still be seen in the market
as an opportunity to sell the dollar and buy the rupee. That has
proved to be a very good resistance level for the pair. Although
we still have to be cautious on Asian currencies, we have come a
long way from the lows of the dollar-Asian pair.  ‘‘The Fed’s actions will ultimately prove to be dollar-
negative in the medium term while Asian economies are going to
be experiencing capital inflows. So Asian currencies are going
to see appreciation in the medium term. Our forecast is that the
rupee will strengthen to 44.60 by the end of September.  ‘‘We are seeing our European financial stress index
starting to rise and this backdrop might not favor the rupee
given the Indian economy runs a current-account deficit. This
might leave it out of favor compared with currencies like the
 Singapore dollar . The rupee is not my top choice among Asian
currencies at the moment.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
