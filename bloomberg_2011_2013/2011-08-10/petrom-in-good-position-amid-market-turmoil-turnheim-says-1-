OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , the Romanian unit of
Austria’s  OMV AG (OMV) , is in a “good position” to weather current
market turmoil because it has low debt, said Chief Financial
Officer Daniel Turnheim said today in Bucharest.  He also warned that volatility in markets will be enormous
in the next period, without elaborating. Next year will be
unfavorable for the company’s Brazi power plant because of
hither gas prices and a lack of CO2 allocation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
