Thailand ’s baht advanced as regional
equities climbed after the  Federal Reserve  pledged to keep
 interest rates  near zero at least through mid-2013 and said it
may use additional tools to revive the  U.S. economy .  Exchange data show global funds sold $479 million more Thai
equities than they bought in the first two days of the week
after  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the U.S. credit rating by one
level to AA+ on Aug. 5. The Bank of Thailand hasn’t intervened
“much” in the market after S&P’s move, Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said yesterday.  “The market interpreted the Fed statement as a possible
sign of quantitative easing,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a
foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “More
quantitative easing would lead to investors diversifying into
other currencies, and that would support Asian currencies.”  The baht appreciated 0.2 percent to 29.86 per dollar as of
8:08 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 30.03 yesterday, the weakest level since Aug. 1. The
currency may trade in a range from 29.80 to 29.90 today, Disawat
said.  The yield on the government’s 5.25 percent bonds due May
2014 slid six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.39
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Global funds
bought $410 million more Thai bonds than they sold this month
through yesterday, adding to net purchases of $4.3 billion in
July, according to data from the Thai Bond Market Association.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, lost seven basis points to
3.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
