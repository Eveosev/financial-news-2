Job openings in the U.S. increased
in June for a second month, while hiring decelerated, a sign
businesses lack the confidence to take on needed staff.  The number of positions waiting to be filled rose by 75,000
to 3.11 million, according to Labor Department figures issued
today in  Washington . Hiring fell by 78,000 to 4.05 million.  Job growth in May and June was the weakest this year, while
revised data last month showed the world’s largest economy grew
at a 0.9 percent annual pace in the first half of 2011. The lack
of momentum and plunge in stock prices on concern the recovery
is faltering may cause employers to delay hiring even more.  “Total job openings have been flat since February and
about one-third below pre-recession levels,” Henry Mo, a senior
economist at Credit Suisse in  New York , said before the report.
“We are concerned that corporations may further postpone or
even freeze their hiring plans given the current violent market
conditions and murky growth outlook.”  Another report today showed inventories at U.S. wholesalers
climbed in June at the slowest pace in seven months as
distributors kept stockpiles in line with sales. The 0.6 percent
increase in goods on hand followed a revised 1.7 percent rise in
May, Commerce Department figures showed. Sales also climbed 0.6
percent after dropping the previous month.  Shares Drop  Stocks fell, following the biggest gain since 2009 for
benchmark indexes, amid concern over the outlook for U.S. growth
and that  Europe  will fail to contain its sovereign-debt crisis.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 3.4 percent to 1,132.69 at
10:47 a.m. in New York.  Job openings increased 2.5 percent in June from a revised
3.03 million in May that was higher than initially reported, the
data showed.  The gain in vacancies was broad-based, with professional
and business services, retail and leisure and hospitality
companies all showing increases.  Today’s report helps shed light on the dynamics behind the
monthly employment figures. Payrolls rose in July by 117,000
after a 46,000 gain the prior month that was larger than
initially reported, Labor Department figures showed Aug. 5.  Employers discharged 1.79 million workers in June, down
from 1.84 million in May, the report also showed. Total
separations, which include firings, retirements and those who
left their jobs voluntarily, decreased to 4.02 million from 4.15
million a month before.  12-Month Gain  In the 12 months ended in June, the economy created a net 1
million jobs, representing about 47.7 million hires and about
46.7 million separations, today’s report showed.  Compared with the 14.1 million Americans who were
unemployed in June, today’s figures indicate there were almost
five people vying for every opening, up from about two when the
recession began in December 2007.  The number of jobless fell to 13.9 million in July, pushing
the  unemployment rate  down to 9.1 percent from 9.2 percent the
previous month, the Labor Department reported last week.  Consumer spending  dropped in June for the first time in
almost two years as a hiring slowdown caused households to
retrench. Purchases fell 0.2 percent last month after a 0.1
percent gain the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed
last week.  Slowing job growth and a weakening economy were among
reasons cited by Federal Reserve policy makers yesterday in
their decision to keep the benchmark lending rate near zero “at
least” through mid-2013.  Slowing sales is one of the reasons  San Jose , California-
based  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the largest networking-equipment
maker, announced last month it plans to eliminate about 6,500
jobs.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  also said it will cut payrolls by
about 1,000 workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
