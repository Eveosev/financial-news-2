The U.S. Army is forming a  task
force  to work with developers that may spend as much as $7.1
billion over the next decade to build renewable power plants at
U.S. military sites.  The Energy Initiatives Office Task Force is expected to be
established by Sept. 15, the Army said today in a  statement .  The task force will help the Army reach a target of getting
25 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2025, Army
Secretary John McHugh said today in a conference call.  “This is the right thing to do for the environment in this
era of diminishing resources and the right thing to do for
federal taxpayers,” McHugh said.  The projects will be about 10 megawatts in size, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment
Katherine Hammack said during the call. She didn’t say what
renewable sources they would use or when they will be built.  To contact the reporter on this story:
