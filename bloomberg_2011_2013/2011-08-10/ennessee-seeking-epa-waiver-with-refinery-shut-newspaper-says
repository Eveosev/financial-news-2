Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam is
asking the Environmental Protection Agency for a waiver to sell
winter-grade fuel in Shelby County, where  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) â€™s
Memphis refinery remains shut after a fire last week,  the
Commercial Appeal reported .  Haslam, a Republican, and U.S. Rep.  Steve Cohen , a
Democrat, asked the agency to waive summer fuel restrictions to
free up more gasoline supply in the area, the newspaper said,
citing a letter Cohen sent to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
