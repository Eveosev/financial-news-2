Bunge Ltd. (BG) , Argentina’s second-
biggest corn exporter, owes about $100 million in taxes for
fiscal 2006 and 2007, according to a claim by the country’s tax
agency, the company said.  Last month, Bunge received a preliminary income tax audit
report and claim from Argentina’s tax authorities for fiscal
years 2006 and 2007, the  White Plains , New York-based grain
trader said in a  securities filing Aug. 9 .  Argentine tax authorities have inspected several Bunge
locations in the country over the last year related to
allegations and an investigation of  tax evasion .  “While we believe that the allegations and claims against
us are without merit, these matters are at a preliminary stage
and therefore, we are, at this time, unable to predict their
outcome,” the company said in the filing. Susan Burns, a Bunge
spokeswoman, declined to provide further comment today.  The agency claims that Bunge owes “a bit less than $200
million” for 2008 and 2009, which was not included in the audit,
according to a tax agency official who cannot be named under
government policy.  The government previously claimed Bunge owed $250 million
for 2007 through 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
