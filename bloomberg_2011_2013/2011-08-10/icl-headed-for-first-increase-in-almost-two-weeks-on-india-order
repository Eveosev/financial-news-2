Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)  headed for the
first gain in almost two weeks after announcing additional
contracts to sell 415,000 tons of potash to customers in  India 
at a price of $490 a ton.  The shares rose 1.2 percent to 48.55 shekels at 3:07 p.m.
in  Tel Aviv , poised for the first daily increase since July 28.  The company that harvests potash and other minerals from
the  Dead Sea  to make fertilizer signed an eight-month agreement
to supply 1.1 million tons of potash to an Indian customer on
Aug. 7.  “Israel Chemicals has increased market share in India in
the last couple of days,” Jonathan Kreizman, an analyst at the
Tel Aviv-based Clal Finance Batucha Brokerage Ltd., said by
telephone.  Kreizman expects the company to report a “relatively
softer second quarter because of lost shipments from April to
August, but then a stronger second half that reflects the
current agreements.”  ICL, as the company is known, “is almost the only potash
manufacturer making up for the lost four months,” he said.  The Tel Aviv-based company trades at 11.4 times estimated
2011 earnings, compared with an average of 12.8 times for 13
industry peers listed on Bloomberg.  Investors are willing to pay a 34 percent premium for
Israel Chemical earnings compared with the earnings of the
benchmark TA-25 index, down from this year’s high of 46 percent
in February, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
