OMV Petrom SA (SNP)  expects to invest
about 1 billion euros in 2012 depending on  cash flow  and the
price of oil above $80 a barrel, Chief Executive Officer Mariana
Gheorghe said.  The Romanian refinery is considering bank loans to fund
investment if cash flow doesn’t reach expectations because of a
lower price of the commodity, Gheorghe said today in an
interview in Bucharest after the OMV AG unit released earnings
for the first six months of the year. Petrom does not plan a
 bond issue , she said.  Petrom can “easily” increase its gearing ration, which
stands at a low 12 percent, to match the OMV ratio of 30
percent, she said.  OMV Petrom is in talks with government to renew licenses by
mid-September and the company hasn’t received a “credible
offer” for the Arpechim refinery and is pushing ahead with
closure permits, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
