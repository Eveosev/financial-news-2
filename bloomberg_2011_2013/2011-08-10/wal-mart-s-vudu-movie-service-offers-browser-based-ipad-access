Vudu , the Web-based film rental
business owned by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , began offering a
browser-based service that lets customers access movies on  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad.  Customers can search for, select and stream more than
20,000 movies and television shows from the Vudu.com site using
an Internet browser, the Santa Clara, California-based Wal-Mart
unit said in a statement today.  By using the browser, Vudu avoids paying Apple 30 percent
of each sale, Edward Lichty, the company’s general manager, said
in an interview. Customers can add a VUDU icon to their iPad
desktops by clicking the “Add to Home Screen” button when on
the website, he said.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, this year began
enforcing a rule that requires developers to share proceeds when
purchases are made within the applications instead of going to a
website.  Vudu,  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and other movie providers have been
trying to gain market share by emphasizing features not
available on  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) ’s monthly streaming service. Vudu
offers a la carte downloads the same day as DVDs or Blu-ray
discs go into stores. It also offers high-definition films and
stereo soundtracks.  Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings has stayed
away from the pay-per-view market, focusing on unlimited
offerings for a monthly fee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
