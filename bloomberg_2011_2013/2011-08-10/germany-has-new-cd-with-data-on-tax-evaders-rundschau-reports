German authorities are in possession
of another CD with data on “thousands of tax evaders” that are
customers of an unnamed “major” Swiss bank, the  Frankfurter
Rundschau  reported.  The authorities are concerned that an accord to end a
dispute over  tax evasion  between Switzerland and Germany may
mean the data held on the CD is of little value, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
