Mauritius’s stocks index rose the
most in 26 months after the U.S.  Federal Reserve  pledged to keep
interest rates at a record low for two more years, boosting
demand for higher-yielding frontier-market assets.  The 38-member SEMDEX gauge of shares surged 3.4 percent to
1,957.34 at the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis, its biggest
increase since June 2009.  State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) , the
second-biggest lender by market value, led gains, rallying 6.9
percent to 93.50 rupees.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke vowed yesterday to keep
borrowing costs at an all-time low through mid-2013 to revive a
recovery that’s “considerably slower” than expected. European
and Asian stocks extended a rebound from a nine-day, $7.8
trillion rout in global equities.  “The Federal Reserve reassured the market,” Vikash
Tulsidas, manager at Axys Stockbroking Ltd., said by phone from
Port Louis. “The Dow Jones bounced back. Asian stocks rose
today. Mauritius is following the same trend.”  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the country’s largest lender by
market value, advanced 3.6 percent to 172 rupees, the biggest
increase since June 2009.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the Indian
Ocean island nation’s largest leisure operator by revenue, rose
for the first time in 11 days, adding 0.6 percent to 86.5
rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
