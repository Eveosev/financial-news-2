biggest three-day climb since the beginning of the  bull market ,
as energy and financial shares advanced after the U.S. reported
a decline in initial jobless claims.  Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s biggest natural gas producer, gained
5.2 percent after U.S. supplies of the fuel increased less than
analysts had estimated.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  North
America ’s fourth-largest insurer, rallied 4.6 percent after

analyst estimate. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s

week. The index’s 7.4 percent three-day gain was the biggest
since March 2009, when it rebounded from a five-year low.  “Slightly under 400,000 isn’t a good number, but it’s a

oversees about C$300 million ($303 million).  The S&P/TSX decreased 5.8 percent this month through

percent to C$40.94.  Trilogy Energy Corp. (TET) , a western Canadian
natural gas producer, rallied 9.2 percent to C$26.35.  Oil-sands developer  BlackPearl Resources Inc. (PXX)  soared 24

cost forecasts for the company’s Tasiast project in West Africa.  Iamgold Corp. (IMG) , which mines in West Africa,  South America
