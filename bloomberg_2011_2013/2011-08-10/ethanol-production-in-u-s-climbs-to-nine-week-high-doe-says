Ethanol production in the U.S. rose
to 908,000 barrels a day last week, the highest level in nine
weeks, according to an Energy Department report.  Output swelled 3.4 percent, the largest weekly gain since
May 13, to the highest level since June 3. Stockpiles sank 4
percent to 18.2 million barrels, the steepest weekly drop since
July 1 and the lowest level since the week ended Jan. 14, the
report showed. Thatâ€™s enough supply for 20.8 days.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
increased 1.7 percent to a record 5.3 million barrels a day.
Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of
ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 1.1 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $2.503 a gallon at 10:52 a.m. New York time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have gained 13 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
