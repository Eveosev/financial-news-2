South African stocks rose, snapping
the biggest five-day sell-off since November 2008, as commodity
prices rallied after the U.S. Federal Reserve pledged to keep
 interest rates  near zero through mid-2013.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share index closed 267.39 points,
or 0.9 percent, higher at 28,658.57 at 5 p.m. in Johannesburg,
halting a five-day decline. Earlier, the index rose as much as
2.8 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest miner,
surged 3.2 percent to 218.69 rand.  About $7 trillion has been erased from the value of global
equities since July 26 as concern deepened the global economic
recovery was faltering and  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsened.
 South Africa ’s benchmark equity gauge tumbled 9.2 percent to an
11 month low over the previous five days, valuing the gauge at
11 times reported earnings, less than the average 14 times
profit since 2006.  “We are nibbling with care,”  David Shapiro , a director at
Johannesburg-based Sasfin Securities, said by phone. “Global
investors have been absolutely shattered and are still not quite
sure where all this is leading.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
