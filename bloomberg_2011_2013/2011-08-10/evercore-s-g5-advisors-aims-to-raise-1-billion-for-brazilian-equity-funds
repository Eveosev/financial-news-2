Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) ’s joint
venture in Brazil,  G5 Advisors , is aiming to raise more than $1
billion to start three private-equity funds and a commercial
real-estate fund in  Sao Paulo .  “We see investors’ continuing appetite for Brazilian
assets,” Corrado Varoli, G5’s co-founder, said yesterday in an
interview. “Evercore will invest with us in the funds and will
help us to raise money.”  Takeovers of Brazilian companies this year are keeping pace
with 2010’s record volume, with 326 deals totaling $64.4
billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Last year’s total for
the same period was $65.3 billion.  G5 wants to raise about $400 million for an oil and gas
fund, $300 million for investing in power and utility assets and
$200 million for luxury brands, Varoli said. The Sao Paulo-based
mergers and acquisitions advisory boutique is also seeking 400
million reais ($252 million) for a commercial real-estate fund
focusing on shopping centers in  Brazil , he said.  Varoli, 50, a former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
founded G5 in 2007. Evercore, the New York-based investment bank
founded by  Roger Altman , a former deputy secretary of the U.S.
Treasury, bought 50 percent of G5 in 2010 for $20 million in
cash and securities, with the potential of earn-out payments
based on performance through 2013.  Brazil’s Bovespa Index has plunged about 26 percent this
year, lagging behind global shares.  Standard & Poor’s 
unprecedented downgrade of the U.S. credit rating on Aug. 5,
coupled with  Europe ’s debt woes, rattled markets worldwide on
concern a global economic slowdown will deepen.  Brazil Opportunities  “It’s always hard to raise funds and is particularly
harder in this environment, but opportunities in Brazil are
still significant,” Varoli said.  After expanding 7.5 percent last year, Brazil’s gross
domestic product is projected to grow 3.96 percent this year,
according to economists polled by Brazil’s  Central Bank .  G5 operates a 300 million-reais hedge fund. It manages 4
billion reais for private-wealth clients and a 30 million-reais
fund for residential real estate.  Kenny Juarez, an Evercore spokesman, declined to comment on
the fundraising plan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
