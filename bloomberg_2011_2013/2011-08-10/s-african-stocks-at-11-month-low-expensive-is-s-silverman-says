South African equities, which are
trading at the cheapest valuations in more than two years,
remain expensive relative to other markets even as they fell to
an 11-month low this week, according to Investment Solutions.  The Johannesburg-based company, which manages more than 100
billion rand ($13.9 billion), is taking advantage of last year’s
changes to South African foreign-exchange controls that allow
retirement funds to invest as much as 25 percent of their assets
outside of  Africa ’s biggest economy, Glenn Silverman, global
chief investment officer at Investment Solutions, told reporters
in Johannesburg today.  Stocks in Africa’s biggest economy trade at 11.5 times
historic earnings, the lowest since June 2009, even as the
FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share Index fell to 28,391.18 on Aug. 8, the
weakest since September 2010. That compares with 7.86 times
reported profit for  Brazil ’s Bovespa gauge, 10.2 times earnings
for the U.K.’s  FTSE 100 index (UKX)  and 11 times profit for the Stoxx
Europe 600 measure.  “We are giving our managers, even our local managers, much
more discretion to play overseas and to play the rand more,” he
said. “We keep our 25 percent overseas, and it’s not just
protection against the rand.”  The rand has surged 30 percent against the dollar since the
start of 2009, making purchases of foreign assets cheaper for
local fund managers.  U.S. technology companies such  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , which
trades at 9.3 times historic earnings, are more attractive than
South African industrial companies including  Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT) 
which is at 12.8 reported profit.  “It’s just a lot cheaper - 50 percent cheaper in many
cases,” Silverman said.  The rally in equity markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve
pledged to keep  interest rates  near zero through mid-2013 may be
short-lived, with markets entering a “bearish phase,” he said.
“Any bounce over the next week or two or three does not mean we
are out of trouble,” he said. “We will be selling into it
rather than buying into it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
