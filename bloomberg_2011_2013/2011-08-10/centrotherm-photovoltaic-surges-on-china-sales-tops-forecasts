Centrotherm Photovoltaics AG (CTN) , a
German maker of production equipment for the solar industry,
rose the most in almost three years, buoyed by surging sales in
 Asia .  Centrotherm climbed as much as 19 percent in  Frankfurt , the
biggest one-day advance since October 2008, after reporting a 57
percent increase in first-half earnings before interest and
taxes to 53.2 million euros ($77 million). The shares were 12
percent higher at 24.42 euros at 1:20 p.m. local time.  Less than a month after German peer  Roth & Rau AG (R8R)  withdrew
its forecast for the year, Blaubeuren-based Centrotherm said it
benefited from higher sales in  China , where manufacturers seek
to modernize their lines to make high-performance products that
sell better as cell and module prices have fallen.  “Cell makers can only compete if they’re able to reduce
production costs with latest technology, especially as demand is
low,” Thomas Riegler, the company’s chief financial officer,
said in a phone interview today.  Sales increased to 428.6 million euros, up from 278.3
million euros a year earlier, Centrotherm said. The numbers beat
analyst forecasts by Deutsche Bank AG, WestLB AG and Berenberg
Bank. The company confirmed its annual outlook, forecasting an
increase in sales of 11 percent to 14 percent.  “Based on the surprisingly strong first-half numbers, that
seems to be a conservative guidance,” Lars Dannenberg, an
analyst with Berenberg Bank, said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
