Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , the
world’s largest custody bank, plans to cut 1,500 jobs, or 3
percent of the workforce, to curb expense growth.  The New York-based bank will implement an immediate hiring
freeze across much of the company and reduce its use of
temporary workers, consultants and contractors, it said today in
a statement.  “Expenses have been growing unsustainably faster” than
revenue, Robert P. Kelly, BNY Mellon’s chief executive officer,
said in the statement. “We expect our natural turnover and
immediate hiring freeze will reduce the impact on existing
staff” from the job reductions.  Kelly said last month he planned to reduce costs after non-
interest expenses rose 22 percent from a year earlier. At that
time, he said the bank would move people to cheaper locations,
consolidate its real estate holdings and cut its procurement
budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
