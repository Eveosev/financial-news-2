German Deputy Finance Minister
Hartmut Koschyk supports Economy Minister Philipp Roesler’s call

Presse  reported, citing an interview.  Koschyk also called for the introduction of a “debt
limit” among European Union members in order to help to regain
market confidence, the newspaper reported.  The U.S. should also introduce a debt limit policy, the
newspaper cited Koschyk as saying, according to an e-mailed
