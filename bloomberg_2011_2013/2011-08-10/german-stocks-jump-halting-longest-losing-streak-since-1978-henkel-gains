German stocks declined the most
since 2008, tracking losses across  Europe , as utilities and
financial stocks retreated after the cost to insure French
government debt against default climbed to a record.  EON AG,  Germany ’s largest utility, plunged after posting a
plunge in first-half profit.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Commerzbank
AG (CBK) , the country’s two biggest banks, retreated. Henkel AG
climbed after reporting that quarterly profit rose.  The DAX sank 303.66, or 5.1 percent, to 5,613.42 at the
5:30 p.m. close in  Frankfurt  for an 11th day of declines, the
longest losing streak since 1978. The gauge has tumbled 25
percent since this year’s high on May 2 amid concern that the
global economic recovery is stalling as European leaders
struggle to contain the sovereign-debt crisis. The DAX entered a
 bear market  on Aug. 8, joining gauges in  France , Switzerland,
Austria, Spain and Italy. The broader HDAX Index fell 4.8
percent today.  After the close of European markets yesterday, the Federal
Open Market Committee pledged for the first time to keep its
benchmark  interest rate  near zero until at least the middle of
2013 to revive a recovery that’s “considerably slower” than
expected. The U.S. central bank also said it’s “prepared to
employ” additional tools to bolster an economy hobbled by weak
hiring and anemic household spending.  “What’s important is the Fed is preparing a plan to help
the economy,” said Yves Marcais, a sales trader at Global
Equities in Paris. “Something is in the works. Still, there
continues to be a lot of volatility. The market is nervous.”  EON, RWE Tumble  EON sank 11 percent to 13.82 euros. The utility said it
will eliminate more than 10 percent of its workforce and cut
dividend payments after first-half profit plunged because of the
government’s decision to shut down all reactors by 2022.  Adjusted net income, the measure that EON uses to calculate
its dividend, fell to 933 million euros ($1.32 billion) from
3.26 billion euros in 2010, the Dusseldorf-based company said.  RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s second-largest utility, lost 9.7 percent
to 25.95 euros.  Deutsche Bank retreated 7.4 percent to 28.77 euros.
Commerzbank slid 7.7 percent to 1.97 euros. A gauge of bank
shares in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 6.7 percent, the
biggest decline among 19 industry groups.  The cost of insuring the debt of France’s Societe Generale
SA rose to a record 302 basis points, according to CMA prices
for credit-default swaps. The cost to insure French government
debt against default climbed 10 basis points to a record 171
basis points, according to CMA.  Henkel advanced 2.7 percent to 42.67 euros. The maker of
Loctite glues and Persil detergent said second-quarter profit
jumped 34 percent to 366 million euros, surpassing analysts’
estimates, as demand rose in  Asia  and the  Middle East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
