Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s
biggest refiner, posted a lower-than-expected loss after the
government and state-run oil producers increased compensation
for selling fuels below cost.  The loss was 37.2 billion rupees ($823 million) in the
three months ended June 30, compared with 33.9 billion rupees a
year earlier, New Delhi-based Indian Oil said in a stock
exchange filing today. The average estimate of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was a loss of 93 billion rupees. Net sales
rose 29 percent to 921 billion rupees.  Indian Oil and state-run rivals Bharat Petroleum Corp. and
Hindustan Petroleum Corp. may reduce losses from fuel sales as
crude drops following  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the U.S.
credit rating on Aug. 5. Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s
decision in June to raise diesel, kerosene and cooking gas
prices after a year will also lower the subsidy bill.  Indian Oil shares have fallen 4.6 percent this year,
compared with a 16 percent drop in the benchmark Sensitive
Index. The stock fell 3.4 percent to 326.50 rupees at 3:10 p.m.
today in Mumbai trading.  India ’s government asks state refiners to sell fuels below
the cost of production to curb inflation in the world’s second-
fastest growing major economy. They get cash and discounts on
oil as partial compensation.  Crude Prices  Crude in  New York  rose 31 percent to an average of $102.34
a barrel in the three months ended June 30 from a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Higher  oil prices 
prompted the oil ministry to ask the nation’s finance ministry
for 290 billion rupees as compensation for the quarter.  The refiners received 150 billion rupees, or about half the
amount sought, two people with knowledge of the matter said Aug.
3. Indian Oil will account for 82 billion rupees, Finance
Director P.K. Goyal said Aug. 4.  Crude for September delivery advanced as much as $3.17, or
4 percent, to $82.47 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , and was at $81.57 at 4:17 p.m.
Singapore time. The contract yesterday fell $2.01, or 2.5
percent, to $79.30, the lowest settlement since Sept. 29. Prices
are down 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
