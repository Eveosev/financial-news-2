(Corrects headline to show that the index rose the most in
nine months.)  Hong Kong stocks jumped, with the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  posting its biggest gain in nine
months, as exporters and raw material producers rose after the
U.S. Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step of pledging to
keep its benchmark  interest rate  at a record low for two years.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to retailers
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., advanced 2.4 percent. Glencore
International Plc, the world’s largest listed commodity trader,
advanced 5.9 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s No. 1 offshore oil
producer by market value, jumped 6 percent. Zijin Mining Group
Co., China’s biggest gold producer by market value, surged 6.6
percent after saying first-half profit rose.  “The Fed’s statement is positive news for the market in
the short term, as the  Hong Kong  market will be flooded with
liquidity,” said Danny Yan, Hong Kong-based portfolio manager
at Haitong International Asset Management, which oversees $600
million. “But there is no catalyst to break the year’s high and
the market will be volatile in the medium term.” The benchmark
gauge closed at its highest level this year on Jan. 19 at
24,419.62.  The Hang Seng Index gained 2.3 percent to 19,783.67 at the
close, its steepest gain since November 2010. Almost six stocks
advanced for each that fell in the gauge of 46 companies. The
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies listed in
Hong Kong rose 1.5 percent to 10,580.41.  Li & Fung  Li & Fung gained 2.4 percent to HK$12. Techtronic
Industries Co., maker of Ryobi power tools and Hoover vacuum
cleaners, sank added 1.6 percent to HK$6.82.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , the U.K.-based lender that made a fifth
of its revenue in  North America  last year, jumped 3.9 percent to
HK$69 after saying it has agreed to sell its card and retail
services business. Trading of the shares was suspended along
with those of six other companies because the exchange’s news
website may have failed to publish price-sensitive documents due
to a computer glitch.  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. said it adopted a half-
day suspension for companies which announced price-sensitive
information during the lunchtime disclosure window today to give
“sufficient time” for investors to locate the announcements
after the bourse’s website was disrupted.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1
percent today. In New York yesterday, the  S&P 500  rallied 4.7
percent, the biggest advance since March 2009 after the Fed
pledged for the first time to keep its benchmark lending rate at
a record low at least through mid-2013 to revive a recovery it
described as “considerably slower” than anticipated.  Additional Tools  The  Federal Open Market Committee  is “prepared to employ”
additional tools to bolster an economy hobbled by weak hiring
and anemic household spending, it said in a statement. Three
members of the FOMC dissented, preferring to maintain the pledge
to keep rates low for an “extended period.”  The Fed statement came after a two-week global stock rout
wiped off $7.8 trillion in global equity markets as  Standard &
Poor’s  cut the U.S. government’s credit-rating on Aug. 5 by one
level to AA+ in response to the deal that President  Barack Obama 
and lawmakers reached to raise the federal $14.3 trillion debt
limit.  The Hang Seng Index entered a so-called  bear market 
yesterday, tumbling more than 20 percent from its November high,
as concern mounted the global economic slowdown will worsen
after the U.S. credit-rating downgrade, and as a report showed
China’s inflation accelerated and industrial output last month
rose less than estimated. Shares on the index traded at 10.3
times forecast earnings at the last close, compared with 11.8
times for the S&P 500.  Oil Prices  Glencore International advanced 5.9 percent to HK$49.40.
Cnooc gained 6 percent to HK$14.52. PetroChina Co.,  Asia ’s
biggest company by market value, rose 3 percent to HK$9.53.
Jiangxi Copper increased 0.7 percent to HK$22.95.  Crude oil for September delivery advanced as much as 4
percent in  New York  today as investors bet fuel demand will
increase amid shrinking stockpiles. Copper futures for September
delivery also climbed.  Zijin Mining surged 6.6 percent to HK$3.71 after saying
first-half net income rose 25 percent from a year earlier to
3.15 billion yuan ($491 million), beating the 2.8 billion yuan
average estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 1.6 percent to 19,726.
The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong Kong
stock options, sank 18 percent to 42.71, indicating options
traders expect a swing of 12 percent in the Hang Seng Index in
the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
