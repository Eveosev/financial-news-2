South Africa â€™s gold stocks index
surged the most since October 2009 as the metal rallied to a
record for a third straight day.  The FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining gauge rose 6.4 percent to
2,671.87 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  AngloGold Ashanti
Ltd. (ANG) , the third-biggest producer of the metal, jumped 8.2
percent to 318.96 rand. the biggest increase since May 2009.
 Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the fourth-largest, advanced 6.5 percent to
112.50 rand.  Gold futures for December delivery climbed $35.50, or 2
percent, to $1,778.50 an ounce at 10:53 a.m. on the Comex in  New
York , after reaching $1,782.90, the highest ever, as the  Federal
Reserve  pledged to keep U.S. interest rates at historic lows
until at least mid-2013, boosting demand for the metal as an
alternative asset.  To contact the reporter on this story:
