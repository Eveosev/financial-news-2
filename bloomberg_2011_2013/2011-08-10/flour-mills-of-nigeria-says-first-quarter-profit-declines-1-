Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (FLOURMIL) , which
processes grains and imports cement, said profit declined 30
percent in the first quarter.  Net income retreated to 2.28 billion naira ($14.9 million)
in the three months through June compared with 3.27 billion
naira a year earlier, it said in a statement published on the
Lagos-based Nigerian Stock Exchange’s website today. Revenue
advanced to 45.9 billion naira from 43.5 billion naira.  Wheat prices increased 9 percent in the year through June.
This curbed profit, Esili Eigbe, a Lagos-based analyst with
Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, said by phone today. “We are still
bullish on the company,” he said.  Flour Mills’ revenue was line with Vetiva Capital
Management Ltd.’s expectations, while profit missed estimates,
Adedoyin Adelakun, a consumer-goods analyst at the Lagos-based
company, said by phone.  “We expected a conservative 3 percent improvement” in
first-quarter profit, she said, adding the company’s “buy”
rating is under review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
