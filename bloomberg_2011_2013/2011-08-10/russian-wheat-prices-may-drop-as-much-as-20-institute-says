Russian milling wheat of export
quality may fall as much as 20 percent in the current season on
the country’s domestic market, according to the Institute for
Agricultural Market Studies.  Average farm-gate prices are set to drop to between 4,700
rubles ($160) and 5,000 rubles a metric ton from 5,660 rubles to
6,250 rubles now, Oleg Sukhanov, grain analyst at the Moscow-
based institute, told Bloomberg yesterday in Rostov-on-Don in
southern  Russia . Feed wheat may fall below the cost of
production, which is under 3,000 rubles a ton, he said.  Russian wheat is now quoted at $260 to $280 a ton on a
free-on-board basis in the port of Novorossiysk, according to
the analyst. That’s composed of current farm prices plus as much
as 1,200 rubles in costs for transportation to port silos and
about 800 rubles for transloading at grain terminals, Sukhanov
said.  Ikar, as the institute is known, raised its estimate for
the current period’s grain crop to as much as 92 million tons
from 89.5 million tons, Sukhanov said. Last year’s harvest came
to 60.9 million tons after Russia’s worst drought in at least
half a century devastated fields.  The new crop will include between 56 million and 57 million
tons of wheat, 16 million tons of barley and 5 million tons of
corn, according to Ikar estimates cited by Sukhanov. It also
will include 14 million to 15 million tons of secondary cereals
such as buckwheat and oats and other grains, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
