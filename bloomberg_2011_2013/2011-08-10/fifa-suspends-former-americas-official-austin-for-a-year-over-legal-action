FIFA suspended Lisle Austin, the
former acting president of Concacaf, for one year after he took
legal action over his suspension as head of the regional soccer
organization.  Austin took over as interim president of Concacaf, which
runs soccer in North and Central America and the Caribbean, when
 Jack Warner  was suspended in May by FIFA over bribery
allegations. He was banned on June 2 by the ruling body after he
fired General Secretary Chuck Blazer, who made the initial
bribery allegation against Warner.  Austin then took the case to court in the Bahamas, in
violation of FIFA rules. FIFA also said if the legal claim isnâ€™t
withdrawn, Austin will remain suspended after the one-year ban
until he does.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
