Las Vegas  Strip casino gambling
surged 32 percent in June as a recovery in the biggest U.S.
betting city strengthened.  Strip betting revenue rose to $506.7 million,  Nevadaâ€™s
Gaming Control Board  said today in an emailed statement.
Gambling climbed 8.5 percent in the first six months of 2011
from a year earlier.  Las Vegas is staging a broad-based recovery from its
steepest gambling and convention decline,  MGM Resorts
International (MGM)  and Caesars Entertainment Corp., the two biggest
casino operators on the Strip, said this week. Room rates have
increased at most resorts and visitors are spending more on food
and entertainment as tourists and conventions return.  Executives at  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  and  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) 
have also said business in their home city is strengthening.  Revenue for all  Nevada  casinos jumped 16 percent to $885.7
million in June, the board said. Monthly proceeds for  Clark
County , which includes downtown Las Vegas as well as the Strip,
rose 20 percent to $767.7 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
