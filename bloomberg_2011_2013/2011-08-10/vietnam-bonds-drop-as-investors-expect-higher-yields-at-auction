Vietnam ’s three-year bonds declined
on speculation the government will increase yields at a debt
auction tomorrow. The dong gained.  The State Treasury plans to sell 1 trillion dong ($48
million) each of three- and five-year notes, according to a
statement filed on the website of the Hanoi Stock Exchange,
where the auction will take place.  “Expected yields range from 12.5 percent to 12.6
percent,” Luu Hai Yen, an analyst at Hanoi-based Thang Long
Securities Joint-Stock Co. wrote in a research note today. “The
rise in yields in the primary market will cause those in the
secondary market to go up.”  The yield on the notes climbed one basis point to 12.46
percent, according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled
by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The treasury sold 150 billion dong of three- and five-year
bonds at the most recent auction on Aug. 4 at a coupon as high
as 12.5 percent, according to the Hanoi exchange.  The dong traded at 20,797 per dollar as of 4:23 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,808 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set the dong-dollar  reference
rate  at 20,618 after keeping it at 20,608 since July 11,
according to its website. The dong is allowed to trade up to 1
percent on either side of the reference rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editor: Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
