Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state-run utility known as Taqa, said second-quarter profit more
than doubled as oil and gas sales increased.  Taqa shares rallied 6.8 percent, poised for the biggest
gain since December 2009, after the company said net income rose
to 435 million dirhams ($118 million) from 171 million dirhams a
year before. Sales increased 38 percent to 7.07 billion dirhams
as revenue from oil and gas advanced 45 percent to 2.73 billion
dirhams, Taqa said in a  statement  on the  Abu Dhabi  bourse.  “During the quarter, steady production in our oil and gas
business has enabled Taqa to capture the benefits of a higher
commodity price environment, while carefully controlling
operational expenditure,” Chief Financial Officer Stephen Kersley said in the statement. “This was supported by higher
contributions from the power and water business.”  Taqa, which owns stakes in oil, gas and power assets in the
 Middle East ,  North America , the  North Sea  and India, benefited
from a 47 percent gain in  oil prices  to an average of $116.99 a
barrel for Brent crude futures in the second quarter. Oil and
gas output from its North Sea fields increased, taking total
production to 135,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent. Output
will stay in the range of 135,000 to 146,000 barrels a day for
the rest of the year, General Manager Carl Sheldon said on a
call with reporters today.  Power Capacity  The company reported a 13 percent gain in power and water
sales to 1.8 billion dirhams as a 2,000-megawatt plant in
Fujairah in the  United Arab Emirates  started operations in
January. Total power generation capacity rose 10 percent to
16,334 megawatts, making Taqa the sixth-largest global
independent power producer, it said.  The shares gained as much as 8 fils to 1.25 dirhams, and
traded 2.6 percent higher at 1.2 dirhams at 11:24 a.m. in Abu
Dhabi. The stock has lost 19 percent this year, compared with a
4.4 percent decline in the benchmark ADX General Index.  The company is “looking extensively” at the ringgit
market for a potential bond sale, Kersley said on the call. The
company plans to invest $2 billion every year through 2013 and
has no need to refinance until October 2012, he said. Taqa spent
$920 million in the first half of the year, he said.  Taqa’s Bergermeer underground gas storage project in the
Netherlands has been temporarily suspended by the Dutch Council
of State pending a review of objections by parties including
local authorities, it said Aug. 8. It signed an agreement in
Jyoti Structures Ltd. in  India  on July 21 to double its existing
250-megawatt plant in Neyveli, the statement today said.  Sheldon is overseeing operations after Abdulla Saif Al Nuaimi left his position as chief executive officer, the company
said in June. Taqa hired Kersley, former vice president of
finance at Royal Dutch Shell Plc, as chief financial officer,
replacing Doug Fraser.  Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority owns 51 percent
of Taqa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
