Port & Free Zone World FZE, the
holding company for Dubai-based ports operator  DP World Ltd. (DPW) , is
raising $850 million from a syndicated loan to refinance debt,
three bankers familiar with the plan said.  The five-year loan has conventional and Islamic portions
and pays a margin of 350 basis points, or 3.5 percentage points,
over benchmark rates, one of the bankers said. The payment rises
to about 375 basis points after including fees, he said. The
loans are backed by shares of DP World, the world’s fourth-
biggest port operator, the bankers said.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  are managing the conventional loan, two of
the three bankers said. Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC, the United Arab
Emirates’ biggest bank complying with Shariah-compliant banking
rules, is managing the Islamic portion, they said.  A spokeswoman for Dubai World, Port & Free Zone’s parent,
declined to comment. Officials at HSBC,  Standard Chartered ,
Citigroup and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. They didn’t
wish to be identified because of company policies. A spokesman
for Dubai Islamic Bank didn’t immediately comment.  Port & Free Zone controls DP World and Economic Zones
World, which owns Jebel Ali Free Zone, the business park in
Dubai adjoining DP World’s flagship Jebel Ali port. The company
raised an $853 million and a 551 million-dirham conventional
loan in 2008 which matures in September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
