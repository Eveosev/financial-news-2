A group of minority shareholders in
BP Plc’s Russian venture said they are suing the U.K. company
for 87 billion rubles ($3 billion) for damages they allege
resulted from the collapse of its alliance with OAO Rosneft.  OAO  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP) , the traded unit of the venture, could
have gained profits of that magnitude from the growth in
Rosneft’s share value if the company had been allowed to replace
BP in a deal to swap shares and explore the Arctic with Rosneft,
the group led by Andrei Prokhorov said today in an e-mailed
statement.  BP’s plan for a $7.8 billion share swap and exploration
alliance with Russia’s biggest oil explorer collapsed after its
billionaire partners in TNK-BP blocked the deal in a Stockholm
tribunal, claiming it violated a shareholders’ agreement. BP’s
directors on the TNK-BP board voted down a proposal to allow the
U.K. company to be replaced, TNK-BP said March 12.  The shareholders’ claim has been filed to Tyumen
arbitration court in Siberia and hearings will take place Sept.
21 and Oct. 12,  court filings  show. TNK-BP spokesman Dmitry
Sergeev declined to comment on the suit when reached by phone.  “We do not believe there is any legitimate basis
whatsoever for such a claim,” BP spokesman  Toby Odone  said in
an e-mail. “If any such claim is advanced against BP or the
directors of TNK-BP Holding, these will be vigorously
defended.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
