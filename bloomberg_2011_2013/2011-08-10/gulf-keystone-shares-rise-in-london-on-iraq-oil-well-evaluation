Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP) , the
U.K. oil explorer focusing on  Iraq , advanced in London trading
after an evaluation of its Sheikh Adi-1 well indicated 1 billion
to 3 billion barrels of gross oil in place.  Gulf Keystone climbed 5.7 percent to 120 pence by the 4:30
p.m. close in London. The evaluation, carried out by Houston-
based  Dynamic Global Advisors , assessed wireline logging data,
core samples, and seismic and regional data, the explorer said
in a statement today. There’s a 50 percent probability that the
field contains 1.9 billion barrels of oil, the company said.  The Sheikh Adi-1 well, drilled to a depth of 3,780 meters
(2.35 miles) is the first exploration well drilled by the
company at the site, it said. The well is west of the company’s
Shaikan block and 80 percent owned by Gulf Keystone, with the
balance held by the Kurdistan regional government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
