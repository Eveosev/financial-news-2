Italian two-year notes opened lower
and the additional yield investors demand to hold Italian and
Spanish 10-year bonds instead of benchmark German bunds widened.  The yield on two-year Italian notes jumped 20 basis points
to 3.69 percent as of 7:38 a.m. in  London  and the rate on
similar-maturity Spanish securities was little changed at 3.19
percent.  Italian 10-year bond yields were little changed at 5.18
percent. That widened the difference in yield, or spread, with
German bonds by seven basis points to 289 basis points. The
Spanish-German 10-year yield spread increaesd six basis points
to 278 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
