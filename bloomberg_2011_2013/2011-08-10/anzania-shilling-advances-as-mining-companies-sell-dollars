Tanzania’s shilling rebounded
against the dollar as mining companies sold the U.S. currency.  The currency of East  Africa ’s second-biggest economy gained
as much as 1.1 percent to 1,599.75 per dollar and traded at
1,618 by 4:51 p.m. in the commercial capital,  Dar es Salaam .  “There was supply of dollars from the mining sector which
caused the slight gain of the shilling,” Zainul Chandoo, head
of Treasury at Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said
by phone from Dar es Salaam. “On the whole, the market is
having normal outflows and inflows.”  Tanzania vies with  Mali  to be Africa’s third-biggest
producer of gold, and has the world’s only known deposits of
tanzanite, a rare gem. The country’s inflation rate climbed to
10.9 percent in June, the fastest pace in 14 months, on higher
energy and food costs, the National Bureau of Statistics said on
July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
