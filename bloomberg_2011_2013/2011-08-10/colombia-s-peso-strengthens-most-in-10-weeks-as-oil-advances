Colombia ’s peso advanced the most in
10 weeks following gains in oil, the South American nation’s
biggest export, and as the country’s growing economy and
controlled inflation boosted appetite for bonds.  The peso strengthened 0.9 percent to 1,795.97 per dollar at
2:12 p.m. New York time, from 1,811.90 yesterday. The advance is
the biggest since May 31.  “While we’ve had a difficult few weeks in global markets,
Colombia’s fundamentals in terms of growth and stable inflation
are boosting the appeal of its bonds and leading traders to bet
on a relatively stable peso,” said Felipe Campos, head analyst
at Alianza Valores SA brokerage in Bogota. “Commodities are
sought as refuge in moments of crisis and that should also help
commodity currencies such as the peso.”  Oil rose from a 10-month low in  New York  amid speculation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve will implement a third round of
asset purchases to bolster the economy and on signs that U.S.
crude supplies are shrinking. Crude accounts for about 40
percent of Colombia’s exports. Colombia also exports coal, gold
and coffee.  Colombia’s economy will grow about 6 percent this year,
Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry has said. Annual
inflation was 3.42 percent in July, within the central bank’s 2
percent to 4 percent 2011 target.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.48
percent, according to data compiled by the nation’s stock
exchange. The yield has fallen 16 basis points so far this
month. The bond’s price rose 0.826 centavo today to 120.439
centavos per peso.  Colombia’s borrowing costs fell today at an auction of
fixed-rate peso bonds, known as TES.  Peso bonds due July 2024 were sold to yield 7.49 percent,
lower than the 7.68 percent at the last auction on July 27, the
 Finance Ministry  said in a statement. Colombia also auctioned
bonds due October 2018 to yield 7 percent, and October 2015
securities to yield 6.45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
