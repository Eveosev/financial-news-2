OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel rebounded,
advancing for the first time in seven days after  Russia ’s
biggest miner said its board will discuss a new share buyback
program at a meeting on Aug. 15.  The shares added 1.6 percent to 6,603 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow.  The buyback price will take into account the last buyout
offer to United Co. Rusal, according to a statement on Norilsk’s
website today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
