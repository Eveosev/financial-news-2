Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and  BNP
Paribas (BNP)  SA options prices rose to the highest level since at
least 2005 and Societe Generale SA’s reached a two-year high as
the cost of insuring French government bonds increased. The
shares plunged.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for at-
the-money BNP options expiring in 30 days jumped to 129.44 as of
5 p.m. in Paris, triple the 40.24 average over the past four
years.  Credit Agricole ’s surged to 194.23. SocGen’s rose to
100.35, the highest since March 2009, as the lender’s stock had
a record decline and led a drop in French banking shares.  Societe Generale SA, Credit Agricole SA and BNP Paribas SA
slumped more than 9.9 percent, leading France’s CAC 40 Index
down 4.5 percent to 3,032.28 at 5:01 p.m. in Paris.  Societe Generale (GLE)  plunged a record 15 percent to 22.08
euros, while Credit Agricole tumbled 14 percent to 5.92 euros,
