SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , Asia’s biggest
casino company by sales, said first-half profit climbed 70
percent on a jump in revenue at its VIP tables and at its
flagship Casino Grand Lisboa.  Net income rose to HK$2.67 billion ($342 million) from
HK$1.57 billion a year earlier, the company said in a filing to
 Hong Kong ’s stock exchange yesterday. Revenue rose 42 percent to
HK$37.8 billion. The company said it will pay an interim
dividend of 8 Hong Kong cents a share on Sept. 21.  SJM is riding the city’s casino revenue, which surged 58
percent last year to 188.3 billion patacas ($23.4 billion),
about four times that of the  Las Vegas Strip . Sales of Macau’s
casino operators, which are benefiting from growing visitor
arrivals from mainland  China , will increase 35.3 percent this
year and 24.7 percent in 2012, CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets
estimated in a July 22 report.  “Even though SJM’s market share may keep falling, they can
still sustain their growth because they depend on junkets for
growth, not new casino openings,” Kenny Tang, Hong Kong-based
general manager of AMTD Financial Planning Ltd., said before the
earnings announcement. SJM has a long history in Macau and
doesn’t need to depend on “novelty” to win customers, he said.  SJM said its share of Macau casino revenue declined to 31.1
percent in the first half from 31.8 percent in the year-earlier
period.  VIP Tables  SJM’s VIP gambling revenue jumped 51 percent first half
from the year-earlier period to HK$26.6 billion as it added
tables. Revenue at Casino Grand Lisboa increased 64 percent and
profit gained 56 percent, according to the statement.  SJM rival  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) ’s market share
rose to about 17 percent after the May 15 opening of the Galaxy
Macau, the only new addition to the city’s casinos this year,
Chairman Lui Che-woo said in June.  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , owned by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson ,
plans to open the first phase of a project early next year on
the Cotai Strip, where it also built the Venetian Macao.  SJM said it will face “new competition” this year and
next with new casinos opening on the Cotai Strip while it waits
for two government land parcels. The two new projects will
probably increase the number of gaming tables to the 5,500
limit set by the government, the company said.  SJM, at the heart of a ownership dispute earlier this year
between billionaire founder  Stanley Ho  and his family members,
has gained 47 percent in Hong Kong this year, compared with the
14 percent slide in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index . The stock
rose 1.5 percent to HK$18.16 yesterday, before the earnings
announcement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
