European stocks fell to a two-year
low amid speculation the region’s debt crisis is spreading and
as the  Federal Reserve ’s plan to hold interest rates failed to
ease concern that the economic recovery is stalling.  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA,  France ’s second-biggest lender,
plunged 15 percent as a measure of banks tumbled the most in two
years. Kloeckner & Co. SE sank 26 percent as earnings trailed
projections. EON AG plummeted the most on record, dragging
 Germany ’s DAX Index down the most since 2008, as the nation’s
largest utility said it will eliminate more than 10 percent of
its workforce and cut dividends.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 3.8 percent to
223.5 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , erasing an earlier
advance of 2.2 percent. The measure entered a  bear market  on
Aug. 8 and has declined 23 percent from this year’s high on Feb.
17 on concern that  Europe  will fail to contain its sovereign-
debt crisis and that the U.S. economic recovery is faltering.  “I am not convinced that what the Fed said will help the
market hugely in the medium-to-long term,” said Markus Huber,
head of German sales trading at ETX Capital in London. “More
details would be needed on what exactly the Fed is planning to
do in case growth continues to slow even more severely.”  After the close of European markets yesterday, the Fed
pledged to keep its benchmark  interest rate  at a record low at
least through mid-2013 to revive a recovery that’s
“considerably slower” than anticipated. The U.S. central bank
said it’s “prepared to employ” additional tools to bolster an
economy hobbled by weak hiring and anemic household spending.  Cheapest Since 2008  A 16 percent retreat since the beginning of the month has
left the Stoxx 600 trading at 10.9 times the reported earnings
of its companies, near the cheapest since 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes fell all of the 18 western
European markets today, except Iceland. The U.K.’s FTSE 100
Index lost 3.1 percent and Germany’s DAX plunged 5.1 percent.  France’s CAC 40 Index slid 5.5 percent, the biggest drop
since December 2008.  Standard & Poor’s , Moody’s Investors
Service and Fitch Ratings affirmed the nation’s top credit grade
as yields on the nation’s debt climbed on concern that Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis is intensifying.  Banks retreated 6.7 percent, the most since March 2009.
Societe Generale lost 15 percent to 22.18 euros, the biggest
drop since October 2008.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, France’s largest
lender, sank 9.5 percent to 35.61 euros and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
plummeted 12 percent to 6.07 euros, a record low.  SocGen Warning  “Societe Generale issued a warning recently, which makes
it very vulnerable to market rumors and that’s why the stock is
getting hit today,” said ETX Capital’s Huber. The French bank
said on Aug. 3 that it may miss its 2012 earnings target after
second-quarter profit fell 31 percent because of a writedown on
Greek government debt.  Societe Generale “categorically denies all market
rumors,” Emmanuelle Renaudat, a spokeswoman for the bank said.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,  Spain ’s largest lender, declined 8.3
percent to 5.82 euros.  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest bank, fell
9.4 percent to 96.7 cents, while  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , the
second-largest, slumped 14 percent to 1.13 euros.  Kloeckner led declining shares in the Stoxx 600 after
reporting second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization of 62 million euros, missing
analyst estimates of 87.2 million euros. The stock plunged 26
percent to 9.59 euros, the biggest drop on record.  EON, Adecco  EON tumbled 11 percent to 13.82 euros, the largest decline
since at least 1992. The utility said it will eliminate more
than 10 percent of its workforce and cut dividend payments after
first-half profit plunged because of Germany’s decision to shut
down all reactors by 2022.  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s largest supplier of temporary
workers, slumped 11 percent to 34.5 Swiss francs as the company
said it would focus on cost control even after second-quarter
net income rose to 141 million euros ($200 million) from 97
million euros a year earlier.  Standard Life Plc (SL/)  surged 5.7 percent to 184.1 pence, the
biggest gain in more than two years.  Scotland ’s largest insurer
said operating profit was 262 million pounds ($426 million) for
the six months to June 30, compared with 182 million pounds a
year earlier. That beat the 193.5 million-pound estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  CSM (CSM)  Climbs  CSM NV increased 5.3 percent to 16.83 euros, the largest
gain since November. The world’s biggest maker of bakery
ingredients repeated its forecast second-half earnings before
interest, taxes before one-time costs and at constant currencies
to be broadly in line with a year earlier.  Subsea 7 SA gained 2.3 percent to 114.4 kroner, the largest
advance since June, as the oilfield-services supplier reported
second-quarter net income of $118 million, compared with $54
million a year prior. Analysts had forecast profit of $93
million, according to 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Dragon Oil Plc (DGO)  soared 5.6 percent to 454.25 pence, the
largest advance in a month. The Caspian Sea oil explorer with
about $1.5 billion in cash said the time is right to consider
acquisitions given the recent drop in stock markets, according
to Chief Executive Officer Abdul Jaleel Al Khalifa. First-half
earnings more than doubled to $309.4 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
