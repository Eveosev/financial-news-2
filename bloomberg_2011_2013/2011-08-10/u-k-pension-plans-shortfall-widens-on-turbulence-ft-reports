The shortfall in underfunded U.K.
pension plans widened by about 50 percent in July as a result of
volatility in securities markets, the Financial Times reported,
citing the Pension Protection Fund’s 7800 Index, which measures
plans’ aggregate assets and liabilities.  The shortfall rose from 77.6 billion pounds ($126 billion)
to 116.7 billion pounds by the end of the month, the newspaper
said.  That deterioration reflects the fact that the FTSE All-
Share Index fell 2.3 percent in July, and 15-year U.K.
government bond yields fell 42 basis points, the FT said.  Bob Scott, a senior partner at Lane, Clark & Peacock, an
actuarial consulting firm, said the overall shortfall of FTSE
100 companies’ pension plans rose from 19 billion pounds to 42
billion pounds between June 30 and Aug. 9, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
