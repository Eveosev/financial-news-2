Oslo police said they reached Utoeya
island as fast as they could to halt last month’s shootings,
responding to a report by broadcaster TV2 they could have flown
a rapid response team out faster.  TV2 reported yesterday that the police could have taken a
Sea King helicopter stationed in Oslo and flown to Utoeya, where
terror suspect Anders Behring Breivik killed 69 people. Using
the helicopter would have taken 10 minutes, compared with the 50
minutes it took by car and boat, TV2 said.  Police were unaware of the helicopter, which had been
requested by health authorities to fly injured people to
hospitals outside of Oslo, Chief of Staff Johan Fredriksen said
today.  “The timeline of eight minutes that was reported yesterday
was totally unrealistic,” Fredriksen said in an interview. “We
believe we chose the fastest method.”  The police’s rapid response team used a car and boat to
reach the island, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Oslo. The
team was on standby in the loaded cars after the bomb attack on
government buildings earlier in the afternoon, he said.  The helicopter may not have been able to land on the island
and police would have still needed boats to cross the water, the
most challenging leg of the journey, Fredriksen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
