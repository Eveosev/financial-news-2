Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is being probed about its
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the firm
said in a filing yesterday.  The bank and some of its units are subject to a number of
probes and reviews, some of which also involve other firms,
according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Goldman Sachs officials in  London  couldn’t immediately comment.  Regulators are probing Goldman Sachs’s dealings with the
Libyan Investment Authority, the Wall Street Journal reported
today, citing people familiar with the investigation.  The SEC opened an investigation in January into whether
banks,  hedge funds  and private-equity firms paid placement
agents to win access to the government-run funds, people
familiar with the matter said at the time.  An agent working with a sovereign wealth fund may be
considered a government official, making interactions with that
person subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which
forbids U.S. companies from paying bribes to officials of
overseas governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
