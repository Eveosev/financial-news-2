First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the worldâ€™s
biggest maker of thin-film solar modules, surged 5.6 percent
after U.S. Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  approved construction
of its 550-megawatt Desert Sunlight power plant project.  First Solar rose $5.58 to $105.28 at 2:21 p.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading. The shares, which earlier reached as high
as $107.99, have declined 19 percent this year.  First Solar, of Tempe, Arizona, in June won a $1.88 billion
conditional loan guarantee to build the project on 4,100 acres
of federal lands in the deserts of Southern California, the
Interior Department said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
