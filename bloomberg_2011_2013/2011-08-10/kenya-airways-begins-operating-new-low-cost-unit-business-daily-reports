Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, started a low-cost unit known as
Jambo Jet, Business Daily reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Titus Naikuni.  The new service will mostly operate Kenya Airways’ regional
routes in eastern Africa, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.
Jambo Jet was formed seven years after Kenya Airways merged its
operations with a previous low-cost unit known as Flamingo
Airlines, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
