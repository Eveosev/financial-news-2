Syria  will increase the retail price
of fuel oil by 53 percent starting Sept. 15 to limit smuggling,
the state-owned  Thawra  newspaper said.  The Arab country will sell fuel oil at 13,000 Syrian pounds
($275) a metric ton, up from 8,500 pounds currently, to reduce
illicit selling of the subsidized fuel that can also be bought
at global prices on the local market, it said, citing Abdullah
Al-Khattab, general manager of the state-owned Syrian Co. for
the Storage and Distribution of Petroleum Products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
