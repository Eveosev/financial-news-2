The  National Labor Relations Board 
ordered a rerun union election among 43,000 Kaiser Permanente
health-care workers in  California  after throwing out results of
a 2010 tainted by allegations of improper conduct.  The Kaiser employees in 2010 voted to remain with the
United Healthcare Workers, an affiliate of the  Service Employees
International Union , rejecting the  National Union of Healthcare
Workers  that broke away from SEIU in 2009. The October 2010 vote
was the largest mail-in election for the NLRB.  The National Union of Healthcare Workers filed a complaint
alleging improper election conduct, leading to an investigation
by an administrative law judge, according to the boardâ€™s
statement. The 2.2 million-member  Service Employees
International Union  is the fastest-growing U.S. labor union.  A new election, which may be scheduled within months, will
force the SEIU to again face the breakaway union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
