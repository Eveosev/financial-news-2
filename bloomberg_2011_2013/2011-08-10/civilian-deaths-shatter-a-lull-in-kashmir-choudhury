The uneasy peace in  Jammu and Kashmir , India's northernmost state and its only Muslim-majority one, was broken this month by two separate killings of civilians by security forces. The state, which borders both Pakistan and  China , has been a tinderbox since India and Pakistan became independent in 1947. It contains the strife-torn Kashmir Valley, which is administered by India and claimed by Pakistan, and has been the target of repeated incursions by Pakistani militants for over two decades. It also hosts a powerful indigenous movement for independence. The deaths of the civilians were the latest in a long series of  human-rights violations  in the state and revived memories of the violence last June that erupted after  a 17-year-old student  was killed by a police tear-gas canister. The event sparked a cycle of  protests  and reprisals that lasted three months and claimed more than 100 lives. One of the civilian deaths occurred in police custody, the other was the result of an "encounter" between the police and an alleged militant. They happened even as Indian forces engaged in skirmishes with militants in the district of  Kupwara  in northern Kashmir. The incidents were indicative of the nightmarish atmosphere that pervades the lives of civilians in the state, where more than 300,000 Indian troops are charged with keeping the peace and flushing out militants.  Nazim Rashid , a shopkeeper in his twenties who also went by the name Anjum, was the first casualty. The incident took place on July 30 in Sopore, 35 kilometers (22 miles) from the state capital Srinagar. NDTV reported : And a few days later  The Telegraph reported  another death: The state's chief minister,  Omar Abdullah  of the Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, was quick to respond to the Sopore killing, saying on his  Twitter page : "The death of Anjum Rashid in police custody is a gross human right (sic) violation & inexcusable. Things like this CANNOT be allowed to happen. He promised  "Swift & exemplary action. No delays, no cover ups, no excuses. " A few days later, NDTV.com reported that  two policemen  had been arrested for their roles in Rashid's death. But Abdullah also inflamed the situation by using the incident as an excuse to  take a swipe  at Mehbooba Mufti, head of the opposition  People's Democratic Party , whose legislators were  pelted with stones  when they visited Rashid's family. But the reality of Kashmir belies Abdullah's avowed intention to change the relationship between the state and its citizenry. In a long and unsettling piece called “Murder By Torture” that described the circumstances of Rashid's death, the journalist Majid Maqbool wrote: The protests against Rashid's death continued for several days across the valley, especially in Srinagar. On Aug. 8, the Kashmir Observer  reported : "Nearly a dozen youth have been arrested by the police over the past four days to quell a fresh wave of stone-pelting in Srinagar. The police has conducted a number of raids to collar youth it says are involved in renewed brick-batting and clashes that have left many injured who, according to authorities, include 23 police and paramilitary personnel wounded last Friday alone." Andin a New Indian Express piece called " Ongoing Saga of Betrayals ," Firdous Syed, who was intriguingly described as "formerly a separatist," wrote: Not all is grim in Kashmir, though. In a piece published on the Reuters Website called " In dark Kashmir valley, a ray of light from India's economic surge ," Sanjeev Miglani described the region’s potential, which he saw firsthand after touring new businesses and meeting with young entrepreneurs in Kashmir: What happens in Kashmir in the days and weeks to come depends on how successfully the government manages to restore public order and regain a semblance of trust. But in the longer run, the state's future depends not just on political solutions but on whether the energies and ambitions of its youth can be channeled productively both by the state and by a more engaged Indian society.
