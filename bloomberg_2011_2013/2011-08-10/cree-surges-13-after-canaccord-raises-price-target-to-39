Cree Inc. (CREE) , a maker of energy-
efficient lighting products, climbed the most in 18 months after
Canaccord Genuity Inc. raised its price target on reduced
concerns about inventories and competition.  Cree rose $4.04, or 14 percent, to $33.53 as of 10:22 a.m.
in Nasdaq Stock Exchange trading. Earlier the shares reached as
high as $34.50, the biggest intra-day gain since January 2010.  Jonathan Dorsheimer, a Canaccord analyst in  Boston , raised
today his 12-month price target to $39 from $37 and upgraded the
shares to “buy” from “hold.”  “Cree has finally begun to work down its inventory
levels,” Dorsheimer said in a note to clients. “We feel the
company has adequately reset expectations while also providing a
path to upside.”  Cree’s fiscal fourth quarter net income dropped 63 percent
to $19.8 million, or 18 cents a share, the Durham, North
Carolina-based company said in a statement after the close of
regular U.S. trading yesterday.  For the first quarter, ending in September, Cree forecast
profit of $16 million to $19 million, or 14 cents to 17 cents a
share, lower than the 18.6-cent average estimate of 10 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Guidance was above what we feel were fairly bearish buy-
side expectations,” Dorsheimer said.  The market for high-powered LED lights may favor technology
leaders in the industry such as Cree, which will give it an
advantage over competitors in  Asia , he said. The company’s
shares have dropped 49 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
