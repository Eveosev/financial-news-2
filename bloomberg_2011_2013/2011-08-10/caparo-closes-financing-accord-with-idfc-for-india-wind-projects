Caparo Energy Ltd. (CEL) , an Indian wind
developer backed by  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , closed financing on 1.5
billion rupees ($33.1 million) with the Infrastructure
Development Finance Co. to help fund its wind plans.  The funding is Caparo’s second tranche of mezzanine finance
after it arranged an initial 3.5 billion rupees in June, the
company said today in a statement.  Today’s tranche has a four-year term and is provided by the
IDFC, an Indian lender to power and road projects. The
financings won’t dilute shareholder equity, according to
Hyderabad-based Caparo.  The 5 billion rupees in funding will enable Caparo to build
about 700 megawatts of wind in India, the world’s third-largest
market for new wind installations behind  China  and the U.S.,
according to the statement.  Caparo, which listed on London’s Aim market in October,
expects to buy back both tranches of mezzanine using internal
cash flow and by issuing senior debt instruments, bonds or other
debt refinancing in three to five years, according to the
statement. Mezzanine finance typically gives the lender the
right to convert into ownership of the company if unpaid.  Caparo also said it has placed purchase orders with  Suzlon
Energy Ltd. (SUEL)  for 260 megawatts of turbines for delivery next
March as part of a January agreement for 1 gigawatt of the
machines signed with India’s biggest turbine producer.  The turbines are for five fully permitted projects in the
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan states, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
