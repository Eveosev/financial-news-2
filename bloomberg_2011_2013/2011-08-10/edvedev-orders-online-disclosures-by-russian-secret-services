Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
ordered the country’s secret services to publish online
disclosures to make their activities more transparent and
accessible for citizens.  The Federal Guard Service, which protects top officials,
the Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, and the ministries of
interior, emergency and defense are among the 19 government
agencies included in a decree signed today, the  Kremlin  said in
an e-mailed statement.  Medvedev, 45, a former lawyer, has revamped legislation
governing the police and forced state officials to declare their
incomes as part of a campaign against corruption.  Russia  was
ranked 154th among 178 countries in Berlin-based Transparency
International’s 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index.  The agencies will now be required to disclose information
about their proposals, activities and anti-corruption efforts as
well as to report incomes and assets of officials and their
families, according to the Kremlin. The Federal Security
Service, the main successor to the KGB, where Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  served as a colonel, is excluded from
presidential orders.  Medvedev, who provides regular updates on his Twitter Inc.
account, has been promoting Internet use in Russia and pushing
the government to move its services online.  To contact the reporter on this story:
