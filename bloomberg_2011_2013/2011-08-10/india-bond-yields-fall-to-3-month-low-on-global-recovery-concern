India ’s bonds rose for the seventh
day, the longest run of gains since 2009, on speculation the
central bank will halt interest-rate increases amid signs the
global economic recovery is stalling.  Yields on 10-year rupee debt fell to a three-month low
after policy makers in the U.S. pledged to keep benchmark
borrowing costs near zero at least through mid-2013 to spur the
world’s largest economy. The  Reserve Bank  of India boosted rates
five times this year to damp inflation that held above 9 percent
for the seventh month in June. Bonds also advanced on optimism a
drop in crude-oil costs will help slow price gains.  “Monetary steps will now depend on overseas
developments,” said Rajeev Radhakrishnan, a Mumbai-based  money
manager  at SBI Funds Management Pvt. “The drop in oil prices is
also a positive for bonds.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage points, to 8.19 percent at the
5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. This is the lowest level since May 6.  The Reserve Bank’s repurchase rate was last raised on July
26 by 50 basis points to 8 percent. Oil prices averaged $87 a
barrel this month compared with $97.34 in July, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
