The value of France’s exports of
agricultural products and food jumped 19 percent in the first
half, boosted by higher wheat prices, the  Agriculture Ministry 
said.  Farm and food exports rose to 27.8 billion euros ($39.4
billion) in the first six months of 2011 from 23.4 billion euros
in the year-earlier period, the ministry said in a  report  on its
website today.  France’s soft-wheat shipments rose to a record in the crop
year ended June, according to crops office FranceAgriMer, after
 Russia  last year banned all grain exports following a drought.
Paris-traded milling-wheat futures climbed 35 percent in the 12
months to the end of June.  In June, “this increase is mainly due to commodity
products,” the ministry said. “Their exports, driven by soft
wheat, to third countries are growing strongly.”  The value of French cereal exports climbed to 4.32 billion
euros in the first half, from 2.69 billion euros a year earlier,
according to the data. Shipments of dairy products and ice cream
rose to 3.04 billion euros from 2.7 billion euros, while wine
and champagne exports were 3.13 billion euros in the six-month
period from 2.71 billion euros a year earlier.  France  imported 22.5 billion euros worth of agricultural
goods and food, compared with 20.3 billion euros in the first
half of 2010, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
