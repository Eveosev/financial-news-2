The U.K. Department of Energy and
Climate Change today approved two biomass power plants that will
produce enough electricity to power about 1 million
homes. The facilities in Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire will
have a capacity of 299 megawatts each, according to an e-mailed
statement from the government that cited Energy Minister  Charles
Hendry â€™s go-ahead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
