MetLife Inc. (MET)  and  Prudential
Financial Inc. (PRU)  led life insurer stocks lower in New York trading
as the market slump increased the burden of equity-based
guarantees to clients.  MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, fell $3.05, or 8.7
percent, to $31.83 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. No. 2 Prudential, based in Newark, New
Jersey, slid $4.81, or 9.2 percent, to $47.77.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has dropped 14 percent in
the last two weeks, pressuring carriers that guarantee minimum
returns on retirement products called variable annuities. A drop
in fixed-income yields to near record lows made it harder to
generate targeted returns on bond portfolios.  “It’s causing the pressure points to all close in on the
companies,” said  Randy Binner , analyst with FBR Capital
Markets, who has an “outperform” rating on MetLife. “Interest
rates are very low, the equity market is trading off.”  Lincoln National Corp. fell $2.07, or 9.1 percent, to
$20.67.  Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG)  dropped $2.01, or 8.3
percent, to $22.16. New York-based MetLife has fallen 28 percent
this year.  Stocks tumbled and U.S. Treasuries rose for a third day
amid concern the European sovereign debt crisis is worsening.
The S&P 500 declined 4.4 percent, while the 10-year U.S.
Treasury yield fell 14 basis points to 2.11 percent after
touching a record low of 2.03 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
