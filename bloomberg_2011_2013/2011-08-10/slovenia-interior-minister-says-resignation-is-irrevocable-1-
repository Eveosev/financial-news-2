Slovenian Interior Minister Katarina Kresal said her resignation is “irrevocable,” a step that may
harm the minority government’s efforts to pass revised budget
spending.  Kresal submitted her resignation to Prime Minister Borut Pahor yesterday and told Slovenia’s Kanal A television today
that the move was final. Pahor, who rejected the resignation
yesterday, released a statement today saying he “respects” the
decision.  Kresal’s resignation comes after Slovenia’s anti-corruption
commission today said it found irregularities in the renting of
a building in the capital, Ljubljana, for one of the ministry’s
agencies. Yesterday, the Audit Court also found irregularities
in the same matter.  Pahor’s administration, which took power in 2008, has 33
lawmakers in the 90-member assembly after two coalition partners
left the ruling group since May. Regular elections are planned
for late 2012. Political analyst Ali Zerdin in Ljubljana said
Kresal’s departure would leave Slovenia with “a non-operative
government” and early election would be unavoidable.  The Slovenian premier needs to revise budget spending at a
time when the euro-region member must pass additional
legislation for the European Union rescue fund to become
operational. Slovenia adopted the euro in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
