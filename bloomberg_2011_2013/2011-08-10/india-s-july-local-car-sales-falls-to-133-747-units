India ’s car sales fell in July from
a year earlier, the first monthly decline since January 2009,
after higher interest rates and production changes at  Maruti
Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  damped deliveries.  Automakers sold 133,747 cars in the country last month, a
16 percent drop from a year earlier, according to data released
by the  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers  in New Delhi
today. The decline in July was the biggest since November 2008.  India’s central bank has raised key interest rates 1.75
percentage points this year to rein in inflation, driving down
demand for cars in a country where about 80 percent of purchases
are funded by loans. Maruti, maker of almost half the cars sold
in  Asia ’s third-biggest economy, said in June it may miss its
forecast of as much as 15 percent sales growth in the year that
started April 1 amid higher borrowing and fuel costs.  “ Interest rates  have gone up and there’s been a fairly
sharp increase in prices of diesel and petrol,”  Vishnu Mathur ,
the group’s director general, said in New Delhi today. “All
these put together have impacted the  market sentiment .”  State-owned Indian Oil Corp., the country’s largest
refiner, increased the price of gasoline by 5 rupees (11 U.S.
cents) a liter to 63.37 rupees in New Delhi in May. That was the
biggest increase since June 2008.  Maruti, Tata Motors  Sales at Maruti, a unit of Suzuki Motor Co. fell for the
second consecutive month in July as the company stopped making
the Swift hatchback ahead of the introduction of a new variant,
and the automaker shifted production of the DZire sedan to
another factory, the New Delhi-based company said last week.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the Indian owner of Jaguar and  Land
Rover , sold 63,761 units in July, a decline of 6 percent, from a
year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said Aug. 1. Local
passenger-vehicle sales fell 38 percent to 17,192 units, while
sales of the Nano, the world’s cheapest car, dropped 64 percent.  Maruti rose 2.9 percent to 1,247 rupees as of 1:57 a.m. in
Mumbai trading. The stock has dropped 12 percent this year,
compared with a 16 percent fall in the benchmark Sensitive
Index. Tata Motors rose as much as 6.5 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Feb. 25, and traded at 840.85 rupees.  Industrywide sales of trucks and buses increased 24 percent
to 64,241 in July, according to the group. Two-wheeler sales
climbed 13 percent to 1.06 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
