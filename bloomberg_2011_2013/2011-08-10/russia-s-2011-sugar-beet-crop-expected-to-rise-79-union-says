Russia ’s sugar beet crop may rise
about 79 percent to 40 million metric tons this year compared
with a year earlier, the country’s Sugar Producers’ Union  said 
on its website today.  Russia harvested about 22.4 million tons of sugar beets
last year, according to the Federal State Statistics Service
data.  Beet refining at sugar plants is ahead of schedule this
year. It began at the end of July in Krasnodar region in the
country’s south, and is expected to start in Central European
Russia in mid-August, the union said.  Russia’s sugar output from beets is seen rising 70 percent
this year to 4.6 million tons, according to the union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
