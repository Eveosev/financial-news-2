Japanese and Australian stock
futures fell as concern Europe will fail to contain its debt
crisis and the yen’s gain toward a record high against the
dollar damped the outlook for exporters’ earnings.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker by market capitalization, dropped 3.2
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. ADRs of  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) , the largest global carmaker by market value,
declined 3.3 percent. Those of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender by market value, fell 3.8 percent.
Those of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, slid
3.6 percent as metal prices slumped in New York and London.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 8,805 in Chicago yesterday, down from 9,020
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,800 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Zealand’s NZX 50 Index, the
first market to open in the Asia-Pacific region today, declined
1.4 percent in Wellington. Futures on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
Index fell 2.4 percent as the costs to protect the government
debt of Greece, Italy, Spain and France rose.  “Investors are continuing to de-risk their portfolios,”
said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “Speculation that France’s
sovereign-debt rating is in the crosshairs of ratings agencies
has served to undermine investor confidence, while the lack of
leadership globally in providing a timely, well-structured
solution to growth and debt woes has created a policy vacuum
during times of great uncertainty.”  Banks Slump  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. In New York yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
closed at its lowest level since September as banks slumped on
concern  Europe  will fail to contain its debt crisis and that the
U.S. economy is faltering.  The S&P 500 fell 4.4 percent in New York after jumping 4.7
percent the previous day as the  Federal Reserve  said it would
keep borrowing costs at an all-time low and was prepared to use
a range of tools to bolster the economy.  Contracts to insure French government debt against default
for five years increased 13 basis points to 174.5 basis points
yesterday, according to data by CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  France’s top credit grade was affirmed by Standard & Poor’s,
Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings as yields on the
nation’s debt climbed on Aug. 9 on concern that Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis is intensifying. France’s 10-year yields
dropped 16 basis points to 3.07 percent.  Debt Crisis  “As Europe’s debt crisis spreads, concern is mounting about
damage to the financial system,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who
oversees about $600 million in  Tokyo  at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “We may slip back into a global equity slump.”  The yen touched 76.35 per dollar yesterday, rising for a
fourth consecutive day, before trading at 76.66 today. The
currency reached a post-war record of 76.25 on March 17. A
stronger yen reduces the value of oversea profits by Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 11 percent this year
through yesterday, matching the drop by the S&P 500 and compared
with a 19 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.3 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 11.3 times for the  S&P 500  and 9.1
times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
