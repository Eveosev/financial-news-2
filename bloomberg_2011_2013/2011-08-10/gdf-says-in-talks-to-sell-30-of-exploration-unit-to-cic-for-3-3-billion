GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA said itâ€™s in advanced,
exclusive talks to sell 30 percent of its production and
exploration activity to China Investment Corporation for 2.3
billion euros.  GDF also said in its first-half earnings statement that its
2011 earnings target excludes the impact of unfavorable weather
in the first half, which it estimates at 465 million euros at
the level of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization.  The target also excludes the risk of a natural gas
distribution price freeze in  France , the company said in an
emailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
