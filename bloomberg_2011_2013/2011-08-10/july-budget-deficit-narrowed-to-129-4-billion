The budget deficit in the U.S.
narrowed in July, reflecting a calendar-related reduction in
spending compared with the same month last year.  The shortfall between revenue and outlays totaled $129.4
billion last month, down from $165 billion in July 2010,
according to the Treasury Department’s monthly budget statement
issued today in Washington. The gap for the fiscal year to date
climbed to $1.1 trillion.  The inability of Congress and the Obama administration to
agree on a long-term plan to tame the fiscal imbalance prompted
 Standard & Poor’s  to cut the nation’s debt rating last week,
contributing to a plunge in global stock markets. A dimming
outlook for growth and employment means the U.S. government will
have even more difficulty closing the shortfall in coming years.  “The jury is out on whether the government can rein in
these deficits in the long run,” said  Chris Rupkey , chief
financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  New
York . “When it comes to fiscal austerity, the U.S. is way
behind most of the rest of the world.”  Stocks dropped on concern the economic recovery was
faltering. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.7 percent to
1,152.62 at 2:19 p.m. in New York.  Treasury securities  rose,
sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down to 2.17
percent from 2.25 percent late yesterday.  Survey Results  The median forecast of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News projected a budget deficit of $133 billion in July.
Forecasts ranged from $125 billion to $140 billion.  The  Congressional Budget Office  projected a shortfall of
$132 billion for July. “Much of that difference occurred
because there were shifts in the timing of certain payments in
2010,” the CBO said on Aug 5. Payments were pushed into July
2010 because Aug. 1 fell on a weekend last year.  As a result, spending by the government fell 10 percent in
July from the same month last year to $288.4 billion.  Revenue and other fees increased 2.3 percent last month to
$159.1 billion. Individual income taxes are up 24 percent so far
this fiscal year to $890.7 billion. Corporate income tax
receipts have climbed 0.6 percent.  The fiscal year to date deficit compares with a $1.17
trillion gap the prior fiscal year, according to the Treasury’s
budget statement.  Projected Deficit  This year’s federal budget deficit is projected to reach
about $1.4 trillion, according to CBO forecasts. That would
match the previous record reached in fiscal 2009. In fiscal year
2010, the shortfall totaled about $1.3 trillion.  In its debt downgrade announcement on Aug. 5, S&P said the
action reflected its “view that the effectiveness, stability,
and predictability of American policy-making and political
institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and
economic challenges.”  The budget agreement between Congress and the White House
cuts $917 billion from spending over the next decade, and
establishes a “super-committee” of House and Senate members
charged with cutting an additional $1.2 trillion. If that panel
failed to reach an agreement, a legislative mechanism would
reduce spending equally in defense and domestic programs.  House Republican leaders have said that they will continue
to resist the president’s calls to increase taxes to close the
deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
