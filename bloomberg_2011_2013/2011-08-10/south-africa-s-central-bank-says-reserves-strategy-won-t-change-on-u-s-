The South African central bank’s
strategy on foreign exchange reserves won’t change because of
U.S. debt being downgraded by  Standard & Poor’s , said Johan van
den Heever, the bank’s deputy chief economist.  The U.S. Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep  interest rates 
low will be an incentive for investors to maintain portfolio
flows into emerging markets economies, Van den Heever told
lawmakers in  Cape Town  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
