India  is seeking to buy 20 percent
to 25 percent of Belaruskali, a  Belarus  potash producer, for as
much as $7 billion to ensure fertilizer supply, New Delhi-based
 Mint  reported, citing two ministry officials it didn’t name.  Russia’s OAO Sberbank has agreed to take 35 percent of
Belaruskali as collateral for a $2 billion loan, it noted,
adding an Indian official for Belaruskali declined to comment.  Manoj Kumar Bharti, India’s ambassador to Belarus, met
Mikhail Myasnikovich, prime minister of the former Soviet state,
to discuss an acquisition on Aug. 4, the news website reported.  Indian Agriculture Minister  Sharad Pawar  made the case for
a deal in a letter to the country’s prime minister, it said.  Anatoly Makhlai, Belaruskali’s spokesman in Minsk, declined
to comment on the report when Bloomberg News called.  To contact the reporter on this story:
