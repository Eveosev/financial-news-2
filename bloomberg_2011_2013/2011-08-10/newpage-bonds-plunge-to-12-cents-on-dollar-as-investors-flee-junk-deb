Bonds of NewPage Corp. fell to the
lowest level since they were issued in 2005 as reduced demand
for high-yield debt punishes companies that need to refinance.  Its $806 million of 10 percent notes due in May 2012 fell
1.9 cents to 12.1 cents on the dollar at 12:04 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Trace, the bond price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The securities, which
are yielding more than 700 percent, have tumbled from 30.6 cents
at the end of June and 70 cents in March, Trace data show.  The coated-paper maker owned by Cerberus Capital Management
LP has been unprofitable since 2006 and needs to refinance more
than $1 billion of notes next year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The extra yield investors demand to own
speculative-grade bonds instead of Treasuries rose yesterday to
719 basis points, or 7.19 percentage points, from 532 basis
points on July 27, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
