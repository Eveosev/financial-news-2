Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) , India’s largest iron-
ore exporter, and Elenilto Minerals & Mining LLC will jointly
invest more than $2.6 billion in Liberia’s Western Cluster Ltd.
as rising demand for the steelmaking ingredient boosts prices.  Elenilto’s share of investment in the  iron-ore  company will
be $77 million, it said yesterday in a statement. The Liberian
government will receive $41 million from the partnership after
ratifying the Mineral Development Agreement, said Elenilto, a
unit of Tel Aviv-based  EngelInvest Group .  Liberia, the West African nation rebuilding its economy
after civil wars between 1989 and 2003, is expanding its iron-
ore industry after an increase in Asian demand pushed prices up
43 percent last year. OAO Severstal is developing the Putu ore
project in the country, while Sable Mining Africa Ltd. said in
June it acquired a stake in the Kpo Range exploration permit.  Sesa Goa, a unit of London-listed  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) ,
said Aug. 7 it would buy 51 percent of Western Cluster for $90
million. Western Cluster plans to develop a project that
includes iron-ore deposits and transport infrastructure to
export the material.  Iron ore with 62 percent iron content arriving at  China ’s
Tianjin Port is trading at $177.80 a metric ton, according to
The Steel Index. Prices have gained 4.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
