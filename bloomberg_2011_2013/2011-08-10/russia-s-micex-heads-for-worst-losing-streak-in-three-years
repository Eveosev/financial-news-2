Russian stocks headed for their
worst losing streak since January 2008 as investors retreated
from riskier emerging markets on fears the global economy is
slowing.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks sliped 0.4 percent to 1,491.2
by 1:44 p.m. in Moscow, erasing an earlier advance of as much as
2.2 percent. That took the gauge’s seven-day retreat to 13.5
percent.  OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest oil producer, lost 1.9
percent. OAO Norilsk Nickel, the country’s biggest miner,
dropped 3 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index traded
little changed at 1,610.54, paring an earlier loss of as much as
2.7 percent.  Russian stocks had rebounded earlier after the U.S. Federal
Reserve pledged to keep  interest rates  at a record low for two
more years. Oil, Russia’s major export revenue earner, advanced
as much as $3.17, or 4 percent, to $82.27 a barrel.  “Volatility is still very high and we are still in de-
risking mode,” Marco Casas, the vice-president of equity sales
at Otkritie Capital, said in e-mailed comments  A rally in Russian stocks may be short-lived after the
benchmark Micex index retreated 20 percent from this year’s
high, signaling a longer-term trend, according to Auerbach
Grayson & Co.  The index’s 14-day relative strength index, or RSI, sank to
21.40 yesterday, below the threshold of 30 that indicates a
rally, according to technical analysts. The last time the RSI
fell that low was on Jan. 23, 2008, when the Micex advanced 25
percent in four months before tumbling as much as 75 percent.  “Deeply oversold RSI readings which occur against the
backdrop of a  bear market  must be viewed differently than those
which occur within the context of a burgeoning bull market,”
 Richard Ross , a New York-based global technical strategist at
Auerbach Grayson, said in e-mailed comments yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
