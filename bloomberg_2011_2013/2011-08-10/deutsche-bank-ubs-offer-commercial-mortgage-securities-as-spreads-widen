Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  UBS AG (UBSN)  are
offering a $1.4 billion commercial-mortgage bond deal at the
highest relative yields since sales of the debt revived in 2009
as  Europe ’s sovereign fiscal crisis roils markets.  The banks are marketing top-rated securities maturing in
about 10 years to yield 215 basis points more than the benchmark
swap rate, according to people familiar with the offering who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t set. That
compares with 170 basis points, or 1.7 percentage points, on
similar debt sold by Wells Fargo & Co. and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in July.  The deal is being sold in the public market as lenders look
to expand the universe of potential buyers after investors
pushed back on deal terms and pricing. Frankfurt-based Deutsche
Bank and Zurich-based UBS are also offering buyers the highest
levels of so-called credit enhancement, which protect AAA
securities from losses, since the market restarted almost two
years ago.  Top-ranked commercial mortgage-backed securities yield 298
basis points more than Treasuries, according to a Barclays Plc
index. The spread jumped 35 basis points last week and is at the
highest level since July 2010.  Wall Street  has arranged more than $22 billion of
commercial-mortgage bonds sales this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with $11.5 billion in all
of 2010, the data show. Sales plummeted in 2008 from a record
$234 billion in 2007, choking off funding to property owners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
