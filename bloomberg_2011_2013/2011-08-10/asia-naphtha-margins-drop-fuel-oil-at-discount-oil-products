Asia naphtha refining margins
declined on signs that demand may slow in  Taiwan . Fuel oil’s
discount to crude widened.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures, or
the crack spread, fell to $98.30 a metric ton at 6 p.m.
 Singapore  time from $109.27 a ton at the end of Asian trading on
Aug. 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  There was no oil trading on the Platts window yesterday in
Singapore because of a public holiday.  Formosa Petrochemical Corp., Taiwan’s only publicly traded
oil refiner, said it is running its No. 2 naphtha cracker at
full capacity as it prepares to close one unit and another
remains shut following a fire.  The No. 3 cracker will stop for maintenance for 40 days
starting Aug. 15, spokesman Lin Keh-yen said today. The No. 1
unit has been halted since a fire in May.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 62 cents to
$5.01 a barrel at 6:34 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. That signals increased
losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  Westport Petroleum Inc. sold 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke
fuel oil to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at $2.75 a ton over benchmark
quotes, according to a Bloomberg News survey. PetroChina Co.
sold a similar cargo to Hin Leong Trading Pte at $619.50 a ton.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
fell to $7.50 a ton from $8.25 a ton on Aug. 8, PVM said. This
viscosity spread is the narrowest since Sept. 29, 2010.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong sold 250,000 barrels of 0.5 percent sulfur
gasoil, or diesel, to Total SA at 35 cents a barrel below August
quotes, according to the Bloomberg News survey. The Singapore
trader was the second-largest gasoil buyer last month,
purchasing at least 3.75 million barrels.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude rose 4
cents to $18.74 a barrel at 6:34 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rose 25 cents to $1.90 a
barrel, PVM said. This regrade climbed the most since July 22,
indicating it is more profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
