Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (APD) , a
U.S. industrial-gas producer, won approval to build a power
plant in northeast  England  that will turn household and
commercial trash into electricity for as many as 50,000 homes.  Air Products received consent from the local council to
build the 49-megawatt power station at a site near Billingham,
the Allentown, Pennsylvania-based company said today in a
statement. The plant may be operational in 2014, subject to
financing, it said.  The U.K. has a binding European Union target to get at
least 15 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2020, a
sevenfold jump from 2008. About 30 percent of that may be met by
 bio-energy , derived from biomass such as wood chips, energy
crops and waste, according to the Department of Energy and
Climate Change.  The so-called advanced gasification plant will cost “many
millions” to build, Ian Williamson, European hydrogen and bio-
energy director at Air Products, said today by e-mail. Air
Products plans five such facilities in the U.K., he said.
They’ll require total investment of about 1 billion pounds ($1.6
billion) and have a combined capacity of about 250 megawatts.  “Energy from waste leads to considerable reductions in
waste going into landfill, and makes an important contribution
to the U.K.’s low-carbon energy supply,”  Greg Barker , U.K.
energy and climate change minister, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
