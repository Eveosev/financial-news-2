Seed Co (SEEDCO)  Ltd., a Zimbabwean company
with operations in several African countries, expects revenue to
increase 25 percent this year, said Chief Executive Officer
Morgan Nzwere.  Profit for the year through March 2012 will probably “grow
exponentially,” Nzwere said at the company’s annual general
meeting in the capital, Harare, today. Net income advanced 30
percent last year to $17.4 million.  Sales will probably increase because of rising prices for
corn, soya and cotton, Nzwere said. Cotton sales are expected to
increase 5 percent this, increasing its contribution to overall
sales to 20 percent this year, he said. Malawi may boost seed
imports by 87 percent to 2,500 metric tons, he said.  “In Malawi, we expect demand to come from the government
and non-governmental organizations,” Nzwere said.  Seed Co, which operates in countries including Swaziland,
Kenya and Zambia, develops and sells corn, soya, wheat, barley,
groundnut and sorghum seeds. The Harare-based company controls
 Aico Africa Ltd. (AICO) , southern Africa’s biggest cotton seed
supplier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
