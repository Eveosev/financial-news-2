Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and Citigroup
Inc. posted new declines as U.S. lenders resumed their slide,
pushed lower by concern about Europe’s debt crisis and a weak
domestic economy.  Citigroup was the worst performer in the 24-company  KBW
Bank Index (BKX) , falling $3.31, or 10 percent, to $28.51 at 10:47
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The index
dropped 6.3 percent with Bank of America, the nation’s largest
lender by assets, declining 8.4 percent, and Regions Financial
Corp., Comerica Inc. and SunTrust Banks Inc. each down more than
8 percent.  Banks had rallied yesterday, regaining some of the ground
lost in Monday’s 11 percent rout, after the  Federal Reserve 
eased concern that the economy might fall back into recession.
Those fears returned at the start of today’s trading, fed by
doubt about  Europe ’s ability to solve its debt crisis.  “People will probably have concluded that despite the
Fed’s comments, the fundamentals haven’t actually changed
compared with two days ago,” said Richard Staite, an analyst at
Atlantic Equities LLC. “The concern is that central banks and
governments are running out of ammunition to stimulate the
economy.”  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke vowed yesterday to
keep borrowing costs at an all-time low to revive a recovery
that’s “considerably slower” than expected.  “There are more uncertainties in Europe still,” Staite
said. “Although banks there have raised a lot of capital, the
overall political uncertainties in Europe still make it a more
risky environment for banks to operate in than in the U.S.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
