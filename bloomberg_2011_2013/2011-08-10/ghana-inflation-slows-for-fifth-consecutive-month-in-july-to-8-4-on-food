Ghana ’s inflation slowed for the
fifth consecutive month in July as the cedi gained and food
prices eased in West Africa’s second-biggest economy.  The inflation rate fell to 8.4 percent from 8.6 percent in
June,  Grace Bediako , a statistician at the Ghana Statistical
Service, told reporters in the capital, Accra, today.  Ghana’s central bank cut its benchmark  interest rate  twice
this year to 12.5 percent as inflation slowed. The cedi gained
0.3 percent in the four months through July 31, lowering import
costs, while the government cut fertilizer costs to farmers,
boosting food supplies.  “Local food disinflation will prove key as it has done in
recent months,” Stephen Bailey-Smith, a London-based emerging
markets strategist at  Standard Bank  Group Ltd., said in an e-
mailed note on Aug. 8. “The bias for monetary policy remains
toward further easing.”  Standard Bank expects the central bank will cut its
benchmark rate by another 50 basis points this year.  Producers’ costs are easing, helping to curb consumer-price
inflation. The cost of goods leaving  Ghana ’s factories, mines
and farms rose 12.2 percent in June from a year ago, almost
halving from 23.2 percent in May, the statistics office said on
July 27.  “The government has invested actively in  food supply ,”
Sampson Akligoh, an economist at Accra-based Databank Financial
Services Ltd., said in a telephone interview before today’s
data. The projects included a program that cut fertilizer prices
for farmers, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
