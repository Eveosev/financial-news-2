Kenya ’s central bank said it has
stopped injecting liquidity into the market, boosting the 
nation’s currency, which gained the most in more than three
years.  The  Central Bank of Kenya  will halt offering reverse-
repurchase agreements, after injecting 100.9 billion shillings
($1.08 billion) into the market through reverse repos between
July 18 and yesterday, a Nairobi-based official, who can’t be
identified because of central bank policy, said by phone today.  In a reverse repurchase agreement the central bank buys
back securities from commercial banks. Lenders in Kenya have had
enough time to adjust their liquidity requirements, the central
bank official said.  Kenya’s shilling strengthened 2.4 percent to 92.85 per
dollar by 2:15 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. A close at this
level will be biggest gain since March 12, 2008. The move pared
losses against the dollar this year to 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
