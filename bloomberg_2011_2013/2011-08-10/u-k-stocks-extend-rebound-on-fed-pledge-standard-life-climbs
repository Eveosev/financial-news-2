U.K. stocks resumed their retreat,
led by a selloff in banks as the cost of insuring French debt
rose to a record, renewing concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis may spread to its larger economies.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) 
paced the declines, losing more than 5 percent in London
trading. Mining shares erased an earlier rally, led by  Kazakhmys
Plc (KAZ)  and  Antofagasta Plc. (ANTO)   Standard Life Plc (SL/)  advanced after the
insurer posted earnings that topped analysts’ estimates.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  tumbled 157.76, or 3.1 percent, to
5,007.16 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, reversing yesterday’s
1.9 percent rally and extending the gauge’s decline from this
year’s high on Feb. 8 to 18 percent. The FTSE All-Share Index
dropped 2.8 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 2.3
percent.  “The market has gone back to focusing on debt,” said
 David Jones , chief market strategist at IG Index in  London .
“There is still that risk of contagion; last week there was
concern about Spain, this week potentially  France .”  Stocks rallied earlier today after the  Federal Reserve 
pledged to keep  interest rates  low until the middle of 2013. The
Fed also said it will use a range of measures to support the
world’s largest economy.  “Yesterday the market was looking for an excuse to rally
and the Fed gave them that excuse,” said Jones. “ It provided
a short bit of relief, but it doesn’t change the bigger
picture.”  RBS, HSBC, Lloyds  RBS paced a selloff in European banks as the cost of
insuring French debt climbed. The shares plunged 7.3 percent to
24.3 pence, while HSBC declined 5.3 percent to 516.2 pence and
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  slid 4 percent to 30.8 pence.  France’s Societe Generale SA plunged 15 percent, while BNP
Paribas tumbled 9.5 percent. Credit-default swaps on French debt
rose to a record 171 basis points, according to CMA.  “If credit-default swaps on France are under attack that’s
not a good sign,” said Yves Marcais, a sales trader at Global
Equities in Paris. “That means that France is under attack and
that’s worrisome. French banks hold a lot of French bonds.”  France’s borrowing costs are climbing as Europe’s debt
crisis makes investors wary of lending to any nation other than
Germany. Investors currently demand about 90 basis points of
extra yield to buy 10-year French debt rather than German bunds,
even though both carry AAA grades from the rating companies.  Mining Companies Retreat  A gauge of mining shares swung to a loss in afternoon
trading as copper erased gains in London, falling as much as 2.1
percent. Kazakhmys dropped 7.7 percent to 918 pence, Antofagasta
lost 5.1 percent to 1,144 pence and Anglo American Plc retreated
4.4 percent to 2,314 pence.  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  fell with oil-related companies, tumbling
13 percent to 262.1 pence as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. removed
the company from its “conviction buy” list.  Cairn Energy Plc lost 4.5 percent to 293.9 pence,  Tullow
Oil Plc (TLW)  lost 2.6 percent to 974 pence and Royal Dutch Shell
Group Plc retreated 2 percent to 1,901 pence.  Standard Life paced advancing shares, jumped 5.7 percent to
184.1 pence after Scotland’s biggest insurer reported a 44
percent increase in first-half operating profit to 262 million
pounds ($424 million) as revenue from fees climbed and inflows
of savings rose. That beat the 193.5 million-pound average of 11
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Man Group Plc (EMG)  gained 3.2 percent to 187.2 pence after the
hedge fund manager’s Chief Executive Officer Peter Clarke and
other directors bought a total of 150,000 shares in the company.
The stock has declined 37 percent so far this year.  Weir Group Plc (WEIR)  rose 1.9 percent to 1,735 pence after
Goldman added the engineering company to its “conviction buy”
list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
