Czech stocks jumped the most in 15
months, rebounding from a two-year low as the  Federal Reserve 
pledged to keep U.S. funding costs at a record low through 2013
and Citigroup Inc. recommended buying  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  shares.  The PX gauge of companies jumped as much as 4.3 percent,
its biggest advance since May 2010, and traded up 3.4 percent to
1,034.6 at 1:43 p.m. in Prague. The gauge fell 15 percent in the
previous six days, the worst slump since February 2009.  European stocks and commodities gained after Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke vowed yesterday to keep near-zero  interest rates 
to protect growth in the world’s largest economy. The  European
Central Bank  bought Spanish and Italian bonds for a third day,
according to four people familiar with the transactions, as
policy makers try to stem the euro region’s debt crisis.  “Emerging-market equities recovered in the wake of
yesterday’s Federal Open Market Committee comment,” strategists
at  RBC Capital Markets  led by Toronto-based  Nick Chamie  wrote in
an e-mailed report to clients today.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and coal company New World Resources
Plc surged by more than 5.7 percent today.  Komercni, a unit of Societe Generale SA, climbed 2.1
percent, rebounding from the lowest close in more than two years
yesterday. Citigroup raised its recommendation on the stock to
“buy” from “hold,” saying a “bear scenario” was already
priced into the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
