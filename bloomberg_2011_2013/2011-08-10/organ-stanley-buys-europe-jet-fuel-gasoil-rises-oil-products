Morgan Stanley bought barge lots of
 jet fuel  in northwest  Europe  for a third day. Gasoil gained for
the first time in nine days on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  Gasoline’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , the region’s
benchmark, narrowed. LyondellBasell Industries NV shut a
gasoline unit at its Berre refinery in the south of  France  after
an “incident” on Aug. 7.  Light Products  Eurobob gasoline for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
traded at $934 to $960 a metric ton, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That
compares with deals from $925 to $954 a ton yesterday.  Gunvor International BV bought 4,000 tons of the 7,000 tons
that changed hands. BP Plc and Total SA were the main sellers.
Ethanol is added to the Eurobob grade to make finished motor
fuel. The trades are typically for 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack shrank to $5.92 a barrel from $6.36
yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and
refined products broker in  London .  Naphtha’s discount to Brent narrowed to $5.76 a barrel from
$5.99 yesterday, according to PVM data.  Middle Distillates  Morgan Stanley purchased 4,000 tons of jet fuel from Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and Statoil ASA at a premium of $71 a ton to
September ICE gasoil, according to a survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window which ends at 4:30
p.m. London time. That compares with yesterday’s deals at $71
and $72 more than August gasoil.  Gasoil for August gained 0.7 percent to $892.75 a ton as of
5:11 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The contract will
expire tomorrow. The more-actively traded September contract
advanced 0.5 percent to $890.25 a ton. Brent for September
surged 2.1 percent to $104.74 a barrel.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profitability,
expanded to $14.83 a barrel at 4:30 p.m. London time from $14.57
yesterday, according to ICE data.  Diesel traded at premiums of $26 and $27 a ton to September
gasoil, according to the survey. Deals were also done at $26
more than August gasoil. Yesterday, the fuel changed hands at
premiums of $23.50 to $26 to August futures.  Residues  High sulfur fuel oil barges traded from $588 to $594 a ton,
according to the survey of Platts. That compares with deals
yesterday from $595 to $599 a ton.  Refineries  LyondellBasell halted a catalytic cracker at its Berre
refinery after the Aug. 7 incident that caused “visible smoke
from the refinery,” the company said. Berre can process 105,000
barrels of crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Saras SpA will idle crude unit RT2 and desulfurization
plants U700 and U500 at its Sarroch refinery in Sardinia for
maintenance in the third quarter, the company said. “Minor
activities” at a catalytic reforming facility and a visbreaker
are planned in the fourth quarter, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
