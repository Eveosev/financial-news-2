Dexia SA (DEXB)  shareholder Holding
Communal SA is set to be granted a maturity extension on 120
million euros ($172 million) of debt by the country’s regional
governments,  L’Echo  reported, without saying where it obtained
the information.  The debt was supposed to be repaid between Aug. 12 and
Sept. 1, the newspaper said. Holding Communal does not have
sufficient liquidity to meet the original payment deadlines,
according to L’Echo. The new maturity date will be Sept. 15, it
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
