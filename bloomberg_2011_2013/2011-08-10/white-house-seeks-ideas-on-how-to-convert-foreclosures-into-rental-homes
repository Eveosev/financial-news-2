The Obama administration is seeking
ideas from investors on how to convert thousands of foreclosed
properties owned by government-backed entities into rental
homes.  The  Federal Housing Finance Agency , the regulator of Fannie
Mae and  Freddie Mac , U.S. Treasury Department and the Department
of Housing and Urban Development announced the solicitation in a
press release today.  The goal is to shrink the pool of foreclosed properties for
sale and boost stagnant  home prices  by finding investors to buy
large pools of foreclosed properties owned by Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, the two government-run mortgage companies that own
or guarantee about half the nation’s mortgages.  “Partnerships involving enterprise properties may reduce
taxpayer losses and meet the enterprises’ responsibility to
bring stability and liquidity to housing markets,” FHFA Acting
Director Edward J. DeMarco said in the press release.  Freddie Mac, of McLean, Virginia, and its larger rival,
Washington-based  Fannie Mae , have survived on government aid
since September 2008, when they were seized amid crippling
losses tied to subprime loans.  The FHFA is pursuing the quest because of expectations that
housing prices will continue to fall if delinquent properties
end in foreclosure, rather than being converted to some type of
income-producing arrangement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
