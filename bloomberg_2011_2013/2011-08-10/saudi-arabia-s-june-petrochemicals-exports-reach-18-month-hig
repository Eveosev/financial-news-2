Saudi Arabia ’s petrochemicals
exports increased 83 percent by value in June from a year
earlier, reaching their highest level in 18 months because of
higher prices and stronger demand from  Asia .  The kingdom, which has the world’s biggest oil reserves,
shipped petrochemicals valued at 5.23 billion riyals ($1.39
billion) up from 2.86 billion riyals a year earlier, according
to data from the Department of Statistics and Information.
Exports rose 9 percent on a month-to-month basis, the department
 reported  on its website today.  Petrochemicals accounted for 37 percent of Saudi Arabia’s
June non-oil exports, with a value of 14.1 billion riyals.
Plastics accounted for 28 percent of the total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
