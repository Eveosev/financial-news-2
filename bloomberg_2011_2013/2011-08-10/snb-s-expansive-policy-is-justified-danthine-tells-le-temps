The Swiss central bank’s current
expansive monetary policy is justified, Swiss National Bank
Governing Board member Jean-Pierre Danthine told  Le Temps 
newspaper in an interview to be published tomorrow.  “An extremely expansive monetary policy is justified to
the extent that there are no inflationary effects on the
horizon” Danthine told the newspaper. “Inflation risks have
practically disappeared. On the contrary, the clouds hanging
over the global economy and the current strength of the Swiss
franc lead to recession risks and negative price pressures.”  The Swiss franc is “massively overvalued”, Danthine told
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
