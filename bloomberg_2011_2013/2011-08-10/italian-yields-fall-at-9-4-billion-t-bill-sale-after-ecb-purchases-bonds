Italy sold 3.75 billion euros ($5.4
billion) of 10-year securities and borrowing costs fell in its
first auction since the  European Central Bank  started purchasing
the country’s debt three weeks ago.  Italy sold its 10-year bond to yield 5.22 percent. Demand
was 1.27 times the amount on offer. The Treasury also sold 2.99
billion euros of bonds maturing in 2014.  The yield on the country’s benchmark 10-year bond has
dropped more than 100 basis points since the ECB began buying
Italian and Spanish debt on Aug. 8. Before the ECB stepped in,
yields surged to euro-era records on concern the countries would
become the next victims of the region’s debt crisis.  The auction came a day after Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  bowed to demands that he revise a 45.5 billion-euro
austerity plan, dropping a tax on the highest earners and
limiting cuts to regional governments.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year
bonds over benchmark German bunds rose 10 basis points to 296
basis points at 11:21 a.m. in  Rome , compared with a euro-era
record of 416 basis points on Aug. 5.  Today’s sale will help pay for 9 billion euros of bills
maturing on Aug. 31. Italy still faces 75 billion euros of
maturing bills this year and needs to sell about 80 billion
euros of bonds to pay for redemptions and the  budget deficit .
The biggest test comes in September when about 46 billion euros
of bonds mature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
