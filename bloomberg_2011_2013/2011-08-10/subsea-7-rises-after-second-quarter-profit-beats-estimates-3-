Subsea 7 SA, the oilfield-services
provider formerly known as Acergy SA, rose in Oslo trading as
second-quarter profit beat estimates, driven by higher demand
from West  Africa , northern  Europe  and Brazil.  The shares rose 2.3 percent to 114.4 kroner as of the 5:30
p.m. close in Oslo. Net income climbed to $118 million from $54
million a year earlier, exceeding the $93 million median
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “After what now seems like a first-quarter blip, Subsea 7
is back on its 2009 and 2010 track of delivering significantly
better-than-expected figures,” Kristian Diesen and Steffen Roedsjoe, Oslo-based analysts at Pareto Securities ASA, said in
a note. Pareto may increase its 2011 estimates by 10 percent and
its 2012 projections by 5 to 10 percent, they said.  Subsea 7’s order backlog was about $7.9 billion as of June
30, it said today in a  statement . The London-based company
expects to add orders as tenders increase in the  North Sea ,
Africa,  Latin America , Asia Pacific and elsewhere, Chief
Executive Officer Jean Cahuzac said on a conference call.  Oil companies have been investing in exploration and
production following gains in energy prices. Crude futures
traded in  New York  averaged $102.34 in the second quarter, a 31
percent increase from a year earlier.  A lack of skilled personnel is the industry’s largest
challenge, Cahuzac said, adding that Subsea 7 is at an advantage
because of its size and resources. The CEO said he’s “very
pleased with our backlog and order intake, which has achieved
previous-cycle peak levels.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
