Federal Reserve bank presidents
Narayana Kocherlakota and  Richard Fisher  praised Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s leadership after casting two of the three dissenting
votes at yesterday’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.  “On this occasion, I dissented from the Committee’s
decision,” Kocherlakota, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Minneapolis, said in a statement. “Regardless, I have nothing
but the highest regard for the acumen, integrity and ability of
all other FOMC meeting participants, including the Chairman.”  Kocherlakota and Fisher joined  Charles Plosser  of the
Philadelphia Fed in posing the most opposition to a FOMC
decision in almost 19 years. They took issue with the FOMC’s
pledge to hold  interest rates  near zero at least until mid-2013,
preferring instead to maintain a commitment to do so for an
unspecified “extended period.”  “I think very highly of Ben, admire him, appreciate his
style, find him totally honest and inclusive, and also
respectful of others’ principles and views,” Fisher, president
of the Dallas Fed, wrote in response to an e-mail from the Wall
Street Journal.  The Wall Street Journal published the statements by Fisher
and Kocherlakota during the blackout period which typically
follows FOMC meetings.  Minneapolis  Fed spokeswoman Patti Lorenzen and Alexander Johnson, a spokesman at the Dallas Fed,
said the comments about Bernanke didn’t violate the blackout
because they did not pertain to macroeconomic developments or
monetary policy issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
