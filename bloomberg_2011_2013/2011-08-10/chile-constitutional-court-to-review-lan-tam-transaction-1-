Chile ’s Constitutional Court will
review  Lan Airlines SA (LAN) ’s planned $3.3 billion takeover of
 Brazil ’s  Tam SA (TAMM4)  at the request of rival carrier  Pal Airlines .  The constitutional probe won’t impede an ongoing review of
the transaction by Chile’s Antitrust Tribunal, known as TDLC,
according to documents posted on the court’s website today.  Pal presented a request to the court on Aug. 3, arguing
that if the TDLC approves the transaction any mitigation
measures will be taken from an out-of-court agreement Lan and
Tam reached in January with Chile’s National Economic Prosecutor
prior to the TDLC review. Lan and Tam pared gains today after
the court’s announcement.  “This creates more noise around the deal,” German Guerrero, a partner at Santiago-based brokerage MBI Corredores
de Bolsa SA, said by telephone today.  An official from Lan’s communications department didn’t
respond to a telephone message seeking comment.  Lan rose 0.9 percent to 11,116 pesos at the close of
Santiago trading today, after earlier gaining as much as 5.3
percent. Tam rose 4.1 percent to 25.70 reais and reached an
intraday high of 26.45 reais.  The TDLC may disclose its ruling later this month, the
tribunal said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
