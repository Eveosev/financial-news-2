Sony Corp. (SNE)  and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) 
have settled patent-infringement claims they had lodged against
each other over digital televisions and mobile phones, filings
with a U.S. trade agency and U.S. courts show.  The companies have reached a “memorandum of
understanding,” Sony and LG wrote in filings seeking the
dismissal of cases at the  International Trade Commission  in
 Washington , which has the power to block imports. Sony and LG
also filed requests to dismiss lawsuits pending in federal
court, citing a confidential settlement. Terms weren’t
disclosed.  Tokyo-based Sony and Seoul-based LG had accused each other
of infringing patents related to digital televisions and
computer monitors. LG had sought to block U.S. imports of Sony’s
Bravia televisions and PlayStation 3 consoles, while Sony had
claimed that LG televisions and mobile phones infringed its
patents.  According to a civil suit that LG’s Zenith unit filed
against Sony in October, the companies had been unable to reach
an agreement to renew a license that expired last year.  The dispute launched suits and countersuits in the U.S. and
 Europe . Sales of PlayStation 3 game consoles were halted for a
month earlier this year in the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
