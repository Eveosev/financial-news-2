A British man accused of murdering
his wife during their honeymoon in  South Africa  can be
extradited to face trial, a U.K. judge ruled.  The Secretary of State will make the final decision on
whether Shrien Dewani should be sent to South Africa to stand
trial, Judge Howard Riddle said in a ruling today. Dewani’s
lawyers had argued the process was a breach of his human rights.  “The public interest in extradition and trial outweighs
the competing hardship,” Riddle said in the ruling.  Anni Dewani was killed after a taxi she and her husband
were traveling in was carjacked near  Cape Town . South African
prosecutors allege her husband arranged the murder.  At a hearing in February, Dewani’s lawyer said he was
suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder and
depression.  A U.K. Home Office said in a statement that it had received
the Dewani case and will review whether to order the
extradition. Clare Montgomery, Dewani’s lawyer, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
