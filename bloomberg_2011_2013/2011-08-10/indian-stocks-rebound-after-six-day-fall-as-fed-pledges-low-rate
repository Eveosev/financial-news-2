Indian equities surged, halting a
six-day decline, as the U.S.  Federal Reserve  pledge to keep
 interest rates  at an all-time low eased concerns of a global
economic slowdown.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the most valuable company,
climbed the most in a month. Infosys Ltd., the second-largest
software services provider, led a rally among peers.  Coal India
Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s biggest producer of the fuel, advanced for the
first time in four days.  “The Fed is telling market participants that real rates
are going to stay down for the next two years and therefore
people should get out there and stay invested,” said Vetri Subramaniam, the Mumbai-based head of equities at Religare Asset
Management Co., which manages $2.5 billion. “They’re hoping
that this commitment to keep rates low will eventually stimulate
the economy. One shouldn’t discount the actions of the Fed.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 230.83, or 1.3 percent, to 17,088.74 at 12:01 p.m. in
Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index rose 1.5 percent to 5,147.90 and
its August futures traded at 5,174.65. The BSE 200 Index climbed
1.9 percent to 2,139.62.  The Sensex has slumped 18 percent from its Nov. 5 peak,
approaching the 20 percent level that marks a so-called  bear
market  for some investors. Evidence that policy makers are
taking steps to spur growth and restore confidence helped global
equity markets snap a nine-day rout that had wiped out $7.8
trillion in value. The Federal Reserve pledged yesterday to keep
rates near zero through mid-2013 and discussed a range of policy
tools to bolster the economy.  Reliance rallied 1.9 percent to 780.15 rupees, the most
since July 13. Its August futures traded at 783.10 rupees.  Software Makers Rally  Infosys advanced 3.6 percent to 2,460.8 rupees after it was
raised to “neutral” from “negative” at Susquehanna Financial
Group. Rival  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  jumped 3.7 percent
to 1,000.15 rupees. India’s top software exporters secure at
least 80 percent of their sales from abroad.  Coal  India  added 2 to 386.6 rupees. The Kolkata-based
company was added to the Sensex on Aug. 8 and its 22 percent
rally this year is the best among the 30 firms on the gauge.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 2.3 percent after
closing yesterday at the lowest level since Sept. 3. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index jumped 4.7 percent, the most since
March 2009. The U.S. gauge rebounded from a 6.7 percent slump on
Aug. 8 that was spurred by S&P’s unprecedented downgrade of the
nation’s credit rating.  Energy Costs  A decline in prices of crude and other commodities amid the
rout in stocks will help Indian companies cut costs and boost
earnings,  Rakesh Jhunjhunwala , a billionaire investor named the
 Warren Buffett  of India by Forbes magazine, said in an interview
with Bloomberg UTV yesterday.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has raised its repurchase rate 11
times since the start of 2010 to tackle rising prices. The
benchmark wholesale-price inflation accelerated to 9.44 percent
in June from 9.06 percent the previous month.  The Sensex trades for 14.2 times future earnings, compared
with a multiple of 9.8 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. It
has lost 16 percent this year, the second-worst performer after
 Brazil ’s Bovespa Index among major indexes in the 10 biggest
markets, on concern higher borrowing costs will erode earnings.  Earnings reported by nine out of 21 Sensex companies, or 43
percent, have lagged behind analyst estimates for the June
quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with 33
percent that missed forecasts in the previous three months.  Extension  The government extended central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao’s term by two years, a statement from the Prime
Minister’s office said yesterday, as the country opts for
continuity amid its struggle with inflation.  The nation’s economic expansion and corporate earnings
prompted foreign funds to buy a record $29.4 billion of domestic
stocks in 2010, lifting the Sensex 17 percent and making it the
best performer and most expensive among the world’s 10 biggest
markets that year.  Overseas funds sold a net 11.1 billion rupees ($246
million) of Indian equities on Aug. 8, paring their investment
in stocks this year to 64.9 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the market regulator. They were net sellers of
Indian equities in January, February and May.  -- Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporters on this story:
