Farmland and forestry will
outperform the average of all global assets long-term, according
to Jeremy Grantham, chief investment strategist for Boston-based
Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co.  Energy, metals and fertilizers will gain in 10 years,
Grantham wrote in a report. Copper has already doubled since the
end of 2005, oil is up 35 percent and sugar gained 90 percent.  Commodities rebounded today from an eight-month low as
growth in  China  spurs shortages of everything from copper to
corn. A fund controlled by  George Soros , the billionaire hedge-
fund manager, owns 23 percent of South American farmland venture
Adecoagro SA and hedge funds Ospraie Management LLC and
Passport Capital LLC have invested in agriculture.  “For those with a long horizon, I am sure well managed
forestry and farmland will outperform the average of all global
assets,” according to Grantham, who correctly predicted the low
in U.S. equities in 2009.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities is
little changed this year while the MSCI All-Country World Index
of shares dropped 9.1 percent. U.S. Treasuries returned 6.9
percent, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index shows. The Dollar
Index is down 6.4 percent.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  vowed yesterday to
keep borrowing costs at an all-time low to revive a recovery
that’s “considerably slower” than expected. Cotton jumped 1.7
percent to 97.45 cents a pound by 1:47 p.m. in  London  and wheat
jumped 2.3 percent to $7.1975 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
