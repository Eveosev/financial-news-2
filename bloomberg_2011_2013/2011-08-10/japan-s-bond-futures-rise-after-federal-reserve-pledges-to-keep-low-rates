Japan ’s bond futures climbed for a
third day in four as the  Federal Reserve ’s pledge to keep
 interest rates  at a record low for longer spurred speculation
the  Bank of Japan  will follow its U.S. counterpart.  Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds approached this year’s
low as the yen was within 1 percent of a record high against the
dollar, raising concern a stronger local currency will derail
Japan’s export-led recovery. The extra yield investors demand to
hold two-year Treasuries instead of similar-maturity Japanese
notes fell to the lowest level in almost two decades, increasing
the relative attractiveness of yen-denominated assets.  The Fed’s pledge indicates “the era of high growth for the
U.S. and  Europe  as well as the global economy overall might have
ended,” said Shuntaro Take, Tokyo-based deputy general manager
for corporate investment at Tokio Marine & Nichido Life
Insurance Co., which manages the equivalent of $43 billion in
assets. “The environment is positive for bonds.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell as much as 2.5 basis
points to 1.015 percent before moving to 1.035 percent as of
3:27 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.1 percent security due
June 2021 added 0.044 yen to 100.580 yen. The rate retreated to
0.975 percent yesterday, the least since Nov. 12. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for September delivery gained 0.06 to
142.19 at the 3 p.m. close of the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange.  Fed Pledge  Yields on 10-year Treasuries dropped to a record 2.0346
percent in  New York  yesterday after the Fed pledged to keep its
benchmark rate at a record low at least through mid-2013 to
revive a recovery. The  Federal Open Market Committee  is
“prepared to employ” more tools to bolster an economy hobbled
by weak hiring and anemic household spending, it said yesterday.  “Given the U.S. can’t raise interest rates for two
years,” people see no chance of a BOJ rate increase, Take said.  The two-year yield spread between the U.S. and Japan sank
to 4.4 basis points today, the least since July 1992.  The yen traded at 76.80 per dollar today after touching
76.30 on Aug. 1, the highest since the postwar record of 76.25
on March 17. A stronger local currency reduces the overseas
earnings at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Bonds pared gains as Japanese stocks advanced, reducing
demand for the relative safety of government debt. The  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 1.1 percent, snapping a three-day slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
