A group led by state-run VTB Group
and OAO Gazprombank won the right to build the first toll road
in  St. Petersburg , overtaking  Vinci SA (DG)  and its partners, the
 city administration  said on its website late yesterday.  The builders plan to spend 120 billion rubles ($4.1
billion) by 2014 to construct the central part of the Western
High-Speed Diameter, the most spent on a single road-
construction project in  Russia ,  Kommersant  said today citing
VTB. Investors will contribute 69 billion rubles, while the rest
will be provided by the government, the newspaper said.  The group will have a 30-year concession with guaranteed
revenue of 9.7 billion rubles a year, according to Kommersant.
Italy’s Astaldi SpA and Turkey’s Mega Yapi and IC will help
build the road, the St. Petersburg website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
