Andreas Schmitz, the president of
the Association of German Banks, said lack of strong political
leadership, especially from  Germany , has left markets uncertain
amid the sovereign-debt crisis,  Bild  reported.  As the euro area’s strongest member, Germany would be at
fault more than Greece if it “failed in its leadership role,”
Schmitz was quoted as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
