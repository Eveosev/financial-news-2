General Motors Co. (GM)  Chief Executive
Officer Dan Akerson purchased $250,500 in shares of the
automaker, a day before the company fell to a new low.  Akerson bought 10,000 shares yesterday at $25.05, Detroit-
based GM said in a regulatory filing. Akerson, 62, owns 103,600
shares after the purchase, today’s filing said.  The stock-market rout that sent the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  to its lowest since September 2010 helped send GM shares
a new closing low in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading
since the automaker’s November initial public offering. GM fell
$1.62, or 6.3 percent, to $23.92 as of 4:15 p.m.  Akerson, GM’s CEO since September, said yesterday he was
unsure whether “turmoil” in the securities markets may
discourage consumers from buying new vehicles. The largest U.S.
automaker has forecast at least 13 million new-vehicle sales in
2011, including medium- and heavy-duty trucks.  “We’re a little unsure of these numbers,” Akerson said at
a conference with analysts yesterday. “When the market does
recover, we should be able to really leverage it beyond what
you’ve seen so far since our IPO.”  Akerson’s purchase of GM stock is the second in less than
three months. He bought $939,900 in shares of the automaker on
May 11, when GM traded at $31.33, according to a filing the
following day.  Cost Cuts  GM will benefit from moves to cut costs planned for the
next decade, Akerson and other executives said yesterday.  Dan Ammann, GM’s chief financial officer, said frequent
changes to the automaker’s product plan waste $1 billion a year.
Canceling or delaying product programs adds to engineering costs
because GM has to pay more to suppliers when orders change,
Ammann said during a  presentation .  GM plans to reduce the number of architectures that its
vehicles are built from to 14 by 2018, from 30 in 2010. The
number of engine platforms will be cut by about half in the next
decade, according to a slideshow presentation.  GM may be able to improve its profit margins by 2.3
percentage points from last year to 7.4 percent by 2015,
Barclays Capital analyst  Brian Johnson  said today in a research
note. GM didn’t commit to a specific margin target, said
Johnson, who rates GM “overweight” and is based in New York.  At today’s closing price, the value of the U.S. Treasury
Department’s stake in GM has plunged $7.53 billion since Jan. 7.
GM shares closed that day at $38.98, the highest since the IPO.  Treasury holds more than 500 million shares, making it GM’s
largest owner. The government’s stake is worth $12 billion, down
from $19.5 billion as of Jan. 7.  The  U.S. Treasury  took a 61 percent stake in GM as part of
its $49.5 billion bailout of the automaker. The Treasury sold
$13.6 billion worth of stock in the November IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
