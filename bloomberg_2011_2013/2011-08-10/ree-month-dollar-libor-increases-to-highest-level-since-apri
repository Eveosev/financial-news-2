The rate that London-based banks say
they can borrow at for three months in dollars rose for a 12th
consecutive day, reaching the highest since April.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
increased to 0.28061 percent today from 0.27839 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest rate since April 12.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, widened to 19.76 basis points as of 12:05 p.m. in
London, from 19.14 basis points yesterday. That’s the most since
Aug. 13, 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
