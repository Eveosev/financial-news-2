Turkeyâ€™s financial authorities will
hand out record fines to speculators and short-sellers after
investigating volatile share movements on the Istanbul exchange
in the last two days,  Haberturk  reported.  The Capital Markets Board and Istanbul exchange are
coordinating in the investigation into trades, the newspaper
said, citing unidentified officials.  The Capital Markets Board has tracked short-sellers who
were offloading shares for sale without owning them, instigating
sell-offs and creating panic in the market, Haberturk said.  Guilty traders face fines of 115,000 liras ($66,000) per
transaction, Haberturk reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
