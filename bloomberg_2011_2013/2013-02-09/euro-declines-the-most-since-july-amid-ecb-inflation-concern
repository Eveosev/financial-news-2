The euro declined the most since July
versus the dollar after European Central Bank President Mario
Draghi said a strong currency could slow the region’s economic
recovery, lifting bets the bank may lower interest rates.  The yen declined against the greenback for the first time
in 13 weeks as the Bank of Japan governor said he will step down
early, accelerating a transition that may aid the prime
minister’s plan for monetary easing. The BOJ will meet on Feb.
14. The 17-nation euro fell against all but two of its 16 most-
traded peers this week as Italian and Spanish bonds slumped amid
political turmoil, damping demand for the currency.  “The euro correction is probably long overdue,”  Greg Anderson , New York-based head of Group of 10 currency strategy
at Citigroup Inc., said yesterday in a telephone interview.
“The market bought into the theme that the ECB is going to be
the tightest of the G-4 central banks because they won’t do
anything while everyone else does quantitative easing. What
Draghi did changed the psychology a bit.”  The Federal Reserve, ECB, BOJ and Bank of England comprise
the G-4.  The euro declined 2 percent to $1.3366 this week and
touched $1.3353 yesterday, its weakest level since Jan. 25. The
loss was the euro’s biggest drop since the five days ended July
6. The shared currency fell 2.2 percent to 123.88 yen. The yen
depreciated 0.1 percent to 92.88 per dollar after touching 94.06
on Feb. 6, its lowest level since May 5, 2010.  Real, Krona  The Brazilian real was the biggest winner among major
currencies this week, climbing 0.8 percent to 1.9727 per dollar.
Sweden’s krona fell the most, decreasing 2.2 percent to 6.4479
per dollar.  Futures traders increased their bets that the euro will
gain against the U.S. dollar,  figures  from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The difference in the
number of wagers by hedge funds and other large speculators on
an advance in the euro compared with those on a drop -- so-
called net longs -- was 37,952 on Feb. 5, compared with net
longs of 27,472 a week earlier.  Net-wagers  the yen  will fall against the dollar decreased,
pushing net-shorts to 68,413.  The euro, which touched a 14-month high of $1.3711 on Feb.
1, has been the best performer this year among 10 developed-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes, gaining 2 percent. The yen weakened the most, 6.6
percent, and the dollar increased 0.6 percent.  Pound Rises  The shared currency dropped as Spanish Prime Minister
Mariano Rajoy faced calls to resign after newspaper reports
alleged he accepted illegal cash payments, and as a poll showed
former Italy Premier Silvio Berlusconi closing the gap on front-
runner Pier Luigi Bersani even as he appeals a four-year prison
sentence for tax fraud.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield climbed to 5.52 percent, the
highest since Dec. 11, and Italian 10-year yields reached 4.63
percent, highest since Dec. 14.  The British pound rose the most in two years this week
versus the euro amid bets the Bank of England will refrain from
extending its stimulus program in contrast to its European
counterpart.  Future BOE Governor Mark Carney, the current chief of the
Bank of Canada, said on Feb. 7 that current monetary policy may
be enough to help the economy, while the ECB’s Draghi said the
region’s policy may “remain accommodative.”  ‘Aggressive Easing’  “We might see a stronger sterling against the euro,”
 Eimear Daly , a currency-market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. in
London, said in a Feb. 8 interview. “The market had priced in
aggressive easing from Carney and they were probably
disappointed. The move was compounded by what we saw from
Draghi.”  Sterling appreciated 2.7 percent to 84.59 pence per euro
this week, its biggest five-day drop since January 2011. The
pound gained 0.7 percent to $1.5796.  Australia’s dollar decreased for a fourth week, the longest
stretch since June, after the Reserve Bank cut its economic
growth and inflation forecasts, fanning expectations it will
lower interest rates.  The RBA predicted “below trend” 2013 growth of about 2.5
percent, compared with around 2.75 percent forecast in November.
Consumer prices will rise 3 percent in the year to June 2013,
compared with the 3.25 percent increase forecast three months
earlier, the central bank said.  ‘Rate Cut’  That statement from the RBA followed comments it make on
Feb. 5 that the nation’s inflation outlook “would afford scope
to ease policy further.”  “The reduction in growth and inflation forecasts is a
cause for concern,”  Takuya Kawabata , an analyst at Gaitame.com
Research Institute Ltd. in Tokyo, a unit of Japan’s largest
currency margin company, said yesterday. “The recent weakness
in the Australian dollar in part stems from speculation of a
rate cut by the RBA.”  The so-called Aussie declined 0.9 percent to $1.0318 after
falling to $1.0256 yesterday, its lowest level since Oct. 23.
The New Zealand dollar fell 1.1 percent to 83.57 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
