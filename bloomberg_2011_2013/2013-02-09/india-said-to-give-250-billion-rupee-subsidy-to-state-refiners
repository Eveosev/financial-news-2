India will give state-run refiners
including  Indian Oil Corp.  250 billion rupees ($4.66 billion) as
compensation for selling fuels below cost in the quarter ended
Dec. 31, two finance ministry officials with direct knowledge of
the matter said today.  The compensation will help bolster earnings at the
refiners, the officials said, asking not to be identified
because the information is still confidential. D.S. Malik, a
spokesman for the finance ministry, and R.C. Joshi, a spokesman
for the oil ministry, declined to comment.  State refiners sell fuels below cost to help curb  inflation 
in Asiaâ€™s third-largest economy. The government compensates the
companies for such losses, which totaled 1.24 trillion rupees,
including 738.2 billion rupees on diesel, in the nine months
ended Dec. 31, according to oil ministry  data .  The government in January allowed refiners to fix diesel
prices on their own for the first time in more than a decade,
seeking to narrow its subsidy bill. The refiners sell diesel,
cooking gas and kerosene at fixed prices. They are partly
compensated by government cash payments and discounts on crude
oil sold by state explorers including Oil & Natural Gas Corp.  ONGC is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
