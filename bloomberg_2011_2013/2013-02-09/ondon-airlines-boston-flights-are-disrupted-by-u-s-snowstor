Flights to Boston from London were
disrupted for a second day after a storm dumped more than two
feet of snow on the U.S. Northeast.  IAG ’s British Airways canceled two of its three flights to
Boston today, a spokeswoman said, while Virgin Atlantic Airways
Ltd. scrapped its London-to-Boston service for a second day.
London’s Heathrow Airport said three outgoing and 32 incoming
U.S. flights had been canceled.  British Airways said it was running a full schedule between
New York and London, though customers on early flights may
experience delays. A Virgin spokeswoman said the airline was
running a full service to New York after canceling flights
yesterday.  The U.S. regions worst affected by the blizzard were the
central and eastern portions of Long Island and Connecticut,
where 2 to 3 feet of snow fell, Joey Picca, a meteorologist with
the National Weather Service in New York, said by phone at 6
a.m. local time today. New York City received between 8 inches
and 15 inches of snow, Picca said, compared with as much as 2
feet that fell across Massachusetts.  British Airways said it expects to resume full service
tomorrow, though it will continue to monitor the weather and
make decisions accordingly. Virgin said it was monitoring the
situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
