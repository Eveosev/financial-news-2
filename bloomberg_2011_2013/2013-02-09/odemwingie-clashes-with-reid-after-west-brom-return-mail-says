West Brom forward Peter Odemwingie
clashed with a teammate following his attempt to move to Queens
Park Rangers last month, the Daily Mail said.  Odemwingie confronted Peter Reid at West Brom’s training
ground after comments attributed to the defender suggested
Odemwingie would not be welcome back at the club, the Mail said.
Reid told Odemwingie he’d have to work hard to win over his
teammates, the newspaper said.  West Brom fined Odemwingie 75,000 pounds ($118,000) for
driving to London to meet with QPR officials on the final day of
the January transfer period, the Mail said. He didn’t have West
Brom’s approval and was turned away by QPR.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
