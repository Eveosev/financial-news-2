Norway’s  Aksel Lund Svindal  won his
fifth career gold medal at the alpine skiing world championships
by taking today’s men’s downhill in Schladming, Austria.  Svindal, 30, crossed the finish line in a time of 2
minutes, 01.32 seconds, 0.46 seconds ahead of Italy’s Dominik
Paris, who leads the  World Cup  downhill season standings. David
Poisson of France was third, 0.97 second behind.  “I had nothing more,” Svindal, 30, told Eurosport after
his run. “I took a lot of risks, didn’t make any big mistakes
and made it to the finish.”  Svindal becomes the sixth man with at least five world
titles. It’s his eighth career medal at the championships and
his second this year after a bronze in the super-G three days
ago. He also won the downhill title in Are, Sweden, in 2007.  Defending champion Eric Guay didn’t finish his run. The
Canadian was attempting to become the first man to successfully
defend his downhill world title since Switzerland’s Bernhard
Russi in 1972.  The world championships continue tomorrow in Schladming
with the women’s downhill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
