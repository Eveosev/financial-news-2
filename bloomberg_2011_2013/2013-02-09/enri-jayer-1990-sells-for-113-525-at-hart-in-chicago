A case of 1990 wine from Burgundy
producer  Henri Jayer ’s Vosne-Romanee Cros Parantoux vineyard
sold for $113,525 at a Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. auction in
Chicago as demand persisted for rarities from the region.  Jayer, who died in 2006, has become one of Burgundy’s most
sought-after wine-makers. His Cros Parantoux, from a 2.5-acre (1
hectare) premier cru vineyard that was an artichoke field in
World War II, acquired trophy status in sales last year, notably
after a case of the 1985 vintage fetched HK$2.06 million
($265,645) at a  Christie’s International Plc  auction in Hong
Kong last February.  Demand in recent weeks has been buoyed by China’s New Year
celebrations, amid signs of a recovery in fine-wine demand since
the start of this year. The  Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index  of leading
clarets rose 3.5 percent in January, its biggest monthly gain
for two years. Investor appetite in China that drove Bordeaux
prices to record levels in mid-2011 before a price slump has now
switched increasingly to rarer Burgundies.  Other top lots in the  Hart Davis Hart  sale, held on Feb. 2,
included two Romanee-Conti 1990 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti
Assortment cases, one of which fetched $41,825 and the other
$38,240, and a case of La Tache 1999 DRC which sold for $38,240.  Among leading Bordeaux wines in the sale, a case of Chateau
Petrus 1982 fetched $38,240 and 12 bottles of the same Pomerol
producer’s 2008 vintage $28,680. A case of 2009 wine from
neighboring vineyard Chateau Lafleur went under the hammer for
$20,315.  Following is a table of major auctions held so far this
year.  To contact the reporter on the story:
