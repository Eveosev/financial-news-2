MCX Stock Exchange Ltd. will compete
with the BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. from
Feb. 11 after the bourse’s equity derivatives trading was
inaugurated by Finance Minister  Palaniappan Chidambaram .  The new exchange’s benchmark SX40 Index of 40 large and
liquid stocks, which includes India’s biggest companies by
market value  Reliance Industries Ltd ., Tata Consultancy Services
Ltd. and  Oil & Natural Gas Ltd. , was unveiled by Chidambaram in
Mumbai today.  The bourse will battle for a share of the $1.3 trillion
stock market, with the Goldman Sachs Group Inc.-backed National
Stock Exchange and the BSE, Asia’s oldest. While the NSE
controls more than 90 percent of the nation’s $28 billion equity
derivatives market and handles 75 percent of the stock trades,
the MCX-SX had a 44 percent share of the currency-futures market
in the year ended March, surpassing the NSE’s 39 percent.  About 25 million Indian households invest directly or
indirectly in the capital markets, according to a survey in July
2011 by the  National Council of Applied Economic Research .
Retail participation at 1.3 percent of the population compares
with 9.4 percent in China, 41 percent in Australia and 18
percent in the U.K.,  Thomas Mathew , a former joint secretary in
the Ministry of Finance’s capital markets division, said in an
interview on Sept. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
