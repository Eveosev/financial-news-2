Carmelo Anthony  had 36 points and
nine rebounds to lead the New York Knicks to a 100-94 National
Basketball Association win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.  The Knicks (32-16) top the Eastern Conference’s five-team
Atlantic Division, four games ahead of the Brooklyn Nets (29-21)
who lost 89-74 to the Washington Wizards.  The Knicks, who had a 52-45 halftime advantage last night,
were outscored 31-18 to trail by 76-70 at the end of the third
quarter at Target Center in Minneapolis.  Derrick Williams made a 17-foot jumper with seven minutes
left in the game to put the Timberwolves (18-29) ahead by 11
points 87-76.  Anthony scored 12 points in the final minutes to help the
Knicks recover their lead. He reached at least 30 points for the
17th time this season.  Reserve J.R. Smith added 15 points and  Raymond Felton ,
 Amar’e Stoudemire  and  Steve Novak  each had 11 points for the
Knicks.  Luke Ridnour  scored 20 points, Williams had 19 and  Ricky Rubio  added 18 for the Timberwolves, who are fifth in the
Western Conference’s Northwest Division, 18 1/2 games behind
Oklahoma City.  The Knicks, who host the Los Angeles Clippers at Madison
Square Garden tomorrow, spent the night in Minneapolis when the
snowstorm that swept the U.S. Northeast interrupted their travel
plans. They plan to leave today for New York if the weather
permits.  At Verizon Center in Washington, Nenê had 20 points and 11
rebounds and  John Wall  added 15 for the Wizards, who owned a
51-31 lead at the half.  Deron Williams  led the Nets with 20 points and  Joe Johnson 
scored 14.  Reggie Evans  had nine points and 13 rebounds.  Washington (14-35) is third in the Eastern Conference’s
five-team Southeast division, 20 games behind the league-leading
Miami Heat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
