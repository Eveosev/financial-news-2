Treasury 10-year note yields declined
the most in 10 weeks as refuge demand re-emerged amid political
turmoil adding to concern Europe’s economy may founder.  U.S. 10-year notes, which have suffered more than double
the losses of the broader Treasury market this year, lured
investors after yields exceeded 2 percent and reached a 10-month
high. Efforts to trim the European Union budget added to concern
the region’s economy will struggle to expand and German exports
grew less than forecast in December. The Treasury will sell $72
billion in coupon securities next week.  “We’ve seen some rotation back into Treasuries as the
risk-on rally has relaxed some and risk-off has come back in
vogue,” said  Larry Milstein , managing director in New York of
government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. “We’ve found
somewhat of an equilibrium in the market. We may not see a huge
rally, but the momentum is positive for Treasuries.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  fell seven basis points this week,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.95 percent in New York, according
to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield drop was the most
since the five days ended Nov. 30.The 1.625 percent note due in
November 2022 added 19/32, or $5.94per $1,000 face amount, to 97
1/8.  The yield last touched 2 percent on Feb. 6 and reached 1.92
percent on Feb. 1, the least since Jan. 25.  Central Level  “The market is centered around the 2 percent level,”
 Jason Rogan , director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors. “We’re towards the low side of that pivot point.”  Ten-year notes have lost 1.7 percent this year, more than
twice the 0.8 percent loss in the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes. The last
time the security started the year with larger declines was
2011, when it lost 2.48 percent.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  increased 
their net-long position in 10-year note futures in the week
ending Feb. 5, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Speculative long positions, or bets prices will
rise, gained 10 percent to 46,906 contracts on the Chicago Board
of Trade.  Traders increased bets on declines in 30-year bond futures
by 37 percent to the most since March, while trimming net long
positions 24 percent on five-year note futures, the data show.  Price Swings  Volatility  in Treasuries dropped to the lowest since Jan.
24. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures
price swings of U.S. government securities based on options, was
59.9 basis points yesterday after rising to 66.4 basis points on
Jan. 30, the most since Nov. 6.  “We’re in this continuing range, given the economic and
political uncertainty,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees
$2.1 billion as chief investment officer at United Nations
Federal Credit Union in New York. “We have the economic
expansion that’s been muted. There’s a wall of investor interest
at 2 percent or slightly above.”  The Treasury kept next week’s so-called quarterly refunding
auctions at $72 billion, the amount sold since November 2010.
Given the government’s financing needs, it sells three-, 10- and
30-year securities each month in addition to its historical
quarterly offerings.  The U.S. will sell $32 billion in three-year notes on Feb.
12, $24 billion in 10-year notes on Feb. 13, and $16 billion in
30-year bonds on Feb. 14.  Europe’s Budget  European Union leaders agreed to a seven-year budget that
cuts spending for the first time, bowing to U.K. Prime Minister
David Cameron’s insistence on thrift. The deal, struck after 25
1/2 hours of talks in Brussels, set the budget for 2014-2020 at
960 billion euros ($1.3 trillion), down from an original
proposal of 1.047 trillion euros and less than the 994 billion
euros spent in the current budget cycle.  Germany’s exports gained 0.3 percent from November, when
they fell 2.2 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said yesterday. Economists forecast a 1.4 percent
increase, according to the median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The U.S. trade gap shrank 20.7 percent to $38.5 billion,
lower than any estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 73 economists
and the least since January 2010, Commerce Department figures
showed yesterday in Washington.  A Commerce Department report on Jan. 30 showed the economy
contracted at a 0.1 percent annual rate in the final three
months of the year. The trade figures probably mean the economy
managed to eke out a gain when revised data are released on Feb
28.  “The trade number was not favorable to Treasuries because
it will add to gross domestic product,” said  David Coard , head
of fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, a
brokerage for institutional investors.  The 10-year note will yield 1.95 percent at the end of June
and 2.23 percent by Dec. 31, according to the weighted average
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
