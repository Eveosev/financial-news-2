The Dutch province of Groningen,
which sits on the Slochteren gas deposit, was hit by another
earthquake as pressure grows on  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  and  Exxon
Mobil Corp.  to cut output amid forecasts of heavier temblors.  A quake measuring 2.7 on the Richter scale struck the area
at about 6:30 a.m. local time, following two quakes on Feb. 7
and yesterday, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute,
or KNMI, said in a  statement  on its website. The village of ’t
Zand, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) northeast of Amsterdam,
was at the epicenter of the latest earthquake, KNMI said.  The Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV, or NAM, the Dutch
gas-production venture between Shell and Exxon that operates the
Slochteren field, will compensate for all damage caused by the
earthquakes, it said yesterday. The venture has set aside 100
million euros ($134 million) for claims, it said.  Earthquakes have taken place in the northern Netherlands
since 1986 and “have been linked by experts to gas
production,” NAM said yesterday. The Dutch parliament on Feb. 7
discussed the risks of gas production as municipalities and the
executives of the province council urge the government and field
operators to lower output and slow activity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
