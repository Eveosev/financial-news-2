Syrian President  Bashar al-Assad  made
changes to his cabinet today, replacing the petroleum and
finance ministers, as the country’s economy falters after almost
two years of civil conflict.  Assad appointed Suleiman al-Abbas as the minister of
petroleum and mineral resources and Ismael Ismael as finance
minister, the official  Syrian Arab News Agency  said, citing a
legislative decree. He also named ministers for housing and
urban development, public works, agriculture, labor and social
affairs, the news service said.  More than 60,000 people have died in the conflict that
started in March 2011, according to the United Nations, that
pits forces loyal to Assad against rebels who are seeking an end
to the rule of his family. Production of foodstuffs including
cereals, fruits and vegetables have dropped by as much as 50
percent, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization
in Rome.  Power rationing has worsened since the start of violence as
fighting disrupts supplies and prevents repairs to damaged
infrastructure. Fuel is also in short supply. Sugar consumption
fell by as much as 40 percent during the past 12 months as the
civil war shut down confectionery shops, T. Akhras Group
Chairman Tarif Akhras said in an interview on Feb. 2.  A separate decree also established the Ministry of Social
Affairs and the Ministry of Labor, the Syrian Arab News Agency
said. Security positions remained unchanged, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
