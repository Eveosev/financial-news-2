The Canadian dollar touched the
weakest level this month versus its U.S. counterpart, sliding
below parity, as an unexpected drop in employment in January
added to concern the world’s 11th-largest economy is slowing.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government  bond  rose for the
first week since Jan. 18 as the country had its ninth straight
monthly trade deficit and housing starts fell to the lowest
since the end of the 2009 recession. Manufacturing sales fell in
December, data next week may show. Oil, Canada’s biggest export,
fell for the first time in nine weeks, and investors erased bets
that interest rates may rise this year.  “The sentiment for the Canadian economy has been shifting,
and something like the jobs data sends a signal that we’re in
more of a precarious situation today than we thought,”  Aaron Fennell , a futures specialist at Bank of Nova Scotia’s
ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto, said yesterday by phone from Toronto.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is nicknamed for the
image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.6
percent to C$1.0020 per U.S. dollar this week in Toronto. The
currency slid yesterday past its 200-day moving average of 99.90
cents and touched C$1.0035, the weakest since Jan. 31. One
Canadian dollar buys 99.80 U.S cents.  The yield on Canada’s benchmark  10-year  government bond
dropped eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, this week
to 1.96 percent. The 2.75 percent security maturing in June 2022
climbed 68 cents to C$106.71. Two-year yields slid eight basis
points to 1.11 percent.  Bond Auction  The government will auction C$3.3 billion ($3.29 billion)
of two-year notes on Feb. 13. The 1 percent securities are due
in May 2015.  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said Jan. 23 the need
to raise interest rates is less urgent than previously thought
because Canada’s economy will take longer to reach full output.
The central bank lowered its growth forecast for this year to 2
percent, from an October prediction of 2.3 percent.  The central bank has kept its  benchmark rate  at 1 percent
since 2010 to spur the economy. Policy makers said last month an
increase in the rate may still be needed over time.  Trading in overnight index swaps the day before yesterday’s
employment data showed investors had priced in 12.3 basis points
of tightening by the Bank of Canada by its December meeting,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed. After the report, the data
showed 2.8 basis points of easing was priced in.  Jobs Lost  The loonie slid yesterday as Statistics Canada reported
 employment  fell in January for the first time in six months,
dropping by 21,900 jobs following December’s revised gain of
31,200. The unemployment rate decreased to 7 percent, from 7.1
percent, the lowest since December 2008’s 6.8 percent, as fewer
people looked for work.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had projected a
5,000-job gain and 7.2 percent unemployment.  Canada’s trade deficit narrowed in December to C$901
million from a revised C$1.67 billion last month as imports fell
faster than exports, a government report showed. Housing starts
plunged 19 percent in January to an annual pace of 160,577,
Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said in a statement.  Manufacturing sales  fell 0.8 percent in December after
rising 1.75 percent the previous month, economists in a
Bloomberg survey forecast before the data is reported Feb. 15.  In the U.S., Canada’s largest trade partner, the trade
deficit narrowed more than forecast in December to $38.5
billion, from a revised $48.6 billion in November. A $46 billion
gap had been forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  ‘Matters More’  “What matters more for Canada is the U.S. market, and the
trade balance improved a lot in the U.S.,”  Sebastien Galy , a
foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA, said by
phone from New York. “That’s the reason why dollar-Canada, even
though it got hit and the risks are asymmetric, considering how
badly positioned the market is for news out of Canada, it’s
really a very subdued reaction.”  The loonie fell this week as crude oil lost 2.1 percent to
$95.76 and Standard and Poor’s  GSCI Index  of 24 commodities
declined 0.1 percent in its first weekly drop since the five
days ended Dec. 7. Raw materials account for almost half of
Canada’s export revenue. The S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks rose
0.3 percent, its lowest weekly gain since Dec. 7.  Hedge funds and other large speculators decreased their
bets that the Canadian dollar will gain against the U.S. dollar
to the lowest level since August, figures from the Washington-
based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The difference
in the number of wagers on an advance in the Canadian dollar
compared with those on a drop -- so-called  net longs  -- was
27,761 on Feb. 5, compared with 35,057 the week before.  Beats Euro  The Canadian dollar posted its first five-day gain versus
the euro in more than a month. It appreciated 1.5 percent to
C$1.3394 after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said
Feb. 7 the euro’s strength may hamper efforts to pull the
currency bloc’s economy out of recession, fueling bets the bank
may lower interest rates.  “Risk sentiment in general has been hit, especially in
Europe, the Spanish equity markets, the periphery equity
markets, have all taken on some water, and Canada may have to an
extent benefitted because there was no news on it for the
longest time,”  David Watt , chief economist at the Canadian unit
of HSBC Holdings Plc, said yesterday by phone from Toronto.  Even after the jobs report, the Canadian dollar was one of
five winners this week in a basket of 10 developed-nation
currencies monitored by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The loonie added 0.4 percent, trailing sterling’s 1.8 percent
rise, the U.S. dollar’s 1 percent gain and the yen’s 1.1 percent
advance. Australia’s dollar added 0.1 percent. The Swedish krona
dropped 1.4 percent and the euro lost 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
