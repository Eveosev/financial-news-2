Petra Kvitova and Lucie Safarova gave
Czech Republic a 2-0 lead over Australia in the first round of
tennis’s Fed Cup.  Kvitova beat Jarmila Gajdosova and Safarove defeated
Samantha Stosur, both in straight sets, to leave the two-time
defending champion needing one win from tomorrow’s three matches
in Ostrava, Czech Republic, to reach the semifinals of the top
women’s team competition.  Varvara Lepchenko beat Roberta Vinci in three sets to leave
the U.S. tied 1-1 with Italy. Sara Errani’s win over Jamie
Hampton gave the Italians the lead.  Ayumi Morita won in straight sets to give Japan into a 1-1
tie with Russia in Moscow, while Slovakia’s Dominika Cibulkova
retired with cramps while leading 6-4, 5-4 to allow Serbia to
tie that matchup 1-1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
