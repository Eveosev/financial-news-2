Baltimore Orioles righthanders  Jim Johnson , who recorded a Major League Baseball-leading 51 saves
in 2012, and  Jason Hammel  agreed to one-year contracts to avoid
arbitration, the team said.  Johnson, 29, who was 2-1 with a 2.49 earned run average
last year, set a franchise single-season record with 51 saves in
54 chances.  The Orioles didn’t release financial terms. The contract is
worth $6.5 million with a further $50,000 in performance bonuses,
the Baltimore Sun reported, without saying where it got the
information. Johnson earned $2.6 million last year.  Hammel, 30, who was 8-6 with a 3.43 ERA in 20 starts for
the Orioles in 2012, agreed to a contract worth $6.75 million
with $300,000 in performance incentives, the Sun reported.
Hammel earned $4.75 million last year.  Righthander  Darren O’Day  is the last Orioles player
eligible for arbitration yet to sign a 2013 contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
