Saudi Arabian stocks ended four days
of losses, boosted by banks and fertilizer and investment
companies, even as the benchmark index remained below 7,000
points.  The Tadawul All Share Index added 0.2 percent to 6,991.97
by the close in Riyadh today, with  Kingdom Holding Co.  gaining
6.8 percent to 21.9 riyals, the highest level in more than five
years.  Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co.  advanced 3 percent, the
biggest intraday gain since Dec. 8, while  Al Rajhi Bank , the
kingdom’s biggest lender by market value, climbed 0.4 percent.  The market opened with “modest gains” before easing and
then rebounding “with an aim to return back above 7,000
points,” Mohammed Al-Omran, a financial analyst and president
of the Gulf Center for Financial Consultancy in Riyadh, said in
an e-mailed response to questions. “I think there are no major
motives for the market in general and this is why the direction
is not clear,” he said.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian gulf
bourse that operates Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
