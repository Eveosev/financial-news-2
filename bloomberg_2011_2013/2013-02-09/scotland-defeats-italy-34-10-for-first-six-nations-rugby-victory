Defending champion Wales beat France
16-6 in European rugby’s Six Nations tournament as Scotland
routed Italy 34-10.  George North scored the game’s only try with eight minutes
remaining and Leigh Halfpenny kicked 11 points for Wales at the
Stade de France in Paris. The Welsh rebounded from last week’s
opening loss to Ireland and handed France, the favorite with
U.K. bookmakers to win the title, its second straight loss.  Tim Visser, Matthew Scott, Stuart Hogg and Sean Lamont
scored tries to lead Scotland past Italy in Edinburgh. Greig
Laidlaw kicked 14 points as Scotland won its first game.  The second round of matches concludes tomorrow as unbeatens
Ireland and England meet in Dublin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
