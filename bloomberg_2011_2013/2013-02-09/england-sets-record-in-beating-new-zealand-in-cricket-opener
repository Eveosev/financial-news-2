England took advantage of short
boundaries to post its highest Twenty20 total and beat New
Zealand by 40 runs to open their three-match cricket series.  Eoin Morgan  scored 46 and  Luke Wright  had 42 to lead
England to 214-7 after being put in to bat in Auckland. New
Zealand was limited to 174-9 in reply.  England hit 15 sixes, with Wright getting four, and 16
fours in surpassing its previous mark of 202-6 set against South
Africa in 2009. The total also tied Australia for the highest
score at Eden Park.  England captain  Stuart Broad  said it was his team’s best
performance with him as skipper.  “A lot of time you think 170, 180 is a good score,” Broad
said on the England and Wales Cricket Board’s website. “To go
and get such a high score and defend it comprehensively, we’re
delighted with that.”  Broad took 4-24 and Steven Finn 3-39 as New Zealand
struggled in its innings. Martin Guptil top-scored for the Black
Caps with 44.  “We were outplayed by a far better team on the day,” New
Zealand captain  Brendon McCullum  said.  The Twenty20 series continues in Hamilton in three days and
concludes Feb. 15 at Wellington. The teams will also play three
one-day matches, beginning Feb. 17, followed a three-game Test
series opening March 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
