Six bottles of  Moet & Chandon  1911
champagne are estimated to fetch as much as 40,000 pounds
($63,200) at a  Christie’s International Plc  sale in London this
month, according to the auction house’s online  catalog .  The champagne, labeled Grand Vintage, is part of a series
of 200 bottles disgorged in January 2011.  Michael Broadbent ,
founder of Christie’s wine department and a senior consultant to
the company, describes 1911 in his book “Vintage Wine” as the
best year for Champagne between 1874 and 1921.  The sale comes after the Liv-ex  Fine Wine 50 Index  rose 3.5
percent last month, its biggest monthly gain for two years,
after a drop of 9.7 percent in 2012. January auctions in Hong
Kong by Zachys and Acker Merrall & Condit and a sale earlier
this month in Chicago by Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. showed that
investors and collectors are looking to take advantage of lower
prices following market declines in 2012, dealers said.  Other wines in the auction include a case of Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild 1982 Bordeaux estimated at as much as 30,000
pounds and 12 bottles of Chateau Petrus 1989 priced at as much
as 24,000 pounds.  Also on sale is a bottle of Napoleon Grande Fine Champagne
Reserve Vintage 1811 Cognac, badly bin-soiled and with a damaged
label, dating from when the emperor’s troops were fighting in
Spain and preparing to march on Moscow the following year.  Here is a list of global wine sales scheduled so far this
year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to auction
house sale catalogs and websites.
