The union for pilots at  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s
American Airlines is appealing a U.S. bankruptcy judge’s
decision that denied the company’s request to reject a labor
contract with the union and impose cost reductions.  The  Allied Pilots Association  filed a notice of appeal
today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. The union didn’t
give a reason for the appeal in the filing.  On Aug. 15, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane denied
American’s request to void its contract with the pilots, finding
that two elements of American’s proposal for the pilots weren’t
justified.  Lane invited Fort Worth, Texas-based American to revise its
proposal and come back to court for approval. The judge said
American had shown that “significant changes” to the
collective bargaining agreement are necessary for the company’s
bankruptcy reorganization.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
