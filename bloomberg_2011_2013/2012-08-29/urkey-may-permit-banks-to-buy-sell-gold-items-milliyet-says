Turkish banks would be able to buy
and sell gold coins and jewelry under legislation being drafted
by the banking regulator,  Milliyet  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The matter is on the agenda because people want to withdraw
savings in the form of gold, rather than in Turkish lira or in
foreign exchange, the newspaper said, citing Erdal Aral,  Turkiye
Is Bankasi AS (ISCTR) ’s deputy chief executive officer. The move would
“seriously hit revenues” and push traditional jewellers into
underground trading, according to Kamil Karakas, the chairman of
gold producer Karatas Atlantis Kiymetli Madenler AS, Milliyet
said.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
