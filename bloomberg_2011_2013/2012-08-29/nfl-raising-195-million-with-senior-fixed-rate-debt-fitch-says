The  National Football League  is
selling $195 million of senior fixed-rate notes due in 2024,
according to Fitch Ratings, which gave the debt a grade of A.  The most-watched U.S. sports league intends to issue the
notes through its Football Trust unit and proceeds from the
offering will be used for capital and other corporate purposes,
Fitch said today in a statement.  The New York-based league that’s home to the Dallas Cowboys
and  New York  Jets “promotes financial stability and competitive
balance through a high percentage of revenue sharing,” Fitch
analysts led by Chad Lewis wrote in the report. Debt service
“is supported by large contractual revenue streams from
investment-grade counterparties and a collective bargaining
agreement” that limits team costs with a salary cap.  Greg Aiello , a spokesman for the NFL, didn’t immediately
respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment on the
bond offering. An A rating is the sixth-highest of 10
investment-grade rankings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
