Bonds of  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI)  dropped
after  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  analysts lowered their recommendation
on the miner’s debt to neutral from overweight, as expected
prices for metallurgical coal have dipped.  Arch’s $1 billion of 7.25 percent notes due June 2021
dropped 3.7 cents to 91 cents, the biggest decline since they
were issued in May, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The yield
climbed to 8.74 percent from 8.11 percent. The company’s $1
billion of 7 percent notes due June 2019 dropped 0.75 cent to
91.75 cents on the dollar, the biggest decline in three weeks.  JPMorgan lowered its opinion on the bonds after the 7.25
percent notes increased 14 cents since July 26 to 94.7 cents on
the dollar yesterday, analyst Dave Katz wrote in a note to
investors today.  The analyst’s recommendation reflects a decline in prices
for metallurgical coal, which is used to make products such as
steel. Spot prices for hard coking coal at $164 per tonne are
down from benchmark contract prices for the third quarter of
2012 of $225 per tonne, Katz wrote. While prices of thermal coal
used for heating have climbed, the price is unlikely to increase
further after a 15 percent drop in natural  gas prices  since July
to $2.72 per million British thermal units, Katz wrote.  Katz said he expects Arch Coal’s earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization to decline from $615
million to $360 million if coking coal prices remain at about
$180 per tonne for 2013. Arch will perform better than other
producers more dependent on metallurgical, or met, coal, such as
Bristol, Virginia-based  Alpha Natural (ANR)  Inc. Met coal accounts for
20 percent of Alpha’s volume and 5 percent of Arch’s, he wrote.  High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
