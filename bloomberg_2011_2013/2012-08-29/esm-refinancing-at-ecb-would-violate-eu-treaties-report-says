The rulebooks for the European
Stability Mechanism and the  European Central Bank  would allow
the financial backstop to refinance itself at the central bank
even though such a step would violate the European Union’s
primary law, a German university professor said.  The future ESM is allowed to raise capital at the ECB if an
80 percent majority at its board of governors so decides, said
Hanno Kube, a professor at the University of Mainz, in a report
commissioned by the association of family-owned businesses and
 published  on its website.  The ECB is allowed to lend to “other market participants”
such as the ESM against sufficient collateral, subject to the
EU’s primary law, the report says. An ECB guideline that would
prevent the ESM at present from qualifying as a counterparty
could be changed by the ECB with a simple majority at any time,
giving the ESM access to refinancing by the ECB, Kube said.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and Italian Prime Minister
 Mario Monti , after a meeting in Berlin today, disagreed on
whether the ESM should receive a bank license as they seek to
keep  Europe ’s debt-crisis response on track. While Merkel said
that’s “not compatible with the treaties,” Monti said such an
option should “be seen in the perspective of a broad mosaic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
