The  National Hockey League  made a
fresh proposal yesterday intended to bridge the financial gulf
between team owners and players as they seek to reach agreement
on a new labor contract, Commissioner Gary Bettman said.  “We need to get on the same page on the economics,”
Bettman said on the league’s website. “We believe we’ve made a
significant, meaningful step.”  Players receive 57 percent of hockey-related revenue under
the labor agreement that expires Sept. 15. The NHL’s proposal on
July 13 called for the share to be reduced to 46 percent. On
Aug. 14, the union offered to cut its share by between $465
million and $800 million during the next three seasons,
depending on league growth.  Bettman declined to offer specifics about the latest
proposal, which  is “different in some respects” from the
previous offer, said Donald Fehr, executive director of the NHL
Players’ Association.  “I don’t want to characterize it at this stage before
we’ve had an opportunity to really go through it and make sure
we understand it and come up what we think is an appropriate
response,” Fehr said.  The union will discuss the plan before talks continue today
at the league’s office in  New York , Fehr said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
