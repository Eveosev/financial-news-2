South Africa hasn’t determined the
cost and affordability of its program to build nuclear power
plants, Deputy President  Kgalema Motlanthe  said.  “This is a work in progress,” Motlanthe, who heads a
government committee overseeing the nuclear plan, told reporters
in Cape Town today. “I’m unable to say by such a date tenders
will go out.”  South Africa plans to add 9,600 megawatts of nuclear power
capacity by 2029 to reduce its dependence on coal, the source of
more than 90 percent of the nations electricity. The National
Treasury said in February a 300 billion-rand ($36 billion)
nuclear program was in the final stages of consideration.  Areva SA,  EDF SA (EDF) ,  Toshiba Corp. (6502) ’s Westinghouse Electric
Corp. unit, China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holding Corp.,  Korea
Electric Power Corp. (KEP)  and Rosatom Corp. have all expressed
interest in building the new power stations.  Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., South Africa’s state-owned
electricity utility, currently operates Africa’s only nuclear
power plant at Koeberg, near  Cape Town . The plant began
operating in 1984 and supplies about 5 percent of the nation’s
power.  There will be a role for Eskom in the construction of the
nuclear power plants, Motlanthe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
