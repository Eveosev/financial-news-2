Tunisia’s state grains office
purchased 150,000 metric tons of optional-origin milling wheat,
according to two traders with direct knowledge of the tender.  The office bought six 25,000-ton cargoes of the grain at
$329 to $344.73 a ton for delivery from Oct. 10, said
the traders, who declined to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media.  To contact the reporter on this story:
