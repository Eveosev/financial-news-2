Oil fell after U.S. crude stockpiles
unexpectedly gained and Hurricane Isaac made landfall, reducing
the threat to offshore platforms and rigs in the  Gulf of Mexico .  Futures dropped 0.9 percent as the Energy Department said
 stockpiles  increased 3.78 million barrels to 364.5 million.
Supplies were forecast to decrease 1.75 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories declined to a three-month low. Isaac, which
shut refineries and production facilities, struck the Louisiana
coast as a hurricane before weakening to a tropical storm.  “We moved lower on the inventory gain,” said Marshall Berol, co-portfolio manager of the Encompass Fund in  San
Francisco , which has about $300 million in assets. “We’re now
focused on Isaac. We’re now going to be concentrating on how
soon things will return to normal.”  Crude oil for October delivery declined 84 cents to settle
at $95.49 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
have fallen 3.4 percent this year.  Gasoline for September delivery decreased 2.58 cents, or
0.8 percent, to settle at $3.1003 a gallon in  New York . Prices
rose to $3.1548 on Aug. 27, the highest close since April 30, as
U.S.  Gulf Coast  refineries shut with the approach of Isaac and a
fire in  Venezuela  closed the Amuay refinery, the nation’s
largest.  Fuel Stockpiles  Gasoline inventories fell 1.51 million barrels to 201.2
million last week, the department said. Stockpiles were forecast
to drop 1.45 million barrels, according to the median of 12
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, increased 873,000 barrels to 126.1
million. Stockpiles were projected to climb 200,000 barrels.  Refineries operated at 91.2 percent of capacity, unchanged
from the prior week, the report showed. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast a 0.3 percentage point decline.  “This market doesn’t want for headlines between Isaac and
Amuay,” said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group Inc., a
consulting firm in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “We’re now waiting
see what impact Isaac will have on the refineries and how long
it will take them to restart.”  Crude oil supplies on the Gulf Coast, known as Padd 3,
climbed 3.18 million barrels to 181.4 million in the week ended
Aug. 24, according to the department.  Rising Imports  Imports of crude oil rose 1.29 million barrels a day to 9.5
million last week, the report showed. It was the biggest one-
week gain since December. Imports in Padd 3 surged 23 percent to
4.98 million barrels a day.  “You had a crude build of over 3 million in Padd 3,” said
 David Pursell , a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
LLC in Houston. “It might have been imports getting in ahead of
the storm.”  Isaac was a tropical storm with top winds of 70 miles (113
kilometers) an hour as it moved northwest at 6 mph, the  National
Hurricane Center  said at 2 p.m. local time. It was 50 miles
west-southwest of  New Orleans , the center said. The storm is
still causing life-threatening storm surges and inland flooding,
according to the center.  Companies halted 95 percent of oil  production  in the Gulf
of Mexico and 72 percent of natural-gas output as Isaac neared
the Louisiana coast, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement said. Six Louisiana refineries were shut and three
were running at reduced rates, idling 6.7 percent of U.S.
capacity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Looking Ahead  “Next week’s inventory data will be messed up because of
all the hurricane-related disruptions on the Gulf,” said
 Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester,  Massachusetts .  The U.S. tapped its Strategic Petroleum Reserve after
 Hurricane Katrina  halted production in the Gulf and knocked out
eight refineries because of flooding or power loss when it came
ashore in 2005.  “The prospect of a Strategic Petroleum Reserve release is
weighing on the market,” said Tom Essaye, president of Kinsale
Trading in  Palm Beach ,  Florida . “There’s been a lot of
jawboning about making sure the market is well supplied and that
has traders nervous.”  The Group of Seven said yesterday that it’s prepared to
call upon the  International Energy Agency , a 28-member group of
oil-consuming countries, “to take appropriate action to ensure
that the market is fully and timely supplied.” The IEA’s
members made available 60 million barrels of crude and oil
products in June 2011 after Libyan output was disrupted by an
armed uprising against  Muammar Qaddafi .  Brent Oil  Brent oil for October settlement fell 4 cents to end the
session at $112.54 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark grade’s  premium  to West
Texas Intermediate oil traded in New York widened to $17.05 from
$16.25 yesterday.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 306,810
contracts as of 3:43 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 381,250
contracts yesterday, the lowest level since July 26 and 30
percent below the three-month average. Open interest was 1.51
million, the most since May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
