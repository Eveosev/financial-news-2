China  will ensure equal access to
education for children of migrant workers and those who are
disabled, orphaned or homeless, according to a statement on the
central government’s website.  The government will boost educational spending on rural
areas, poor regions or under-privileged sectors, according to
the statement, which cited decisions made at a meeting chaired
by Premier  Wen Jiabao . Provincial governments should provide
sufficient teaching resources for rural schools and improve
students’ living conditions, the government said.  “There are gaps in the quality of schooling and education
across regions and between cities and the countryside,” the
government said in the statement. “We need to make a major task
promoting balanced development.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
