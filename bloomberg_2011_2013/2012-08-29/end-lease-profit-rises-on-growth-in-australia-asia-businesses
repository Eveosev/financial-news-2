Lend Lease Group (LLC) ,  Australia ’s
largest property developer, reported a 1.7 percent increase in
full-year profit on higher earnings from its Australian and
Asian businesses, sending shares to the highest level in a year.  Net income  rose to A$501.4 million ($518.8 million) in the
12 months ended June 30, compared with A$492.8 million a year
earlier, the Sydney-based company said in a statement to the
Australian stock exchange. Operating earnings climbed to A$507.2
million from A$485.3 million.  The shares jumped 2.1 percent to A$8.36 as of 10:16 a.m. in
Sydney, the highest since September 2011. That extended gains
since it announced tenants for its Sydney financial precinct on
June 22 to 15 percent, compared with a 7.1 percent increase in
the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  Lend Lease in June said  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and KPMG LLP
will take space in the first two towers at its Barangaroo
redevelopment in Sydney’s city center, and on July 8 said it had
secured A$2 billion in funding for the project. The group is
also in exclusive talks with billionaire  James Packer ’s  Crown
Ltd. (CWN)  to build a six-star resort on the site, it said this month.  “The group’s continued earnings growth during 2012, which
was and currently remains a challenging environment,
demonstrates that we are pursuing the right strategy,” Lend
Lease Chief Executive Officer Steve McCann said in the
statement. “Successfully executing and delivering our extensive
pipeline will be a key driver of earnings in the medium term.”  Profit after tax from its Australian business rose 53
percent to A$429.9 million, while income from its Asian division
surged to A$106.2 million from A$46.1 million a year earlier.  The company will pay a full-year dividend of 38 Australian
cents, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
