Bank of America Corp. , the second-
largest U.S. lender by assets, said updated figures show it has
completed about $8.1 billion in homeowner relief under a
nationwide settlement of foreclosure abuses.  The bank had $5.8 billion in short sales completed as of
Aug. 21, $596 million in first-lien loan modifications finished
and $1.7 billion in forgiveness on home-equity lines of credit,
according to  Dan Frahm , a spokesman for the  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based  company .  Data released today by the Office of Mortgage Settlement
Oversight showed the firm had $4.9 billion in relief closed as
of June 30, almost all of it attributed to short sales. That
figure was contained in a report from Joseph A. Smith, the
monitor assigned to police the settlement reached in February by
the nation’s biggest  home lenders  with regulators and state
attorneys general.  “You are seeing a faster start on short sales completed
under the agreement because that didn’t require a new process to
be built, compared to first-lien modifications and the refinance
program,” Frahm said. Eventually, most of the credits for Bank
of America will be loan modifications, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
