The  European Central Bank  should be
more transparent in its decision making, Governing Council
member Erkki Liikanen told the newspaper Aamulehti.  “As experience is accumulated, there will probably be a
time when we consider more carefully what is public information
and what isn’t,” Liikanen told Tampere, Finland-based Aamulehti
in an interview. “That means more information becoming public
significantly sooner than currently.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB keeps minutes of its meetings and
voting by Governing Council members confidential for 30 years,
unlike the  Federal Reserve , which publishes minutes three weeks
after its meetings. The  Bank of England  and Sweden’s Riksbank
also disclose voting records after setting  interest rates .  Thirty years “is a long time,” Liikanen, who also heads
the Bank of Finland in Helsinki, told Aamulehti. “I’m not at
all worried about changing this as long as we ensure that some
part of the debate before decisions are taken remains
confidential.”  There are signs  Europe ’s debt crisis may be restarting
through the banking system, Liikanen said, according to
Aamulehti. While each country must take care of its public
finances, governments must work together to support each other
until the financial markets recognize the structural changes
that are taking place, he said.  “When all this is done, the ECB can independently consider
whether it will participate,” Liikanen said. “It can’t happen
the other way around.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
