Contec Holdings Ltd., the cable-box
repair company owned by Bain Capital LLC, sought  bankruptcy
protection  from creditors.  Contec Holdings, based in Schenectady, New York, listed
debt of as much as $500 million and assets of as much as $100
million in Chapter 11 documents filed yesterday in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Wilmington, Delaware.  “This reorganization process will allow Contec to invest
in and enhance our capabilities to serve our cable industry
customers,” Wes Hoffman, Contec chief operating officer, said
yesterday in a statement.  U.S. Republican presidential nominee  Mitt Romney  co-founded
Bain in 1984. Romney left Bain in 1999 to oversee the Salt Lake
City Olympics and served as governor of Massachusetts from 2003
to 2007. Bain acquired Contec in 2008 from  American Capital Ltd. (ACAS) , 
a Bethesda, Maryland-based asset manager, which said at the time
that it made $120 million from its two-year investment in
Contec, including dividends and profit from the sale.  Contec, founded in 1978, repairs millions of digital cable
set-top units, modems and satellite receivers each year,
according to its  website . It has repair plants in Schenectady,
Seattle, Mexico City and Matamoros, Mexico, where it opened a
240,000-square-foot facility in January 2009.  Bain, a Boston-based private-equity firm that manages  $65
billion  in assets, has invested in companies such as Toys “R”
Us Inc. and  Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. (DNKN)   CHL Ltd. (CHL) , Contec LLC, Contec Licenses LLC, WorldWide
Digital Company LLC, Contec de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V.,
Ensambladora de Matamoros S. de R.L. de C.V., and Contec
Acquisition Corp. also sought protection.  The case is In re CHL Ltd., 12-12437, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
