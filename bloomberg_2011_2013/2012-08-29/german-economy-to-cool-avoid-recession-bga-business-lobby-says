Germany  faces a cooling economy, not
a recession, as the euro region’s sovereign debt crisis hurts
business sentiment, the BGA business association, which
represents exporters, wholesalers and services companies, said
today in an e-mailed statement.  “We won’t fall off a cliff, 2009 won’t repeat itself,”
BGA president Anton Boerner said in a speech prepared for
delivery in Berlin today. The economy will expand at a
“flatter” trajectory without falling into a recession, he
said.  German services companies will increase sales by 2 percent
to 721 billion euros ($904 billion) this year and expand by
around 2.25 percent to 737 billion euros in 2013, the BGA said,
citing its own forecast together with the Creditreform credit-
rating company. That outlook is based on economic growth of 0.8
percent in 2012 and an expansion “just above” 1 percent next
year, the BGA said.  German economic growth slowed to 0.3 percent in the second
quarter from 0.5 percent in the first as the debt crisis damped
demand for exports and prompted companies to postpone
investments. While sales to faster-growing markets outside
 Europe  and domestic spending are helping to insulate Germany
from the turmoil, the Bundesbank said last week that the
prevailing uncertainty may cause the economy to cool further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
