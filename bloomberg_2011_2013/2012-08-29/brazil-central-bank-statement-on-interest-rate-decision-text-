Following is a translation of the
statement by  Brazil ’s central bank on its interest rate decision
today.  “The Copom decided, unanimously, to reduce the Selic rate
to 7.5 percent p.a., without a bias.  Considering the cumulative and delayed effect of policy
action implemented until now, which are partially reflected in
the ongoing economic recovery, the Copom considers that if the
prospective scenario were to allow for an additional adjustment
in the monetary conditions, this move should be carried out with
maximum parsimony.  Voting in favor of the reduction in the Selic rate to 7.5
percent are the following board members: President Alexandre
Antonio Tombini, Aldo Luiz Mendes,  Altamir Lopes , Anthero de
Moraes Meirelles, Carlos Hamilton Vasconcelos Araujo, Luiz Awazu
Pereira da Silva, Luiz Edson Feltrim and Sidnei Correa
Marques.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
