Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the Japanese
electronics company, plans to form a U.S. unit to finance
commercial solar projects in  North America .  Panasonic Eco Solutions North America, a separate unit the
Osaka-based company formed in April, will build and operate the
projects and Coronal Management LLC will manage the funding
company, Jamie Evans, Eco Solutions’s director of project
finance, said in an interview yesterday.  The electronics company’s backing will give potential
customers confidence in the solar venture’s ability to provide
funding and operate  power plants , he said.  “For customers and investors there is the comfort of
working with a 94 year-old” company with a strong balance
sheet, Evans said. “We can remove some of the complexity
involved in working with smaller companies.”  The company expects to develop “several projects” a year,
he said, without providing specific targets. It will give
preference to using Panasonic solar panels and will use panels
from other suppliers when it makes sense “from a size and cost
perspective.”  Panasonic said in July that it’s cutting output of solar
panels at its plant in Hungary before opening a new plant in
Malaysia in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
