The ruble weakened for a second day
as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, declined and demand for
foreign currency increased as investors sought to convert
domestic dividend payments.  Russia’s currency depreciated 0.5 percent against the
dollar to 32.1750 at 7 p.m. in Moscow, the weakest level since
Aug. 3. It slipped 0.2 percent versus the euro to 40.3150,
leaving it 0.3 percent lower against the central bank’s currency
basket. The ruble strengthened 0.7 percent against the dollar
last week as companies snapped up the currency to pay taxes.  “The tax payments, ended yesterday, supported the ruble
but it smashed against the strong purchase of U.S. dollars
partly due to conversion of dividends that non-residents
received from a number of large Russian companies,” Dmitry Polevoy, a Moscow-based economist at ING Groep NV, said by e-
mail.  Brent crude  slid less than 0.1 percent to $112.50 a barrel.
Russian companies paid about 400 billion rubles ($12.4 billion)
this week in taxes, Polevoy said. The domestic market began to
close ruble positions following the payments as well as in
anticipation of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s
speech at the end of the week, he said.  The Russian Finance Ministry today sold 2.6 billion rubles)
of five-year so-called OFZ bonds, below the planned 10 billion
rubles, at a yield of 7.57 percent. The amount was the least at
an auction since November 2011, according to Finance Ministry
data.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell six basis points to 219,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by Micex rose more
than 5 basis points to 7.66 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
