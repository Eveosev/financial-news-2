Bouygues SA (EN)  Chief Executive Officer
Martin Bouygues put his 62.5-meter yacht on sale with a price
tag of 67.5 million euros ($85 million),  Challenges  reported,
without citing anyone.  The “ Baton Rouge ” was built by Dutch shipbuilder Icon
Yachts in September 2010, the magazine said in an e-mail.  A Bouygues official declined to comment when contacted by
 Bloomberg News . The luxury vessel can accommodate 14 guests and
a crew of 16, according to Burgessyachts.com.  The CEO and his family hold 21 percent of the Paris-based
building, television and telecommunications company, according
to Bloomberg data. Bouygues shares have  declined  18 percent this
year, trimming the market value to 6.3 billion euros.  Bouygues said yesterday that first-half operating profit
fell 37 percent from a year earlier to 476 million euros as it
lost mobile-phone customers and cut prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
