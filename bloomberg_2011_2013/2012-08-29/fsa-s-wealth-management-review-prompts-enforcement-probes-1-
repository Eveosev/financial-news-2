The Financial Services Authority’s
push to ensure wealth-management services were responsibly sold
to retail clients has resulted in enforcement probes, the  U.K.
regulator  said.  Wealth-management firms “can expect to see continuing and
increasing supervisory focus,” the FSA said in a notice on its
website today. The regulator had said it became concerned with
the “unacceptable risk” for clients.  The FSA wrote letters in 2011 to chief executive officers
at firms that provide wealth-management advice to retail
investors after identifying “widespread failings” in the
sector. The agency will decide if further regulatory action is
needed after interviewing executives at the firms.  The FSA occasionally sends out so-called Dear CEO letters
to communicate regulatory concerns it has with senior management
at companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
