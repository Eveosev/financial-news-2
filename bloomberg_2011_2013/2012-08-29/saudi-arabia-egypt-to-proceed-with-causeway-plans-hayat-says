Saudi Arabia  and  Egypt  are going
ahead with plans to build a causeway that will link the two
countries at an estimated cost of $3 billion, al-Hayat reported,
citing Egyptian Transportation Minister Mohammed Rashad.  A technical committee will meet in late September to
discuss the causeway, the pan-Arab daily  said . While political
will was the projectâ€™s major obstacle in the past, it is no
longer an issue now that Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi
discussed the Red Sea link with Saudi King Abdullah during his
recent visit to Saudi Arabia, the London-based newspaper cited
Rashad as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
