Hungarian household  mortgage rates 
are set to drop and demand for credit will probably rise as a
result of state interest-rate subsidies on housing loans, the
central bank said in a quarterly lending  survey  published today.  An expected decline in annual  interest rates  on subsidized
mortgages to around 9 percent from the current 13 percent may
“stimulate demand, resulting in a tangible but not significant
boost in lending,” according to the survey.  Hungary’s government has offered interest-rate subsidies on
consumer mortgages as it seeks to prop up the real estate market
and household lending. The nation’s  economy  is mired in its
second recession in four years as domestic consumption
collapsed, corporate lending nosedived and the euro-area crisis
sapped demand for exports.  Loans to households that are more than 90 days overdue rose
to 16.3 percent by the end of the second quarter from 14.9
percent in the previous three months, the central bank said.  Corporate credit conditions will tighten further in the
second part of the year as banks’ willingness to lend declines
because of the “unfavorable economic outlook,” according to
the report. The economy may face a credit clump as corporate
lending declines, the central bank warned in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
