Citigroup Inc. (C)  raised a $412.7
million collateralized loan obligation for Columbia Management
Investment Advisers LLC, according to two people with knowledge
of the transaction.  The fund includes a $245.5 million slice rated AAA that has
a coupon of 147 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the terms are private. Libor is the rate at which banks
say they can borrow in dollars from each other.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  Scott Helfman, a Citigroup spokesman, declined to comment,
as did Charlie Keller, a Columbia spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
