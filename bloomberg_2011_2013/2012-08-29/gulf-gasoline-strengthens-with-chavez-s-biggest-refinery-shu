U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline
strengthened as Venezuela conducts an inspection of its biggest
refinery after an explosion Aug. 25 and fire that was
extinguished yesterday.  State-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA continues to export
oil and petroleum products stored at the Amuay refinery’s dock
and sees no disruption to its internal or external shipping
obligations, Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  told reporters
yesterday in Falcon state near the plant. The plant, which has
the capacity to process 645,000 barrels a day, is part of the
Paraguana complex 240 miles west of Caracas.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast rose 1.5 cents to 14 cents a gallon versus October
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:02
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
slipped 0.04 cent to $3.0579 a gallon.  The differential for ultra-low-sulfur diesel at the hub
narrowed 0.2 cent to 9.75 cents a gallon over Nymex heating oil
futures. It’s the second straight drop for the fuel.  Production at Amuay may restart in two to three days, Jesus
Luongo, head of the Paraguana refining complex said on state
television yesterday.  Venezuelan product imports from the U.S. have increased,
nearly doubling in the first five months of 2012 to 38,000
barrels a day from 23,000 in the year earlier period, according
to the EIA.  The explosion on Aug. 25 killed 48 people. President  Hugo
Chavez , who faces elections in October, declared three days of
mourning and ordered an investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
