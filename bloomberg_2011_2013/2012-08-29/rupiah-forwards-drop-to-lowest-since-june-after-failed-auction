Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards dropped
to the lowest level in almost three months and the currency
declined after a government debt auction failed to meet its
target.  The contracts fell for a fourth day after the  Finance
Ministry  sold 3.84 trillion rupiah ($401 million) of securities
yesterday, short of its 6 trillion-rupiah goal, with investors
bidding for 1.4 times the amount offered, a statement on the
debt management office’s website shows. That compares with the
previous five sales where the amounts sold exceeded targets and
investors bid for an average of 3 times the amount offered.  “The result was below target and bids were disappointing,
adding to negative sentiment for Indonesia,” said Nurul Eti
Nurbaeti, the Jakarta-based head of treasury research at PT Bank
Negara Indonesia. “The forwards reflect market expectations
that the rupiah will weaken due to the widening current-account
deficit, which will limit the supply of dollars.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.4 percent
to 10,209 per dollar as of 3:24 p.m. in Jakarta, the weakest
level since June 1, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Forwards
are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date.
Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 9,568 per dollar, according
to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
reached 9,578 earlier, the lowest level since May 31. One-month
implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to
price options, climbed 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage
point, to 7.25 percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.21
percent, the highest level since June 28, according to prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
