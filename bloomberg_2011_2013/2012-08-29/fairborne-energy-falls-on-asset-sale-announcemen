Fairborne Energy Ltd. (FEL) , the oil and
natural-gas producer that has hired advisers to seek a buyer,
fell the most in more than three years after agreeing to sell
assets in Alberta.  Fairborne, based in Calgary, dropped 11 percent to C$1.33
at the close in Toronto, the biggest decline since Feb. 20,
2009. The shares are down 55 percent this year.  Fairborne agreed to sell its Marlboro and Clive gas assets
to an unidentified buyer for C$189 million ($191 million), the
company said in a statement released after the close of regular
trading in North America yesterday. Funds from the sale will be
used to “virtually eliminate” company debt, Fairborne said.  The sale price was “slightly negative,” Ray Kwan, a
Calgary-based research analyst for Macquarie Capital Markets
Canada Ltd., wrote in a note to clients today. The market is
“saturated” with oil and gas assets for sale, making it
difficult for gas-weighted production and reserves to fetch
attractive prices, Kwan said.  Fairborne said March 15 that it had begun a strategic
review, including the option of selling the company. Fairborne
hired FirstEnergy Capital Corp. and RBC Capital Markets as
advisers the following month.  Steven VanSickle, Fairborne’s chief executive officer,
didn’t immediately respond to a voicemail message seeking
comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
