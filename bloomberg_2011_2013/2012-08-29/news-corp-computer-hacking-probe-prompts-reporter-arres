U.K. police probing computer hacking
and voice-mail interception by  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s British
newspapers arrested two ex-employees suspected in separate
conspiracies related to the use of stolen information.  London police investigating computer hacking at News
Corp.’s Times newspaper arrested a 28-year-old journalist on
suspicion of illegally accessing e-mail and conspiring to
“pervert the course of justice,” the  Metropolitan Police
Service  said today in a statement, without identifying him.  In Glasgow, police probing phone hacking at the New York-
based company’s now-defunct News of the World tabloid charged
former Scotland editor Bob Bird, 56, for allegedly perverting
the course of justice in a 2006 defamation trial. In that
case, former lawmaker Tommy Sheridan sued the publisher over a
story alleging he was involved in a sex scandal.  “The phone-hacking scandal could be eclipsed by  Rupert
Murdoch ’s unexploded bomb of computer hacking,” Labour Party
lawmaker  Tom Watson , who sat on a committee probing News Corp.,
said in an e-mail today. “It’s infecting all his U.K. titles
already and the investigation has only really just begun.”  The first journalist, identified by  Sky News  as former
Times reporter Patrick Foster, is being questioned at a North
London police station about a 2009 article that included the
name of a previously anonymous blogger.  The Times was sued in April by former police blogger
 Richard Horton  for hacking into his e-mail account in 2009 and
identifying him. Before the computer-hacking probe, the Times
had escaped the fallout from the phone-hacking scandal at the
News of the World and the related bribery investigation at
Murdoch’s best-selling Sun title. Dozens of people have been
arrested.  Foster accessed Horton’s e-mail to expose him as the writer
of the unauthorized “Nightjack” blog about police work, Times
editor  James Harding  told a media-ethics inquiry in February.
The newspaper “regretted the intrusion,” Harding said at the
time.  Legitimate Deduction  The Times also misled the judge who oversaw Horton’s failed
2009 lawsuit to block publication of his name, Harding said at
the inquiry. The publisher won by claiming it deduced he was the
blog’s author through legitimate means, even though the Times
was aware of the reporter’s hacking.  Mary Kearney, a spokeswoman for News Corp.’s U.K. unit,
News International, declined to comment.  Foster is now a freelance reporter for the  Guardian
newspaper , which broke the phone-hacking story. Guardian
spokeswoman Christine Crowther declined to comment other than to
say Foster hadn’t written a story for the title since January.  In the Scottish probe, Bird told the British Broadcasting
Corp. after his release that he will deny the charge. Glasgow
police arrested another former News of the World Scotland
editor, Douglas Wight, on Aug. 17 and charged him with
conspiring to intercept voice mail and perjuring himself in a
2010 criminal trial stemming from Sheridan’s 2006 lawsuit.  In the 2010 trial, Sheridan was found guilty of perjuring
himself during the earlier defamation case.  Andy Coulson , a past editor of the News of the World and
Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s former press chief, was arrested
on May 30 by Glasgow police on suspicion of perjury in the
same trial. Coulson was charged in the broader phone-hacking
probe by London police and appeared in court earlier this month
for the first time in that case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
