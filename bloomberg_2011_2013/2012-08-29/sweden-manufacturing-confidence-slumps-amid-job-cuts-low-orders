Swedish manufacturing confidence
slumped in August amid slowing domestic orders and falling
employment.  A  manufacturing confidence  index fell to minus 9 from a
revised minus 3, the Stockholm-based National  Institute of
Economic Research  said today. It was estimated at minus 2 in a
Bloomberg survey. The  consumer confidence  index fell to 5.4 from
5.6 the previous month. Economists predicted confidence would
rise to 5.7, according to the median of 12 forecasts.  “New orders from the domestic market fell, while new
export orders and output volume remained almost unchanged,” the
NIER said. “Employment fell somewhat and plans for the next few
months indicate further cuts. Output volume is forecast to
increase somewhat.”  The Swedish government on Aug. 24 cut its economic forecast
for next year to 2.7 percent as  Europe ’s debt crisis erodes
demand for exports. The central bank will lower its  main lending
rate  to 1 percent this year from 1.5 percent to stimulate
demand, SEB AB predicted in a report published yesterday.  Sweden , which relies on sales abroad for about half of its
output, sends 70 percent of its  exports  to Europe where
countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain are forced to rein in
spending to cut public deficits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
