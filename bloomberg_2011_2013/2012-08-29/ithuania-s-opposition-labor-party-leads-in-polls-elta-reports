Lithuania’s opposition  Labor Party 
leads in opinion polls less than two months before a
parliamentary election, according to a survey by Prime
Consulting for the  Elta  news service.  The Labor Party had 12 percent support in an Aug. 14-21
survey, Elta said today. Two other opposition parties, the
Social Democratic Party and Order & Justice, ranked second and
third with 11 percent and 10.4 percent backing. Prime Minister
Andrius Kubilius’s Homeland Union was fourth with 9.5 percent,
the survey showed.  The poll didn’t provide a margin of error. The election is
scheduled for Oct. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
