Hong Kong   stocks  swung between gains
and losses amid concern corporate earnings are worsening and
before a report today forecast to show the U.S. economy grew at
a faster pace.  The Hang Seng Index dropped 0.1 percent to 19,798.90 as of
9:44 a.m. in Hong Kong. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
mainland companies listed in Hong Kong was little changed at
9,515.12.  The Hang Seng Index was little changed this month through
yesterday as investors awaited indications on whether policy
makers will act to counter a slowdown in the global economy. It
rose the last two months. Shares  traded  at an average 10.5 times
estimated earnings, compared with 9.4 for  China ’s Shanghai
Composite Index and 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
