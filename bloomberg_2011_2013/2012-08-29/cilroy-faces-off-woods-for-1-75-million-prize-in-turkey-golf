PGA Championship winner Rory McIlroy
and 14-time major champion Tiger Woods will take part in a
Turkish tournament in October for a top prize of $1.5 million,
Ahmet Agaoglu, head of the country’s golf federation, said.  Turk Hava Yollari AO (THYAO) , the national flag carrier also known
as Turkish Airlines, will sponsor the  tournament , Agaoglu said
at a news conference in Istanbul today.  The Turkish Airlines World Golf Final will have a budget of
$12 million, with prize money of $5.2 million, he said.  The event will be held in the Mediterranean resort of
Antalya on Oct. 9-12, and Charl Schwartzel,  Lee Westwood ,  Hunter Mahan , Matt Kuchar,  Justin Rose  and Webb Simpson will also take
