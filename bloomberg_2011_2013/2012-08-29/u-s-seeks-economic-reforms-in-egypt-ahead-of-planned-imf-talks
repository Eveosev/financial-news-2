A U.S. State Department delegation
pushed Egypt to make economic reforms in a meeting with
government officials ahead of  International Monetary Fund  talks
scheduled for next month.  The U.S. suggested reforms including bankruptcy laws,
streamlining bureaucratic processes and developing logistical
capacity in the port city of Suez,  Robert Hormats , U.S. under
secretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, told
reporters in Cairo today.  “We’ve come here to make substantial progress,” Hormats
said. “Egypt expressed a high degree of urgency about financial
support.”  Talks are scheduled to resume between Egypt and the IMF
over a loan of as much as $4.8 billion in the second week of
September, which the U.S. “is playing an active role in
mobilizing,” Hormats said.  Hormats said his team has to “do a lot of consultation
with Congress” before it can reach an agreement on U.S. debt
guarantees requested by Egyptian officials.  The delegation didn’t discuss devaluation of the Egyptian
pound or the possibility of a free trade agreement, Hormats
said.  Representatives from 48 U.S. companies will visit  Egypt 
starting Sept. 8 to evaluate private-sector opportunities,
according to Hormats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
