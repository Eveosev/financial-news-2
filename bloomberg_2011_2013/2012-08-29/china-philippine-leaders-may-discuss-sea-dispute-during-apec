Chinese President  Hu Jintao  and
Philippine President  Benigno Aquino  may hold a meeting during
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Russia next
month and they may discuss the South China Sea dispute, a
Philippine government official said today.  China requested for a meeting with Aquino and the two
leaders may also talk about economic and other issues, Foreign
Affairs Undersecretary Laura del Rosario said in a briefing in
Manila. The Philippines is studying taking its territorial
dispute to the international court, Foreign Affairs Secretary
Albert del Rosario said last month.  The Philippines will host the APEC Summit in 2015, the
foreign affairs undersecretary said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
