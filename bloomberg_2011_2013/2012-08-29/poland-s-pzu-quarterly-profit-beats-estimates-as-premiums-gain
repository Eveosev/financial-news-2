PZU SA (PZU) , Poland’s largest insurer,
said second-quarter profit climbed by a bigger-than-estimated 17
percent after boosting premiums and investment income.  Net income  rose to 894.6 million zloty ($273.3 million)
from 762.2 million zloty, the Warsaw-based company said in a
regulatory statement today. That beat the 791.3 million-zloty
average  estimate  of seven  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.  PZU may post full-year earnings at a level “similar” to
2011, Chief Executive Officer Andrzej Klesyk said on March 15.
The insurer, which reported a 3.9 percent decline in profit to
2.34 billion zloty last year amid a slump in financial markets,
is reallocating assets to corporate bonds as it bids to limit
the impact of investments on earnings.  Income from investments increased 7.6 percent to 651.1
million zloty from a year earlier, while premiums rose 5.9
percent to 3.92 billion zloty in the quarter.  First-half net income rose to 1.72 billion zloty from 1.55
billion zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
