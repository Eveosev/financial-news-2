Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , the
Serbian oil and gas company controlled by Russia’s  OAO Gazprom
Neft (GAZP) , said it will invest at least $100 million in its Novi Sad
refinery for production of base oils and lubricants.  NIS plans annual output of 180,000 tons of base oils and
lubricants as of 2015 when it expects to complete the upgrade
using technology from  Chevron Lummus Global USA , a joint venture
of  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and Netherlands-based CB&I Lummus BV, NIS Chief
Executive Officer Kirill Kravchenko told reporters in Belgrade
today. Work on the upgrade may start in 2013, pending
shareholders’ approval and a feasibility study to be completed
by the end of the year, he said.  The resource base for Novi Sad production will be crude
from its  oil fields  in Serbia’s northern Vojvodina province
“because the quality is just ideal for making base oils,”
Kravchenko said.  NIS will finance the upgrade with its own cash, said
Nikolas Petri, NIS’s chief of strategic planning. The planned
output will comprise some 75,000 tons of naphthenic oils and
105,000 tons of paraffinic oils a year, used for making tyres,
plastics, engine lubes and transformer oils.  The intended markets are mostly in southeastern  Europe 
where NIS sees “strong and stable demand” on rising industrial
usage, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
