Household debt in the U.S. declined
0.5 percent in the second quarter, led by a drop in debt tied to
real estate, according to the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York .  Consumer indebtedness shrank by $53 billion from the first
quarter to $11.38 trillion as of the end of June, according to
the quarterly report on household debt and credit released today
by the district bank. Delinquency rates for mortgages, credit
cards and  car loans  declined, while rates for student loans and
home equity lines of credit rose, the report said.  “The continuing decrease in delinquency rates suggests
that consumers are managing their debts better,” Wilbert van
Der Klaauw, a vice president and economist at the  New York  Fed,
said in a statement today. “As they continue to pay down debt
and take advantage of low  interest rates , Americans are moving
forward with rebalancing their household finances.”  Americans have cut household debt by $1.3 trillion since
the peak in the third quarter 2008 amid signs of a rebound in
the housing market at the center of the 18-month recession that
ended in June 2009, according to the report. The lowest  mortgage
rates  on record helped boost the S&P/Case-Shiller gauge of  home
prices  in 20 U.S. cities, which rose  0.5 percent  in June from a
year earlier for the first gain since September 2010.  About 256,000 consumers showed new foreclosures on their
credit reports in the second quarter, a decrease of 12 percent
since the first quarter and the lowest level since 2007, the New
York Fed’s survey showed. About 399,000 consumers had a
bankruptcy notation added to their credit reports, down 16
percent from the same quarter a year earlier, the report said.  Credit Panel  Debt from educational loans rose 1.1 percent to $914
billion in the second quarter, the report said. The loans were
taken out by students and their parents, with most backed by the
U.S. government.  Ninety-day delinquency rates for  student loans  increased to
8.9 percent from 8.7 percent in the previous quarter. Since the
peak in household debt in the third quarter of 2008, student-
loan obligations have increased by $303 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
