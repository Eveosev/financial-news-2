Boston Properties Inc. (BXP)  bought an
office project under construction in  San Francisco ’s South of
Market district from Rockwood Capital and TMG Partners as
investors scour the city for purchases.  The company’s Boston Properties LP unit paid $62.2 million
in cash and 1.59 million units of preferred stock that can be
sold for $50 each and carry an annual dividend yield of 2
percent, according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The 522,000-square-foot (48,500-square-
meter) development, located at Folsom and Hawthorne streets, is
about 85 percent pre-leased, with initial occupancy expected in
mid-2014, the Boston-based company said.  San Francisco’s office market has the best rental-growth
forecast of any U.S. city, according to Green Street Advisors
Inc., a Newport Beach, California-based research firm. Citywide
office rents jumped 28 percent in the second quarter from a year
earlier as Internet firms Airbnb Inc., Twitter Inc. and  Yelp
Inc. (YELP)  signed new leases, according to broker  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)   As part of the deal, Boston Properties Inc., the biggest
U.S. office real estate investment trust by stock-market value,
also acquired an adjacent parcel with a vacant, 22,000-square-
feet building that may be redeveloped, and assumed a $170
million construction loan commitment. No amount is outstanding
on the commitment, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
