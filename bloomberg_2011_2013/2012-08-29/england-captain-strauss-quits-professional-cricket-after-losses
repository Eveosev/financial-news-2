Andrew Strauss , who led England to
two Ashes victories and the top ranking in Test cricket, will
retire from the national team and Middlesex after a 14-year
career.  The 35-year-old will be replaced by  Alastair Cook , who is
captain of the one-day side. England lost its most recent Test
series against South Africa, which took over the top spot in the
International Cricket Council’s Test team rankings. Teammate
Kevin Pietersen was kicked off the squad after criticizing
Strauss in text messages to South African players.  “It has clearly been a tough decision to make, but I
believe that it is both in the best interests of the England
cricket team and myself to step down at this stage,” Strauss
said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
