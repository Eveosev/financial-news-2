OGX Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas Participacoes SA,
the oil company  controlled  by billionaire  Eike Batista , dropped
the most in two months after announcing the second top
management replacement since June.  OGX dropped 8.7 percent to 5.98 reais at 11:24 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, after plummeting as much as 9.2 percent, the most
intraday since June 28. The stock has fallen 55 percent this
year.  Exploration Director Paulo dos Santos is stepping down to
take a position at Batista’s EBX Group Co. holding company and
will be replaced by Paulo Guimaraes, an executive at Santos’s
department, OGX said in a statement today. The replacement
follows the departure of Paulo Mendonca as chief executive
officer in June after OGX slashed its output goal by 75 percent.  OGX will reduce investments to $1.2 billion in 2013 from
about $2 billion this year, Chief Financial Officer Roberto Monteiro said on an Aug. 15 conference call.  To contact the reporters on this story:
