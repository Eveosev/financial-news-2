The Scottish government is giving
five wave- and tidal-energy developers 7.9 million pounds ($12.5
million) to develop prototypes off the country’s coast.  The funding “is to enable Scottish developers and supply
chain firms to capture an increased share of the growing
international marine energy market,” according to a government
 statement  today. The technology may be worth as much as 4
billion pounds to the nation’s economy by 2020.  Scotrenewables Tidal Power Ltd. will receive 1.2 million
pounds toward a 9.2-million-pound project to install commercial-
scale tidal turbines. “This funding will allow us to progress
to the next stage in the development of our floating tidal
technology,” John McGlynn, the company’s business development
manager, said in the statement.  The government granted 3.9 million pounds to AWS Ocean
Energy Ltd., 1.4 million pounds to Nautricity Ltd., 750,000 to
Oceanflow Energy Ltd., and 617,000 to Albatern Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
