A body found in a Latvian forest may
be that of Leonid Rozhetskin, a Russian-born U.S. citizen and
shareholder in the London-based City A.M. newspaper,  Leta 
reported, citing the police.  The body, discovered Aug. 1 along with a  credit card 
belonging to Rozhetskin, matched DNA left at his house, where
blood stains were found after he disappeared in 2008, Leta said
today, citing Sigita Pildava, a police spokeswoman. Further DNA
tests will be needed to establish whether the body is that of
the missing man, according to the news service, which is based
in the capital, Riga.  Rozhetskin, a former shareholder in Russian mobile-phone
operator OAO MegaFon, went missing from his home in Jurmala,
 Latvia , on March 16, 2008.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Aaron Eglitis in Riga at   aeglitis@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
