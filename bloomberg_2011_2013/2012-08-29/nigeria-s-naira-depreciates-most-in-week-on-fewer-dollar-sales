Nigeria ’s naira weakened and set for
the biggest drop in week as  oil companies  and the central bank
were said to sell fewer dollars than expected.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.1 percent to 158.15 a dollar as of 2:42 p.m. in Lagos, heading
for the biggest decline since Aug. 23, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The market is still awaiting month-end sales by oil
companies to cater for rising dollar demand,” Sewa Wusu,
currency analyst at Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said in a
telephone interview today. The Central Bank of Nigeria’s
“reduced supply is adding to naira weakening,” Wusu said.  Oil-producing companies which sell dollars to lenders
around the month-end to meet local expenses are the second major
supplier after the central bank. It sells foreign currency at
twice-weekly auctions to support the naira. The central bank
sold $180 million at an auction today, less than $250 million at
the previous sale on Aug. 27, it said in an e-mailed statement.  Fuel imports have been a source of pressure on the naira,
according to the  Central Bank of Nigeria .  Yields on the West African nation’s 7 percent domestic debt
due 2019 fell 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to
15.50 percent, according to yesterday’s prices on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs on the West
African nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 gained two
basis points to 4.892 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi gained 0.4 percent to 1.9305 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
