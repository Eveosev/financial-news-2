Takehiko Nakao,  Japan ’s top currency
official said the yen’s appreciation since the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. almost four years ago was
excessive and is hampering the economy.  Japan is suffering because of the yen’s appreciation, Nakao
said in a speech at an event in London today.  “Our idea about the exchange rate is that yen is regarded
as a safe haven currency today,” Nakao said at the event,
hosted by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions
Forum. “But the Japanese economic condition is not so robust.”  The yen has surged against the dollar in the past five
years and is hovering near last year’s high, eroding the profits
of exporters including Sony Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. A few
 Bank of Japan (8301)  board members said in the minutes of their July
meeting that the central bank should not dismiss any options in
combating risks to the economy from Europe’s debt crisis.  The yen traded at 78.50 as of 9:55 a.m. in London, little
changed from yesterday. It’s just 4 percent off its postwar
record of 75.35, reached on Oct. 31, 2011. The Bank of Japan, on
behalf of the  finance ministry , sold a record 8.07 trillion yen
($100 billion) on that day to curb the currency’s appreciation.
Japan hasn’t intervened in the  currency market  since November,
according to the finance ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
