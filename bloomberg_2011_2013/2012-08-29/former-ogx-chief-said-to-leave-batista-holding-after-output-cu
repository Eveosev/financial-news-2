Paulo Mendonca, who led  Eike
Batista ’s  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes (OGXP3)  in its first oil
production projects, has left the Brazilian billionaire’s
holding company EBX Group Co., where he served as an adviser.  Batista replaced Mendonca as OGX’s chief executive in June,
after the company cut output targets by as much as 75 percent,
appointing him special adviser at EBX. Mendonca has now left the
holding company, the company’s press department said in an e-
mail late yesterday.  Mendonca didn’t answer calls seeking comment.  OGX shares  fell  the most in two months yesterday after the
second top management replacement since June. Exploration
Director Paulo dos Santos is stepping down to take a position at
EBX and will be replaced by Paulo Guimaraes, who previously
managed OGX’s Campos Basin fields, OGX said in a statement
before the opening of regular trading hours in Brazil yesterday.  OGX, based in  Rio de Janeiro ,  dropped  8.4 percent to close
at 6 reais in  Sao Paulo  yesterday, the most since June 28. The
stock has lost 56 percent this year.  Veja magazine in Sao Paulo reported Mendonca’s departure
earlier  yesterday .  To contact the reporter on this story:
