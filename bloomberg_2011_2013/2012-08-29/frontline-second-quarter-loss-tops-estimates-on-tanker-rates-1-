Frontline Ltd., the world’s largest
operator of supertankers, reached an eight-month low in Oslo
trading after forecasting deteriorating returns from carrying
oil by sea.  The shares  fell  as much as 9.5 percent to the lowest level
since Dec. 16, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg. Its
board expects a “significantly worse” operating result for the
current quarter, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company said today
in a statement. Frontline, led by billionaire  John Fredriksen ,
also had a larger-than-estimated second-quarter loss.  While stockpiling of crude helped rates rally as much as 63
percent in the year’s first four months, daily earnings averaged
$10,859 so far this quarter, heading for the lowest level since
at least 1997, according to data from Clarkson Plc, the world’s
largest shipbroker. The tanker market will stay “challenging”
after the combined fleet of very large crude carriers and
Suezmax ships almost doubled since 2004, Frontline said.  “We do not see a reason to own Frontline on the back of
the results for the second quarter and the outlook for the
second half of 2012,” Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at
Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo, said in an e-mailed note today.
He advises selling the shares.  Frontline slid 7.6 percent to 19.77 kroner by 2:22 p.m. in
Oslo, reducing the company’s market value to 1.54 billion kroner
($264.2 million). The stock reached 19.35 kroner. It’s down 22
percent this year, headed for a sixth annual drop in seven.  Analyst Estimates  The  net loss  of $11.2 million, or 14 cents a share, for the
three months through June reported by the tanker company
compared with the average of 16 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg for a $1.61 million loss. Frontline lost $35.2
million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier and had net income
of $7.18 million, or 9 cents, in 2012’s first quarter.  Daily income for the largest  oil tankers  plunged 74 percent
this year to $7,637, Clarkson data show. Earnings reached as
high as $51,413 on April 6 as  China  stockpiled the most oil
since preparing for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and U.S.
inventories reached a 22-year high. The fleet will expand 6.9
percent this year, outstripping 3.9 percent growth in cargo
demand, the London-based broker’s research unit estimates.  Frontline split in two in December to avoid running out of
cash amid the lowest rates since 1999. The company’s VLCCs
earned $31,000 a day on average last quarter in the spot and
period market, compared with $25,600 in the preceding period.
The ships, each able to hold 2 million barrels of crude, need
$23,900 to break even, according to the statement.  Second-quarter sales fell 20 percent from a year earlier to
$176.6 million. Ship operating expenses increased by $5.9
million from the preceding quarter.  Frontline said no  dividend  will be paid in respect of the
latest period. The company scrapped the payout in the fourth
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
