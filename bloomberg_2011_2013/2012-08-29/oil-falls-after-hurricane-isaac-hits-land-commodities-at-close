The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.1 percent to 668.06 by 5:24 p.m. in
London. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials was
little changed at 1,591.4069.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell after U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly gained
and Hurricane Isaac made landfall, reducing the threat to
offshore platforms and rigs in the  Gulf of Mexico .  Crude oil for October delivery declined $1.40, or 1.5
percent, to $94.93 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.
Oil traded at $95.45 a barrel before release of the inventory
report at 10:30 a.m. Futures have fallen 3.9 percent this year.  Brent oil for October settlement fell 28 cents to $112.30 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Oil markets: NI OILMARKET  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline futures fluctuated after a report showed a higher-
than-expected jump in oil inventories, indicating refinery rates
may remain elevated, and Hurricane Isaac made landfall in
 Louisiana , forcing plants to shut down.  September-delivery gasoline slipped 0.21 cent to $3.124 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after trading
between $3.0841 and $3.1362. The more actively traded October
contract sank 0.52 cent to $2.9281.  Heating oil for September delivery fell 0.45 cent to
$3.1158 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 4.8
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $3.804 gallon yesterday, the most
since March 3, 2011, AAA data showed. It’s the highest level
since April 30.  Oil Products Europe: NI OPEMKT Gasoline: NI GASOLINE Heating
oil: NI HEATOIL  NATURAL GAS  U.K. natural gas for within-day delivery pared earlier
losses as higher demand and increased imports balanced the
delivery network.  Gas for today slid 0.7 percent to 56.6 pence a therm.
September gas rallied 0.5 percent to 57.05 pence a therm,
reversing a 0.9 percent decline. That’s equivalent to $9.04 per
million British thermal units and compares with $2.62 per
million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  U.K. natural gas: NI NUKMKT Gas market: NI GASMARKET Americas

below-average rainfall may reduce output in West Africa. Cotton,
coffee and orange juice also gained, while sugar fell.  Cocoa for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to $2,583 a
metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price
reached $2,600, the highest for a most-active contract since
Nov. 10.  Cotton futures for December delivery increased 0.7 percent
to 76.15 cents a pound.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery gained 0.2

percent to $1.1725 a pound.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery slid 0.8 percent to
19.97 cents a pound.  Soft  commodities markets : NI SOMKTS  BASE METALS  Copper fell for the fourth straight session in New York,
heading for the longest slump in 12 weeks, on speculation that
the U.S. and  China  will refrain from new economic stimulus
measures, undermining demand prospects.  Copper futures for December delivery slid 0.6 percent to
$3.4485 a pound on the Comex in New York, heading for the
longest slump since June 5. Earlier, the contract reached
$3.428, the lowest since Aug. 21.  Tin plunged the most in five weeks as supply concerns eased
after PT Timah, the world’s third-largest producer, said it
began immediate-delivery sales, reversing a decision to curb
supply after less than a month. Tin for delivery in three months
dropped 3.4 percent to $20,001 a ton on the LME.  Zinc and aluminum also declined in London, while nickel
rose.  Base metals markets: NI BMMKTS  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold slumped the most in two weeks amid speculation that an
expanding U.S. economy will reduce pressure on the  Federal
Reserve  to take additional steps to spur growth, eroding demand
for the metal as an inflation hedge.  Gold futures for December delivery slid 0.6 percent to
$1,659.60 an ounce on the Comex in New York. A close at this
price will make it the biggest loss for a most-active contract
since Aug. 14.  Silver futures for December delivery declined 0.7 percent
to $30.76 an ounce in New York.  Precious metal markets: NI PCMKTS  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures rose the most in three weeks on mounting
concern that the worst U.S. drought since 1956 is forcing
livestock producers to shrink their herds to avoid high feed
costs. Hog prices fell.  Cattle futures for October delivery climbed 1 percent to
$1.2495 a pound on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange, heading for
the biggest gain since Aug. 8. Prices are up 1.9 percent this
year through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement slid 0.1
percent to $1.443 a pound in Chicago.  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.4 percent to
72.925 cents a pound on the CME. Through yesterday, the price
dropped 13 percent this year.  Livestock markets: NI LVMKTS  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Soybeans and corn rose on speculation that rain in the past
two weeks failed to boost crops after the worst drought since
1956 cut yields.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$17.315 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, heading for a
second straight gain.  Corn futures for December delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
$8.025 a bushel on the CBOT. A close at that price would snap a
five-session decline, the longest slide since June 2011.  Grain markets: NI GRMKTS  EUROPEAN CARBON PERMITS  European Union carbon for December declined 3.8 percent to
7.68 euros ($9.63) on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  EU Carbon Emissions: NI ECBMKT  To contact the reporter on this story:
