Killings in eastern  Democratic
Republic  of Congo committed by three rebel groups may constitute
crimes against humanity, United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights Navi Pillay said.  Pillay’s office and the UN’s peacekeeping mission in Congo
have documented more than 45 attacks on 30 villages in North
Kivu province’s Masisi territory since May, the agencies said
yesterday in a joint  statement  from Geneva.  “Allegations of hundreds of killings are still being
verified,” Pillay said, according to the statement posted on
the website of her office. “The sheer viciousness of these
murders is beyond comprehension. In some cases, the attacks
against civilians may constitute crimes against humanity.”  Congo is struggling to control worsening violence in its
eastern provinces since hundreds of soldiers deserted the army
and created a rebel group known as M23 in April. Battles between
the M23 and the army have created a “security vacuum”
throughout the region, allowing other rebel groups to flourish,
according to the statement.  Rwandan ethnic-Hutu rebels known as the Democratic Forces
for the Liberation of Rwanda, or FDLR, were responsible for
several of the Masisi attacks, according to the statement. Raia
Mutomboki, a group that says it is protecting Congolese from the
FDLR, committed other atrocities, the UN said. A third armed
group, Nyatura, occasionally helped the FDLR, it said.  The insecurity in eastern Congo has displaced about half a
million people, according to the UN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
