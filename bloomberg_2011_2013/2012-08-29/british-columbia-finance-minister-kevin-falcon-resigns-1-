British Columbia’s Deputy Premier
and Finance Minister Kevin Falcon has resigned and won’t run as
a candidate in the province’s next election, according to a
 statement  today on his constituency website.  The resignation is effective immediately. He will remain a
Member of the Legislative Assembly for the riding of Surrey-
Cloverdale until the next election,  slated  for May 14, 2013.  “I have made these decisions for both personal and
practical reasons,” Falcon said in the statement. “After
almost 12 years in public life, I wish to return to the private
sector.”  Falcon is stepping aside as the popularity of the
province’s ruling Liberal Party and Premier Christy Clark slides
in public opinion polls and voter support for New Democratic
Party leader Adrian Dix rises.  Clark has asked  Shirley Bond , the province’s attorney
general, minister of public works and solicitor general, to
become acting finance minister, according to a statement on a
government  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
