Morgan Stanley was sued by  Bank
Hapoalim BM (POLI) , Israelâ€™s second-biggest bank, in  New York  state
court over $140.5 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities.  Bank Hapoalim seeks damages for claims including common-law
fraud, fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation,
according to documents filed today in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan. The bank accuses New York-based Morgan
Stanley of making material misrepresentations in the offering
materials for the investments.  Bank Hapoalim, based in Tel Aviv, has sued other banks in
the same court over mortgage-backed securities during the past
year, including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest U.S. bank by
assets, and  Bank of America Corp. , the second-biggest U.S.
lender.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  Lauren Onis, a spokeswoman for  Morgan Stanley (MS) , declined to
immediately comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Bank Hapoalim BM v. JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
653036/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
