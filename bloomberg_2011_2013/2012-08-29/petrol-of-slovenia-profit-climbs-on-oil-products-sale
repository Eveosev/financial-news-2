Petrol Group d.d. , Slovenia’s
biggest energy company, posted a 9 percent rise in first-half
net income as sales of oil products and general merchandise
increased.  Profit climbed to 23 million euros ($29 million) from the
year earlier period, the Ljubljana-based company said in a
 regulatory filing  today. Revenue surged 18 percent to 1.8
billion euros, it said.  “Earnings before interest and tax were slightly better
than we had foreseen, while profit disappointed as we expected
it would reach 26 million euros,” Saso Stanovnik, head of
research at brokerage Alta Invest d.d. in Ljubljana said in an
e-mail. He owns Petrol shares. “We still believe the company is
doing pretty well as sales of oil products gain consistently.
The company should see stable and solid profit growth in 2012.”  Petrol, which operates 457 outlets in the Balkans, is
seeing an increase in the sale of oil products, electricity and
general merchandise even as the economies of Slovenia and
 Croatia , its main markets, stagnate and consumption falters amid
rising unemployment.  Sales of oil products in the period totaled 1.2 million
tones, a 9 percent rise from a year earlier period and sales of
electricity soared 121 percent to 1.1 million mega-watt hours.
Sales of merchandise other than oil products increased 10
percent to 236.5 million euros, the Slovenian company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
