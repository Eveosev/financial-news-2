CIC Insurance Group Ltd. (CIC) , Kenya’s
second-biggest insurer by premiums, reversed an earlier gain to
close at the lowest since its listing last month.  Shares declined 1.3 percent to close at 3.90 shillings in
Nairobi, after having advanced by the same amount. The stock was
listed on July 18 with a debut price of 3.5 shillings and closed
that day at a price of 5.25 shillings.  The insurer’s 14-day  relative strength index  closed at 28.9
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A level
below 30 signals to some technical analysts that the stock is
oversold and set for a rise. The RSI was 28 today.  Total insurance premiums in Kenya rose to 90.6 billion
shillings ($1.01 billion) in 2011 from 79.1 billion shillings a
year earlier, Business Daily said yesterday, citing the
Association of  Kenya  Insurers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
