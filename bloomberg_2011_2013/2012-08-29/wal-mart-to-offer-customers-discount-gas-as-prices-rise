Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, will offer holders of its proprietary credit
and debit cards discounted gasoline to attract budget-conscious
consumers seeking relief from rising fuel prices.  Holders of Wal-Mart credit cards and its MoneyCard prepaid
debit cards will get a 15-cent-per-gallon discount at any of the
1,026 locations that sell gasoline in 20 states, the
Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said today in a statement.
Wal-Mart gift card holders will get a 10-cent discount per
gallon. The program runs from Aug. 31 to Dec. 24.  Wal-Mart is seeking increased traffic to its stores after a
similar program last year attracted shoppers, Chief
Merchandising Officer Duncan Mac Naughton said on a conference
call. The average U.S. price of a gallon of regular unleaded
 gasoline  has risen 16 percent this year to $3.80 yesterday,
according to AAA.  “Our customers are under pressure from the economy,” Mac
Naughton said. “They also talk about gas prices. We have always
had aggressive prices on gas. This takes it to the next level.”  Wal-Mart rose 0.8 percent to $72.96 at 11:06 a.m. in  New
York . The  shares  gained 21 percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
