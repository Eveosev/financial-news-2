The U.S. strategic pivot toward the
Asia-Pacific is not targeted at China, U.S. Pacific Commander
Admiral Samuel Locklear said at a meeting with a senior Chinese
military official.  The U.S. wants to strengthen cooperation with China in the
region, Locklear said at the meeting in  Hawaii  yesterday with
Cai Yingting, the People’s Liberation Army deputy chief of the
General Staff, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency.  Cai said the two countries’ militaries should “deepen
pragmatic cooperation,” Xinhua said. The two countries’
conflicts should be handled “with foresight,” Cai said,
according to Xinhua.  After U.S. President  Barack Obama  spelled out a new U.S.
strategy toward the Asia-Pacific in November, China in March
said it would increase its defense spending 11.2 percent to
about 670 billion  yuan  ($106.4 billion). The Pentagon’s proposed
2013 budget was $525 billion.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
