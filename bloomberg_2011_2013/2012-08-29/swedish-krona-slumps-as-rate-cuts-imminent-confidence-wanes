Sweden’s krona slumped to a four-
week low against the euro after the country’s National Institute
of  Economic Research  predicted the central bank would need to
lower  interest rates  to 1 percent this year.  Sweden’s central bank will cut its main  lending rate  to
support an expansion, the institute said today. The krona
weakened the most in more than seven weeks against the dollar as
a separate report from the institute showed its Swedish
manufacturing  confidence index  fell to minus 9 in August from a
revised minus 3 the previous month. A gauge of consumer
 confidence  fell to 5.4 from 5.6 in July, the NIER said.
Economists predicted confidence would rise to 5.7, according to
the median of 12 forecasts.  “We agree with the NIER that the Riksbank needs to cut
rates, and has room to do so,” said  Carl Hammer , chief foreign-
exchange strategist at SEB AB in  Stockholm . “Now that
manufacturing confidence has plummeted, the biggest worry for
the krona is a continuation of worse than anticipated data.”  The krona fell 0.5 percent to 8.3435 per euro as of 3:21
p.m. in  London , after dropping to 8.3715, the weakest level
since Aug. 1. The Swedish currency slid 0.8 percent to 6.6636
per dollar, after tumbling by as much as 1 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since July 6.  The Riksbank will keep its repurchase rate at 1 percent
next year, compared with the current rate of 1.50 percent, NIER
said. It will return the rate to 1.50 percent by the end of
2014, the institute predicted. Policy makers at the Swedish
central bank will announce an interest-rate decision on Sept. 6.  The krona has appreciated 5.9 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
has declined 3 percent and the euro has fallen 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
