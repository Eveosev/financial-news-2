L’Oreal SA (OR) , the world’s largest
cosmetics maker, slid the most in more than 11 months in Paris
trading after the company reported first-half profit margins
that missed analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  dropped as much as 5.2 percent to 95.80 euros,
the steepest intraday  decline  since Sept. 22, 2011, and were
down 3.7 percent as of 9:23 a.m.  Gross profit as a percentage of sales narrowed to 71
percent in the six months ended June 30 from 71.5 percent a year
earlier, the Paris-based company said yesterday after markets
closed, less than the 71.9 percent average  estimate  of four
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. L’Oreal attributed the decline
to the weakening of the euro, the consolidation of Clarisonic, a
maker of sonic skincare devices that it agreed to buy at the end
of 2011, and an increase in promotional offers.  “L’Oreal’s results came in below our expectations with
generally poor quality,”  Andrew Wood , an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, said in a note. “Especially noteworthy was the miss
on our and consensus estimates on margins.”  A 0.1 percentage point increase in the operating  margin  to
16.9 percent was also below estimates, Wood said. The profit
measure would have declined were it not for a reduction in
advertising and promotional expenditure, he said.  L’Oreal said first-half operating profit rose 11 percent to
1.9 billion euros ($2.4 billion) and repeated its target of
outperforming the global cosmetics market, which it has
estimated will grow about 4 percent this year. The company also
said it will buy back as much as 500 million euros of shares by
the end of the year that it will then cancel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
