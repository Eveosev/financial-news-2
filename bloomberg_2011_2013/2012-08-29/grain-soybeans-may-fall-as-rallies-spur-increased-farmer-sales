What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, after the largest rally in three weeks increases sales
of wheat in parts of the Midwest,  Dave Marshall , a farm
marketing adviser for Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in
Nashville, Illinois, said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
lower after prices jumped 2.3 percent today, spurring more sales
of newly harvested grain, Marshall said.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on increased farmer sales of remaining supplies of last
yearâ€™s crop and speculation that rain from Tropical Storm Isaac
may boost yields of immature Midwest crops, Marshall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
