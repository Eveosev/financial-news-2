A week-long rally in Treasuries is
set to pause after yields declined to a level that may deter
investors, according to Shin Kong Life Insurance Co., citing
trading patterns.  A  graph  of the 10-year rate from the beginning of May
through last week forms a W-shaped pattern, said Will Tseng, who
studies technical levels of Treasuries at Taipei-based Shin
Kong, which has the equivalent of $52.8 billion in assets.  The average yield in the middle of the formation is 1.62
percent and is a technical barrier that will weaken demand, he
said. Ten-year rates have fallen to 1.63 percent as of 6:32 a.m.
in  London  from as high as 1.86 percent on Aug. 21.  “If yields close within two-to-three basis points of the
technical level for the next few days, then we can say that the
bullish momentum is pausing,” Tseng said. “Yields may rise
again.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
