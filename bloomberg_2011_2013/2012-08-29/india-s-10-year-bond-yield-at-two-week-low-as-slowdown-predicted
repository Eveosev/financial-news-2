India’s 10-year bond yield held at
the lowest level in more than two weeks on speculation data due
this week will show the  economy  grew at the slowest pace since
2009, adding pressure on the central bank to cut  interest rates .  Gross domestic product expanded 5.3 percent from a year
earlier in the first three months of this year, the slowest pace
since the first quarter of 2009, and economists predict an Aug.
31 report will show the growth rate stayed at that level in the
period ended June 30. The next monetary policy review is due on
Sept. 17.  “Slowing economic growth is encouraging investors to add
to their bond holdings,” said R.S. Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief
dealer of fixed-income and currencies at  State Bank of Bikaner &
Jaipur. (SBBJ)  “There is an expectation that the central bank will
ease its policy.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 was
unchanged from yesterday at 8.18 percent in Mumbai, according to
the central bank’s trading system. That is the lowest level
since Aug. 10.  The  Reserve Bank  of India kept the repurchase  rate 
unchanged at 8 percent at a policy meeting on July 31, after
cutting it by 50 basis points in April. Prime Minister  Manmohan
Singh ’s economic panel this month cut the forecast for growth to
6.7 percent in the current fiscal year ending March 2013 from
7.6 percent predicted in February.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.78 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
