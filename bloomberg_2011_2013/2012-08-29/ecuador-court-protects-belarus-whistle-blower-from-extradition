Ecuador’s National Court of Justice
threw out an extradition request against Aliaksandr Barankov, a
Belarusian whistle-blower who sought refuge in Ecuador in 2009,
allowing him to stay on in the South American country.  Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko’s government had
sought Barankov’s extradition on fraud accusations after he
published documents alleging corruption in oil sales by family
members and officials in Lukashenko’s administration, Ecuador
said in a statement published late yesterday in the president’s
official gazette.  To contact the reporter on this story:
