Three-time champion  Kim Clijsters 
lost in the second round of the U.S. Open tennis tournament
today to  England ’s Laura Robson, ending the career of the 29-
year-old Belgian.  Clijsters, seeded 23rd and playing in her 163rd Grand Slam
singles match, lost 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-5) to the 18-year-old
Robson, who was playing in her 10th Grand Slam match and had
never before reached the third round of a major tennis
tournament.  Clijsters has said this was her final tournament before
retirement.  Clijsters had won 22 straight matches at the U.S. Open and
hadn’t lost at the tournament since 2003. She won the title in
2005, 2009 and 2010 and skipped the other years because of
injuries and a two-year break to have a child.  Chris Evert , who won 31 U.S. Open matches in a row between
1975 and 1979, is the only woman with a longer streak than
Clijsters since professionals were permitted to enter major
championships in 1968.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
