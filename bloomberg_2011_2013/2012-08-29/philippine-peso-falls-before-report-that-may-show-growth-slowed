The Philippine peso fell for a
second day and bonds advanced before a government report that
economists predict will show economic growth slowed last quarter.  Gross domestic product  rose 5.5 percent in the three months
through June, according to the median estimate of 17 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey before tomorrow’s report due at 10
a.m. The $225 billion economy expanded 6.4 percent in the first
quarter, the fastest pace in  Southeast Asia .  “There’s caution ahead of the GDP numbers and I think we
could see that exports lost some steam last quarter,” said
Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . She
projected 5.5 percent second-quarter growth.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 42.355 per dollar at the close
in  Manila , Tullett Prebon Plc prices showed. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 6.3 percent.  Bonds rose after the Bureau of the Treasury sold all the 9
billion pesos ($213 million) of 4.75 percent notes maturing in
2019 on offer yesterday. Bids totaled 24.7 billion pesos. The
yield on the 5 percent securities due April 2019 fell five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to a three-week low of 4.7
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  The government has received proposals from banks offering
to arrange a retail bond sale and a debt exchange and will gauge
investor demand for these funding exercises, Treasurer  Roberto
Tan  said yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
