Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , rose to the highest this month
after agreeing to sell its digital radio network operator unit
to a state-owned telecommunications company.  The shares increased 1.2 percent to 428 forint by 10:20
a.m. in Budapest, compared with an all-time low of 386 forint
reached on Aug. 10. The benchmark BUX stock index advanced 0.3
percent.  Magyar Telekom will receive 19.9 billion forint ($88
million) for its fully-owned Pro-M Zrt unit, the company said in
a statement to the Budapest Stock Exchange today.  “The transaction may improve the short-term cash position,
though it’s questionable how it will affect the company’s
competitive position from a strategic point of view,” Zoltan Reczey, an analyst at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in an e-
mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
