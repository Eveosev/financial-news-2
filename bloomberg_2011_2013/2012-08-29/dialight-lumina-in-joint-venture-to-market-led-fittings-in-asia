(Corrects currency of mine order in third paragraph.)  Dialight Plc (DIA) , a maker of light-
emitting diode fittings used in the London Olympics, will set up
a joint venture with  Singapore ’s Lumina Holding Systems to sell
its products in  Southeast Asia .  Dialight Asia Pte Ltd. will focus on oil and gas markets in
the region and be supplied by Dialight’s new factory in Penang,
Malaysia, the U.K. company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The company also got a $1 million order to supply two
thousand fittings to an Indonesian copper and gold mine run by a
global miner, it said, without naming the client.  The Suffolk, England-based company in July increased its
interim dividend to 4 pence from 3.3 and said annual earnings
will be “at the higher end of current market expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
