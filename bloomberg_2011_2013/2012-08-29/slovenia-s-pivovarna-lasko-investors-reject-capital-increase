 Shareholders of  Pivovarna Lasko (PILR) 
Group d.d., including the single largest owner, Nova Ljubljanska
Banka d.d., rejected a proposal for a capital increase of as
much as 36.5 million euros ($46 million).  The Slovenian drinkmaker wanted to sell 8.7 million new
shares at 8 euros apiece as it sought to strengthen its capital
base, the Lasko-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Pivovarna Lasko, which in April agreed to delay about 160
million euros in loan payments to banks in Slovenia, is the
largest shareholder of  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d., the
biggest store chain in the Balkans. The sale fell through
several times after officials in the country said it would harm
the local  food industry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
