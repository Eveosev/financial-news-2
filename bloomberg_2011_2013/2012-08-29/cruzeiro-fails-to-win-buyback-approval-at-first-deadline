Banco Cruzeiro do Sul SA, the
Brazilian bank seized by regulators, failed to win the required
90 percent investor approval by today’s first deadline for a
$1.6 billion bond-buyback plan, a person with direct knowledge
of the matter said.  The bank is confident it will gain the approval needed by
Sept. 12, the final day that investors can tender their bonds,
the person said, asking not to be identified because the
announcement isn’t yet public. Investors who tendered through
today will be paid a premium of 5 percentage points if the
buyback happens, and the bank must now seek approval from more
bondholders without the incentive of a premium.  Brazil ’s deposit-insurance fund, known as the FGC, has
overseen the Sao Paulo-based payroll lender since the central
bank uncovered accounting violations in June. It offered on Aug.
15 to buy back the bonds at discounted prices as part of a
recapitalization plan. At least 90 percent of bondholders must
accept the offer for it to proceed. Cruzeiro will be liquidated
if the offer fails, Antonio Carlos Bueno, head of the FGC, said
at an Aug. 14 press conference.  The average discount that Cruzeiro’s local and
international creditors are being asked to accept is 49 percent,
according to the FGC.  Bank of America Corp.  and HSBC Holdings
Plc are arranging the bond-repurchase offer. Cruzeiro declined
to comment, according to an official who asked not to be named.  To contact the reporter on this story:
