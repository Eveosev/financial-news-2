The  Economic Observer , a weekly
newspaper in Beijing, was fined and issued a warning over an
inaccurate report published this June that said the  Railway
Ministry  may be reformed, the Xinhua News Agency reported.  The false report resulted in “negative social impacts,”
Xinhua reported, citing a statement issued by the General
Administration of Press and Publication. It said authorities
revoked the press pass of the reporter who wrote the story.  The newspaper published an apology after the report
appeared saying the story was “not in line with facts,” and
was based on “the views of experts and online bulletin board
information.” It said the reporter who wrote the story never
contacted the ministry for comment.  The article said the ministry may lose control of
investment, construction and railway operations. It said the
ministry would establish and inject assets into three new
companies, which would be overseen by the State-Owned Assets
Supervision and Administration Commission.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
