Solar 21 Renewable Energy Ireland
Ltd., a Dublin-based fund, bought six Italian solar parks from
AEG Power Solutions BV for 25 million euros ($31 million).  The grid-connected farms in southern  Italy  will help Solar
21 deliver its pension and regular investors annual returns of
8.5 percent, according to a company statement.  Pension funds are seeking alternative assets after a
decline in  interest rates  reduced yields on bonds amid equity-
market volatility. Solar and wind projects, promoted by European
nations and supported by subsidies, operate under long-term
contracts offering steady returns.  “When you contrast this stable investment environment with
the current equity market volatility which has proven to be all
risk and little return over the past 10 years, it’s not
difficult to see why so many people are drawn to the renewable
energy investment concept,”  Michael Bradley , Solar 21’s chief
executive officer, said in the statement.  Solar 21 is also in negotiations to buy another 12
megawatts worth at least 45 million euros, according to the
company. It has raised more than 100 million euros for European
photovoltaic farms from Irish investors.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
