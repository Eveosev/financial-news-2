Treasury 10-year yields rose from
almost the lowest level in three weeks as the U.S. prepared to
sell $35 billion in five-year notes and optimism increased that
European leaders are tackling their debt crisis.  U.S. government securities fell for the first time in
three days after German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said the euro
area has the right tools to stabilize the 17-nation currency.
Treasuries gained for the past two days amid speculation Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will signal in a speech Aug. 31
a third round of bond purchases under quantitative easing.  “Merkel’s comments were favorable for risk assets, and we
have a lot of supply today and tomorrow, which is taking some of
the steam out of the Treasury market,” said  Brian Edmonds , head
of interest rates in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of 21
primary dealers obligated to bid in U.S. debt auctions.  The 10-year  yield  increased three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.67 percent at 11:52 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It fell earlier to
1.62 percent, after touching 1.61 percent yesterday, the lowest
level since Aug. 8. The price of the 1.625 percent security
maturing in August 2022 dropped 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 19/32.  Thirty-year yields rose four basis points to 2.78 percent.  Treasuries are almost the most expensive in three weeks,
according to the term premium, a model created by economists at
the Fed that includes expectations for  interest rates , growth
and inflation. The gauge was at negative 0.86 percent today
after reaching negative 0.88 percent yesterday, the costliest
level since Aug. 6.  A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value. The average
over the past decade is positive 0.46 percent.  Note Auction  The five-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 0.71
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with a record 0.584
percent at the last sale of the debt on July 25. That offering
had a  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total
bids with the amount of securities offered, of 2.71 times the
amount of debt offered, up from 2.61 at the sale in June.  “We’re not looking for an outstanding auction,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading in  New
York  at CIBC World Markets Corp. “With the uncertainty
surrounding what Bernanke will or will not say, there will have
to be a concession in the market from these levels.”  The U.S. is selling $99 billion of notes this week. The
Treasury will auction $29 billion of seven-year securities
tomorrow. It sold $35 billion of two-year notes yesterday at a
 yield  of 0.273 percent and a higher than average bid-to-cover
ratio of 3.94, versus an average of 3.75 at the past 10 sales.  Fed Speculation  Treasuries rose this week on bets the Fed, which next meets
Sept. 12-13, is planning to announce new bond purchases to
stimulate economic growth. It bought $2.3 trillion of assets in
two rounds of quantitative easing from 2008 to 2011. Bernanke is
scheduled to speak this week at the Kansas City Fed’s annual
economics conference in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming .  Minutes of the Fed’s July 31-Aug. 1 meeting released last
week showed many policy makers said additional stimulus probably
will be needed soon unless the economy shows signs of a
sustainable pickup.  The central bank will issue its Beige Book regional survey
of economic conditions today.  The Fed is also swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its
holdings with those due in six to 30 years to put downward
pressure on long-term interest rates. It’s bought $4.75 billion
of Treasuries today due from August 2018 to August 2020. The
purchase is part of an effort called Operation Twist, after a
similar program in the 1960s.  Merkel Comments  Treasuries declined as demand for refuge eased after Merkel
said she’s convinced that reforms by Italy  will help reduce the
interest rates the nation pays for its bonds. She spoke in a
joint press conference in Berlin with Italian Prime Minister
 Mario Monti .  Italian 10-year yields fell to 5.77 percent today, after
touching 6.7 percent on July 25.  Efforts to stamp out the euro bloc’s debt crisis, now in
its third year, have intensified as  Europe ’s political summer
break recedes.  U.S. government bonds extended losses after data from the
National Association of Realtors showed  pending home sales  in
the U.S. climbed 2.4 percent in July, more than double the
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, after falling 1.4 percent
in June.  The American economy expanded at a 1.7 percent annualized
pace in the second quarter, Commerce Department data showed
today, more than the government’s initial 1.5 percent estimate a
month ago. Gross domestic product grew 2 percent in the first
quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
