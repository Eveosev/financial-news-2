Agrokor d.d.,  Croatia ’s largest
company, hired former central bank Governor Zeljko Rohatinski as
adviser to the company’s owner Ivica Todoric, spokeswoman
Manuela Celic said today.  Rohatinski, who left the  central bank  post in July after
two six-year terms, is credited with keeping the kuna steady
against the euro.  Agrokor, the largest food producer and retailer by revenue
in the Balkans, has attempted in the past two years to acquire
Slovenia’s  Mercator Poslovni Sistem d.d.  The Zagreb-based
company withdrew its bid in February, saying the protracted
process was harmful to both companies.  While Agrokor is not publicly traded, some of the companies
it holds are listed on the  Zagreb Stock Exchange , such as its
retail arm  Konzum d.d.   To contact the reporter on this story:
