Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) , the largest seller of
mobile-phone semiconductors, is hiring Chris Borroni-Bird, who
left  General Motors Co. (GM)  where he developed futuristic vehicles,
said a person familiar with the decision.  The person asked not to be identified because the hiring
hasn’t been announced.  Borroni-Bird, who joined Detroit-based GM about a decade
ago after working at the predecessor of Chrysler Group LLC,
worked on advanced vehicle research and development. He wrote a
book, “Reinventing the Automobile,” with then-GM Vice
President of R&D Lawrence Burns and William Mitchell, the late
Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, about the
future of urban mobility that was published in 2010.  GM yesterday said Borroni-Bird left his job at the
automaker to work for another company.  Emily Kilpatrick , a
spokeswoman for San Diego-based Qualcomm, declined to comment,
and GM didn’t make Borroni-Bird available.  Borroni-Bird, seen in recent years demonstrating projects
such as the pod-like EN-V self-driving vehicle, was becoming a
public face for GM’s advanced technology efforts,  Jim Hall , a
principal of consulting firm 2953 Analytics Inc., said yesterday
in a telephone interview.  “Every loss of an employee at General Motors is at one
point a problem for them right now,” said Hall, who is based in
Birmingham, Michigan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
