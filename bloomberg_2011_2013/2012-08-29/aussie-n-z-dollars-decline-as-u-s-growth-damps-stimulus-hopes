The Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell versus their U.S. peer after American economic data
showed signs of growth, damping speculation of further stimulus.  The two South Pacific nations’ currencies weakened after
the  Federal Reserve  said yesterday the  U.S. economy  continued to
expand “gradually.” The New Zealand dollar fell versus the yen
as U.S. reports also showed gross domestic product grew more
than previously estimated in the second quarter and pending home
sales in July exceeded forecasts.  “The pick-up in activity is modest and there is no new
leading factor that forces us to change our view that further
stimulus is awaiting approval,”  Andrew Wilkinson , chief
economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, wrote
yesterday in a note to clients.  The Aussie fell 0.2 percent to $1.0352 in New York
yesterday, after earlier gaining as much as 0.2 percent. The
currency was little changed at 81.47 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, known as the kiwi, decreased 0.5
percent to 80.05 U.S. cents, after also rising as much as 0.2
percent earlier. The kiwi fell 0.3 percent to 63.01 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
decreased was little changed. The  S&P 500 Index  gained 0.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
