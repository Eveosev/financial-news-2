Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  is close to an
agreement with  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  to buy  Geniki Bank (TGEN)  SA, the
French lender’s Greek unit,  Euro2day  reported, without citing
anyone.  Societe Generale  will cover the 350 million euros ($440
million) needed for Geniki’s recapitalization and the Hellenic
Financial Stability Fund has already approved the transaction,
the Greek financial website reported today.  An announcement is likely in the coming days, Euro2day
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
