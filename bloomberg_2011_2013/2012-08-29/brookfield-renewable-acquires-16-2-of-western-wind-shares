  Western Wind Energy Corp. (WND) , a
Canadian energy developer, surged to its highest level in four
years after Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners LP acquired
16.2 percent of its common shares, becoming its second-largest
shareholder.  Western Wind  rose 10 percent to C$2.30 at the close in
Toronto, the highest since August 2008.  Brookfield, a developer and operator of wind and
hydroelectric projects in Canada, the U.S. and Brazil, bought
10.7 million shares in Western Wind for C2.25 ($2.28) each,
according to a statement today. It also acquired 319,700
warrants, representing 0.5 percent of Western Western Wind’s
shares, if exercised, for C$1 each.  Owning a portion of Western Wind gives Brookfield a share
of its tax credits that the developer may apply to its U.S.
bill, according to  James Morrison , an analyst with Cormark
Securities Inc. in Toronto.  “Brookfield has significant U.S. taxable income,” he said
in an interview today. “They’re a good fit.”  Western Wind has risen 93 percent since it said July 30
that it was for sale. Its board said at the time it expected a
sale price between the C$2.50 offered in a takeover bid last
year and the more than C$5 value consultants gave to the
company. Goodman & Co. Investment Counsel Ltd owns 17.5 percent
of its shares, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  It owns and operates three wind projects in California with
a total of 154.5 megawatts of capacity and a 10.5-megawatt
combined wind-and-solar plant in Arizona and is developing a
project in  Puerto Rico .  To contact the reporter on this story:
