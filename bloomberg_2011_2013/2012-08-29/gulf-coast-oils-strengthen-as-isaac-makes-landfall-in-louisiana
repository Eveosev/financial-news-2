U.S. Gulf Coast oils strengthened as
Hurricane Isaac made landfall near  New Orleans  and as the gap
widened between West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil.  Isaac, now a tropical storm, was 50 miles (80 kilometers)
west-southwest of New Orleans at 2 p.m. local time, according to
the National Hurricane Center. The storm wasn’t expected to
cause significant damage to area refineries, which are built to
withstand stronger storms.  WTI’s discount versus Brent gained 80 cents to $17.05 a
barrel based on October settlement prices. When Brent increases
at a faster pace than WTI, it usually strengthens the value of
the U.S. grades that compete with foreign oils priced against
the European benchmark.  The premium for Heavy Louisiana Sweet versus West Texas
Intermediate added $1.70 to $16.70 a barrel at 2:03 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . Light Louisiana Sweet gained $1.50
to $16 over WTI.  The  difference  between Poseidon and the U.S. benchmark
widened by $1.60 to $12.10 a barrel, while Mars Blend added $1
to $12. Southern Green Canyon’s premium rose by 75 cents to $11
a barrel.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, advanced $1.75 to
trade at a premium of $17.  Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $2.50 above WTI. The
discount for Bakken oil from  North Dakota  was steady at 50 cents
while Western Canada Select’s dropped by $1.25 to a $16.50.  West Texas Sour’s difference widened 20 cents to trade
$3.80 below WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
