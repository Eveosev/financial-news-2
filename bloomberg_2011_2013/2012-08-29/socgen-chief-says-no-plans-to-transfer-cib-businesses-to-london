Societe Generale SA (GLE)  has no plans to
shift corporate- and investment-banking businesses to London and
is about to open a new facility in Paris to enlarge its trading
headquarters, Chief Executive Officer  Frederic Oudea  said.  “There is absolutely no plan to move our businesses to
London,” Oudea said in a Bloomberg Television interview near
Versailles, France, today. “We have selected Paris as the core
center for our corporate- and investment-banking and we are just
close to effectively inaugurate a new building, and as part of
that we are just reviewing, as normal, our implementation.”  Some of Societe Generale’s Paris-based traders are being
offered salary increases of between 20 percent and 30 percent to
transfer to London, French daily Les Echos reported yesterday,
without saying where it got the information. Traders are also
being offered guarantees that they will not be fired during two
years if they agree to move,  Les Echos  said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
