Georgian troops killed as many as 11
militants and freed several civilian hostages after clashing
with gunmen near the border with  Russia ’s Dagestan region, the
 Interior Ministry  said.  Three Georgian soldiers were also killed during the
operation, with the gunfight still continuing, Nodar
Kharshiladze, a deputy interior minister, said today by phone
from the capital, Tbilisi. As many as six militants are
surrounded by Georgian troops, he said.  Georgia started the operation to free civilian hostages
after discovering a large group of suspected militants near the
village of Lapankuri in the Kakhetia region, according to
Kharshiladze.  Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili compared the
incident to terrorist activities and kidnappings in the north
Caucasus region in the 1990s, when Russian troops fought with
the breakaway republic of Chechnya.  “We have peace and quiet over here,” Saakashvili said in
televised remarks. “We will not allow this to happen again, to
spread on our territory and threaten our people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
