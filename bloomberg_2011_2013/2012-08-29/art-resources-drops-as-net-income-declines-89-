Mart Resources Inc. (MMT) , the Calgary-
based oil explorer with Nigerian production, fell the most in
almost seven months after second-quarter profit declined on
pipeline disruptions and lower output.  The shares  dropped  12 percent to C$1.48 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest decline since Jan. 31.  Second-quarter net income fell 89 percent to C$2.3 million
($2.33 million) from C$20.8 million a year earlier, the company
said today in a statement. The company’s share of production
from the Umusadege project in  Nigeria  fell 23 percent to 4,491
barrels a day. The field was shut for nine days during the
quarter because of pipeline disruptions, well testing and
maintenance.  About 18 percent of the oil sent along the pipeline serving
the field in Nigeria’s Delta state was lost, Mart said, calling
the rate “anomalous.” Mart and its partners in the project are
in talks with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  about building an
alternative export pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
