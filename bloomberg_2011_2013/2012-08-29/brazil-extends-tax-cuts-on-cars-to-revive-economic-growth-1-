Brazil ’s government extended for two
months a tax cut on vehicles that has helped revive sales and
spur growth in the world’s second-biggest emerging market.  Tax cuts on new car purchases that were scheduled to expire
this month will be remain in place until the end of October,
while ones on washing machines, stoves and other home appliances
will now last until the end of the year, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told reporters in Brasilia today.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government reduced the so-called
IPI tax for automobiles in May, helping to spur  vehicle sales 
from a second-quarter low of 257,887 in April to 364,196 in
July, according to figures from the national carmakers
association known as Anfavea.  The cuts boosted furniture and appliance sales 15.8 percent
in June from last year, and were the second-highest contributor
to a 12.3 percent increase in the  broad retail sales  index, the
national statistics agency said earlier this month. Sales of
cars, motorcycles and auto parts jumped 19.8 percent in June
from last year.  The central bank’s  economic activity  index rose 0.75
percent in June, the fastest pace in 15 months, adding to
evidence that the 500 basis points in interest rate cuts over
the past year and other efforts to boost growth are starting to
take hold.  Brazil’s  gross domestic product  likely expanded 0.5 percent
in the second quarter, after growing 0.2 percent in the January-
March period, according to the median estimate of 50 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of an Aug. 31 report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
