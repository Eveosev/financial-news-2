Canadian natural gas rose as
forecasts for hotter-than-normal weather next week in most of
the U.S. signaled more demand for the power-plant fuel.  September gas in Alberta  gained 4.2 percent as MDA EarthSat
Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted above-normal
temperatures in most of the lower 48 states from  Sept. 5 to
Sept. 7. About 3 billion cubic feet, or 67 percent, of Gulf of
Mexico gas production is shut because of Hurricane Isaac, a
Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement report  yesterday 
showed.  “I have seen some temperatures slightly above normal for
the next couple of weeks,” said Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke
Associates LLC in Louisville, Kentucky. “It could be a bounce
off the weakness we have seen over the past few days.”  Alberta gas for September delivery rose 6.75 cents to
C$1.995 per gigajoule ($1.92 per million British thermal units)
as of 2:20 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for September delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  rose 1.6 cents, or 0.6 percent, or $2.63 per
million Btu at 1:21 p.m. The futures are down 12 percent this
year.  The high temperature in Houston on Sept. 5 will be 93
degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius), 2 above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Detroit  may be
83 degrees and New York may be 85 degrees, 6 above normal for
both cities.  Cooling Demand  U.S. cooling demand may be 29 percent above normal in the
week ending Sept. 5, according to Weather Derivatives in Belton,
 Missouri . Power generators account for 36 percent of U.S. gas
consumption, Energy Department data show.  The  National Hurricane Center  said Isaac, with top winds of
75 miles (120 kilometers) per hour, was 10 miles northwest of
Houma,  Louisiana , at noon East Coast time. The Gulf accounted
for about 7 percent of U.S. gas production in 2011, compared
with 17 percent in 2005, Energy Department data show.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.1 billion cubic
feet at 1 p.m. New York time, below the target of 16.2 billion.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.19 billion cubic feet
at Empress,  Alberta , where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.09 billion cubic feet.  There was no available capacity on TransCanada’s British
Columbia system at Kingsgate. The system was forecast to carry
2.07 billion cubic feet today, above the estimated capacity of
2.02 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.01
billion cubic feet at 12:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
