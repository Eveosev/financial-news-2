Ethanol rose for the first time in
more than a week as corn prices advanced with dry conditions
expected in the Midwest.  Ethanol gained 1 percent. The Midwest will be dry today and
tomorrow, with only a few sprinkles in the north of the region,
forecaster Telvent DTN said today in a report. Hurricane Isaac
will bring a chance for rain in parts of Oklahoma and  Kansas  by
Friday as most of the western Midwest stays dry, according to
the brief.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 2.6 cents to
settle at $2.606 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. It was
the first gain since Aug. 21. Prices have climbed 18 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol sank 1 cent in  New York  to
$2.64 a gallon, rose 1 cent in Chicago at $2.57, slipped 1 cent
in the U.S. Gulf to $2.61 and lost 1 cent on the West Coast at
$2.72, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 11:04 a.m. New
York time.  Corn for December delivery rose 18 cents to $8.135 a bushel
in  Chicago . One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Producers are losing 34 cents on each gallon of the
renewable fuel they make, based on the September contracts for
corn and the biofuel, Bloomberg data show.  Plants can ease those losses by selling dried distillers
grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to
cattle and livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
