Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA 
rose the most in almost four weeks after reporting a record
quarterly profit as demand for agricultural fertilizers grew.  Soquimich, as the company is also known, rose 2.5 percent
to 29,405 pesos at the close in Santiago, the most since Aug. 3.  The fertilizer producer reported last night second-quarter
profit of $192 million, up 45 percent from $132 million a year
earlier and above the average estimate of $158 million in a
Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  “SQM remains our top pick in the agricultural sector given
solid pricing and capacity expansions,” Banchile-Citi analysts
Juan Tavarez and Felipe Jiman wrote in an e-mailed research note
to clients.  Revenue rose 24 percent from a year earlier to $683
million. The increase was due to higher prices in most product
segments, according to Banchile-Citi, the joint research
department of Banco de Chile and Citigroup Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
