Andrew Strauss  is set to resign as
England’s Test cricket captain today after 3 1/2 years in the
job, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Hugh Morris, the managing director of the England team, is
scheduled to hold a press conference at Lord’s in London today
with England and Wales Cricket Board Chairman Giles Clarke also
scheduled to address the media later, when he’s expected to pay
tribute to Strauss, the newspaper said.  It’s unclear if Strauss, 35, will play on as an opening
batsman and continue a career in which he’s scored 21 centuries
in 100 Tests for England, the Telegraph said. He was non-
committal about his future at the end of the Test series defeat
against South Africa, when England lost its No. 1 Test ranking,
the newspaper added.  Strauss’s fellow opener  Alastair Cook , England’s one-day
skipper, is the next in line for the Test captaincy, the
Telegraph added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
