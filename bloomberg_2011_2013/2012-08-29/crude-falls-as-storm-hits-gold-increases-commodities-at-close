The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities dropped 0.3 percent to 666.20 at 7:23 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
fell 0.2 percent to 1,586.5422.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell from the highest closing price in a week in  New
York  after Hurricane Isaac made landfall in the U.S. and
industrialized nations expressed concern that elevated prices
may threaten the global economic recovery.  Oil for October delivery declined as much as 66 cents to
$95.67 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $95.72 at 3:04 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday climbed 0.9 percent to $96.33, the highest
close since Aug. 22. Prices are 3.2 percent lower this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas prices fell for a fifth day as Hurricane Isaac
made landfall, potentially curbing demand and bringing colder
weather.  Gas fell as much as 0.7 percent after Hurricane Isaac came
ashore in southeastern  Louisiana  at 6:45 p.m. local time
yesterday. The storm may decrease industrial consumption for
natural gas by 1.5 billion cubic feet a day, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said in a report e-mailed today.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a benchmark oil in  Asia ,
fell 42 cents, or 2 percent, to $20.61 a barrel at 10:07 a.m.
Singapore time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.,
a broker. This measure of the profit from making the fuel rose
yesterday to $21.03 a barrel, the most since June 16, 2011.
Gasoil swaps for September fell 75 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $130.05 a barrel, PVM data showed.  Naphtha  swaps for September fell $7.25, or 0.8 percent, to
$952 a metric ton, according to PVM. Japan naphtha’s premium to
London-traded Brent crude futures dropped $4.39, or 4 percent,
to $106.69 a ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BASE METALS  Copper declined for a third day as concern that Chinese
demand is slowing outweighed expectations data are set to show
an improving U.S. economy. Tin dropped the most in a month after
an Indonesian producer restarted sales.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold is poised to advance for a second day on speculation
that Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may hint at fresh
stimulus measures in a speech later this week and as investor
holdings climbed to an all-time high.  Gold for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.2 percent to
$1,669.95 an ounce, erasing an earlier 0.2 percent decline. The
metal was little changed at $1,668.50 at 2:53 p.m. in Singapore.
Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by bullion rose to a
record, overtaking  Italy  to become the world’s third-biggest
hoard. December-delivery futures were little changed at
$1,671.30 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  Spot silver gained as much as 0.3 percent to $30.9669 an
ounce, erasing an earlier 0.5 percent drop. Palladium dropped as
much as 0.7 percent to $634.75 an ounce and was at $637.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans climbed for a second day on speculation rain from
Hurricane Isaac will fail to improve crop conditions in the U.S.
after the worst drought in at least half a century wilted crops.  Soybeans for November delivery gained as much as 0.4
percent to $17.2925 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and
were at $17.285 at 3:16 p.m. in  Singapore . Prices reached a
record $17.605 on Aug. 27 are up 5.4 percent this month.  Corn for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to $7.9425 a
bushel. Wheat for December gained as much as 0.4 percent to
$8.79 a bushel and was at $8.7775. Prices fell 0.7 percent
yesterday, the fifth straight decline and the longest slide
since September.  Rubber declined for a second day as crude oil, used to make
the synthetic variety, fell from a one-week high as Hurricane
Isaac passed over the  Gulf of Mexico  to make landfall.  February-delivery rubber dropped to as low as 217.5 yen a
kilogram ($2,767 a metric ton) before settling at 219.5 yen on
the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures have lost 4.5 percent this
month, heading for a sixth month of decline.  Palm oil  fell to the lowest level in more than a week on
speculation that stockpiles in  Malaysia , the largest producer
after  Indonesia , may increase this month as supplies outpace
exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
