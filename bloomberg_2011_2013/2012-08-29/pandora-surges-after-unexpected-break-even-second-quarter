Pandora Media Inc. (P) , the Internet
radio service, surged the most in 14 months after reporting
break-even second-quarter results, excluding some items, that
beat analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  rose 20 percent to $12.07 at 2:38 p.m. in  New
York , after jumping as much as 23 percent for the biggest
intraday gain since June 15, 2011. Analysts had expected a loss
of 3 cents, the average of 19 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Mobile advertising grew 86 percent in the period ended
July 31, the company said. Marketers have been persuaded that
ads for devices such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and Android-based
smart phones are effective, said  Joe Kennedy , Pandora’s chairman
and chief executive officer.  “Our mobile monetization strategies are working,” Kennedy
said in an interview. “That is the core of our performance.”  Sales climbed 51 percent to $101.3 million in the quarter,
Oakland, California-based Pandora said in a statement. Analysts
had projected $101.1 million.  Pandora also said third-quarter and full-year results will
exceed analysts’  estimates . The company expects $115 million to
$118 million in revenue this quarter, versus the $115.4 million
projected by analysts. The company also forecasts break even to
profit of 1 cent a share, excluding items, in line with
analysts’ projections.  For the year, Pandora estimates sales of $425 million to
$432 million, more than the $423.9 million analysts expected,
and projects a loss of 4 cents to 8 cents a share, excluding
items. Analysts estimated a loss of 11 cents on that basis.  “Subscriber revenue and mobile revenue per minute
improvements were bright spots and a guidance raise drew
optimism from investors,”  Scott Devitt , an analyst with Morgan
Stanley in New York, wrote today in a report.  Advertising sales climbed 53 percent in the second quarter
to $89.4 million, while content costs from streaming music
increased 79 percent to $60.5 million, the company said.  Chief Financial Officer Steve Cakebread will leave the
company at the end of the year to pursue other opportunities, he
said on a conference call after the results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
