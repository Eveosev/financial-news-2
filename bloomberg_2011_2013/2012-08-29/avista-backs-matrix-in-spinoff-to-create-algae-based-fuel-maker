Avista Corp. (AVA) , a U.S. energy holding
company, provided backing to help Matrix Genetics LLC complete
its spinoff from the biotechnology company  Targeted Growth Inc.   Targeted Growth, which also created the biofuel companies
AltAir Fuels LLC and Sustainable Oils Inc., is refocusing on its
core agricultural business, and “the spinout of Matrix is part
of that strategy,” Matrix spokesman  John Williams  said today by
e-mail.  Matrix, based in Seattle, is developing renewable fuels and
chemicals from blue-green algae, and Avista’s funding will also
support research into new strains that will be easier to
cultivate and boost output, according to a statement today that
didn’t say how much Avista invested.  Blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, are “the most
abundant, diverse and robust micro-algae on Earth,” according
to the statement. Matrix is modifying its genes to create
proprietary strains that yield larger quantities of oil or have
other optimal traits for fuels or chemical production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
