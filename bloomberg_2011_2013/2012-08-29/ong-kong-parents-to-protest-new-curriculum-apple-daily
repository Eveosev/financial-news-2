More than 10,000  Hong Kong  parents
and activists plan to protest against perceived Communist
propaganda in a government education program, the Apple Daily
newspaper reported.  The  Parents’ Concern Group on National Education  plans to
stage a demonstration in the city’s legislative building and
later the government’s new administrative headquarters on Sept.
1, the first day of the new school semester, spokeswoman Linda
Wong told the Apple Daily newspaper.  The group will ask the government to abort the planned
national education program, the newspaper said.  Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who was inaugurated as
Hong Kong’s top leader on July 1, said in a July 30 statement
that the government won’t force the introduction of the lessons
in September. His approval rating has dropped to 36 percent, the
lowest during his less than two months on the job, according to
a poll conducted by the University of Hong Kong between Aug. 14
and 18,  Apple Daily  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
