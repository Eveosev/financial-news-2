Morgan Stanley bought a cargo of  jet
fuel  for a second day. Vitol Group sold a shipment of diesel for
delivery to  France .  Trafigura Beheer BV purchased gasoline on the barge and
cargo market. Gasoil rose for the first time in four sessions on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London.  Light Products  Morgan Stanley sold the 25,000 metric-ton cargo of gasoline
at $1,098 a ton for loading at Santa Panagia Bay in  Italy ,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window. That compares with trades for shipment to
the U.K. at $1,089 and $1,090 on Aug. 10.  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $1,090 to $1,096 a ton, according
to a similar survey of the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares
with yesterday’s deals from $1,093 to $1,102.  Trafigura bought the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is
added to make finished fuel, for at least a seventh day. Gunvor
Group Ltd. and  BP Plc (BP/)  sold barge lots which are usually 1,000
tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  crack , or premium to Brent, fell for the first
time in five sessions to $16.31 a barrel as of 1:28 p.m. local
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker
in London. That compares with $16.56 in the previous session.  Naphtha’s  discount  to  Brent crude  was little changed at
$5.09 a barrel, PVM data show. The discount has narrowed $3.59 a
barrel, or 41 percent, since the start of the month.  Naphtha has gained because of “improved petrochemical
margins and re-emerging Asian demand,”  David Wech , analyst at
Vienna-based JBC Energy GmbH, said today in an e-mailed report.  Middle Distillates  Vitol sold two 30,000 ton lots of jet fuel for delivery to
northwest Europe, the Platts survey showed. BP bought one cargo
for delivery to the Isle of Grain in the U.K. partially priced
at a $4 premium to benchmark prices and at $91 more than
September gasoil.  Morgan Stanley purchased the other consignment for delivery
to Antwerp in  Belgium  at parity to benchmark prices and at a $93
premium to front-month gasoil. That compares with a similar
trade yesterday at $96 more than September gasoil.  On the barge market, BP sold a lot of the  aviation fuel  to
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  at a $1.50 discount to benchmark prices.  Total SA bought the diesel cargo for delivery to  Le Havre 
in northern France partially priced at parity to benchmark
prices and at $31.50 more than September gasoil, the survey
showed. That compares with Aug. 16 deals into northwest Europe
at premiums of $37, $40 and $42.  On the diesel barge market, Morgan Stanley was the buyer
for at least a seventh day, according to Platts. North Sea Group
sold 2,300 tons at $33 more than September gasoil. That’s down
from yesterday’s deal at $34 and $36.  Gasoil for September delivery gained $1 to $980 a ton on
the ICE exchange in London as of 5:19 p.m. local time. The
October contract was at $979.25 a ton.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability,
dropped to $19.09 a barrel as of 4:30 p.m. from $19.20
yesterday. Brent was little changed at $112.53 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded at $640.50 to $642.25 a ton,
according to the survey of Platts. That compares with $641 to
$642.50 in the previous session. The low-sulfur grade changed
hands at $701 and $701.50 up from $693.50 a ton yesterday, the
survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
