A majority of registered voters in
the U.S. viewed  Mitt Romney  unfavorably as Republicans gathered
in Tampa,  Florida , to select him as the party’s presidential
nominee, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll.  Romney is the first party standard-bearer to have a higher
unfavorable rating than favorable at the start of his party’s
convention since  Walter Mondale  became the Democratic nominee 28
years ago, according to the poll.  The poll showed 51 percent viewed Romney unfavorably and 40
percent viewed him favorably. In 1984, Mondale, poised to win
the Democratic presidential nomination, was regarded unfavorably
by 49 percent and favorably by 47 percent. Mondale lost to
President  Ronald Reagan  in a landslide as the Republican won re-
election.  The new survey was taken before the Republican convention
began in Tampa this week. Romney’s unfavorable rating is an
impediment to his efforts to defeat President  Barack Obama  even
as U.S. unemployment exceeds 8 percent and the nation’s economy
struggles to recover. Obama was viewed favorably by 50 percent
and unfavorably by 47 percent in the poll.  Obama has been in favorable territory since January. Even
so, his current favorable rating is lower than any winner since
at least 1984, except for  George H.W. Bush  in 1988, who had a 49
percent favorable and a 36 percent unfavorable rating.  Romney’s 51 percent unfavorable rating is his highest since
the question was asked beginning in September 2011, and higher
than any nominee of either party since 1984. He was viewed
favorably by 46 percent of men and 34 percent of women, while 47
percent of men and 55 percent of women viewed him unfavorably.  The poll of 814 registered voters was taken Aug. 22-26 and
had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
