Lithuania’s  economy  expanded at a
faster rate in the second quarter than previously estimated as
domestic demand helped relieve falling output at the country’s
biggest exporter.  Gross domestic product grew a revised 2.2 percent from the
same three months of 2011, compared with a preliminary estimate
of 2.1 percent released on July 30, the Vilnius-based  statistics
office  said in an e-mailed statement today. Output rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent from the previous quarter. The
economy expanded 3.9 percent in the first three months from a
year earlier.  Growth is slowing from the second-fastest pace in the
European Union behind  Latvia  in the first quarter as export
growth decelerates amid a debt crisis in  Europe . After growing
5.9 percent in the 2011, GDP will expand 3 percent this year,
the central bank predicts.  Orlen Lietuva AB stopped production for a month in May to
carry out maintenance and the biggest upgrade in the oil
refiner’s history, reducing output capacity by 26 percent in the
second quarter from the first, the company said.  Retail sales  grew 4 percent in the second quarter from a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
