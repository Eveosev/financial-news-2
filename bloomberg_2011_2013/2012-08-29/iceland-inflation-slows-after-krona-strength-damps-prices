Iceland’s annual inflation slowed
this month as the strengthening krona helped damp price gains in
the north Atlantic island.  The inflation rate fell to 4.1 percent in August from 4.6
percent the prior month, Reykjavik-based  Statistics Iceland  said
today on its website. Consumer prices fell 0.2 percent in the
month, the agency said.  The central bank this month kept its benchmark rate
unchanged at 5.75 percent, after raising rates five times in the
last 12 months. The bank, which targets 2.5 percent inflation,
sees price growth averaging at 5.4 percent this year, 3.4
percent next year and 3 percent in 2014.  “The inflation outlook for the next two years has improved
since the Monetary Policy Committee’s last meeting, although
inflation is not expected to reach the bank’s inflation target
until the end of the period,”  Sedlabanki  said on Aug. 22.  The currency climbed to more than a three-year high earlier
this month, before paring gains following the central bank
decision to shelve tightening plans. The krona has fallen about
2.4 percent since the Aug. 22 rate decision.  “In the short term, matters have certainly improved but
the flip side is that the winter could turn out to be more
challenging as the current krona exchange rate can’t be
maintained, unless the central bank and the government can
through craftiness prevent the krona from weakening.”     Asdis
Kristjansdottir, head of research at  Arion Banki hf , said in a
note to clients prior to the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
