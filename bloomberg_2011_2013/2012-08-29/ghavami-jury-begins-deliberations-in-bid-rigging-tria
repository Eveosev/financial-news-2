A Manhattan federal jury began
weighing charges against former  UBS AG (UBSN)  managing director Peter Ghavami and two of his ex-colleagues, who are accused of rigging
bids for municipal finance deals.  Ghavami and former UBS employees Gary Heinz and Michael
Welty face charges that they manipulated the competitive bidding
process for investing the proceeds of municipal bonds.
Prosecutors accused the men of cheating states, cities and other
issuers by rigging their bids.  The trial follows a five-year federal investigation into
the $3.7 trillion municipal  bond market . As many as 13 people
have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the probe and as
many as 15 have been convicted.  The case is U.S. v. Ghavami, 10-cr-1217, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
