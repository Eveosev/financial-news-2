Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU)  gained the
most in a week in  New York  after stating that the search engine
it started this month uses the company’s own technology.  Beijing-based Qihoo, which develops computer security
software, rose the most since Aug. 22, adding 2 percent to
$21.99 at the close of trading in New York.  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , owner of
China’s largest online search engine, tumbled 6.2 percent to
$113.10 a day after gaining the most in three weeks.  Qihoo  said  on its website that its search engine, begun on
Aug. 16, was developed over seven years and is based on
technology for which it holds intellectual property rights.
Baidu has been redirecting all queries made through its search
engine, including those that originated from other platforms
such as Qihoo’s, to its home page, according to Henry Guo, an
analyst at ThinkEquity LLC.  “Qihoo is still far below Baidu but it’s showing very good
momentum already,” Guo, who has a buy rating on Qihoo and
Baidu, said in a phone interview from  San Francisco . “So far,
so good for Qihoo.”  Baidu controls about 80 percent of China’s Internet search
market compared to Qihoo, which handled about 10 percent of
traffic as of Aug. 26, Guo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
