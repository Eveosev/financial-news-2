Tropical Hurricane Isaac is
beginning to move inland into southeast Louisiana, according to
the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  A storm surge of as much as 12 feet and a flood threat from
heavy trains will probably continue today and tonight, the NHC
said in an advisory on its website at 4:58 a.m.  New York  time.  Isaac, the ninth named Atlantic weather system of 2012, is
30 miles south-southeast of Houma, Louisiana, and 60 miles
south-southwest of New Orleans and is moving west-northwest at 8
miles per hour, the NHC said.  The hurricane has maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per
hour, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
