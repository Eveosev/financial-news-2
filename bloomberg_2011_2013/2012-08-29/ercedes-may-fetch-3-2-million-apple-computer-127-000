Classic cars by Ferrari, Mercedes
and Lagonda will be auctioned in the U.K. as the market for
collectible autos absorbs the impact of this summer’s record
$263.3 million sales in  California .  An unrestored 1928 Mercedes-Benz S-Type may fetch as much
as 2 million pounds ($3.2 million). It is the most highly
estimated car among 84 being offered by Bonhams in its annual
“Goodwood Revival” event in Sussex.  Proceeds at this month’s sales by  Russo and Steele ,
Bonhams, Mecum, RM Auctions and  Gooding & Co . were 33 percent
higher than in 2011, according to figures supplied by the
Geneva-based car dealer Kidston SA.  “Though both the headline prices and selling rates were
higher, auctioneers often had to work harder,” the company’s
founder Simon Kidston said in an interview. “Too many sellers
are getting ahead of themselves in a bullish market.”  Bonhams’s Mercedes, a German four-seat tourer that dealers
dub the Bugatti Veyron of its day, has been owned by the same
English family since it was purchased in 1928.  Kept for decades in a purpose-built garage, the car has
only 8,375 miles on its odometer. The estimate would have been
considerably higher had the 1920s coachwork been made by
Mercedes, rather than Cadogan Motors of  London , dealers said.  The Bonhams sale on Sept. 15 will also include a restored
V12 team Lagonda that came fourth in the 1939 Le Mans 24-Hour
race. Damaged by a V1 “Doodlebug” flying bomb in 1944, it is
estimated at more than 1 million pounds.  Ferrari Demand  RM and Gooding both found buyers for more than 89 percent
of their lots in California, with increased demand especially
for Ferrari road cars from the 1950s and 1960s. A 1960
“competition” 250 GT California Spyder sold for $11.3 million
at Gooding.  Prewar cars drew the most selective bidding. A 1936
Mercedes-Benz 540 K Special Roadster estimated at as much as $16
million fell to a single bid of $11.8 million with fees at
Gooding. A 1935 Duesenberg Model JN Convertible Coupe formerly
owned by the Hollywood star  Clark Gable  failed to sell against
an estimate of more than $9 million.  “There aren’t many people around who still remember these
vehicles and haven’t gone to the great car park in the sky,”
Kidston said. “The market’s more focused on the 1950s and
1960s. Everyone collects Ferraris. People find safety in
numbers.”  Original Apple  An original 1976 Apple personal computer is estimated at as
much as 80,000 pounds (or $127,000) at an auction.  The Apple-1 machine, one of about 200 designed and built by
 Steve Wozniak , is being offered from the estate of former Apple
employee Joe Copson at Christie’s International in London on
Oct. 9. Lacking the original box, it has a low estimate of
50,000 pounds.  “It’s an interesting object,” Saf Waterman, a director of
the London-based scientific instrument dealers  Trevor Philip &
Sons , said in an interview. “So far, though, they’re a very
small part of the market. There aren’t enough of them and not
many people want to put an old computer in their living room.
It’s more of a museum piece.”  Fewer than 50 of the Apple-1 model are thought to survive,
said Christie’s. Another version, complete with its original box
and a signed letter from  Steve Jobs , the company co-founder,
sold at Christie’s for 133,250 pounds in 2010.  Financier’s Ship  U.S. financier  Tom Perkins , a former director of  News Corp .
and Hewlett-Packard Co., is among the sellers at Sotheby’s
inaugural “Collections” auction in London.  The Sept. 27 sale has more than 300 lots of artworks and
antiques from five separate private collections that are
estimated to raise more than 1.7 million pounds.  Perkins, 80, is a founder of venture capital firm Kleiner
Perkins Caufield & Byers. His Elizabethan manor, Plumpton Place
in Sussex,  England , contained a meter-high (3-foot) solid-silver
model of a 16th-century sailing ship, now valued at 15,000 pounds
to 20,000 pounds.  In 2006 Perkins took delivery of the 289-foot sailing yacht
“Maltese Falcon,” then the biggest privately owned boat of its
kind. He sold it to Elena Ambrosiadou of the London-based hedge
fund Ikos Asset Management Ltd. in July 2009.  Sotheby’s (BID)  plans to capitalize on buyers’ desire for pieces
from prestigious sources. Prices for individual lots range from
500 pounds to 100,000 pounds. A second “Collections” sale is
planned for the spring of 2013, the  New York  auction house said.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
