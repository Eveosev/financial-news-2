Serbia  will pay part of what it owes
to  Fiat SpA (F)  this year for their joint venture that makes 500L
compacts and will roll the rest over to 2013 as the government
struggles to narrow its  budget deficit .  Serbia will invest 50 million euros ($62.7 million) of the
90 million euros it’s contractually obliged to invest this year
in  Fiat Automobili Srbija , the car plant 33-percent owned by the
state, after a supplementary budget is adopted next month, the
government said in an e-mailed statement today after Alfredo
Altavilla, Fiat’s head of business development, met with Finance
and Economy Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  in Belgrade.  “The Italians accepted the proposal by the finance
minister” as the new government, which took office last month,
explained that the previous Cabinet had failed to include the
obligation in the 2012 budget.  The payment delay shouldn’t affect production of the 500L,
the five-seat version of the 500 subcompact, which began in July
in Kragujevac, central Serbia, the ministry said. As many as
30,000 cars will be made this year, producing revenue of 350
million euros. Output in 2013 is scheduled to rise to 120,000
units, according to the ministry.  Serbia’s economy is in its second recession in three years.
The budget deficit widened to 7.2 percent of gross domestic
product at the end of June and public debt rose to 54.7 percent
of GDP. The Balkan nation’s fiscal rules cap the budget gap at
4.5 percent of GDP and public debt at 45 percent.  Sergio Marchionne , Fiat’s chief executive officer, will
visit Serbia next week, the ministry said.  Fiat formed the joint venture in 2008 when it took over
Serbia’s carmaker Zastava Automobili in Kragujevac, 110
kilometers (68 miles) south of Belgrade. Fiat renovated
Zastava’s facilities, while the government pledged to provide
infrastructure, including a highway to Kragujevac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
