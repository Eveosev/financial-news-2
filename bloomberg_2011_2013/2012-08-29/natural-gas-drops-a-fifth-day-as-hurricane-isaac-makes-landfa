Natural gas futures in  New York 
gained for the first time in five days, rebounding from a two-
month low, on forecasts of hotter-than-normal weather in the
Southeast that may boost demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas advanced as much as 1.2 percent. The weather may be
hotter than normal in the southern U.S. and Great Lakes region
Sept. 3 through Sept. 7, according to Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland. Hurricane Isaac was about 45 miles
(75 kilometers) southwest of  New Orleans  at 12 p.m. local time,
the National Hurricane Center said.  “We have a bit of heat scheduled for the next 10 days, but
September and October will be more moderate,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Traders may be covering short positions
after prices fell to a two-month low.”  Natural gas for September delivery rose 2.3 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.637 per million British thermal units at 1:35
p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures have
declined 12 percent this year.  September gas expires today. The more actively traded
October contract rose 5.1 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.684 per
million Btu.  October $2.25 puts, bets that prices will fall, were the
most active gas options in electronic trading. They were down
0.7 cent to 3.1 cents on volume of 610 contracts at 1:41 p.m.  Gas prices  “could bounce off the weakness we have seen for
the past few days,” said Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke
Associates LLC in Louisville,  Kentucky .  The high in Dallas on Sept. 4 may be 99 degrees Fahrenheit
(37 Celsius), 6 above normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
 State College , Pennsylvania. The high in  Cleveland  may be 84
degrees, 7 more than the usual reading.  Hot July  July was the hottest month in the lower 48 states in
records going back 117 years, capping the warmest 12 months ever
in the continental U.S., the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration  said Aug. 8.  Electricity producers account for about 36 percent of U.S.
gas consumption, according to the Energy Department.  Isaac has shut 67 percent of gas output and 93 percent of
oil production in the  Gulf of Mexico  and forced evacuations from
503 production platforms and 49 rigs, according to the  Bureau of
Safety and Environmental Enforcement .  The Gulf accounted for about 7 percent of U.S. gas
production in 2011, compared with 11 percent in 2008, Energy
Department data show.  Supply Report  An Energy Department report scheduled for release at 10:30
a.m. tomorrow in Washington may show stockpiles gained 65
billion cubic feet in the week ended Aug. 24 to 3.373 trillion,
according to the median of 19 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The five-year average change for the week is 62
billion, department data show.  Inventories were 12 percent above the five-year average in
the week ended Aug. 17, department data show. The supply  surplus 
relative to the five-year average has been declining since
reaching a six-year high of 61 percent on March 30.  Marketed gas production will average a record 68.72 billion
cubic feet a day in 2012, up 3.8 percent from last year, the
Energy Department said Aug. 7 in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook. Output will rise amid rising production from shale
formations, the department said.  The shale gas boom helped the U.S. meet 81 percent of its
energy demand in 2011, the most since 1992, according to
department data compiled by Bloomberg. Shale producers use a
technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which
involves pumping water, sand and chemicals underground to
extract gas embedded in the rock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
