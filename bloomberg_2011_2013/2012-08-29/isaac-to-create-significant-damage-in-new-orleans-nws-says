Hurricane Isaac will cause
significant damage to  New Orleans  as wind and rain lash the city
today, according to Ken Graham, chief meteorologist at the
National Weather Service New Orleans.  “Isaac is skirting the coast and is half-inland, half-
offshore, and as a result, has not weakened,” Graham said in a
telephone interview today. “We’re going to have strong
tropical-storm force winds with hurricane gusts almost all day
today in some areas. You’re going to start losing trees, having
more power outages and more flooding.”  “Once we start looking things over, they’ll be significant
damage to the city, especially from the wind, within the
levees,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
