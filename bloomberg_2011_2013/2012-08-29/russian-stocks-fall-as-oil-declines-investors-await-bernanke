Russian stocks  fell to the lowest in
more than a week, after oil, the nation’s biggest export earner,
declined and as investors await a possible announcement on more
stimulus from the U.S. Federal Reserve.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slipped 0.9 percent to 1,437.14 by
the close in Moscow, the lowest level since Aug. 20, after
adding as much as 0.6 percent earlier. Out of 30 stocks, 28
retreated.  Power (MXRU0UT)  utility stocks slid, with OAO MRSK Holding retreating
5.2 percent and Federal Grid Co. dropping 3.1 percent. Energy
producer OAO Gazprom, the country’s largest company, fell 0.6
percent, the most in a week. Oil in  New York  dropped from its
highest close in more than a week, sinking 1.4 percent to $94.96
a barrel.  Brent crude  declined 0.3 percent to $112.27 a barrel.  Investors may not receive signals of more stimulus from Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  during a speech at a symposium in
 Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , at the end of the week, according to
 Kingsmill Bond , Citigroup Inc’s chief strategist for Russia.  “The market is looking forward to the Jackson Hole
speech,” Citi’s Bond said by telephone. “Citi is a bit
skeptical about the possibility of more easing measures.”  Metal producers OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  and OAO Magnitogorsk Iron &
Steel lost 2.8 percent and 3.6 percent respectively.  Commodities Retreat  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index dropped 0.3 percent to 666.84,
heading for the lowest since Aug. 15. Most metals declined on
the London Metal Exchange, including tin, copper and aluminium.  OAO Mobile TeleSystems tumbled 1.6 percent to 240.91
rubles, the most in more than a week. Russia’s biggest mobile
telephone company reported a $1.08 billion writedown on Uzbek
assets yesterday. That raised concern the company will cut
dividends, UralSib Financial Corp. said in a note to investors
today.  OAO Severstal dropped 1.9 percent to 376.10 rubles, the
lowest level since Aug. 3.  Russia ’s second-largest steel
producer by output said second-quarter earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 18 percent to $664
million from a quarter earlier, missing the average estimate of
10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Easing Announcement  Russian stocks pared losses after data showed U.S. gross
domestic product climbed at a 1.7 percent annual rate from April
through June, up from an initial estimate of 1.5 percent.  “If we get the easing announcement from Bernanke, it’ll be
a major catalyst for the market,” Tom Mundy, chief strategist
at Otkritie Capital in Moscow, said in an interview yesterday.
“There’s still room for the market to move, it’s not priced
in.”  OAO Rostelecom, Russia’s dominant long-distance phone
operator, rose 0.2 percent to 125.48 rubles. The company
announces second-quarter earnings tomorrow.  Russian equities trade at the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.3
 times estimated earnings  after gaining 2.6 percent this year.
That compares with 10 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index,
which has added 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
