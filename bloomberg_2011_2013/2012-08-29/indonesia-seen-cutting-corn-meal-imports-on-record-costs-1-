Soybean-meal and corn imports by
 Indonesia  may decline this year as meat producers struggle to
cope with record prices of the feed ingredients and the
government limits grain purchases, according to a millers’ group.  Meal imports will probably drop to about 2.2 million to 2.3
million metric tons, from 2.4 million to 2.5 million tons in
2011, Desianto Budi Utomo, secretary-general of the Indonesian
Feed Mills Association, said in an interview. Corn imports may
drop to 1.5 million tons from 3.1 million tons, he said today.  Soybean meal, mixed with grains to make feeds for poultry
and pigs, and corn surged to all-time highs in  Chicago  this
month as the worst U.S. drought in half a century cut supplies
of oilseeds and grains. The surge raised  global food costs  and
prompted speculation importers will be forced to cut purchases
in so-called demand destruction, or seek cheaper alternatives.
Indonesia is the world’s largest soybean-meal importer.  Indonesia’s soybean-meal purchases from  India , the fourth-
largest shipper, will probably increase 20 percent to 25 percent
this year from about 350,000 tons in 2011, as feed-millers seek
cheaper alternatives to U.S. supplies, Utomo said today.  Cassava, Bran  Most-active soybean meal, which peaked at $531.90 per 2,000
pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade on Aug. 27, traded at
$522.30 at 11:17 a.m. in  Singapore , 67 percent higher this year.
Soybeans reached $17.605 a bushel on Aug. 27, the most expensive
ever. Corn rallied to a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10.  Indonesian millers are replacing some soybean meal with
cheaper substitutes, including meat-bone meal, Utomo said in
Phuket. Millers are mixing more cassava and rice bran into feed
to cut the use of corn after the government imposed limits on
imports to encourage farmers to boost planting, he said.  Indonesia may import 3.2 million tons of soybean meal in
the 2012-2013 season compared with 3.07 million tons in 2011-
2012, according to a forecast from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . That makes it the largest single-country buyer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
