Facebook Inc. (FB)  received approval from
the California Department of Corporations for its planned
acquisition of Instagram Inc., helping clear the way for the
world’s most popular social network to complete the purchase.  Facebook can issue shares to buy the mobile photo-sharing
application, said Rafael Lirag, hearing officer at a fairness
hearing in San Francisco today. The deal is “fair, just and
equitable,” and a permit will be issued to enable the share
transfer, he said.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted antitrust
approval for the acquisition last week. The deal, which includes
about 23 million shares and $300 million in cash, is valued at
about $740 million.  Facebook is buying Instagram to bolster its presence on
mobile devices, where it needs to boost advertising dollars.
Facebook gets more than half of its users from wireless devices
such as smartphones and tablets, yet growth in mobile
advertising hasn’t kept pace with the surge in members.  Shares of Facebook, based in  Menlo Park , California, fell
1.2 percent to $19.10 at the close in  New York . The stock has
dropped 50 percent from an initial public offering price of $38
in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
