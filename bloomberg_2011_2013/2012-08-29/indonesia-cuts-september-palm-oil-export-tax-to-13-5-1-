Indonesia  will cut its tax on
exports of crude  palm oil  to 13.5 percent in September, the
lowest rate this year, from 15 percent this month as prices of
the commodity declined.  The base price for calculating the levy will be cut to $918
per metric ton, Deddy Saleh, director general of foreign trade
at the Trade Ministry, said in an e-mailed statement today. That
compares with a base price of $950 in August.  Indonesia, the worldâ€™s largest palm oil producer, reviews
the tax rates and base export prices every month, based on
average rates in  Kuala Lumpur , Rotterdam and Jakarta. Palm oil
on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, the global benchmark, has
fallen 5.4 percent this year as the sovereign debt crisis in
 Europe  and a slowdown in  China  reduced demand for cooking oils.  The government will keep the tax for cocoa-bean exports
unchanged at 5 percent in September, while the base price will
be raised to $2,087 a ton from $1,950, Saleh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
