(Corrects amount of bailout fund to 18 billion euros in
final paragraph.)  Euro-region finance ministers will
work out details of a plan to bring down bond spreads at a
meeting in Cyprus this month, Spanish Finance Minister Luis de Guindos said.  The  European Central Bank , which has signaled it may act to
support European Union bond buying, knows that the wide
differences between euro-region bond yields disrupts its ability
to manage monetary policy, de Guindos told reporters in Madrid.  Spain  is not in talks with European Union officials about
implementing further budget cutting measures, and plans to meet
its fiscal targets whether the ECB intervenes or not, de Guindos
said.  The decision of the regional government of Catalonia to
request 5 billion euros in aid from a Spanish bailout mechanism
wonâ€™t strain its finances as the Catalan request was considered
when setting up the 18 billion-euro ($23 billion) fund, de
Guindos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
