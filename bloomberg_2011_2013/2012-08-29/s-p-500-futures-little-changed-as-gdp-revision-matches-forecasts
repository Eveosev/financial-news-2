U.S. stock-index futures remained
little changed after government data showed gross domestic
product expanded more than previously estimated last quarter,
matching economists’ estimates for 1.7 percent growth.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than
0.1 percent to 1,408.00 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York .  Second-quarter GDP growth was revised from an initial
estimate of 1.5 percent, Commerce Department data showed,
reflecting an improvement in the trade deficit and pickup in
household spending on utilities.  The  S&P 500  last week climbed to its highest level on an
intraday basis in more than four years, then failed to close at
that milestone.  The index has fluctuated near the 1,400 level for three
weeks as trading slowed toward the end of the U.S. summer and
investors awaited the  Federal Reserve ’s annual gathering in
 Jackson Hole  to gauge prospects for a possible third round of
so-called quantitative easing through asset purchases.  A release from the National Association of Realtors today
will show that U.S. pending house sales rose 1 percent in July,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. They declined 1.4
percent in June.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
