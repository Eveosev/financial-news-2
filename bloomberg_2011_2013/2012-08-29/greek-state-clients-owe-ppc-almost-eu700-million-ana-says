Public Power Corp SA (PPC) , Greece’s
biggest electricity provider, faces liquidity problems as the
Greek state and private users owe the company as much as 700
million euros, state-run Athens News Agency reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The Greek state needs to repay a debt of as much as 200
million euros to the company, while private users of PPC’s
services owe the company as much as 500 million euros, ANA said.  Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras and  Public Power 
chairman Arthouros Zervos held a meeting to discuss the
possibilities of a repayment in Athens today, the news agency
reported.  Public Power does not plan to exercise an option to acquire
a 30 percent stake in Depa, the country’s natural gas supplier,
ANA said, citing company officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
