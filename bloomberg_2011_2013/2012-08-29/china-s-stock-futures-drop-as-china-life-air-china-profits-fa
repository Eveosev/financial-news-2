China’s stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to its lowest level in more than three years,
after companies from  Air China Ltd. (601111)  to Zhongjin Gold Co.
reported a decline in first-half profits.  Air China, the nation’s largest international carrier, sank
to its lowest level since March 2009, while Zhongjin Gold, the
third-largest bullion producer by market value, retreated 2.3
percent.  FAW Car Co. (000800) , which makes passenger cars with Volkswagen
AG, declined for a seventh day as the company reported a six-
month loss. Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology
Co. rose 6.4 percent after Japan imported more solar products.  “Third-quarter earnings could also be ugly as the economy
tries to find a bottom,” said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central
China Securities Co. in Shanghai.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 1 percent to 2,053.24 at
the close, the lowest level since Feb. 2, 2009, and wiping out
yesterday’s gain that was the biggest in three weeks. The  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  retreated 1.1 percent to 2,214.81. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong 
dropped 0.3 percent.  Signs China’s economic slowdown is deepening have dragged
the Shanghai Composite down 7.7 percent this quarter, the worst
performer in the world after Cyprus among 93 stock markets
tracked by Bloomberg. The gauge is valued at 9.3 times estimated
earnings, compared with an average multiple of 17.1 for the past
five years, according to  data  tracked by Bloomberg.  The Shanghai index rebounded 0.9 percent yesterday after
 Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019)  said it plans to purchase its own
shares, spurring speculation more state-owned companies will
follow suit. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 0.5 percent in
New York yesterday.  Earnings Slump  Air China retreated 1.8 percent to 4.80 yuan. The carrier
said net income slumped 77 percent from a year earlier in the
first six months because of slowing travel demand, higher fuel
costs and a loss from its stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.  Zhongjin Gold slid 2.3 percent to 14.74 yuan, the most
since July 9, after the company said first-half profit fell 3.1
percent.  FAW Car lost 2.9 percent to 7.75  yuan , capping a seven-day,
18 percent plunge. The company said it posted a loss of 61.4
million yuan ($9.67 million) in the first half.  China’s gross domestic product expanded 7.6 percent last
quarter, the slowest pace in three years, as Europe’s debt
crisis hurt exports and Premier Wen Jiabao’s campaign to cool
consumer and property prices damped domestic demand. Bank of
America Corp. estimates a further slowdown to 7.4 percent in the
three months through September.  Store Sales  Retailers from clothing to computers are reporting weaker
sales growth. Passenger-vehicle sales trailed analysts’
estimates in July. Sportswear seller Li Ning Co. shut 1,200
stores in the first half and department-store chain  Parkson
Retail Group Ltd. (3368) ’s same-store sales rose at less than a quarter
the pace of a year earlier. Gome Electrical Appliances Holding
Ltd. said it would report a first-half loss on lower sales.  Slowing sales growth at retailers show an extra drag on the
second-largest economy after export growth almost stalled in
July and factory output missed forecasts.  At the same time, the country may slow the pace of monetary
policy loosening in the third quarter on concern inflation and
 home prices  may rebound, the official Xinhua  News Agency 
reported yesterday, citing Lian Ping, chief economist at Bank of
Communications Ltd., and Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China
International Capital Corp.  The People’s Bank of China cut  interest rates  in June and
July for the first time since 2008 and has lowered banks’
reserve requirements three times starting in November.  Japan’s Imports  Chinese solar stocks advanced after the Japan Photovoltaic
Energy Association said yesterday the nation’s imports of solar
cells and modules more than tripled in the second quarter.  Shanghai Chaori surged 6.4 percent to 5.53 yuan after
jumping by the 10 percent daily limit yesterday.  EGing
Photovoltaic Technology Co. (600537)  rose 2 percent to 9.24 yuan. Jiangsu
Akcome Solar Science & Technology Co. climbed the maximum 10
percent to 6.50 yuan.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 12.3
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.2. About 5.2
billion shares changed hands in the gauge today, 33 percent
lower than the daily average this year.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 0.3 percent to $33.61
yesterday, snapping a nine-day slump.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
