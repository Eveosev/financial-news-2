The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 1 basis point to 152 as of 8:29
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. prices
show. The gauge is poised for its highest close since Aug. 3,
according to data provider CMA. It is down from 159 on July 31.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1 basis point to 201 as
of 9:19 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The measure
was up about 16 basis points this month and is set for its
highest close since Aug. 7, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index climbed 1 basis point to
160 as of 10:14 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) 
prices show. The benchmark has jumped 12 basis points in the
past week and has traded between 148 and 168 this month, CMA
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
