Near-term crude options fell to the
lowest level since May as  Isaac  weakened to a tropical storm as
it moved inland away from offshore oil production in the U.S.
Gulf Coast and the Labor Day holiday approached.  Implied volatility for options expiring in October, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 27.49 percent at 4:25 p.m. in New York, down
from 28.20 percent yesterday. Bets that prices would fall
accounted for 52 percent of electronic trading today.  “October is starting to get hit with time decay, it’s the
last week in August before a vacation week so volumes are
relatively low and you had a hurricane that kept October
volatility up an extra day,” said Jim Colburn, a vice president
and energy options broker at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York .  The Nymex is closed Sept. 3 for the U.S. Labor Day holiday.
October options will expire Sept. 17.  Crude oil for October delivery fell 84 cents to settle at
$95.49 a barrel on the Nymex.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
October $85 puts, which rose 3 cents to 18 cents a barrel at
4:33 p.m. with 2,982 lots trading. October $110 calls were the
second-most active options, with 1,888 lots changing hands as
they fell 6 cents to 9 cents a barrel. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 51
percent of the 102,830 contracts traded.  December $82 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 5,239 lots changing hands. They fell 10 cents to
$1.30 a barrel. December $120 calls advanced 3 cents to 68 cents
on volume of 4,677.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
45,838 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 43,957 lots
