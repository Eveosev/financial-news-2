An Israeli court ordered the
evacuation of Jewish settlers from an outpost in the  West Bank 
by Sept. 4 because it was illegally built on Palestinian land.  The  High Court  of Justice in  Jerusalem  also said today that
most of the structures must be removed from the area by Sept.
11, according to the ruling sent by e-mail. It postponed the
clearing of one section while the validity of its sale to
settlers is checked.  “After two discussions that we conducted and listening to
the arguments of both sides, we saw no reason to grant this
petition,” the three-judge panel said in its ruling.  Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s administration has been
negotiating with the settlers in the hope of moving them to a
parcel of West Bank land that is not owned by Palestinians.
Netanyahu has sought to draw a distinction between more than 100
settlements authorized by the government and another 100
unauthorized outposts that successive administrations have
sought to evacuate.  The U.S. and most other countries consider all the
settlements built in the West Bank, which Israel captured in the
1967 Middle East war, to be illegal.  Palestinians, who number about 2.5 million in the West
Bank, have been seeking to establish an independent state on the
mountainous territory wedged between Israel and Jordan. The
population of Israeli settlers in the West Bank has grown to
more than 300,000, with another 200,000 living in east
Jerusalem, which was also captured in 1967.  To contact the reporter on this story:
