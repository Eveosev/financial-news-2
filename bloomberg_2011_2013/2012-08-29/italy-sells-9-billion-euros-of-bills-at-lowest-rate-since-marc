Italy sold 9 billion euros ($11.3
billion) of Treasury bills at the lowest rate since March on
optimism the  European Central Bank  will intervene to curb the
country’s borrowing costs.  The Rome-based Treasury sold the 181-day bills at 1.585
percent, down from 2.454 percent at the last sale of similar-
maturity debt on July 27. Investors bid 1.69 times the amount of
bills offered, up from 1.61 times last month.  Italy’s 10-year yield rose 1 basis point to 5.84 basis
points at 11:10 a.m. Rome time, pushing the difference or spread
with similar-maturing German debt to 453 basis points.  The sale comes after the Treasury yesterday priced a zero-
coupon 2014 bond to yield 3.064 percent, down almost 2
percentage points from the last sale a month ago. A bigger test
comes tomorrow, when Italy sells as much as 7.5 billion euros of
five- and 10-year debt.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  opened the
door earlier this month to buying Spanish and Italian
securities, in conjunction with the euro area’s bailout funds.
Draghi is expected to announce details of the new bond-buying
program when the ECB’s Governing Council meets on Sept. 6.  Monti, who has been joined by French President  Francois
Hollande  and Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  in calling for
policies to stimulate growth and lower high borrowing costs,
continues his diplomacy abroad to calm Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis. He’s due to meet later today in Berlin with German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  for talks on the euro crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
