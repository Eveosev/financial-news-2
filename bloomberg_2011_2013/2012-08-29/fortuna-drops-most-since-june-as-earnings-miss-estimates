Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA) , an
eastern European betting company, fell the most in 11 weeks in
Prague trading after reporting first-half profit that missed
analysts’ estimates.  Fortuna dropped as much as 3.7 koruna, or 4 percent to 89.3
koruna, its biggest intraday drop since June 6, and traded at
90.2 koruna as of 12:07 p.m. in Prague.  Net income the first-half declined 35 percent to 5.62
million euros, Fortuna said today in a statement. Ebitda, or
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
declined 15 percent to 10.1 million euros.  “Compared to our projection Ebitda is lower due to higher
operating costs,” J&T Banka AS’ analyst Milan Lavicka wrote in
a note to clients. “The lottery and higher costs are
disappointing. Overall, we consider the results negative.”
Lavicka recommends investors “buy” the stock.  Fortuna, which started a lottery project in the  Czech
Republic  last year, is battling for market share with its
biggest rival Sazka AS, a former state monopoly now run by
financial groups PPF AS and KKCG. The lottery project posted an
operating loss of 3.3 million euros in the first half of 2012,
the company said today.  Fortuna’s gross win for the period advanced 15 percent to
55 million euros helped by the Euro 2012 soccer tournament.  Fortuna, which is controlled by Czech-Slovak private equity
Penta Investments Ltd., provides online betting services and
operates branches in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and  Poland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
