Hurricane Issac is unleashing a
“dangerous  storm surge ” along the northern Gulf Coast, the
National Hurricane Center said in an advisory at 10 p.m. local
time.  Issac is located 75 miles south-southeast of New Orleans and
with top sustained winds of 80 miles per hour. A tropical storm
warning is in effect from west of Cameron, Louisiana, to Sabine
Pass, Texas. The warning replaces an earlier tropical storm
watch, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
