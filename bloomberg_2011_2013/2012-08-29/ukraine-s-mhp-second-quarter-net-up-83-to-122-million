Mironovskiy Hleboproduct SA, a
Ukrainian poultry and grain producer, said second-quarter net
income increased 83 percent on higher chicken prices and
exports.  Net income jumped to $122 million from April through June,
compared with $67 million a year earlier, as the average chicken
price rose by 25 percent, the Kiev, Ukraine-based company, said
today in an e-mailed statement. Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization increased by 45 percent to $147
million, according to the statement.  “We can say that the first half had a very good start and
the annual EBITDA will rise by at least 25 percent to 30
percent,” Chief Financial Officer Viktoria Kapelyushnaya said
in a phone interview in Kiev today. “Chicken-meat prices will
be on par with last year in the second half.”  Chicken exports increased by 30 percent to almost 20,000
metric tons in the first half of the year, from the same period
a year earlier, as the company expanded into African markets, it
said.  MHP expects to harvest grain from 250,000 hectares this
year and its yields of wheat at 5.4 tons per hectare, are almost
twice the average in Ukraine, according to the statement.  A possible hryvnia devaluation after October elections “is
being widely talked about,” Kapelyushnaya said.  “Even with hryvnia devaluation, we have sufficient export
revenue to cover our debt,” she said. “It is not going to
affect our EBITDA. It will affect our net income because we’ll
have losses caused by foreign exchange rates as our debt is in
dollars. Those will be non-cash losses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
