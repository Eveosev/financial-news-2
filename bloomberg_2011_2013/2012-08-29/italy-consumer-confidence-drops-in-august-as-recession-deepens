Italian  consumer confidence  dropped
this month on concerns the country’s fourth recession since 2001
will deepen.  The confidence index declined to 86 from 86.5 in July, the
national statistics office,  Istat , said in Rome today. The drop
matched economists’ forecasts, according to the median of 11
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Italy’s economy contracted for a fourth straight quarter in
the three months through June as manufacturing slumped and the
euro-area debt crisis intensified. Prime Minister  Mario Monti  is
implementing 20 billion euros ($25 billion) in austerity
measures that have curtailed consumer spending, pushed gasoline
prices to record highs and prompted Italy’s largest
manufacturer, Fiat SpA, to curb investment.  Monti’s government forecasts that the euro area’s third-
largest economy will shrink 1.2 percent this year, while
employers lobby Confindustria forecasts a contraction of twice
that pace.  Fiat Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said he will
make a decision about restructuring in Europe, including further
plant closings in Italy, after third-quarter earnings. Any
additional layoffs at Fiat, the company’s biggest employer,
could further hit Italy’s jobless rate, already at the highest
level in almost 13 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
