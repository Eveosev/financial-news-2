Asian demand for refined oil
products strengthened since the start of the year, according to
tanker company Frontline 2012 Ltd., controlled by billionaire
 John Fredriksen .  Demand for  fuel oil  and other products increased because of
“post-tsunami additions” to Japan and industrial expansion in
Korea, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company said today in a
statement. European usage remains “relatively bleak,”
reflecting a regional economic slowdown, the company said.
Higher unemployment contributed to a slump in European gasoline
demand, it said.  Global distillate demand is set to build next year as
construction and manufacturing begin to strengthen, the company
said, citing the Paris-based  International Energy Agency .  Frontline 2012 reported second-quarter net income of $6
million, or 5 cents a share, on sales of $40.8 million. The
company was formed in December when Fredriksen split oil-tanker
company Frontline Ltd. in two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
