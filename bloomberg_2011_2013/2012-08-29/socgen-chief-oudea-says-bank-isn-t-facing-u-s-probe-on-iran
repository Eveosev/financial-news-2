Societe Generale SA (GLE)  Chief Executive
Officer  Frederic Oudea  said the French bank isn’t being probed
by the U.S. on Iran.  “Today to my knowledge no inquiry regarding SocGen in
Iran” is being made by U.S. authorities such as the Office of
Foreign Assets Control or the U.S. Treasury, Oudea said today in
a Bloomberg Television interview near Versailles, France.  Societe Generale has stopped all activities related to
Iran, the CEO confirmed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
