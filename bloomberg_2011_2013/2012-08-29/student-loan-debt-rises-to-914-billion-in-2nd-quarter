Debt from educational loans in the U.S. rose 1.1 percent to $914 billion in the second quarter, according to the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York .  Outstanding student debt increased from $904 billion three months earlier, the  New York Fed  said today in a report. The loans were taken out by students and their parents, and the majority are backed by the U.S. government.  Ninety-day delinquency rates for student loans increased to 8.9 percent from 8.69 percent in the first quarter, the New York Fed said. Since the peak in  household debt  in the third quarter of 2008, student-loan debt has increased by $303 billion, while other forms of debt fell a combined $1.6 trillion.  The loan totals are based on figures from a nationally representative random sample provided by the  Equifax Inc. (EFX)  credit bureau.  The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated in March that student debt reached the $1 trillion mark. About 15 percent of the debt is private, issued by banks and other lenders.
