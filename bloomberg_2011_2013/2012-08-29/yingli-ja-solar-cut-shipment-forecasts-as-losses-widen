Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  and
 JA Solar Holdings Co. Ltd. (JASO) , two of the top four solar-cell
makers, cut forecasts for shipments after losses at the Chinese
manufacturers widened and prices of their products plunged.  Yingli expects to ship 2,100 megawatts to 2,200 megawatts
of photovoltaic panels this year, according to a statement
today, down from a May forecast of 2,400 megawatts to 2,500
megawatts. JA Solar said it will ship 1,500 megawatts to 1,800
megawatts in 2012, compared with its earlier forecast of as much
as 2,000 megawatts.  Chinese companies that dominate manufacturing of solar
panels ramped up production in recent years, driving down prices
as governments across  Europe  reduced incentives for the
technology. The result increased losses and debt, adding to
speculation some companies will need bailouts or bankruptcy
protection to survive.  “Clearly, there’s a sustained trend here where overall
demand for the second half of the year is shaping up weaker than
many companies had hoped,”  Pavel Molchanov , an analyst at
Raymond James & Associates in Houston, said in an interview
today. “Whether it gets worse is debatable because it’s truly
about as bad as it can get. It’s more about how long it’s going
to stay this way.”  Loss Doubles  JA Solar, based in  Shanghai , said its net loss doubled to
457.8 million  yuan  ($72.1 million) in the second quarter, or
2.34 yuan an American depositary receipt, from 228.9 million
yuan, or 1.39 yuan an ADR, a year earlier. Shipments were 418
megawatts in the quarter and are expected to increase to between
350 megawatts and 370 megawatts in the current quarter.  “In the second quarter, market conditions in the solar
industry remained challenging,” JA Solar Chief Executive
Officer Fang Peng said today on a conference call with analysts.  JA Solar ADRs, each worth one ordinary share, fell 10
percent to 96 cents at the close in  New York . Yingli’s ADRs,
each worth one share, dropped 5.1 percent to $1.85.  Yingli, based in Baoding, had a loss of 573 million yuan,
or 3.66 yuan an ADR, compared with net income of 375.6 million
yuan, or 2.34 yuan an ADR, in the second quarter of 2011.
Shipments rose 13.7 percent in the second quarter from the prior
quarter, the company said in the statement, without giving the
number of panels shipped, and it expects a “significant
increase of demand in  China  in the second half of the year.”  Yingli faced “challenging market conditions” during the
quarter, leading inventories to rise to $601.5 million from
$395.5 million in the same period last year, Chief Financial
Officer Li Zongwei said today on a conference call.  Higher shipments in the quarter “failed to contribute to
revenue increases due to an industrywide decline” in pricing.  Prices for solar panels  fell  36 percent industrywide in the
past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JA Solar was
the largest maker of solar cells in 2011, followed by Suntech
Power Holdings Co.,  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  and Yingli.  To contact the reporters on this story:
