Eurazeo SA (RF) , the French investment
firm that owns a stake in hotel group  Accor SA (AC) , said its net
loss widened in the first half of the year because of the sale
of Motel 6 and restructuring costs.  The loss increased to 126.6 million euros ($158.9 million)
in the six months to June, from 106.3 million euros a year
earlier, the Paris-based firm said in a statement today. The
firm suffered a 54.1 million-euro loss when Accor disposed of
U.S. budget hotel chain Motel 6 to Blackstone Group LP in May.  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis has slowed asset sales and
hampered the ability of companies owned by Eurazeo to grow.
Like-for-like revenue for Eurazeo’s portfolio companies advanced
2.6 percent during the period, the firm said. The companies
fully consolidated by Eurazeo, which include parking-lot
operator Apcoa, car rental specialist Europcar and cleaning-
services provider Elis SA, narrowed their operating loss to 1.8
million euros from 37.6 million euros after Eurazeo lowered the
cost of their debt.  “Eurazeo actively engaged in consolidation of group
companies’ balance sheets during the first half of 2012,” Chief
Executive Officer Patrick Sayer said in the statement. “As a
consequence, the net recurrent result is close to stable.”  Separately, Eurazeo’s real estate developer,  ANF
Immobilier (ANF) , said today it received offers totaling 816.6 million
euros for some of its properties.  Fonciere des Murs (FMU)  SCA and La
Francaise REM have bid about 503.5 million euros for 160 B&B
brand hotels, ANF Immobilier said in a statement. Grosvenor
Group Ltd., the U.K. real estate firm owned by the family trust
of Britain’s Duke of Westminster, offered to buy a “substantial
share” of ANF Immobilier’s residential and commercial buildings
in Lyon,  France , for about 313.1 million euros.  Eurazeo’s net asset value a share fell to 53.9 euros as of
Aug. 22, from 57.2 euros on March 8. Net asset value stood at
51.7 euros as of June 30, Eurazeo said.  The  stock  rose 0.17 percent to 35.6 euros at 15:43 p.m. in
Paris, giving the company a market value of 2.5 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
