ANF Immobilier (ANF) , the French real
estate developer and largest owner of buildings on the city of
Lyon’s main shopping street, said it received offers totaling
816.6 million euros ($1 billion) for some of its properties.  Fonciere des Murs SCA  and La Francaise REM have bid about
503.5 million euros for 160 B&B brand hotels, ANF Immobilier
said in a statement today. Grosvenor Group Ltd., the U.K. real
estate firm owned by the family trust of Britain’s Duke of
Westminster, offered to buy a “substantial share” of ANF
Immobilier’s residential and commercial buildings in Lyon for
about 313.1 million euros.  ANF Immobilier, based in Paris, said it’s in exclusive
talks with both potential buyers and may complete the sales by
November. The company, which sells newly built or renovated
properties to fund new projects, said sale proceeds would allow
it to invest in additional developments in Marseille and Lyon,
and to expand its business in  Bordeaux , where it began
operations last year.  “On completion of these disposals, ANF Immobilier will
retain substantial resources ensuring its future growth,” the
company said in the statement.  Fonciere des Murs (FMU)  is a sale-and-leaseback real estate firm
run by Fonciere des Regions SA. La Francaise REM is a closely
held asset manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
