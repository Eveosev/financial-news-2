Coffee stored at  New Orleans 
warehouses owned by Dupuy Storage & Forwarding LLC escaped
damage from Hurricane Isaac, according to Kevin Colley, a
company vice president.  Isaac dumped “lots of rain and wind, but no flooding in
the city,” Colley said today in an e-mailed response to
questions from Bloomberg News. “We have checked our coffee
warehouses via remote cameras, and everything is fine.”  Dupuy held about 150,000 bags of coffee, each weighing 60
kilograms, or 132 pounds, according to Colley. About 17 percent
of all U.S. green-coffee stockpiles were stored in New Orleans
as of July 31, according to the New York-based Green Coffee
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
