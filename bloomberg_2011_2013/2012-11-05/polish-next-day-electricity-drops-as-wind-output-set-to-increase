Polish day-ahead electricity fell as
renewable output was set to climb amid forecasts for more wind.  Next-day power  in  Poland  declined 3.5 percent to 172.35
zloty ($53.47) a megawatt-hour, according to exchange data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Wind speeds are set to be 31 kilometers (19 miles) per hour
tomorrow in Warsaw, more than double the average of the last
five years, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.
Flows of Polish electricity to the  Czech Republic  and Slovakia,
where prices declined, were projected to increase, data from the
grid manager PSE Operator SA showed.  Next-day electricity on the coupled markets of the Czech
Republic and Slovakia dropped 5 percent to 43.47 euros ($55.58)
a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countriesâ€™
market operators. The day-ahead contract in  Hungary  settled 4.8
percent lower at 43.58 euros a megawatt-hour in a daily auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
