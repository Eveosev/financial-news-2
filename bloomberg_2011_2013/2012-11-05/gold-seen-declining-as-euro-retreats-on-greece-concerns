Gold futures in  New York  gained the
most in a week as demand climbed in  China , the world’s largest
buyer after India.  China’s imports of gold from  Hong Kong  in September climbed
30 percent from August and were 23 percent more than a year
earlier, data from the Census and Statistics Department of the
Hong Kong government showed today. The price fell 3.1 percent
last month, the first decline since May.  “Physical demand is improving,” Walter de Wet, the head
of commodities research at Standard Bank Plc, said in a report
e-mailed today.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,683.20 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Oct. 25.
Earlier, prices fell to $1,672.50, the lowest since Aug. 31.  Holdings in exchange-traded funds backed by bullion totaled
a record 2,589.516 metric tons on Nov. 2, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for December delivery advanced 0.9 percent
to $31.128 an ounce in New York.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery slid 0.1 percent to close at $1,542.70 an
ounce, declining for the third straight session. Palladium
futures for December delivery advanced 0.6 percent to $603 an
