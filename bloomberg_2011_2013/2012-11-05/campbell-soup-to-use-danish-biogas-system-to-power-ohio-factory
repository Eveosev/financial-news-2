Campbell Soup Co. (CPB) , whose cans were
transformed into artworks by Andy Warhol, plans to turn potato
peel and tomato waste into biogas to power its Ohio factory.  Bigadan A/S  will build a biogas plant to process waste from
the factory in Napoleon, said Eksport Kredit Fonden, the Danish
export credit agency guaranteeing a loan for the venture. The
project will cost more than 75 million kroner ($13 million).  “This new biogas technology will improve Campbell’s
Napoleon recycling rate to approximately 95 percent,” Dave Stangis, a Campbell Soup official, said in a EKF statement.  The technology will provide a quarter of the plant’s annual
power, while curbing greenhouse gas emissions by about 16,000
metric tons a year, equivalent to the output of 3,000 cars. EKF,
based in Copenhagen, guaranteed a loan from an unspecified bank
in  Denmark  to Napoleon Biogas LLC to construct the project.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
