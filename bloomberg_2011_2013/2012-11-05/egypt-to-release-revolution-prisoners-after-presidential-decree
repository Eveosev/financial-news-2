Egypt ’s prosecutor-general, Abdel-
Meguid Mahmoud, ordered the release of most prisoners involved
in last year’s uprising against former President  Hosni Mubarak ,
his office said in a faxed statement today.  The decision follows a decree issued by President Mohamed
Mursi last month to pardon those arrested between the start of
the uprising in January 2011 and 30 June this year, it said.
Prisoners accused of murder, looting and causing damage to
buidings and public facilities are excluded from the pardon, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
