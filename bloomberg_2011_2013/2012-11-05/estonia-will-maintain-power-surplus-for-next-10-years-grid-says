Estonia  will maintain a power surplus
for the next 10 years, even during peak winter demand, while
neighbors such as  Lithuania  strive for electricity independence
and lower prices, the country’s grid operator said.  The northernmost of the Baltic nations, Estonia will have
2,042 megawatts of net available production this winter, more
than enough to meet demand, even if average weekly temperatures
are below minus 17 degrees Celsius (1 Fahrenheit) during the
country’s October-March cold season, Elering AS said.  “Estonian peakload demand could reach 1,640 megawatts, or
even more than 1,700 megawatts during an especially cold
winter,” the company said today in a  report on its website .
Peakload demand in the next 10 years is set to grow by 1.8
percent annually to as much as 2,000 megawatts by 2022, leaving
a surplus margin in supplies of 250 megawatts or more, it said.  Lithuania suffers from an energy deficit and imported 75
percent of its power use in the second quarter, according to
data from Elering. Reliance on imports has pushed Lithuania’s
average  power price  to 40.29 euros ($51.51) a megawatt-hour so
far this month, the highest on the the Nord Pool Spot AS
exchange in Oslo, compared with 37.87 euros for Estonia and
34.32 euros for the  Nordic countries , according to data from the
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
