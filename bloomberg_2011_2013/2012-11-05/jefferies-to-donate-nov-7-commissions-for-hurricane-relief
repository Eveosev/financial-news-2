Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  will donate all
of its trading commissions from Nov. 7 to relief efforts for
people affected by Hurricane Sandy.  Employees worldwide will also be given the opportunity to
contribute their salary for that day, and the New York-based
firm will separately donate $1 million, Jefferies said today in
a statement.  “The people affected by this disaster are our families,
our neighbors and our communities and we all feel their pain and
suffering from these tragic events,” Richard B. Handler,
Jefferies’s chairman and chief executive officer, said in the
statement. “While we know that there are massive relief efforts
under way, it is our goal to help in this small way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
