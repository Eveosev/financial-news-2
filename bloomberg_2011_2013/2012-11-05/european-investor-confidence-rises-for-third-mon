European investor confidence rose for
a third month in November as the  European Central Bank ’s bond-
purchase plan calmed financial markets, the Sentix research
institute said.  An  index  measuring sentiment in the euro-area economy
increased to minus 18.8 from minus 22.2 in October, the Limburg,
Germany-based institute said in an e-mailed statement today.
Economists had forecast a gain to minus 21, according to the
median of 11  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey. A gauge of
economic expectations rose to minus 5.5 from minus 9, while a
measure of current conditions climbed to minus 31.3 from minus
34.5, Sentix said.  “The past weeks were rather quiet but the absence of new
negative news about the euro-region crisis may have made
investors more confident,”  Sebastian Wanke , senior analyst at
Sentix, said in the statement. Investors may also be “more
confident that the measures designed by ECB President  Mario Draghi  in the summer will show their effect,” he said.  Draghi pledged in July to do whatever it takes to preserve
the euro. European officials are now waiting for  Spain , whose
economy contracted for a fifth quarter in the three months
through September, to request a full-fledged bailout after the
country already secured 100 billion euros ($128 billion) to
recapitalize its banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
