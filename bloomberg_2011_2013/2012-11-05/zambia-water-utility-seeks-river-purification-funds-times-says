Kafubu Water and Sewage Co. is
seeking about $1.1 million in funding to start purifying river
water in Ndolaby, the Times of Zambia said, citing an interview
with the acting managing director.  Funding for equipment including a dredger to clear weeds
and matter from the Kafubu River would control flooding, improve
pipe works and boost efforts to supply more drinking water for
residents, Kafubu Water acting managing director Athanasius
Mwaba told the newspaper. He said the water utility had
submitted proposals to the government and the Danish
International Development Agency to help fund the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
