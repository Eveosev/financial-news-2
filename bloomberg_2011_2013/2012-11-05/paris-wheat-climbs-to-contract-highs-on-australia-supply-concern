Paris-traded milling wheat futures
rose to contract highs amid concern that supplies from  Australia 
and Argentina will be smaller than expected, boosting demand for
French exports.  Wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris
rose 0.2 percent to 269.25 euros ($344.21) a metric ton by the
close in Paris, the highest closing price since the contract
started trading in May 2011.  Australia’s wheat crop may fall 30 percent to 20.8 million
tons in 2012-13 on a lack of rain, according to the median in a
Bloomberg survey of six analysts and traders. That’s 2.2 million
tons less than forecast by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  “We were counting on Australia and Argentina to bring
relief to the market,” said Paul Gaffet, a wheat analyst at
Bourges, France-based farm adviser Offre & Demande Agricole, by
phone. “In Australia, the conditions in the west are worse than
in 2007.”  Heavy rain is delaying all crops in  Argentina , and wheat
may be damaged by disease, the Rosario Cereals Exchange said
last week. Argentina’s wheat exports will drop to 7 million tons
in 2012-13 from 11.4 million tons in 2011-12, the International
Grains Council forecasts.  “We’ve been facing the Southern Hemisphere menace for a
while, and they were selling aggressively,” said Pierre Raye,
an analyst at Union InVivo, a French grain cooperative. “Now
we’re seeing a lack of availability in those countries,
particularly Argentina.”  Milling wheat for March delivery advanced 0.2 percent to
268.25 euros a ton, while the May contract rose by the same
percentage to 267.50 euros. Wheat for delivery in November 2013,
after next year’s harvest, advanced 0.5 percent to 244 euros a
ton. All three contracts closed at lifetime highs.  France ’s soft wheat exports outside the European Union may
climb to 9.5 million tons in the year through June 2013 from 8.4
million tons in 2011-12, crop office FranceAgriMer predicts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
