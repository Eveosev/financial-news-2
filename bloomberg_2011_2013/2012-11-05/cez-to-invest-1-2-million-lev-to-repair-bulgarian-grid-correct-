(Corrects currency conversion in first paragraph.)  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the largest Czech power
producer, will invest 1.2 million lev ($787,600) this month to
replace cables in western Bulgaria including the capital Sofia,
the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Prague-based utility invested 1.7 billion lev in
Bulgaria since 2005, when it bought the power distributors
serving 2 million customers, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
