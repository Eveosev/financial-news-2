The Brazilian government isn’t
considering changing its utilities concession renewal plan, a
government official who participated in the plan said.  The country’s government believes the plan allows companies
sufficient revenues to pay for maintenance, the official who
couldn’t be named because of internal policy, said in Brasilia.  Today,  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) , known as
Eletrobras, lost 8.2 percent in trading, while   Cia Energetica
de Sao Paulo (CESP6) , or Cesp, fell 5.8 percent and  Cia de Transmissao
de Energia Eletrica Paulista , known as Cteep, lost 4.2 percent.  The government proposed paying generation and transmission
companies about 19 billion reais ($9.4 billion) for the renewal
of concessions due to end between 2015 and 2017.  Eletrobras was expecting compensation of almost 30 billion
reais for their assets, said president Jose da Costa Carvalho Neto on Oct. 31, one day before the company knew that the
government proposed to pay 14 billion reais for them to accept
the new terms.  The government used a globally accepted method to calculate
the compensation based on the current value of assets and
depreciation, the official said.  The government expects that the market will keep investing
in electric power generation in  Brazil  because the country’s
economic boom means that more dams will be needed, the official
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
