Enel SpA (ENEL) , Italy’s biggest utility,
had its  credit rating  cut by Moody’s Investors Service to Baa2
from Baa1 on concerns falling demand is hurting profit margins.  “Whilst Moody’s expects the company to continue to take
measures to limit the impact on its financial profile, these are
unlikely to be sufficient to counter the increased risks and
pressures,” Moody’s said yesterday in a statement.  Enel, based in Rome, has invested in developing markets to
offset weaker performance in its home economy and Spain, where
the economic crisis has curbed power demand. Moody’s cited
“heightened macroeconomic, political and regulatory
challenges” for utilities in Spain and Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
