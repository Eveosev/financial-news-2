El Salvador’s credit rating was cut
by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited the Central American
nation’s weak economic growth and debt ratios.  Moody’s lowered the country’s rating one level to Ba3,
three levels below investment grade and the same as Bolivia and
 Portugal , according to an e-mailed statement today.  El Salvador’s economic growth has averaged 1 percent over
the past five years, compared with 2.8 percent in the previous
five years, on low and declining investment ratios, Moody’s
said. The country’s debt-to-gross domestic product ratio was
forecast by Moody’s to remain at about 53 percent of GDP this
year.  “Since growth prospects remain weak and the government has
a challenging outlook in the years to come, it will be difficult
to reduce debt ratios,” the report said.  The economy will expand about 1.3 percent this year and 2.3
percent in 2013, Moody’s said.  “Given the economy’s vulnerability to shocks, risks are
weighted to the downside,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
