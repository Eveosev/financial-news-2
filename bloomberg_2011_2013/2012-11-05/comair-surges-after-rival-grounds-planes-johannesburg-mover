Comair Ltd. (COM) , which operates two South
African airlines, climbed the most in more than six months after
low-cost flier and rival carrier  1Time Holdings Ltd. (1TM)  grounded
its planes and filed for bankruptcy.  Johannesburg-based Comair  rose  10.3 percent to 1.60 rand by
3:42 p.m. in Johannesburg after increasing as much as 17.2
percent, or the most in more than a year, earlier today. About
2.8 million shares changed hands, or 18 times the daily average
over the past three months.  “Investors are speculating that Kulula.com and  British
Airways (IAG)  stand to benefit from 1Time’s closure,” Ryan Wibberley,
an equity trader at Investec Asset Management, said by phone
from  Cape Town . Comair is the owner of Kulula.com and the South
Africa franchise operator for British Airways, part of
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.  1Time, which owned a low-cost flier and a technical
maintenance company, was placed under business rescue
proceedings on Aug. 21 and filed for liquidation on Nov. 2. Its
shares were suspended today.  Comair’s 30-day historical volatility, a measure of stock
swings, increased to 50.71 from 42.12 the previous trading day.
The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s 30-day volatility measure
was at 11.27 against 11.33 the previous day. A higher reading
means the price of an asset may move dramatically in a short
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
