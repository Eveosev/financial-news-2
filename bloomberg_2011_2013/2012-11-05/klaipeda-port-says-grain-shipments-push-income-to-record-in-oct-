Lithuania’s  Port of Klaipeda , the
northernmost ice-free port on the eastern coast of the Baltic
Sea, said it collected the most fees ever in October mainly due
to a surge in grain shipments.  Revenue from port services totaled 13.3 million litai ($4.9
million) in October, more than any month in the port’s history,
port authority head of finance Martynas Armonaitis said at a
news conference today, according to a video on the company’s
website. Income in the first 10 months of 2012 was 119 million
litai, or 2.7 percent percent more than in the year-ago period.  Grain shipments via Klaipeda have increased 74 percent so
far this year to 1.2 million tons, making year-on-year revenue
growth positive again since July after declines in the first
half of the year, Armonaitis said. Besides agriculture products,
the port also handles chemical fertilizers, crude oil, oil
products and metals, according to its website.  A total 4.1 million tons of cargo was handled in October,
0.9 percent more than in the same month of 2011, including
905,169 tons of crude oil imported through the Butinge terminal,
which is part of the Lithuanian unit of  Poland ’s PKN Orlen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
