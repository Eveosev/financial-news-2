Australia’s dollar strengthened after
a report today showed gains in retail sales in September
exceeded economist estimates while the nation’s trade deficit
was smaller than expected.  The so-called Aussie rose versus all 16 major peers before
 Reserve Bank  of Australia officials hold a policy meeting
tomorrow. Demand for Australia’s currency and its  New Zealand 
counterpart was tempered as investors curbed bids on higher-
yielding assets before the  U.S. presidential election  this week.  “Today’s data was a little bit better than expected, and
the Aussie might see a modest boost here,” said  Joseph Capurso ,
a currency strategist in Sydney at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia (CBA) , the nation’s largest lender. “It’s not going to
change the picture greatly for the risk of an RBA rate cut
tomorrow. But we also acknowledge that it’s going to be a very
close call.”  Australia’s dollar climbed 0.3 percent to $1.0367 as of
5:13 p.m. in Sydney. The currency gained 0.3 percent to 83.34
yen. Its New Zealand peer was at 82.62 U.S. cents after dropping
0.2 percent to 82.52 on Nov. 2. The kiwi bought 66.42 yen from
66.36 at the end of last week.  CBA predicts policy makers will cut borrowing costs by 25
basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 3 percent tomorrow,
Capurso said.  The yield on  Australia ’s 10-year note fell two basis points
to 3.16 percent. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed
payment made to receive floating rates, was little changed at
2.69 percent.  Retail, Trade  Australian  retail sales  climbed 0.5 percent in September
from the previous month, the statistics bureau said in a report
today. The median prediction in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists was a 0.4 percent gain. The  trade deficit  was A$1.46
billion ($1.51 billion) in the same period from a revised A$1.88
billion in August, according to a separate release. Forecasters
projected a A$1.55 billion shortfall.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg indicate
traders see a 54 percent chance RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  will
lower the overnight cash rate target by 25 basis points
tomorrow. That compares with a 64 percent probability seen on
Oct. 29, the data show. Twenty of 27 economists in a Bloomberg
 survey  forecast a quarter-percentage point reduction.  Net Longs  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a rise in the Australian dollar
compared with those on a decline -- so-called net longs -- was
at 52,090 on Oct. 30, figures from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. That compares with
a 1 1/2-year high of 89,562 in the period ended Sept. 25. Net
long positions for  New Zealand’s currency  were at 16,745 in the
same period from 16,349 a week earlier, the data show.  The Aussie dropped 3.7 percent in the past three months,
the worst performance after the yen among the 10 developed-
nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The kiwi fell 0.6 percent.  Americans are set to choose a leader amid growing debt
levels and the approaching fiscal cliff, as the more-than $600
billion of federal spending cuts and tax increases that will
take effect at the start of next year unless Congress acts is
known. Voters tomorrow will choose which of President  Barack Obama  and challenger  Mitt Romney  will steer the economy over the
next four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
