Thailand’s baht dropped to a one-
month low as investors sought the relative safety of the dollar
ahead of the  U.S. presidential election  tomorrow.  Government
bonds  were little changed.  The  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia Pacific Index of shares fell while the Dollar
Index, which tracks the greenback against the currencies of six
major trading partners, touched a two-month high. A Nov. 2
report showed hiring in the U.S. rose more than forecast in
October, the last employment data before voters decide between
giving President Barack Obama another four years in office or
changing course with Republican Mitt Romney. Romney has said he
wouldn’t appoint Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to a
third term.  “Investors may prefer the dollar as a safe-haven asset
before the election,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-
exchange trader at  Bangkok Bank Pcl. (BBL)  “If Obama wins, Bernanke
will stay and it won’t affect much in terms of the Fed policy.
But for now, it’s very difficult to say what will happen.”  The baht slumped 0.1 percent to 30.77 per dollar as of 8:33
a.m. in Bangkok after touching 30.89 earlier, the weakest level
since Oct. 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 4.27 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2017 held
steady at 3.02 percent from Nov. 2, when it reached its lowest
level since January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
