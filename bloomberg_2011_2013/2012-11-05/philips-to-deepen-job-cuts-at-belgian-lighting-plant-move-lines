Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIA)  said it
will deepen cuts at a lighting factory in  Belgium  and eliminate
an an additional 218 jobs in response to falling demand for
conventional lamps and the rise of light-emitting diodes.  The job cuts are on top of 136 reductions announced in
June, Amsterdam-based Philips said in a statement today. The
site in Turnhout, Belgium, has 1,533 employees and makes high-
pressure discharge lamps for sport stadiums and stores.  “The need to focus on cost efficiency is becoming more and
more important,” Alasdair Waugh, director at the site, said in
a statement. “We expect a decrease of production volumes in the
next two years.”  The company, the world’s largest maker of lighting
equipment, is also moving two production lines to  Shanghai  to
save costs. The cuts are part of a companywide overhaul
involving 6,700 reductions to realize 1.1 billion euros in
savings ($1.4 billion).  Sales of LED products at Philips rose 51 percent in the
third quarter and made up 24 percent of total lighting sales.
The company expects 45 percent of general lighting sales to come
from LEDs by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
