Power for delivery in January through
March in the Nordic region fell to the lowest in more than five
weeks as forecasts for mild weather pointed to lower demand as
the year’s coldest months approach.  Electricity for delivery in the first quarter of 2012
retreated 1.1 percent to 40.10 euros ($51.27) a megawatt-hour on
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo, the lowest
since Sept. 25.  “The contract must approach 39 euros before we consider it
worth buying,” SEB AB,  Sweden ’s third-largest bank, said today
in an e-mailed report. The bank cited a glut of 10 to 13
terawatt-hours in hydropower supplies and high nuclear
utilization rates. The Nordic area gets about a fifth of its
power from 14 nuclear reactors, and more than by running  water
through turbines , which means that prices are affected by
rainfall and reactor generating rates.  Electricity for December delivery fell 1.2 percent to 38.85
euros a megawatt-hour, and later traded at 38.70 euros.  Temperatures in  Stockholm  may rise to 7 degrees Celsius (43
degrees Fahrenheit) in the coming 10 days, compared with 1
degree tomorrow, according to the  Swedish Meteorological and
Hydrological Institute’s  website.  The nuclear utilization rate from reactors in Sweden and
 Finland  jumped to 95 percentage points today, the highest rate
since Bloomberg started compiling the data in August, according
to calculations based on company websites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
