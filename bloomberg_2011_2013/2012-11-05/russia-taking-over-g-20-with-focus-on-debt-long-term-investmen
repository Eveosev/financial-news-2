Russia  will use its term as president
of the Group of 20 to make recommendations on how to manage
sovereign debt and help countries identify funding for long-term
investment, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said.  Siluanov outlined Russia’s goals over the next year at the
close of a two-day meeting of finance ministers from G-20
nations in Mexico City.  “Economic growth is on everyone’s agenda but no one has
studied those questions in detail,” Siluanov told reporters.
“Today, there are global resources such as pension and
insurance funds that could be transformed to fund infrastructure
investments.”  Russia will host its first meeting of finance officials
from G-20 nations Feb. 15-16, in Moscow, Siluanov said.  Siluanov said he hopes to reach an agreement on how to
overhaul the International Monetary Fund’s quota system to give
 emerging markets  more say in how the multilateral lender is run
by the time leaders from G-20 nations gather in September, in
 St. Petersburg .  To contact the reporter on this story:
