Egypt  will issue a public tender for
the export of 100,000 tonnes of rice by mid-November, the second
since the country lifted a four-year ban on exporting locally
grown rice last month, the head of the Agriculture Export
Council said.  Egypt aims to export half a million tonnes of rice by the
end of the current export season, Ali Helmy Eissa said by phone
from Cairo today. The Trade and Industry Ministry will allow
each supplier to export no more than 11,000 tons, Eissa said.  Rice shipments were allowed to resume on Oct. 1 following a
ban set in March 2008. The first rice tender was issued on
Oct.15, Eissa said.  Egypt’s rice production in 2012 is expected to increase by
4 percent to 5.9 million tons compared with 5.67 million tons
last year, according to data on the United Nations Food &
Agriculture Organization’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
