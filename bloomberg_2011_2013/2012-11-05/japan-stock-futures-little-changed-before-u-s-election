Japanese  stock futures  and Australian
equities were little changed ahead of a presidential election in
the U.S. and before the  Reserve Bank  of Australia releases its
interest-rate decision.  American Depositary Receipts  of Toyota Motor Corp. gained
1.7 percent as Japan’s largest manufacturer raised its profit
forecast. Shares of NTN Corp., a bearing maker, may be active in
Tokyo after it forecast a loss, reversing its previous estimate
for a full-year profit.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ) , Australia’s third-largest bank by market value, advanced
0.4 percent before the RBA statement.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in

in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,000 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was
little changed today and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.4
percent in Wellington.  “Market participants are struggling to pick a direction
ahead of the U.S. presidential elections,” said Stan Shamu,
market strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne. “Whatever the
outcome of today’s rate decision in Australia, the statement
will probably carry more weight.”  Interest-rate swaps data compiled by Bloomberg indicate
traders see a 53 percent chance RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  will
lower the overnight cash rate target by 25 basis points today.

quarter-percentage point reduction. The decision is due at 2:30
p.m. Sydney time.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1

& Poor’s 500 Index and 12.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
