The  South Stream  pipeline project,
whose stakeholders are  Gazprom OAO (GAZP) , Italy’s  ENI SpA (ENI) , Germany’s
Wintershall AG and  Electricite de France SA , will bypass
 Croatia ,  Poslovni Dnevnik  reported, citing  Alexander Medvedev ,
Gazprom’s deputy Chief Executive Officer.  A planned offshoot to Croatia was canceled, with the route
going from Serbia directly to Hungary at the town of Subotica,
according to Poslovni.  The 470-kilometer pipeline is designed to ship as much as
63 billion cubic meters of Russian gas across the  Black Sea  to
southeastern and central Europe, without going through Ukraine.
It’s a rival to the Nabucco project that plans to ship Caspian
gas via Turkey.  Plinacro d.o.o. , Croatia’s state-owned pipeline operator,
which has been in talks with Gazprom over the pipeline’s route
through Croatia, said in a statement over the weekend it hasn’t
been notified of Gazprom’s decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
