Turkey  has started an investigation
into the reported discovery of hand guns in biscuit boxes sent
by a Turkish firm to Yemen, Anatolia news agency said today,
citing Customs and Trade Minister Hayati Yazici.  The investigation began after Yemenâ€™s foreign ministry
notified Turkey about the discovery, Anatolia said. Yazici did
not say how many guns were discovered, Anatolia said.  The boxes were loaded on a ship at the Mediterranean
customs point of Mersin, the agency said. Yazici said the
carrier was also a Turkish firm. He did not give names of the
exporter and carrier companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
