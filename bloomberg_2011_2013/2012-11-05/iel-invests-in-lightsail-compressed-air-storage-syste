LightSail Energy Inc., a closely held
developer of energy-storage systems, received $37.3 million in
funding led by billionaire investor Peter Thiel to commercialize
its technology.  The Series D financing included  Khosla Ventures , which led
LightSail’s prior funding rounds, and billionaire Bill Gates,
the Berkeley, California-based company said today in a
statement.  LightSail is developing systems that compress air in tanks
and generate electricity when the air is released. Renewable
sources of energy such as wind and sunlight can’t provide power
all the time, and the industry is seeking cost-effective methods
to store power for use after sundown or when the wind isn’t
blowing.  The company’s storage  technology  may “make renewable
energy practical and mainstream for the first time,” Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, said in the statement.  Other companies are developing similar systems, including
SustainX Inc. and General Compression Inc. Innovacorp also
participated in the funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
