The U.K. and  Taiwan  agreed to work
together to develop clean power technology including smart grids
as part of a visit by British officials to the island in  Asia .  Cornwall, the U.K.’s most south-westerly region will work
with authorities in Penghu, an archipelago off the western coast
of Taiwan, to develop the technology, according to a  statement 
today from the British Trade and Cultural Office in Taiwan.  Cornwall and Penghu plan to use smart grids to improve
efficiency and cope with added demands from inflows of tourists.
The technology works by gathering information from meters on how
power is used to improve efficiency and manage peaks in demand.  Today’s accord includes development of power distribution
networks,  renewable energy  technologies and energy storage,
according to the statement. Britain is seeking to install smart
meters in 53 million homes by the end of 2020. Ernst & Young
 estimates  goods and services resulting from smart grids may add
13 billion pounds ($21 billion) to the U.K. economy by 2050.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
