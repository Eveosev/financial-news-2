CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched
TV network, reached an agreement to supply its catalog of reruns
to Hulu’s paid online video service, opening a new revenue
source for the broadcaster.  CBS shows including “Medium” and “Numb3rs” will begin
appearing on Hulu Plus in January, the companies said today in a
statement. Financial terms of the non-exclusive agreement
weren’t disclosed.  With CBS, Hulu will have access to programming from the
four biggest U.S. broadcast TV networks. The Los Angeles-based
website, owned by  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC,  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC and
News Corp.’s Fox, also will rotate a selection of CBS shows on
its free, advertising-supported service, the companies said.  Hulu already receives CBS-owned programs produced for The
CW and for its online subscription service in Japan.  CBS, controlled by  Sumner Redstone , gained 2.4 percent to
$34.01 at the close in New York. The stock has climbed 25
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
