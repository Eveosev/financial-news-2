Andy Murray started the season-ending
ATP World Tour Finals in  London  for the best eight tennis
players in the world with a win against Tomas Berdych.    Competing in his first singles match on home soil since he
won the gold medal at the London Olympics, Murray beat the
former Wimbledon finalist from the Czech Republic, 3-6, 6-3,
6-4.   The third-ranked Murray received a huge cheer from the
crowd at London’s O2 arena as he walked onto court. The 25-year-
old right-hander from Dunblane,  Scotland  is having a
breakthrough season. After clinching Olympic gold, he went on to
win his first major title at the U.S. Open in September. His
victory in New York, after four defeats in Grand Slam finals,
ended Britain’s 76-year long wait for a male British major
singles champion.   The ATP Finals feature a round-robin format. The top eight
players on the ATP World Tour rankings are divided into two
groups of four, with the top two in each section moving into the
knockout semifinals.  Novak Djokovic of  Serbia , who will end the season as the
world’s top-ranked player for the second straight year, was
drawn in the same group as Murray and will play  France ’s Jo-
Wilfried Tsonga in the evening session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
