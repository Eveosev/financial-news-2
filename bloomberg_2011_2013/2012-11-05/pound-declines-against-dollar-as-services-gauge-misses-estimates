The pound fell for a second day
against the dollar after a report showed an index of services
increased less than analysts estimated last month.  The U.K currency declined 0.2 percent to $1.5984 at 9:39
a.m.  London  time. It traded little changed at 80.09 pence per
euro, after reaching 79.86 pence earlier today, the strongest
level in five weeks.  U.K. 10-year government bonds advanced, with the yield
declining three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.83
percent.  A gauge of companies from banks to airlines fell to 50.6
from 52.2 in September, Markit Economics and the  Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said in London today.
Economists had forecast a reading of 52.0, according to the
median of 30 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
