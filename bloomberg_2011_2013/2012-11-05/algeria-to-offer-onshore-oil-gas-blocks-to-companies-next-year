Algeria , holder of  Africa ’s fourth-
largest crude reserves, plans to invite bids from international
energy companies for oil and gas blocks in the first two months
of next year.  The bidding round will take place under the terms of a
proposed hydrocarbons law that is to be ratified before the end
of the year, Khelil Ouahmed, director of gas affairs at the
state hydrocarbons regulator Alnaft, said today in an interview
in Algiers. The nation awarded two out of 10 permits offered in
a previous round in March 2011.  “The last bid did not yield good results,” Ouahmed said.
“So we spoke to the foreign companies and they said there were
technical and economic problems as well as problems related to
rights.”  The new law helps guarantee the profitability of
investments and links taxes to the size of the discovery, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
