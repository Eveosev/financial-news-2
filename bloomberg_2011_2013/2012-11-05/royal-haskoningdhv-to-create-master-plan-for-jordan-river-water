Royal HaskoningDHV, a project
management and engineering consultant, has been awarded a
contract to develop a cross-border plan for the Lower Jordan,
the historic river between the Sea of Galilee and  Dead Sea .  The master plan is to integrate Israeli, Palestinian and
Jordanian versions to distribute water more fairly, improve the
ecosystem and provide more open public access to the river, a
World Heritage List nominee, the company said.  No terms were given by the Friends of the Earth Middle East
group that awarded the contract to Royal HaskoningDHV together
with the Stockholm International Water Institute and the Global
Nature Fund. The plan is to be readied by 2014, said the Dutch
company, whose project range includes water scarcity issues,
sustainable infrastructure and energy resources.  Most of the water from the Lower Jordan is drained off now
for agriculture and water supplies. The river is “seriously
polluted due to the discharge of effluent and other
contaminants,” Royal HaskoningDHV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
