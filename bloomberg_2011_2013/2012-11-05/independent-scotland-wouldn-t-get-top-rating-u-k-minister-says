An independent Scotland would
probably be denied the top credit rating afforded to Britain,
said U.K. Scottish Secretary  Michael Moore .  Scotland would have to “start from scratch” to win the
confidence of ratings companies and investors and wouldn’t be
able to borrow at the same rate as the U.K. does now, Moore told
business leaders in Edinburgh today.  “Let us be clear about the facts of separation,” Moore
said. “An independent Scotland would not inherit the U.K.’s
strong credit rating -- a rating we’ve managed to keep hold of
when our European neighbors have not.”  Prime Minister David Cameron signed an accord last month
with Scottish First Minister  Alex Salmond  on the terms of an
independence referendum by the end of 2014, setting the stage
for two years of debate on splitting up the U.K. Ratings
companies have indicated an independent  Scotland  could not count
on receiving a top credit score.  To contact the reporter on this story:
