Vietnam  faces “high risks” that
inflation will accelerate toward the end of the year as the
government strives to spur lending and help businesses,
according to a central bank official.  “The central bank will manage its monetary policies in a
manner that can bring down lending interest rates to help
businesses,” Do Thi Nhung, deputy head of the monetary policy
department at the central bank, told a conference in Hanoi
today.  Vietnam’s bank lending has stagnated as companies contend
with growing inventories and decreased demand. The  economy  needs
to expand 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter in order to meet the
government’s full-year growth target of 5.2 percent, Prime
Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said last month.  The country’s  inflation  quickened to 7 percent in October
from 6.48 percent in September. Consumer prices gained 0.85
percent from the previous month.  The central bank “should be very cautious of seasonal
inflation” toward year-end in its policy management, Le Xuan
Nghia, a member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy
Advisory Council, said at the same conference.  The central bank is also working with the ministries of
trade, agriculture and construction to help companies reduce
unsold inventories as part of measures to resolve bad debts at
banks, Nhung said.  Liquidity at Vietnam banks now is at a surplus and the
money market has “stabilized,” Nhung said. Still, banks face
difficulties in raising long-term funds, she said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
