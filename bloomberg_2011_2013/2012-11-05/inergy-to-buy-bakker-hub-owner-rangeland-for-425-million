Inergy Midstream LP (NRGM)  agreed to buy
closely held Rangeland Energy LLC for $425 million in cash,
giving the partnership access to  North Dakota ’s fast-growing
Bakken field.  Rangeland owns the Colt Hub, a delivery point for crude
from the Bakken Shale with the capacity to handle 190,000
barrels a day, according to a statement today. It’s the first
major crude project and the largest purchase ever for Kansas
City, Missouri-based Inergy, which owns natural gas and natural
gas liquids storage and transportation in the U.S. and Canada,
according to its website.  Unlike other hubs in the area, which are owned by
producers, Colt takes oil from all companies, said Bill Waldrip,
managing director for private-equity firm EnCap Flatrock
Midstream, which backed  Sugar Land , Texas-based Rangeland.
“It’s kind of a different concept.”  North Dakota’s oil production grew to 701,000 barrels a day
in August, from less than 100,000 in 2005, according to the
North Dakota Industrial Commission. Oil from the field trades at
a discount, in part because there aren’t enough ways to bring
the crude to refiners.  Rangeland’s hub, which opened in May in Williams County,
North Dakota, transfers oil onto trains as much as 120 cars long
for shipment. The system also includes a 21-mile (34-kilometer)
pipeline that connects to systems owned by  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  and
 Tesoro Corp. (TSO)   Purchase Funding  Inergy will fund the purchase by selling $225 million of
common units in a private placement and from unsecured debt
financing.  Rangeland, formed in 2009, developed the idea for the
terminal and built it quickly, allowing EnCap Flatrock to make a
fast return on its investment, Waldrip said. He declined to give
the size of EnCap Flatrock’s original investment.  Citigroup Inc. advised Rangeland on the sale, expected to
close in December.  Jones Day  provided legal advice. Jefferies
Group Inc. advised Inergy.  Inergy  rose  4.6 percent to $23.76 at 1:39 p.m. in New York.
The partnership has gained 25 percent this year.  Inergy LP (NRGY) ,
which owns 74 percent of Inergy Midstream, rose 4.9 percent to
$19.97. The companies were the top performers on the 82-member
 Tortoise MLP Index (TMLP)  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
