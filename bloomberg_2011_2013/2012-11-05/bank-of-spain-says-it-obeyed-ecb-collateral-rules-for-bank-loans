The Bank of  Spain  said it has
correctly applied the  European Central Bank ’s collateral rules
when assessing the quality of assets pledged by Spanish lenders
in return for ECB loans.  The discount on Spanish debt pledged as collateral is based
on the credit rating of DBRS Inc., said a Bank of Spain
spokesman, who asked not to be named in line with the central
policy. German newspaper Die Welt reported yesterday that
Spanish treasury bills used as collateral in refinancing
operations only partially fulfilled ECB requirements and banks
received as much as 16.6 billion euros ($21.3 billion) of loans
they shouldn’t have if quality rules had been strictly followed.  The ECB is investigating the matter, a spokesman said.  Toronto-based DBRS rates debt issued by the Spanish
government at ‘A Low,’ its seventh-highest investment-grade
rating. That’s two steps higher than  Fitch Ratings  and three
steps higher than Moody’s Investors Service and Standard &
Poor’s. The ECB takes smaller haircuts on securities with an A-
rating, according to the central bank’s website.  The Bank of Spain yesterday applied a valuation of 95.067
percent to 2 billion euros of Spanish treasury bills due 2014,
according to the Madrid-based central bank’s  website . That is
lower than the 96.66 percent closing price of the securities,
according to Bloomberg prices.  The ECB applies a 1.5 percent haircut to zero-coupon
government debt with a residual maturity between one or three
years and a rating better than A minus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
