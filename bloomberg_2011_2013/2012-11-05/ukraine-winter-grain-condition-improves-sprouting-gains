The condition of Ukraine’s winter
grains improved as more plants sprouted, according to researcher
UkrAgroConsult.  Sprouting increased to 6.82 million hectares (16.8 million
acres), or almost 89 percent of the planted area, as of Nov. 1,
from 6.47 million hectares a week earlier, the Kiev-based
researcher said today in e-mailed statement.  Almost 56 percent of emerged winter grains were in good
condition by Nov. 1, compared with 54 percent as of
Oct. 25, according to the statement. The share of weak crops
declined to 8.9 percent from 9.7 percent. Most of Ukraine’s
winter grain is wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
