Telstra Corp. (TLS) , Australia’s biggest
phone company, is planning its first benchmark-sized bond sale
in its home market since 2005.  Telstra hired Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd. and
Westpac Banking Corp. to manage the offering, according to an e-
mailed statement from National Australia Bank today. The
Melbourne-based phone company may offer five-year notes yielding
about 100 basis points more than swap rates, said a person
familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named as the terms
aren’t set.  Telstra sold A$500 million ($518 million) of November 2013
securities in 2005, in its last domestic sale of that size or
more, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Corporate bond
issuance in Australia has accelerated after  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) 
priced A$1 billion of notes on Oct. 9 in the first Australian
dollar-denominated sale from the world’s biggest miner in more
than a decade, and the largest line of notes ever sold in the
nation by a company outside the financial industry, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Telstra, rated A by  Standard & Poor’s , its sixth-highest
investment grade, has A$12.7 billion of bonds outstanding in
eight currencies, the  data  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
