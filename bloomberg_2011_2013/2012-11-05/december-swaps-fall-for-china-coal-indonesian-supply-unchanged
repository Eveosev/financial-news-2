Swaps dropped for thermal coal
delivered to South  China , according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore
Pte.  The contract for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South China in the first
quarter of 2013 fell 25 cents to $84 a metric ton on a net-as-
received basis on Nov. 2, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The
swap for December slid 5 cents to $83.80 a ton.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram for loading in
the first quarter next year of 2013 was unchanged at $60.50 a
ton on a net-as-received basis, the energy broker said. The
December contract held at $60.10 a ton.  The price of benchmark power-station coal with energy value
of 5,500 kilocalories per kilogram at Qinhuangdao port remained
unchanged at 635 ($102) to 645  yuan  a ton as of yesterday
compared with week earlier, data today from China Coal Transport
and Distribution Association show. Stockpiles at Qinhuangdao
were little changed at 5.48 million metric tons, down 22,000
tons from a week ago.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of  Indonesia â€™s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with better quality stock.
Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100 per kilogram,
according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
