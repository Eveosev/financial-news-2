  China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) ’s
third-quarter profit rose 30 percent as the nation’s biggest
wind-power producer sold more electricity from the clean source.  Net income rose to 260 million  yuan  ($41.6 million) in the
three months ended Sept. 30 from 200 million yuan a year
earlier, according to calculations based on nine-month results
released today through the Hong Kong stock exchange. Sales from
the wind-power business rose 43 percent to 1.7 billion yuan.  Longyuan reported a profit even as competitors struggled
with  China ’s tightening of the approval process for wind farms
in order to match the amount of electricity from renewables to
the grid’s capacity to handle the influx of power. China is
expected to install 18.6 gigawatts of wind farms this year, 7
percent less than 2011, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance.  China Datang Corp. Renewable Power Co. (1798) , a wind-farm
developer, on Oct. 30 posted a loss of 8.56 million yuan in the
first nine months.  Wind-power generation rose 23 percent to 11.8 billion
kilowatt-hours in the first nine months of the year, Beijing-
based Longyuan said. Electricity from other renewable power
projects more than tripled to 452 million kilowatt-hours, while
coal power generation and sales fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
