India ’s government may consider
borrowing an extra 250 billion rupees ($4.6 billion) after
setting a higher budget deficit target for the year ending March
31, said two Finance Ministry officials with direct knowledge of
the matter.  The ministry will decide by the end of January or early
February if it will raise the additional amount by selling
 government securities  or treasury bills, the two people said,
asking not to be identified as they aren’t authorized to speak
on the subject. Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram has
vowed to cap the deficit at 5.3 percent of gross domestic
product for the 12 months through March, versus an earlier
target of 5.1 percent proposed by his predecessor.  India plans to raise 2 trillion rupees in the second half
of the fiscal year, Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram
told reporters in  New Delhi  on Sept. 27, leaving the target
unchanged for the whole year at 5.69 trillion rupees.  The nation’s  budget deficit  is the widest among major
emerging economies as slower growth hurts tax receipts and
subsidies fan spending, imperiling the government’s goal of
narrowing the gap from 5.8 percent last year. Officials boosted
diesel prices on Sept. 14 to restrain expenditure on
compensation for below-cost sales.  Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings reduced the outlook on
India’s credit rating to negative from stable earlier this year,
bringing the nation a step closer to junk status, citing fiscal
and current-account imbalances.  Trimming Subsidy  The benchmark 8.15 percent note due June 2022 reversed
earlier gains, with the yield touching 8.21 percent versus the
day’s low of 8.18 percent, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The rate was little changed from Nov. 2 at 8.20
percent as of 3:27 p.m. in Mumbai.  The 10-year  yield  has declined 34 basis points since the
end of March. The rupee has weakened almost 7 percent in the
same period,  Asia ’s worst, and was at 54.565 a dollar.  Sovereign-debt issuance will exceed the target for the year
ending March 31 by 500 billion rupees, according to the median
of eight estimates compiled by Bloomberg in September.  The Department of Economic Affairs estimates the revenue
shortfall for the year ending March 31 at 200 billion rupees,
while the revenue department says it could be 600 billion
rupees, Bloomberg TV India reported today, citing people it
didn’t identify.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  is trying to trim a subsidy
bill for food, fuel and fertilizer by 12 percent to 1.9 trillion
rupees in the year through March 2013. The government also aims
to raise 300 billion rupees from share sales by state companies.  The disinvestment program and a push to step up tax
collection will be the key to meeting the goal of 5.3 percent of
GDP, the two people said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
