Brazil’s real fell to a three-week
low on speculation the central bank will sustain its policy of
intervention to support exporters by weakening the currency.  The real also declined along with most emerging-market
currencies as concern  Greece  will struggle to win further aid
and tomorrow’s U.S. presidential election damped demand for
emerging-market assets. Brazil swap rates decreased after
economists reduced their estimates for borrowing costs at the
end of next year.  “The markets abroad have a tendency of poor performance
today, with investors pulling back on any doubts,” Ures Folchini, the head of fixed income at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA,
said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. “And the central bank
has had success keeping the real weak, not letting it strengthen
beyond 2 per dollar.”  The real depreciated 0.2 percent to 2.0352 per dollar, the
lowest level on a closing basis since Oct. 15. Swap rates on
contracts due in January 2014 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to a record low 7.32 percent.  To weaken the real and protect exporters,  Brazil ’s central
bank sold $1.4 billion of reverse currency swaps contracts on
Oct. 25, $1.6 billion on Oct. 23, $1.3 billion on Oct. 5, $5.7
billion Sept. 12 through Sept. 17 and $350 million on Aug. 21.
The August reverse swaps were the first since March.  Swap rates dropped after analysts in a central bank survey
cut their forecasts for Brazil’s borrowing costs at the end of
2013. Brazil’s target lending  rate , known as the Selic, will be
7.63 percent at the end of next year, according to the median
estimate in a central bank survey of about 100 analysts
published today. Analysts had forecast 7.75 percent in the
previous week and 8 percent the week before that.  Rate Cuts  “The outlook fell in the central bank survey as the
tendency is for the market to reduce its bets on rate increases
in 2013,” Folchini said.  Brazil cut the target lending rate for a 10th straight
meeting on Oct. 10 to a record low 7.25 percent, down from 12.5
percent in August 2011, to revive the slowest growth among major
emerging-market economies.  Keeping  interest rates  stable for a “sufficiently
prolonged” period is the best strategy to ensure inflation
converges to the central bank’s target range of 4.5 percent,
plus or minus 2 percentage points, the monetary authority said
in the minutes of its Oct. 9-10 meeting.  The central bank will hold the rate steady until July, when
it will begin raising borrowing costs with an increase of 25
basis points, trading in swap rates shows.  Growth Outlook  Economists in the central bank survey maintained their
forecasts of 1.54 percent gross domestic product growth this
year and 4 percent expansion in 2013. Inflation this year will
be 5.44 percent, the analysts said, down from the previous
week’s estimate of 5.45 percent. The economists held their
inflation forecast for next year at 5.40 percent.  Brazil’s industrial output in September fell 1 percent from
August, the first decline in four months. Consumer default rates
in September matched the highest level since November 2009 as
indebted consumers struggle to keep up with payments.  Carlos Hamilton, the central bank’s economic policy
director, said in September that inflation is unlikely to
converge to the midpoint of the bank’s target range until the
third quarter of 2013.  The October FIPE consumer prices index from the Foundation
Economics Research Institute in  Sao Paulo  rose 0.8 percent from
the month before, compared with an increase of 0.55 percent in
September. The median forecast of 19 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg was for an increase of 0.81 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
