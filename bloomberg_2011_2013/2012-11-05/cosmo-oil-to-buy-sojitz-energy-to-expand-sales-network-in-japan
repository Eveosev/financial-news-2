Cosmo Oil Co., a Japanese refiner
partly owned by the government of  Abu Dhabi , agreed to buy the
petroleum-product sales unit of  Sojitz (2768)  Corp. for an undisclosed
amount to expand its domestic sales network.  The refiner will increase its stake in Sojitz Energy Corp.
to 97.23 percent from 0.15 percent by the end of January, the
Tokyo-based company said in a statement. Cosmo is assessing the
impact of the acquisition on earnings, according to the
statement.  The acquisition will help Cosmo achieve economies of scale
in supply and logistics and give it access to Sojitz Energyâ€™s
customers. Cosmo plans to buy the stake from shareholders
including  JX Holdings Inc. (5020)  and  Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. (5002) , Director
and Senior Executive Officer Hisahi Kobayashi told reporters in
 Tokyo  today. He declined to comment on how much the refiner will
pay for the stake.  Cosmo posted a first-half loss of 79 billion yen ($983
million) on the extended shutdown of its Chiba refinery. Sojitz
Energy, which operates 47 gas stations and distributes products
to 158 wholesalers, had a net income of 53 million yen in the
year ended March 2012, Sojitz said in a May 8 statement. That
compares with a 155 million-yen loss a year earlier, according
to the Japanese trading company.  Cosmo Oil rose 0.7 percent to 148 yen at the close in Tokyo
today, while Sojitz declined 1.9 percent to 101 yen. The
benchmark Nikkei-225 Stock Average fell 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
