The U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has ordered a 90-day moratorium on
foreclosures for homeowners with federally insured mortgages in
four states recovering from superstorm Sandy.  The agency is also allowing officials in Rhode Island,
 Connecticut , New York, and New Jersey to re-allocate federal
housing funds toward services for survivors of the disaster.  “Families who may have been forced from their homes need
to know that help is available to begin the rebuilding
process,” said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, who visited storm
victims who live in public housing in New York over the weekend.  Through the Federal Housing Administration, an arm of HUD,
residents of the four states also can obtain as much as 100
percent financing to rebuild their houses or purchase new homes.  The agency is also gathering information on housing
providers who may have units available to shelter displaced
families, Donovan said in a written statement.  As many as 10,000 residents of New York City will need
housing, the city’s mayor, Michael Bloomberg said yesterday.
Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP, yesterday appointed former Federal
Emergency Management Agency official Brad Gair to head the
city’s housing recovery effort.  “Whether it’s foreclosure relief for families with FHA-
insured loans or helping these counties to recover, HUD stands
ready to help,” Donovan said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
