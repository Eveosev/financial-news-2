Tankers able to haul 250,000 barrels
of oil products will be used to transport cargoes to New York
Harbor from the U.S. Gulf Coast after the waiver of a rule on
Nov. 2, according to  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   The Department of  Homeland Security  said Nov. 2 it waived
part of a requirement within the Jones Act, allowing non-U.S.
vessels to haul fuel between the nation’s ports until Nov. 13.
Costs for tankers shipping gasoline will vary between $2.30 and
$2.50 a barrel depending on vessel age,  Hussein Allidina , Morgan
Stanley’s New York-based head of commodities research, said in
an e-mailed report today.  Prices of reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate
blending, or RBOB, in New York Harbor after the close of
business on Nov. 2 were at a premium of almost $5.50 a barrel to
those on the Gulf Coast, “incentivizing cargoes to flow
north,” Morgan Stanley said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
