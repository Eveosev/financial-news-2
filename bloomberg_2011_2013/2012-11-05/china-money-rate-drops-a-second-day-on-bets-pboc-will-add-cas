China ’s benchmark money-market rate
declined for a second day on speculation the central bank will
add more funds to the financial system using reverse-repurchase
contracts to support the economy.  The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for seven-, 14-and
28-day reverse-repo contracts this week, according to a trader
required to bid at the auctions. The PBOC  injected  a net 379
billion  yuan  ($61 billion) last week, the most in data compiled
by Bloomberg that goes back to 2008.  China’s economy  is likely
to maintain stable, relatively fast growth, the monetary
authority said in a report on its website on Nov. 2.  “The central bank will definitely keep pumping capital
through reverse repos,” said Peng Hao, a bond analyst at Fudian
Bank Co. in Kunming. “Reverse-repo operations are a more
flexible tool than reserve-ratio cuts.”  The seven-day  repurchase  rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped four basis points to 3.33 percent
as of 4:41 p.m. in Shanghai, according to a weighted average
rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, dropped two basis
points to 3.21 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bonds due August
2017 rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.21
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
