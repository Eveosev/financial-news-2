Rede Energia SA (REDE4) ,  Brazil ’s second-best
performing electric utility in 2012, jumped after concluding the
sale of its bankrupt  Centrais Eletricas do Para SA  subsidiary,
known as Celpa, to  Equatorial Energia SA. (EQTL3)   Rede rose 10 percent to 4.86 reais at 12:32 p.m. in Sao
Paulo. Equatorial gained 1.3 percent to 19 reais while the
benchmark Bovespa index fell 0.8 percent.  Equatorial paid 1 real (49 cents) for 39.18 million Celpa
shares, which represent 65.18 percent of the company’s voting
capital, Rede said in a statement after the close of trading
Nov. 1. Celpa filed for  bankruptcy protection  Feb. 28 after a
four-year freeze on rates pushed up debt to 2.3 billion reais.  Equatorial, an electricity holding company owned by
Brazilian private-equity firm Vinci Partners Investimentos
Ltda., agreed in June to take control of the bankrupt utility,
based in Belem, as it seeks to expand in the Amazon region,
where Celpa is the largest power distributor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
