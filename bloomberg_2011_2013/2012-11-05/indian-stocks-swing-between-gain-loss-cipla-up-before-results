Most Indian stocks dropped after the
rupee declined the most in four weeks ahead of tomorrow’s U.S.
presidential election.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, ended little
changed at 18,762.87 at the close, with 17 of 30 stocks on the
measure declining.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the software exporter that  got 
64 percent of its revenue from North America in the year ended
March, fell for the first time in six days. Aluminum producer
 Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , which will report earnings tomorrow,
lost 2.7 percent as metal prices dropped in  London .  U.S. voters will decide tomorrow between giving President
 Barack Obama  another four years in office or changing course
with Republican challenger  Mitt Romney . Obama is leading Romney
by 3 points, according to an Oct. 31-Nov. 3 Pew Research Center
survey. India’s rupee lost 1.5 percent to 54.6075 per dollar,
the most since Oct. 8, likely increasing the import bill and
fueling inflation.  “There’s some caution as the U.S. election is one of the
big global events,” Kaushik Dani, a fund manager at Peerless
Mutual Fund, which has $886 million in assets, said by phone.
“Indian markets would need fresh triggers to scale higher.”  The Sensex advanced 1 percent on Nov. 2, the steepest gain
in six weeks, sending valuations to a 30 percent premium versus
emerging-market peers. The gauge trades at 15 times  estimated
earnings , compared with a multiple of 11.4 times for the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the gauge was at 10.66, near the
year’s lowest level of 10.04 reached on Sept. 11, the data show.  Dollar-Rupee  India’s rupee was the third-worst performer among 25
emerging-market currencies monitored by Bloomberg after the
central bank cut its growth forecast last week. The new U.S.
president will face unprecedented levels of debt and more than
$600 billion in federal spending cuts and tax increases
scheduled to take effect in January.  “If Obama wins, there is a likelihood of the dollar
weakening, while a Romney victory would probably be bad for
emerging-market currencies,” said Vikas Babu, a trader at
state-run Andhra Bank in Mumbai. “We are going to have a
volatile week.”  The Sensex has increased 21 percent this year, driven by
overseas fund purchases and government policy reforms announced
since mid-September to revive economic growth. Foreigners have
bought a net $18.3 billion of local shares this year, the most
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding  China .  No-Confidence Vote  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh started the biggest policy
overhaul in a decade on Sept. 13, including fuel-subsidy curbs
and a push to spur investment in domestic industries. Singh and
the Congress party’s top leadership presented a united front for
the reforms at a weekend gathering of tens of thousands of
supporters. Opposition parties are threatening a no-confidence
vote at the next session of parliament due to begin on Nov. 22.  Hindalco lost 2.7 percent to 114.5 rupees, its steepest
decline since Oct. 8. Copper reached a two-month low in London,
leading a drop among other metals.  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP) 
dropped 2.2 percent to 380.35 rupees and  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) 
retreated 1.2 percent to 397.65 rupees.  Drugmaker  Cipla Ltd. (CIPLA)  reported its highest quarterly profit
in at least 13 years. Net income surged 62 percent to 5 billion
rupees for the September quarter, exceeding the 3.69-billion
rupee median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The
stock advanced 0.9 percent to 380.2 rupees in a fourth day of
gains before the results, which were announced after markets
closed. Rival  Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. (DRRD)  jumped 1.3 percent
to 1,797.60 rupees, the highest level since April 19.  Out of the 20 Sensex companies that have reported earnings
for the quarter ended September, just three have lagged behind
analysts’ estimates. That compares with 40 percent of the index
companies missing forecasts in the June quarter, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The S&P  CNX Nifty Index (NIFTY)  rose 0.1 percent to 5,704.2. Its
November futures settled at 5,739.65. India VIX, which gauges
the cost of protection against losses in the Nifty, jumped 7.1
percent to 14.63. The National Stock Exchange of India and the
BSE Ltd.  traded  868 million shares on Nov. 2, compared with a
12-month daily average of 912 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
