Radian Group Inc. (RDN)  declined in New
York trading after Barron’s said the mortgage insurer may
eventually incur costs for claims that it denied.  Radian dropped 51 cents, or 9.5 percent, to $4.87 at 9:51
a.m. in New York. The Philadelphia-based company has more than
doubled this year as Chief Executive Officer S.A. Ibrahim
purchased reinsurance and booked investment gains that helped
meet regulators’ capital standards. That compares with a 50
percent decline at  MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , which breached
regulatory limits.  Radian may be more aggressive than Milwaukee-based MGIC in
refusing to pay claims, sometimes citing missing paperwork, the
weekly publication said Nov. 3. Mortgage insurers agree to cover
losses when homeowners default and foreclosures fail to recoup
costs. The benefit from turning down claims may be short lived,
according to Barron’s, which said Radian’s mortgage unit also
benefits from ties with a bond insurer.  “Radian is propping up its  balance sheet  by rejecting
claims and effectively double-pledging assets,” Barron’s said.
“When these short-term fixes run out, the shares could
tumble.”  A spokeswoman for the insurer said one reason Radian has a
higher rejection rate than rivals is its policy to wait until
claims are received before saying it won’t pay, according to
Barron’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
