U.K. prosecutors dropped a three-year
investigation into collapsed investment firm Keydata Investments
Services Ltd. after failing to track down more than 100 million
pounds ($160 million) in missing funds.  The Serious Fraud Office said efforts to trace the secure
income bonds “have not met with any success and it is
considered unlikely that the situation will change,” the agency
said in a Nov. 2 posting on its website.  The SFO said in May 2011 it didn’t have enough evidence to
make prosecutions and planned to focus on tracing assets.
Keydata had 2.8 billion pounds of assets under management when
the Financial Services Authority forced it into administration
in 2009 and referred the case to the SFO. Keydata used
investors’ money to buy bonds issued by  Luxembourg  based SLS
Capital SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
