Quebec  Finance Minister Nicolas Marceau will present a budget Nov. 20, months ahead of the
fiscal year starting in April, to lay out plans to eliminate the
deficit.  “Waiting until spring of 2013 would only delay the
identification and implementation of actions that are necessary
to put Quebec back on track for a balanced budget next year,”
Marceau said in a  statement  from the provincial capital of
 Quebec City  today.  The separatist Parti Quebecois won the Sept. 4 election to
return to power for the first time in nine years, and needs
opposition support to pass a budget because it failed to win a
majority of seats in the legislature. Marceau said Oct. 5 that
the deficit this year will probably exceed a prior forecast of
C$1.5 billion ($1.5 billion) because of a decision to close a
nuclear power plant, reducing the dividend paid out to the
government by state-owned utility Hydro-Quebec.  Marceau also said that a delay in meeting the balanced
budget time line “would have important consequences for the
finances and the economy of Quebec.”  Quebec’s 4.5 percent bonds due December 2017 rose 2
Canadian cents to C$112.42 today. The yield fell one basis point
to 1.91 percent.  The budget will be released at 4 p.m.  New York  time in
Quebec City, according to the government statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
