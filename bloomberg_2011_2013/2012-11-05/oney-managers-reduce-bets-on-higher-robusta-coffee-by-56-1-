Money managers reduced bets on rising
prices of robusta coffee traded in  London  by 56 percent in the
week ended Oct. 30, according to data from NYSE Liffe, the
derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext.  Net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, fell to 3,876
futures and options, the commitments of traders report published
today on the exchange’s  website  showed. That compares with 8,794
contracts a week earlier. Prices fell 3.6 percent in the period.  “Looking at the weekly chart, London is beginning to look
likely to test lower, which is probably why we have seen some
fund selling,” London-based broker Sucden Financial Ltd. said
in a report e-mailed Nov. 2. “A fund short could eventually be
the catalyst to higher prices.”  In cocoa, net-long positions fell to 42,310 futures and
options from 44,089 contracts a week earlier, the data showed.
Cocoa slid 5.1 percent in the period.  The net-long position in white, or refined, sugar held by
money managers fell to 2,678 futures and options from 4,245
contracts a week earlier, the data showed. The sweetener slipped
3 percent in the period.  Money managers held no position in feed wheat, unchanged
from a week earlier. The grain rose 2.2 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
