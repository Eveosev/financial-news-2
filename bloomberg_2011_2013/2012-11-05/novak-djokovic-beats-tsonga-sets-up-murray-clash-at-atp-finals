Top-ranked Novak Djokovic started his
campaign for a second title at the season-ending ATP World Tour
Finals with a win.  The Serb defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France, 7-6 (7-4),
6-3 in his first group match at London’s O2 arena.  He’ll play U.S. Open winner  Andy Murray  of Britain in his
next group match on Wednesday. Murray, also the reigning Olympic
champion, had earlier in the day opened the event with a three-
set win against Tomas Berdych of the  Czech Republic .  The ATP Finals feature a round-robin format. The top eight
players in the ATP World Tour rankings are divided into two
groups of four, with the top two in each section moving into the
knockout semifinals.  Roger Federer  of Switzerland is defending
champion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
