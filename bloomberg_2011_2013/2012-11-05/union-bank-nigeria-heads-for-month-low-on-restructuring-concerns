Union Bank Nigeria Plc (UBN) , one of eight
lenders bailed out by the central bank three years ago,
retreated as investors waited for the outcome of a
restructuring, according to Vetiva Capital Management Ltd.  The stock fell as much as 6.7 percent to 7.47 naira, its
lowest since Oct. 2, and closed 0.3 percent down at 7.99 naira
in Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital.  Union Global Partners Ltd., a group of Nigerian and
international investors, provided $500 million to complete the
bank’s recapitalization, it said on Oct. 19. The management
team, led by Chief Executive Officer Emeka Emuwa, the former
head of Citibank Nigeria Ltd., took over on Nov. 1.  “Investors are on the sidelines waiting for further
progress,” Abiola Rasaq, a Lagos-based analyst at Vetiva, said
by phone today. “Investors are still cautious as to the
fundamental valuation of Union Bank.”  A debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 resulting from loans to
speculators on the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  and investors in the
oil industry threatened to bring down the banking system. The
central bank fired the heads of eight of the country’s 24
lenders and established the Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria,
or Amcon, to buy bad debts and stabilize the industry.  Union Global now holds 65 percent of Union Bank’s shares,
Amcon 20 percent, and minorities 15 percent.  Union Bank has fallen 25 percent this year compared with a
28 percent increase in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
