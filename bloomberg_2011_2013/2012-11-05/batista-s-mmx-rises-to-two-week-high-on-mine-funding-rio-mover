MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3) , the
iron-ore producer controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike
Batista , rose to a two-week high after financing for its Serra
Azul expansion project received initial approval.  MMX, based in Rio de Janeiro,  climbed  1.7 percent to 4.14
reais at the close in  Sao Paulo  today, the highest since Oct.
23. The stock advanced 5.6 percent in the past three trading
sessions, beating the 0.9 percent increase of the benchmark
Bovespa  index .  The company, which is expanding its  Serra Azul  unit in
Minas Gerais state,  said  today that Brazil’s National
Development Bank, or BNDES, gave initial approval for the
project’s long-term financing. While the loan is still pending
final approval, the announcement is positive for MMX, Barclays
Plc analysts led by Leonardo Correa wrote in a note to clients
today.  “Final terms of the funding arrangement are still unknown,
but this should help mitigate concerns on project execution,”
the analysts said. “We would expect investors’ risk perception
over the project to gradually improve through year-end.”  The project is budgeted at 4.8 billion reais ($2.4
billion), the company said April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
