Somalia ’s Prime Minister Abdi Farah
Shirdon named a 10-member Cabinet that includes Fozia Yusuf Haji
Aden as the Horn of Africa country’s first female foreign
minister.  Aden, who was also appointed deputy prime minister, is one
of two women in the new administration, Shirdon said in a
ceremony at the presidential palace in Mogadishu, the capital,
yesterday. The number of ministers has been reduced from 18 in
the previous transitional administration.  “This is an historic moment for Somalia’s people and
particularly for Somali women,” Aden said.  Somali lawmakers in September elected Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud as president, marking the 16th attempt to establish an
effective central government since the ouster of dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Previous administrations have failed
to stem clan-based fighting, halt piracy off Somalia’s coast and
defeat an insurgency led by the Islamist al-Shabaab militia
since at least 2006.  Parliament is expected to decide on the nominations before
Nov. 17, Mohamed Sheikh Osman Jawari, the speaker of parliament,
said at the ceremony.  The following are the names of the ministers proposed by
