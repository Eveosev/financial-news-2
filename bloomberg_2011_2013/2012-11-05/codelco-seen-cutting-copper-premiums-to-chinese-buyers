Codelco, the world’s largest copper
producer, will probably reduce the premium charged to Chinese
buyers for a second year as increasing domestic production
lowers demand for imports.  The fee may drop to $100 a metric ton in 2013 from $110
this year, according to the median of 11 estimates from
executives, analysts and traders compiled by Bloomberg. The
amount is added to the price of immediate-delivery copper on the
London Metal Exchange to cover costs such as shipping and
insurance. Codelco cut the fee to $85 from $90 for European
clients, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  Imports by  China , the world’s largest user, are set to fall
next year as smelting and refining capacity rises, outpacing
growth in consumption, according to researcher Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its 12-
month forecast for copper by 11 percent to $8,000 per ton from
$9,000 because of slowing Chinese demand, it said Oct. 15.  “There’s no doubt the premium will drop,” said Wang
Yuemin, an analyst at data provider SMM Information & Technology
Co. “Even if demand recovers a bit as expected, we have a huge
inventory, not to speak of new production capacity in the
pipeline.”  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange dropped 2.7 percent in the past year as the slowest
growth in China since 2009 and  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
cut demand. The metal fell 0.7 percent to $7,613.25 at 5:43 p.m.
Shanghai time.  ‘Comfortable’ Buffer  Aurubis AG (NDA) , the second-largest refined producer, cut the
premium for buyers in Europe by $4 to $86 a ton in June. The
Hamburg-based company will keep the fee at that level next year
to support demand, Michaela Hessling, a company spokeswoman,
said on Oct. 8. Pan Pacific Copper Co. in  Tokyo  offered $85 a
ton to Chinese clients in 2013, $15 lower than this year.  China’s consumption of refined copper is forecast by
Antaike to rise to 8.1 million tons in 2013 from 7.68 million
tons this year, while output may increase to 6.1 million tons
from 5.6 million tons. That leaves a deficit of 2 million tons
next year versus 2.08 million tons.  “With a comfortable bonded warehouse inventory buffer, we
think that it will take attractive pricing to result in similar
tonnages being booked,” Barclays Plc said in a report on Oct.
22, referring to Codelco sales. Refined copper  purchases  by
China jumped 50 percent from a year ago to 2.68 million tons in
the first nine months, according to customs data.  Smelters face oversupply with stockpiles in  Shanghai  bonded
warehouses estimated at 600,000 tons to 700,000 tons, according
to Richard Wilson, chairman of metals at Wood Mackenzie. Spot
 premiums  in Shanghai, including insurance and storage costs,
have slumped 65 percent to about $45 from the end of 2011,
according to Metal Bulletin data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
