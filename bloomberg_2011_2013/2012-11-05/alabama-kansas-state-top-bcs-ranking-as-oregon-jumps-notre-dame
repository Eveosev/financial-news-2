The  University of Alabama  and Kansas
State remain the top two teams in college football’s Bowl
Championship Series standings, while the University of Oregon
jumped over fellow unbeaten Notre Dame for the No. 3 ranking.  Alabama  has topped the BCS since the first standings were
released Oct. 14 and moved to 9-0 two days ago by pulling out a
21-17 win against Louisiana State on a 28-yard touchdown pass
with 51 seconds left.  Kansas State also has a 9-0 record after a 44-30 home win
over Oklahoma State, a home victory in which the Wildcats lost
starting quarterback and Heisman Trophy candidate Collin Klein
with an undisclosed injury.  Oregon moved past Notre Dame after outscoring the
University of  Southern California  62-51 two days ago.  Notre Dame 
needed three overtimes before defeating Pittsburgh 29-23 to
improve to 9-0 for the first time since 1993.  Alabama has a .996 rating out of 1.000 in the standings,
which are determined using the USA Today coaches’ poll, Harris
Interactive poll and six computer rankings. Kansas State is at
.932, followed by Oregon at .917 and Notre Dame at .905.  Georgia (8-1) is the highest-ranked one-loss team at No. 5
and is followed by fellow Southeastern Conference schools
Florida (8-1), LSU (7-2), South Carolina (7-2). Louisville (9-0)
and Florida State (8-1) round out the top 10.  The top two teams in the final BCS standings on Dec. 2 will
play in the national championship game on Jan. 7 in Miami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
