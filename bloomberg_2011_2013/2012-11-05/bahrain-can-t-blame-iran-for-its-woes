If there were any doubts that things were going to get nastier in Bahrain, they were dispelled when five home-made  bombs went off   in the heart of the capital Manama today, killing two people. The monarchy has been trying to keep a lid on unrest sparked by the Arab Spring, going so far as to ban all demonstrations a week ago. Yet dissension has continued to bubble. That bombings would be a next stage was presaged by the discovery, in raids on two towns in July, of five tons of explosives, some  packaged into bombs  containing hundreds of iron balls to produce maximum carnage. Bahrain's Sunni rulers have blamed Shiite  Iran  for stirring up Bahrain's Shiites, who are a majority in the country and dominate its opposition. But a  government inquiry  failed to uncover evidence of Iranian meddling in the initial unrest in February 2011. Of course, that doesn't rule out the possibility of subsequent Iranian mischief-making. Still, blaming outsiders lets the monarchy off too easily. Instead, Bahrain's rulers should  seriously address  the complaints of the Shiite community. Grievances include the job demotions of thousands of Shiites after the 2011 protests and gerrymandering that dilutes Shiite representation in the elected chamber of the National Assembly. At a Nov. 7 meeting in Bahrain, foreign ministers of the  Gulf Cooperation Council  are expected to discuss how to cope with the tensions in Bahrain and  Kuwait , where protests  recently broke out . A GCC military force led by  Saudi Arabia  crushed the February 2011 unrest in Bahrain, leading to today's more radicalized rebellion. The convening foreign ministers would do well to consider how to open up their political systems to prevent further conflict rather than how to bottle it up.
