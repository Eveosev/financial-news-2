Oil-tanker rates have jumped for
vessels hauling refined fuel cargoes from the Caribbean and
 Europe  on strengthening export volumes from the U.S. Gulf,
according to investment bank Dahlman Rose & Co.  Earnings for tankers jumped to $25,000 a day compared with
an average this year so far of $10,000,  Omar Nokta , a New York-
based analyst, said in an e-mailed report today.  A ship can transport gasoline from the U.S. Gulf to  Brazil ,
and after unloading, it can sail to  Venezuela , and collect
another cargo of the road fuel bound for the U.S. Atlantic
Coast. After unloading the shipment, the vessel is then able to
return to the gulf and load a diesel cargo for Europe. It can
then return carrying gasoline to the U.S. Atlantic Coast. This
trading pattern, known as triangulation, increases a ship’s
utilization rate and boosts earnings, Nokta said.  “Strength across the various routes globally is likely to
keep vessel supply in check, leading to higher highs and higher
lows,” for spot or single-journey rates, Nokta said in the
report. “Considering peak winter season trading activity is on
the horizon, and rates are at a high base already, it seems
likely that the next 3-4 months will be quite beneficial to
product tanker owners.”  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
