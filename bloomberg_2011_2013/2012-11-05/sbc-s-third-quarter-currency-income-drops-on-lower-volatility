HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , the fifth-largest
currency dealer as ranked by  Euromoney Institutional Investor
Plc (ERM) , said foreign-exchange income declined in the quarter ended
Sept. 30 from a year earlier.  While combined revenue from financial markets improved 71
percent to $2.2 billion, income from foreign exchange decreased
20 percent to $736 million, because of a decline in “market
volatility compared to the particularly high levels of 3Q
2011,” the London-based bank said today in a regulatory
statement.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  UBS AG (UBSN) , the first- and fourth-placed
currency dealers, said last week their foreign-exchange incomes
fell in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
