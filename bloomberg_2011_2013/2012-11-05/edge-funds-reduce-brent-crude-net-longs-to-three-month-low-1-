Hedge funds  and other money managers
reduced bullish bets on  Brent crude  in the week ended Oct. 30 to
the lowest level in almost three months, according to  data from
ICE Futures Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 91,462 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report. That’s down by 2,545 lots, or 2.7 percent, from
94,007 last week and is the lowest since Aug. 7.  Bearish bets by producers, merchants, processors and users
of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 90,036, compared with
76,788 lots last week. Swaps dealers were net-long 33,568
contracts, from 22,527 a week earlier.  Brent crude on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange rose 0.8
percent in the week to Oct. 30, settling at $109.08 a barrel
that day. Brent traded at $105.68 at 12:10 p.m. London time.  Money managers’ net-long bets on ICE  gasoil  futures and
options fell to 73,197 positions from 75,740 last week,  the data
showed .  In the U.S., hedge funds cut bullish oil bets to the lowest
level in almost five months as  Hurricane Sandy  forced the
shutdown of U.S. East Coast refineries.  Money managers reduced  wagers  on rising crude prices for
the fourth time in five weeks, trimming net-long positions by 11
percent in the seven days ended Oct. 30, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders report on Nov. 2
showed. It was the least since the week ended June 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
