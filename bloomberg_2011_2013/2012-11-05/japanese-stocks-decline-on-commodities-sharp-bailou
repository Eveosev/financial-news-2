Japanese  stocks  fell, halting a
three-day gain, as Sharp Corp. dropped on speculation the
electronics maker will seek a bailout after forecasting a record
loss and as commodity prices fell.  Sharp lost 6.7 percent. Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. lost
2.9 percent.  Yamada Denki Co. (9831)  sank 7.5 percent after the
electronics retailer cut its earnings forecast. Utilities fell
after a regulator delayed a decision on whether to take reactors
at a Kansai Electric Power Co. plant offline.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) 
rose 2.2 percent after South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia
Motors Corp. overstated fuel-economy estimates for some of their
models.  “ Japan ’s corporate earnings are clearly bad, dragging down
the markets,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in Tokyo at
Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees about $75 billion.
“Commodities declined because investors had expected stimulus
measures to boost the global economy by providing liquidity but
it isn’t improving as much as expected.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.5 percent to 9,007.44
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo , with volume almost 20 percent
below the 30-day average ahead of tomorrow’s U.S. presidential
election. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index lost 0.6 percent to 747.95,
with more than two shares dropping for each that gained.  Global Stimulus  The Topix has risen 4 percent since Sept. 6 after the
 European Central Bank  started a global wave of stimulus to boost
growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the  Bank of Japan 
following suit. Shares on the equity gauge traded at 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.2 percent. The gauge fell
0.9 percent at the end of last week even after U.S. employers
added more workers than expected in October. President  Barack
Obama  is leading Republican challenger Governor  Mitt Romney  by 3
points, according to an Oct. 31-Nov. 3 Pew Research Center
survey.  Commodities Fall  Commodity related companies declined after crude oil for
December delivery sank 2.6 percent to $84.86 a barrel in New
York on Nov. 2, the lowest settlement since July 10. The London
Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial metals
including copper and aluminum yesterday slumped 1.7 percent on
Nov. 2, the biggest drop since Oct. 19.  Mitsui Mining sank 2.9 percent to 165 yen. Inpex Corp.,
Japan’s largest oil explorer by market value, slid 1.3 percent
to 434,500 yen.  “Judging from the current real economy, the conditions
aren’t there for commodity prices to rise,” said  Kenichi
Hirano , general manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities
in Tokyo. “In Japan, many companies cut their earnings
forecasts, discouraging investors to buy shares.”  Japan’s earnings season peaked last week, with 570 of the
1,675 Topix companies reporting results. Of the 240 companies on
the Topix which have reported quarterly revenue since Oct. 1 and
for which  Bloomberg News  has estimates, 65 percent have missed
projections.  Yamada Denki  Yamada Denki sank 7.5 percent to 3,170 yen after cutting
its net income forecast 40 percent to 34 billion yen ($422
million), citing slumping demand for televisions and digital
recorders.  Ebara Corp. (6361)  plunged 9.8 percent to 294 yen, the most on the
Nikkei 225. The pump maker today said its loss more than tripled
to 1.05 billion yen in the six months ended Sept. 30, with a 7
percent drop in sales. The company cut its full-year profit
forecast 19 percent to 10.5 billion yen.  Utilities declined after Japan delayed a decision on the
future of  Kansai Electric ’s Ohi nuclear plant as seismologists
under the Nuclear Regulation Authority conflicted over whether a
fault line under the site is active or not.  Kansai Electric tumbled 6.8 percent to 575 yen. Hokkaido
Electric Power Co. fell 4.5 percent to 640 yen.  Sharp Drops  Sharp slid 6.7 percent to 154 yen after  Fitch Ratings 
lowered the electronics maker’s long-term issuer default rating
to B- from BBB-, keeping a negative outlook. With 200 billion
yen of convertible bonds maturing in 2013, Sharp may have to ask
the state Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. or Innovation
Network Corp. of Japan for money, said Fumiaki Sato, co-founder
of Sangyo Sosei Advisory Inc.  Among companies that gained, Toyota rose 2.2 percent to
3,210 yen. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Nov.
2 that Hyundai and Kia overstated estimates of fuel economy on
various models, and must re-label the window stickers. At the
close of market today, Toyota raised its full-year profit
forecast as rising demand for the Prius hybrid in the U.S. and
Japan helped make up for slumping sales in China.  Minebea Co. (6479)  gained the most on the Nikkei 225, rising 7.3
percent to 279 yen. Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a daily note
the bearing maker is undervalued, maintaining its buy rating. On
Nov. 2, the company cut its full-year net-income forecast 41
percent to 7.4 billion yen, citing slumping sales of products
used for disk drives and cars.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  climbed 3.5
percent to 19.06, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5.5
percent on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  -- With assistance from Toshiro Hasegawa in Tokyo. Editors: Jim
