Swings (INDU)  in U.S. stocks have shrunk to
the lowest level in six years, an indicator that has most often
coincided with incumbent parties keeping the presidency in data
going back to 1900.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained or lost 0.54
percent a day on average this year, the smallest fluctuations
for an election year since  George W. Bush  defeated  John Kerry  in
2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Daily changes
have trailed the 112-year average of 0.75 percent in 13 of 17
instances when incumbents won, compared with six of 11 times the
parties lost, the data show.  While  volatility  doesn’t predict winners, its decline shows
less concern that prices will be whipsawed by economic news, a
potential benefit for President Barack Obama. At the same time,
the Dow’s 65 percent rally since he took office never pushed it
above the record 14,164.53 reached in October 2007. No Democrat
since World War II has held on to the White House with the Dow
this far from its peak.  “The incumbent tends to get re-elected when the market is
doing well,”  James McDonald , chief investment strategist at
 Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS)  in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.
His firm manages $750 billion. “If the market has done well,
that means the economy is doing well, that means the incumbent
has a better chance.”  Investor Psychology  The Dow declined 0.1 percent  last week  to 13,093.16,
bringing its 2012 gain to 7.2 percent and leaving the measure of
30 of America’s biggest companies 7.6 percent below the record
high reached in October 2007. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
advanced 0.2 percent as employers created more jobs than
forecast. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to 1,417.26 at 4 p.m. New
York time today, and the Dow added 0.2 percent to 13,112.44.  Obama’s odds for re-election have risen and fallen with
U.S. equities, climbing since June as a rebound in manufacturing
and home sales sent the Dow up 8.2 percent, according to
Intrade.com.  On average, the Dow has gained 9.3 percent in years before
incumbent parties retain office and fallen 4.5 percent when they
lost, data going back to 1900 show. Obama is leading Republican
challenger  Mitt Romney  by 3 points heading into tomorrow’s
contest, according to an Oct. 31-Nov. 3 Pew Research Center
survey.  Stock  volatility , while guaranteeing nothing politically,
is a barometer for investor psychology, according to  Alan Gayle ,
a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in
Richmond, Virginia, which oversees about $47 billion.  Dow Swings  Daily changes in the Dow reached 0.95 percent in the third
year of Obama’s presidency, the fifth highest since the Great
Depression, when S&P stripped the U.S. government of its AAA
credit rating and concern grew that Europe would fail to contain
its debt crisis. With swings of 1.5 percent in the third quarter
last year, the S&P 500  fell  19 percent from April 29 to Oct. 3.  Fluctuations may have abated just in time for Obama.
Incumbent parties have lost all four elections when daily
changes averaged 0.94 percent or more in since 1900, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was above that level when  John McCain  lost in 2008, when Al Gore was defeated in 2000, when
Franklin D. Roosevelt beat Herbert Hoover in 1932 and when
Warren G. Harding prevailed over James M. Cox in 1920.  The last time daily changes were lower than this year was
2006, when they averaged 0.47 percent.  Fed Easing  The Federal Reserve’s third round of bond purchases,
forecasts for rising earnings and signs Europe’s debt crisis
isn’t worsening helped calm markets in 2012. Average moves less
than 0.75 percent a day preceded the election of George W. Bush
in 2004,  Bill Clinton  in 1996 and  Ronald Reagan  in 1984.  Jimmy Carter  lost when swings were 0.76 percent in 1980, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Obama defeated McCain after the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 spurred the biggest  stock-market
retreat  in seven decades. The Dow average gained or lost an
average of 1.63 percent a day that year, the most since 1933,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Clinton beat Bob Dole in 1996
when the Dow posted an average change of 0.58 percent.  Daily  volatility  in all 30 Dow companies declined this year
from 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Seven of the
10 best-performing stocks in 2012 had swings fall by 0.4
percentage point or more.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  had the worst
performance in 2012, dropping 47 percent, and its average daily
changes of 1.5 percent this year were higher than the 29 other
Dow stocks, data show.  Bank Earnings  Fluctuations in Bank of America Corp., which has led the
Dow in 2012, slumped to 2 percent from 2.5 percent in 2011, the
data show.  Shares (BAC)  of the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets
have surged 77 percent as earnings exceeded analyst estimates
and are forecast to jump 76 percent in 2013.  3M Co. (MMM) , the manufacturer of products including Scotch tape
and dental braces, had the biggest decrease in daily swings in
2012 among Dow stocks. Volatility dropped by half to 0.7 percent
a day this year, as the shares rallied 8.9 percent, 1.7
percentage points more than the Dow.  Unlike Obama, who has enjoyed a 7.2 percent  rally  in the
Dow this year, the last years of Bush presidencies in 1992 and
2008 were accompanied by a sputtering market. The average
climbed 1.8 percent through the end of October before Clinton
was elected and slid 30 percent before Republicans lost in 2008.  Exceptions to indicators such as volatility make them
statistically meaningless and just as much evidence suggests
Obama will be defeated, according to  David Goerz , the chief
investment officer at Highmark Capital Management Inc., which
oversees about $17 billion of assets.  Incumbent Party  George H.W. Bush  gave up the White House in 1992 following
a year in which daily Dow swings were just 0.52 percent, the
lowest in seven years. The incumbent party has lost on five
other occasions when daily moves were below average: Gerald Ford
in 1976, Hubert Humphrey in 1968,  Richard Nixon  in 1960, Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and William Taft in 1912.  While the Dow is in the midst of a four-year bull market,
it hasn’t surpassed its  record  of 14,164.53 from five years ago,
and that shortfall is inconsistent with previous Democrat
victories. When  Lyndon Johnson  retained office in 1964 and
Clinton won in 1996, the average had reached an all-time high
within the previous month. Stevenson, Carter and Gore lost when
the Dow was no closer than 6.4 percent to a record the week
before the election.  Slowest Recovery  Obama has overseen the slowest post-recession recovery
since the Great Depression. The U.S. will expand 2 percent in
2013, below this year’s rate, according to the median estimate
in a survey of 89 economists by Bloomberg. While the
 unemployment rate  slipped to 7.9 percent last month from a 26-
year-high of 10 percent in October 2009, no president has ever
been re-elected when joblessness exceeded 6 percent.  Gains in stocks this year reflect investor optimism that
Romney will take office and address the so-called fiscal cliff
of more than $600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts
that are set to kick in automatically next year, according to
Philip Orlando, the New York-based chief equity strategist at
 Federated Investors Inc. (FII) , which oversees about $364.1 billion  “There was an expectation that Governor Romney was going
to win,” Orlando said in a telephone interview. “The fiscal
cliff situation was going to be successfully diffused and we
were going to see more pro-growth fiscal policies.”  Obama’s betting odds have fluctuated with the stock market.
Since the S&P 500 reached a one-year low of 1,099.23 on Oct. 3,
2011, the price of contracts that pay if he wins at Dublin-based
bookmaker Intrade climbed from $4.65 for a $10 wager to $6.14 in
May. Investors today put the odds at 65.8 percent versus 34.2
percent for Romney.  Election Polls  The Oct. 31.-Nov. 3 survey by the Pew Research Center found
Obama led Romney 48 percent to 45 percent, a gain for the
president compared with the week before when the two were tied
at 47 percent. An ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll
conducted Oct. 28-31 had the race a dead heat, at 49 percent for
each candidate.  Stocks may gain no matter who wins, if the polls and past
elections are any guide. Closer presidential races generate
bigger rallies after the victor is chosen, with the S&P 500
rallying an average of 5 percent by the end of the year when one
candidate led by about 3 percentage points or fewer, Deutsche
Bank AG wrote in a note Oct. 25.  A rally that size would put the S&P 500 at about 1,484 by
the end of the year. That’s above the average of Wall Street
strategists, who estimate the index will surpass its all-time
high in 2013, as earnings expand 4.9 percent to a record $106.27
a share, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Presidential Races  In 28 presidential races since 1900, the Dow has gained 17
times between election day and the end of the year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The mean return is 1.6 percent.  The gain in U.S. stocks has come as earnings increased an
average 23 percent for the past four years. Although  profit
growth  was flat for the second quarter and less than 1 percent
so far in the third, it is forecast to increase 6.4 percent in
the last three months of the year. Earnings have helped keep the
 S&P 500 trading  at a 15 percent discount to its five-decade
average this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  John Carey , at Pioneer Investments, says equities have been
gaining as investors bet policies will remain in place, helping
companies keep earnings expanding and share prices rising.  “It’s uncertainty,” Carey, who helps oversee about $200
billion at Pioneer Investments in Boston, said in a telephone
interview. “The market tends to favor the status quo and a
continuation of the current situation so that it can focus on
earnings and economic data.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
