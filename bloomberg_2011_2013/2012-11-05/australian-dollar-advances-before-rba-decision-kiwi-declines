The Australian dollar rose against
most major counterparts before the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia 
announces an interest-rate decision.  The Aussie gained even as 20 of 27 economists in a
Bloomberg  survey  forecast a quarter-percentage point reduction
in the nation’s benchmark lending rate to 3 percent. New
Zealand’s dollar weakened versus the yen and was little changed
versus the  U.S. dollar  as global stocks declined before
Americans vote today in the nation’s presidential election.  “The Australian dollar was among a handful of pro-risk
currencies that weathered today’s strong haven flows with
aplomb,” Ravi Bharadwaj, a market analyst in Washington at
Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co.,
wrote yesterday to clients. “Economists still believe weak
employment gains and ebbing benefits from the nation’s resource
boom will force the RBA to assume a more accommodative monetary
policy stance.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.3 percent to $1.0365 yesterday in
New York. The currency gained 0.1 percent to 83.22 yen. The  New
Zealand dollar , nicknamed the kiwi, traded at 82.52 U.S. cents
after dropping 0.2 percent to that level on Nov. 2. The kiwi
fell 0.2 percent to 66.26 yen.  The MSCI World Index of stocks fell as much as 0.6 percent
before paring the loss to 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
