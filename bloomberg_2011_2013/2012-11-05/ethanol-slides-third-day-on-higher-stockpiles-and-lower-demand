Ethanol futures declined for a third
day in  Chicago  on ample supply and lower demand for the corn-
based biofuel.  Prices dropped on speculation consumption isn’t robust
enough to wilt  stockpiles  that at 19.2 million barrels are 12
percent higher than a year earlier, Energy Department data show.
Ethanol is blended with gasoline to stretch supply and meet
federal mandates.  “You still have a heavy market in general,” said  Chris
Wilson , an analyst at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in
Galena,  Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for November delivery slipped 3 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $2.31 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since Sept. 27. Futures have advanced 4.9
percent this year. The contract expired today.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf tumbled
4.5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.45 a gallon and in New York the
additive dropped 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.465, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$2.37 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel added 1.5
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.54.  The futures price for the biofuel also sank as corn
declined, Wilson said.  “They’ve been trading pretty close day to day,” he said.
“It’s seemed to have found a sweet spot with corn.”  Corn for December delivery sank 4 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$7.355 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 34 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Gasoline for December delivery increased 4.66 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.6202 a gallon in  New York . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel increased to 31.02
cents from 23.36 cents Nov. 2. Gasoline traded at a premium of
99.8 cents to ethanol as recently as Sept. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
