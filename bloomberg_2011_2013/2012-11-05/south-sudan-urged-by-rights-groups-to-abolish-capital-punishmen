South  Sudan  should abolish the death
penalty, urged a coalition of rights groups that said most of
the country’s 200 death-row inmates receive no legal council.  The groups, including London-based Amnesty International,
Human Rights Watch of the U.S. and the South Sudan Law Society,
called on the country to vote in December on a United Nations
resolution to ban the death penalty, according to a letter to
Foreign Affairs Minister Nhial Deng received by e-mail today.  “President Salva Kiir Mayardit should immediately declare
an official moratorium on executions, and the government should
urgently address the continuing shortcomings in the country’s
administration of justice,” Audrey Gaughran, Africa director at
Amnesty International, said in the letter.  South Sudan will review death-penalty legislation as part
of the process of writing a new constitution for the East
African nation, which declared independence from Sudan in July
2011, government spokesman Barnaba Marial Benjamin said in a
phone interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
