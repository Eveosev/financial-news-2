Peter Odemwingie scored twice as West
Bromwich Albion beat Southampton 2-0 to move up to fifth place
in English soccer’s Premier League and leave its opponent bottom
of the standings.  Odemwingie opened the scoring for the home team at The
Hawthorns last night with a 36th-minute shot from outside the
penalty area and doubled the lead in the 60th minute by
finishing a counterattack with a diving header.  The win followed stoppage-time losses against Manchester
City and Newcastle and lifted the Baggies above four London
clubs in the 20-team standings with 17 points through 10 games.
It was also West Brom’s first Premier League win on a Monday
after 13 previous failures, according to Infostrada Sports.  “To bounce back from the last two difficult games where we
lost like we did was superb,” West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster
said in a televised interview. “We have conceded some unlucky
goals recently so it is great to get back to winning ways and
also keep a clean sheet.”  Southampton, which was promoted from the second-tier
Championship, fell to its fifth straight away league defeat and
remains in last place behind Queens Park Rangers on goal
difference. Both teams have four points.  Manchester United has a one-point lead over Chelsea atop
the standings, with Manchester City a point further back.  To contact the reporter on this story:
