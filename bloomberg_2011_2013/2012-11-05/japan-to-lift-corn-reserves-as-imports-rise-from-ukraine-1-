Japan, the world’s largest corn
importer, is set to spend $20 million to help feed mills boost
stockpiles and safeguard  food security  as the nation shifts
purchases from the U.S. to Ukraine and  Brazil .  Feed makers will probably expand inventories to 750,000
metric tons in the 12 months starting April 1, or about 7
percent of consumption, from 450,000 tons this year, said
Ryosuke Hirooka, deputy director for the feed division of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The government
may spend 1.62 billion yen to meet part of the cost, he said in
an interview in  Tokyo .  Japan purchased a record amount of corn from Brazil and
Ukraine this year, cutting U.S. supplies to the lowest level in
at least two decades, as drought sent Chicago futures to a
record. Shipments from  South America  and  Europe  were delayed,
forcing feed mills to draw on stockpiles, Hirooka said.  “Diversification of supply raises the risk of instability
in shipments” because transport facilities in some  emerging
markets  are not as good as the U.S., said Tetsuhide Mikamo,
director at Marubeni Research Institute. “Holding higher
stockpiles is one option for managing the risk.”  An increase in inventories may curb the decline in corn
imports, which have slumped to a 26-year low as feed mills use
more wheat. The U.S. was the top corn exporter in the 2011-2012
marketing year, followed by Brazil,  Argentina  and Ukraine, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show.  Brazil, Ukraine  The U.S. supplied 5.1 million tons of feed corn to Japan in
the first eight months, or 78 percent of imports, according to
the agriculture ministry. Ukraine shipped a record 822,226 tons,
or 13 percent. The U.S. provided virtually all the country’s
requirements in 2008.  Japan continues to boost purchases of cheaper corn from
South America and the Black Sea, eroding U.S. market share, said
 Nobuyuki Chino , president at Continental Rice Corp. The U.S. is
set to supply 1.5 million tons or 56 percent of imports in the
first quarter of 2013, said Chino, who has traded grains for
more than three decades. Brazil will provide 800,000 tons and
Argentina 150,000 tons, while Ukraine and others ship the rest.  The cost of importing Brazilian corn, including  freight , is
about $35 per ton cheaper than the U.S. variety, Chino said.
Argentine corn is offered $30 below U.S. grain, while Ukrainian
shipments are $15 less expensive, he said.  Japan’s corn imports for feed, food and industrial use may
drop almost 3 percent this year from 15.3 million tons in 2011
to the lowest since 1986, said Chino. Feed makers are also using
dried distillers’ grains with solubles instead of corn.  Futures in  Chicago  climbed to a record $8.49 a bushel on
Aug. 10 and traded at $7.39 at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
