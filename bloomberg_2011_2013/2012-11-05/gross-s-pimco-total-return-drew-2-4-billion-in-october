Bill Gross ’s  Pimco Total Return Fund (PTTRX) ,
the world’s biggest mutual fund, attracted $2.4 billion last
month as it continued to outperform peers.  The 10th straight month of net deposits into the fund
contributed to about $14.5 billion in new cash for the year
through Oct. 31 and helped lift assets to $281 billion, Chicago-
based research firm  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  said today in an e-mail.
Deposits of $2.8 billion in September were the highest this
year.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Total Return Fund
advanced 9.5 percent this year through last week, beating 95
percent of similarly run mutual funds, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. The fund lost $5 billion to withdrawals
in 2011, according to Morningstar, as Gross endured what he
termed “a stinker” after eliminating U.S. Treasuries early in
the year and missing a rally when investors rushed to the safety
of government-backed debt.  Gross has reduced his holdings of Treasuries and government
debt for three straight months. The allocation was 20 percent as
of Sept. 30, according to the company’s website, the lowest
level since last October.  Pimco, based in  Newport Beach , California, is a unit of
Munich-based insurer Allianz SE. Allianz said last week its
asset-management division contributed “especially” to third-
quarter earnings as its funds pulled in more deposits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
