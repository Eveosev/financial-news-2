lowest in four months as Glencore International Plc sold barges.  Hedge funds and other money managers reduced  bullish bets 
on gasoil to the least in 10 weeks, according to data from the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  Light Products  Barges of gasoline for loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp hub traded from $921 to $923 a metric ton, according to
a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus
Bulletin Board. That’s the lowest since June 28 and compares
with Nov. 2 trades from $930 to $944.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Trafigura Beheer BV bought the
Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.

a barrel as of 11:11 a.m. local time, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and products broker in  London .
That’s up from $3.32 the previous session.  Naphtha’s  crack , or discount to Brent, widened 13 cents to
$3.94 a barrel, PVM data showed.  Middle Distillates  Speculative bets that gasoil prices will rise, in futures

lots and is the lowest since Aug. 21.  Gasoil for November delivery fell $1.50, or 0.2 percent, to
$923.50 a ton on ICE as of 12:26 p.m. London time. The December

barrel.  Refineries  French oil-refinery employees will strike today to protest
the closure of the Petit-Couronne plant in Normandy, as Industry

decision on its future.  Refinery workers across the country plan to stop work, the
Confederation Generale du Travail said in a statement. While the
court is due to meet today, Montebourg is seeking more time to

the nation’s sovereign wealth fund, he said on RTL radio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
