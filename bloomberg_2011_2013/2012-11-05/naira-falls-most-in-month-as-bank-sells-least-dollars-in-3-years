Nigeria’s naira weakened the most in
a month after the central bank sold the lowest amount of dollars
at an auction in more than three years.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest crude producer retreated
0.4 percent to 157.4 a dollar by 4:30 p.m. in Lagos, the biggest
decline since Oct. 5. That pares gains this year to 3.1 percent,
the second-best performance in Africa, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Nigeria sold $29.88 million at an
auction today, the lowest amount since October 2009, according
to data on the Abuja-based bank’s website.  “The supply was not enough for the interbank market where
lenders trade the foreign currency to meet the need of their
customers,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer of Lagos-
based Valuechain Investment Ltd., said by phone.  The central bank, led by Governor Lamido Sanusi, has left
the benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record 12 percent
this year, increased lenders’ reserve requirements and limited
access to money auctions to stop dealers from buying foreign
currency using naira purchased from the bank at a discount.  “The central bank limits access to its auction and
therefore to official reserves,” Gregory Kronsten, head of
economic research at FBN Capital Ltd. in  London , wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients today.  The nation’s  foreign-exchange reserves  have increased 29
percent this year to $42.67 billion as of Oct. 31, according to
data on the central bank’s website.  The yield on the nation’s 16.39 percent naira debt due
January 2022 was unchanged at 12.89 percent, according to
today’s prices compiled by the Lagos-based Financial Markets
Dealers Association. The yield on the country’s $500 million of
Eurobonds due January 2021 was down 4 basis points at 4.424
percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated 0.4 percent to 1.8819 a dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
