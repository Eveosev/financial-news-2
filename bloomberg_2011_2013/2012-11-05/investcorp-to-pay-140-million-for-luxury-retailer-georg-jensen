Investcorp Bank BSC, a Bahrain-based
alternative  investment company , agreed to pay $140 million to
buy Scandinavian luxury retailer Georg Jensen and said itâ€™s
planning to turn the company into a global franchise.  Investcorp will acquire the company from private equity
group Axcel Capital Partners, it said in an e-mailed statement
today. David Chu, founder of clothing company Nautica, will join
Georg Jensen after the deal closes as chief creative director
and co-chairman of the board, according to the company.  Denmark-based Georg Jensen designs, manufactures and
distributes jewellery, watches, and silverware. The company was
bought by Axcel in 2001 and has 94 fully owned and three
franchised stores and had sales of about $160 million in 2011.  Investcorp will work with the current management team led
by Ulrik Garde Due and David Chu to expand globally.  Investcorp had $11.5 billion of assets under management at
the end of June, and its businesses include private equity, real
estate investing and the U.S. and global hedge funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
