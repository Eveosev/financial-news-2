Centum Investment Co. (CENTUM) , Kenya’s
largest publicly traded investment group, fell the most in more
than four months after saying companies that contribute 20
percent of profit lost a court case over taxes.  The stock slid for a second day, dropping 3.9 percent to
12.40 shillings by the close in Nairobi, the biggest decline
since June 19. About 79 percent of the three-month daily average
of shares traded.  Kenya’s  High Court  dismissed a case filed by four Coca-Cola
bottlers in which Centum has invested, the company said Nov. 2.
The units filed the case against the  Kenya Revenue Authority 
over excise duty amounting to 5 billion Kenyan shillings ($58.5
million). The bottlers plan to appeal the ruling, Centum said.  “Investors’ confidence will be affected because they are
still recovering from not receiving a profit warning before the
full-year profit fell and these bottling companies account for
20 percent of their profit, which is significant,” Faith Atiti,
an analyst at Nairobi-based NIC Securities Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  In June the company was fined by the East African country’s
 Capital Markets Authority  for not issuing a warning before
reporting a 48 percent drop in annual profit. Net income in the
12 months through March fell to 1.19 billion shillings, the
company said June 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
