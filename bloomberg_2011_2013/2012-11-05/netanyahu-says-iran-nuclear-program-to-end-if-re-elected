Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , who faces national elections in January, said the
Iranian nuclear program would cease to exist by the end of his
next term, should he be re-elected  “The responsibility, in the end, is that of the prime
minister,” Netanyahu said when asked if Israel could decide to
strike  Iran  even if the military chief of staff opposed such a
move.  The prime minister was interviewed following the airing of
a investigative news report that said Netanyahu and Defense
Minister  Ehud Barak  asked the military at a specific meeting in
2010 to prepare a strike on  Iran’s nuclear program .  Israel’s military and foreign intelligence service heads
opposed the order, expressing doubts over their preparedness and
the effectiveness of the strike, according to Channel 2.
Netanyahu declined to comment on the details of that report.  Netanyahu has said that Iran’s nuclear program poses an
existential threat to Israel and that “all options are on the
table.” Iranian leaders say the program is intended only for
civilian use, and have refused to curtail the activities despite
international economic sanctions.  The Israeli leader said that the point of his increasing
pressure to stop the Iranian nuclear program is “to show the
world powers that  Israel  is serious and that this isn’t just for
show.”  Netanyahu called early elections last month and the poll
has been set for Jan. 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
