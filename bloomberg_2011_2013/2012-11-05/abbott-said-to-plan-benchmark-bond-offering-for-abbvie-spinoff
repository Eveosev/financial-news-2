Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  sold $14.7
billion of bonds yesterday in the largest dollar-denominated
offering in more than three years as the drug and medical-device
maker prepares to split in two.  Abbott issued bonds in six parts through its AbbVie Inc.
pharmaceutical unit, ranging in size from $500 million to $4
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will
help fund a $7.7 billion tender offer related to AbbVie’s
spinoff.  The offering is the largest dollar-denominated sale since
February 2009, when  Roche Holding AG  issued $16 billion of debt,
Bloomberg data show. Following disruptions last week to the
market from  Hurricane Sandy , the biggest Atlantic storm in
history, companies are issuing debt and seizing advantage of
near record-low borrowing costs  “This has been a deal that’s been pretty well
anticipated,” Scott Kimball, a  money manager  at Taplin Canida &
Habacht LLC, a BMO Financial Group unit that oversees $7.3
billion, said in a telephone interview. “The  bond market  missed
a few days last week to closures. You’re probably finding some
pent up demand.”  The portions include $500 million of three-year floating-
rate notes that priced to yield 76 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate and $3.5 billion of
1.2 percent, three-year fixed-rate debentures to yield 85 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show.  Investor Demand  The fixed-rate bonds due November 2015 rose 0.5 cent from
the issue price to 100.4 cents on the dollar for a yield of 1.1
percent at 11:54 a.m. in  New York  today, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  In addition, the company sold $4 billion of 1.75 percent,
five-year bonds at a relative yield of 110 basis points, $1
billion of 2 percent, six-year notes at a spread of 140 basis
points, $3.1 billion of 2.9 percent, 10-year debt at 130 basis
points, and $2.6 billion of 4.4 percent, 30-year securities at
160, the data show. The six-year bond was added after the deal’s
announcement, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly.  The deal’s size “makes sense given the demand technicals
in the market,”  Ashish Shah , head of global credit investments
at New York-based AllianceBernstein LP, which oversees $230
billion in fixed-income assets, said in a telephone interview.
“It’s a good time to be an issuer in the bond market.”  Top-Selling Drug  Abbott, which makes the world’s top-selling medicine, the
arthritis drug Humira, previously issued debt in May 2010,
selling $1.25 billion of 5.3 percent, 30-year bonds, $1 billion
of 4.125 percent, 10-year securities and $750 million of 2.7
percent, five-year debt, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bonds due May 2020 traded at 116.1 cents on the
dollar to yield 1.84 percent on Oct. 18, Trace data show.  The bonds are rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service, the
ratings company said yesterday in a statement.  “AbbVie’s Baa1 rating reflects the blockbuster success of
Humira and the product’s good growth outlook, offset by higher
leverage and greater product concentration risk than
pharmaceutical peers,” Michael Levesque, Moody’s analyst, wrote
in the report.  Adelle Infante, a spokeswoman for Abbott, declined to
comment on the sale.  Abbott made a tender offer for four bonds with $4.75
billion outstanding and as much as 47.2 percent on five other
issues with $6.25 billion, the company said in an Oct. 26
statement.  Cash Distribution  Proceeds from the offering will be used to provide a net
cash distribution to  Abbott Park , Illinois-based Abbott of about
$8.5 billion to complete the separation, Chief Financial Officer
Thomas Freyman said on an Oct. 17 conference call. AbbVie plans
to raise about $16 billion of debt related to the spinoff.  It’s “a somewhat defensive industry and I’m not surprised
we’re seeing as much demand as we are,” Wilmer Stith, a
portfolio manager at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors Inc.
in Baltimore, said in a telephone interview. “Investors have an
insatiable need for achieving higher income levels.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
