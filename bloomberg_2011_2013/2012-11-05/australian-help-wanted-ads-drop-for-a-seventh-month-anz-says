Australian help-wanted notices fell
for a seventh straight month in October, signaling the nation’s
unemployment rate may rise, a private report showed.  Jobs advertised  in newspapers and on the Internet dropped
4.6 percent last month after a revised 3.9 percent fall in
September, according to an  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ)  report released in Melbourne today. National vacancies
advertised in newspapers weakened 4.1 percent, and Internet
notices were down 4.6 percent, the report showed.  “The general trend of weaker job advertising and
continuing job losses as businesses restructure and cut costs
suggests continuing upward pressure on the unemployment rate,”
said Ivan Colhoun, ANZ Bank’s head of Australian economics and
property research, in the statement.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  last month
indicated a gloomier outlook for the economy when he lowered the
benchmark  interest rate  to 3.25 percent. Traders are pricing in
a 54 percent chance he will lower borrowing costs by another
quarter percentage point tomorrow, swaps data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The Australian Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to release
October employment figures on Nov. 8. The jobless rate climbed
to 5.4 percent, a 2 1/2-year high, in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
