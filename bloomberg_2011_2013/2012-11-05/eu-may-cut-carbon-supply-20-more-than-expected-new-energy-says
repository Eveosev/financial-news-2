The European Commission, regulator of
the world’s biggest carbon market by traded volume, may next
week propose a temporary cut in supply that’s 20 percent more
than expected.  The volume of European Union carbon allowances to be
delayed in the phase starting next year proposed by the
commission on Nov. 14 may be 900 million metric tons, compared
with about 750 million tons expected by traders in a survey last
month, Konrad Hanschmidt, an analyst at the London research
company, said today in an e-mailed research note.  There is a perception among some traders that “the volume
to be announced is more likely to be above the market’s
expectations,” Hanschmidt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
