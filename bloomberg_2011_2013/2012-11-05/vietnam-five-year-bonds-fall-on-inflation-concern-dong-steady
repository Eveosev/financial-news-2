Vietnam ’s five-year government bonds
fell for the first time in two weeks on speculation consumer-
price gains may accelerate in the final months of the year. The
dong was unchanged.  The nation faces a high risk of faster  inflation , Do Thi
Nhung, deputy head of the  State Bank  of Vietnam’s monetary-
policy department, said at a conference in Hanoi today. Consumer
prices rose 7 percent in October from a year earlier, official
data show, quickening for the second month in a row.  “Investors are worried about inflation for the remainder
of the year,” said Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, head of fixed-income
trading at Asia Commercial Bank in  Ho Chi Minh City .  The yield on the benchmark five-year bonds rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 10.10 percent, according to
a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
first increase since Oct. 22.  The dong traded at 20,850 per dollar as of 2:57 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The State Bank
of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec.
26, according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade
as much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
