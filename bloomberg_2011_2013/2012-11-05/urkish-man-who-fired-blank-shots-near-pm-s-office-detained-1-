A man who fired three blank shots
near the office of Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  was

Cabinet meeting, the Istanbul-based NTV news channel said.
Police quickly detained the man, it said.  The state-run Anatolia agency, citing officials, said the
man had repeatedly written to authorities about his problems and
