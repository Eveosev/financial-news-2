A Russian policeman was arrested on
suspicion of participating in the gang rape of a 25-year-old
woman in the majority-Muslim region of Tatarstan.  The 30-year-old police officer and a 20-year-old man were
detained for their alleged sexual abuse of the woman in a
Russian steam bath, the Investigative Committee said today on
its website. The men, who will be charged soon, deny any
wrongdoing, according to the statement.  Tatarstan, in central  Russia , is witnessing a wave of
extremist violence that has spread from the countryâ€™s southern
Muslim regions, where unrest has been endemic for years. The top
cleric in Tatarstan was injured in a car blast and his deputy
shot dead in July. Last month, two militants and a Russian
special forces officer were killed in a shootout in the regional
capital of Kazan.  The killing in Tatarstan marked an escalation of religious
tensions in Russia as insurgents increasingly target local
Muslim clerics who have spoken out against Islamic militants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
