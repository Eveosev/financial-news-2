European Union President  Herman Van
Rompuy  said Scotland has nothing to gain from leaving the U.K.,
with future success dependent on pooling forces, the Herald
reported, citing a conversation posted on YouTube that van
Rompuy had about Scottish independence.  In the event of the ruling  Scottish National Party  winning
the independence referendum due to be held in 2014, Scotland
would need to reapply for EU membership, the Glasgow, Scotland-
based newspaper said, citing an unidentified person it described
as close to Van Rompuy. Spain, Belgium and Cyprus could make any
meetings about a Scottish application difficult, the person told
the Herald.  Van Rompuy’s comments about separatism to an Edinburgh
resident were recorded in a question and answer session, the
Herald said. His views haven’t changed,  Van Rompuy ’s spokesman
told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
