Cia. de Aguas e Esgotos do Rio Grande
do Norte, the Brazilian water utility known as Caern,
has proposed 734 million reais ($361 million) of water projects
in Natal under the nationâ€™s PAC-2 growth acceleration plan.  The company plans to invest 503 million reais in sewer
upgrades in the northeastern city, Caern said in a statement.
The rest will be spent expanding water supplies and boosting the
efficiency of the Jiqui water treatment plant.  The Ministry of Cities is expected to select what projects
will be pursued under the PAC-2 proposals next month, the Natal-
based company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
