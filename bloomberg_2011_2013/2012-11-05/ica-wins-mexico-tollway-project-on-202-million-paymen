Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) ,  Mexico â€™s largest
construction company, won a concession to build and operate a
tollway in Queretaro and Guanajuato states with an initial
payment of 2.63 billion pesos ($202 million) to the government.  The 30-year concession for the 86-kilometer (53-mile)
Palmillas-Apaseo el Grande road will be signed in February, and
ICA unit Conoisa pledged to complete the project in 2015, the
Ministry of Communications and Transportation said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
