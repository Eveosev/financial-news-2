Lebanon’s statistics office plans to
release gross domestic product figures annually for the first
time starting in 2013, the head of the government body said.  Maral Tutelian Guidanian, director general of the  Central
Administration of Statistics , said in an interview today that
the output figures will eventually be released every quarter,
without specifying a date.  The nation’s economic growth will decline to 2 percent this
year from 3 percent in 2011 because of lower tourism and
consumer spending caused by political tension in the region,
central bank Governor Riad Salameh said Oct. 1.  Lebanon’s inflation rate rose to 8.9 percent in July
compared with 2.1 percent in June after the housing index, which
only includes rentals, jumped 44 percent from July 2009. The
government body resumed its real estate index in July
after a three-year hiatus. Inflation accelerated to  10.3 percent 
in September, the data show.  Guidanian said she expects a spike in the consumer price
index in November, when the indexes of schools are usually
updated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
