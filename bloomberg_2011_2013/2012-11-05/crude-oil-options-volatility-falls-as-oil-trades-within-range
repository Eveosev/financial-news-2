Crude oil options volatility declined
as underlying futures prices moved within a trading range from
Oct. 24.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
December, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.93 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 2:40 p.m., down from 30.44 percent on
Nov. 2.  “It’s down a bit today,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York . “You have a
small range and it’s just moving around $85.”  December-delivery crude oil rose 79 cents to settle at
$85.65 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices fell 6.5 percent last
month. Since Oct. 24, oil has traded between $84.34 and $87.42.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $80 puts, which slid 24 cents to 17 cents on volume of
2,59 lots at 2:39 p.m. December $82 puts were the second-most
active, with 2,485 lots exchanged as they declined 40 cents to
39 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 55
percent of the 38,407 lots traded.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets made up 57 percent of
the 160,337 contracts traded.  January $70 puts were the most actively traded options Nov.
2 with 18,563 contracts. They rose 9 cents to 23 cents a barrel.
January $65 puts advanced 3 cents to 7 cents on volume of 10,229
lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
68,191 contracts. Next were December $125 calls with 46,014 lots
and December $80 puts with 42,427.  To contact the reporter on this story:
