State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest U.S. home and car insurer, received 81,260 claims related to superstorm Sandy through yesterday, led by policyholders in  New York .  New York homeowners submitted 24,700 claims and drivers in the state filed 7,325, Rachael Risinger, a company spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail.  Homeowners in nine states and the  District of Columbia  filed more than 68,000 claims since Oct. 31, State Farm said. Sandy slammed the East Coast last week, hitting hardest in New York and  New Jersey , killing more than 100 and leaving about 8.5 million homes and businesses without power at its peak. It may have caused $20 billion in insured damage, according to Hiscox Ltd., the biggest Lloyd’s of London insurer by market value.  “We suspect the bulk of the losses will be absorbed by the primary insurers like State Farm,  Allstate (ALL) , Travelers, etc. and not by the reinsurers,” said today Paul Newsome, an analyst at Sander O’Neill & Partners LP, in a note.
