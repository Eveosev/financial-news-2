Hungary’s three-year bond yields fell
for a second day and the forint weakened after three central
bank policy makers said they see further room to reduce  interest
rates  after three consecutive months of cuts.  Yields on the benchmark bonds maturing in 2015 dropped
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.159 percent
by 4:59 p.m. in Budapest. Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.1
percent to 282.42 per euro.  The inflation outlook and the improvement in risk
assessment allow the Magyar Nemzeti Bank to lower the 6.25
percent benchmark rate, central bankers Andrea Bartfai-Mager,
Ferenc Gerhardt and Gyorgy Kocziszky said in a joint interview
at their office in Budapest today. Easing must be cautious and
gradual, Bartfai-Mager said. The country’s “equilibrium
interest rate” is 4.5 percent to 5 percent, Gerhardt said.  The further easing expected from the central bank is “good
for fixed income, but not so sure for the forint,”  Benoit Anne ,
London-based head of emerging-markets strategy at Societe
Generale SA, wrote in e-mailed comments.  Central bank projections are based on the assumption that
Hungary will obtain a  credit line  from the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union, the policy makers said.  Emerging market investors don’t expect Hungary to secure an
aid deal with the IMF within three months, a Societe Generale
survey of 61  hedge funds  and “real money” investors showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
