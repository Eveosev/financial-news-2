French oil-refinery employees will
strike today to protest the shutdown of the Petit-Couronne plant
in Normandy, as Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg petitions a
regional court to delay a decision on its future.  Refinery workers across the country plan to down tools, the
 Confederation Generale du Travail  said in a statement. While the
court is due to meet today, Montebourg is seeking more time to
examine Libyan interest in the plant after being contacted by
the nation’s sovereign wealth fund, he said on RTL radio.  The 154,000-barrel-a-day site went into administration
after owner Petroplus Holdings AG filed for insolvency in
January. The plant’s suspension was the fourth in France in two
years, reflecting lower refining profits across  Europe . Petit-
Couronne was placed in liquidation last month after bids from
Alafandi Petroleum Group and Netoil Inc. were rejected.  The refinery has been operating since June under a six-
month tolling deal with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , allowing Shell to
supply crude and take ownership of the products for a fee. The
plant may shut later this month if a credible buyer or plan
isn’t approved by the court, according to the CGT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
