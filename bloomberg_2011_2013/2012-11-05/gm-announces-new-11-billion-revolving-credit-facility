General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest U.S.
automaker, reported a new $11 billion revolving  credit line 
consisting of a $5.5 billion three-year facility and a $5.5
billion five-year facility.  The new credit line replaces a $5 billion credit facility
maturing in 2015, according to a statement on GM’s website. The
expanded credit line “offers improved pricing and terms, and
the ability to borrow in currencies other than U.S. dollars,”
according to the statement. GM Financial, its captive finance
company, will also be able to borrow under the facility.  The larger credit line gives Detroit-based GM borrowing
capacity similar to  Ford Motor Co. (F) , which has $9.3 billion in
revolving credit facilities. GM said 35 financial institutions
from 14 countries participated in the syndicated transaction.  “The new revolver provides a significant source of backup
liquidity and financial flexibility, further bolstering our
fortress balance sheet,” Chief Financial Officer Dan Ammann
said in the statement.  The new credit line “represents a
strong vote of confidence in the financial strength of our
company,” he said.  GM fell 0.4 percent to $25.69 at 9:45 a.m.  New York  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
