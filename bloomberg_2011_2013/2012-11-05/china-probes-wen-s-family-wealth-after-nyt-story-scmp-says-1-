China began a probe of Premier Wen Jiabao’s wealth at his request after the  New York  Times reported
his relatives had amassed at least $2.7 billion of assets, the 
South China Morning Post reported today.  The premier called for a formal inquiry in a letter to the
Communist Party’s Politburo Standing Committee, of which he is a
member, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people.
Conservative party elders who dislike Wen’s more liberal
stance have called on him to explain the New York Times’s
reporting, the sources said, according to the South China
Morning Post.  The Times story on Wen’s family wealth cited corporate and
regulatory records and unidentified people familiar with the
family’s investments. Among the assets was a holding in the name
of Wen’s mother, Yang Zhiyun, in Ping An Insurance Co. that was
valued at $120 million in 2007, the Times reported.  A faxed request for comment to the Chinese foreign
ministry’s news department wasn’t immediately answered. On Oct.
29, the foreign ministry confirmed Wen’s family had lawyers
issue a statement responding to the Times story and suggested
the report was a bid to provoke instability. The South China
Morning Post had reported that lawyers representing Wen’s family
issued a statement disputing some of the Times story.  To contact the reporter on this story:
