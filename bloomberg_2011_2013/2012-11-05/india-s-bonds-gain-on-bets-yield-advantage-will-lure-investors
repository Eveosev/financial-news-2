India ’s 10-year bonds ended little
changed, with the yield holding near the highest level in two
months, on concern the government may borrow more than budgeted.  Policy makers will decide by the end of January or early
February if India will raise a further 250 billion rupees ($4.6
billion) by selling  government securities  or treasury bills, two
Finance Ministry officials with direct knowledge of the matter
said, asking not to be identified as they aren’t authorized to
speak on the subject. The notes had earlier gained on
speculation overseas funds will boost holdings after the central
bank held  interest rates  at the highest level among Asia’s
biggest economies.  “There is still uncertainty about the fiscal deficit and
borrowing,” said Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist at  ING Vysya
Bank Ltd. (VYSB)  in Mumbai. “I do not see much downside for yields.”  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022
was little changed at 8.20 percent from Nov. 2 in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate touched 8.22
percent on Oct. 31, the highest level since Sept. 3.  Global investors bolstered  ownership  of rupee-denominated
debt by $1.3 billion in October, the biggest increase since
February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  extra
yield  on Indian 10-year notes over similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries has climbed 21 basis points from a seven-month low of
630 reached on Oct. 18. The  Reserve Bank  of India held its
 benchmark  rate at 8 percent at an Oct. 30 review and raised its
inflation forecast for March to 7.5 percent from 7 percent.  Central bank rates are at 3 percent in  China , 2.75 percent
in South Korea and 5.75 percent in Indonesia.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.77 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. It rose 17 basis points last week in the
biggest increase since the five-day period ended June 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
