The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 20.75 cents in the past two weeks to
$3.5454 a gallon as  Hurricane Sandy  shut refineries and
terminals in the Northeast, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Nov. 2 and is based on
information obtained from about 2,500 stations by the Camarillo,
California-based company. The average is the lowest since July
27 and the decline is the steepest since December 2008. Gasoline
is 42.17 cents below the year-to-date high of $3.9671 on April
6. Prices are still up 11.65 cents from a year earlier.  The storm, which landed in southern  New Jersey  on Oct. 29,
shut filling stations, distribution terminals and Colonial
Pipeline Co.’s main pipeline to the region. Phillips 66 and  Hess
Corp. (HES)  refineries remained shut as of Nov. 2, while Philadelphia-
area plants were operating.  “We have demand destruction from storm Sandy on top of
much lower crude-oil prices,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of
Lundberg Survey, said in a telephone interview.  Gasoline futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell
12.27 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $2.5736 a gallon in the two
weeks ended Nov. 2, while West Texas Intermediate crude sank
$5.19, or 5.8 percent, to $84.86 a barrel.  Total U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  rose 935,000 barrels to
199.5 million, the third consecutive increase, the Energy
Department said Nov. 1.  Gasoline futures rose through the middle of the week on
concern supplies would be disrupted for an extended period after
Hurricane Sandy shut refineries, pipelines and terminals near
 New York  Harbor, the delivery point for Nymex futures and the
supply hub for the East Coast.  Jones Act Waiver  Prices fell at the end of the week as some of the
facilities resumed operations and the Obama administration
waived the Jones Act, increasing the tankers available to carry
fuel up to New York from the  Gulf Coast .  Customers faced miles-long lines at filling stations in New
Jersey,  New York City  and Long Island as the storm cut power to
retail pumps and wholesale terminals. The government also eased
blending restrictions to increase supply to the region.  Crude inventories  fell 2.05 million barrels in the week
ended Oct. 26 to 373.1 million barrels, according to Energy
Department data, the most for the last week of October in
records begun in 1982.  Oil may rise this week as Hurricane Sandy reduces imports
and U.S. inventories while refineries resume operation, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  Crude May Climb  Thirteen of 30 analysts, or 43 percent, forecast crude will
increase through Nov. 9. Eleven respondents, or 37 percent,
predicted a drop. Six forecast little change. Last week, 44
percent of analysts projected a decline.  Regular gasoline on  Long Island  averaged about $3.92 a
gallon, down 12 cents since Oct. 19, Lundberg said. Los Angeles-
area retail stations averaged $4, down 49 cents.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
markets surveyed was in  San Francisco , where the average was
$4.05 a gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Memphis,
 Tennessee , where customers paid an average of $3.11 a gallon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
