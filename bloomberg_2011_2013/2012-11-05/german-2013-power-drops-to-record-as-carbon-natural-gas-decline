German power for 2013 was unchanged
as coal reversed its earlier losses and European Union carbon
permits advanced.  German next-year baseload electricity, for supplies
delivered around the clock, was stable at 46.75 euros ($59.74) a
megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
It earlier fell as much as 0.5 percent to 46.50 euros, a record
for the 2013 contract.  European coal for next year rose 0.5 percent to $94 a
metric ton, after earlier falling as much as 0.6 percent,
according to the data.  Carbon for December rose 1.9 percent to 8.26 euros a metric
ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange, the highest since Oct.
17. Electricity in Europeâ€™s largest economy can track emissions
prices, which affect production costs at plants that burn fossil
fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
