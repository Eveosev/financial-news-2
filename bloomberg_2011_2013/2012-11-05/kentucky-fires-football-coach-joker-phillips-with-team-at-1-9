The  University of Kentucky  fired
football coach Joker Phillips yesterday, a day after the
Wildcats were beaten by Vanderbilt University 40-0, their worst
loss against the Commodores in 96 years.  The 49-year-old Phillips, who will coach this season’s
final two games, has a 12-23 record over three years at  Kentucky .
The Wildcats are 1-9 and 0-7 in the  Southeastern Conference 
after eight straight losses.  “Our football program is not where we want it to be and we
are all disappointed; coaches, players, administration and our
fans,” Kentucky Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart said on the
school’s website. “It is in the best interest of our athletics
program to make a change in our football coaching staff at the
conclusion of the season.”  Barnhart said the search for a new coach will begin
immediately.  Phillips played wide receiver at Kentucky from 1981-84 and
had two stints as an assistant at the school before taking over
as coach in January 2010 when Rich Brooks retired.  To contact the reporter on this story:
