A Nov. 12 meeting of finance
ministers from the euro region may fail to deliver the broad
agreement necessary to unfreeze  Greece ’s bailout, a European
official from the Group of 20 nations said.  The meeting, which Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said last week would seek a conclusion to the talks, may
just be a step in the process, according to the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are not
public. The official still expects a decision later this month.  Greece, which has received 240 billion euros ($307 billion)
in aid pledges from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund  since 2010, is under pressure to make more efforts
to rein in the  budget deficit  and deregulate the economy. That
alone won’t be enough to unblock payments as a combination of
Greek political indecision and economic weakness has jeopardized
the country’s efforts to meet a debt target of 120 percent of
gross domestic product by 2020.  The official said a package deal has to include both prior
actions by the Greek government on fiscal and economic measures
and an agreement from creditors on filling the country’s
financing gap and making its debt sustainable. A list of options
is being reviewed, according to the official.  Separately, the official said that  Spain  outlined all the
measures that it is taking to strengthen its economy and its
banking sector yesterday to the finance officials attending of a
G-20 meeting in Mexico City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
