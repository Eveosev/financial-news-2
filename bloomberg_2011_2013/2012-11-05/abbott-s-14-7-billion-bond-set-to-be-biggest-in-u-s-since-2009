Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  is planning to
sell $14.7 billion of bonds in the largest dollar-denominated
offering in more than three years as the drug and medical-device
maker prepares to split in two.  Through its AbbVie Inc. pharmaceutical unit, Abbott may
sell bonds in six parts ranging in size from $500 million to $4
billion, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The offering is the largest dollar-denominated sale since
February 2009, when  Roche Holding AG  issued $16 billion of debt,
Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
