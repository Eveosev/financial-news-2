China ’s government stimulus and a
projected increase in steel output will support iron ore prices
at about $120 a metric ton next year, said Masami Iijima, chief
executive officer of  Japan ’s biggest trader in the raw material.  “I think we saw the floor of it in the second quarter”
ending Sept. 30, Iijima of Mitsui & Co. said at a briefing in
Tokyo today. “ Europe ’s debt crisis is having an impact on
Chinese exports. But, if the stimulus works we’ll see an upward
trend in steel product prices.”  Iijima said China’s 1 trillion  yuan  ($160 billion) in state
spending announced in September means the steelmaking material
is unlikely to drop below $100 a ton.  The outlook from Mitsui, which earns about half its net
income from iron ore, comes after iron ore  price s in China fell
42 percent to $86.7 a ton on Sept. 5 from an April peak.  The iron ore price for Chinese imports at the port of
Tianjin has since recovered to $120.1 as of Nov. 2, according to
The Steel Index Ltd. Prices are set to fall for four consecutive
years from 2014, according to a Bloomberg survey of five
analysts, and may average $96 a ton in 2017.  Mitsui will seek to boost investments in agriculture,
especially in fertilizers, as a way to diversify from iron ore,
Iijima said. Mining potash and phosphate, two of the three main
fertilizer materials, are most attractive for Mitsui, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
