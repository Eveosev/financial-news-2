Canadian  building permits  fell at the
fastest pace in more than a year in September on declines in
non-residential projects.  The  value  of municipal permits fell 13.2 percent to C$6.48
billion ($6.50 billion) from a record high the prior month,
 Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. The total value of
permits is the lowest since January. Economists forecast a 2.8
percent decline according to the median of six responses to a
Bloomberg survey.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  has said companies
should take advantage of low  interest rates  and spare cash on
their balance sheets to invest and build competitiveness. The
central bank has kept its  overnight interest rate  at 1 percent
since September 2010 to encourage borrowing and spending, and
has said business investment and consumption will help lead an
economic expansion through next year.  Permits for  non-residential construction  dropped 30.8
percent to C$2.24 billion in September, reversing the prior
monthâ€™s 27.7 percent gain, Statistics Canada said.  Work on institutional buildings including schools and
hospitals plunged 44.5 percent to C$586 million. Industrial
permits fell 52.1 percent to C$320 million. Commercial projects
such as offices fell 11.8 percent to C$1.33 billion.  Permits for housing projects such as apartments and
condominiums rose 0.4 percent to C$4.24 billion.  Single-family housing permits rose 3.4 percent to C$2.50
billion, while multiple-unit projects fell for a third month in
September, by 3.8 percent to C$1.74 billion.  The agency also boosted the estimated value of permits for
August to C$7.46 billion from C$7.35 billion, further increasing
what had already been a record high. The percentage gain for
August was revised to 9.5 percent from 7.9 percent.  Even with the monthly September decline, the value of
permits remained 15.6 percent higher than the same month a year
earlier, Statistics Canada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
