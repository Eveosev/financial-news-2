Coffee-growing areas in  Brazil , the
largest producer of the bean, are suffering from irregular rain
and lower precipitation in recent weeks, which may harm
production, weather consultant Somar Meteorologia said.  For the next week, the pattern should be the same, with
low-intensity and irregular rains, said Somar in an e-mailed
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
