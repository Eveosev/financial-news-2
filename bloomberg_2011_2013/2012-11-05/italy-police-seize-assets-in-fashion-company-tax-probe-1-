Italy ’s finance police seized assets
worth 65 million euros ($83 million) in a tax probe linked to
the Marzotto family’s sale of Valentino Fashion Group in 2007.  The seizure is connected to an alleged evasion of taxes on
200 million euros in capital gains from the sale of company
stakes in 2007, according to an e-mailed statement by the Milan
finance police. The allegations are “unfounded,” the
Marzottos’ lawyers Nicolo Ghedini and Piero Longo said in a
statement.  The Marzotto family sold Valentino Fashion Group and its
 Hugo Boss AG (BOSS)  subsidiary to private-equity firm Permira Advisers
LLP in 2007. Permira sold Valentino to Mayhoola for Investments
SPC, a company backed by unidentified Qatari investors, in July.  The seized assets include real estate and stakes in
companies, the police said, without identifying those involved.  The  capital gains  were regularly declared and taxed within
the European Union, especially in Italy, the lawyers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
