Michelin today named 251 restaurants
in the Benelux region serving good-value, quality food.  The list of dining establishments includes 138 in  Belgium ,
eight in Luxembourg and 105 in the Netherlands. The French guide
selects places where a three-course meal costs no more than 35
euros ($44.80) or 36 euros in large towns and cities.  “In Belgium, international cuisine is especially
popular,” Michelin said today in e-mailed release. The list
includes 48 new entries and appears before the full Belgium and
Luxembourg guide on Nov. 19 and the Netherlands on Nov. 26.  Bib Gourmand winners include La Brasserie de Bruxelles, La
Brasserie de la Villa, Kokuban, De Maurice a Olivier and Mazaj
in Brussels; and La Sirene, Tempo Doeloe and Van Vlaanderen in
Amsterdam.  Michelin & Cie (ML) , the world’s second-biggest tiremaker,
produced its first guide in 1900. It was free of charge until
1920 and intended for chauffeurs. The volume contained practical
information, including street maps and tips on repairing tires.
The company is based in Clermont-Ferrand, France.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
