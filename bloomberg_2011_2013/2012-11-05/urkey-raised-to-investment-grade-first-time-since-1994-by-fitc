Turkey received its first investment-
grade ranking since 1994 after  Fitch Ratings  raised the country
by one level, citing an easing in economic risk and lower debt.
Stocks and bonds rallied to record levels.  Fitch boosted Turkey’s foreign-currency ranking to BBB-from
BB+, with a stable outlook, according to a statement today.
Turkish  yields  extended the biggest drop in  emerging markets 
this year, with the rate on benchmark two-year lira notes
touching an all-time low of 6.8 percent. The benchmark ISE
National 100  Index (XU100)  reached its highest on record.  The upgrade “reflects a combination of an easing in near-
term macro-financial risks as the economy heads for a soft
landing,” Fitch Managing Director  Ed Parker  in  London  wrote.
“The Turkish economy is on track to return to a sustainable
growth rate, having narrowed the current account deficit.”  Turkey’s current account gap narrowed for a 10th straight
month in October to the least since 2009 as exports to the
 Middle East  and  Africa  made up for lost sales to Europe and
slowing growth cut demand for imported goods. Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government cut debt to 36.5 percent of
gross domestic product this year from 74 percent in 2004.  The lira strengthened 0.6 percent against the dollar to
1.7818 as of 5:03 p.m. in Istanbul.  The benchmark stock  index
last traded 1.8 percent higher at 72,724.19, after climbing as
much as 2.7 percent to the highest intraday level since at least
1988. The two-year lira bond yields fell 11 basis points to 6.94
percent.  ‘Brave Step’  “Finally Fitch took the brave step, which might be a good
example for other rating agencies as well,”  Tevfik Aksoy ,
Morgan Stanley’s chief economist for central & eastern Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, said in e-mailed comments from
London. ‘The positive impact of the move will be gradual and
improve the overall quality of Turkey’s financing.’’  Turkey’s economy is “decelerating toward a soft landing”
after expanding by 8.5 percent in 2011 and 9.2 percent in 2010,
the  International Monetary Fund  said in a statement on June 8.
The inflation rate retreated to 7.8 percent in October from a
three-year high of 11.1 percent in April.  The government cut its  budget deficit  to 1.3 percent in
2011 from 11.9 percent in 2001. Turkey expects the gap to rise
to 2.3 percent for this year, above the 1.5 percent it
anticipated a year ago. The government forecasts a shortfall of
2.2 percent next year.  Moody’s Investors Service raised Turkey to Ba1 on June 20,
one level below investment grade and three below  Russia , citing
a “significant” improvement in public finances and policies.
Greater resilience to external shocks is a prerequisite for
raising it to investment grade, Moody’s said in an e-mailed
statement on Oct. 30.  Deficit  Standard & Poor’s  cut its outlook on Turkey’s debt to
stable from positive on May 1, maintaining its BB rating, two
steps below investment grade. Erdogan said at a conference in
Istanbul two days later that the “strange” and “ideological”
decision didn’t reflect economic reality.  S&P ranked Turkey investment grade until 1994.  A year ago, Fitch cut Turkey’s long-term foreign-currency
rating outlook to stable from positive because of the country’s
current-account deficit at 10 percent of GDP, the second-highest
in the world after the U.S. Investor concern caused the lira to
depreciate 18 percent in 2011, the biggest currency slump among
emerging markets worldwide.  Central bank governor Erdem Basci responded by introducing
a flexible interest-rates policy in October 2011. He varied the
lenders’ borrowing costs daily within a corridor bound by 5.75
percent at the lower end and 12.5 percent at the upper to stem
the lira’s free-fall and narrow the current-account gap by
reining in credit growth.  Unconventional  Economic growth in Turkey slowed to 2.9 percent in the
second quarter from 9.1 percent a year earlier. That’s below the
average annual growth rate of 5.5 percent since 2002, when
Erdogan’s  Justice and Development Party  took power. To combat
slowing growth, Basci cut the top-end of his rates band in
September and October, bringing it down to 9.5 percent.  “Turkey has shown that it can navigate with the challenges
it had -- both inflation and the current account,” Aurelija Augulyte, a strategist at Nordea Bank in Copenhagen, said in e-
mailed comments. “The unconventional monetary policy worked out
well, even though the markets were skeptical at the beginning.”  Iran Exports  Turkey’s gold exports to  Iran  helped narrow the trade
deficit to $6.8 billion in September from a record $10.5 billion
a year earlier, the statistics office said on its website Oct.
31. Imports fell 6.4 percent to $19.8 billion and exports rose
21 percent to $13 billion led by precious metal exports in
September. The  trade gap  is the largest component of the
nation’s current-account gap.  The cost to insure Turkey’s bonds against non-payment using
credit-default swaps dropped two basis points to 161, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with 157 basis points
for Russia, which is rated a level higher at BBB by Fitch,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The extra yield on Turkey’s dollar bonds over U.S.
Treasuries has slid to 205 basis points, less than the 315
basis-point spread for investment-grade  Croatia , 320 for Romania
and 237 for  Kazakhstan , JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
