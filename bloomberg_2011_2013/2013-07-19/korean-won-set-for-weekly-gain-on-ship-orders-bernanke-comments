The won was poised for a weekly gain
after a major South Korean shipbuilder won an overseas order and
as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  calmed concern the
monetary authority will scale back its stimulus.  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. received a
665.3 billion won ($593 million) drillship contract, the company
said in a regulatory filing today. Ship deliveries, which as
recently as 2011 were  South Korea ’s biggest exports, increased
last month for the first time in a year amid a resurgence in
global trade. It is “way too early to make any judgment” on
starting tapering in September, Bernanke told lawmakers
yesterday, a month after indicating that the monetary authority
may start cutting the bond-buying program this year.  “There is speculation exporters sold dollars from the
overseas deals, which must have boosted the won,” said Han Sung Min, a currency trader at Busan Bank in  Seoul .  The won rose 0.2 percent this week and 0.3 percent today to
1,125.48 per dollar as of 11:35 a.m. in Seoul, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
31 basis points, or 0.31 percentage point, to 8.15 percent.  Group of 20 nations must coordinate efforts to tackle an
end to the Fed’s stimulus, South Korean Finance Minister Hyun Oh
Seok said yesterday in Moscow before a meeting of G-20 finance
chiefs and central bankers starts today.  The yield on the 2.75 percent government notes due June
2016 fell four basis points to 2.85 percent this week, according
to Korea Exchange Inc. prices. It declined one basis point
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
