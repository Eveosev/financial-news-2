South Africa  will probably cut its
economic growth forecast for this year to as low as 2 percent as
mining strikes and a recession in  Europe  curb exports, Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  Africa’s largest  economy  may expand 2 percent to 2.2
percent in 2013, lower than a February estimate of 2.7 percent
and down from 2.5 percent expansion last year, Gordhan said in
an interview with Bloomberg TV in Moscow today.  “Growth is likely to be lower,” he said. “We will have
to accommodate our spending patterns in line with what our
revenue picture shows.”  The government is limiting spending for the next three
years as strikes in the  mining industry  and slumping demand from
Europe for manufactured exports reduces revenue. Gordhan pledged
in his February budget to narrow the fiscal deficit to 4.6
percent of gross domestic product in the year through March 2014
from an estimated 5.2 percent last year.  The Reserve Bank yesterday cut its GDP growth forecast to 2
percent from 2.4 percent and kept its benchmark lending rate at
5 percent, the lowest level more than 30 years. The rand has
weakened 14 percent against the dollar this year, threatening to
boost inflation. The currency gained 0.4 percent to 9.8944 per
dollar by 10:45 a.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
