Chinese  stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to its biggest weekly decline this month, amid
concern the economic slowdown will hurt earnings and that more
cities will take steps to limit property-price increases.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048) ,  China ’s second-largest
developer by market value, sank the most in almost four weeks
after a Guangzhou newspaper reported the city is studying
property curbs. Kweichow Moutai Co., the nation’s biggest liquor
maker by market value, dropped to an 11-week low.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 1.5 percent to 1,992.65
at the close, taking its decline this week to 2.3 percent. The
gauge lost 12 percent in 2013 as the economy slowed and money-market rates reached record highs. While China Central
Television reported Premier Li Keqiang as saying the government
can achieve major economic development goals this year, the
official Xinhua News Agency said yesterday the nation faces a
complex “external environment” in the second half of the year.  “What the government is signaling is that the economy is
in good shape at least for the year,” said Dai Ming, a money
manager who helps oversee $19 million at Hengsheng Hongding
Asset Management Co. “But the market is concerned that the
government has fewer tools now to stabilize the economy than
before. Volatile sentiment will dominate the market.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
