Renewable Energy Systems Ltd., a
U.K. developer that’s built more than 100 wind farms worldwide,
agreed to construct a 200-megawatt project for  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) 
in  Minnesota .  Construction on the Pleasant Valley Wind Farm will begin in
mid-2014 and is expected to be complete the following year, the
company’s Broomfield, Colorado-based RES Americas unit said
today in a statement. Xcel will assume ownership when it goes
into operation.  The project near Austin, Minnesota, about 100 miles (160
kilometers) south of Minneapolis, is adjacent to Xcel’s 100-megawatt  Grand Meadow  project and is part of about 600 megawatts
of wind capacity Xcel is planning in the upper Midwest.  “Wind power is simply the cheapest resource available
right now, and we are taking the opportunity afforded by the PTC
extension to further shape our systems for the future,” Xcel
Chief Executive Officer Ben Fowke said in the statement,
referring to the production tax credit for power produced from
clean sources that was renewed for one year on Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
