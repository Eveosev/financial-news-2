IMI Plc (IMI) , the U.K. manufacturer of
soda dispensers and air conditioning equipment, rose to the
highest in at least 25 years after  Citigroup Inc (C)  named it one of
its most preferred stocks.  ’’We see further significant margin upside at IMI, driven
by both mix and restructuring. A strong balance sheet and yield
are both supportive, too,’’ said Mark Fielding, an analyst at
Citi, in a note to investors.  IMI remains vulnerable to U.S. consumer spending for its
beverage distribution and merchandising businesses, Fielding
said. Exchange-rate movements are another major risk for the
company, which has about 90 percent of its sales outside the
U.K.  IMI rose as much as 3.1 percent to 1,411 pence in  London ,
making it the top gainer today among FTSE 100 companies. The
shares have gained about 49 percent since IMI joined the
benchmark index in December 2010, Bloomberg data show.  The company offers a range of engineering services to
companies in more than 50 countries and merchandise displays for
retail stores.  IMI was founded by a Scottish Victorian entrepreneur in
Birmingham in 1862. Today, the company is involved in  energy
efficiency , fluid controls and marketing solutions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
