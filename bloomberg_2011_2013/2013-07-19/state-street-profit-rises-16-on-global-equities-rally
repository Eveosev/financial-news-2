State Street Corp. (STT) , the third-largest custody bank, said second-quarter profit climbed 16
percent as rising global equity markets lifted the value of the
assets it oversees.  Net income on an operating basis increased to $571 million,
or $1.24 a share, from $494 million, or $1.01, a year earlier,
the Boston-based company said today in a statement. Excluding
certain items, 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg  expected 
earnings of $1.18 a share on average.  State Street, led by Chief Executive Officer Joseph L. Hooley, has led a rally among the three largest independent U.S.
custody banks, gaining 49 percent this year through yesterday
amid aggressive efforts over the past two years to cut costs and
return capital to shareholders. State Street raised its  dividend 
twice in the past 16 months and increased the size of its share
repurchase program in March.  “It was a good quarter and I think it’s pretty impressive
what State Street has been able to do in terms of expense
control and capital management,” James Shanahan, an equity
analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis, said in a telephone
interview.  State Street declined 1.2 percent to $69.28 at 4:15 p.m. in
 New York  trading, while the Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  and the
S&P index of custody banks and asset managers both gained 0.2
percent.  Hooley said investor confidence has improved, even though
he expects “choppiness” in stock markets relating to how the
Federal Reserve signals and draws back on monetary stimulus.  Markets Healing  “I feel as good as I’ve felt at any point post-crisis,”
Hooley said in a telephone interview. “The world is healing and
developed markets, most notably the U.S., are getting back on
their feet.”  Assets under custody increased 15 percent from a year
earlier to $18.9 trillion, and the amount of money State Street
invests for clients rose 12 percent to $2.15 trillion. The S&P
500 Index of U.S. stocks rose 18 percent in the 12 months ended
June 30, and global stocks, as measured by the MSCI ACWI Index,
advanced 14 percent.  New business added $201 billion to custody assets and $11
billion to investing assets, excluding the  SPDR Gold Trust (GLD)  ETF,
during the three months ended June 30. Assets in SPDR Gold Trust
plunged by about $25 billion in the quarter amid a global gold
selloff.  Fees, Expenses  Fees for overseeing custody and investing assets rose 11
percent, helping to increase operating revenue by 4.9 percent to
$2.58 billion. Net interest revenue, hurt by low interest rates,
declined 7.5 percent to $582 million.  Expenses climbed 1.4 percent to $1.75 billion and
compensation and benefits dropped by 2.7 percent from a year
earlier, the company said in the statement.  State Street repurchased $560 million of common stock in
the quarter at an average price of $65.73. The company declared
a quarterly dividend of 26 cents a share.  “Right now I’m pretty comfortable and confident that the
best way to deploy excess capital is to buy back shares and
maintain the dividend.” Hooley said.  The company resolved its search for a chief financial
officer in June, naming Michael W. Bell, former CFO at Toronto-based insurer  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , to replace Edward Resch,
who plans to retire in August.  Custody Banks  Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the world’s largest custody
bank, said July 17 its second-quarter profit rose 79 percent to
$833 million, or 71 cents a share, a year after costs from a
legal settlement hurt earnings.  Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) , based in  Chicago , said July 17 its
net income climbed 6.2 percent to $187.9 million, or 78 cents a
share.  The company’s operating profit excludes money earned from
the sale or maturing of bonds whose value was written down in
May 2009, which the company records as “discount accretion”
within net interest income.  Net income based on generally accepted accounting
principles, or GAAP, increased 19 percent to $571 million, or
$1.24 a share, from $480 million, or 98 cents a share, a year
earlier.  Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend
securities for institutional investors including mutual funds,
pension funds and hedge funds. State Street also manages
investments for individuals and institutions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
