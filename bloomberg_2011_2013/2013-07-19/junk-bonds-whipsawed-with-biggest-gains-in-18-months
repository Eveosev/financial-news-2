Junk bonds , which posted the worst
loss in almost two years in June, are now staging a comeback
with the biggest gain in 18 months.  Dollar-denominated speculative-grade notes have returned
2.4 percent in July, following a 2.6 percent decline in June and
pushing this year’s advance to 3.9 percent, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index. Clear Channel
Communications Inc.’s $7.7 billion of bonds in the index have
surged 9.1 percent since plunging 10.9 percent from May 22 to
June 24, the data show. Steelmaker ArcelorMittal’s $14.1 billion
of notes are up 4.8 percent after dropping 7.6.  Buyers are clamoring for yields that reached the highest
levels since November after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  pledged
this week to “maintain a high degree of monetary
accommodation” when the central bank’s debt-purchasing slows.
The two biggest exchange-traded funds that focus on high-yield
debt have reported about $687 million of deposits this month
after investors yanked about $1.8 billion in June, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  “Yields became attractive enough that people started to
come back into the market,” said Marc Gross, a  money manager  at
RS Investments in  New York  who oversees about $3.5 billion in
fixed-income funds. “It’s been a pretty impressive rally.”  Bernanke Lulls  Bernanke is lulling bond buyers back into speculative-grade
securities by assuring them that no course has been set for
paring stimulus that has pumped $2.6 trillion into the financial
system since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in
2008. The Fed chairman helped trigger the selloff after telling
Congress on May 22 that sustainable labor-market progress could
prompt policy makers to scale back $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases in their next few meetings.  That sent yields on 10-year  U.S. Treasuries (USGG10YR)  surging,
reaching as high as 2.75 percent on July 8 from this year’s low
of 1.61 percent on May 1.  Junk-bond yields climbed to as high as 7.15 percent on June
25 from 6.04 on May 22 before dropping back to 6.51 percent as
of yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. The
extra yield investors demand to own the debt instead of similar-maturity Treasuries widened as much as 107 basis points during
the period to 534 basis points on June 24, before recouping more
than half of the loss in less than three weeks.  Bond Swings  The swing in high-yield bond returns since the end of May
is the biggest since the notes posted a 2.21 percent loss in
November 2011 following a 5.96 percent monthly gain, the index
data show.  The securities, which have posted an average annual return
of 19.8 percent since the end of 2008, are returning 6.5
percentage points more than investment-grade debt in 2013, with
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  strategists predicting the higher-risk
notes will continue to outperform through year-end.  The $21.4 billion of HCA Holdings Inc. bonds in Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s junk index have climbed an average 5.1
percent since June 24 after the debt of the nation’s largest
for-profit hospital chain declined 6.5 percent in the five weeks
following Bernanke’s May 22 comments.  “We did view the selloff as a buying opportunity,” said
Eric Takaha, director of the corporate and high-yield group at
Franklin Templeton Investments in  San Mateo ,  California . “We
were buyers particularly of high yield after the dip in some of
our multi-sector fixed-income accounts.”  Credit Benchmarks  Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost to protect against
losses on corporate bonds in the U.S. fell for a third day to an
eight-week low. Investors added $1.8 billion this week into
funds that purchase leveraged loans in the U.S., an all-time
high, according to Bank of America.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, declined 0.8 basis point to a
mid-price of 73.8 basis points as of 12:37 p.m. in New York, the
least since May 23, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  In  London , the  Markit iTraxx Europe Index , tied to 125
companies with investment-grade ratings, dropped 1.1 to 100.7.  The indexes typically fall as investor confidence improves
and rise as it deteriorates. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  TWC Bonds  Bonds of New York-based  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  are the most
actively traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by
dealers today, accounting for 4 percent of the volume of dealer
trades of $1 million or more, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Time Warner Cable’s $1 billion of 4 percent notes due in
September 2021 dropped the most since they were issued in 2011
after  Bloomberg News  reported that Charter Communications Inc.,
backed by billionaire  John Malone , is working with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. to pursue a bid for the pay-TV system. The notes fell
3.2 cents to 92.9 cents on the dollar to yield 5.07 percent,
Trace data show.  The loan-fund increase brought deposits this year to about
$38 billion, an almost 50 percent rise in assets,  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based Bank of America said in a report yesterday.
U.S. speculative-grade bond funds reported an inflow of $2.8
billion, the most since October 2011.  ‘Many Overreacted’  Funds that invest in senior-ranking bank debt have gained
every single week this year, returning  3.1 percent ,  Standard &
Poor’s /LSTA index data show. Prices on the largest, first lien
floating-rate borrowings rose to 98.26 cents on the dollar, the
most since May 31.  Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3
by Moody’s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at S&P.  July gains in junk bonds are the most since the debt
returned 2.9 percent in January 2012, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data show. Even with June’s loss, the 3.9 percent
return this year compares with a 2013 decline of 2.6 percent for
investment-grade bonds in the U.S. Yields on the notes have
dropped to 6.51 percent, or 53 basis points above the all-time
low reached May 9, after rising to 7.15 percent on June 25.  “Many overreacted in the short term,” said David Breazzano, president of DDJ Capital Management LLC, which
oversees more than $6 billion in assets ranked below investment
grade. “High yield is relatively attractive as a fixed-income
investment.”  ‘Bullish’ Environment  The trailing 12-month global speculative-grade default rate
fell to 2.8 percent at the end of the second quarter from 3.1
percent in the same period last year, according to Moody’s. In
the U.S., the high-yield default rate dropped to 2.9 percent
from 3.3 percent a year earlier.  Investors have been pushed into the higher-risk assets as
the Fed, along with its debt purchases, holds benchmark
borrowing costs at about zero for a fifth year. The central bank
is seeking to ignite economic growth and reduce a U.S.
unemployment rate that swelled to as high as 10 percent in
October 2009. The jobless rate has since shrunk to 7.6 percent
through June. Yields on 10-year Treasuries ended yesterday at
2.53 percent, up from 1.76 percent at year-end.  “A rising interest-rate environment due to an improving
economy is very bullish for high-yield credit spreads,” Bank of
America credit strategist Hans Mikkelsen wrote in a July 17
report. “When the risk of further rapid increases in interest
rates declines, as we have seen post-payrolls, high-yield total
returns can quickly recover and attract inflows.”  ‘Significant Factor’  Investor demand this month spurred the creation of 6.2
million of  new shares , or about $569 million, in BlackRock
Inc.’s $14.7 billion  iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond
ETF , the biggest of its kind, Bloomberg data show.  State Street Corp.’s $9.7 billion  SPDR Barclays High Yield
Bond ETF (JNK) , the second-biggest, has reported about 3 million
shares created since June. That’s equal to about $119 million.
About $1.8 billion of shares were yanked from the two funds in
June.  “ETFs are a significant factor for the high-yield
market,” DDJ Capital’s Breazzano said. “Ten years ago that
wasn’t the case. When you get emotional retail investors making
some dramatic changes, it can create some short-term
volatility.”  The price of Clear Channel’s $1.75 billion of 9 percent
bonds due in March 2021 rose to 101 cents on the dollar
yesterday from as low as 92.5 cents on June 24, Trace data show.
The yield fell to 8.8 percent from 10.4 percent. ArcelorMittal’s
$1.1 billion of 6.25 percent notes have risen to 105.25 cents
from 100.25 cents on June 24, with the yield falling to 6
percent from 6.7 percent.  “Even following the better performance in July, we still
think valuations are reasonable,” Franklin’s Takaha said. “You
can see these technicals occur again and again, and if you have
a longer-term investment horizon, you can look to take advantage
of them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
