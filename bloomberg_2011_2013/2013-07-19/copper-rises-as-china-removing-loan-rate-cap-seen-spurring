Copper rose for a second straight
day after  China  took steps to give banks more freedom to set
borrowing costs, a sign that the government wants to spur
economic growth in the world’s biggest metal-consuming country.  The People’s Bank of China said today it will remove the
floor on lending rates offered by financial institutions and
rural cooperatives. The central bank’s one-year benchmark rate
has been held at 6 percent since the last reduction in July
2012. Copper prices were down 14 percent this year through
yesterday on signs of slowing growth in China.  “There’s been a lot of bad economic news coming out of
China, and this gives the markets something to be optimistic
about,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options
in Port  St. Lucie,  Florida , said in a telephone interview.
“China is always the thing that moves copper markets, and this
sort of stimulus will be considered a positive.”  Copper futures for delivery in September gained 0.4 percent
to $3.144 a pound by 8:50 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices
through yesterday fell 0.7 percent this week.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed 0.4 percent to $6,934.50 a metric ton ($3.15 a
pound).  Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also were higher in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
