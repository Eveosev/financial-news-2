It was an epic “whodunit” in the
publishing world. Who was the enigmatic tweeter who led to the
disclosure that J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter
series, had penned the pseudonymous mystery novel “The Cuckoo’s
Calling”?  Yesterday,  London  law firm Russells confirmed that the
closely guarded secret was accidentally revealed by one of its
lawyers, Chris Gossage, who represents Rowling.  According to the firm, Gossage had confidentially told his
wife’s best friend, who in turn tweeted the news to a reviewer
at the Sunday Times.  Russells yesterday released a statement apologizing
“unreservedly for the disclosure caused by one of our
partners.” The firm said that the “leak was not part of any
marketing plan and that neither Rowling, her agent nor her
publisher were in any way involved.”  Rowling then released a statement of her own: “To say that
I am disappointed is an understatement. I had assumed that I
could expect total confidentiality from Russells, a reputable
professional firm and I feel very angry that my trust turned out
to be misplaced.”  Since the disclosure, sales of the book have skyrocketed;
publisher Little Brown was reported by the New York Times to be
printing 300,000 more books to meet demand. A Little Brown
spokesman, Mark Hutchinson, declined to comment yesterday by e-mail.  In the Courts  Silverstein Denied Right to Seek $3.5 Billion From Airlines  Real estate developer Larry Silverstein can’t seek $3.5
billion from airlines whose planes were hijacked by terrorists
and flown into the World Trade Center’s twin towers on Sept. 11,
2001, a federal judge ruled.  Silverstein, who leased the skyscrapers about two months
before they were destroyed, already collected $4.1 billion from
insurers and can’t collect twice under New York law, U.S.
District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein ruled yesterday in a
courtroom less than a mile and a half from the World Trade
Center site.  Silverstein’s World Trade Center Properties LLC in 2008
sued  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) , American Airlines and its
parent  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) , claiming their negligence led to the
destruction of the towers.  The company, which rebuilt the destroyed 7 World Trade
Center and is rebuilding three other towers on the site, argued
that the insurance accord didn’t bar it from seeking additional
damages in civil cases because the payout didn’t correspond to
specific types of economic losses, such as replacement costs for
the buildings or lost rent from tenants. Hellerstein disagreed.  “There’s complete correspondence,” Hellerstein said. When
such a link is made between an insurance payout and a specific
type of loss, collecting on that same type of loss is barred
under New York law, he said.  “We did not believe that the plaintiff could be permitted
any further compensation and we are pleased the judge ruled in
our favor,” Christen David, a spokeswoman for United, said in
an e-mail.  “We are gratified by the judge’s decision,” Mike Trevino,
an American Airlines spokesman, said in a statement.  “We are deeply disappointed in today’s decision,”  Bud Perrone , a spokesman for Silverstein Properties, said in a
statement. “While we respect Judge Hellerstein, we believe his
ruling on this issue, and on prior issues, to be in error and
intend to file an immediate appeal. We will not rest until we
have exhausted every option to assure that the aviation
industry’s insurers pay their fair share toward the complete
rebuilding of the World Trade Center.”  The case is In Re September 11 Litigation, 21-mc-00101,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  For more, click here.  Diller’s Vimeo Seeks to End Vivendi Music Copyright Lawsuit  Vimeo, the video-sharing website owned by Barry Diller’s
 IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI) , says federal law protects it against a
 Vivendi SA (VIV)  copyright lawsuit over music that includes recordings
by the Beatles and the Beach Boys.  U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams heard arguments yesterday
on Vimeo’s motion to dismiss the case.  Vivendi labels including Capitol Records sued Vimeo in 2009
claiming that  the website  “induces and encourages its users to
upload” copyrighted videos and songs it wasn’t authorized to
display. The songs include the Beatles’ “Let It Be,” the Beach
Boys’ “Surfin’ USA” and Radiohead’s “High and Dry.” Users
post homemade videos in which they lip-synch to the infringed
songs, the labels said in the complaint.  Vimeo, based in New York, denied infringing copyrights and
said that it’s protected by the safe-harbor provision of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA. The safe-harbor rule
applies if a site removes infringing material when informed
about it.  “Whenever they sent us a DMCA notice we took down the
video expeditiously,” Robert Raskopf, a lawyer for Vimeo with
Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, told the judge. “This is
an ambush. No DMCA ever came. They just filed.”  Vimeo, which has more than 14 million registered users,
gets its revenue from subscription fees and advertising.  The labels said that Vimeo can’t be protected by law
because it knew that the uploaded videos contained unlicensed
copyrighted material and that it benefited financially from
them.  “Vimeo knew it wasn’t licensed; they talked about getting
licenses but didn’t want to spend the money,” Russell Frackman,
a lawyer for the labels with Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp LLP,
said to the judge. “They get paid directly from advertising
pages that have our material.”  The labels asked the judge to deny Vimeo’s motion and grant
them partial summary judgment. If Abrams rejects the motions,
the case may go to trial by jury.  Other lawyers from Quinn Emanuel working on the case
includes partner Rachel Herrick Kassabian and of counsel Jessica
Rose.  The case is Capitol Records LLC v. Vimeo LLC, 1:09-cv-10101, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
( Manhattan ).  For more, click here.  Deals  Willkie Farr, Kaye Scholer on Men’s Wearhouse Acquisition  Men’s Wearhouse Inc. (MW) , the menswear retailer that ousted its
founder last month, agreed to buy the Joseph Abboud clothing
brand for $97.5 million in cash as the chain seeks to offer
exclusive brands.  Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP represented the retailer,
while Kaye Scholer LLP represented private-equity firm J.W.
Childs Associates LP, the owner of the brand, JA Holding Inc.  Willkie partners Steven Seidman and Laura Delanoy worked on
the deal. Seidman led the Willkie team that advised the Men’s
Wearhouse board of directors when they fired founder George Zimmer as executive chairman over strategy disagreements on June
19.  From Kaye Scholer representing J.W. Childs are partners
Stephen Koval, Laurie Abramowitz and Jeff London.  The purchase reunites Men’s Wearhouse Chief Creative
Director Joseph Abboud with the brand he created and gives the
retailer an exclusive label to sell through its more than 1,100
stores.  The acquisition also includes JA Holding’s U.S. tailored
clothing factory that employs 450 workers. The deal is expected
to be completed in the third quarter, Houston-based Men’s
Wearhouse said yesterday in a statement.  For more, click here.  Law Firm Moves  Orrick Herrington Hires White Collar Lawyer for New York Office  Guy Singer joined Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP as a
