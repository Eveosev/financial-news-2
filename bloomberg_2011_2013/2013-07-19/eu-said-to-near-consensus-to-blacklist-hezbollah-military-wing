A consensus began to take shape in
the European Union to label the military wing of Hezbollah a
terrorist organization, an EU official said.  While no preliminary agreement has yet been reached, “only
a few” EU member states are waiting until July 22 to finalize
their position, said the official, who spoke to reporters in
Brussels today on condition of anonymity.  EU foreign ministers will debate the issue on Monday, with
28-nation unanimity needed for a decision. A decision isn’t
guaranteed and last-minute objections by Lebanon’s government
may affect the debate, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
