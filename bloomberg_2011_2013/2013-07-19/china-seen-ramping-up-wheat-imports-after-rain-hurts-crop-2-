China  may boost wheat purchases from
Australia by 67 percent this year, said grain handler Emerald 
Group Australia Pty, adding to signs that imports by the largest
user will jump after rains hurt domestic crops. Prices advanced.  Shipments may reach 2 million metric tons in the 12 months
started July 1 compared with about 1.2 million tons a year
earlier, Brian Dalitz, general manager of trading and marketing
at the Melbourne-based company, said in an interview.  Increased buying may help to absorb record global supplies
and support prices in  Chicago  that have tumbled into a bear
market. China may more than double imports to 8.5 million tons
in 2013-14, the highest since 1995-96, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates. That would rank the country second among
buyers after  Egypt , compared with 16th the previous season, and
offer opportunities for shippers from Australia to  Russia .  “There’s likely going to be more demand for milling-quality wheat into China this year,” said Graydon Chong, a
grains and oilseed analyst at Rabobank International in Sydney.
“We certainly will see competition.”  Wheat for September delivery gained as much as 0.9 percent
to $6.6675 a bushel today on the Chicago Board of Trade, and was
at $6.625 by 4:51 a.m. local time. Most-active prices in Chicago
have lost 29 percent over the past year, and touched the lowest
since June 2012 this month. By contrast, futures on the
Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange touched a two-year high this week.  Excess Rain  Wheat yields and quality in Henan, Hubei, Anhui and
Shandong were hurt by excess rain in May and June, the USDA’s
Foreign Agricultural Service said in a report posted on its
website July 3. Heavy rain caused newly matured wheat to
germinate in parts of provinces including Henan and Shandong,
the top two growers, which hurt output, the China National Grain
& Oils Information Center said last month.  China’s imports of Australian wheat and flour climbed to
1.9 million tons in the year ended June 30, 2012, from 530,000
tons a year earlier, according to the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences.  Indonesia  is
typically the biggest buyer of Australian wheat.  “China  bought  quite a bit of wheat from Australia last
year, with a lot of it used as feed wheat, and this year it’ll
probably buy more if Australian crops turn out cheap,” Zhang
Zhixian, an analyst at Cngrain.com, said from Zhengzhou.  Global Production  The global wheat harvest will climb 6.5 percent to 697.8
million tons in 2013-14, the highest ever, on bigger harvests in
Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and the European Union, according to
the USDA, which sees China’s crop unchanged at 121 million tons.
Production in Australia, the world’s third-biggest exporter in
2012-13, will increase 15 percent to 25.4 million tons in
2013-14, the Australian government forecaster says.  “If we do have a large crop year in  Australia , there’ll be
more exports going out, and we think that China makes up a
fairly sizeable chunk of that,” Rabobank’s Chong said by phone
today. “We are expecting larger crops out of the U.S. and the
Black Sea crops are already proving to be very cheap.”  From June 1 to July 11, combined sales and shipments of
U.S. wheat to China were 3.3 million tons, according to USDA
data. Total U.S. wheat exports will increase 6.5 percent to 29.3
million tons in 2013-14, according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
