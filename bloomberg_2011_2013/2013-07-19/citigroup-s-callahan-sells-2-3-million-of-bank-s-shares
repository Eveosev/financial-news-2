Don Callahan, the  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
executive whose duties were reduced by Chief Executive Officer
 Michael Corbat  this year, sold about $2.3 million of the bank’s
shares yesterday after they almost doubled in the past year.  Callahan, the former chief administrative officer, sold
45,000 shares for $52.14 each, according to a regulatory filing
today. He still has 252,238 shares of the New York-based bank,
worth $13.2 million at today’s $52.35 closing price, the filing
shows. The stock is up  97 percent  over the last 12 months.  Corbat removed some of Callahan’s duties as part of a
shake-up in January, soon after he replaced  Vikram Pandit  as CEO
in October. Callahan, whom Pandit had promoted to chief
administrative officer, lost direct oversight of expense
management along with control of the operations and technologies
that support consumer and investment banking.  Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to
comment. Callahan didn’t immediately respond to phone and e-mail
requests for comment.  Callahan sold the stock three days after Citigroup, the
third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported a 42 percent
increase in second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
