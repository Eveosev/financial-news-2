Radius Christanto, an Indonesian
businessman accused by  Australia  of conspiring with its central
bank’s note printing units to bribe foreign public officials,
won’t challenge his extradition, a Singapore court was told.  Christanto, 64, wants to go to Australia as soon as
possible and isn’t suitable for regular prison while in custody
awaiting transfer, his lawyer Hamidul Haq said today. Singapore
District Court Judge Mathew Joseph extended Christanto’s bail
and said he would decide on his custody conditions on July 25.  Christanto, who has lived in Singapore since 1989, faces
two charges in Australia for his role in a conspiracy with
Securency International Pty and Note Printing Australia Ltd, to
bribe an unidentified foreign public official from December 1999
to February 2001.  At least nine former managers and employees at the
Australian central bank note-printing unit and Securency were
charged in relation to the bribing of officials in  Malaysia ,
 Indonesia , Nepal and  Vietnam  from 1999 to 2004 to win banknote
printing contracts. The Reserve Bank of Australia in February
agreed to sell its 50 percent stake in Securency.  Under Australian laws, a person convicted of bribing a
foreign public official may be jailed for as long as 10 years.  Christanto had seven properties worth about S$25 million
($19.7 million) and S$15 million in cash in Singapore banks, 
according to a May 2012 ruling releasing him on  bail  of S$2 
million. He is in poor health and suffers from a “myriad of heart
ailments,” according to the decision.  The Singapore case is Public Prosecutor v Christanto Radius
