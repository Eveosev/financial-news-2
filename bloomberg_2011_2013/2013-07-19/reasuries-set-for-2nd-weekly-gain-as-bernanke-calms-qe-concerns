Treasuries posted the biggest two-week gain in almost a year after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  quelled concern that a reduction of monetary stimulus
was imminent.  Ten-year yields  fell from the 2013 high reached earlier
this month after Bernanke said yesterday it was “way too early
to make any judgment” about starting tapering in September. The
previous day, he said the Fed’s quantitative easing is “by no
means on a preset course.” Policy makers, who have kept the
benchmark  interest-rate target  at zero to 0.25 percent since
2008, next meet July 30-31. The U.S. will sell $99 billion in
notes next week.  “The market’s been held in by Bernanke’s comments overall
-- they are going to be lower for longer and QE is going to be
data dependent,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of
Treasury trading in  New York  at CIBC World Markets Corp. “I
don’t see any big move in front of the supply. We’ll mark some
time around the 2.5 percent level on the 10-year.”  Treasury  10-year yields  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.48 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
Bloomberg Bond Trader data showed. The price of the 1.75 percent
note due in May 2023 rose 1/8, or $3.75 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 93 20/32.  The yield has slipped 10 basis points  this week , after
declining 16 basis points in the previous five days, the biggest
back-to-back drop since the period ended Aug. 31. It touched an
almost two-year high of 2.75 percent on July 8.  Fed Funds  “The time frame may be pushed back to the end of the year,
as opposed to September,”  Sean Murphy , a trader in New York at
Societe Generale SA, one of the 21 primary dealers that trade
with the Fed, said of tapering. “The dependency on the data
points going forward will be significant.”  The Fed bought $3.142 billion of Treasuries maturing
between August 2020 and November 2022 today as part of its $85
billion in monthly purchases of  U.S. debt  and mortgage-backed
securities to put downward pressure on borrowing costs.  Investors see a 40 percent chance policy makers will lift
the federal funds rate to 0.5 percent or higher by December
2014, compared with 49 percent odds a week ago, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Bernanke said tighter financial conditions as a result of
rising yields over the past two months are “unwelcome,” in
response to a question from the Senate Banking Committee
following his testimony yesterday.  Yield Forecasts  The benchmark 10-year yield surged 81 basis points from the
close on May 21, the day before Bernanke said the Fed could trim
stimulus in its “next few meetings,” to the close on July 5
after a report that day showed U.S. employers added more jobs
than forecast in June.  “We continue to see modest downside potential for yields
over the next few weeks, reinforcing our near-term bullish bias
for Treasuries,”  Millan Mulraine , a director of U.S. rates
research at TD Securities USA LLC in New York, wrote in an e-mail. “However, as evidence of a more sustained economic
rebound begins taking shape later this quarter, we expect the
slow normalization in rates to begin in earnest, taking 10-year
yields back to 2.60 percent by year-end.”  The yield on the 10-year note is forecast to end the year
at 2.63 percent, according to the weighted average forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  Net Longs  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
from a net-short position to a  net-long position  in 10-year note
futures in the week ending July 16, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data. Speculative long positions, or
bets prices will rise, outnumbered short positions by 17,735
contracts, the most since July 1. Last week, traders were net-short 47,110 contracts.  Benchmark yields have risen this year as economic
indicators signaled improvement in sectors including housing,
employment and manufacturing.  Purchases (ETSLTOTL)  of previously owned homes rose last month to a
5.25 million annualized rate, which would be the most since
November 2009, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before the National Association of
Realtors’ report on July 22.  The Commerce Department will say on July 24 that sales of
 new homes  climbed in June to an annualized pace of 484,000 from
a 476,000 rate the previous month, a separate survey showed.
That would be the most since June 2008.  The Treasury Department will auction $35 billion of two-year debt, $35 billion of five-year notes and $29 billion of
seven-year securities on consecutive days starting on July 23.  The Treasury yesterday sold 10-year inflation-protected
securities with a  positive yield  for the first time in almost
two years.  The $15 billion of 10-year TIPS were auctioned at a yield
of 0.384 percent, the highest since July 2011 and first above
zero since November of that year. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.44, versus the 2.68 average for the
past 10 auctions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
