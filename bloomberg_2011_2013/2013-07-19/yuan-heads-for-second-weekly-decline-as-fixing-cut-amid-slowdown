China ’s  yuan  strengthened, erasing a
weekly loss, on speculation that the government will widen the
currency’s trading band.  The yuan’s trading band should be widened and capital-account convertibility accelerated, according to a front-page
commentary in the China Securities Journal.  Capital Economics  is
“deeply sceptical” of the view that the yuan has to weaken to
reach its market value, economists  Mark Williams  and Qinwei Wang
wrote in a note, saying the currency will rise to 6.1 per dollar
by the end of 2013 and climb further to 6 at end-2014.  “The authorities are committed to moving to a more market-based exchange rate, including a further widening of the
exchange-rate band,”  Tim Condon , head of Asian research at ING
Groep NV in Singapore, wrote in a report today.  The yuan rose 0.06 percent to 6.1379 per dollar in
Shanghai, trimming this week’s loss to 0.01 percent, China
Foreign Exchange Trade System prices show. That followed a drop
of 0.08 percent the previous week. The currency has strengthened
1.5 percent this year, making it the only gainer in Asia.  PBOC Fixing  The People’s Bank of China cut its yuan  reference rate  on
four of five days this week, lowering it to 6.1751 per dollar
today, 0.2 percent less than on July 12. The spot rate is
allowed to diverge a maximum 1 percent from the fixing.  The  International Monetary Fund  said July 17 there is an
increasing risk that China’s 2013 economic growth will fall
short of the fund’s 7.75 percent forecast. Asia’s largest
economy expanded 7.5 percent in the second quarter from a year
earlier, official data showed this week, slowing from a 7.7
percent gain in the preceding three months and 7.9 percent in
the final quarter of 2012.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.07 percent
today and this week to 6.1358 per dollar, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards advanced
0.04 percent today and 0.18 percent this week to 6.2775, a 2.2
percent  discount  to the onshore spot rate.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped 14 basis points this week and rose one basis point today
to 1.56 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
