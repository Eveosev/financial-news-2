China’s  interest-rate swaps  climbed
for a second week on speculation cash supply will drop as debt
maturities decline next week.  No central bank notes or  repurchase agreements  are due in
the five days starting July 22, after redemptions  added  160
billion  yuan  ($26 billion) to the financial system in the
current period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
People’s Bank of China refrained from selling bills and
conducting money-market operations this week.  “Liquidity may be a bit tight next week because of the
declining bill redemption,” said Song Qiuhong, a bond analyst
at Foshan Shunde Rural Commercial Bank Co. in Foshan, a city in
the southern province of Guangdong.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose five basis
points this week to 3.96 percent as of 10:31 a.m. in Shanghai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was unchanged today.  There is speculation that a “large” targeted injection of
funds by the central bank will expire on July 22,  Igor Arsenin 
and  Rohit Arora , Singapore-based strategist at Barclays Plc,
wrote in a research note yesterday.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, this week to 3.73 percent, according to a
weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It was steady today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
