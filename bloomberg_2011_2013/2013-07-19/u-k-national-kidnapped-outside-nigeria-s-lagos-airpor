A U.K. national was kidnapped this
week shortly after leaving the international airport in
Nigeria’s commercial capital Lagos, its diplomatic mission said.  The U.K. is working with local authorities to help secure
the captive’s release, Wale Adebayo, a spokesman for the British
High Commission, said by phone today from Lagos. He declined to
comment further.  Africa’s biggest oil producer has seen a renewed surge in
abductions targeting foreigners in the southern oil region,
Lagos and the mainly Muslim north, where Islamist militants have
taken more than a dozen foreigners hostage in the last two
years. Attacks by militant groups in the oil-rich Niger River
delta, which fell after thousands of fighters disarmed to accept
a government amnesty in 2008, are on the increase again.  Pirates operating in the Gulf of Guinea, off Nigeria’s
coast and nearby countries, kidnapped 30 crew in the first half
of this year, compared with three seized worldwide in the same
period a year earlier, the International Maritime Bureau in
 London  said in a report this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
