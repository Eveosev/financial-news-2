The following is the text of
 Canada ’s  consumer price index  report for June released
by  Statistics Canada .  The Consumer  Price Index  (CPI) rose 1.2% in the 12 months
to June, following a 0.7% increase in May. This 0.5 percentage
point gain in the CPI was led by transportation prices, which
rose 2.0% on a year-over-year basis in June after falling 0.5%
in May.  The acceleration in the transportation index was mostly
attributable to prices for gasoline and for the purchase of
passenger vehicles, both of which rose in the 12 months to June
after declining in May.  Compared with June last year, gasoline prices were up 4.6%.
This followed a 1.5% decrease in May. Gasoline prices increased
in the 12 months to June in all provinces, with Manitoba and
 Alberta  posting the largest gains.  Prices for the purchase of passenger vehicles rose 2.0% in
the 12 months to June, after declining 0.5% in May. The year-over-year increase in June was mainly attributable to smaller
monthly price declines in June 2013 compared with the same month
last year.  12-month change in the major components  Consumer prices rose in six of the eight major components
in the 12 months to June. The exceptions were health and
personal care as well as recreation, education and reading. In
addition to transportation, the shelter and food components led
the increase in the CPI in June.  Shelter costs rose 1.2% in the 12 months to June, after
increasing 1.3% in May. Natural gas prices and rent increased on
a year-over-year basis in June, while mortgage interest cost
decreased 3.8%.  Food prices increased 1.2% year over year in June,
following a 1.3% rise in May. Compared with June 2012, consumers
paid 1.3% more for food purchased from stores, as prices rose
for fresh vegetables (+5.1%) and meat (+2.2%). In contrast,
prices for sugar and confectionery declined 4.3%.  Consumers also paid 1.1% more for food purchased from
restaurants.  12-month change in the provinces  Consumer prices rose in nine provinces in the 12 months to
June, with the largest increase occurring in Manitoba. The
exception was British Columbia, where prices declined on a year-over-year basis.  In Manitoba, consumer prices increased 2.7% year over year
in June, following a 1.8% gain in May. Gasoline prices rose
10.7% in the 12 months to June, after advancing 0.9% in May.
Among the provinces, Manitoba posted the largest year-over-year
price increase for cigarettes and for passenger vehicle
registration fees.  Alberta’s CPI rose 2.3% on a year-over-year basis in June,
matching the increase in May. Gasoline prices advanced at a
faster rate in the 12 months to June (+9.2%) compared with May
(+1.6%). Conversely, smaller year-over-year price increases were
observed for natural gas in June relative to May.  Prices in British Columbia fell 0.5% in the 12 months to
June, after declining 0.6% in May. The province posted year-over-year price decreases for food purchased from restaurants
and homeowners’ replacement cost, while at the national level
these indexes increased. Additionally, gasoline prices rose 3.2%
year over year in June, after increasing 1.4% in May, a smaller
acceleration than at the national level.  Seasonally adjusted monthly Consumer Price Index increases  On a seasonally adjusted
