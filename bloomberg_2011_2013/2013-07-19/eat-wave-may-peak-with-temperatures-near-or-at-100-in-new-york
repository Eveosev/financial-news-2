Temperatures in New York City, where
electricity consumption hit an all-time high, will soar close to
100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) again today and humidity
will make the weather feel more like 110, which may spur
electricity consumption an all-time high for the state.  Yesterday, a new daily temperature record of 100 degrees
was set at John F. Kennedy International Airport, breaking the
mark of 96 set last year, according to the National Weather
Service. The temperature reached 101 at Newark Liberty airport,
100 at La Guardia airport and 98 at Central Park.  Those levels may be reached again today, said Lauren Nash,
a weather service meteorologist in Upton, New York.  “The big story today is going to be the excessive heat
warning,” Nash said by telephone. “The temperature could hit
101, 102 in some areas.”  Heat warnings and advisories are in place from  Maine  to
 Iowa  and across southern  Canada  as the heat wave enters its
sixth day in many places. The temperatures have spurred energy
demand as people in the high-population areas of the eastern
U.S. and Canada have turned to air conditioning to cool.  Electricity consumption in New York City hit a record
13,214 megawatts, enough for 10.5 million homes on an average
day, at 2 p.m., Chris Olert, a spokesman for utility
Consolidated Edison said today in a telephone interview. The
previous record was set July 22, 2011, he said.  State Record  New York’s grid operator forecast it may also set a
statewide record peak consumption today of 34,600 megawatts,
enough for more than 27 million homes on an average day,
according to U.S. Energy Department estimates. All available
power plants in the state are running, the New York Independent
System Operator Inc. said in a statement.  Actual consumption may be less because the grid operator
triggered conservation incentives that may curtail 1,200
megawatts, said Ken Klapp, a spokesman for the grid operator in
Rensselaer, New York. The state record for peak power use,
33,939 megawatts, was set Aug. 2, 2006.  PJM Interconnection LLC, operator of the largest U.S. high-voltage network, forecast peak electricity consumption will
decline 0.7 percent from yesterday’s use of 158,156 megawatts,
enough for 126.5 million homes on an average day.  Boston Heat  Today’s high temperature in  Boston  may reach 101, according
to the weather service. In Philadelphia, it may peak at 99; in
Washington 97; in Chicago 98; and 93 in  Detroit , according to
the weather service.  Toronto may reach 95 today and  Montreal  near 90, according
to Environment Canada.  “Today is the final and probably peak heat day for the
Eastern heat event with mid- to upper 90s widespread, but also
some 100 Fahrenheit hits again in spots like New York and
Boston,” said Matt Rogers, president of the Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland . “Rains increase this weekend
in the East with a cool front arrival.”  Environment Canada issued severe thunderstorm watches
across southern Ontario and  Quebec  as the cold front arrives.
Those storms are expected to move south into the U.S. tomorrow,
according to the Storm Prediction Center in Norman,  Oklahoma .  To contact the reporters on this story:
