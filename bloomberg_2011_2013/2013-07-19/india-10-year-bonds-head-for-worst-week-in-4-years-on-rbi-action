India ’s 10-year bonds headed for
their biggest weekly drop since March 2009 after the central
bank raised two  interest rates  to steady the nation’s currency.  The notes fell today before the  Reserve Bank  of India’s
scheduled sale of 150 billion rupees ($2.5 billion) of bonds,
with only 121.89 billion rupees underwritten. The RBI yesterday
sold 21 percent of its target in an open-market auction meant to
drain cash from the banking system. It rejected all bids at a
treasury-bill sale on July 17 after increasing the marginal
standing facility and the  bank rate  to 10.25 percent from 8.25
percent two days earlier. The key repurchase rate was unchanged.  “A devolvement is possible at the bond auction today,”
said Srinivasa Raghavan, Mumbai-based executive vice president
of treasury at Dhanalaxmi Bank Ltd., referring to when
underwriters have to take some of the notes. “The rupee’s
weakness is also pushing yields higher.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 rose six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.05 percent as of
10:24 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate has surged 52 basis points this week, the most
for a benchmark 10-year government note since March 2009, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The rupee fell 0.1 percent to 59.7687 per dollar in a third
day of losses today. A weaker currency makes imports costlier
and threatens to spur gains in  consumer prices , which have
stayed close to 10 percent for more than a year. RBI Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao left the repurchase  rate  unchanged at 7.25
percent at a June 17 policy meeting, citing inflation risks. The
rupee reached a record low of 61.2125 per dollar on July 8.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, jumped 111 basis
points to 8.65 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
rate climbed four basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
