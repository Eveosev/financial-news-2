The U.K. Parliamentâ€™s Business,
Innovation and Skills Committee will carry out an inquiry into
the proposed privatization of Royal Mail Group Ltd.  Business Secretary Vince Cable has been invited to testify
to the committee on the sale of shares in Royal Mail on Sept.
10, the panel said in an e-mailed statement today. The committee
also asked for written submissions by Aug. 30.  Cable announced on July 10 a plan to sell a majority stake
in the 360-year-old postal service in an initial public offering
by the end of March.  Ten percent of shares will go free to staff and retail
investors will be offered stock on the same terms as
institutional investors. The sale will be the largest U.K.
privatization since then Prime Minister  John Major  broke up
British Rail in the 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
