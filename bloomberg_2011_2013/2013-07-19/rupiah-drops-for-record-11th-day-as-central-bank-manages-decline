Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a record
11th day as the central bank manages a gradual depreciation of
the onshore  exchange rate  toward offshore levels.  Government
bonds  advanced.  The currency dropped by the most in two months today after
weakened beyond 10,000 per dollar for the first time since 2009
on July 15. Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo said
July 11 the monetary authority has supplied dollars to the
market in the past two to three months while allowing the rupiah
to slowly retreat. Foreign-exchange  reserves  dropped $7.1
billion in June, the most since September 2011, to total less
than $100 billion for the first time in more than two years.  “We expect pressure on the spot rate to continue,” said
Thio Chin Loo, senior currency analyst at BNP Paribas SA in
 Singapore . “ Bank Indonesia  is releasing its hold because
draining the reserves is uncomfortable for them, so this allows
pent-up dollar demand to go through.”  The rupiah declined 0.4 percent to 10,103 per dollar as of
1:15 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest drop since May 16, prices from
local banks show. The currency touched 10,126 earlier, the
weakest level since Sept. 7, 2009. The spot rate is still 3.2
percent stronger than one-month non-deliverable forwards, which
traded at 10,438. A  fixing  by the Association of Banks in
Singapore that is used to settle the contracts was set at 10,170.  The onshore spot rate fell 1.1 percent this week, compared
with a 2.6 percent slide in the forwards. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, dropped 53 basis points, or 0.53
percentage point, today to 13.36 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Currency Swap  The rupiah’s potential for the widest swings among  Asia ’s
most-traded currencies is deterring  State Street Global Advisors 
and Pioneer Investments from the nation’s bonds.  Bank Indonesia received $1.24 billion of bids at its first
foreign-exchange swap auction yesterday, compared with the $500
million target and $600 million granted, it said in a statement
on its website.  “The large demand is a reflection of the underlying
shortage of dollars,” Thio of BNP Paribas said.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 fell 10 basis points to 7.93 percent today, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show. It dropped 23 basis points
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
