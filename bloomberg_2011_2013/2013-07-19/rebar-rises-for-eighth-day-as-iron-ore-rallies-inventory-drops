Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  advanced for an eighth day as iron ore climbed to the
highest in more than two months and inventory fell.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose as much as 0.5 percent to 3,698  yuan  ($602) a
metric ton, before trading at 3,691 yuan at 10:26 a.m. local
time. The contract settled at 3,680 yuan yesterday, the highest
close for a most-active contract since April 19.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port rose for an
eighth day yesterday, adding 1.2 percent to $131.90 a dry ton,
the highest since April 30, according to The Steel Index Ltd.
Rebar inventory tracked by Shanghai’s Steelhome Information
Technology Co. in China fell for the 14th week last week,
declining 2.8 percent.  “As raw material prices are going up, the steel mills have
been raising their products’ prices,” said Ren Xinlei, an
analyst at Luzheng Futures Co. in Jinan. “Despite concern about
the Chinese economy, the iron ore and steel seemed to have
established an upward trend.”  The average  spot price  for rebar in  China  was little
changed at 3,442 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
