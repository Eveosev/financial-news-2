Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures dropped

driving valuations to the highest level since October.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for July delivery fell 0.2
percent to 6,041 at 9:54 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX

The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded

performance,” Navneet Munot, chief investment officer in Mumbai
at SBI Funds, a unit of India’s largest bank that manages $10.1
billion in assets, told Bloomberg TV India yesterday. “Some
consumer and technology stocks are at an all-time high, some
stocks have fallen to record lows in terms of price and
valuation. On one side there is overvaluation and on the other,
there is a lot of value one can find.”  Tata Consultancy  Shares of  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , Asia’s largest
computer-services exporter by market value, may be active after
the company reported first-quarter profit that beat estimates.
