Japanese  shares  fell ahead of
elections this weekend, halting a four-day advance in the  Topix (TPX) 
index, as non-ferrous metal producers led declines among the
measure’s 33 industry groups.  Cable-maker  Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. (5802) , which
accounts for 31 percent of a Topix gauge tracking non-ferrous
metals companies, lost 3.3 percent as  Japan ’s copper-wire and
cable shipments fell.  Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co. (7735)  lost
5.1 percent after the chip-equipment maker’s No. 1 customer cut
its sales forecast.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) , the world’s
largest merchant-ship operator, slid 1.4 percent. Consumer
lender Orix Corp. advanced 5.2 percent.  The Topix slid 0.8 percent to 1,211.98 at the close in
Tokyo, after rising as much as 0.8 percent. Volume was 20
percent above the 30-day average. The gauge added 0.8 percent
this week. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 1.5 percent to
14,589.91. Futures on the measure slid 1 percent in  Osaka  after
falling as much as 2.6 percent.  “There’s some profit-taking ahead of elections,” said
Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee the equivalent of $33
billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co. “Abe winning the upper
house is already priced in and there’s a feeling that all the
good news is out already. Shares should start rising again once
we see good earnings results.”  After  plunging  as much as 18 percent from a May 22 high,
the Topix rebounded amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will
push through economic reforms following the polls. The gauge
rose for a fifth week, the biggest such advance since April 2009
and the longest winning streak since February.  Profits at Topix companies will  rise  94 percent compared to
the previous quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Full-year earnings are projected to jump 57 percent,
the data shows.  Weekend Elections  A victory in the elections would end a split parliament by
giving Abe’s coalition control of both chambers. His  Liberal
Democratic Party  would have the strongest mandate since 2007,
enabling it to carry out a program of monetary easing, fiscal
stimulus and structural reform known as Abenomics.  The LDP and coalition partner New Komeito are on track to
win more than enough seats to secure a majority, according to a
poll published in the Nikkei newspaper on July 17.  “The speed at which the government will enact policies is
going to impact the buying of Japanese stocks by foreign
investors,” said Juichi Wako, a Tokyo-based senior strategist
at Nomura Securities Co., the nation’s biggest brokerage. “They
are going to be focusing on whether they can pass legislation in
the extraordinary parliamentary sessions in August.”  Futures Tumble  Nikkei 225 futures traded in Osaka  tumbled  as much as 2.6
percent in 12 minutes this morning, triggering a sell-off in the
cash-equities markets.  “Futures falling shows there’s some fast money taking
profit and closing positions ahead of the weekend elections,”
saidNader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset allocation 
at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages more than $130
billion. “The market is expecting a landslide victory, and
anything less than that could be a short-term disappointment so
some investors are taking profits now.”  Japan’s currency strengthened 0.4 percent against the
dollar today after weakening 0.8 percent yesterday. The yen is
the worst-performing major currency since mid-November.  Dainippon Screen, which makes machines that clean
semiconductor wafers, declined 5.1 percent to 574 yen for its
biggest loss in a month.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) ,
the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips, forecast
sales that trailed estimates. TSMC accounts for  10 percent  of
the Kyoto, western Japan-based company’s revenue, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Advantest Slides  Tokyo Electron Ltd., which also counts TSMC as a customer,
sank 5.7 percent to 4,790 yen.  Advantest Corp. (6857) , the world’s
biggest maker of chip-manufacturing equipment, slumped 7 percent
after its rating was cut to neutral at Nomura Holdings Inc.  Sumitomo Electric fell 3.3 percent to 1,317 yen, the most
since June 21, as the Topix Nonferrous Metals Index slumped 2.4
percent. Japan’s copper-wire and cable shipments decreased for
the sixth time in seven months, according to a statement by the
Japanese Electric Wire and Cable Maker’s Association today.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines slid 1.4 percent to 414 yen after
falling as much as 3.1 percent.  Orix, which  accounts  for 41 percent of the Topix gauge
tracking consumer lenders, jumped 5.2 percent to 1,547 yen,
leading the sector to the biggest gain on the Topix. Hitachi
Capital Corp., which also provides consumer-financing services,
added 1.8 percent to 2,322 yen.  Technical Indicators  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The measure added 0.5 percent yesterday as earnings at
companies from Morgan Stanley to UnitedHealth Group Inc. beat
estimates and initial jobless claims dropped to the lowest since
May.  The Topix’s Relative Strength Index, which tracks the
velocity of price changes, was at 63.52 today, near the 70
threshold some traders see as a sign that stocks may be poised
to fall. The 25-day Toraku Index, which compares the numbers of
advancing and declining stocks on the gauge, reached 136.85
yesterday, above the 130 level some investors say signals stocks
may decline.  The Topix  traded  at 1.30 times book value today, compared
with 2.49 for the S&P 500 and 1.69 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday. The gauge’s 30-day  historic volatility  was at
29.60 today, down 32 percent from its July 2 high of 43.22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
