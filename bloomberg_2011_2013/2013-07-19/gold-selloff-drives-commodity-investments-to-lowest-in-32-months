Commodity assets under management
fell to a 32-month low in June as investors pulled more money
from gold-backed exchange-traded products, Barclays Plc said.  Assets dropped to $349 billion from $367 billion in May,
the London-based bank said in a report e-mailed today.
Investments in precious-metals ETPs slid to $107 billion from
$122 billion. Assets held in gold-backed ETPs declined 66.5
metric tons to a three-year low, a sixth month of redemptions,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bullion tumbled 11 percent in June, the most since
September 2011, as some investors lost faith in gold as a store
of value and the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated it may start
tapering its record bond-buying program. Metals including silver
and copper also retreated last month, while crude oil and rice
were among raw materials that rose.  “Liquidation of gold ETPs continues to be the main factor
driving commodity assets under management lower,” Barclays
analyst  Suki Cooper  wrote in the report. “Other commodity
assets have been much more stable.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of 24 raw
materials rose 0.2 percent in June, the first gain in three, and
is up 1 percent this year. Gold for immediate delivery plunged
23 percent so far in 2013 and silver is down 36 percent.  Fed Policy  “Gold and silver face the most downside risk in the third
quarter,” Cooper wrote. “Gold continues to take its cue from
U.S. Fed policy.”  The central bank’s bond purchases “are by no means on a
preset course” and will depend on the U.S. economy’s
performance, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said this week. Gold
is still down 5.5 percent since he signaled May 22 the stimulus
may slow.  Assets in ETPs backed by gold plunged 25 percent this year
as investors pulled a record 653 tons from the funds, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Holdings of 1,978.9 tons are the
lowest since May 2010, according to the figures.  Assets held in all commodity-related ETPs declined 9.4
percent to $144 billion for the month and index investments fell
2.4 percent to $121 billion, Barclays said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
