Gold futures rose, capping the
second straight weekly gain, as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  signaled that the pace of U.S. monetary stimulus
probably will be maintained.  Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that
it was “way too early to make any judgment” on whether debt
purchases will be scaled back in September. Gold soared 70
percent from the end of December 2008 to June 2011 as the Fed
kept borrowing costs at a record low and bought $2.3 trillion of
bonds in two rounds of so-called quantitative easing. The metal
climbed 1.3 percent this week.  “Most believe that Bernanke’s comments indicated the Fed
will keep its quantitative easing in place at least a little
longer than what it thought just a few weeks ago,” Peter Hug,
the global trading director of Kitco Metals Inc., said in a
report.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,294 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
the highest settlement since June 19. Last week, the metal
jumped 5.4 percent, the most since October 2011.  Gold has slumped 23 percent this year, erasing $59.4
billion from the value of  exchange-traded products  backed by the
metal, partly on bets that the Fed will reduce stimulus. Some
investors also lost faith in the commodity as a store of value
amid an equity rally and low inflation.  ‘Disaster Insurance’  Yesterday, ETP holdings fell 3.1 metric tons to 1,978.9
tons, the lowest since May 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Gold prices dropped this year because investor demand for
“disaster insurance” declined, Bernanke said yesterday.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$19.46 an ounce on the Comex. The price, down 1.7 percent this
week, has tumbled 36 percent in 2013.  In the  spot market , an ounce of gold bought as much as 66.6
ounces of silver, the most since August 2010, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery jumped 1.2 percent to $1,431.20 an ounce. The
price climbed 1.7 percent this week.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose 0.3 percent
to $749.75 an ounce. This week, the metal gained 3.7 percent,
the third straight increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
