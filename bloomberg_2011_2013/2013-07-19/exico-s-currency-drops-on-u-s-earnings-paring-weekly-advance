Mexico ’s peso fell, paring its
weekly rally, as disappointing earnings from Google Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. prompted concern that growth among companies in
the U.S., Mexico’s biggest export market, will be limited.  The currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 12.5473 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:39 a.m. in Mexico City, the worst performance among
the dollar’s major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. The peso
declined for a second day, paring its gain this week to 2.2
percent, still the biggest increase among emerging-market
currencies. The currency was headed for a five-day rally as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  quelled speculation
that a reduction of a stimulus program that has buoyed demand
for emerging-market assets was imminent.  “After the significant rally, we’re seeing a bit” of a
drop,  Rafael Camarena , an economist at Grupo Financiero
Santander Mexico SAB, said in a telephone interview from Mexico
City. “It’s a temporary reversal.”  Yields on benchmark peso bonds due in 2024 fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.77 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.23
centavo to 135.24 centavos per peso.  Google shares dropped 2.3 percent to $889.40 after second-quarter sales and profit fell short of estimates. Microsoft sank
9.5 percent to $32.15 after the  software company  said fourth-quarter profit missed analysts’ projections by the biggest
margin in at least a decade. Mexico sends about 80 percent of
its exports to the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
