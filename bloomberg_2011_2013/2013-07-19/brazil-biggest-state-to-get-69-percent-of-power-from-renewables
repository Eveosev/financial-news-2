Brazil ’s most populous state plans
to boost the portion of energy it gets from renewable sources to
69 percent by 2020 by burning more sugar-cane residues.  Sao Paulo gets about 55 percent of its energy from
renewable sources now, including 4,800 megawatts produced at
cane mills, the state’s energy ministry said on its  website 
yesterday. The industry has the potential to more than double
electricity to 13,000 megawatts within seven years.  The so-called Paulista Energy Plan will help the state meet
a voluntary goal to curb climate change. Sao Paulo also plans to
install wind and solar-energy plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
