South African white-corn futures
fell for a second day as prices slid further in the U.S., the
world’s largest grower of the grain, on signs of wetter weather.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, dropped 0.4 percent to 2,365 rand ($240) a metric ton
by the close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in September
gained 0.3 percent to 2,214 rand a ton.  Temperatures that reached 96 degrees Fahrenheit (36 degrees
Celsius) yesterday in the U.S. Midwest, the nation’s main corn
and soybean region, will begin dropping tomorrow and some areas
may see “scattered light to locally moderate showers,”
forecaster DTN said. Corn headed for a fifth drop in six today
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  “The white corn came down more today as good weather is
predicted in the U.S.,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty)
Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria .  South Africa is the continent’s largest corn producer. Meal
made from white corn is one of the country’s staple foods and
yellow corn is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in December gained 0.3 percent to 3,357
rand a ton in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
