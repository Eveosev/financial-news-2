Spot wholesale electricity on the
largest U.S. grid climbed for a third day as hot and humid
weather lifted demand above forecasts.  Demand on the 13-state PJM Interconnection LLC network,
which includes Philadelphia, Washington and Chicago, was 133,341
megawatts at 9:30 a.m., 4.8 percent higher than the day-ahead
outlook for the hour, according to the grid’s website. The
 average spot price  during the highest-demand hours surged to a
one-year high yesterday.  Heat warnings and advisories are in place from Maine to
 Iowa  and southern Canada as the heat wave enters its sixth day
in many places, according to the  National Weather Service . The
high in Washington may be 98 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius), 9
above normal, and Chicago may be 8 higher than the usual reading
at 92, said AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Spot power at PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which includes
deliveries to Washington, rose $15.65, or 15 percent, to $119.27
a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 9 a.m. from the same
time yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
Yesterday’s day-ahead outlook for the hour was $79.27.  The average price for on-peak power, which covers Monday
through Friday from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., averaged $147.26 a
megawatt-hour yesterday, the most since July 6, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
