Commodities advanced to the highest
level in more than three months and headed for a fourth weekly
increase in the best run since February.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 raw materials
climbed as much as 0.3 percent to 652.85, the highest level
since April 2, and was little changed at 3:24 p.m. in Singapore.
Gold for immediate delivery added 0.5 percent to $1,290.60 an
ounce, while wheat in Chicago advanced 0.8 percent.  The gauge is up 1 percent this week in the best winning
streak since the eight-week rally through Feb. 1. U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week the central
bank’s bond purchases “are by no means on a preset course” and
could even be expanded if economic conditions warrant. The
Bloomberg  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against 10
currencies, is heading for a second weekly decline.  The S&P GSCI has risen 0.7 percent this year as oil in New
York jumped 18 percent and natural gas advanced 11 percent. West
Texas Intermediate crude was little changed after climbing to a
16-month high yesterday as data showed the number of Americans
who filed for jobless benefits dropped to the fewest since early
May. Gas rose to a four-week high yesterday as U.S. stockpiles
increased by less than forecast last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
