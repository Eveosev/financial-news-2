Australia ’s New South Wales, the
nation’s most-populous state, awarded contracts worth A$755
million ($692 million) to help upgrade Sydney’s water network.  A range of delivery contractors have been selected to
design and construct assets for the water and wastewater
systems,  Greg Pearce , the New South Wales minister for finance
and services, said in a statement today. The contracts were
given to companies including a  Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY)  venture known
as Balfour Beatty Leed and Veolia Water Network Services Pty.  “Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Illawarra have a
growing population and with that comes the need for efficient
water and wastewater services in existing and developing suburbs
and for business,” Pearce said in the statement.  The upgrades will include water main renewal and sewer
upgrades, Pearce said.  Other contract winners include Comdain Infrastructure,
Diona Pty, Interflow Pty, ITS Trenchless Pty, Kembla Watertech
Pty, Metropolitan Restorations, Water Infrastructure Group Pty
and the Zinfra Group, according to the statement.  About two-thirds of New South  Wales ’s population was
located in the greater Sydney area as of June 2012,  according  to
the Australian Bureau of Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
