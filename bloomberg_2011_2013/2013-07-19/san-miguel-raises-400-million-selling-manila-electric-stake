San Miguel Corp. (SMC) , the largest
Philippine company, raised $400 million selling a part of its
stake in  Manila Electric Co. (MER)  at a discount to fund an expansion
beyond beer and food. The shares of both companies fell.  San Miguel sold 64.3 million shares, or 5.7 percent, at 270
pesos apiece, it said today in a stock exchange filing, without
identifying the buyer. The sale exceeded the planned offer of as
many as 48 million shares and was priced at the bottom of a 270
peso to 280 peso range, according to the terms obtained by
 Bloomberg News  yesterday.  Selling a portion of its 32.8 percent stake in the
country’s biggest power retailer will help  San Miguel ’s foray
into airlines, energy and infrastructure. The company that
started making beer before the country declared independence
from  Spain  more than 100 years ago plans to raise about $4
billion selling power assets to fund the expansion, San Miguel
President Ramon Ang said on July 12.  Manila Electric dropped as much as 9.1 percent to 275 pesos
as of 11:30 a.m. in Manila, poised for the sharpest drop since
Nov. 6, 2009. San Miguel fell as much as 4.4 percent. The
benchmark Philippine Stock Index fell 0.6 percent.  “It’s simply reflecting the discounted price,” Alex Pomento, a Manila-based strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd., said
of Manila Electric’s price drop. “There’s nothing wrong with
the fundamentals of the company.”  Manila  Electric, also known as Meralco, serves a quarter of
the nation’s population in an area that accounts for half of
gross domestic product. The company, 48.3 percent owned by units
of billionaire Anthoni Salim’s First Pacific Co., posted a 19
percent gain in first-quarter profit to 4 billion pesos.  San Miguel and its units had acquired most of their holding
in Meralco at 90 pesos each in 2008.  The company plans to sell its Meralco shares in phases and
49 percent of unit SMC Global Power Holdings Corp., Ang said on
July 12. SMC Global Power is the country’s biggest electricity
generator with assets accounting for a fifth of the nation’s
capacity. The generation unit’s equity value is at least $1.6
billion, Ang said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
