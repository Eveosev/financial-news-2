The  Bank of Canada  said it will
increase the amount of money available to help settle payments
between financial institutions effective Monday, citing
“frictions.”  The minimum amount that will be left in the central bank’s
Large Value Transfer System will rise to C$250 million ($241
million) from C$25 million until further notice, according to a
 statement  from Ottawa today.  “Indicators of the overnight interest rate have recently
been slightly, but persistently, above the Bank’s target for the
overnight rate, indicating some ongoing frictions in the
system,” the central bank said in the statement.  The move has no implications for monetary policy, spokesman
 Jeremy Harrison  said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
