The  National Basketball Association 
approved new uses of instant replay, giving officials permission
to reverse a charge call or uphold a blocking penalty.  The rule modifications go into effect for the 2013-14 NBA
season.  The board of governors yesterday said officials would be
allowed to review the block/charge play to determine if the
defender was inside or outside the restricted area.  Instant replay also can be used to determine if an off-ball
foul occurred before or after a player started his shooting
motion on a successful shot attempt or when it occurred on a
throw-in.  Officials also can assess penalties of unsportsmanlike
conduct or acts such as flagrant fouls that are seen on instant
replay reviews.  A clear-path foul no longer will be assessed if, before the
foul is committed, the defender is positioned ahead of the
offensive player in the frontcourt.  The fifth rule modification calls for a team on offense to
lose possession if its player leaves the floor and doesn’t
immediately return. The rule doesn’t pertain to players who are
injured or attempting to save the ball.  To contact the reporter on this story:
