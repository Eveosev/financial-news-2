National Hockey League players will
compete in the 2014 Winter Olympics.  It will be the fifth consecutive  Winter Games  where the
world’s top hockey league will send its players to compete for
medals.  “The decision to participate in the XXII Olympic Winter
Games in Sochi was in many ways a difficult one, but one that we
know will be well received by our players, and most importantly,
by the vast majority of our fans and sports fans everywhere,”
NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.  Canada took the gold medal in the 2010 Winter Olympics,
where Pittsburgh Penguins captain  Sidney Crosby  scored the
winning goal to defeat the U.S. in overtime of the final in
 Vancouver .  The 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, will require the
league to stop its season on Feb. 9 and return Feb. 26.
Negotiations between the NHL, the NHL Players Association, the
 International Olympic Committee  and the International Ice Hockey
Federation had been held periodically since the NHL lockout
ended in January.  This year’s lockout resulted in a 48-game NHL regular
season, down from 82, making the decision to halt the 2013-14
campaign for the Olympics more difficult than previous years.
League owners have complained that they both lose revenue from
the break and risk injury to their top players in games that
mean nothing in the standings.  The Sochi Winter Olympics are  scheduled  for Feb. 6-23, with
the men’s hockey competition beginning on Feb. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
