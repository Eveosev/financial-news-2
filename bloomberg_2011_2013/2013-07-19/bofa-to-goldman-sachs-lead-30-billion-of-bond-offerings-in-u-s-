Bank of America Corp.  and  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  led at least $30 billion of corporate bond
 sales  in the U.S. this week, the busiest period in almost two
months, as relative yields narrowed.  Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, sold $2
billion of 10-year securities and New York-based Goldman Sachs
issued $2.5 billion at its lowest relative yield for five-year
debt since the financial crisis, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offerings increased from  $24.6 billion  last week and
were the most since $36.8 billion in the five days ended May 24.  The extra yield investors demand to own company bonds
rather than government debentures narrowed to 219 basis points
yesterday from 227 basis points on July 12, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch US Corporate & High Yield index.
Yields decreased to 3.99 percent from 4.13 percent, and compare
with a record low 3.35 percent on May 2, index data show.  Bank of America sold $2 billion of 4.1 percent debt due
July 2023 at a relative yield of 157 basis points, Bloomberg
data show. The  Charlotte , North Carolina-based lender will use
proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction, who
asked not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly. The debt is rated A- by  Standard & Poor’s , Bloomberg
data show.  Bonds Gain  The bonds rose 0.9 cent today from the issue price to 100.8
cents on the dollar to yield 4 percent, or a spread of 148.9
basis points, at 9:09 a.m. New York time, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Goldman Sachs sold 2.9 percent debentures due July 2018 at
a relative yield of 155 basis points, its lowest spread on five-year securities since it sold $2 billion of 5.45 percent notes
at a 110 basis-point spread in October 2007, Bloomberg data
show.  The securities climbed 0.9 cent since the July 16 sale to
100.8 cents on the dollar to yield 2.72 percent, or a 139.9
basis-point spread at 9:18 a.m. in  New York , Trace data show.  Sales of investment-grade debentures rose to at least $25
billion from  $23.1 billion  last week and above a 2013 weekly
average of  $21.9 billion , the data show. Offerings of
speculative-grade bonds reached at least $5.3 billion, compared
with  $1.5 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly average of $7.3
billion.  High-yield, high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at S&P.  Issuers planning sales include tobacco processor Alliance
One International Inc. with a $790 million sale of eight-year
notes, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
