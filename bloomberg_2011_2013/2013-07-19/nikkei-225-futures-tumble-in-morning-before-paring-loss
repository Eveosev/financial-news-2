Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
futures in  Osaka  tumbled as much as 2.6 percent in 12 minutes
this morning before paring declines.  Nikkei 225 futures fell 440 points to 14,410 between 10:15
a.m. to 10:27 a.m. local time, with volume more than twice the
five-day intraday average. The gauge traded at 14,660 as of
12:18 p.m., paring declines to 1 percent. The Nikkei 225 cash
equities measure lost 1.1 percent at the trading break. Japan
will hold elections on Sunday that are expected to give Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe a mandate to pursue economic reforms.  “Futures falling shows there’s some fast money taking
profit and closing positions ahead of the weekend elections,”
said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset allocation 
at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages more than $130
billion. “The market is expecting a landslide victory, and
anything less than that could be a short-term disappointment so
some investors are taking profits now.”  After  plunging  21 percent from this year’s high on May 22
through June 13, Nikkei 225 Futures in Osaka rebounded 19
percent to yesterday.  Japanese shares have been rising amid optimism Abe will
push through reforms following the elections. The Topix index is
poised to rise for a fifth week, its longest weekly winning
streak since February.  A victory in the polls would end a split parliament by
giving Abe’s coalition control of both chambers. His  Liberal
Democratic Party  would have the strongest mandate since 2007,
enabling it to carry out a program of monetary easing, fiscal
stimulus and structural reform known as Abenomics.  The LDP and coalition partner New Komeito are on track to
win more than enough seats to secure a majority, according to a
poll published in the Nikkei newspaper on July 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
