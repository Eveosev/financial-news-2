Coffee exports from  Uganda  may drop
2.1 percent this month following the end of the main harvest for
southern and southwestern regions, the state-run Uganda Coffee
Development Authority said.  Shipments may slide to 300,000 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags
from 306,331 bags in July 2012, the authority said by e-mail.
The forecast compares with 361,146 bags in June.  Exports in the nine months through June rose to 2.644
million bags from 2.011 million bags a year earlier, the
authority said. Deliveries from July 1, 2012, through June rose
to 3.36 million bags worth $422 million from 3.04 million bags
valued at $441 million.  Uganda projects exports of 3.2 million bags of the beans in
the 12 months through September against 2.73 million bags in
2011-12. Output in 2012-13 is projected at 3.4 million to 3.5
million bags.  To contact the reporter on this story:
