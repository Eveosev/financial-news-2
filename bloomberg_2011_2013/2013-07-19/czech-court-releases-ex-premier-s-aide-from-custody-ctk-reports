A Czech court ordered the release
from custody of a senior aide to former Prime Minister Petr Necas because there was no longer a risk she’d pressure
witnesses, CTK newswire reported, citing court spokeswoman Lucie
Bohmova.  Jana Nagyova, charged with ordering illegal surveillance of
three people, will be set free pending trial, together with
Ondrej Palenik, the former head of the country’s military
intelligence service, and Roman Bocek, former deputy agriculture
minister, according to the newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
