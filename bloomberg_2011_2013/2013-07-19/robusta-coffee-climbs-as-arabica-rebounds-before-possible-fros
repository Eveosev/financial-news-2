Robusta coffee advanced for a fifth
day in  London  and arabica rebounded before possible frost in
 Brazil , the largest grower. Cocoa rose to an eight-month high.  Frost is a “significant threat” in Brazil on July 23 and
July 24, mostly across the southern fringes of coffee growing
areas, MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg, Maryland, said in a
report e-mailed yesterday. Arabica prices erased gains yesterday
on speculation frost won’t affect main growing areas.  “Frost premium and weather jitters will allow for the
occassional sharp rally,” said Sterling Smith, a futures
specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago . “Without a weather
issue, the market will have trouble sustaining rallies.”  Arabica for September delivery climbed 1.2 percent to
$1.2905 a pound by 4:42 a.m. in  New York  on ICE Futures U.S.
Robusta for September delivery jumped 0.9 percent to $1,987 a
metric ton (90.12 cents a pound) on NYSE Liffe in London.  Cocoa in London climbed as much as 0.8 percent to 1,605
pounds ($2,447) a ton, the highest price for a most-active
contract since Nov. 15. Cocoa in New York jumped 1 percent to
$2,370 a ton.  White, or refined, sugar was unchanged at $463.90 a ton and
raw sugar advanced 0.2 percent to 16.21 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
