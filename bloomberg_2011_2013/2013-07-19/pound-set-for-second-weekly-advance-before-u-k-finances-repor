economic recovery is gaining traction,” said Eimear Daly, head
of market analysis at Monex Europe Ltd. in  London . “The market
consensus is that the GDP data next week will support that view.
It’s likely the data may surprise on the upside.”  The pound climbed 0.2 percent to $1.5257 at 4:22 p.m.
London time, extending this week’s advance to 1 percent.

progress with the deficit in this fiscal year than there was
after last month’s figures,” wrote Sam Hill, a fixed-income
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in London.  The benchmark 10-year yield increased three basis points,
