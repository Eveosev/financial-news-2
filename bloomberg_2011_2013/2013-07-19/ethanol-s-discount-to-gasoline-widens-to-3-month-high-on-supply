Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened for a third day on speculation easing corn costs will
boost output.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 4.26 cents to
64.94 cents a gallon as the corn crush spread, or the cost
difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to
make it, was 35 cents today, based on September contracts for
the grain and biofuel, compared with minus 35 cents on Dec. 31,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “It’s following in pattern with corn and the crush,” said
Justin Dirico, manager of the biofuels desk at Eagle Energy
Brokers LLC in  New York . “Everything seems to have softened.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 2.9 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.474 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 13 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery increased 1.36 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.1234 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Tracking certificates, known as Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, are used by refiners and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, to show compliance with
government mandates to use ethanol.  Ethanol Certificates  Corn-based ethanol RINs  fell 5 cents to $1.36 at 10:27 a.m.
New York time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs,
which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol,
were unchanged at $1.42.  Both varieties of the RINs reached records on July 17 and
the price increase was the subject of congressional hearings
this week.  Corn for September delivery rose 3 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $5.44 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of the renewable fuel. The more actively-traded December
contract was unchanged at $5.0075.  Ethanol  production  last week slipped 0.6 percent to 876,000
barrels a day from the previous week, the U.S. Energy
Information Administration said in a July 17 report.  Stockpiles of the biofuel jumped 5.5 percent to 16.6
million barrels, the biggest gain since Nov. 16 and the highest
level since May 3, data from the Energy Department’s analytical
arm show.  Supplies increased as  imports  of the biofuel doubled to
50,000 barrels a day, the most since June 14, EIA data show.  Spot Prices  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in New York
at $2.61 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In Chicago,
the additive slumped 9 cents to $2.51; in the U.S. Gulf, prices
sank 9 cents to $2.585; and on the West Coast ethanol increased
1 cent to $2.695 a gallon.  Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor swelled 9 cents to 10
cents while the West Coast’s premium to the  Gulf Coast  jumped 10
cents to 11 cents, the widest in a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
