A  Dominion Resources Inc. (D)  unit’s
application for an air quality permit for a natural-gas
compressor station must be evaluated by a Maryland state agency,
a federal appeals court in  Washington  ruled.  The Maryland Department of the Environment should disclose
valid zoning objections by local governments involved in the
case or process the application, Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith
wrote for a three-judge panel in an opinion issued today.  “The department must either identify one or more
‘applicable’ (that is, not pre-empted) zoning or land use
requirements with which Dominion has not demonstrated
compliance, or it must process Dominion’s application for an air
quality permit,” Griffith wrote.  The case is Dominion Transmission Inc. v. Summers, 13-1019,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
