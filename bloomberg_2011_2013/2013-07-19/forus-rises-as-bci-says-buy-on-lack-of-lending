Forus SA (FORUS) , a Chilean seller of
Columbia-brand clothes, posted its biggest two-day gain since
March as Banco de Credito e Inversiones said the retailer’s lack
of consumer lending protects it from regulatory changes.  The shares increased 1.9 percent to 2,752.1 pesos at 3:01
p.m. in Santiago, extending their gain over the past two days to
5.4 percent. The benchmark  IPSA (IPSA)  index fell 1.3 percent.  BCI initiated  coverage  of Santiago-based Forus with an
“overweight” recommendation, the equivalent of buy, and a
year-end 2014 target price of 3,480 pesos. The bank cited
growing profits and expectations that Forus will increase store
surface area by 30 percent by 2015, analysts Veronica Perez and
Marcelo Catalan said in an e-mailed note to clients today.  “Unlike its peers, Forus doesn’t have a  consumer-lending 
arm, a sector that has been under scrutiny by regulators,” BCI
said. “It’s not exposed to the volatility that has affected
other retail stocks.”  Chile’s Congress is due to vote on limits to consumer-lending  interest rates , BCI said in the note. In May, Cencosud
SA, Chile’s largest retailer by sales, said it would set aside
$40 million in provisions after Chile’s  Supreme Court  ordered
the company to compensate clients for what consumer-rights
advocates said were abusive clauses in credit-card contracts.  Forus has gained 38 percent in the past 12 months, the best
performance among IPSA members. The index has retreated 12
percent during the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
