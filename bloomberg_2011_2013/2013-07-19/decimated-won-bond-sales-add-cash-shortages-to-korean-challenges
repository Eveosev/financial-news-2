South Korea ’s corporate bond sales
this month have plunged to about a tenth of offerings a year
ago, as borrowing costs near a 10-month high hamper growth
prospects of  Asia ’s fourth-largest economy.  Sales total 322 billion won ($286 million) since June 30
versus 3.01 trillion won a year earlier and 1.25 trillion won
last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Doosan
Engineering & Construction Co. (011160)  leads expected sales this week of
182 billion won, compared with a weekly average this year of
about 588 billion won, the data show.  Bank of Korea  Governor Kim Choong Soo held benchmark rates
unchanged for a second straight month last week as he weighs
signs of a global economic recovery against the need to curb
spiraling yields. Corporate note sales slid to the least since
September 2008 last quarter, mirroring a rout in global markets
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben. S. Bernanke signaled the
central bank’s bond-buying program could be tapered as early as
this year.  “Sales may remain in the doldrums for a while,” said Min Dong Won, a credit analyst at Seoul-based Hyundai Securities Co.
“Market sentiment remains far from any recovery and is weighed
down by concerns over external risks that  Korea  can’t control
such as the Fed tapering stimulus and  China ’s slowdown.” China
is South Korea’s biggest trading partner.  Capital Squeeze  Average yields  on three-year corporate notes rated AA- were
unchanged this week at 3.33 percent as of July 18, according to
data from the Korea Financial Investment Association. The rate
touched 3.48 percent on June 24, the highest since August 2012.  The country’s Financial Services Commission unveiled on
July 8 a plan to sell so-called primary-collateralized bond
obligations, or PCBO, to bolster funding for companies facing a
financing squeeze as economic growth slows.  Doosan Engineering & Construction, a Seoul-based provider
of civil engineering and architectural services, sold 100
billion won of 7.8 percent two-year notes on July 16, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The company, part-owned by Doosan Heavy
Industries & Construction Co., will use the proceeds mostly for
refinancing, said Harry Jun, general manager in the investor
relations department.  “We issued the bonds just in case the capital squeeze will
worsen, even though we have enough cash for refinancing,” Jun
said. “Yields are likely to stay at current levels for the time
being since the government is issuing primary-collateralized
bond obligations and the Bank of Korea is keeping rates
steady.”  Sentiment Low  AJ Rent A Car Co. (068400) , an auto rental company, issued 32
billion won of 3.6 percent notes due 2015 on July 15, the data
show. It plans to use the money for working capital, according
to a July 16 regulatory filing.  While the FSC’s plan to provide refinancing support to spur
issuance may offer “a short-term boost, sentiment still remains
too low for companies to borrow by simply relying on the
possibility of government aid,” Hyundai Securities’ Min said.  Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo and his board kept
the seven-day  repurchase rate  at 2.5 percent on July 11. Kim
afterward told reporters the central bank sees gross domestic
product rising 4 percent in 2014, up from an April projection of
3.8 percent. The BOK raised its 2013 GDP forecast to a gain of
2.8 percent, compared with 2.6 percent in April.  Dollar Cost  Three-year  sovereign note yields  rose to 3.12 percent on
June 24, the highest since last July, and were at 2.85 percent
on July 18, Bloomberg data show. The extra yield investors
demand to own Korean company notes over similar-maturity
government debt has narrowed to 48 basis points from 59 basis
points a year ago.  South Korea’s won has weakened 5.5 percent against the
greenback this year and was at 1,124 per dollar at 9:14 a.m. in
Seoul today.  Moorim Paper Co. (009200) , a Gyeongnam, South Korea-based paper
maker, is expected to price 30 billion won of notes this week,
data on preliminary sales compiled by Bloomberg show. Woori
Finance Holdings Co. is also planning a 50 billion won-bond sale
later this month, the data show.  Korea international bond sales rose to $1.03 billion this
month-to-date from $130 million the same period of June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The one-year rate to swap won loans for dollars, a gauge of
the availability of dollar funding, was at 1.63 percent today,
after touching 1.38 percent on June 24, the lowest since October
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
