The Fox broadcast network delayed
the fifth-season premiere of “Glee” by one week, citing the
death of actor Cory Monteith.  20th Century Fox Television, part of  Rupert Murdoch ’s 21st
 Century Fox Inc. (FOXA) , is delaying the season debut until Sept. 26,
according to an e-mailed statement today. Fox had planned to
bring back the show, about a high-school singing club, on Sept.
19, ahead of Major League Baseball’s playoffs.  Monteith was found dead on July 13 in a Vancouver hotel
room. The 31-year-old actor, who played a popular athlete and
singer, was one of the main characters. Fox said in May the
season finale drew 5.9 million viewers. Monteith, who had
struggled with substance-abuse problems, died of an overdose of
heroin and alcohol, the British Columbia coroner’s office said
this week, according to the Associated Press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
