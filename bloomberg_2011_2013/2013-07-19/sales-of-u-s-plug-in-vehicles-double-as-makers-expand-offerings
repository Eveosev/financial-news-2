U.S. sales of plug-in electric
vehicles doubled in the first half of the year, the U.S. Energy
Department said.  Motorists bought more than 40,000 plug-in cars in the first
and second quarters, up from 17,500 a year earlier, according to
an Energy Department statement today. Full-year 2012 sales more
than tripled to about 52,000 from 17,000 in 2011.  Ford Motor Co. added hybrid and plug-in models to its
lineup and demand increased for Tesla Motor Inc.’s battery-powered sedan. That helped spur first-half growth rates, as more
carmakers offer vehicles that consume less fuel and emit less
carbon.  “As the market continues to grow, electric vehicles will
play a key role in our effort to reduce air pollution and slow
the effects of  climate change ,” Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
