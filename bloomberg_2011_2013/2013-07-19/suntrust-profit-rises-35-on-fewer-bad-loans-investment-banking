SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , Georgia’s
biggest lender, said second-quarter profit rose 35 percent as
bad-loan provisions fell.  Net income increased to $365 million, or 68 cents a share,
from $270 million, or 50 cents, a year earlier, the Atlanta-based bank said today in a statement. The  average estimate  of 29
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 67 cents a share.  SunTrust’s provision for credit losses declined by 51
percent to $146 million from a year earlier, according to the
statement. Net charge-offs also dropped by almost half, falling
to $179 million from $350 million a year earlier.  “The credit-quality story continues to be a good one with
nonperforming loans and net charge-offs hitting their lowest
levels in over five years,” Chief Executive Officer William Rogers said in a conference call following the results.  SunTrust rose 1.3 percent to $34.75 at 10:40 a.m. in New
York. The  shares  gained 21 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with the 28 percent advance of the 24-company KBW Bank
Index.  SunTrust said in May that it was in talks with U.S.
authorities to settle claims over its handling of loans backed
by the  Federal Housing Administration  and possible violations of
the  False Claims Act .  To contact the reporters on this story:
