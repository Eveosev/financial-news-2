Oil and gas  rigs  in the U.S. rose to
the highest level in a month as producers were expected to boost
activity in the second of half of this year.  The total rig count increased by 11 to 1,770, the highest
since June 14, data posted on  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) ’s website show.
 Oil rigs  rose four to 1,395, the Houston-based field services
company said on its website. Gas rigs advanced for the fourth
straight week, gaining seven to 369, a three-month high.  The total U.S. count has gained three weeks in a row.
Rising output from shale formations such as  North Dakota ’s
Bakken and  Texas ’s Eagle Ford plays have boosted domestic oil
production to the highest level since December 1990. The surge
in output, driven largely by a combination of hydraulic
fracturing and horizontal drilling, helped the nation meet 89
percent of its own energy needs in March.  U.S. onshore rig counts will “rise modestly” to an
average of 1,720 rigs by the fourth quarter of 2013, an increase
of about 30 between now and the end of the year, Peter A. Ragauss, Baker Hughes’ chief financial officer in Houston, said
in a conference call with analysts today.  The company’s forecast for offshore rigs remains unchanged
at an average of 52 rigs in the 2013, an increase of four
deepwater rigs from a year earlier, he said.  Prices, Stockpiles  Natural gas for August fell 2.3 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
settle at $3.789 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up 26 percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  gained 58 billion cubic feet in the
week ended July 12 to 2.745 trillion, the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
yesterday. Supplies were 13 percent below year-earlier levels.  U.S. oil output climbed 1.2 percent to 7.49 million barrels
a day last week, EIA data show. Stockpiles fell 1.9 percent to
367 million barrels.  Crude for August delivery rose 1 cent to $108.05 a barrel
today on the Nymex, up 17 percent in the past year.  Drilling permits for the 30 states monitored by  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  increased 4 percent in June, following a 2.7% rise in May,
James C. West, oil services and drilling analyst for the London-based company’s investment-banking unit in  New York , said in a
research note July 16. The biggest advances were in  Utah , Texas
and  Kansas , according to West.  “We believe the gradual increase in permit activity will
lead to a continued rise in drilling activity, with an
acceleration likely” in the second half, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
