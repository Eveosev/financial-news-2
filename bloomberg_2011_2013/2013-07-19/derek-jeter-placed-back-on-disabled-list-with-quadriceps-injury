The  New York  Yankees placed
shortstop Derek Jeter on the disabled list with a strained
quadriceps muscle, after the team captain played one game this
season.  Jeter returned from offseason ankle surgery on July 12 only
to sustain the low-grade strain of his right quadriceps. He was
placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to the day of the
injury, the Yankees said in a news release.  The team promoted infielder Brent Lillibridge from Triple-A
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, placing him on the team’s 40-man roster.
A corresponding 40-man roster move will be announced later
today.  Jeter, 39, missed the Yankees’ series last weekend against
the Minnesota Twins, which preceded the All-Star break. Yankees
General Manager Brian Cashman said the day after the injury that
the club wanted to avoid another stay on the disabled list for
Jeter, who had surgery for a broken ankle in October and then
had a comeback attempt halted during spring training after a
crack was found in the ankle. Cashman said Jeter’s ankle held up
well during his one game of Major League Baseball action.  New York exits the four-day All-Star break with a 51-44
record, six games behind the American League East-leading Boston
Red Sox, who are 58-39. Boston hosts the Yankees in a three
game-series that begins tonight at Fenway Park.  To contact the reporter on this story:
