GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  surged
after China announced plans to impose duties of as much as 57
percent on polysilicon from the U.S. and  South Korea .  The stock of the world’s biggest polysilicon maker rose 4.8
percent to HK$1.97 as of 11:09 a.m. in Hong Kong trading after
earlier gaining as much as 5.3 percent. The benchmark Hang Seng
Index fell as much as 0.6 percent.  Importers of the raw material to make solar panels must
begin paying the duties on July 24. The highest rate was imposed
on companies including the U.S. units of  Renewable Energy Corp
ASA (REC) , while the lowest were placed on South Korea’s OCI Co. at
2.4 percent, according to a statement on the Chinese commerce
ministry’s website yesterday.  “The decision will boost demand for domestic polysilicon
makers and their price will also increase,” Wang Minnan, a
Beijing-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said by
phone. More than half of Chinese demand for polysilicon was met
by imports before the ruling, Wang said.  Daqo New Energy Corp. (DQ) , a Chinese producer of the commodity,
rose 9.9 percent to close at $10.54 in New York yesterday,
bringing this year’s gain to 32 percent.  Chinese polysilicon makers led by GCL-Poly and Daqo
increased production in the second quarter as imports declined.
 ReneSola Ltd. (SOL)  earlier this month revived production at its
Sichuan polysilicon plant, which has an annual capacity of
10,000 metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
