Briton Chris Froome of the Sky team
maintained his 5-minute, 11-second lead heading into today’s
final mountain stage in the  Tour de France , which ends tomorrow
with a ceremonial ride to Paris.  There were no changes in the leading positions yesterday,
with Froome retaining his margin over two-time champion  Alberto Contador  of  Spain  and the Saxo team. Colombian Nairo Quintana of
the Movistar team remains 21 seconds further back in third.  Portugal’s Rui Costa won yesterday’s stage 19, a
mountainous 107-mile (172-kilometer) ride, for his second
victory in four days.  As rain started to fall, the Movistar rider attacked on the
final climb to Col de la Croix Fry to finish 48 seconds ahead of
Andreas Kloden of RadioShack, and 1:44 ahead of Kloden’s
teammate, Jan Bakelants, who was third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
