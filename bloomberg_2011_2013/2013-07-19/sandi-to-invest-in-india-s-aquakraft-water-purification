The Sandi Group agreed to invest in
 Aquakraft Projects Pvt . to help improve  India ’s water-treatment
technologies, the Washington-based company said.  The investment of as much as $7 million will fund research
for developing water-purification solutions in India through the
Mumbai-based company, said Surendra Sharma, senior adviser to
the group.  The U.S. company will help fund Aquakraft’s research in
developing water technologies for use in India’s rural areas,
Subramanya Kusnur, Aquakraft’s chairman and chief executive
officer, said by phone.  Indian companies, which often compete with the local
population for water supplies, and growing urban communities are
investing more in water treatment in a nation where only 20
percent of sewage is treated.  India plans to spend $20 billion on water treatment,
irrigation and recycling in the five years ending March 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
