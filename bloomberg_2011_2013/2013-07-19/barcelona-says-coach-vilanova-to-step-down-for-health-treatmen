Barcelona, the defending Spanish
soccer champion, said coach Tito Vilanova will step down to
receive treatment and a replacement will be named next week.  Vilanova, who took over from Pepe Guardiola before last
season, returned to New York in May for a check-up after
receiving cancer treatment there earlier in the season. The
management changes were disclosed by club President  Sandro
Rosell  at a press conference tonight in Spain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
