Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA)  rallied after Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Enrique Piedrahita said the company
will use cash and debt to pay for its $758 million acquisition
of  Chile ’s Tresmontes Lucchetti SA.  The shares gained 2.9 percent to 25,720 pesos at 11:57 a.m.
in Bogota. It was the second-best performer on the Colcap Index,
which increased 0.5 percent.  The Medellin-based maker of Zenu cold cuts and Jet
chocolates said yesterday that it will buy Santiago-based
Tresmontes Lucchetti to acquire nine production plants in Chile
and a distribution network in  Mexico . The deal is scheduled to
close by October, according to a filing yesterday.  “We have cash, and we’ll be taking on bank debt, and it
will be basically from those two sources,” Piedrahita said in
an interview broadcast by Colombian station Blu Radio today.
Piedrahita said the company had $150 million in cash and was
counting on existing credit lines to finance the rest of the
acquisition.  Nutresa posted its biggest drop in four months in March on
speculation it would sell preferred shares. Nutresa said in a
filing at the time that it didn’t have plans to issue equity in
the “foreseeable future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
