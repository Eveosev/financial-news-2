Malaysia’s 10-year bonds declined
this week, driving the yield to a two-year high, before an
official report that economists predict will show inflation
accelerated to the highest level since April 2012.  The yield on the 3.48 percent government notes due March
2023 rose 14 basis points to 3.85 percent as of 10:34 a.m. in
Kuala Lumpur, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the
highest for a  benchmark  security since July 2011. Consumer
prices  climbed  1.9 percent in June, up from 1.8 percent in May,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey before
figures due at 5 p.m. local time.  Bonds fell along with the ringgit this week on lingering
concern the Federal Reserve will rein in monetary stimulus
that’s spurred demand for emerging-market assets. Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said yesterday that the central bank intends to keep
its policy “highly accommodative for the foreseeable future.”
A report yesterday also showed jobless claims in the U.S.
dropped to the least since early May.  “Bonds are being sold because the expectation is that
local inflation will continue to inch up,” said Yeah Kim Leng,
chief economist at RAM Holdings Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The
improvement in the U.S. economy also doesn’t help.”  The government will sell 4 billion ringgit ($1.2 billion)
of Islamic bonds due 2016 at auction today, according to data
published on the central bank’s website.  The ringgit dropped 0.6 percent to 3.1965 per dollar this
week and earlier touched 3.2053, the lowest level since July 9,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It fell 0.1 percent
today. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, declined 18 basis
points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 7.78 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
