Reinsurance Group of America Inc .,
the reinsurer formerly owned by MetLife Inc. fell the most since
October as it  swung to a loss  on higher-than-expected costs from
disability coverage in Australia.  Reinsurance Group dropped 7.3 percent to 67.95 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York. The Chesterfield, Missouri-based company has
climbed 27 percent this year.  The second-quarter net loss was $49.6 million, compared
with profit of $141.1 million a year earlier, the company said
in a statement yesterday. Results included costs of $184 million
to increase claims liabilities in Australia. The company had
previously said results would be posted on July 25.  “The charge was particularly surprising and disappointing
given management’s expectation from the May investor day that
 Australia  would post a modest profit in 2013,” Keefe, Bruyette
and Woods analysts led by Jeffrey Schuman said in a research
note today. They cut their price target to $74 a share from $81.  Chief Executive Officer Greig Woodring said the company
would be “extremely selective” in the Australia group market
as it works with insurers to assess the risks. Reinsurers help
primary carriers shoulder losses.  “We have just completed a comprehensive claims analysis
within the last week, and that analysis indicates a more
dramatic deterioration than we previously anticipated,”
Woodring said in the statement. “The current environment makes
it very difficult to price new business with any degree of
confidence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
