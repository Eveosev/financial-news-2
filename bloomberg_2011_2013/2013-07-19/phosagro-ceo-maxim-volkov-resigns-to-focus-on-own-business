OAO Phosagro Chief Executive Officer
Maxim Volkov resigned after 12 years at the company to focus on
his own business projects.  Volkov, 41, submitted his resignation to the board, which
will consider it by the end of July, Phosagro said in the
statement today. He headed the management company of PhosAgro in
2006 to 2012 and has been CEO since 2009. Under Volkov’s
management Phosagro sold shares in a London initial public
offering in 2011, sold its first eurobonds this year and
consolidated its OAO Apatit unit.  “I am confident in the company’s long-term potential and
have no doubt that our team will continue to achieve sustainable
growth for Phosagro, which is why I intend to remain a
shareholder,” Volkov said in the statement. He plans to focus
on the modernization of the Pikalevo production complex and the
purchase of Pikalevskaya Soda shares, he said.  The complex buys nepheline concentrate from Phosagro.
Kommersant reported today that Andrei Guryev Jr., currently
executive vice-president at Phosagro and son of major
shareholder Andrei Guryev, is the main contender to be CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
