European stocks  closed little
changed, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index completing its fourth
weekly gain, as investors weighed worse-than-estimated earnings
from  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and Microsoft Corp.  Electrolux AB jumped 5.3 percent after raising its estimate
for U.S. demand. Schibsted ASA rallied to the highest price in
21 years after posting profit that topped projections. SAP AG
and ARM Holdings Plc led a gauge of technology shares to the
worst performance on the benchmark gauge. Royal Vopak NV tumbled
5 percent after cutting its earnings forecast.  The Stoxx 600 added less than 0.1 percent to 299.85. The
gauge gained 1.2 percent this week as Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank remains flexible on the
pace of asset purchases.  “We have had some pretty positive moves the last few
weeks, so there is room for profit taking,” said Espen Furnes,
who helps oversee about $75 billion as a  fund manager  at
Storebrand Asset Management in Oslo. “We are seeing some
weakness among technology stocks in Europe and  Asia  after the
results from Microsoft and Google.”  A gauge of European  technology companies  fell 0.7 percent
as Google Inc., owner of the world’s most popular Internet
search engine, yesterday  reported  second-quarter sales and
profit that missed analysts’ estimates. Microsoft Corp., the
largest software maker, posted fourth-quarter profit that
trailed forecasts by the biggest margin in at least a decade.  SAP, the biggest maker of business-management software,
slid 2.3 percent to 55.73 euros.  ARM Holdings , whose chip
designs are used in phones that run on Google’s Android
operating system, dropped 2.6 percent to 897.5 pence.  China Rate  European shares briefly erased losses after the People’s
Bank of  China  removed the floor on lending rates, effective
tomorrow, giving freedom to banks to set borrowing costs. They
were earlier allowed to lend at a maximum discount of 30 percent
below the benchmark lending rate. China’s one-year rate has
stayed at 6 percent since its last reduction in July 2012.  National benchmark indexes fell in 13 of the 18 western
European markets.  Germany ’s DAX, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 and
 France ’s CAC 40 all lost less than 0.1 percent.  Electrolux gained 5.3 percent to 185.40 kronor. The world’s
second-biggest maker of home appliances said demand for
appliances in the U.S. may increase as much as 7 percent in
2013, having previously forecast growth of as much as 5 percent.
The company also posted second-quarter net income of 642 million
kronor ($98 million), missing the 669 million-kronor average
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Schibsted Earnings  Schibsted ASA rallied 6.3 percent to 300.40 kroner, its
highest price at least since July 1992, after posting second-quarter Ebitda of 555 million kroner ($93 million), exceeding
the average analyst projection of 519 million kroner.  Tieto Oyj (TIE1V)  dropped 3.1 percent to 15.01 euros as  Finland ’s
biggest software producer reported second-quarter net income of
7.4 million euros ($9.7 million), less than half the 17.2
million euros estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Royal Vopak NV tumbled 5 percent to 43.54 euros, its
biggest drop since March 1, after the biggest chemical-and-oil
storage company reduced its forecast for 2013 earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to a range of 730
million euros to 780 million euros. It earlier predicted Ebitda
to be between 760 million euros and 800 million euros.  Remy Cointreau SA slid 5 percent to 78.01 euros after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered its recommendation on the shares to
underweight, a rating similar to sell, from neutral. The
brokerage said a sales recovery may take longer than previously
expected as the cognac maker yesterday reported a drop in first-quarter revenue.  Separately, a shareholder sold as many as 1.06 million
shares, or a 2.1 percent stake, in Remy at 78.50 euros to 79.50
euros each.  Scania AB dropped 4.3 percent to 141.60 kronor after the
Swedish truckmaker reported second-quarter earnings of 1.72
kronor a share, missing the average analyst forecast of 2.17
kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
