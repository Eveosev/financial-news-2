Orica Ltd. (ORI) , the world’s largest
maker of industrial explosives, fell the most in five years in
Sydney trading after saying profit will be 10 percent lower than
the previous year amid weaker demand.  The  stock  plunged 14 percent to A$18.01 at 11:39 a.m. local
time, the most since July 28, 2008.  Australia ’s benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index declined 0.5 percent.  The Melbourne-based supplier of chemicals and explosives
expects profit before one-time items in the fiscal year to Sept.
30 to be about A$585.2 million ($537 million), compared with
A$650.2 million a year ago, amid weak demand and higher costs
from the integration of its ground support unit, it said today
in a statement.  Orica, one of the  worst 10 performers  this year among
Australia’s 100 biggest companies, said its ground support unit,
which makes stabilization and ventilation systems for
underground mining and civil tunneling works, was now expected
to be break even this fiscal year. The company had previously
forecast earnings before interest and tax for the unit of A$17
million to A$25 million, compared with earnings of A$109 million
in the previous year.  A slowdown in the  mining industry  had also led to weaker
demand than “previously expected for explosives and sodium
cyanide,” Orica said in the statement.  “Specific projects are being implemented to address
performance issues in the ground support and European businesses
which are expected to deliver benefits in 2014,” the company
said. “In addition, a general review of productivity
initiatives and cost reduction opportunities is ongoing across
all areas of the Orica business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
