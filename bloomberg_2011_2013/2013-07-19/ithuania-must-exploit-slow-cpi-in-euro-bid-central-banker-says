Lithuania  should make use of slower
inflation to push ahead with its bid to join the euro area in
2015, the head of the Baltic nation’s central bank said.  Inflation is the main barrier to adopting the common
currency, Chairman Vitas Vasiliauskas said today from the
capital, Vilnius. Consumer prices rose 1.2 percent from a year
earlier in June, slowing from 2.5 percent in the same month of
2012 and 4.8 percent in June 2011, statistics office data show.  There’s a “window to fulfill the inflation criteria,”
Vasiliauskas said in a phone interview with Bloomberg TV’s Anna
Edwards. The government should “catch the moment.”  The country of 3 million, which pegs the litas to the euro,
plans to follow Estonia and Latvia in making the currency
switch. The benefits for Lithuania from joining outweigh the
risks,  Christine Lagarde , managing director of the  International
Monetary Fund , said July 17 in Vilnius.  The economy will grow 3 percent this year and 3 percent-4
percent in 2014, Vasiliauskas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
