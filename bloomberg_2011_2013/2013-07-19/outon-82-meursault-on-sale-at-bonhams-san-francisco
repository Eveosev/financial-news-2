Vintage Bordeaux wines including a
case of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 1982, Burgundy from Meursault
and a range of Italian and Californian wines are among lots on
sale at a Bonhams auction in  San Francisco  later this month.  A 12-bottle case of Mouton 1982, a first-growth Pauillac
estate north of Bordeaux, is estimated to fetch as much as
$12,000. Among rarer Burgundies, a 12-bottle mixed lot of
Meursault from producer Pierre Morey, including eight bottles of
his Perrieres 1986, is estimated at as much as $1,400.  The auction comes as the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of top
Bordeaux vintages has risen 4 percent this year, with declines
since mid-March following a gain of 8 percent in the first 10
weeks of the year. Demand at auctions has been driven by older
Burgundy vintages, including at a Bonhams sale in London earlier
this month.  “There is a healthy appetite for wine from countries and
producers outside the long favored areas of Burgundy and
Bordeaux,” Richard Harvey, International Director of Bonhams
wine department, said in an e-mailed statement this week
following its July 11 sale.  At that auction, three bottles of Romanee-Conti 1999 were
the top lot, selling for 23,000 pounds ($35,100), while another
three-bottle lot of Romanee-Conti 1989 sold for 17,250 pounds.
The top Bordeaux in that sale was a case of Chateau Latour 1959,
which fetched 11,500 pounds.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
