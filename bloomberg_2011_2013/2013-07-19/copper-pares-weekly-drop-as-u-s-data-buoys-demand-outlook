Copper pared a weekly loss as
falling jobless claims, gains in regional manufacturing and
better-than-forecast company earnings bolstered the outlook for
the U.S., the second biggest user.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.9 percent to $6,970 a metric ton and
was at $6,931.75 at 11 a.m. in  Tokyo . The price has fallen 0.3
percent this week after gaining in the previous two weeks.  Claims for jobless benefits in the U.S. dropped to the
fewest since early May while the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s general economic index increased to 19.8, the
highest since March 2011, data released yesterday showed. Of the
82 Standard & Poor’s 500 members that have released earnings so
far this reporting season, 73 percent have topped analysts’
profit projections, and 52 percent have beaten on sales,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The U.S. economy is improving, supporting copper,” said
 Hiroyuki Kikukawa , the general manager of research at Nihon
Unicom Inc. in Tokyo. A gain in canceled warrants, or orders to
remove metal from LME warehouses, also boosted prices, he said.  Orders to remove copper from LME warehouses rose 1,325 tons
to 336,600 tons, compared with total stockpiles of 640,600 tons,
data from the bourse showed yesterday.  “The tightness in the spot market is suggesting that dips
should be bought,” said  Jonathan Barratt , the chief executive
officer of Barratt’s Bulletin in Sydney.  Copper for delivery in November on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed 0.6 percent to 49,970  yuan  ($8,138) a ton.
Futures for delivery in September on the Comex added 0.5 percent
to $3.1475 a pound.  On the LME, aluminum, nickel, lead and zinc also rose,
while tin declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
