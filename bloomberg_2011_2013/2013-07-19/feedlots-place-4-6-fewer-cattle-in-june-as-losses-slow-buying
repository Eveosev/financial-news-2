U.S. feedlots reduced the number of
cattle added to their herds by 4.6 percent in June as feed costs
eroded profits. Feedlots sold the fewest cattle for the month of
June since records started.  About 1.587 million  head  of cattle were moved into feedlots
last month, down from 1.664 million in June 2012, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today in a report. Twelve
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 5 percent
decline, on average. The feedlot herd totaled 10.4 million as of
July 1, down 3.2 percent from a year earlier. Analysts expected
a 3.1 percent decline.  Precipitation in late May and June encouraged some
producers to buy feeders and put them on grass instead of in
feedlots, according to Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois . Last
month, feedlots lost $171 a head, according to Rich Nelson,
chief strategist at Allendale, who cited USDA data. That’s the
26th straight month of losses, he said.  Placements declined on “the fact that feed costs actually
rose during that month of June, and the continued losses on
feedlot profitability,” Nelson said in a telephone interview.  Feedlot sales  Feedlot operators typically buy year-old cattle that weigh
about 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders.
The animals are fattened on corn until they weigh about 1,300
pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.895 million animals to meatpackers
last month, down 3.6 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
A USDA spokesman, talking to reporters shortly before the
numbers were released, said it was the lowest number sold in the
month of June since records started in 1996.  Analysts expected a 5.4 percent slide, on average. There
was one less weekday last month compared with June 2012.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose percent 1 percent
to $1.26475 a pound yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price was down 4.4 percent this year through
yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.7
percent to $1.52075 a pound yesterday, trimming the loss in 2013
to 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
