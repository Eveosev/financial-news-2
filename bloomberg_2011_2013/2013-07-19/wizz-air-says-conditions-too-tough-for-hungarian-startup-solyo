Jozsef Varadi, chief executive
officer of Wizz Air, Eastern  Europe ’s biggest budget carrier,
said it’s a bad time to establish a new Hungarian airline, days
after startup Solyom Airways announced plans for flights.  Solyom Air said this week it has leased six aircraft and
opened an office at Budapest airport as it works on plans to
fill a gap left by the collapse of flag-carrier Malev Zrt.  “There’s no growth in Europe and  oil prices  are near all-time highs,” Varadi said today in Budapest. “That affects
profitability and the amount of available funding.”  Malev, founded in 1946, ceased flying in February 2012 with
debts of 60 billion forint ($266 million) after the Hungarian
government became one of the first in Europe to decide it could
get by without a national carrier. Discount airlines led by Wizz
and  Ryanair Holdings Ltd. (RYA)  have filled the gap on the most viable
routes, though available connections remain below prior levels.  Varadi, who was previewing Wizz’s new Budapest-Moscow
route, which commences in September, declined to comment on a
potential initial public offering, calling reports of a planned
sale “press rumors.” The Budapest-based company will announce
such steps in time, should a decision be made, he said.  Wizz has appointed Barclays Plc., Citigroup Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. to prepare an IPO in  London , people
familiar with the matter said this month. The sale may happen as
early as the second half of this year, one of the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
