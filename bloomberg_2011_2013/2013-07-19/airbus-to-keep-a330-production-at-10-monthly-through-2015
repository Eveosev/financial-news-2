Airbus SAS (EAD)  plans to keep building
A330 twin-aisle airliners at a rate of 10 a month at least
through 2015 as customers including  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) 
expand the model’s role in their fleets.  Airbus, which handed over the 1,000th A330 to  Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  today, has a half dozen “major” sales
campaigns under way that can be expected to bring in new orders
to sustain output at record levels for years, Chief Operating
Officer  John Leahy  said.  “We’ll be in production until the next decade” amid
interest from “quite a few customers” among leasing companies
and airlines, Leahy told reporters after the delivery ceremony
today in Toulouse,  France .  Demand for the twin-engine, 300-seat plane, which entered
service in 1994, has benefited partly from delays in deliveries
of  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787 Dreamliner. Hong Kong-based Cathay started
flying its first A330 in 1995 and has come back nine times with
repeat orders. Toulouse-based Airbus’s backlog for A330s stands
at 246 planes, enough for two years of production.  Customers introducing the A330 to their fleets for the
first time this year include  Iberia (IAG) , Sichuan Airlines Co. and
 Cebu Air Inc. (CEB) , which has configured the planes with 436 seats,
the densest ever. The A330-300 variant generally seats 300
passengers and the A330-200 seats 246 in two classes.  Sales Thresholds  The A330 is Airbus’s first wide-body plane to break the
1,000-delivery mark, while Boeing has already reached the
threshold with its 767, 777 and 747 models. It’s the only wide-body to reach a construction rate of 10 planes a month, a figure
reached in April. Airbus has considered accelerating production
further, though has held back because of difficulties in getting
 China  to approve the building of planes already sold.  Orders for 27 planes from China for A330s are still in
limbo after the government there froze the contracts as part of
a campaign against a European Union proposal to tax  carbon
emissions . Of 45 originally frozen, 18 have been unblocked.  “We’re waiting patiently for the remainder” of contracts
to be released, Leahy said.  Tanker Version  The A330 is positioned as a potential replacement for aging
Boeing 777-200s, now out of production, and 767s, in competition
with the 787-8 and 787-9 variants of the Dreamliner that offer
longer ranges than the Airbus model. In addition to being
marketed as a passenger plane, the A330 is sold as a freighter
and also as a platform for mid-air refueling of combat jets.
About 28 airborne-tanker versions have been ordered, with 16
delivered.  Since the 787 first came on offer in early 2004, Airbus has
won orders for more than 800 A330s, Leahy said. The average
route flown by the A330-300 is 1,800 nautical miles, or about
two hours. The aircraft is used for flights as short as 30
minutes and as long as 14 hours.  Airbus plans to formally begin offering a regional variant
of the A330 later this year, a move that would lower acquisition
and maintenance costs by reducing engine thrust, cutting takeoff
weight.  “With lower thrusts, you don’t have to pay as much in
route charges, not as much for the engine, obviously, and you
have lower engine and airframe maintenance costs,” Leahy said.
“That would be good in  Southeast Asia  for regional flying, and
in markets like China.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
