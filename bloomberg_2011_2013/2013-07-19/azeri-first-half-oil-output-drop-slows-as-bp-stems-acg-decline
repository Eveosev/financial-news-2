Azerbaijan’s oil production decline
slowed in the first half of the year after  BP Plc (BP/)  halted an
output slump at the country’s largest deposit.  The Caspian Sea nation pumped 21.8 million metric tons of
crude during the period, down 1.8 percent from a year earlier,
according to data published yesterday on the website of the
State Statistics Committee, based in the capital, Baku. That
compares with a 7.1 percent drop a year earlier.  Marketable natural gas output rose during the period to 8.9
billion cubic meters from 8.8 billion cubic meters a year
earlier, the committee said.  Production at the BP-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field
stabilized at an average 666,000 barrels a day in January
through June, BP regional manager Gordon Birrell said last
month. The offshore deposit, known as ACG, saw production drop
12 percent in the first half of last year, drawing criticism of
BP from Azeri President Ilham Aliyev.  ACG cut production 7 percent last year to 32.9 million
tons, or 77 percent of the country’s total output. Partners in
the project include State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, known as Socar,
 Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)   Output in Azerbaijan, the largest oil producer in the
former Soviet Union after Russia and Kazakhstan, peaked at 51
million tons in 2010. The country pumped 43 million tons last
year and 46 million tons in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
