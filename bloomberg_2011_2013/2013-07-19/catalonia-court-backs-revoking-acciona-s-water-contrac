The top court in Catalonia backed a
panel’s decision to revoke a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion)
contract with  Acciona SA (ANA)  to privatize Barcelona’s water supply.  The Superior Court ruling sides with Sociedad General de
Aguas de Barcelona’s challenge to nullify Catalonia’s contract
awarded to an Acciona-led group late last year and urged the
regional government to call for a new bidding process, court
documents show. A spokesman for Acciona declined to comment
today.  Acciona, along  Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11) , has effectively managed
the city’s water since Jan. 1 and said its offer met all legal
requirements in April. The Alcobendas, Spain-based company also
has said it would seek a full refund for about 299 million euros
of payments made to regional authorities should the contract be
canceled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
