Manchester United manager David Moyes said his club is “trying very hard” to make squad
additions and he hopes to have more information about its bid to
sign Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas over the weekend.  Moyes, speaking at a news conference in Sydney today on the
eve of United’s pre-season game against the A-League All Stars,
said Chief Executive Officer Ed Woodward is handling
negotiations to acquire the former Arsenal captain.  “I’m in contact with the chief exec who’s been dealing
with it just now,” Moyes said. “I might have a little bit more
information in the next day or so about how it’s going.”  Moyes, who replaced the retired Alex Ferguson as United
manager, repeated his previous remarks that striker Wayne Rooney
is not for sale. Chelsea said two days ago it had made a written
offer to United for the transfer of the  England  forward.  “The club’s position hasn’t changed on Wayne Rooney,”
Moyes added. “As far as players we’re looking to bring in,
we’re working hard to do that. Hopefully there will be some good
news in the not too distant future.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
