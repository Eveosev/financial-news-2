Gasoline jumped to the highest in
four months on speculation that refinery shutdowns in  Canada  and
Philadelphia may crimp  New York  Harbor supply.  Futures rose as much as 1.7 percent as Philadelphia Energy
Solutions’ refinery idled an alkylation unit, which might affect
the fluid catalytic cracker. Korea National Oil Corp.’s Come by
Chance refinery in Newfoundland shut units for repair. Irving
Oil Corp., an exporter to the U.S. Northeast, has idled multiple
units, including two catalytic crackers, at its St. John,  New
Brunswick , plant, according to Genscape Inc., a Louisville,
Kentucky-based energy information provider.  “The alky at Philadelphia Energy Solutions is impacting
gas production and, generally, you have to cut back the cat as
well,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston. “Irving has been a significant buyer of gasoline
for resupply and the cat crackers and the crude units could be
down for several weeks.”  August-delivery gasoline rose 3.88 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $3.1486 a gallon at 10:23 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  on trading volume that was 18 percent above the 100-day
average for the time of day. Prices touched $3.1632, the highest
intraday price since March 15 and are up 0.9 percent this week.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened $1.279 to
$23.851 a barrel, after dropping 12 percent yesterday. The
fuel’s  premium  to Brent gained $1.344 to $20.53.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose an 11th consecutive
time, gaining 0.3 cent to $3.67 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website. That’s the highest level
since March 22.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for August delivery rose 0.72 cent,
or 0.2 percent, to $3.1079 a gallon on volume that was 3.6
percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
sank 4.8 cents to $22.142 a barrel. The  premium over Brent 
increased 19.9 cents to $21.712.  To contact the reporter on this story:
