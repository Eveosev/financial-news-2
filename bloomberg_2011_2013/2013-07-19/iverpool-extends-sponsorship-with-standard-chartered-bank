Liverpool added two years onto its
sponsorship agreement with Standard Chartered Bank, taking the
Premier League soccer club’s contract through the end of the
2015-16 season.  The bank took over the jersey sponsorship in July 2010.
Financial terms weren’t released in a statement on Liverpool’s
website.  “Liverpool are hugely popular in the markets where we do
business, and we are excited about the opportunity to continue
to work with this fantastic club and their passionate fans,”
said  Peter Sands , group chief executive of Standard Chartered
Plc.  Liverpool, which finished seventh in the league last
season, is on a tour of  Asia , playing in Jakarta, Melbourne and
Bangkok.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
