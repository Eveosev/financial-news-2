U.S. stocks  rose for a fourth week
as companies reported higher-than-estimated earnings and Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank’s asset
purchases are not on a preset course.  Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley rallied more than
5.6 percent for the week to pace an advance among financial
shares.  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , the biggest U.S. Web portal,  gained  6.9
percent after analysts raised estimates on the value of its
stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
Technology stocks had the worst performance among 10 groups in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as Google Inc. and Microsoft
Corp. tumbled at least 2.9 percent on disappointing earnings.  The S&P 500  advanced  0.7 percent to a record 1,692.09 over
the five days, extending its rally for the year to 19 percent.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 79.44 points, or 0.5
percent, to 15,543.74. Both gauges on July 18 surpassed their
previous intraday record highs, set on May 22.  “Bernanke has been on a heavy communications circuit mode
to make it clear that the Fed will remain flexible in its policy
approach,” Tim Leach, who manages $112 billion as the San
Francisco-based chief investment officer of U.S. Bank Wealth
Management, said by phone. “Earnings are well supported going
forward by economic activity and strong corporate balance
sheets.”  Stocks rallied as Bernanke told the House Financial
Services Committee on July 17 that the central bank’s bond
purchases could be reduced more quickly or expanded as economic
conditions warrant. He said the next day it is “way too early
to make any judgment” as to whether policy makers will start
tapering purchases in September.  Timing Debate  Central bank policy makers have been debating the timing
and pace of any cuts in the central bank’s $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases. Monetary stimulus has helped fuel a
 surge  in stocks worldwide, with the  S&P 500  jumping 150 percent
from its March 2009 low.  Equities also gained during the week as reports suggested
continued improvement in the economy and corporate earnings.
U.S. industrial production rose in June by the most in four
months, while fewer Americans than forecast filed applications
for  unemployment benefits  in the latest week.  Of the 103 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported
earnings so far, 73 percent have topped analysts’  estimates ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About 53 percent have
beaten revenue projections. About 157 S&P 500 companies are
scheduled to release quarterly results in the coming week.  ETF Flows  Investors have increasingly turned to stocks this month, as
U.S. equity exchange-traded funds are getting money at the
fastest rate since September 2008. About $27.9 billion was sent
to American share ETFs in the last 13 days, about four times the
amount deposited last month and the most in almost five years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg from about 1,500 funds.  “We’re seeing a broad-based move that retail investors are
coming into the market,” Vincent Lowry, chief executive officer
of VTL Associates in Philadelphia, said in a phone interview.
The firm has $1.3 billion under management. “I do believe the
equity markets are the place to be because they will be able to
absorb any gradual increase in  interest rates .”  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of protecting against swings on the S&P 500,
dropped 9.4 percent to 12.54 for its fourth  weekly retreat . The
VIX is at its lowest level since May 17, five days before
Bernanke signaled the central bank could start scaling back
monetary stimulus.  Bank Earnings  Industrial stocks, energy companies and utilities climbed
at least 1.9 percent as seven of 10 industry groups in the S&P
500 rose for the week.  The KBW Bank Index added 2.4 percent to the highest level
since October 2008 as earnings from lenders beat estimates. Bank
of America climbed 7 percent to $14.75 as the second-biggest
U.S. lender topped profit predictions on the strength of cost-cutting and better credit.  Morgan Stanley jumped 5.6 percent to $27.60 after net
income increased 66 percent as trading revenue rose and the
profit margin at its wealth-management unit climbed. The firm
also said it will buy back $500 million in stock.  Earnings among financial companies in the S&P 500 have
outperformed the index average, with 80 percent of the firms
surpassing estimates. The group’s results have exceeded
forecasts by an average of 8.7 percent.  Banks and insurers are predicted to report earnings growth
of 26 percent this quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Excluding financial stocks, analysts forecast S&P 500 companies
will report a 2 percent drop in profit, the data show.  Alibaba’s Value  Yahoo climbed 6.9 percent to $29.11 as earnings beat
analysts’  estimates . Alibaba may be worth as much as $101
billion after Yahoo said the Chinese company’s profit tripled in
the first three months of the year, according to Sameet Sinha,
an analyst at B. Riley & Co.  Leap Wireless International Inc. more than doubled to
$17.39. AT&T, the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier, agreed
to acquire the company for $1.2 billion, giving the company 5
million customers, more airwaves and a larger piece of the pay-as-you-go market. AT&T was unchanged at $35.81.  Johnson Controls Inc. climbed 11 percent, the  most  in the
S&P 500, to $40.95. The largest U.S. auto-parts maker will sell
its HomeLink line of installed garage-door openers to Gentex
Corp. for $700 million as it seeks a buyer for the rest of its
automotive electronics unit.  Customer Spending  Schlumberger Ltd. increased 7.7 percent to $82.74. The
largest oilfield-services provider, will buy back $10 billion in
shares as quarterly profit rose and it forecast “double-digit”
customer spending increases on crude exploration.  Technology shares sank 1.8 percent as a  group , the most
among 10 industries in the S&P 500 as companies missed
forecasts. The 17 technology companies in the S&P 500 that have
reported earnings have missed estimates by an average 3.6
percent. The average result for all companies in the index has
come in 2.7 percent above forecasts, the data show.  Intel Corp . dropped 3.6 percent to $23.04. The world’s
largest semiconductor maker forecast sales for the current
period that may fall short of some analysts’ estimates as a
slump in the personal-computer market erodes its largest
business.  Google retreated 2.9 percent to $896.60. The company posted
second-quarter earnings that missed projections as mobile
advertising crimped average prices.  Microsoft plunged 12 percent, the most since 2009, to
$31.40 for the biggest slide in the Dow. The company’s fourth-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates by the biggest margin
in at least a decade, depressed by weakening demand for PCs
running Windows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
