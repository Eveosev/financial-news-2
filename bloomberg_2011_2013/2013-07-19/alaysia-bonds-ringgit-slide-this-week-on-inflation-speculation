Malaysia’s 10-year bonds declined
this week, driving the yield to a two-year high, as economists
predicted data today would show inflation accelerated in June.  The yield on the 3.48 percent notes due March 2023 rose 13
basis points to 3.83 percent as of 5:30 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur ,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. It earlier reached 3.85 percent,
the highest for a  benchmark  security since July 2011. Consumer
prices  climbed  1.8 percent, less than the median estimate for a
1.9 percent increase in a Bloomberg survey and the same rate as
the previous month. That’s still the highest since April 2012.  Bonds fell along with the ringgit this week on lingering
concern the  Federal Reserve  will rein in monetary stimulus
that’s spurred demand for emerging-market assets. Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said yesterday that the central bank intends to keep
its policy “highly accommodative for the foreseeable future.”
A report yesterday also showed jobless claims in the U.S.
dropped to the least since early May.  “Bonds are being sold because the expectation is that
local inflation will continue to inch up,” said Yeah Kim Leng,
chief economist at RAM Holdings Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The
improvement in the  U.S. economy  also doesn’t help.”  The government sold 4 billion ringgit ($1.3 billion) of
Islamic debt due 2016 at auction today to yield 3.389 percent,
with demand exceeding the amount on offer by 2.9 times,
according to data published on the central bank’s website.  The ringgit dropped 0.5 percent to 3.1923 per dollar this
week and touched 3.2053 today, the lowest level since July 9,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, declined 46 basis points, or 0.46
percentage point, to 7.5 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
