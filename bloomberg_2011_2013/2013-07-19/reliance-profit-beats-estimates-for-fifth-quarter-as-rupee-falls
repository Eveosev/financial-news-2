Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) ’s profit
beat analyst estimates for the fifth straight quarter as the
rupee’s plunge to a record boosted dollar-denominated earnings
at the operator of the world’s biggest oil refinery complex.  Net income  rose 19 percent to 53.5 billion rupees ($900
million), or 16.60 rupees a share, in the three months ended
June 30 from 45 billion rupees, or 13.80 rupees, a year earlier,
the Mumbai-based company said yesterday in a filing. That
exceeded the 52.5 billion rupee median  estimate  of 36 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales fell 4.6 percent to 876.5 billion
rupees.  Reliance, which produces natural gas from  India ’s biggest
deposit, will also benefit from higher prices starting April
next year as Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s administration
seeks to cut imports by boosting the nation’s output from local
fields. Reliance’s billionaire Chairman  Mukesh Ambani , 56, told
shareholders last month he plans to spend 1.5 trillion rupees
over the next three years to expand businesses ranging from gas
to telecommunications.  “The rupee gains pushed up other income and that probably
helped beat estimates,” said Kamlesh Kotak, Mumbai-based head
of research at Asian Market Securities Pvt. “Things are in
place for them the next few quarters and the gas price increase
from next year will benefit them some more.”  The  shares  increased 0.7 percent to 923.70 rupees, the
highest since June 2011, in Mumbai yesterday. The stock has
gained 10 percent this year, compared with the 3.7 percent
increase in the benchmark  S&P BSE Sensex (SENSEX)  index. The earnings
were announced after the close of trading.  Lower Spending  Reliance, which cut spending 5.5 percent to 827.1 billion
rupees in the quarter, earned $8.40 for every barrel of crude it
processed, compared with $7.60 a barrel a year earlier and
$10.10 a barrel in the preceding three months. Profit from
turning Dubai crude into diesel in  Singapore , an Asian benchmark,
averaged $16.26 a barrel, compared with $16.06 a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Other income increased 33 percent to 25.4 billion rupees in
the quarter from 19 billion rupees a year earlier on sale of
investments, the company said.  Reliance’s two refineries at Jamnagar in the western state
of Gujarat can process a combined 1.24 million barrels of crude
daily. The plants are capable of turning heavier oil grades,
which are typically cheaper, into high-value fuels.  Brent crude , a benchmark oil price used by much of the
world, averaged $103.35 a barrel in the three months ended June
30, compared with $108.76 a year ago.  Dollar Sales  Much of the output from the refineries are exported and
sold in the U.S. currency. A stronger dollar increases
Reliance’s earnings in rupees. The company is India’s biggest
exporter, accounting for 14 percent of total shipments, Ambani
said at the  shareholders’ meeting  June 6. Reliance also sells
its gas in India in dollars.  The rupee fell 8.6 percent in the quarter ended June 30,
making it the worst performer among  Asia ’s major currencies. It
touched an unprecedented low of 61.2 against the dollar July 8.  Reliance had debt outstanding of 803.1 billion rupees as of
June 30, compared with 725.3 billion rupees on March 31, the
company said. Cash and equivalents held in banks, mutual funds
and  government securities  totaled 930.7 billion rupees.  Gas Price  India’s cabinet agreed on June 27 to increase the price of
natural gas as it seeks to augment exploration of the clean-burning fuel. The new rates will be effective April 1, 2014, as
a weighted average traded gas prices in the U.S. and U.K. and
imports by Japan and India in 2013, Oil Secretary Vivek Rae said.
The price may be as high as $8 per million British thermal units
next year from $4.2 per million Btu now, he said.  The higher price will increase Reliance’s earnings per
share by 5.3 rupees at the current rate of output, according to
Niraj Mansingka and Kiran Tulasi, Mumbai-based analysts at
Edelweiss Securities Ltd. A higher price may also help the
company increase production that has declined for three years.  Gas production from its biggest block in India, KG-D6 in
the  Bay of Bengal , fell 53 percent to 49.2 billion cubic feet in
the quarter from a year earlier, Reliance said. Oil production
from the block dropped 41 percent to 500,000 barrels.  Reliance has been selling the gas at $4.2 per million Btu
since it started production in April 2009.  The company also operates retail stores that sell fruits
and clothes and is planning to start a fourth-generation
telecommunications service. Revenue at the retail business grew
53 percent to 34.7 billion rupees in the quarter. The unit,
which was started in 2006, reported its first profit in the
fiscal year ended March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
