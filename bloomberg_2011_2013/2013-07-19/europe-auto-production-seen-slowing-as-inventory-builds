European automakers will probably
slow production this quarter to shed inventory that’s building
as output exceeds vehicle purchases,  Honeywell International
Inc. (HON)  Chief Financial Officer Dave Anderson said.  European registrations of new cars and light trucks are
lagging behind production by as much as 2 percentage points
since the beginning of the year, leading to an “inevitable
correction,” he said in a telephone interview yesterday.  “It’s not significantly greater than demand, but we think
it’s enough that there will be some correction,” Anderson said.
“The correction will most likely occur through the summer
plant-down schedules that would be in the third quarter.”  European vehicle sales have declined as the region’s
economy slumps, unemployment remains high and governments
struggle to rein in spending. In June, total new-car
registrations fell 6.3 percent from a year earlier to 1.18
million, the lowest for the month since 1996.  Honeywell expects sales for its transportation unit, which
supplies turbochargers mostly to European automakers, to rise 2
percent to 4 percent this quarter, less than the 5.2 percent
increase to $947 million for the second quarter. The second-quarter sales growth was the unit’s first since 2011’s final
three months as the decline in European Union vehicle production
narrowed to 1 percent.  The company expects slower growth for the transportation
unit this quarter “because we think there’s an inevitable
inventory correction that’s going to occur,” Anderson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
