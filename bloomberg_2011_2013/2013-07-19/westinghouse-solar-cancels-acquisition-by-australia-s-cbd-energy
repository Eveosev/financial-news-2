Westinghouse Solar Inc. (WEST)  canceled an
agreement to be acquired by Australia’s  CBD Energy Ltd. (CBD)  after
the deal was “repeatedly delayed.”  Westinghouse terminated the deal yesterday and is now
focused on “rebuilding its core business,” according to a
filing today from the Campbell, California-based company.  Westinghouse, which designs and installs residential and
commercial solar systems, agreed to be acquired by CBD in May
2012, a deal that would have given the Australian company access
to the U.S. market. The acquisition was initially set to close
in the third quarter of last year.  Delays in completing the deal have “resulted in a
disruption” in Westinghouse’s relationships with suppliers and
led to a “significant decline” in revenue, according to the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
