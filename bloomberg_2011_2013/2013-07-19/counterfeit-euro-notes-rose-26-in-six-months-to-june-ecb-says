The  European Central Bank  withdrew
317,000 counterfeit euro bank notes from circulation in the
first half of 2013, an increase of 26.3 percent from the same
period last year.  The region’s 20-euro ($2.63) and 50-euro notes were the
most counterfeited, accounting for 82.1 percent of the total,
the bank said in an e-mailed statement today. Forged 100-euro
notes accounted for 12.4 percent of the total. About 98.5
percent of the fake currency was found in euro-area countries.  “While there has been an increase in counterfeits
discovered in the first half of 2013, the number of counterfeits
recovered in 2012 was particularly low and the latest figure is
comparable with levels seen in previous years,” the ECB said in
the statement. The number of genuine bank notes in circulation
is 15.1 billion, it said.  The Bundesbank said today that the number of fake notes
withdrawn in  Germany  fell to 19,472 in the first half of this
year, down 13.6 percent from the same period in 2012. The losses
caused by forgeries amounted to less than 1.1 million euros, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
