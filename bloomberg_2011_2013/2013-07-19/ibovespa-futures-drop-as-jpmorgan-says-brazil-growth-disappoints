Ibovespa  futures  dropped, a sign the
stock gauge may pare its biggest weekly gain in 10 months, as
JPMorgan Chase & Co. reaffirmed its sell recommendation on
Brazilian equities, citing “disappointing” growth.  MPX Energia SA (MPXE3) , the energy company controlled by
billionaire  Eike Batista , may be active after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. recommended buying the stock. Homebuilder  Helbor
Empreendimentos SA (HBOR3)  may move after saying booked sales dropped 20
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August fell 0.4
percent to 47,330 at 9:21 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The gauge is up 4.7
percent this week, the most since the week ending on Sept. 14.
The real climbed 0.2 percent to 2.2233 per dollar.  “Disappointment remains the norm” when it comes to
Brazil’s growth outlook, JPMorgan strategist Emy Shayo wrote in
a note to clients today. “We don’t expect much improvement
going forward as neither the global scenario nor the local
economic policy guidance is likely to change.”  Analysts covering  Brazil  have reduced their 2013 growth
forecast for nine straight weeks, most recently cutting it to
2.31 percent in a bank survey of about 100 economists released
earlier this week.  The Ibovespa has slumped 22 percent this year through
yesterday, wiping out $230 billion from the  value  of Brazilian
equities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil’s main
equity gauge trades at 11.9 times analysts’  earnings estimates 
for the next four quarters, compared with 10.3 for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 5.91 billion
reais yesterday, which compares with a daily average of 7.78
billion reais this year through July 17, according to data
 compiled  by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
