The Armenian capital of Yerevan is
getting a water-supply and network infrastructure improvement
loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  The EBRD said 5.4 million euros ($7.1 million) in financing
will allow Yerevan Djur CJSC, a unit of  Europe ’s largest water
company  Veolia Environnement (VIE) , to implement project upgrades
including pipe replacements and reduce water losses in the city
of 1.1 million residents. Yerevan Djur will also install new
water meters for households, the bank said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
