Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy arrived in Phnom Penh nine days before a national
election, ending a four-year exile after receiving a royal
pardon for charges he says were politically motivated.  Thousands of cheering supporters greeted Sam Rainsy, who
stood on a makeshift stage at the airport to greet the crowd,
according to live footage on his Cambodia National Rescue
Party’s  website . The former finance minister has lived abroad
since 2009 to avoid jail time for falsifying maps and inciting
racial discrimination.  King Norodom Sihamoni pardoned Sam Rainsy last week
following a request from Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled
the country in various coalitions since 1985. Cambodians will
pick a new parliament on July 28.  Sam Rainsy’s return may boost the prospects of his
political party, which was formed a year ago to unite the main
opposition groups. He is banned from running as a candidate in
the election.  Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party won 90 of 123 seats in
an election in 2008 that was described by the U.S. as an
“improvement” over previous votes despite some flaws. The
party is set to win again even though the opposition is poised
to take more seats, government spokesman  Phay Siphan  said on
July 12.  Cambodia’s economy grew 7.2 percent last year on higher
consumption and investment, the  Asian Development Bank  said in
April. Gross domestic product is forecast to expand at the same
pace this year and 7.5 percent in 2014 as the U.S. and  Europe 
buy more Cambodia-made garments and footwear, the  ADB  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
