Buyout firm Cinven Group Ltd. agreed
to acquire Anglo-German Internet domain and hosting company Host
Europe Group Ltd. from Montagu Private Equity LLP.  Cinven will pay 438 million pounds ($667 million) for the
company, or 13.8 times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, Montagu’s financial adviser, UBS
AG, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Montagu bought Host Europe in October 2010 from Oakley
Capital Private Equity LP in a deal that valued the business at
222 million pounds, according to a  statement  on London-based
Montagu’s  website .  The company, which is based in Uxbridge,  England , and has
600 employees with operations in the U.K.,  Germany  and  Spain ,
offers its 1.5 million customers domain registration as well as
shared and managed hosting for their activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
