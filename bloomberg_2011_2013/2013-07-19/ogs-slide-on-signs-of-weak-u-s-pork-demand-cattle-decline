Hog futures declined on signs of
slowing U.S. pork demand. Cattle prices also fell.  Wholesale- pork  prices were down 2.7 percent this week
through yesterday, headed for the third straight decline, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. That would be the longest
slump since September. Meatpackers processed 1.607 million hogs
in the first four days of this week, down 0.6 percent from the
same period a week earlier, government data show.  Futures are “weaker right now because of the cash market
and product trade,” Chad Henderson, a market analyst at Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in
a telephone interview. “It’s the weaker demand.”  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.4 percent to 85.3
cents a pound at 9:22 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
trimming this week’s gain to 1.3 percent.  Longer term, prices have “significant downside” as
cheaper feed costs may cause hog weights to “surge higher and
put extra tonnage on the market,” Henderson said. The USDA said
July 11 that the domestic corn harvest may reach a record 13.95
billion bushels.  Cattle futures for October delivery slid 0.2 percent to
$1.26275 a pound in Chicago.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.3
percent to $1.52475 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
