The Bundesbank said the number of
counterfeit euro banknotes removed from circulation in  Germany

down 13.6 percent from the first six months of last year, it
said in a statement today. The losses caused by forgeries
amounted to less than 1.1 million euros ($1.4 million), it said.  The Bundesbank said it removed 28,438 coins from
circulation, compared with approximately 29,500 in the first six
months of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
