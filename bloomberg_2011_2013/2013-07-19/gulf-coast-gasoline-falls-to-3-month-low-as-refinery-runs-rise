Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened to a
three-month low as refineries in the area increased rates to
near record highs, boosting supplies of the fuel to the most
since February.  Refinery inputs  in the PADD 3 rose by 59,000 barrels to
8.67 million barrels a day last week, Energy Information
Administration data show. Plants processed an all-time high 8.69
million barrels a day of crude and other feedstocks in the week
ended June 28.  Gasoline supplies  on the Gulf Coast grew by 2.06
million barrels to 78.2 million, the highest level since the
week of Feb. 8.  Conventional 87-octane gasoline  weakened by 1 cent to a
discount of 19.25 cents a gallon to futures traded on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:20 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the largest discount since April 10.
Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
slipped 0.5 cent to a 26-cent discount.  CBOB in  Chicago  sank 2 cents to 14 cents below futures.
Gasoline in the  mid-continent , or Group 3 region, weakened by 4
cents a gallon to a 13.25-cents-a-gallon discount.  August-September  Gasoline also weakened as the the premium for August-delivery futures to the September contract widened 0.04 cent to
6.53 cents a gallon. The spread was 1.8 cents a gallon July 1.  “Gasoline is just going to have a tough go of it as long
as the August-September RBOB spread stays wide,” said Steve Mosby, president of ADMO Energy LLC in  Kansas City ,  Missouri .  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , slipped 36 cents to $14.46 a barrel.  The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil retreated 36
cents to $7.96 a barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
