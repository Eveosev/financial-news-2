Oil and gas  rigs  in the U.S. rose by
11 to 1,770 this week, according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  rose four to 1,395, the Houston-based field
services company said on its website. Gas rigs increased by
seven to 369.  The total U.S. count has gained three weeks in a row.
Rising output from shale formations such as  North Dakota ’s
Bakken and  Texas ’s Eagle Ford plays have boosted domestic oil
production to the highest level since December 1990. The surge
in output helped the nation meet 89 percent of its own energy
needs in March.  Natural gas for August delivery fell 2.4 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.788 per million British thermal units at 1:17
p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , up 26 percent from a
year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  gained 58 billion cubic feet in the
week ended July 12 to 2.745 trillion, the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
yesterday. Supplies were 13 percent below year-earlier levels.  U.S. oil output climbed 1.2 percent to 7.49 million barrels
a day last week, EIA data show. Stockpiles fell 1.9 percent to
367 million barrels.  Crude for August delivery fell 4 cents to $108 a barrel
today on the Nymex, up 17 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
