Rubber was set for the largest
weekly gain 10 as oil climbed and a weakening Japanese yen
improved the appeal of yen-denominated contracts.  Rubber for delivery in December on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange surged as much as 5.8 percent, the biggest advance for
a most-active contract since May 10, to 262 yen a kilogram
($2,609 a metric ton), before trading at 256.2 yen at 10:46 a.m.
local time. Futures gained 7.5 percent this week, also the most
since the seven days ended May 10.  The yen extended losses against major currencies this week
ahead of elections in Japan, weakening as much as 0.4 percent to
100.87 per dollar. Crude oil held near a 16-month high after
employment data and company earnings burnished the U.S. economic
outlook.  “Futures in Tokyo tracked a rally in oil and got a boost
from the weaker yen,” said Hideshi Matsunaga, analyst at broker
ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo. “Gains in Shanghai’s rubber market also
eased concern that China’s slowdown will curb demand.”  The economy was stable in the first half and the government
can achieve major economic development goals this year,  China
Central Television  reported yesterday, citing Premier  Li Keqiang .  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 1.7 percent to 18,650  yuan  ($3,037) a ton.  Thai rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 78.85 baht
($2.53) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
