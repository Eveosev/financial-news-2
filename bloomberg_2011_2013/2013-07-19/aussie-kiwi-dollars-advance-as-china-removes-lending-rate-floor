Australia’s dollar strengthened
after the People’s Bank of China said it would remove the floor
on lending rates offered by financial institutions, boosting
optimism Chinese growth will support the economy.  New Zealand’s currency jumped to a one-month high against
its U.S. counterpart after the announcement, which gives Chinese
lenders more freedom to set borrowing costs and builds on
pledges by Premier  Li Keqiang  to expand an overhaul of interest
rates. China will also remove the cap on lending rates offered
by rural cooperatives, according to a statement on the PBOC’s
website. The moves are effective tomorrow.  “It is more liberalization, more of what’s been promised
and that can only be a good thing,” said  Neil Mellor , a
currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London. “The
Australian dollar particularly has been seen as a proxy trade
for the  yuan  because of the close ties between the two
countries.”  The Aussie dollar advanced 0.4 percent to 92.10 U.S. cents
at 12:53 p.m. London time. It gained versus all of its 16 major
peers except the kiwi and South African rand. New Zealand’s
currency rose 0.7 percent to 79.58 U.S. cents after
strengthening to 79.91, the most since June 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
