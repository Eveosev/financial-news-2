Roger Gifford,  Lord Mayor  of the
 City of London , said the U.K. capital is working to maintain its
attractiveness as a base for financial firms amid efforts to
overhaul the country’s banking regulations. He spoke in an
interview in Mexico City on July 18.  On whether he has seen evidence regulation has deterred
financial firms from  London :  “You need to look at each individual sector. So, for
instance, in asset management we’ve seen substantial numbers of
funds coming to London. The insurance market hasn’t been
affected at all. And let’s remember that most of the market
isn’t banking: it’s insurance, asset management, commodities,
maritime, law, and accounting. So if you just take that one
sector, banking, no we haven’t, but I think there’s definitely a
threat.”  “It’s not that people are moving away, but I think new
investment decisions are looking more broadly than they did
before. We’re very concerned that companies who are looking to
invest in a new lending operation or a new retail operation,
that they still think of the U.K. as a very attractive place to
come. So we’re working hard to keep the place looking good and
looking attractive.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
