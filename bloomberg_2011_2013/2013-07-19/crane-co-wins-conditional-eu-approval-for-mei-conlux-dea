Crane Co. (CR) , the maker of plane parts,
pumps and composite materials, won European Union antitrust
approval to buy MEI Conlux Holdings (U.S.) Inc. for about $820
million to add machines for handling bank notes.  The clearance is conditional upon the divestment of a
banknote recycler and acceptor product line in  Canada  and a coin
changer product line Germany, the European Commission said in an
e-mailed statement.  Crane also pledged not to close the acquisition before it
reaches a binding agreement for the sale of the divestment
businesses to a suitable purchaser approved by the EUâ€™s
antitrust authority, according to the commission.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
