South African President  Jacob Zuma 
will host a meeting of regional leaders tomorrow to review
preparations for Zimbabwe’s July 31 elections.  Presidents from Namibia, Mozambique and Tanzania will
attend the summit in the capital, Pretoria, Nelson Kgwete, a
spokesman for South Africa’s Department of International
Relations and Cooperation, said today by phone.  The leaders are meeting as representatives of the Southern
African Development Community, the 15-nation regional bloc that
brokered a power-sharing government between Zimbabwean President
 Robert Mugabe  and  Morgan Tsvangirai , then the opposition leader,
following a disputed vote in 2008. Tsvangirai, who’s now prime
minister, failed in a bid to postpone the presidential and
parliamentary elections scheduled for the end of the month.  Mugabe will rig the vote and is prepared to hold on to
power by any means, Tsvangirai told the London-based Daily
Telegraph newspaper on July 17. Mugabe threatened on July 5 to
withdraw Zimbabwe from SADC if it did anything “stupid” during
or after the election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
