The zloty strengthened for a seventh
day after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  eased concern
this week that cuts in U.S. stimulus were imminent.  Poland’s currency gained 0.2 percent to a one-month high of
4.2350 against the euro at 6:43 p.m. in Warsaw. The seven-day
advance was the longest run of gains since July 2010. The yield
on 10-year government notes fell for a second day, dropping six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.88 percent.  Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that
it was “way too early to make any judgment” on starting to taper
Fed bond buying in September. The zloty jumped 1.4 percent this
week, its biggest weekly gain in 10 months.  “The dovish voice from the Fed was the main driver of the
zloty’s appreciation this week,” Marcin Turkiewicz, a foreign-currency trader at BRE Bank SA in Warsaw, said by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
