Palm oil fell on speculation that
the beginning of the high-output cycle in  Malaysia  may lead to a
build-up of stockpiles in the world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for delivery in October dropped as much as 0.7
percent to 2,275 ringgit ($711) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, and was at 2,290 ringgit at the close of
the morning session in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures are set to drop 0.5
percent this week. Palm for local physical delivery in August
was at 2,340 ringgit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Global supplies of vegetable oils are poised to expand in
the 2013-2014 season starting Oct. 1, as production from palm
climbs to a record and output from soybeans and sunflower seed
jumps, according to Oil World. Malaysia’s palm oil output may
exceed 19 million tons this year, more than the record 18.9
million tons in 2011, Alvin Tai and Hoe Lee Leng, analysts at
RHB Investment Bank Bhd., wrote in a report today.  “With the high-crop season already here, we believe the
crude  palm oil  price will remain low,” said Tai and Hoe,
referring to the July-October period when output is typically
the highest every year. “Despite the healthy production, we do
not think that there will be an oversupply situation serious
enough to cause another price crash this year.”  Global production of palm oil may rise 4.4 percent to a
58.2 million tons from the previous season amid higher supplies
from top growers Indonesia and Malaysia, the Hamburg-based
researcher Oil World said July 16. Reserves in Malaysia dropped
37 percent to 1.65 million tons in June from a record in
December, according to the country’s palm oil board.  Soybean oil  for delivery in December was little changed at
45.41 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in November gained 0.5 percent to $12.7175 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery declined 0.3 percent
to 5,626  yuan  ($916) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil lost 0.4 percent to 7,242 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
