Telkom SA SOC Ltd. (TKG) ,  Africa ’s largest
fixed-line operator, may be frustrating attempts by the
Solidarity labor union to ballot its members on a strike by
restricting electronic communication, the union said.  Solidarity, which represents about 3,000 Telkom employees,
is trying to e-mail its members on their Telkom work addresses
to vote on accepting a wage offer made by the Pretoria-based
telecommunications company or going on strike. The messages are
being returned to the sender, said the union, which showed some
of the blocked e-mails to Bloomberg. Telkom denied preventing
the communication deliberately.  “Telkom is blocking our electronic communication to
members,” spokesman Marius Croucamp said in a text message
today.  Strike action is looming for Telkom after a breakdown in
negotiations about wage increases. Pynee Chetty, a spokesman for
Telkom, said the company had investigated the complaint and had
concluded it was a technical issue with Solidarity’s e-mail
system.  “We categorically deny sabotaging any of the unions
communications,” Chetty said by phone. “We believe it’s in the
best interests of our employees to receive communications from
the organized labor outfits that they subscribe to.”  Early votes received by Solidarity showed that a majority
of those members polled so far have rejected the pay offer,
Croucamp said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
