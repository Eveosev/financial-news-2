President Vladimir Putin advised
critics of  Russia ’s performance at the World University Games,
where it finished first with six times as many  gold medals  as
 China , to try the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.  “I’d like to advise them to take up sports and go see a
doctor if they have any health issues,” Putin, 60, told
reporters near Moscow today when asked about criticism that
Russia fielded Olympic medal winners at the games organized for
university athletes. “At the end of the day, maybe they should
try Viagra. Then life would improve, reveal some of its bright,
beautiful sides, and they would see the future.”  Russia’s record haul at the  Kazan Universiade games , which
ended on July 17, put the spotlight on its use of 18 gold-medal
winners from the Olympics, according to the  New York  Times. The
performance was ridiculed by Russian media including the
Vedomosti business newspaper, which said the lopsided results
turned the competition into the “ massacre of the innocents .”  The Russians ended the 11 days of competition in Kazan, the
capital of Tatarstan on the Volga river, with 155 gold medals
under their belt. China was second with 26 golds, followed by
 Japan  with 24.  Putin is a black belt in judo known for physical stunts
such as riding a horse bare-chested, shooting a tiger with a
tranquilizer gun and piloting a plane dousing water over
wildfires. He announced last month he was divorcing his wife
Lyudmila after 30 years of marriage.  -- Editors: Paul Abelsky, Patrick Henry  To contact the reporter on this story:
