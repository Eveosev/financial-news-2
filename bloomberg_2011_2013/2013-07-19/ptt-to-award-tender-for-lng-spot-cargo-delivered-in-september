PTT Pcl (PTT) ,  Thailand ’s state-owned
liquefied natural gas importer, will award a tender today to buy
one cargo delivered in the second half of September, according
to a company official.  The tender opened July 12 and closed July 17, said the
official, who asked not to be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak to the media.  PTT needs as much as 2 million metric tons of spot LNG this
year to meet power-industry demand, the official said on April
12. The company has taken delivery of 10 cargoes to date,
according to customs and ship tracking data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
