John Paulson  will be called by the
defense to testify in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission’s civil fraud case against former Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. executive  Fabrice Tourre , a lawyer said.  Paulson, the billionaire head of hedge fund Paulson & Co.,
will testify in the trial, John “Sean” Coffey, a lawyer for
Tourre, told U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest today in
 Manhattan  federal court. Forrest said Paulson may take the stand
Aug. 1.  The SEC sued Tourre and Goldman Sachs in 2010 over a
transaction involving Abacus 2007-AC1, a synthetic
collateralized debt obligation investors used to bet on mortgage
bonds.  Paulson, a  New-York  based hedge fund, used the deal to bet
against mortgage-backed securities. Investors on the other side
of the bet lost more than $1 billion. Goldman Sachs, based in
New York, paid a then-record $550 million to settle the case.
Paulson and his firm, Goldman clients, weren’t sued.  CDOs are debt securities backed -- or collateralized -- by
assets including pools of mortgage bonds and other asset-backed
securities. A synthetic CDO, by contrast, doesn’t directly hold
mortgage securities. It’s linked to the performance of such
assets and allows investors to use credit default swaps to bet
on their performance.  The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
