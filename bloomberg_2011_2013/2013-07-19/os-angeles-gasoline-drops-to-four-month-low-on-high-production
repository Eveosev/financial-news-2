Spot gasoline in Los Angeles tumbled
to the lowest level in four months as production in the state
jumped to a eight-year seasonal high.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob,  production  jumped 5.3
percent in the week ended July 12 to 7 million barrels, the most
for the period since 2005, according to data compiled by the
 California Energy Commission .  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Wilmington
refinery returned its fluid catalytic cracker and alkylation
unit to full rates this week after repairs.  Spot Carbob in Los Angeles declined 6 cents versus gasoline
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange to a discount
of 12 cents a gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at
3:49 p.m. New York time. That’s the lowest level since March 20.  Carbob in  San Francisco  also weakened 0.5 cent against
futures to a discount of 17.5 cents a gallon.  Retail gasoline  in  California  climbed 0.3 cent to $4.042 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s largest
motoring organization, said today on its website.  Conventional gasoline in  Portland  also fell versus futures,
dropping 4 cents to a premium of 4 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in  Los Angeles  and CARB diesel in Los Angeles narrowed for the
third straight day, shrinking 50 cents a barrel to $14.89. The
spread, an approximate measure of refining profits, is at the
lowest level in more than two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
