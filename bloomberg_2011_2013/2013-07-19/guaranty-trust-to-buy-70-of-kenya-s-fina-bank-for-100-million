Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) , Nigeria’s
largest lender by market value, agreed to pay about $100 million
for 70 percent of  Kenya ’s Fina Bank Ltd.  The deal is subject to regulatory approvals in Kenya,
Nigeria,  Rwanda  and Uganda, the Lagos-based bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  Chief Executive Officer Segun Agbaje said in April that
Guaranty Trust, which operates in six countries outside Nigeria,
was targeting East African nations for their “appreciable gross
domestic product, growing investments and ease of doing
business.” Fina Bank had loans of $184 million and customer
deposits of $285 million at the end of March, filings show.  Profit, excluding income from discontinued operations, rose
69 percent to 87.2 billion naira ($541 million) in 2012 from a
year earlier, Guaranty Trust said on April 2.  Guaranty Trust rose 0.2 percent to 26.45 naira as of 11:43
a.m. in Lagos. The stock has advanced 15 percent this year
compared with a 25 percent gain of 10-member Bloomberg Nigerian
Stock Exchange Banking Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
