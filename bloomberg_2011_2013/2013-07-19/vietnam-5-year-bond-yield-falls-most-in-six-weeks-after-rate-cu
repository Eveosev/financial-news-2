The yield on  Vietnam ’s five-year
bonds fell the most in six weeks after the central bank cut
borrowing costs. The dong was steady.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam lowered the repurchase, or open-market operations, rate to 5.5 percent from 6 percent, effective
today, according to an e-mail from the monetary authority.  The reduction will “help banks get more liquidity so they
can buy more bonds,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital Securities Co.  The yield on the five-year securities slid 17 basis points,
or 0.17 percentage point, today to 8.19 percent, according to a
daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
biggest drop since June 6. The yield also fell 17 basis points
this week.  The dong was steady today and this week at 21,223 per
dollar as of 4:27 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate  at 21,036, a
level unchanged since June 28, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
