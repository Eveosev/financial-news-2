Biofuel producers will invest as
much as $69 billion to expand output during the next decade,
driven in part by U.S. policies that increase blending of plant-based fuels into petroleum-based fuel, according to a report
from  Navigant Consulting Inc. (NCI)   Annual biofuel sales will increase to $7.6 billion by 2023
as fuel blenders meet mandated growth targets in the U.S., the
Chicago-based company said today in a  statement .  Standard ethanol made from corn and sugar cane will remain
the largest segment of the market and most of the investment in
research and production will go to advanced biofuels including
biodiesel, biobutenol and cellulosic ethanol made from inedible
agricultural products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
