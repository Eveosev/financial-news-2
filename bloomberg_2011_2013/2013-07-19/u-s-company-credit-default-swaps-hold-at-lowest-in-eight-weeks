A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk held at the lowest in eight weeks as the People’s Bank of
 China  said it will remove the floor on lending rates offered by
financial institutions in the world’s second-biggest economy.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
0.3 basis point to a mid-price of 74.2 basis points at 8:53 a.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure, which has dropped 3.8 basis points this week, is
heading for its lowest closing level since May 23.  Chinese authorities are attempting to reform the financial
system and provide banks more freedom to set borrowing costs as
growth slows. Gross-domestic product in China grew 7.5 percent
in the second quarter, down from 7.7 percent in the prior
period.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
