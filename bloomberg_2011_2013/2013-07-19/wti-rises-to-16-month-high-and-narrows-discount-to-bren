West Texas Intermediate capped a
fourth weekly gain as the U.S. showed signs of economic recovery
and as crude inventories dropped. WTI exceeded Brent for the
first time since 2010 in intraday trading.  Prices settled at a 16-month high as Moody’s Investors
Service revised the U.S.’s Aaa credit-rating outlook to stable
from negative. Crude supplies tumbled 27.1 million barrels in
three weeks ended July 12, the most in weekly statistics dating
to 1982. WTI surpassed Brent by as much as 3 cents as pipeline
and rail shipments helped clear a U.S. bottleneck.  “Improved economic conditions here in the United States
continue to boost the market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We
have a tightening supply outlook. The Brent-WTI spread has moved
a lot. Nothing seems to be able to stop it.”  WTI for August delivery, which expires on July 22, settled
up 1 cent at $108.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest level since March 19, 2012. Trading was 28
percent above the 100-day average for the time of day at 2:48
p.m. Prices increased 2 percent this week, extending July’s gain
to 12 percent. The more-active September contract advanced 6
cents to $107.87.  Brent for September settlement slipped 63 cents, or 0.6
percent, to end the session at $108.07 a barrel on the ICE
Futures Europe Exchange. Volume was 1.1 percent above 100-day
average. The contract fell below WTI in intraday trading for the
first time since Aug. 17, 2010. Brent settled at a 20-cent
premium to the U.S. benchmark.  U.S. Economy  Growth in the U.S. economy, “while moderate,” is
proceeding even as the U.S. has enacted tax increases and
spending reductions that have improved the nation’s debt
trajectory, Moody’s said yesterday in a statement. Moody’s
assigned the negative outlook in August 2011, warning of a
possible downgrade on concern that fiscal discipline was eroding
and the economy was weakening.  “We had a little bit of a risk-on trade based on economic
outlook,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “Inventories have come down a lot.”  U.S.  crude stockpiles  dropped to 367 million barrels last
week, the lowest level since Jan. 18, the Energy Information
Administration reported July 17. Stockpiles at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the biggest oil-storage hub, decreased 882,000 barrels
to 46.1 million, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  Improving Transport  The convergence between Brent, a pricing benchmark for more
than half the world’s oil, and WTI shows how better pipeline
networks and the use of rail have helped to unlock a supply glut
at Cushing. WTI, the bellwether U.S. crude, had typically been
the more expensive grade until mid-2010.  “The key factor driving WTI is the narrowing Brent-WTI
spread, which is signaling the bottleneck is alleviating,” said
Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in St. Louis, which oversees $1.4 billion.  Crude also advanced as the dollar weakened after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke damped speculation that a
reduction of U.S. monetary stimulus was imminent. The currency
fell as much as 0.3 percent to $1.3154 per euro from yesterday’s
$1.3109. A weaker dollar boosts oil’s investment appeal.  Relative Strength  Prices fell 0.5 percent in intraday trading on speculation
this month’s gain has been excessive. WTI’s 14-day relative
strength index was 75.2, staying above 70 for an 11th day, a
sign that prices may decline. The streak of 11 days over 70 is
the longest since 2002. Some investors start selling contracts
when the reading crosses that threshold, seen as a sign that
speculative buying has driven prices unreasonably high.  “The speed of the rise is too fast,” said Chris Barber, a
senior analyst at Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
 Massachusetts . “Investors were a little overexuberant.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
September was 21.8 percent, compared with 20.2 percent
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 693,771
contracts as of 3:12 p.m. It totaled 715,326 contracts
yesterday, 8.5 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.86 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
