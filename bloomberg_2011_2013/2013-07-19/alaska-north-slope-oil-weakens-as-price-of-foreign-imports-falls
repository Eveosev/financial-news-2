Alaska North Slope crude on the  spot
market  weakened as the price of foreign imports it competes
against for space in West Coast refineries fell.  Brent, the European benchmark, slid to a discount to U.S.
West Texas Intermediate in intraday trading today for the first
time since Aug. 17, 2010. Brent’s premium to WTI averaged $17.47
in 2012, and traded $23.44 higher on Feb. 8.  ANS competes against foreign oils priced off Brent for
space in refineries on the U.S. West Coast. Those refineries
have increasingly had to turn to foreign imports and even
railroad shipments of oil from the middle of the U.S. to make up
for Alaska oil  output  falling to 523,000 barrels a day in April
from a peak of 2.09 million in March 1988.  ANS, a medium, sour crude, weakened by $1 to a premium of
$4.50 a barrel more than WTI at 4:33 p.m.  New York  time, the
lowest level since January 2011 according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The premium shrank by nearly half in a week from
$8.85 a barrel on July 12.  “This is really all about the Brent-TI spread,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Houston-based Lipow Oil Associates LLC.
