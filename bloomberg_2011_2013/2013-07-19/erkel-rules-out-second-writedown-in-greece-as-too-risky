German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
rejected a second Greek debt writedown as officials weigh
additional measures to prop up the bailed-out nation.  “I’ve said repeatedly that I don’t see a debt cut for
Greece,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin today at a press
conference. “All this talk about it sometimes worries me.”  Merkel echoed her finance minister,  Wolfgang Schaeuble , who
went to  Athens  yesterday to urge the country to stand by its
commitments to overhaul its economy and repair its finances.
Schaeuble raised the prospect of debt relief building on
previous measures such as cutting the rate on bailout loans. He
also ruled out a debt writedown.  In 2012, Greece benefited from the biggest-ever sovereign
restructuring. Private investors took a 53.5 percent loss on the
face value of their Greek bond holdings, reducing the nation’s
debt by about 100 billion euros ($131 billion).  “You have to consider the consequences” of a second
writedown, Merkel said. “Maybe someone else would like to have
a debt cut then. That can lead to such massive insecurity among
investors into the euro region that everything we did in the
last few years would be called into question. It’s not for
nothing that when we did the debt relief, we chose a voluntary
agreement with the private creditors. You have to look far
beyond  Greece  to see what this would mean.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
