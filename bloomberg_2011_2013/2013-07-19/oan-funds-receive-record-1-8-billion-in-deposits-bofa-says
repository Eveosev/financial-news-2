Investors added $1.8 billion this
week into funds that purchase leveraged loans in the U.S., an
all-time high, according to  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)   The increase brought deposits this year to about $38
billion, almost a 50 percent rise in assets, the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based bank said in a report yesterday. U.S.
speculative-grade bond funds reported an inflow of $2.8 billion,
the most since October 2011.  Funds that invest in senior-ranking bank debt have gained
every single week this year, returning  3.1 percent , Standard &
Poor’s/LSTA index data show. Prices on the largest, first lien
floating-rate borrowings rose to 98.26 cents on the dollar, the
most since May 31.  Leveraged loans are a form of high-risk debt that carry
ratings of less than Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and below
BBB- at S&P.  Speculative-grade bond yields, which had climbed to a one-year high last month, dropped to 6.13 percent yesterday,
according to the average yield-to-worst measure on the  Bloomberg
USD High Yield Corporate Bond Index. (BUHY)  Junk-bond gains have
increased to 3.24 percent, the index data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
