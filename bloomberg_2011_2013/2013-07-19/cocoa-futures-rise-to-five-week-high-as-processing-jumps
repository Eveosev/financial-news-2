Cocoa futures rose to a five-week
high after a report showed North American processing topped
estimates by analysts. Coffee, sugar, orange juice and cotton
also advanced.  The cocoa grind in the U.S.,  Canada  and  Mexico  jumped 12
percent to 126,044 metric tons in the second quarter from a year
earlier, the Washington-based National Confectioner’s
Association said yesterday after the close of trading. On
average, analysts expected a 4.4 percent gain, according to a
Bloomberg survey. This week, industry groups in Europe and Asia
reported increases in processing.  “It was a positive, strong number for the market, up
really significantly above all trade estimates” in North
America, Jack Scoville, a vice president at Price Futures Group
Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The economy is
slowly but surely improving, and that will keep consumption
going up. People are eating more chocolate.”  Cocoa for September delivery increased 1.2 percent to
$2,376 a ton at 10:10 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. Earlier, the
price reached $2,377, the highest for a most-active contract
since June 12.  Chocolate sales climbed 6.3 percent in June from a year
earlier, according to data from research company IRI compiled by
Bloomberg Industries.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery rose 1.4
percent to $1.293 a pound. Yesterday, the price reached $1.34,
the highest since May 21.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery gained 0.6 percent
to 16.27 cents a pound. Through yesterday, the price dropped 17
percent this year.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 0.6
percent to $1.4395 a pound.  Cotton futures for December delivery increased 1.1 percent
to 85.78 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
