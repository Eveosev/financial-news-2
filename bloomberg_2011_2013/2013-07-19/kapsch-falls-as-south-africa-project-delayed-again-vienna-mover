Kapsch TrafficCom AG (KTCG) , the Austrian
maker of toll-road systems, headed for the lowest since April
after it said a South African project that was expected to start
this month has been delayed.  The  shares  fell as much as 4.1 percent and traded 3.6
percent lower at 2:04 p.m. in Vienna, making it the worst
performer in the 37-member  ATX Prime Index. (ATXPRIME)  A close at that
level would be the stock’s lowest price since April 23. About
9,700 shares traded, or 84 percent of the three-month daily
average.  The South African electronic toll project, which the
company said will boost revenue by more than 50 million euros
($65.6 million) a year, is “the most important trigger for
Kapsch’s share price,” Daniel Lion, a Vienna-based analyst at
 Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , said by phone today. Had it started
operating “it would’ve been nice”.  The system, in South Africa’s Gauteng province that
includes Johannesburg and the capital,  Pretoria , has been
repeatedly delayed after opposition from drivers, labor unions
and car rental agencies. It is unclear when the project will
start because discussions about a legal framework are taking
longer than expected, Kapsch said on July 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
