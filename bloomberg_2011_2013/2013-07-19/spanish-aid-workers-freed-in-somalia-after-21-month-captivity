Two Spanish aid workers abducted
from a United Nations-run refugee camp in northern  Kenya  and
held hostage for 21 months have been freed in neighboring
Somalia, Medecins Sans Frontieres said.  Montserrat Serra and Blanca Thiebaut are “safe and
healthy” and looking forward to reuniting with loved ones,
Switzerland-based MSF said in a  statement  on its website
yesterday. Plans are being made for their return home.  “MSF wishes to thank everyone involved in securing their
safe release,” according to the statement, which didn’t give
details about how they were freed.  The women were abducted on Oct. 13, 2011, from Dadaab
refugee camp, one of the world’s largest sites housing mainly
Somalis who fled war and hunger. Their capture, along with
attacks on other foreigners in Kenya including the shooting
death of a British tourist, were blamed by Kenyan authorities on
al-Shabaab, al-Qaeda’s affiliate in  Somalia . It prompted the
Kenyan army on Oct. 16 to deploy troops into southern Somalia to
help drive out the militia and stabilize the country.  Kenyan troops last year joined the African Union Mission in
Somalia, or Amisom, working alongside government troops.  Somalia has been mired in civil conflict and lawlessness
since the fall of Mohamed Siad Barre’s dictatorship in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
