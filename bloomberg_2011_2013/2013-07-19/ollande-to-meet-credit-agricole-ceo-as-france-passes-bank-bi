President Francois Hollande will
today meet  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Chifflet, head of the French banking federation, after
parliament approved a bill to separate proprietary trading.  The French senate passed the banking bill yesterday, a day
after the lower house cleared the way for its approval. While
fighting financial “speculation” was a cornerstone of
Hollande’s presidential campaign last year, his plan to
segregate the riskiest banking activities is narrower than
proposals to the European Union from a group led by Bank of
Finland Governor Erkki Liikanen.  The bill makes France the first European nation to seek to
move riskier banking activities away from traditional services,
trying to take taxpayers off the hook for bailouts and protect
depositors in the event of failure. The French plan requires
banks including BNP Paribas SA and Societe Generale SA, the
country’s largest, to split market activities not needed to
finance the economy into separately capitalized divisions.  The French bank bill, prepared by Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici, also makes it mandatory for lenders to segregate
holdings in hedge funds into separate units and bans high-frequency trading and own-money bets on agricultural
derivatives.  Under the law, the French banking regulator will expand its
oversight on winding down failing institutions and a
“resolution fund” will be set up to minimize taxpayer losses.
The resolution fund, financed by the banking industry, will
reach about 10 billion euros ($13 billion) by 2020, according to
the finance ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
