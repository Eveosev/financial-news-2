Wheat gained for the first time in
six sessions after  China , the world’s biggest consumer,
increased purchases of the grain from the U.S., the top
exporter. Soybeans rose, while corn capped a weekly decline.  Exporters sold 120,000 metric tons of soft-red winter wheat
to China, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today. U.S.
sales to foreign buyers have jumped in the marketing year that
started June 1 to 11.7 million tons, up 44 percent from the same
period a year earlier, government  data  show.  “Wheat’s all about demand,”  Jim Gerlach , the president of
A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler,  Indiana , said by telephone. “Demand
has been very good this year.”  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 0.6 percent to
settle at $6.645 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the first gain since July 11. Prices are down 15 percent
this year, partly on forecasts that global production will
increase to a record.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$12.74 a bushel, the first increase in three sessions. Prices
are down 9.6 percent this year.  Corn futures for December delivery, after the harvest, were
unchanged at $5.0075 a bushel in Chicago. The price is down 28
percent this year as the U.S. government forecast a record
domestic crop of 13.95 billion bushels, a 29 percent increase
from 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
