Historic Burgundies from winemaker
Henri Jayer stretching back more than four decades led a wine
auction by  Sotheby’s (BID)  in London, accounting for four of the top
five lots and beating presale estimates on strong Asian demand.  Eleven bottles of Jayer’s 1970 Richebourg sold on July 17
for 72,850 pounds ($110,800) including a buyer’s premium,
compared with an upper estimate excluding fees of 34,000 pounds,
according to a Sotheby’s statement. A four-bottle lot of Jayer’s
Vosne-Romanee 1990 Cros Parantoux and a half-case of the 1993
each sold for 37,600 pounds while a magnum of 1978 Richebourg
fetched 28,200 pounds.  Demand for rare Burgundies has driven auctions this year,
with Asian buyers acquire all of the top four Jayer lots and
seven out of the top 10 lots at the sale. Chinese and other
collectors have focused more on that region than on the Bordeaux
wines which powered a market bull run in 2010 and 2011.  “The Asians are still very strong buyers,” Stephen Mould,
head of Sotheby’s European wine department, said by telephone.
“The online bidding goes from strength to strength.”  Jayer, who died in 2006, has become one of Burgundy’s most
sought-after wine-makers. His Cros Parantoux, from a 2.5-acre (1
hectare) premier cru vineyard that was an artichoke field in
World War II, has acquired trophy status, with a case of the
1985 vintage fetching as much as HK$2.06 million ($265,600) at a
Christie’s International Plc sale in  Hong Kong  in February 2012.  Pomerol Producers  Chateau Petrus , one of the two most expensive Pomerol
producers, topped Bordeaux lots at the Sotheby’s sale this
month, with 11 bottles of the 1990 fetching 25,850 pounds. Five
magnums each of Petrus’s 1967 and 1976 vintages sold for 14,100
pounds and 11,163 pounds respectively, while three bottles of
the 1976 reached 2,233 pounds. “Petrus still seems to be in
demand,” Mould said.  The auction came as the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a
barometer of Bordeaux prices in the wider market, has risen 4
percent this year. It fell 2 percent in the second quarter, and
has slipped further during July, after a 7 percent gain in the
first three months.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
