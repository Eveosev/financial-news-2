Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  is considering
giving ValueAct Holdings LP a board seat in response to pressure
from the activist shareholder, a person with knowledge of the
matter said.  ValueAct, which in April disclosed a stake of about $1.9
billion in Microsoft, is urging the company to focus more on
business software and Internet-based cloud services, putting
less emphasis on consumer products, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the talks are private. ValueAct is
coordinating efforts with other shareholders, this person said.  Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer  is struggling to
introduce products that capitalize on a shift toward mobile
computing amid declining sales of machines running Windows. The
world’s largest software maker reported fourth-quarter profit on
July 18 that missed analysts’ projections by the biggest margin
in at least a decade. Results also were hurt by a $900 million
writedown of unsold inventory of Microsoft’s newly introduced
Surface tablet.  If Microsoft doesn’t grant ValueAct a seat, the investor
will probably start a proxy fight to appoint a director, the
person said. After the earnings report, ValueAct has a greater
chance of winning, the person said.  “The earnings release and the execution plays to
ValueAct,” said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Becker
Capital Management Inc. in  Portland ,  Oregon , which owns
Microsoft shares. “Those two items, together with the
disappointing earnings release and how big of a message was sent
with the decline in the stock price, at a minimum, create a
conversation.”  Proxy Matters  Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment, saying the company doesn’t
discuss private meetings.  Reuters  reported  yesterday that Microsoft has met with
ValueAct to discuss a board seat.  The investor has met with Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood
and her predecessor, Peter Klein, the person said.  Any proxy matters must be filed by shareholders by the end
of August, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Microsoft usually holds its annual meeting in November.  ValueAct Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Ubben said at a
conference in New York in April that ValueAct held almost 60
million shares in Microsoft. That would put San Francisco-based
ValueAct among the top 20 biggest investors, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ValueAct  manages more than $10 billion in
assets, according to its website.  Ubben didn’t respond to requests for comment.  Microsoft fell 11 percent to $31.40 at yesterday’s close in
New York, the most since January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
