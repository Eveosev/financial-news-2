Electricity prices for mining
companies that tap into Mongolia’s central grid will rise by as
much as 30 percent in August, the country’s Energy Regulatory
Commission said today.  “The mining companies are using most of the energy in the
country, around 40 percent of the total,” Sainbuyan Otgonbayar,
chairman of the commission, said at a briefing today. “So
instead of increasing the price for citizens, we have decided to
pass the biggest part of the cost increase to the mining
companies.”  The cost of electricity at peak times will rise 30 percent
from current rates, with the average price increase at 24.86
percent, said Sereejav Tsetsgee, the head of the ERC’s
regulation department.  The new rates will go into effect on August 5, Tsetsgee
said. The rates would not apply to mining companies that source
electricity from outside the central grid. The Oyu Tolgoi
copper-gold-silver mine is one such example as the mine -- 66
percent owned by  Canada ’s  Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ)  and 34
percent owned by the Mongolian government -- receives its
electricity from  China .  In addition to the rate increase on mining companies,
businesses across the country will see their electricity rates
rise by an average of 18.32 percent, Tsetsgee said.  Residential rates for apartments will remain at the current
79 tugrik ($0.0537 cents) per kilowatt hour up to 150kw of
usage. If the usage exceeds 150kw the rate will increase to 96
tugrik, which could be an increase of up to 15 percent, Tsetsgee
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
