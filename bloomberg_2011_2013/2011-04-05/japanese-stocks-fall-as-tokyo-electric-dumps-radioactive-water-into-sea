Japanese stocks fell, dragging the
Topix index down by the most in three weeks, after Tokyo
Electric Power Co. began dumping radioactive water from its
crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station into the sea.  Nippon Suisan Kaisha Ltd. (1332) , which fishes and produces
seafood products, lost 4.9 percent.  Maruha Nichiro Holdings Inc. (1334) ,
which sells seafood, dropped 2.5 percent. Tokyo Electric Power
plunged to a 60-year low for the biggest drop on the Nikkei 225
Stock Average.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker,
fell 2.4 percent.  Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035) , the world’s second-
largest maker of semiconductor equipment, slumped 2.8 percent
after a report showed global chip sales fell.  The Nikkei 225 declined 1.1 percent to 9,615.55 as of the
close of trading in Tokyo, its biggest loss since March 23. The
gauge has fallen 7.9 percent since the close on March 10, the
day before Japan was hit by a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami.  Dumping radioactive water “is a big problem and it’s
really difficult to see what will happen next,” said Shintaro Takeuchi, who helps manage about $20 billion at Tokio Marine &
Nichido Fire Insurance Co. “There is nothing positive coming
out from that. The negative impact on companies will continue
until the first half of this fiscal year, and that would be the
major factor to depress the equity market or the industry.”  The broader Topix fell 1.5 percent to 847.16 today, the
most since March 15. More than 10 stocks dropped for every one
that gained on the 1,666-member gauge.  U.S. Stocks  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2
percent today. The index closed little changed yesterday, with
most stocks rising as increasing mergers and takeovers
outweighed a drop in technology shares following a report
showing lower chip sales.  The Topix Fishery, Agriculture & Forestry Index fell 2.3
percent today, the subgroup measure’s third straight day of
declines. Nippon Suisan lost 4.9 percent to 212 yen, its lowest
level since March 2009 and the second-biggest decline on the
 Nikkei 225. (NKY)  Maruha Nichiro dropped 2.5 percent to 115 yen.  Tokyo Electric Power, also known as Tepco, began dumping
radioactive water into the sea so that it would have a place to
store more highly contaminated water.  The Fukushima Prefectural Federation of Fisheries Co-
operative Associations, a fishing industry group in Japan’s
Fukushima Prefecture where the crippled Dai-Ichi nuclear power
plant is located, asked Tepco to stop releasing radioactive
water into the sea.  Hitting All Sides  “The blow from the earthquake is hitting all sides,” said
Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend
Securities Co.  Tepco shares plunged by its daily limit of 80 yen, or 18
percent, to 362 yen, the lowest level since its listing in
August 1951.  “The news of the discharge of contaminated water was
negatively received while there is no sign for the situation to
settle down,” said Satoshi Yuzaki, Tokyo-based head of the
market information department at Takagi Securities Co.  The Topix Transportation Equipment Index was the heaviest
drag on the Topix index among its 33 industry groups, as
carmakers led declines following reports of production
disruptions in  North America .  Carmaker Production Disruptions  Toyota slumped 2.4 percent to 3,260 yen, the biggest drag
on the Topix index. Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s No. 2 carmaker by
market value, dropped 2.5 percent to 2,934 yen, the largest drag
on the Nikkei. Nissan Motor Co., which counts North America as
its largest market, fell 2.2 percent to 715 yen.  Toyota will likely have to temporarily halt production at
all of its North American plants because of parts shortages
following the earthquake in Japan, the  Associated Press  reported,
citing spokesman Mike Goss. Nissan and Honda operations in North
America may also be hampered, Kyodo news reported, without
citing anybody.  “The most important thing is assessing the negative impact
from the crisis on corporate profits in this fiscal year,”
Takeuchi said. “If we can get a more precise number, we can
then make decision on investing.”  Computer Chips  Among other stocks that fell today,  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) 
declined 1.5 percent to 260 yen. The company was placed on
review for a possible downgrade as Japan’s earthquake and
tsunami may delay the steelmaker’s efforts to improve its
finances, Moody’s Investors Service’s said in a release
yesterday.  Tokyo Electron slumped 2.8 percent to 4,510 yen, the third-
biggest drag on the Nikkei 225.  Advantest Corp. (6857) , the world’s No.
1 manufacturer of memory-chip testers, declined 1.4 percent to
1,501 yen.  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , the world’s third-biggest maker
of computer memory chips, dropped 4.2 percent to 1,068 yen.  The  Semiconductor Industry Association  said the three-month
average for global chip sales was $25.5 billion in February,
down 1.1 percent from January  To contact the reporters on this story:
