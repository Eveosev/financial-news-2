AT&T Inc. (T)  and  Verizon Wireless  will
open their Isis mobile venture to all payment networks, ending
the exclusivity of an earlier agreement with  Discover Financial
Services. (DFS)   The venture, which lets people make purchases with their
smartphones, said in a statement that it will open its payment
system to all card networks.  Isis  also includes  Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTE) â€™s T-Mobile USA unit.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  said today that it plans to start a
competing service that also will use the technology called near-
field communication, or NFC, which allows smartphones to make
purchases by tapping them on or waving them near electronic
readers in stores.  Discover, based in Riverwoods, Illinois, rose 49 cents, or
2 percent, to $24.64 today in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have gained 36 percent since Isis was
announced in November.  Verizon Wireless is co-owned by  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 
and  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD)   To contact the reporter on this story:
