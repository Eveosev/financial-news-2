Copper probably will reach record
high prices in the second half of the year as demand outpaces
supply, GFMS Ltd. said in its Copper Survey 2011.  The copper market went into deficit in the second half of
last year as global refined consumption exceeded supply by
286,000 metric tons, the London-based consulting firm said in
the survey released today in Santiago. Demand will remain
strong, driven by  developing countries  including  China  and a
continued recovery of mature economies, it wrote.  Refined production is unlikely to outpace demand this year,
even as mine output and scrap volumes rise, GFMS said. Prices
would rebound from any near-term decline caused by unreported
inventories or negative news, it said. Copper, which rose 30
percent last year, fell 1.8 percent in the first quarter. It
rose 0.6 percent to $9,390 per metric ton in  London  today.  “Eventually investors would regain their confidence in
copper’s longer-term fundamentals and return to the market,”
GFMS wrote. “Coupled with an ever-tighter fundamental market,
as deficits continue to work their way through stockpiles, GFMS
expect that this will see prices resume their upward trajectory
and that a new peak towards the $11,000 mark will be breached,
in the second half of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
