Peru’s economy probably expanded
about 10 percent in February from a year earlier, fueled by
private investment, El Peruano  cited  Finance Minister Ismael Benavides as saying.  Tax collection likely increased 20 percent in March from
the same 2010 month after increased consumer demand offset a cut
in the  sales tax  last month, the state-owned newspaper said
citing Benavides’ comments to reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
