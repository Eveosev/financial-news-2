The U.S. State Department  renewed a
 travel warning  for its nationals considering visits to Lebanon
and cautioned Americans living in the country about risks caused
by political tensions.  U.S. citizens should “avoid all travel to Lebanon due to
current safety and security concerns,” the Department of State
said in a statement posted on its  website  late yesterday in
 Washington . “U.S. citizens living and working in Lebanon should
understand that they accept risks in remaining and should
carefully consider those risks.”  Tensions have grown in anticipation that an indictment by a
United Nations tribunal investigating the killing of former
Lebanese premier  Rafiq Hariri  may implicate members of the
Shiite Hezbollah movement and could lead to an outbreak of
violence, according to some Lebanese politicians. Lebanon has
seen repeated outbreaks of sectarian strife and a 15-year civil
war ended in 1990.  Hezbollah brought down Saad Hariri’s coalition government
on Jan. 12 because of the UN inquiry. It alleges the  tribunal 
probing the killing was instigated by the U.S. and  Israel  to
target the group, along with Syria, which supports Hezbollah. An
indictment filed in January by the UN prosecutor is being
reviewed by a court in the Netherlands.  Hezbollah’s leader,  Hassan Nasrallah , has said he expects
the judge to indict some of his members. Both Hezbollah and
Syria have denied any involvement in Hariri’s death.  The State Department’s latest warning supersedes one issued
in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
