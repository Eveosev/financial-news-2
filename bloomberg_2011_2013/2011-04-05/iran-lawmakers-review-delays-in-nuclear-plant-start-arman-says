Delays to the start of  Iran ’s first
nuclear power plant, Bushehr, are being reviewed by parliament’s
energy committee and discussed with the country’s Atomic Energy
Organization officials,  Arman  reported, citing the committee’s
head, Hamid-Reza Katouzian.  The removal in late February of fuel rods from the Russian-
built Bushehr reactor may delay the start of the nuclear plant’s
electricity generation by up to one year, Katouzian had earlier
said, according to the newspaper.  Russia does not seem to have the will to cooperate with
Iran on the start of the reactor, he said, according to Arman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
