Manchester United  forward  Wayne
Rooney  has admitted a Football Association charge of using
offensive language, but has appealed the automatic two-match
suspension it brought.  Rooney was charged yesterday for cursing into a field-side
television camera during a 4-2 win at West Ham three days ago.
The F.A. said in a statement Rooney was appealing because he
felt the two-match ban was “clearly excessive.”  The case will be heard tomorrow, the F.A. said. The ban
will keep Rooney from this weekend’s Premier League match
against Fulham and the F.A. Cup semifinal against Manchester
City on April 16, and may be extended if the appeal fails.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
