The cost of protecting Japanese
bonds from non-payment rose, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index rose 1 basis point to 139
basis points as of 9:40 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche
Bank AG. The benchmark climbed to a nine-month high of 147 basis
points on March 16 after the nationâ€™s March 11 earthquake and
tsunami, according to data provider CMA in  New York .  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 0.5 basis point to
103.5 as of 10:36 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 104 as of 8:42
a.m. in Singapore, according to Barclays Plc.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
