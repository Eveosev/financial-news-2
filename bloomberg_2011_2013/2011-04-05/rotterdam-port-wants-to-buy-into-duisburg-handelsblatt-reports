The Port of Rotterdam wants to buy a
third of Duisburg port,  Handelsblatt  said, citing Rotterdam
Chief Executive Officer Hans Smits.  Smits said the Dutch government and the city of Rotterdam
wouldn’t be opposed in principle to a swap of stakes with the
German government, which owns Duisburger Hafen AG along with the
city of Duisburg and the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia,
the newspaper reported.  Smits added that it wouldn’t be a problem for Rotterdam
port to privately finance the purchase, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
