Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts rose the most in five weeks as traders bet
higher borrowing costs will be needed to cool inflation running
at the fastest pace in more than two years.  Yields on the contracts due in January 2012 climbed 6 basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 12.22 percent at 5 p.m. New
York time. The yields rose 15 basis points on Feb. 24.  Traders who scaled back bets for rate increases after the
central bank said last month that it probably won’t meet its
2011 inflation target are now increasing wagers because of “a
consistent deterioration in inflation expectations, strong
economic data and even still actual inflation,” said  Siobhan Morden , an emerging markets debt strategist with RBS Securities.  “There’s now this groundswell of political and public
opinion that’s pushing back against the central bank because
ultimately there is a political cost of higher inflation,”
Morden said by phone from  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Expectations
are still showing that inflation is not contained and the
strategy of policy mix pursued by the central bank is not yet
effective.”  Economists covering the Brazilian economy raised their
forecast for 2012 inflation to 5 percent, from a week-earlier
forecast of 4.91 percent, according to an April 1  central bank
survey  of about 100 analysts published yesterday. They increased
their projection for 2011 inflation to 6.02 percent, from a
forecast of 6 percent in the previous period.  Bank’s Plan  The central bank will take the needed steps to ensure that
inflation slows to its target over the course of 2012, a
government official familiar with monetary policy strategy, who
asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized to
discuss the issues publicly, said yesterday. Policy makers in
Latin America’s biggest economy will also attempt to bring 2011
inflation as close as possible to the 4.5 percent target, the
official said.  The combination of higher borrowing costs, curbs on
 consumer lending  and government spending cuts will be enough to
bring inflation back to the target in 2012, Carlos Hamilton, the
central bank’s economic policy director, told reporters in
Brasilia on March 30. The bank raised capital and reserve
requirements in December as part of what policy makers call
“macro-prudential measures” to curb the expansion of credit
and quell inflation.  The real weakened 0.1 percent to 1.6096 per dollar, from
1.6073 yesterday, when it held near its strongest level since
2008.  The central bank said it twice bought dollars in the spot
market today first at 1.6078 reais and then at 1.6086 each. The
tactics are part of an effort by policy makers to weaken the
currency, which has gained 44 percent since the end of 2008, the
most among emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
during that period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
