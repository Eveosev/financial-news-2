An insurance charge by the U.S.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on banks’ overnight borrowing
has ruined a lucrative arbitrage opportunity, according to
traders, the Financial Times reported.  The charge, introduced on April 1, is based on borrowers’
risk ratings and is about 15 basis points for bigger banks; it’s
part of an effort to rebuild the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund
after the many bank failures since 2007, the newspaper said.  As a consequence of the charge, banks are abandoning trades
in which they borrowed in the overnight Fed funds market and
deposited the cash with the  Federal Reserve  at an overnight rate
of 25 basis points, the FT said.  That practice may have brought banks risk-free profits of
$200 million since late 2008, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
