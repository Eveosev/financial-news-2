Hessen-Thueringen and other German lenders are making a last-
ditch attempt to keep European regulators from excluding one
type of capital from the latest round of stress tests.  The  European Banking Authority , the organization overseeing
the exams, may exclude a form of non-voting capital common among
German state-owned banks known as silent participations, the
lenders say. The regulator is scheduled to reveal which types of
capital it will accept and how much a bank must hold to pass the
test on April 8, a person familiar with the matter said.  The possible exclusion of silent participations drew
protest from  Germany ’s banking associations and the lenders. At
Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen, or Helaba, such capital accounted
for more than 50 percent of the total at the end of 2010, while
at Norddeutsche Landesbank, or NordLB, it amounted to 30.5
percent of capital in September, company figures show.  “A number of Landesbanken would likely fail the stress
test if silent participations aren’t counted as capital,” said
Otto Dichtl, a London-based credit analyst for financial firms
at Knight Capital Europe Ltd.  Dieter Posch, economy minister for the state of Hesse,
which is Helaba’s partial owner, said the EBA is planning to
ignore valid legal standards and exclude silent participations,
which would cause the lender to fail the  stress test .  Stress Test Boycott  Posch called on the federal government to block such a
decision and said Helaba would examine all legal options and
consider boycotting the stress test, according to a statement on
the ministry’s website.  Hartmut Moellring, NordLB’s supervisory board chairman and
the finance minister of  Lower Saxony , likened the exams to
“character assassination” and said he may pursue legal options
to block them, according to a statement yesterday.  The EBA may exclude most silent participations from its
definition of core capital, said two people familiar with the
talks. Commerzbank AG Chief Executive Officer Martin Blessing
today said the regulator will make an exception for the funds
injected by Germany’s bank-rescue fund, Soffin. An EBA official
declined to comment yesterday.  Silent participations are funds the Landesbanken received
from their owners, savings banks and state governments, and that
confer no  voting rights  and are counted toward reserves. They
were also used by the German government to recapitalize lenders
including  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  during the financial crisis.  ‘Misconstrued Picture’  “If silent participations from Soffin are counted, that
would create a misconstrued picture because then banks that
needed support during the crisis are okay, and some who did
better are hurt,” said Dichtl.  The  Association of German Public Sector Banks , which
represents the country’s state-owned lenders, including
Landesbanken, said last month that silent participations should
count as core capital because during the 2011-2012 timeframe for
the stress tests such instruments are still valid as capital.
New Basel III rules give lenders until 2019 to fully comply.  “Silent partners’ capital contributions are at present and
during the entire simulation period of the test unequivocally
recognized as  Tier-1 capital ,” said Helaba Chief Executive
Officer Hans-Dieter Brenner in an earnings statement on March
24. “Therefore I expect that they will also be taken into
account and recognized accordingly.” A spokesman for Frankfurt-
based Helaba declined to comment beyond those remarks.  Pass Rate  Jan-Peter Hinrichs, a spokesman for Hanover-based NordLB,
said “there is no reason not to use this capital, which today
and also in the future satisfies the respective requirements for
core capital, in the calculations for core capital in the stress
tests.” The bank is collecting data for the stress tests and
won’t comment on the potential outcome, Hinrichs said.  EU regulators are expected to set a pass rate of 5 percent
core Tier 1 capital under the most stressed scenario for this
year’s tests, the European Commission said on April 1. Last
year, banks had to hold 6 percent Tier 1 capital, a measure that
encompasses a broader range of securities, including hybrid
instruments such as preference shares.  Last year’s exams were criticized for not being tough
enough. Lenders in the 27-nation region were shown by regulators
to need only 3.5 billion euros ($5 billion) of new capital,
about a 10th of the lowest analyst estimate.  NordLB, which navigated the financial crisis without
 government aid , had the second-lowest result among 14 German
lenders in EU stress tests last year, with a Tier 1 ratio of 6.2
percent in the most severe scenario. The bank said on March 14
that it plans to comply with Basel III rules four years before
the deadline, forecasting that it will have a core Tier 1 ratio
of 7 percent by 2015.  Helaba, which also didn’t need state aid, had a Tier 1
capital ratio of 9.6 percent at the end of 2010. The ratio fell
to 7.3 percent in the worst-case stress test scenario last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
