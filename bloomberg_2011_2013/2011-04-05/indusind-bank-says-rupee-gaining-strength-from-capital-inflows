J. Moses Harding, a Mumbai-based
executive vice president at IndusInd Bank Ltd., comments on the
outlook for  India ’s rupee.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency
gained 0.3 percent to 45.13 per dollar as of 11:45 a.m. in
 Singapore , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts reflect bets the rupee will weaken 1.6 percent from
the spot rate of 44.43.  “The stock market is looking positive with decent capital
inflows. That is providing adequate liquidity. Overall, the
rupee may trade at 44.50 to 45 for the next one month, with bias
toward extension of gains to 44.35, which may not be sustainable.  “The central bank has been intervening since September,
and they may still be providing cushion against any volatility.
But any reversal of the currency has to happen on its own, based
on fundamentals.  Oil prices  will also come into play at some
stage.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
