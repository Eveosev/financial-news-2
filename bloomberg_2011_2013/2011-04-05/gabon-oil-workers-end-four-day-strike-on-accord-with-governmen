Oil workers in Gabon ended a four-
day strike after reaching an agreement with the government on
their demands.  “We have ordered our workers to go back,” said Arnaud
Engandji, spokesman for the National Organization of Oil
Employees, on Radio Television Gabonaise late yesterday. “We
have obtained satisfaction on our claims.”  The government pledged to identify “illegal workers” in
the industry and to deport them within eight days, Jean Paulin
Ekua Sima, an adviser to Prime Minister Paul Biyoghe-Mba, said
on television yesterday. “The measure could affect 1,300
people.”  Total SA (FP)  said it had restarted oil production in Gabon
following the end of the strike.  “We should get back to normal production by today,”
Phenelope Semavoine, a Paris-based spokeswoman for
Total, said by phone. The company’s oil output in Gabon
was 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent last year, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
