Metcash Trading Africa Ltd. said it
will close 56 stores in  South Africa  on April 9.  The company “is still in consultations with staff
representatives and unions to map out an agreed rationalization
program,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Dodson said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Metcash plans to sell its franchise unit to  Shoprite
Holdings Ltd. (SHP) , Africa’s largest food retailer, in an agreement
that must be approved by South Africa’s antitrust authority,
Metcash said in an e-mailed statement from Johannesburg today.  Included in the Shoprite deal will be Metcash’s Friendly,
Seven Eleven and Price Club Supermarket units, the company
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
