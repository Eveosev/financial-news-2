Minmetals Resources Ltd. (1208) , a unit of
China’s biggest metals trader, wants to add copper assets in
Africa and  South America  in the next three to five years,
Executive General Manager Michael Nossel said.  “The central African copper-belt region, through DRC,
Zambia, is one area and then the Great Andean minerals belt
through Chile and Peru,” Nossel said in an interview in
Singapore today. “These are two areas where we certainly would
hope to add to our portfolio over the next five years.”  Mining companies are competing to secure assets after a
dearth of new global projects and demand from China drove copper
prices to a record this year. Minmetals yesterday announced a
C$6.3 billion ($6.5 billion) unsolicited cash offer for Equinox
Minerals Ltd. The deal,  China ’s biggest minerals takeover, would
give Hong Kong-based Minmetals control of the Lumwana copper
mine in Zambia and Saudi Arabia’s biggest copper deposit.  “Our current portfolio is overweight zinc, underweight
copper,” he said. “Copper was a metal we wanted to add more to
the portfolio; our strategy is diversified base metals.”  Minmetals, which owns the world’s second-biggest zinc mine
and other assets in Australia, Laos and  Canada , may spend $2
billion to $2.5 billion on acquisitions in the resources sector,
Chief Executive Officer Andrew Michelmore said March 29.  --Xiao Yu and Glenys Sim in Singapore. Editors: Alan Soughley,
