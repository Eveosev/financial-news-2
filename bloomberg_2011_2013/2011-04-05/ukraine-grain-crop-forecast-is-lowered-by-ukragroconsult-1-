Ukraineâ€™s grain harvest will
probably be 4.6 percent smaller than estimated a month ago at
44.7 million metric tons because of cold weather in March,
UkrAgroConsult said.  The wheat-crop estimate was lowered by 3.6 percent to 20.5
million tons, the Kiev-based researcher said by e-mail today.
The winter-wheat crop will probably be 19.8 million tons, 3.4
percent less than the previous estimate, it said.  UkrAgroConsult cut its projection for the barley crop by 8
percent to 9.8 million tons, including both winter and spring.
It estimated the corn harvest at 11.9 million tons, down 3.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
