Euro-area states that are unable to
forgo a financial lifeline should be forced to restructure their
debt at speed, “overnight” if necessary, to avoid spooking
markets, the head of  Germany ’s  BDI  industry federation said.  Greece ’s capacity to return quickly to financial health may
be “illusory,” Hans-Peter Keitel said in a speech to savings
bank executives in Berlin today. Should the prospect of a
permanent bailout for such states arise “we must consider a
sovereign insolvency that shouldn’t take weeks or months to
implement, but 24 hours, including the participation of private
creditors,” he said.  There may be “no realistic alternative” to locking over-
indebted countries out of the euro region, said Keitel, who
added that Germany’s economic outlook this year has become
overshadowed by risks including Japan’s earthquake and turmoil
in North Africa and the Middle East. “We tread a fine line, and
as mountaineers know straying to the left or right of the path
is dangerous.”  Greek Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said
yesterday the cost of a debt restructuring “would be much
greater than the benefit,” both for Greece and the rest of
 Europe . Portuguese bonds fell today and the cost of insuring the
nation’s debt rose to a record after Moody’s Investors Service
said a bailout, the third in the euro region after Greece and
Ireland, is inevitable.  Greece will return to bond markets by the start of next
year, Papaconstantinou said in an e-mailed transcript of an
interview with state-run NET radio in  Athens . International
Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said
yesterday the lender supports Greece’s rejection of a debt
restructuring.  To contact the reporters on this story:
