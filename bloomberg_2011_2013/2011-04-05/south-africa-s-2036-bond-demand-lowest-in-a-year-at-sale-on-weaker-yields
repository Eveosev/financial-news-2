Demand for South African 25-year
bonds fell to the weakest level in a year at the central bank
auction as the lowest yield in three months failed to attract
investors.  The Pretoria-based central bank sold 1.2 billion rand ($178
million) of the so-called 6.25 percent R209 bonds due March 2036
at a yield of 8.89 percent, 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage
point, below that achieved at the previous auction on March 22
and the lowest since a sale on Jan. 11, when the yield reached
8.225 percent. Investors bid for 1.7 times the amount on offer,
down from 2.8 on March 22 and the lowest ratio since April 23.  The bank also auctioned 900 million rand of 6.75 percent
bonds due March 2021, called the R208, at a yield of 8.57
percent, 7 basis points lower than the yield achieved on March
29 and the weakest since Feb. 22. Investors bid for 2.6 times
the amount on offer, down from 2.9 on March 29 and the lowest
ratio since Oct. 19.  “After three strong auctions, demand at this week’s
auction was softer,”  Leon Myburgh  and Coura Fall, Johannesburg-
based analysts at Citigroup Inc. wrote in a research note.
“This may be a function of the lower yield levels.”  South African bond yields are near three-month lows on
expectations the central bank will hold back from raising
 interest rates  as it aims to aid a recovery in  Africa ’s largest
economy. The central bank cut its key rate twice last year to
5.5 percent, the lowest in 30 years.  Bonds snapped three days of gains, raising the yield on
debt due 2036 debt by 6 basis points to 8.93 percent at 12:39
p.m. in Johannesburg. On the bonds due 2021, the yield increased
6 basis points to 8.63 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
