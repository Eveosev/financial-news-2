The African Union wants to resume
mediation efforts in  Libya , according to Maite Nkoana-Mashabane,
 South Africa â€™s minister for international relations.  The African Union needs bombardments to stop before
mediation and other diplomatic efforts can resume, she told
reporters in  Pretoria  today. The South African approach to Libya
is based on protecting civilians, Nkoana-Mashabane said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
