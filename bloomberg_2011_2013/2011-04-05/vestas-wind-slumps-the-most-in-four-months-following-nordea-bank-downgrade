Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the largest
wind-turbine maker, fell the most in more than four months after
the stock was cut to “hold” from “buy” at  Nordea Bank AB. (NDA)   The shares dropped 4.9 percent to 213.40 kroner in
Copenhagen, their biggest decline since Nov. 29. That reduced
the company’s gains this year to 21 percent,  On March 30, Vestas introduced a 7-megawatt wind turbine
designed to help the Randers, Denmark-based company compete with
 Siemens AG (SIE)  of  Germany  for the largest share of the offshore wind
power market. The turbines of the new V164, the first in
Vestas’s history specifically designed for offshore wind, will
be taller than the London Tower known as the Gherkin.  New installations of offshore wind turbines may surge 70
percent this year, topping 2010’s record 51 percent gain, the
European Wind Energy Association said in January. The U.K. has
more than 40 percent of the total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
