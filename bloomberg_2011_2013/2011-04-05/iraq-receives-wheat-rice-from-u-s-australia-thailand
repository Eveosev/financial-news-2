Iraq took delivery of 400,000 metric
tons of wheat and 127,000 tons of rice, said Hassan Ismail
Ibrahim, director general of the countryâ€™s Grain Board.  Eight ships delivered the wheat from U.S. and Australian
suppliers and four more boats unloaded the rice imports from
 Thailand  at the southern port of Umm Qasr, Ibrahim said in an e-
mailed statement.  The board in February signed 12 contracts to buy 850,000
tons of wheat from the U.S. and  Australia .  Iraq plans to import 4 million tons of wheat this year,
mainly from the U.S. and Australia, Trade Minister Khairallah Hassan said March 24. Local output of the grain is forecast to
be 1.5 million tons this year, he said.  Surging food costs and rising unemployment have helped spur
protests across northern  Africa  and the Middle East, toppling
leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt  this year. Iraq produces about half
of the grain it consumes and is seeking foreign investment in
agriculture to help meet a target to be self-sufficient within
three years, Agriculture Minister Ezzeddin al-Dawla said March
21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
