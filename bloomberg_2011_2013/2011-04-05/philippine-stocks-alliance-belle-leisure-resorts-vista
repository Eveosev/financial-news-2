Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Philippine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the noon close.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 1 percent to
4,167.09, halting a four-day rally.  Alliance Global Group Inc. (AGI)  , owner of the company
that operates Manila’s biggest casino, sank 6 percent to 11.28
pesos, the sharpest loss since Jan. 10. Alliance and its unit
 Megaworld Corp. (MEG)   sold 872 million shares of the company
at 11.16 pesos each through a so-called private placement, a
stock exchange filing showed. That’s a 7 percent discount to
yesterday’s closing price.  Megaworld, which held 322 million of the Alliance shares
that were sold, advanced 0.9 percent to 2.27 pesos, the highest
since Jan. 17.  Leisure & Resorts World Corp. (LR)  , which will operate a
casino in Manila, advanced 2.2 percent to 10.46 pesos, the
highest close since Oct. 15, 1999, after the company said it
will use part of the funds raised from a share sale for its
casino venture with  Belle Corp. (BEL)  . Leisure said last
month it will sell 150 million shares at 7.50 pesos each in a
private placement. Belle rose 1.1 percent to 5.50 pesos.  “The critical development that the market wants to see is
that Leisure raises the funds to pursue the casino project,”
said Astro del Castillo, managing director at Manila-based
advisory firm First Grade Holdings Inc. “Without these funds
there will be doubts about Leisure’s ability to execute the
project.”  Vista Land & Lifescapes Inc. (VLL)  , a homebuilder,
advanced 1.8 percent to 2.90 pesos, the highest level since Jan.
18. The company reported a 31 percent increase in net income to
3.10 billion pesos last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
