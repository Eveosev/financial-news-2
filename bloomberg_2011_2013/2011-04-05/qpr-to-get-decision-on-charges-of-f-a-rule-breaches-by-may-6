Queens Park Rangers will get a
decision by May 6 on the seven charges of rules breaches against
it from the signing of Alejandro Faurlin, the Football
Association said.  A hearing will start May 3, with the ruling due three days
later, the F.A. said today on its website. The team, which is
leading the Championship, is accused of having an agreement with
a third party over the playerâ€™s economic rights and failing to
notify the F.A. about the pact before the Argentine midfielder
was registered in July 20009, the F.A. said.  The team and executive Gianni Paladini were charged with
giving false information to the F.A. The club and Paladini deny
the charges.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
