Soybean futures fell for the third
straight session and wheat declined on speculation that steps by
 China  to limit inflation will curb demand for U.S. supplies.  China, the largest market for U.S. agricultural goods,
raised borrowing costs for the fourth time since October. Last
month, the country’s inflation accelerated at the fastest pace
since July 2008. The amount of U.S. soybeans inspected for
export in the week ended March 31 fell 25 percent from a week
earlier, the government said yesterday.  Higher  interest rates  in China “put pressure” on
commodities including soybeans and wheat, said Frank Cholly Sr.,
a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago.  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 10.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $13.7325 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade. The price has gained 47 percent in the
past year on record Chinese purchases.  Wheat futures for May delivery dropped 3.75 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $7.8625 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached
$7.9825, the highest since March 8. The grain has climbed 18
percent in the past three weeks as dry weather threatened crops
in the southern and western Great Plains.  Recent gains in wheat may have been exaggerated because
crops in central Kansas are in better shape than areas further
west, said  Tom Leffler , the owner of Leffler Commodities LLC in
Augusta, Kansas.  The USDA said yesterday that 37 percent of winter wheat was
in good or excellent condition as of April 3, the lowest for the
date since 2002, while 31 percent of the crop in  Kansas , the
biggest producer of the variety, got the best ratings, unchanged
from a week earlier. The U.S. is the top grain exporter.  “I don’t think there were any surprises” in the USDA
report, Leffler said. “The bulls are always going to talk about
dry weather, but we’ve been talking about that all winter.”  The soybean crop in the U.S., the leading producer and
exporter, was valued at $38.9 billion in 2010, behind only corn,
government data show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $13
billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
