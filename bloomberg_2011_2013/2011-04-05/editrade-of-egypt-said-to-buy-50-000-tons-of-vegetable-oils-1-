Meditrade, an Egyptian commodity
buyer, bought 39,000 metric tons of soyoil and 11,000 tons of
sunflower oil at a tender today, two traders involved in the
tender said.  Meditrade bought 25,000 tons of soyoil at $1,275 a
ton and 5,000 tons of sunflower oil at $1,323.90 a ton from
Cargill Inc., said the traders, who asked not to be identified
because they are not authorized to speak to the media.  The Cairo-based company also purchased 6,000 tons of
soyoil from Wataniya and 8,000 tons from Alex Seed, both at
7,717 Egyptian pounds ($1,295.89) a ton, and 6,000 tons of
sunflower oil from Quadra at $1,323.90 a ton, the traders said.
