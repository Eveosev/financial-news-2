Syria  invited offers to buy 27,366
metric tons of soft wheat in a tender after failing to attract
suitable suppliers in November, the Syrian General Establishment
of Cereals Trade and Processing said.  Bidders should restrict the origin of imported wheat to
 Turkey , Russia or  Romania , Bassam al Hammed, head of the
foreign-trade department at the state agency, said in an
interview in Damascus today. The deadline for receiving bids is
June 6, according to a tender document.  “We are tendering this amount on behalf of a Lebanese
company that was supposed to supply us with about 100,000 metric
tons, but failed to meet the entire contract,” Hammed said.  Syria tendered in November for the remaining quantity
without attracting any suitable bidders, he said. “We have to
complete the contract now under the same conditions,” the
official said.  Syria’s government imported about 1.3 million tons of wheat
between the end of 2008 and January 2010, according to Hammed.
The government has since stopped all state wheat imports, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
