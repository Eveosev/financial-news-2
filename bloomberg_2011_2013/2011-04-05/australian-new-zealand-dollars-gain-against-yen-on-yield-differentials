The Australian dollar advanced to
the highest level against its U.S. counterpart since it began
trading freely in 1983 as the widening premium offered by bonds
in the South Pacific nation attracted investors.  New Zealand ’s dollar rose for a 10th day versus the yen,
the longest rally since 2005, as traders added to bets the
 Reserve Bank  will increase  interest rates  over the next year.
The Aussie also gained versus the yen. A sale of Australia’s 5.5
percent notes due in January 2018 drew bids for 5.4 times the
amount on offer, the  Australian Office of Financial Management 
said, up from 3.5 times at a sale last month.  “We’re back in yield-chasing mode, and the Aussie is going
to benefit,” said Grant Turley, a senior currency strategist at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Sydney. “We’re
hearing of Aussie-yen buying combined with central-bank buying
of Australian bonds.”  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.9 percent to $1.0425 at 11:43
a.m. in  New York , from $1.0329 yesterday. It reached a record
high of $1.0451. The Aussie gained 1.4 percent to 88.90 yen,
after earlier touching 89.29, the strongest level since
September 2008.  The kiwi gained 1.3 percent to 77.81 U.S. cents and
advanced 1.7 percent to 66.34 yen. It rose as much as 2.3
percent versus the Japanese currency, the largest intraday jump
since March 18.  Higher Yield  Australian two-year notes offer 4.71 percentage points more
yield than similar-maturity Japanese debt, up from 4.68
percentage points yesterday, according to Bloomberg data.  Benchmark rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and 2.5
percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the U.S.
and  Japan , attracting investors to the South Pacific nations’
higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that currency
market moves will erase profits.  “Japan has ultra-loose policy, so the yen will continue to
weaken with Japan lagging any significant recovery,” said
Anthony Gray, head of foreign-exchange dealing in Sydney at
Travelex Global Business Payments, a currency-exchange network.  The  Reserve Bank of New Zealand  will raise interest rates
by 44 basis points over the next year, up from bets yesterday
for 40 basis points, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index
based on swaps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
