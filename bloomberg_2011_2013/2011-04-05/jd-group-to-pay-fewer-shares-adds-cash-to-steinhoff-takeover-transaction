JD Group Ltd., a South African
furniture and appliance retailer, said  Steinhoff International
Holdings Ltd. (SHF)  will get a smaller stake in its business after the
companies agreed to change the terms of a takeover.  JD Group on March 14 said it will buy Unitrans Motor
Enterprises Ltd. and Steinhoff Doors and Building Materials Ltd.
from Steinhoff for 3.04 billion rand ($452 million) in stock,
giving Steinhoff a 26 percent holding. It will now pay 568
million rand cash and the balance in shares, lowering
Steinhoff’s stake to 22.4 percent, JD said in a statement today.  “The revised terms will reduce dilution of and enhance
returns for JD Group shareholders,” Johannesburg-based JD said,
adding that 51.3 percent of its shareholders back the
transaction. Other terms of the agreement remain unchanged.  JD plans to buy Unitrans, Steinhoff’s vehicle retail
business, and Steinhoff Doors and Materials, a building goods
supplier, for about 3 billion rand and 169 million rand
respectively. In turn, JD will sell its stake in Abra Spolka
Akcyjna, a Polish furniture retailer, to a Steinhoff unit for
134 million rand. Steinhoff,  Africa ’s largest furniture maker,
and JD still have to agree terms for the Abra deal, JD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
