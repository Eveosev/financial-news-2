Profit at the biggest U.S. banks may
fall almost 30 percent in fiscal 2012 to $14.9 billion, The New
York Post reported, citing a forecast by  New York City ’s
Independent Budget Office.  The drop in profit at big banks including  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) , Citigroup, Inc.,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,
will eat into city taxes and make New York less able to rely on
banks for revenue, the newspaper said, citing Doug Turetsky,
spokesman for the IBO. The city’s fiscal year ends June 30, the
Post said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
