Copper rose for the first time in
three sessions after reports that heavy rains hampered
production in  Peru  and  Chile , the world’s largest supplier.  Anglo American Plc said yesterday it will struggle to meet
the 2011 production target at its Collahuasi copper mine in
Chile after floods reduced output. Xstrata Plc said production
was disrupted at its Tintaya mine in Peru. Teck Resources Ltd.’s
Quebrada Blanca mine also was affected. Copper reached a record
$4.6575 a pound on Feb. 15.  “Supplies continue to tighten,” Rob Kurzatkowski, a
senior commodities analyst at OptionsXpress Holdings Inc., said
today in an e-mail. “Copper miners have had their hands full
keeping pace with demand.”  Copper futures for May delivery rose 0.95 cent, or 0.2
percent, to close at $4.2645 at 1:20 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The price has climbed 17 percent in the past year.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months gained $60, or 0.6 percent, to $9,390 a metric ton ($4.26
a pound).  Aluminum, lead and zinc also rose in London. Nickel and tin
fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
