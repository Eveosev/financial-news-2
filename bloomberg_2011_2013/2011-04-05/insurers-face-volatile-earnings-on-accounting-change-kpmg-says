European insurers such as  Allianz SE (ALV) 
and  Axa SA (CS)  may face more volatile earnings on proposed changes
to accounting rules, according to KPMG LLP.  To reduce the volatility of their results, “some insurers
may consider changes to their current product offerings, moving
out of longer-term products with embedded guarantees toward
products in which more  investment risk  is borne by policy
holders,” the consulting company said, citing a survey of
insurers’ finance personnel and chief financial officers.  The  International Accounting Standards Board , the
organization that sets accounting standards outside the U.S.,
and its Norwalk, Connecticut-based equivalent, the  Financial
Accounting Standards Board , are working together on a new
standard to account for insurance contracts named IFRS 4. The
London-based IASB aims to complete its draft by June.  Insurers may seek to reduce the expected volatility of
their earnings by “changing their asset mix, entering into new
reinsurance arrangements and engaging into new hedging
strategies,” KPMG said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
