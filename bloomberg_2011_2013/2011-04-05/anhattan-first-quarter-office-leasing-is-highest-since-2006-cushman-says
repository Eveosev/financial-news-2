Manhattan office leasing reached a
four-and-a-half-year high in the first quarter as tenants sought
to complete deals before rents climb further, according to
property broker Cushman & Wakefield Inc.  Rental agreements were signed for 7.6 million square feet
(706,000 square meters) of  office space  in the period, the most
since the third quarter of 2006, the New York-based company said
today in a report. Rents sought by landlords rose for the second
straight quarter after more than two years of declines, to an
average of $54.73 a square foot.  “You have a vibrant economy, a lack of new construction,
and you don’t have any sublet space coming on the market,”
Joseph Harbert, Cushman’s chief operating officer for the New
York region, said at a briefing for reporters. “It’s a pretty
simple equation. What’s going to happen? Prices are going up.”  Rents have been rising and vacancies falling in New York as
the market recovers from the credit crisis, which froze leasing
by financial-services firms. Demand in the first quarter was led
by government, education and social services. The largest lease
in the quarter was signed by the city of  New York , which took
619,000 square feet in a tower being built at the  World Trade
Center site , Cushman said.  Li & Fung Group, a Hong Kong-based supplier to retailers,
took 482,000 square feet in the Empire State Building, according
to the brokerage.  Trade Center Lease  The law firm WilmerHale today signed a 210,000-square-foot
lease of floors 41 through 45 at 7 World Trade Center, the first
of the buildings destroyed on 9/11 to be rebuilt, according to a
statement from Mayor  Michael Bloomberg ’s office. The mayor is
founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg
News.  WilmerHale, currently at 399 Park Ave., had been “very
committed to being in Midtown,” Harbert said, and the deal
shows that the tightening of the market is driving tenants to
less-expensive downtown space.  A recovery in jobs is helping fuel demand for offices, said
Kenneth McCarthy, head of New York-area research for Cushman.
The city’s seasonally adjusted  unemployment rate  was 8.9 percent
in February, a percentage point below where it was a year
earlier, the state Labor Department said March 24.  New York Jobs  New York has recovered about 43 percent of the 140,000 jobs
it lost in the recession, compared with about 17 percent
regained nationally, McCarthy said. For office-using jobs, the
city’s recovery is 42 percent, he said. Financial-service
companies, Manhattan’s largest users of offices, have restored
about 12,000 jobs since the rebound began, according to Cushman.  “We’re clearly in the recovery,” Harbert said. “The
question is how sustainable is that recovery going to be. Are we
in that period of recovery that happens each time there’s a
recession? Can we sustain 2 and a half million square feet a
month, or are we going to see a little bit of a leveling off? We
shouldn’t be ebullient about this yet.”  Overall asking rents are 1.2 percent below a year earlier,
when they were $55.38 a square foot, Cushman reported.  Net effective rents, or rents on completed leases, climbed
24 percent from a year earlier, the broker said.  Manhattan ’s office vacancy rate was 10 percent, down from
the peak of 11.6 percent a year earlier and 10.5 percent at the
end of 2010.  Vacancy Declines  Vacancy dropped in all three of the borough’s submarkets.
In Midtown, the biggest and most expensive U.S. office market,
the rate was 10.3 percent, down from 10.6 percent in December
and 12.6 percent a year earlier.  Lower Manhattan’s vacancy rate fell to 10.5 percent from
11.5 percent at the end of December. It was 10 percent at the
year-earlier period. Vacancy in Midtown South, the area roughly
between 30th and Canal streets, was the lowest of any U.S.
central business district at 8 percent, down from 8.6 percent in
December and 9.9 percent a year earlier, Cushman said.  Midtown rents were $62.63 a square foot, up 0.3 percent
from the fourth quarter and 1.1 percent from a year earlier.
Downtown rents climbed 1.1 percent to $39.22 a square foot from
December, and were up about 0.7 percent from March 2010.  Midtown South rents declined to $43.83 a square foot from
$44.73 at the end of 2010, and are down 5.4 percent from a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
