Hulamin Ltd. (HLM) ,  Africa ’s largest maker
of fabricated aluminum products, increased the pay of former
chief executive officer Alan Fourie by 67 percent even as profit
dropped by almost a fifth.  Fourie, 61, who took early retirement, received a total
package of 10.74 million rand ($1.6 million) for the six months
he worked through June 2010, up from 6.4 million rand for the
whole of 2009, according to the Pietermaritzburg, South Africa-
based company’s annual report, posted to investors last week.  The package included base pay of 2.6 million rand, a
retirement gratuity payment of 1.2 million rand, pension fund
waiver of 1.8 million rand and a 4.8 million rand gain on share
options, the report showed.  Hulamin’s net income fell 18 percent to 73.2 million rand
in the year through December as costs soared. During the year,
its cash on hand shrunk by almost two-thirds to 24.4 million
rand while its share price slid 26 percent. Hulamin’s net income
amounted to 204.1 million rand in 2006.  Richard Jacob, 45, who replaced Fourie in July, earned 2.76
million rand last year, according to the annual report, helping
to push total executive earnings up to 20.3 million rand in
2010, compared with 13.7 million rand the prior year. No
performance related bonuses were paid in 2010, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
