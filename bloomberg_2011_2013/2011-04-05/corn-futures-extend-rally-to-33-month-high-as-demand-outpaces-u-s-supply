Corn prices climbed to the highest
since July 2008 on speculation that U.S. inventories will
tighten as demand increases for food, livestock feed and fuel.  U.S. corn stockpiles on March 1 dropped to the lowest for
the date in four years, the Department of Agriculture said last
week. The agency may cut its forecast this week for supplies
held as of Aug. 31. The U.S. sold 101,600 metric tons to unknown
destinations, the USDA said today. High fuel costs are boosting
demand for grain-based ethanol, and feed demand is rising as
cattle and hog prices climb.  “Meat is at all-time highs, so obviously feed usage isn’t
likely to be rationed,” said Frank Cholly Sr., a senior
strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in  Chicago . “The ethanol
grind isn’t likely to slow down as long as they’re profitable,
so corn prices have to go higher.”  Corn futures for May delivery rose 6.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $7.6675 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the highest closing price on record for
a contract closest to expiration. Earlier, the commodity reached
$7.7075, the highest since July 3, 2008. Corn has more than
doubled in the past year.  U.S. supplies on Aug. 31 may drop to 589 million bushels,
less than the USDA’s March estimate of 675 million, according to
the average estimate of 30 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.
The government will update its projection for domestic and
global stockpiles on April 8. The U.S. is the world’s largest
producer, exporter and user.  China , the second-biggest corn consumer, may need to buy 2
million to 3 million tons before Aug. 31 as economic growth
boosts demand for livestock feed, the U.S. Grains Council said
today.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
