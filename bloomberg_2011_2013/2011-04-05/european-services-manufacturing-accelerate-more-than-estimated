Growth in  Europe ’s services and
manufacturing industries accelerated more than initially
estimated in March, led by  Germany  and  France .  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in the 17-nation euro region in both industries fell to
57.6 from 58.2 in February, London-based Markit Economics said
today. That’s above an initial estimate of 57.5 released on
March 24. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  A gauge of services advanced to 57.2 from 56.8 in February,
Markit said. An indicator of manufacturing dropped to 57.5 from
59 the previous month, it said on April 1.  The euro declined after the data were published, trading at
$1.4177 at 10:16 a.m. in  Frankfurt , down 0.3 percent on the day.  The index of services in Germany rose to 60.1 in March from
58.6 a month earlier, while in France the gauge increased to
60.4 from 59.7, Markit said.  “Manufacturing continued to lead the expansion, despite
seeing the rate of increase in production ease to a three-month
low,” Markit said. “Service-sector business activity meanwhile
accelerated to the strongest since August 2007, suggesting a
further broadening out of the recovery beyond the goods-
producing sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
