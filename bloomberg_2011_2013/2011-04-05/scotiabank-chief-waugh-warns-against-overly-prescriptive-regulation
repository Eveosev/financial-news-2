Financial reforms including ones
proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision may work
against countries such as Canada,  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  Chief
Executive Officer Richard Waugh said.  “The approach currently being taken is in danger of
placing too much emphasis on overly prescriptive rules and
requirements, which have never proven effective in preventing
crises,” said Waugh, according to the text of a speech he will
deliver today at the bank’s 179th annual meeting of shareholders
in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  Waugh, head of Canada’s third-largest bank, said many
industry reforms are reacting to previous crises rather than
preventing new ones. Instead, he recommended banks adopt a “low
to moderate risk appetite” while keeping sustainable profit
levels.  “The next crisis isn’t likely to look like the last one,
and it’s impossible to design rules for every scenario,” Waugh
said. “That’s why the focus needs to be on strong principles of
sound supervision and risk management, not rules.”  Canada ’s banks didn’t require government bailouts during
the financial crisis and have been ranked the world’s soundest
for the past three years by the Geneva-based  World Economic
Forum .  Waugh said his Toronto-based bank is supportive of higher
 capital requirements , although it has “the potential to stifle
economic growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
