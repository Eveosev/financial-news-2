Telefonica SA (TEF)  lost high speed fixed-
line Internet clients in  Spain  for the first time in February as
people took advantage of cheaper rates offered by competitors,
 Cinco Dias  reported, citing the country’s telecommunications
regulator.  Telefonica had 5.546 million ADSL customers at the end of
February, or 23,100 less than a month earlier, the newspaper
said. Competitors such as  Jazztel Plc (JAZ) ,  France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s
Orange and Vodafone Group Plc are gaining market share, winning
more than 77 percent of new broadband customers in February,
according to the Cinco Dias report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
