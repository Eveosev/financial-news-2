Overseas investors bought a net 40.9
billion rupees ($915.4 million) of Indian stocks on March 31 and
April 1, becoming net buyers of 15.9 billion rupees of Indian
equity this year, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 99.3 billion rupees of shares and sold
58.4 billion rupees on those two days, the  Securities and
Exchange Board of India  said  today . They sold a net 2.47 billion
rupees of bonds, paring their purchases in debt this year to
112.3 billion rupees.  Overseas funds returned in March, after withdrawing 94
billion rupees in January and February on concern accelerating
inflation will prompt further interest rate gains. They bought a
record 1.33 trillion rupees of shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17
percent rally in the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, the
best performer among the world’s 10 biggest equity markets last
year. The Sensex has fallen 4 percent this year.  Foreign funds have placed 4.487 trillion rupees in equities
and 899 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into the
country in 1993. The previous record was in 2009 when flows
reached 834.2 billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18
years. Funds withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in
2008, setting off the worst annual slump.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
