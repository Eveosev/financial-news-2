Japan ’s trust companies plan to
assist rebuilding in areas destroyed by the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami by providing advice on property ownership, said
Takashi Nonaka, the new chairman of the association.  “There are a lot of suggestions we can make when crafting
rebuilding measures,” Nonaka, also president of Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co., said in an interview on April 1, before taking the
chairmanship yesterday. The Trust Companies Association of Japan
will make proposals to central and local governments, he said.  Trust companies can use their know-how to offer
consultation when finding new land plots to build houses for
victims, he said. The magnitude-9 quake off the coast of
northeast Japan and the tsunami caused at least 163,000 people
to evacuate and damaged or destroyed 55,571 houses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
