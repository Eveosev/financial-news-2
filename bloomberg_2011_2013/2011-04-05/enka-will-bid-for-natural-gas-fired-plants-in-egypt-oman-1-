Enka Insaat & Sanayi AS,  Turkey ’s
biggest builder, will bid for natural gas-fired power plants in
Oman and  Egypt  as it seeks to expand in the region, said Tahsin
Kosem, a board member of Enka’s energy unit.  The result of the auction to build the 1,500 megawatts
plant in Oman may be announced next week, Kosem said in an
interview in Adapazari in northwestern Turkey today. The
Egyptian plant may have a capacity of 1,500 megawatts, he said
without providing further details.  Turkish builders including Enka are investing in the Middle
East, mirroring Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s policies
of closer trade ties with neighbors where economic growth beats
averages in the European Union.  Enka rose as much as 1.6 percent on the  Istanbul Stock
Exchange , reversing an earlier decline of 1.1 percent. The share
climbed 0.3 percent to 6.20 liras at 5:30 p.m., when trading on
the bourse closed.  General Electric Co. (GE)  wants Enka to be an engineering and
building partner for power plants, Yavuz Aydin, Turkey and
Israel director for GE’s energy services unit, also said in an
interview in Adapazari.  To contact the reporter on this story:
