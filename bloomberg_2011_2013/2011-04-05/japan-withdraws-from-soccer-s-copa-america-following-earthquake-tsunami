Japan  withdrew from July’s Copa
America soccer tournament as the country deals with the March 11
earthquake and tsunami that devastated its northeast region.  Asian champion Japan had been invited alongside Mexico to
play as guest nations in South America’s continental
championship, which will take place July 1-25 in  Argentina .  “The priority at this moment is to continue saving lives
and rebuilding the country,” Japanese Football Association
president Junji Ogura said on the South American Football
Confederation, or CONMEBOL, website. “We are sorry to be
pulling out.”  CONMEBOL President Nicolas Leoz said in a statement that he
“deeply lamented” Japan’s withdrawal from the 12-nation event
and that he’d consult other members of the organization to
decide what to do with the vacant place in the tournament.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
