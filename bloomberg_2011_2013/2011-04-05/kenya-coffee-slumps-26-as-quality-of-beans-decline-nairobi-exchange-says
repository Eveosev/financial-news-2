Kenya ’s average coffee price fell 26
percent at auction today as the quality of the beans declined,
the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The average price for all the coffee sold dropped to
$244.40 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $331.10 a
fortnight ago, the exchange said in an e-mailed statement. It
didn’t hold a sale last week because of low supplies.  “The quality of the beans continues to deteriorate as we
come to the end of the season,” said Kizito Keya, a coffee
trader at Mumba Coffee Ltd., by phone from Nairobi. “We have a
lot of miscellaneous beans now because there are only two
auctions left.”  Kenya is trying to help small-scale farmers revive
production, which dropped from more than 100,000 metric tons in
1988-89 because of a slump in global prices and farm
mismanagement. The East African nation may produce about 40,000
tons this season, James Wahome, quality manager at the Coffee
Board of Kenya, said on Jan. 17.  The benchmark arabica AA declined 3.6 percent to an average
of $397.06 at today’s sale, as supplies of the grade fell 54
percent to 1,744 bags, the exchange said. Total sales fell 12
percent to 9,245 bags worth $2.76 million, from 10,462 bags
valued at $4.23 million, while supplies dropped 9.5 percent to
15,847 bags, the exchange said.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
