Kenyan banks posted a 53 percent
increase in pretax profit in 2010, said Think Business Ltd., a
Kenyan research group.  Pretax profit climbed to 73.7 billion shillings ($878.6
million) last year while total assets held by lenders in East
Africa’s biggest economy grew 26 percent to 1.8 trillion
shillings, the Nairobi-based group said in a statement handed to
reporters today.  “2010 was the most profitable year in  Kenya ’s banking
history,” Ochieng Oloo, chief executive officer of Think
Business, told reporters today.  Kenya’s banking industry will probably see increased profit
this year as credit to businesses expands, central bank Governor
Njuguna Ndung’u said March 28.  Commercial banks forecast that lending to private industry
may surge by as much as 20 percent over the rest of this year,
Ndung’u said. The banks lent 41.3 billion shillings ($490.5
million) to businesses in January and February, the same amount
that was issued in the entire fourth quarter, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
