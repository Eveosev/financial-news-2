Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and
their partners in the Kashagan oil field in  Kazakhstan  will
complete a design review later this year meant to optimize costs
for expanding the project, the operator said today.  The design will be presented to shareholders and the
government in the second half of 2011, a spokesman for  North
Caspian Operating Co . said today by e-mail, declining to be
identified because of company policy. Once approved, front-end
engineering and design will start, and the cost and schedule
will be worked out, he said.  Kazakhstan may delay Phase II as the partners seek a
simplified design that would cut costs by $18 billion to $50
billion, the  Daily Telegraph  reported today, citing an
identified official. The freeze would delay plans to ramp up to
full production, the newspaper said.  Shell and its partners started a review of the project’s
design in 2009 to ensure that the expansion is “as economically
robust as possible.”  First output from Kashagan, the world’s fifth-largest oil
field, is slated for next year after years of postponements. The
group agreed in 2008 to give the Kazakh government more
royalties and oversight at the Caspian Sea deposit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
