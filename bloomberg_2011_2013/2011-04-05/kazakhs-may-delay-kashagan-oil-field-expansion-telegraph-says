The Kazakh government may halt work
to expand the Kashagan oilfield for three years, the Daily
Telegraph reported, citing an unidentified official.  Kazakhstan may delay the next phase of the fieldâ€™s
development as partners including  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,
 Total SA (FP) ,  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  seek a
different design to cut costs, the newspaper said. The freeze
would delay plans to ramp up to full production, it said.  Galym Tumabayev, a spokesman for KazMunaiGas National Co.,
the state energy company, declined to comment. First output from
Kashagan is slated for next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
