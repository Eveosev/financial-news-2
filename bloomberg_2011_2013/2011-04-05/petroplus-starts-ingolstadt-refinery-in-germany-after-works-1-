Petroplus Holdings AG,  Europe ’s
largest independent refiner by capacity, is starting its
Ingolstadt oil refinery in  Germany  after planned maintenance.  The refinery “is in the process of restarting,” Zug,
Switzerland-based Petroplus said today in an e-mailed response
to questions. The plant can process 110,000 barrels of oil a
day, according to the company’s website.  Radio IN reported on Feb. 18 that the refinery would
undergo repairs in coming weeks and that units would be halted
in a step-by-step manner. The company said in December that a
full shutdown would take place in spring.  Petroplus said on Feb. 3 it expected Ingolstadt to process
50,000 to 60,000 barrels a day in the first quarter because of
the works.  To contact the reporter on this story:
