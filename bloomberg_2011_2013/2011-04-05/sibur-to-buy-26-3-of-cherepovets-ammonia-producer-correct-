(Corrects stake size in headline.)  ZAO Sibur Holding said it agreed to
buy a 26.3 percent stake in OAO Cherepovets Azot, a Russian
ammonia producer.  The deal, subject to regulatory approvals, aims to increase
market value of Sibur’s mineral fertilizer business, Sibur said
in an e-mailed statement today. The stake will be bought from
“a group of investors,” according to the statement.  Cherepovets Azot is controlled by OAO PhosAgro,  Russia ’s
largest maker of phosphate fertilizers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
