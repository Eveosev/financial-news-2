Subir Gokarn, a deputy governor at
the  Reserve Bank  of  India , comments on  interest rates  and the
currency market. He spoke at a conference of business leaders in
Mumbai today.  “Rising interest rates are making your projects little
less attractive, making you little less inclined to invest, but
the alternative to that will be a meltdown. So, a little bit of
pain now, a little bit of medicine now, with the prospect of
less suffering in the future is the way to look at it.  “I want to emphasize that it is not a tradeoff between
growth and inflation. It is tradeoff between growth now and
inflation in future.”  On exchange rates:  “While it is necessary to intervene in order to manage
excessive volatility, which is a disruptive force, managing the
level of the  exchange rate  per se is not desirable in our
situation because we don’t have the level of dependence on
exports as  China  does. Our interests are more evenly balanced.  “Intervention is not costless, it simply transfers the
cost from one constituency of the economy to another.  “At a policy level, when we try and look at the aggregate
of stakeholder interests, it is not very clear that the policy
of intervention, of managing exchange rates is overwhelmingly
superior to the policy of letting the exchange rate float.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
