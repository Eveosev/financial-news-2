Some  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  electronic cash
cards won’t work next weekend, April 9 and 10, nor during the
four days of the Easter weekend, because of the integration of
the bank’s information technology systems with those of Dresdner
Bank,  Handelsblatt  reported.  About 140,000 customers’ cards will be inoperative in
Commerzbank’s own automatic teller machines, in other ATMs and
for making payments in shops if that requires use of pin-codes,
the newspaper said, citing a bank spokesman.  Commerzbank bought Dresdner from Allianz SE in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
