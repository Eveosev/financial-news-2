Australia ’s dollar fell for a second
day after the central bank left  interest rates  unchanged for a
fourth meeting and a government report showed the nation posted
an unexpected trade deficit.  The Aussie weakened from almost a record high against the
greenback after  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens
said the currency’s recent strength was helping to control
prices, damping the need for further rate increases. New
Zealand’s dollar climbed to a four-month high versus the yen
after Finance Minister Bill English said business confidence was
likely to “bounce back” and the nation probably doesn’t need
any more interest rate cuts.  “The RBA statement is consistent with inaction for some
period of time and there’s nothing new in the statement that
would push the Aussie higher,” said  Sue Trinh , a senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in  Hong Kong . “The
Aussie is now going to be disproportionately impacted by
downside data surprises, given the market is extremely long.” A
long position is a bet an asset will rise.  Australia’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.0338 as of 11:50
a.m. in  New York  from $1.0363 yesterday. It touched $1.0417
yesterday, the strongest since it began trading freely in 1983.
The Aussie appreciated 0.5 percent to 87.53 yen from 87.11 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.2 percent to 76.97 U.S. cents
from 76.82. It advanced 0.9 percent to 65.17 yen, after touching
65.28 earlier today, the highest since Nov. 22.  Trade Deficit  Australia had a trade deficit of A$205 million ($212
million) in February, the first time imports exceeded exports
since March 2010, the statistics bureau said today. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a surplus of A$1.2 billion.  The kiwi fell earlier after a report showed business
confidence slumped to a two-year low in the first quarter
following the nation’s deadliest earthquake in 80 years.  A net 27 percent of 690 companies surveyed said they
expected the economy to deteriorate during the next six months,
from a net 8 percent expecting an improvement in the previous
survey, the  New Zealand   Institute of Economic Research  said.  Benchmark interest rates are 2.5 percent in New Zealand and
4.75 percent in Australia, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and  Japan , attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
