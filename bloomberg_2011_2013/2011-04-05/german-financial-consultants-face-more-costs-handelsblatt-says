Financial consultants in  Germany 
face increasing costs as  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government
tightens regulation,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing a draft law
to be approved in Cabinet tomorrow.  Germany’s 80,000 financial consultants may be burdened with
a total of about 100 million euros ($142 million) in costs, a
figure that doesn’t include mandatory liability insurance and
audit report costs, the newspaper said.  Germany has the least regulated market for consultants in
financial products such as closed property funds, the newspaper
said, citing a study by the Consumer Protection Ministry from
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
