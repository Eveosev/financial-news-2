The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 0.2
percent to 1,848.21 at the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the first
drop in three days. The dollar-denominated RTS Index also
declined 0.2 percent to 2,088.64.  The following are among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Norilsk Nickel (GMKN RX) lost 0.8 percent to 7,749
rubles, after announcing it had started buying back $1.2 billion
of its own shares on the open market. The buyback is the
company’s second this year, under a program approved Dec. 28,
Norilsk said.  OAO Raspadskaya (RASP RX) fell to the lowest closing price
since March 15, retreating 1.6 percent to 185.92 rubles after
halting operations at its Siberian Koksovaya mine following an
accident yesterday. The Russian coal producer had increased
output at Koksovaya to compensate for lost production at its
flagship  Raspadskaya (RASP)  mine after 90 miners died in explosions
last May.  OAO  Uralkali (URKA)   shares slipped 0.3 percent to 240.27
rubles, snapping four days of gains after announcing OAO TGK-9
is seeking 2.7 billion rubles ($100 million) of compensation for
damages related to the accident that occurred at Uralkali Mine 1
in 2006. Uralkali said the claims are “entirely without merit”
and it intends to contest them “vigorously.”  VTB Group (VTBR RX) slumped 1.7 percent to 0.09869 rubles,
the first drop in three days, while OAO Sberbank (SBER03 RX)
declined 1.5 percent to 106.92 rubles. Russia’s two biggest
lenders extended losses after  Andrei Kostin , VTB’s chief
executive officer, said “new risks” were forming in the
country’s banking industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
