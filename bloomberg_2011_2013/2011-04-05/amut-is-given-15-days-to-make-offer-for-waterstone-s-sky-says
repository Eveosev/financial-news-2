Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut
has been given 15 days to make an offer for Waterstone’s
bookstore chain, Sky News editor Mark Kleinman reported on his
blog, without citing anyone.   Nomura Holdings Inc., which is advising Waterstone’s owner
 HMV Group Plc (HMV) , has asked Mamut and the chain’s founder Tim
Waterstone, to come up with the offer within that period,
according to Kleinman. The deal may be valued at as little as 50
million pounds, he added.       To contact the editor responsible for this story:
