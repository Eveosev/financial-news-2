U.K. sales of organic products
declined 5.9 percent in 2010 on “fragile  consumer confidence ,”
sliding for a second year, the Soil Association said.  Organic sales fell to 1.73 billion pounds ($2.8 billion)
last year from 1.84 billion pounds in 2009, the Soil
Association, a charity that certifies organic farmers in the
U.K., said in its annual market  report  released yesterday.  This year’s outlook is “cautiously optimistic,” according
to the association, which said on average consumers bought
organic products 15 times in 2010, compared with 16 times the
previous year. Organic farmers avoid the use of chemical
pesticides and fertilizers.  “Given the current uncertainties in the U.K. and global
economy, it would be rash to make any predictions for the future
organic market,” Roger Mortlock, deputy director at the Soil
Association, said in a statement.  “There is powerful evidence that consumers who care about
the diverse benefits of organic will stay loyal, even during
these tough economic times,” Mortlock said, adding 86 percent
of households in the U.K. buy organic products.  U.K. sales of organic products reached a peak level of 2.11
billion pounds in 2008, having climbed from 105 million pounds
in 1993, according to data from the Soil Association.  Sales through multiple retailers, which accounted for 72.3
percent of the organic market in 2010, fell by 7.7 percent to
1.25 billion pounds, the association said.  Organic Milk Production Fell  Supermarket operators Waitrose Ltd. and Marks & Spencer
Group Plc expect “modest growth” in organic sales in 2011,
while Tesco Plc, J Sainsbury Plc and William Morrison
Supermarkets Plc forecast little-changed sales year-on-year, the
association said.  Production of organic vegetables and organic milk fell in
2010, and the association expected poultry and egg production to
fall in 2011, according to the report.  Still, there were “signs of resilience and recovery” for
the industry, with sales of organic beef up 18 percent and
organic baby-food sales climbing 10 percent, the group said.  The amount of organically-managed farmland in the U.K. fell
0.6 percent to 738,709 hectares (1.83 million acres), or 4.2
percent of the country’s surface used for farming, according to
the Soil Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
