Barry Bonds ’s former business
partner spoke with the slugger’s doctor in 2003 about a federal
steroids raid on a  California  lab and told the physician news
reports said his patient was “the main one that they supply
stuff to,” according to a transcript of a tape recording.  U.S. District Judge  Susan Illston  ruled today that the
tape, secretly recorded by the former partner, can’t be used as
evidence at Bonds’s perjury trial because much of the
conversation on it can’t be heard.  It’s “not admissible,” Illston said, noting that much of
what the former partner, Steve Hoskins, said is about “what he
said he read in the newspaper.”  U.S. prosecutors said the transcript of the recording made
by Hoskins shows that he and physician Arthur Ting’s
conversation “was largely about Balco, steroids and the
defendant,” according to court documents filed today in federal
court in  San Francisco . Ting’s response to the statement wasn’t
discernible, according to the transcript. Prosecutors asked
Illston to allow the recording as evidence.  Ting testified that he never spoke to Hoskins about
steroids in 2003, prosecutors said in a filing today.  The Burlingame, California-based Bay Area Laboratory Co-
Operative, known as Balco, was at the center of a U.S. probe
into steroid use among professional athletes.  The case is U.S. v. Bonds, 07-00732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
