U.S. consumer-loan delinquencies
dropped in the fourth-quarter as consumers managed debt and the
unemployment rate fell, the  American Bankers Association  said.  Overall delinquencies across eight loan categories fell to
2.68 percent of all accounts in the three months ended Dec. 31
from 3.01 percent in the prior quarter, the ABA said today in
its Consumer Credit Delinquency Bulletin. Overdue payments on
home-equity loans held steady at 4.05 percent and bank-card
delinquencies dropped to the lowest level in almost a decade.  “Consumers are in better control of their finances and
there are more people who are employed, and that means they have
new sources of income that make it easier to meet their
financial obligations,” James Chessen, the ABA’s chief
economist, said in a telephone interview.  Consumers are benefitting from stock-market gains and
employers created more jobs than forecast in March as the U.S.
 unemployment rate  fell to 8.8 percent, a two-year low, Labor
Department figures showed April 1.  “Looking forward, turmoil in the Middle East has raised
 oil prices  and the nuclear crisis in  Japan  has created
additional uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery,”
Chessen said. “The housing market is still struggling to
recover and the lack of improvement on home-equity loans is a
reflection of that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
