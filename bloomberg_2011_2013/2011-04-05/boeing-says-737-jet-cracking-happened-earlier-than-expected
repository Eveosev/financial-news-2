Boeing Co. (BA)  said metal-fatigue
inspections must be stepped up on older 737s, the world’s most
widely flown jet, after cracks developed earlier than expected
on a  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  plane that split open last week.  Cracks on the so-called 737 Classic weren’t forecast to
occur until “much later,” after 60,000 takeoff-and-landing
cycles, Paul Richter, Boeing’s chief project engineer for older
jets, said today on a conference call. The plane that ripped in
an April 1 flight above  Arizona  had flown 39,781 cycles.  “We are all concerned about this recent development,”
Richter said. He said Boeing is working with airlines worldwide
to ensure that those making frequent, shorter flights, like
Southwest, inspect the jets within five days.  The U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration  said today it will
require inspections for cracks on all 737-300s, 737-400s and
737-500s that have flown more than 30,000 cycles, covering about
175 planes worldwide. The FAA also is taking the rare step of
requiring checks again every 500 cycles as a precaution while
the probe continues, Richter said.  Southwest, the biggest 737 operator, pulled 79 planes from
service after the April 1 incident forced an emergency landing
in Arizona. The Dallas-based carrier found cracks on five
additional 737s, and Boeing has come up with repair plans for
three of those so far, Richter said.  Southwest declined to comment on Boeing’s findings, said
Brandy King, a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based carrier. The
airline said it operated a full flight schedule today.  Fuselage Fasteners  Boeing, based in  Chicago , was aware of the potential for
problems with fatigue around the fasteners that hold the 737
fuselage panels together and changed the design for newer models
of the plane starting in 2000, Richter said.  Boeing is urging airlines around the world to inspect the
lower row of fasteners in the lap joints along the left and
right side of the crown of the planes, a section about 50 feet
long, Richter said. With two inspectors, one for each side, each
check will probably take about eight hours, he said.  The company has “very high confidence” in the inspection
technique with handheld instruments that can find “very short
cracks” using electromagnetic technology, Richter said.  The FAA’s directive eventually will require about 570
planes to be checked, Richter said. Airlines that find cracks
will need to collaborate with Boeing on how best to fix their
aircraft, and will probably need to cut out and replace sections
of the fuselage, he said.  Lap Joints  The Southwest repairs will probably require removing an 18-
inch length of the lap joints and will take 8 to 16 hours per
jet, he said.  The April 1 incident was “a statistical event” and
doesn’t have anything to do with Southwest’s maintenance program
or with how the carrier operates its planes, Richter said.  Boeing knew that the first 737s, which the company began
building in  Seattle  in 1967, would have problems along the lap
joints, and the FAA already has devised inspections and repairs
for those planes, Richter said. The company changed the design
for all 737-300s, -400s and -500s built after 1993, and those
are the ones that weren’t expected to start cracking until they
reached 60,000 cycles.  By 2000, when the models known as Next-Generation 737s
began to be built, the company had developed a new design that’s
“significantly different and much improved,” Richter said.
Engineers were able to reduce how much the metal fuselage bends
when the plane is pressurized as it ascends, he said.  Boeing has built more than 6,000 737s. The single-aisle
jet, along with Airbus SAS’s A320, is the backbone of the
aviation industry, used chiefly on domestic and short-haul
flights.  After Southwest, the biggest operators of 737 Classics are
 Germany ’s  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) , Malaysia
Airline System Bhd. and  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,
according to data from aviation research firm Ascend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
