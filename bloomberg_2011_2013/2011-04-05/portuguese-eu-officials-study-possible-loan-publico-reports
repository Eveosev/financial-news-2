Portuguese and European officials
are assessing a scenario in which Portugal could obtain a short-

Publico reported, citing unidentified people.  As the EU may be reluctant to provide such a loan, the
possibility of Portugal having a  credit line  with the
International Monetary Fund cannot be ruled out, the Portuguese
newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
