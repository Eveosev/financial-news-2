It would be a “grave mistake” for
 Brazil  to allow inflation to exceed the 6.5 percent upper limit
of its target range this year, former central bank president
Persio Arida, said in an interview with Valor Economico
newspaper.  A breach of the target range would harm growth and
investments, and might lead to a monetary “overkill” as
authorities struggle to get inflation back under control, the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper reported Arida as saying.  The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
