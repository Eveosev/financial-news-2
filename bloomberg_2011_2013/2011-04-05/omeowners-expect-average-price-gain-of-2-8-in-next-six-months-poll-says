U.K. house prices will climb 2.8
percent in the next six months as Britons become more confident
about the outlook for the  property market , according to the
average response in a survey of homeowners by  Zoopla.co.uk .  Fifty-nine percent of those questioned said values in their
area will increase, the property website said in an e-mailed
quarterly report today. That compares with 54 percent of
respondents predicting price gains in a survey in the fourth
quarter, with an average forecast of 1.9 percent.  Recent housing data have been mixed as a lack of supply
props up values and demand is hurt by banks curtailing credit
and record low consumer confidence. The prediction for house-
price gains still remains below that of a year earlier, Zoopla
said.  “After almost nine months of falling confidence and
falling house prices, it looks like the property market is now
starting to turn a corner,” Nicholas Leeming, business
development director of Zoopla, said in the report. “We still
remain somewhat short of the confidence levels seen in early
2010 but there has been a clear improvement.”  Zoopla questioned 7,984 people registered with the website
and who are homeowners from March 21 to March 28 for the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
