The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission will meet April 12 to consider a proposed Dodd-Frank
Act rule governing margin requirements for uncleared swaps for
swap dealers and major swap participants, the Washington-based
regulator said in a statement today.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s board will meet the
same day to consider a proposal, mandated by Dodd-Frank, that
would govern capital and margin requirements held by banks in
swap transactions.  Dodd-Frank, the regulatory overhaul enacted last year, aims
to reduce risks in derivatives transactions by requiring firms
to set aside additional capital and post margin after largely
unregulated swaps helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis.  Manufacturers and other commercial “end users” of
derivatives have said that without an exemption from margin
requirements, their businesses would need to divert capital from
expanding or hiring workers. CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  said on
Feb. 10 that regulators shouldn’t impose margin on firms that
use derivatives to hedge business risks.  “Swaps involving non-financial firms don’t carry the same
risk as trades among Wall Street banks,  hedge funds  and other
financial firms,” Gensler told congressional lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
