China  may buy 2 million to 3 million
metric tons of corn before the end of the 2010-2011 marketing
year, the U.S. Grains Council said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “The economic growth in China, and throughout  Asia , is
placing stronger-than-anticipated demands on livestock, poultry
and dairy supplies,” creating more demand for feed, according
to the statement, which followed U.S. Grains Council Chief
Executive Officer Thomas C. Dorr’s visit to China last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
