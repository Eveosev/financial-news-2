Russia ’s government wants “legal
guarantees” that the U.S. won’t use its planned missile shield
in  Europe  to guard against Russia’s nuclear arsenal, Kommersant
reported, citing an unidentified Russian diplomat.  Russia’s strategic nuclear forces should be off-limits for
the system, which the U.S. says is needed to guard against so-
called rogue states such as Iran, the Moscow-based newspaper
said today.  Talks between the U.S. and Russia on resolving the dispute
have reached an “impasse,” the newspaper said.    Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
