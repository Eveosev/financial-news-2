Copper rallied on expectation demand
will outstrip supply, while lead gained to near the highest
price in almost three years on speculation rebuilding from the
Japanese earthquake disaster will spur consumption.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose as
much as 1 percent to $9,424 a metric ton and was at $9,409 at
2:45 p.m. Tokyo time. The metal for May delivery in  New York 
gained 0.6 percent to $4.28 a pound. Markets in  China  are closed
today for a public holiday.  “Copper was still trading in a recent range amid an
absence of Chinese traders, while forecasts for a supply deficit
this year are lending support to prices,” said Hwang Il Doo, a
senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul .
“Lead is benefiting from  Japan ’s disaster,” he said.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  said it will struggle to meet its 2011
production target at the Collahuasi copper mine in  Chile , the
world’s third-largest, after heavy rains reduced output in the
first two months of the year. Production at the mine, which
London-based Anglo operates with Xstrata Plc, was “well below
target” in January and February, the company said.  Teck Resources Ltd.’s Quebrada Blanca copper mine was also
affected by the rains, company spokeswoman Claudia Onetto said
yesterday.  Lead for three-month delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
$2,776 a ton, the highest price since April 28, 2008. LME lead
stockpiles have slid 5.5 percent since Feb. 15, when stocks were
at the highest level since 1995.  Mitsubishi Materials Corp. said yesterday it will boost
lead output by 16 percent in the April-September period to meet
increasing demand for batteries after the Japanese quake. Usage
will outstrip supply by 20,000 tons in 2011 after a surplus of
35,000 tons last year, according to Neil Hawkes, an analyst at
London-based researcher CRU International Ltd.  Aluminum in  London  rose 0.4 percent to $2,644 a ton, while
zinc climbed 0.7 percent to $2,434 a ton. Nickel added 0.4
percent to $25,595 a ton, while tin hadn’t traded as of 2:50
p.m. Tokyo time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
