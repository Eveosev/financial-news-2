Sbarro Inc., the operator and
franchiser of family-style Italian restaurants, received interim
court approval of as much as $16.5 million in interim financing
to fund operations while in bankruptcy.  Cantor Fitzgerald Securities will be the agent, according
to court documents. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley C. Chapman in
 New York  today gave the company permission to borrow the funds
on an interim basis. Final approval of the total $35 million is
scheduled for April 26, court papers show.  The operator of more than 1,000 pizza restaurants worldwide
sought  bankruptcy protection  to eliminate about $200 million in
debt after sales slowed and cheese costs rose.  The chain, based in Melville, New York, listed assets of
$471 million and debt of $486.6 million in documents filed
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.  Sbarro, owned by buyout firm MidOcean Partners, has
struggled since at least August 2008, when it reported losses
because of higher costs for ingredients including cheese, flour
and pasta. Sales have declined as consumers spend less money
eating out. For the quarter ended Sept. 26, Sbarro had a net
loss of $5.3 million, and $12.7 million in cash. Its long-term
debt was $336.1 million.  The case is In re Sbarro,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  for the
Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ), 11-11527.  To contact the reporter on this story:
