Nigerian lender Afribank Plc has
signed a memorandum of understanding with Vine Capital Partners
and Phoenix Acquisition Co. Ltd. concerning its
recapitalization, the bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  The deal “provides a framework for the process by which
Afribank will be recapitalized,” the statement said, without
giving details. The process will be subject to approval by
bank’s shareholders and regulatory authorities, it said.  Vine Capital Partners is an emerging-markets private equity
firm with interests in banking and financial services in Sub-
Saharan  Africa , and comprises local and international firms,
according to the statement.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  fired the chief executive
officers of 8 of  Nigeria ’s 24 banks in 2009 after a debt crisis
threatened the industry with collapse. It bailed out the sector
with 620 billion naira ($4 billion), and Afribank was one of the
beneficiaries of the bailout.  CBN also set up the Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria to
buy bad debts from the nation’s lenders and recapitalize the
rescued banks to zero from negative equity, before matching them
with potential buyers.  Afribank stocks gained 5 kobo, or 2.7 percent, to 1.89
naira by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. The stock has lost 13
percent this year, compared with a 0.1 percent decline in the
Nigerian stock Exchange All-Share Index  over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
