U.S. Gulf crude premiums
strengthened versus West  Texas  Intermediate as Brent oil’s
premium to the U.S. benchmark widened the third consecutive day.  The gap between futures contracts for current delivery for
WTI and for Brent, its European counterpart, widened $1.44 to
$14.03 at 1:03 p.m. in  New York . The differential reached a
record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against Brent.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI strengthened 50
cents to $15.25 a barrel at 12:09 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium
widened 75 cents to $15.75.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI gained $1.75 a barrel to $10. Poseidon’s premium
strengthened $2 to $10.50.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened $2.15 to $9.25 a
barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium strengthened $1.95 to $14.35.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  finished a turnaround at its Baton Rouge
refinery in Louisiana and operations have returned to normal,
Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday.  Allexon said in a Feb. 8 message that work on a fluid
catalytic cracker and associated units would last several weeks.  West Texas Sour’s discount widened 10 cents to $3.35 a
barrel. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium weakened 60 cents to $12.15 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select
widened 25 cents to $15.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
