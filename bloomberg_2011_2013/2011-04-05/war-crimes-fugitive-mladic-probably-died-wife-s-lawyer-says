Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect
Ratko Mladic was already suffering from at least two strokes and
a failing pancreas when he went into hiding a decade ago and
“must have died” since, his wife’s lawyer said.  The former army commander, whose extradition to a United
Nations court has been a condition for  Serbia ’s further
integration with the European Union, left his Belgrade home in
2001 and the family lost all contact with him in 2003, said
Milos Saljic, representing Mladic’s wife Bosiljka, who appeared
in court today on charges for illegal possession of weapons.  Mladic “was already a very sick man” when he went into
hiding, Saljic said. “His first stroke was back in 1996, then
another one in 1999 and he could not survive, he must have
died” without adequate medical care that presumably he had no
access to as a fugitive, Saljic said.  An automatic handgun, a rifle and ammunition were found in
the Mladic family home during a 2008 police search for clues
about the suspect’s whereabouts. Charges were brought against
his wife for possession of the unlicensed weaponry.  She did not deny the charges today, saying only she did not
know about the guns hidden in her home.  Last year, Mladic’s wife and son said they would file a
motion to pronounce him dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
