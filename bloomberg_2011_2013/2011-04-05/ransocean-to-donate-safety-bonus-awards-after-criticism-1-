Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , owner of the
drilling rig that exploded and sank in last year’s fatal Gulf of
Mexico disaster, said top executives will donate to charity
safety bonuses that drew criticism from U.S. Interior Secretary
Kenneth Salazar.  The bonuses, which in aggregate total more than $250,000,
will be given to the Deepwater Horizon Memorial Fund established
by the Vernier, Switzerland-based company after 11 rig workers
perished in the April 20 catastrophe, Transocean said today in a
statement.  Chief Executive Officer Steven Newman and his senior
management team drew criticism from Salazar and other government
officials after a regulatory filing last week said the bonuses
were justified by Transocean’s “best year in safety
performance.” The company’s Deepwater Horizon vessel was
working on behalf of BP Plc on a well called Macondo when a
blowout erupted.  “Nothing is more important to Transocean than our people,
and it was never our intent to diminish the effect the Macondo
tragedy has had on those who lost loved ones, Newman said in the
statement. “We offer our most sincere apologies and we regret
the impact this matter has had on the entire Transocean
family.”  In addition to Newman, the executives who will donate their
bonuses include Chief Financial Officer Ricardo H. Rosa, and
Arnaud A.Y. Bobillier, Eric Brown and Ihab M. Toma, all of whom
are executive vice presidents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
