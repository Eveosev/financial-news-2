The best wind power projects will
cost about the same as new coal-fired plants, said Bloomberg New
Energy Finance Chief Executive Michael Liebriech at a conference
in  New York  today.  Electricity from new, high-quality wind power projects
built today costs about $65 a megawatt-hour, Liebreich said.
Power from a new coal-fired power plant costs about $68 a
megawatt-hour, including carbon price and project finance risk,
fuel prices and environmental controls, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
