Accusations of violence against the
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party won’t stop
the southern African nation from holding elections, the  Zimbabwe
Broadcasting Corp.  said, citing President  Robert Mugabe .  “Conflicts and quarrels” are a feature of politics and
shouldn’t prevent elections from taking place, Mugabe, 87, told
state-controlled ZBC.  Mugabe said the accusations of violence are an attempt by
the  Movement for Democratic Change  party to delay the elections,
ZBC reported on its website. Mugabe shares power with Prime
Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai ’s MDC in a coalition government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
