Russian stocks dropped for the first
day in three after  China  raised  interest rates  for the fourth
time since the financial crisis.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slipped 0.2 percent to 1,848.21 at the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow. OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest lender,
retreated 1.5 percent. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the county’s
largest miner, slid 0.8 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS fell
0.2 percent to 2,088.64.  China raised its benchmark one-year lending rate by 25
basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 6.31 percent,
effective tomorrow, the People’s Bank of China said on its
website today. Today’s increase is the fourth since the global
financial crisis, as the world’s fastest-growing major economy
attempts to restrain inflation.  “Markets have generally been pricing in a soft landing for
the Chinese economy, but with each successive rate rise the
risks rise commensurately,” Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian
shares at CF Global Trading in  London , wrote in response to e-
mailed questions. Russia is “highly geared towards selling
resources to the Chinese, so there’s no surprise in a knee-jerk
sell-off coinciding with the headline,” he wrote.  Norilsk climbed as much as 2.1 percent earlier after the
company said it started buying back $1.2 billion of its shares
on the open market. OAO Raspadskaya, a producer of coal for
steelmaking, dropped 1.6 percent after halting operations at its
Koksovaya mine in Siberia following an accident yesterday.  OAO Polymetal, a Russian gold producer, gained 3.5 percent
as the precious metal rose to a record in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
