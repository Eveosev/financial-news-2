German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has
instructed the Bundesbank not to handle any more transactions
between India and  Iran  related to oil trading,  Handelsblatt 
reported.  The Bundesbank will complete transactions for oil already
delivered, the newspaper said, citing unidentified officials.  The Jewish council in  Germany  asked that Hamburg-based
Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG be closed for its
involvement in the trade, Handelsblatt reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
