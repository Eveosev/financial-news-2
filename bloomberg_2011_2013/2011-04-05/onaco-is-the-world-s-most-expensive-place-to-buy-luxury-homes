Monaco  was the world’s most
expensive luxury residential market for the third straight year
in 2010 because of demand from wealthy buyers in the
Mediterranean principality, which levies no personal income tax.  The average cost of a house or apartment in  Monaco  was
$65,600 a square meter, according to a  global index of luxury
home prices  compiled by Knight Frank LLP, a London-based
property broker.  London  was the second most-expensive market at
$56,300 a square meter, while Paris was fifth at $40,500. The
other three most-expensive locations were also in  France .  Monaco’s biggest deal last year was the purchase of La
Belle Epoque, a 17,500-square-foot (1,600-square-meter)
penthouse, for 240 million euros ($340 million) from Christian
and Nick Candy in September. The buyer, whose name wasn’t
disclosed, came from the Middle East.  “The real success stories in 2010 confirm the advantages
of a global brand and a diversity of demand requirements,” like
in London,  New York  and Paris, said  Liam Bailey , Knight Frank’s
head of residential research. “Tried-and-tested markets with
security of infrastructure and political and legal stability
will outperform in the long run.”  The fastest price growth in the global luxury residential
markets was registered in Shanghai, where there was a 21 percent
increase to $17,700 a square meter, the Knight Frank index
showed. The Chinese city was followed by Mumbai and Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
