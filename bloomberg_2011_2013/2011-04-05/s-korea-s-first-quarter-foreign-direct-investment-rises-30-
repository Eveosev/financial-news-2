Foreign direct investment into  South
Korea  increased 30 percent in the first quarter because of the
recovery of the global economy and expectations that the  Asia ’s
fourth-largest economy will steadily grow.  Investment totaled $2.01 billion in the three months to
March 31, up from $1.54 billion a year earlier, the Ministry of
Knowledge Economy said in an e-mailed statement today. The
preliminary data don’t include short-term capital inflows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
