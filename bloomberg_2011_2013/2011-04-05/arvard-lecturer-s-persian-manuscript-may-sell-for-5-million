A page from a 16th-century
manuscript sold today for 7.4 million pounds ($12 million), an
auction record for any Islamic work of art.  The illuminated sheet was one of the 258 illustrations to
the “Shahnameh” and offered by  Sotheby’s (BID)  in its sale of works
from the collection of the late Harvard lecturer Stuart Cary
Welch. There were five telephone bidders.  “It’s one of the supreme examples of the art of the
book,” the London-based dealer  Brendan Lynch  said.  The sale gave Middle Eastern buyers the chance to acquire
one of the last illustrations from the book, showing King
Faridun transformed into a dragon to test his sons’ courage.  The “Shahnameh” was made between 1520 and 1540 for Shah
Tahmasp. The manuscript was owned by Arthur Houghton II, who
donated 78 paintings to the  Metropolitan Museum of Art  in 1972.  Another 118 paintings were acquired from Houghton’s estate
by the London-based dealer Oliver Hoare. In 1994, Hoare
persuaded the Iranian government to accept these in exchange for
Willem de Kooning’s 1952 painting “Woman III” in Tehran’s
Museum of Contemporary Art. Both were valued at 13 million
pounds at the time and were swapped at Vienna airport, according
to the U.K.’s Independent newspaper.  The Abstract Expressionist canvas was subsequently acquired
by the U.S. collector  David Geffen  in a sale brokered by the
Zurich dealer  Doris Ammann . Geffen sold the painting to the
hedge fund manager  Steven A. Cohen  for $137.5 million in 2006.  The highest price for an Islamic work of art was 
previously the 6.2 million pounds paid for a 17th-century 
Persian carpet at Christie's, London, in April 2010.  Stubbs Horse  George Stubbs is set to become only the sixth Old Master
artist to sell for more than 20 million pounds ($32.5 million)
at auction.  The U.K. painter’s 1765 canvas of a champion racehorse has
a minimum hammer estimate of 20 million pounds at Christie’s
International on July 5, the London-based auction house said
today in an e-mailed statement. The work has a bid from a third
party guarantor to ensure its sale.  “It’s a trophy picture,” Alan Hobart, director of
 London ’s  Pyms Gallery , said. “Horseracing is a global industry.
The money could come from anywhere.”  “Gimcrack on Newmarket Heath, With a Trainer, a Stable-
Lad, and a Jockey” shows a horse who won 27 races. The work was
commissioned by Gimcrack’s owner, Viscount Bolingbroke.  Stubbs Record  The Stubbs was bought at Christie’s by the  Woolavington
Collection  for 12,600 pounds in 1951. The auction record for
Stubbs is 10.1 million pounds for “Brood Mare and Foals” at
Sotheby’s in 2010. His “Whistlejacket” was bought by the U.K.
 National Gallery  in a private treaty sale brokered by Christie’s
for 15.75 million pounds including tax liabilities in 1998,
according to the appraisers O’Toole-Ewald Art Associates, Inc.  Only paintings by Rubens, Rembrandt, Turner and Pontormo
have broken the 20 million-pound auction barrier for Old
Masters. Rubens’s “Massacre of the Innocents” is the most
expensive, fetching 49.5 million pounds at Sotheby’s in 2002. A
drawing by Raphael sold for 29.2 million pounds in 2009.  Freud’s Lover  A Lucian Freud portrait of his lover, valued at as much as
4.5 million pounds, was one of five works by the artist that
attracted 2,500 people to a Moscow exhibition on April 2 and 3.  The first exhibition of works in  Russia  by the U.K. painter
was organized by  Christie’s  to showcase “Woman Smiling” and
four drawings being auctioned on June 28.  The 1958 portrait of Suzy Boyt, mother of four of the
artist’s children, is being sold by a European collector who has
owned it since 1985. The 1940s drawings belong to Kay Saatchi,
the ex-wife of the collector Charles Saatchi. Estimates for each
range from 80,000 pounds to 400,000 pounds.  Russian and Chinese collectors are attracted to Freud’s
classical technique used in a contemporary way, said dealers.
 Roman Abramovich  was the buyer of Freud’s “Benefits Supervisor
Sleeping” at Christie’s in 2008, they said. Its $33.6 million
was an auction record for a work by a living artist.  Banksy’s Hurricane  A 2008 Banksy work painted after  Hurricane Katrina  is being
offered at a London auction. “Nola (Red),” showing a girl
under an umbrella raining blood, is estimated to fetch as much
as 80,000 pounds at Bonhams’s on April 13.  The Bristol, England-born graffiti artist painted more than
a dozen murals in  New Orleans  in September 2008.  “Three years after Katrina, I wanted to make a statement
about the cleanup,” Banksy said on his website. The seller was
gifted the work by the artist and it is verified by Banksy’s
Pest Control authentication office, said  Bonhams .  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
