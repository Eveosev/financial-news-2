Russia’s financial industry is
facing “new risks” as banks loosen lending standards amid
“high” liquidity, said  Andrei Kostin , chief executive officer
of VTB Group, the country’s second-biggest bank.  “There’s a danger of growing new risks in the system,”
Kostin said at a conference in Moscow today. “The market is
rather sluggish, competition is strong, liquidity is high.”  Banks are increasingly lending to related parties and
raising the size of credit lines to companies, while becoming
less vigilant in gauging borrower quality, which poses a
“threat of later accumulation of risks,” according to Kostin.  Lending is set to increase 20 percent this year, central
bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev said today, adding that loan
portfolios gained about 1 percent last month. The regulator has
sought to support lending and economic growth by keeping its
refinancing rate within a quarter-point of record lows.  Retail lending rose 14.3 percent last year after shrinking
11 percent in 2009, central bank data show. That outpaced the
12.1 percent increase in corporate lending after a 0.3 percent
gain in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
