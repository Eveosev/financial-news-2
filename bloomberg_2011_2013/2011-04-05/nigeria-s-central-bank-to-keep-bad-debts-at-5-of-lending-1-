Nigeria ’s central bank aims to keep
non-performing loans to no more than 5 percent of banks’
portfolios as the Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria buys up
toxic assets, the bank’s director of banking supervision, Sam
Oni, said.  “The balance sheet of the majority of the banks has been
restructured, the quality of their balance sheet is quite good
now,” Oni told reporters today in Abuja, the capital.  The state-owned Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria, or
Amcon, bought 1 trillion naira ($6.5 billion) of non-performing
loans under the second phase of its program to rid the country’s
lenders of bad debts, Managing Director Mustapha Chike-Obi said
on March 31. Amcon will issue 30 billion naira in bonds on April
6, Executive Director Foluke Dosumu said this month. The bonds
are part of its 1.7 trillion naira debt program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
