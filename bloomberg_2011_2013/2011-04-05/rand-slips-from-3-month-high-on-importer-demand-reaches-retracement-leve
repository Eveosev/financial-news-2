The rand weakened for a second day
against the dollar as importers took advantage of a rally that
drove the currency to a three-month low to buy foreign exchange.  South Africa ’s currency retreated from the 6.6895 per
dollar rate technical analysts regard as a resistance level. It
declined as much as 0.6 percent to 6.7487 per dollar and traded
0.1 percent down at 6.7205 as of 4:17 p.m. in Johannesburg,
paring its gain since March 17 to 5.3 percent. The rand advanced
0.1 percent to 9.5310 per euro.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated over
the past three weeks as commodity prices rose, boosting the
value of the country’s raw material exports. The benchmark  stock
index  has surged 6.3 percent in the same period, led by mining
companies including Anglo American Plc and BHP Billiton Plc.  “We’ve had a strong run, and at these levels you’re seeing
importer demand for dollars,” Chris Becker, a Johannesburg-
based analyst at Econometrix Treasury Management, which advises
companies on currency transactions, said by telephone.  The dollar-rand rate traded near the so-called 100 percent
Fibonacci retracement level late yesterday, a point that
indicates the South African currency isn’t likely to sustain
further gains. Fibonacci analysis uses ratios, which are based
on the sequence identified by an Italian mathematician in the
13th century, to predict support and resistance levels for
prices. Support is where buy orders may be clustered, while
resistance is where there may be sell orders.  Fibonacci Level  “The dollar-rand has run into some support toward the
Fibonacci projection target just below 6.7000,” Tradition
Analytics researchers led by Quinten Bertenshaw wrote in a note
to clients today. “It is not surprising that this support is
holding firm ahead of the  European Central Bank ’s decision which
many in the market are treating as a watershed moment in so far
as major central bank monetary policy is concerned.”  The ECB will probably raise its benchmark rate for the
first time since 2008 on April 7, adding a quarter of a
percentage point to 1.25 percent, according to all 57 economists
polled by Bloomberg.  Long-term debt gained after the central bank sold 2.1
billion rand ($312.5 million) of 10-year and 25-year bonds at an
auction where investors bid for more of the securities than the
amount on offer. Shorter-term debt declined.  The 6.25 percent security due 2036 rose 11.9 cents to 73.92
rand, driving the yield down 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 8.86 percent. The 13.5 percent bond due 2015 dropped
9.5 cents to 121.32 rand, pushing the yield up 2 basis points to
7.73 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
