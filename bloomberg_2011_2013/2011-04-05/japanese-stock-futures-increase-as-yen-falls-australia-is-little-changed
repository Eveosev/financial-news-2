Japanese  stock futures  rose as the
yen weakened to the lowest level against the dollar in six
months. Australian stock futures were little changed.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest manufacturer of cameras, increased 1 percent from its
closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
largest carmaker, gained 1.4 percent. Shares of Tokyo Electric
Power Co. may be active today after the utility said
contaminated water had stopped leaking from a pit near its
damaged No.2 reactor at Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant. ADRs of
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company, climbed 0.5
percent in  New York  after metal prices rose.  Yen-denominated futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
expiring in June closed at 9,650 in Chicago yesterday, compared
with 9,630 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid at 9,640 in the pre-
market in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. The Bank of New York
Mellon Japan ADR Index fell 2 percent in New York yesterday and
has plunged 11 percent since March 10, the day before Japan was
hit by a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami.  “The yen on a weakening trend again, and the idea that the
drop in production from the earthquake can be covered by the
positive  exchange rate , should give the market a superior
strength,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in  Tokyo  at
Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. The halt in water leaking at the
nuclear plant “should make any excess uncertainty about the
future fade.”  Futures on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index were little
changed today and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index declined 0.2
percent in Wellington.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The index closed little changed yesterday as growing
concern that Federal Reserve policy makers will begin removing
stimulus measures offset optimism about takeover deals.  The dollar rose to a six-month high against the yen
following the release of minutes of the Federal Open Market
Committee’s March 15 meeting. The dollar appreciated to as high
as 85.23 yen today, compared with 84.36 yen at the close of
 stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday. A weaker yen versus the dollar
boosts the value of U.S. income at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum gained 0.4
percent yesterday. Copper futures for May delivery rose for the
first time in three sessions while gold futures surged to a
record closing price.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6 percent by the S&P
500 and 1.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the

average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
