Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  shareholders
should reject the homebuilder’s remuneration report at its
annual general meeting on April 21, according to investment
adviser  Pensions Investment Research Consultants Ltd.   Executive performance targets at the U.K.’s second-largest
house builder by volume aren’t challenging and a bonus of 429
percent of base salary paid to the chief executive of the
company’s North American business is “excessive” for a U.K.-
listed company PIRC said in a note.  “Average executive pay ranks the highest for the sector,”
at Taylor Wimpey, PIRC said. “Total variable pay has the
potential to be excessive for all executive directors.”  PIRC, based in London, provides consulting services to
institutional investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
