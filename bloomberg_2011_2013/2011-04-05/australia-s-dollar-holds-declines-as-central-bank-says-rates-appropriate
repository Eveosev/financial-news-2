The Australian dollar maintained
earlier declines after the  Reserve Bank  left interest rates
unchanged and said “the current mildly restrictive stance of
monetary policy remained appropriate in view of the general
macroeconomic outlook.”  The currency traded at $1.0322 as of 2:34 p.m. in Sydney
from $1.0327 before the announcement and $1.0363 yesterday in
 New York .   To contact the reporter on this story:
