ArcelorMittal (MT)  South Africa Ltd., a
unit of the world’s largest steelmaker, awarded Chief Executive
Officer Nonkululeko Nyembezi-Heita a total of 4.13 million rand
($614,932) last year, down 15 percent on lower bonus payments.  In comparison, Nyembezi-Heita, CEO since March 1, 2008, was
paid 4.87 million rand in salary, bonuses, allowances, benefits
and contributions during 2009, the Vanderbijlpark, South Africa-
based company said in its  annual report  posted on its website.  Bonus payments fell 76 percent to 379,275 rand for 2010,
compared with 1.58 million rand a year earlier, it said.  While Africa’s largest steelmaker posted a profit last year
after a loss in 2009, it slid 23 percent in Johannesburg trading
during 2010, compared with the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s
16 percent gain. The company is struggling to resolve an impasse
with supplier Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., which ended an accord to sell
the steelmaking ingredient at 3 percent above production costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
