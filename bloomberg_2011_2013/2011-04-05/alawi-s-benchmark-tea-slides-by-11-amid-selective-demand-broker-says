The benchmark price of tea in
 Malawi ,  Africa ’s largest producer after Kenya, fell 11 percent
to $2.50 a kilogram (2.2 pounds) at auction, said Tea Brokers
Central Africa, which manages the nation’s tea sales.  “There was good but selective demand,” the broker said in
an e-mailed report today. “Poor leaf was neglected while high
grades met strong competition at dearer rates.”  Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign exchange earner,
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of tea from Malawi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
