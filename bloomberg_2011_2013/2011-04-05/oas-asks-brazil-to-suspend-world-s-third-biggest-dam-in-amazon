The Organization of American States
requested Brazil suspend work on the Belo Monte hydroelectric
project in the Amazon, echoing the protests of Indians and
Hollywood director  James Cameron  who oppose what is set to be
the world’s third-biggest dam.  The OAS’s Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asked
Brazil “to immediately suspend” work on the $11 billion dam 
until it consults indigenous people in a “free, informative and
culturally adequate” manner, according to an OAS memo.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government must also take steps
to protect isolated tribes along the Xingu River where the dam
will be built, according to the memo provided by Altamira, Para-
based Movimento Xingu Vivo, one of six groups that complained to
the Washington-based OAS on behalf of indigenous tribes.  Rousseff’s government has 15 days to respond to the
commission’s letter seeking information about what measures it
has taken to fulfill its treaty commitments to the Inter-
American system, according to the memo.  Brazil ’s Foreign Ministry, in a statement, said the
commission’s request was “hasty and unjustified,” as the
government is taking into account all social and environmental
concerns about the project.  “Avatar” director Cameron, former U.S. President  Bill Clinton  and former California Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger 
gathered in the Amazon city of Manaus last month to voice
concern about the potential environmental impact from the dam.  The dam, which will flood 516 square kilometers (199 square
miles) of the world’s largest rainforest and require the
relocation of about 1,000 Indians, is part of the government’s
plan to boost energy supplies as economic growth accelerates.  Latin America’s biggest economy expanded 7.5 percent last
year, the fastest pace in two decades, and is expected to grow 4
percent this year, according to the latest central bank survey
of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
