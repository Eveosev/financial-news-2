Defending champion  Phil Mickelson 
was grouped with Geoff Ogilvy and U.S. Amateur winner Peter
Uihlein for the first two rounds of the Masters Tournament.  Mickelson’s group is set to tee off at 1:48 p.m. local time
at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, on April 7.  Four-time champion Tiger Woods has a 10:41 first-round tee
time, grouped with U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell and Robert Allenby.  Now golf’s No. 3-ranked player, Mickelson comes into
Augusta after winning the Houston Open, his 39th title on the
U.S.  PGA Tour , two days ago. It was the left-hander’s first
victory since capturing his third Masters a year ago. He also
won the week before his 2006 Masters victory, at the BellSouth
Classic.  Mickelson goes into this week as the favorite at the  Las
Vegas Hilton’s Race and Sports Book  and  William Hill Plc (WMH) , the
biggest U.K. bookmaker with about 2,350 shops.  Woods, the winner of 14 major tournaments, is seeking to
end his 17-month winless run. He has slipped to No. 7 in golf’s
world rankings following a November 2009 car crash that led to
his acknowledgment of infidelity and a subsequent divorce.  It’s the first time since 1997 that Woods, who is also in
the midst of changing his swing with new coach  Sean Foley , has
fallen below Mickelson in the rankings.  Woods last won the Masters, the first of four Grand Slam
event in the men’s golf season, in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
