Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  will consider
expanding its program to lend $20 billion for renewable energy
by 2020 once the goal has been reached, Chairman Chad Holliday
said in New York today.  “We think this is going to be a gigantically large
market,” Holliday said in an interview in New York today at a
Bloomberg New Energy Finance conference. “When we get to $20
billion, we’ll look” at whether to lend more, he said.  The bank, based in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , backed
efforts to restrain greenhouse gas emissions and wants to
support cleaner-burning forms of energy as it also makes loans
to coal and oil companies, the chairman said.  “There’s about 2 billion people in the world that wake up
in the morning that don’t know if they’re going to have clean
water, electricity,” Holliday said. “That’s two in seven
people.”  Holliday said he was pessimistic about the chances the U.S.
will adopt legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions and
encourage renewable energy anytime soon.  “That’s just not going to happen during a recession,”
Holliday said. “We’ve never passed a major piece of
environmental legislation with unemployment above 6 percent.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
