Nanoco Group Plc (NANO) , a U.K. maker of
nanocrystals for solar cells and light-emitting diodes, rose 3.2
percent in  London  after saying it signed a product development
agreement that provides an initial payment of $800,000.  The shares climbed as much as 2.5 pence to 80 pence, their
high for the day, as of 4:19 p.m. local time.  “Following the successful completion of its material joint
development agreement with a major Japanese electronics company,
Nanoco has signed a follow-on product development agreement,”
the company said today in a statement, without naming its
partner.  Nanocrystals, also known as quantum dots, are tiny
particles of a semiconductor material that have different
optical properties than traditional semiconductors.
