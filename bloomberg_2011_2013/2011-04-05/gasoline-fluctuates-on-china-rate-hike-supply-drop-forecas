Gasoline surged to the highest level
since July 2008 on speculation U.S. inventories of the motor
fuel fell a seventh straight week and as the dollar retreated,
increasing the investment appeal of commodities.  Gasoline gained a sixth day as stockpiles probably dropped
1.9 million barrels in the week ended April 1, according to the
median estimate of 15 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News.
The dollar was little changed against the euro as of 2:49 p.m.
in  New York , from a 0.5 percent increase earlier.  “I think there’s going to be another couple of weeks of
stock draws and we’ve had good employment figures and
speculation that the economy is improving,” said  Sander Cohan ,
an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
 Massachusetts .  Gasoline for May delivery rose 3.25 cents, or 1 percent, to
settle at $3.2013 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
That’s the highest settlement for the front-month contract since
July 21, 2008. Gasoline has gained 5.7 percent since March 28.  A Labor Department report on April 1 showed U.S. payrolls
swelled more than forecast and the jobless rate fell to a two-
year low of 8.8 percent.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington . Stockpiles
were at a 13-week low in the week ended March 25, having shed
24.1 million barrels, or 10 percent, since Feb. 11, when they
were the largest in almost 21 years.  ‘Supplies Tightened’  “Supplies have tightened, but we’re in the shoulder
season, and I think we need refinery runs to move up and to see
that refiners are going make some gasoline this year,” said
 Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Gasoline production in the week ended March 25 fell 3.7
percent to an average 8.7 million barrels a day, the lowest
level since February 2010. Refiners operated plants at 84.1
percent of capacity. Refinery rates last week likely rose 0.5
percentage point, according to the survey.  Gasoline widened gains after a Pennsylvania environmental
regulator said that Sunoco Inc. delayed the startup of a fluid
catalytic cracker at its Marcus Hook refinery. The shutdown of
the unit is delaying the return of other units closed since a
March 28 power failure.  The 194,000-barrel-a-day plant supplies fuel to New York
Harbor, the delivery point for gasoline and heating oil futures.
Shutdowns there can increase spot and futures prices.  “We’re expecting draws in product inventories, a build in
crude and delays on startups,” said  Tom Knight , vice president
of trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in Texarkana,  Texas .
“We haven’t seen a significant falloff in demand yet. We
finally have the elements in place for a seasonal rally in
gasoline.”  Crude Stockpiles  The survey projected that crude inventories rose 2 million
barrels last week. That gain would raise stockpiles to the
highest level since Nov. 26, according to department data.  Gasoline also gained as  Brent crude  for May settlement rose
$1.16 to settle at $122.22 a barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Product futures are vulnerable to changes in
Brent because some refineries on the U.S. East Coast process
crude grades priced relative to the European benchmark.  Supplies of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
were unchanged, according to the survey.  Heating oil for May delivery added 1.36 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $3.185 a gallon on the exchange, the
highest level for the contract closest to expiration since Aug.
27, 2008.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 2.3 cents to $3.685 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on
its website. That’s the highest price since Sept. 25, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
