Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators slid for the first time in three
days on forecasts of moderating temperatures that may reduce
air-conditioning use. Shipments to  Florida  also dropped for the
first day in three.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to power plants in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 2.3 percent to 12.2 million
dekatherms (11.9 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg as of 9:30 a.m. in New York.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences rose 1.9 percent to
28.8 million. Residences in Florida were to receive 2.5 million
dekatherms of gas, down 7.1 percent from yesterday, Bloomberg
data show. The decline was the biggest since March 19.  Temperatures in Jacksonville, Florida, hit a high of 73
degrees Fahrenheit (23 Celsius), 3 below normal, early today
before retreating, according to  Weather Underground  in  Ann
Arbor , Michigan. The high tomorrow may be 70, 6 degrees below
normal.  Wholesale gas delivered at the FGT Zone 3 hub, where gas is
delivered into Florida from Texas, fell 10.11 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $4.2549 per million British thermal units yesterday
on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
declined 11.29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $4.2107 per million
Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
