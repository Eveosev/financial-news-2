Canada ’s dollar rose against its
U.S. counterpart for the sixth time in the past seven days as
crude oil, the nation’s largest export, traded at almost a 30-
month high.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, strengthened
against 15 of its 16 most-traded peers as Libyan rebels prepared
to export crude oil for the first time since the conflict began
six weeks ago. Global stocks fell.  “As oil got up through $108 a barrel, the Canadian dollar
was bid,” said C.J. Gavsie, managing director for foreign
exchange trading in Toronto.  The Canadian currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 96.55
cents per  U.S. dollar  at 9:26 a.m. in Toronto, from 96.70 cents
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0357.  Crude oil futures fell 0.3 percent to $108.11 a barrel in
 New York . It touched $108.78 a barrel yesterday, the highest
since September 2008.  The MSCI World Index decreased 0.4 percent and futures on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index also fell as much as 0.3 percent
before trading little changed.  ‘Real Bullish Trend’  “We’ve been on a real bullish trend that may be a little
bit too quick for what the market was able to digest,” Gavsie
said. “Those that see it unable to hit that 96-cent level are
taking a bit of profit and re-establishing short positions.” A
short position is a bet a currency will weaken.  The loonie gained 0.5 percent against the yen to 87.35 as
Canada said it used $124 million of its international reserves
in the March 18 joint action by Group of Seven countries to
weaken the Japanese yen. Canada’s Finance Department posted
details of the intervention on its website today.  Canada used almost half of the $252 million of yen reserves
in the intervention, the  report  showed.  Government bonds  fell today, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 10-year note up two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 3.37 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent security
maturing in June 2020 fell 16 cents to C$101.  Canada will auction C$3.5 billion of two-year notes
tomorrow, according to the Bank of Canada’s website. The
securities mature in August 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
