Indonesia ’s rupiah traded at its
strongest level in almost four years as overseas investors
boosted holdings of the nation’s assets after inflation slowed
for a second month in March. Bonds declined.  Funds based abroad bought $25.8 million more Indonesian
equities than they sold yesterday and increased ownership of the
 country’s bonds  to 212.36 trillion rupiah ($24.5 billion) as of
April 4, from 200.4 trillion rupiah at the end of February,
according to data from the stock exchange and finance ministry.  “Inflation has been well-managed and that’s supporting
appetite for Indonesia’s stocks and bonds,” said Mika Martumpal,
senior market analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “ Bank
Indonesia  will probably keep  interest rates  steady this month,
and continue to allow the currency to appreciate gradually.”  The rupiah was little changed at 8,664 per dollar as of
3:26 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency earlier touched 8,657, the strongest level since
May 2007. It has gained 3.6 percent this year.  The economy may have expanded 6.6 percent in the three
months through March, compared with an earlier forecast of 6.4
percent, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said on
March 16. Consumer prices rose 6.65 percent last month from a
year earlier, from an increase of 6.84 percent in February,
according to official data released on April 1.  Policy makers next meet on April 12. They kept the
benchmark rate unchanged at 6.75 percent last month, after a 25
basis-point increase in February.  Ten-year  government bonds  fell. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 climbed three basis points to 7.86
percent, according to midday prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
