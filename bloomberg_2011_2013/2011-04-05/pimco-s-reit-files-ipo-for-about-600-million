Pacific Investment Management Co.,
manager of the world’s largest mutual fund, plans to raise $600
million in an initial public offering for a real estate
investment trust.  Pimco REIT Inc. will buy commercial and residential
mortgage-backed securities, real estate-related assets and other
financial assets, the  Newport Beach , California-based company
said today in a regulatory filing. The real estate investment
trust, or REIT, will seek to list on the New York Stock Exchange
under the ticker PIMR, according to the filing.  “We believe that the U.S. mortgage finance system is
undergoing historic change,” Pimco wrote in today’s  filing .
“Significant increases in regulation and public policy are
influencing which investors will have the financial ability to
hold real estate-related assets. We believe that private non-
bank capital will represent an increasing share of these assets
in the years to come.”  The REIT’s investments will be led by Dan Ivascyn and  Scott Simon , senior portfolio managers at Pimco. Ivascyn and Simon are
responsible for managing Pimco’s residential and commercial
mortgage portfolio team, the firm said.  Pimco, best known for its fixed-income mutual funds run by
 Bill Gross , has raised at least $6.5 billion since the global
financial crisis began in 2007 for private funds to buy troubled
mortgages and bonds backed by real estate loans. The firm has
raised more than $1.5 billion for a fund called Pimco Bravo, and
expects to raise $2 billion to $3 billion in total before a
final close this year, according to an investor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
