ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the world’s largest maker
of power-transmission gear, will remain “disciplined” in its
spending on acquisitions as it continues to seek possible
targets, an executive board member said.  Ulrich Spiesshofer, who oversees the Zurich-based company’s
discrete automation and motion unit, said his division will
develop “with a lot of momentum,” and he will keep looking for
takeovers. The unit he oversees competes in a market worth about
$100 billion and grows at 6 percent to 8 percent a year.  “You have to be very disciplined when making
acquisitions,” Spiesshofer said in an interview at the Hannover
Messe industrial fair in northern  Germany  today. In January, ABB
completed the purchase of Baldor Electric Co. for about $3.1
billion to expand in the North American market for industrial
motors and drives, strengthening Spiesshofer’s 15-month-old
unit.  The Baldor transaction lifted ABB’s  acquisition spending  to
more than $6.5 billion since 2010.  Last year, ABB tried to acquire London-based Chloride Group
Ltd. but was outbid by  Emerson Electric Co. (EMR)  “With Chloride, we
could have matched Emerson’s offer, but we chose not to,”
Spiesshofer said.  ABB would have more than $2 billion cash left after paying
for Baldor, the company said in a Feb. 17 presentation, and
acquisitions remain on the agenda. ABB still had “some pretty
big strategic holes” to address, Chief Executive Officer Joseph Hogan said at the time. “Regardless of what the cycle is of the
market, these targets are never really cheap.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
