Uganda ’s three main sugar producers
plan to spend a combined $197 million to boost capacity and
diversify their operations, the Uganda Sugar Cane Technologists
Association said.  Kakira Sugar Works , the East African nation’s biggest
producer of the sweetener, will invest $100 million to expand
its sugar and electricity generation capacity, and production of
ethanol, the Kampala-based association said in an e-mailed
annual report today. The company, which is expected to produce
165,190 metric tons of sugar this year, plans to complete the
expansion and the power plant by June 2012, the agency said.  Sugar output in Uganda may climb 18 percent to 350,000 tons
this year, with 99 percent of the output coming from plants
owned by Kakira, Kinyara Sugar Works Ltd., and Sugar Corp. of
Uganda Ltd. according to the report. The East African nation,
which consumes 346,000 tons of the sweetener, imported 130,000
tons last year, of which 67,590 tons was re-exported, it said.  Kakira, which generates 22 megawatts of electricity from
cane fiber known as bagasse, plans to boost that capacity to 50
megawatts, which will enable it to supply 30 megawatts to the
national grid, the agency said. The company has yet to determine
when to open its ethanol distiller, the report said, without
providing further details on either of the projects.  Kakira is owned by Madhvani Group, which says it is
Uganda’s biggest industrial group.  Power Generation  Kinyara Sugar., the second-largest producer, will invest
$70 million in a project that will boost its power generation to
40 megawatts, the report said, without giving a timeframe. Power
supply to the national grid may more than double to 4.5
megawatts by June through the production of an additional 5
megawatts, it said, without giving the current capacity.  Kinyara is 51 percent-owned by Rai Group, a Kenyan and
Mauritius-based agro-forest company. The company is expected to
produce 126,380 tons of sugar this year, the agency said.  Sugar Corp., the smallest of the three major producers,
will invest $27 million in replacing its existing mill as well
as plantation machinery and vehicles for cane transportation,
the report said, without giving further details. The company,
which is jointly owned by the Ugandan government and the Mumbai-
based  Mehta Group , is expected to produce 54,000 tons of sugar
this year, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
