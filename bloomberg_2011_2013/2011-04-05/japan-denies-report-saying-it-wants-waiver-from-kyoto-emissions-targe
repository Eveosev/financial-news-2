Japanese Environment Minister Ryu Matsumoto denied a news report that said the country will seek
an exemption from its commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions
made under the  Kyoto treaty .  “We have yet to decide on such a plan," Matsumoto said
today at a press conference. "We are not even looking into it."  The Nikkei newspaper reported today that  Japan  will request
a waiver to the  Kyoto Protocol  because the record earthquake and
tsunami on March 11 is forcing increased use of fossil-fuel
power plants to deal with an electricity shortage.  Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant,
which releases almost no heat-trapping emissions compared with
 fuel oil , coal or natural gas, was severely damaged in the quake
and tsunami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
