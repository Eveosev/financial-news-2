Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) , the U.S. oil and
gas producer that plans to spin off its refining operations this
year, agreed to sell almost one-third of its stake in an oil-
shale formation to  Japan ’s  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  for $270 million.  Marubeni will receive a 30 percent working interest in
about 180,000 net acres in the DJ Basin of southeastern Wyoming
and northern  Colorado , Houston-based Marathon said today in a
statement. The transaction values the properties at about $5,000
an acre, Marathon said. Marubeni is a Japanese trading company.  U.S. companies Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Chesapeake
Energy Corp. are among the companies that have agreed to sell
assets to non-U.S. companies seeking to boost reserves. Marathon
started leasing acreage in the DJ Basin last year, and it’s
acquiring seismic data with plans to be part of eight to 12
gross exploration wells by the end of this year.  “Marathon is pleased to partner with Marubeni as we
prepare to explore and evaluate the full potential of this
emerging, liquids-rich resource play,” Dave Roberts, an
executive vice president at Marathon, said in today’s statement.  Marathon said the companies expect the transaction to close
by April 28. Marathon’s stock was unchanged in after-hours
trading at $53.43.  To contact the reporter on this story:
