Hundreds of boxes of documents
detailing methods used to try to defeat  Kenya ’s Mau Mau
insurgency against British colonial rule in the 1950s have come
to light, the London-based Times reported.  The discovery of the documents, which were removed from
Kenya in 1963, days before the African country’s declaration of
independence, resulted from a legal case against the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office brought by four elderly Kenyans who allege
that they were tortured during the uprising, the newspaper said.  The four, who claim they suffered “unspeakable acts of
brutality, including castrations and severe sexual assaults”
under a system of torture practised by the colonial authorities,
want a government statement of regret and a welfare fund for the
surviving victims, the Times said.  David Anderson, a professor of African history at Oxford
University, said the papers were “hidden away to protect the
guilty,” the newspaper reported.  The case opens in  London ’s High Court on April 7; the
Foreign Office says it’s not legally liable, the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
