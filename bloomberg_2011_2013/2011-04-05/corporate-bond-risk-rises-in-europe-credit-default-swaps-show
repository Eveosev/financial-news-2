The cost of insuring against default
on European financial bonds fell to the lowest in five months,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on 25 banks and
insurers declined for a fourth day, dropping 0.5 basis point to
128.5, the lowest since Nov. 4, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co. at 12 p.m. in  London . The subordinated index tumbled 10
basis points to 231, the lowest since Nov. 19.  The cost of insuring corporate bonds rose. The Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings increased 2 basis points to 370. The Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade
ratings advanced 0.5 basis point to 97.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
