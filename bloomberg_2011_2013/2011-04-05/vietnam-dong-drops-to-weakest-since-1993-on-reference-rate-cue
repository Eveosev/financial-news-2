The Vietnamese dong dropped to its
weakest level against the dollar since 1993 as the central bank
set the currency’s reference rate lower. Government bonds were
steady.  The  State Bank  of  Vietnam  set the reference rate at 20,713,
compared with 20,703 yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate. Policy makers are seeking to narrow the gap between
official and unofficial market rates, said Marc Djandji, the
head of research at Viet Capital Securities.  “The objective that the bank has now by changing the
 exchange rate  is just to close that gap and make it more
attractive for people to go through the official market,” Ho
Chi Minh City-based Djandji said.  The dong declined 0.2 percent, the most since Feb. 24, to
20,918 per dollar as of 5:00 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 20,920,
the weakest level since June 1993.  Government bonds  were steady, with yields on benchmark
five-year notes little changed at 11.93 percent, according to a
daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
