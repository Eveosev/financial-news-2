(Corrects assets under management in third paragraph.)  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , the Swiss
wealth manager making Asia into its second home market, named
Kerry Goh as head of its new Zurich-based Asia investment team
for European clients.  The team of two was moved from Singapore to give Baer’s
private bankers in Switzerland and  Europe  “better access to
Asian investments,” said Jan Vonder Muehll, a spokesman for
Switzerland’s fifth-biggest money manager.  Baer aims to increase client assets in Asia to 25 percent
of the total in five years’ time from 10 percent to 15 percent
now, Vonder Muehll said. Baer now has 170 billion Swiss francs
($184 billion) in assets under management, of which about a
quarter is related to its Swiss business.  Goh is responsible for introducing and maintaining “our
best ideas for investing in  Asia  in the current market
environment,” Vonder Muehll said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
