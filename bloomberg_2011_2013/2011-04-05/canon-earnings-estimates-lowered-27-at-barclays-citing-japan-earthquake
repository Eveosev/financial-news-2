Canon Inc. (7751) ’s earnings this year will
probably be 27 percent lower than previously estimated after
last month’s earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  damaged factories
and choked supply of components,  Barclays Plc (BARC)  said.  Net income at the world’s largest camera maker may be 233
billion yen ($2.8 billion) in 2011, Masahiro Nakanomyo, an
analyst at Barclays in Tokyo, wrote in a report yesterday.
Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, will probably be 400 billion yen, or 17
percent lower than estimated, according to the report.  Extensive damage at Canon’s plant in Utsunomiya, Tochigi
prefecture, and difficulty in getting parts and materials will
likely pressure production of cameras, lenses, copiers and chip-
making equipment, according to Barclays. MF Global Holdings Inc.
last week trimmed its annual profit forecast for Canon by 1.9
percent.  Production will probably return to normal from the quarter
starting in July, Barclays said. The bank kept unchanged its
estimate for the company’s operating profit for 2012. The camera
maker’s three factories in Tochigi, Ibaraki and Miyazaki
remained shut as of yesterday.  The Tokyo-based company may also book an expense for
inventory disposal and valuation losses stemming from the
earthquake, it said.  Canon fell 1.8 percent to 3,585 yen as of 1:50 p.m. in
 Tokyo  trading. The stock has slid 6.4 percent since the March 11
earthquake that left more than 27,000 people dead or missing.  -- Editors: Vipin Nair, Young-Sam Cho  To contact the reporter on this story:
