Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the
second-largest U.S. phone company, paid the U.S. $93.5 million
to resolve allegations it overcharged the U.S. General Services
Administration.  The U.S. Justice Department and the GSA, which supports
federal agencies with products and communications, found New
York-based Verizon submitted false claims for reimbursement of
property taxes, common-carrier recovery charges and unallowable
surcharges, according to an e-mailed statement from the Justice
Department announcing the settlement.  “Corporations that contract to provide services to
federal, state and local governments must play by the rules,”
Assistant Attorney General  Tony West  said in the statement.  The whistle-blower lawsuit was filed on behalf of the
government by Stephen M. Shea and 2Probe LLC, according to the
statement.  “Verizon cooperated closely with the government throughout
the process,” Peter Lucht, a Verizon spokesman, said in an
interview. “It was in the best interest of all parties to
settle the matter. The government and Verizon disagreed on
whether certain fees could be charged under the contract, so
their settlement concludes the efforts by both parties to
resolve the dispute amicably.”  AT&T Inc. (T) , based in Dallas, is the the largest U.S. phone
company.  The case is U.S. v. Verizon Communications Inc., 07-cv-111,
U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
