South Africa ’s FTSE/JSE  Africa  All
Share Index gained for a fourth day, adding 256.61, or 0.8
percent, to 32,887.47 the 5 p.m. close of trade in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Andulela Investment Holdings Ltd. (AND)  , the investment
group, had its biggest decline this year, dropping 9 cents, or

conditions for its acquisition of Pro Roof Steel Merchants Ltd.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , the world’s third-largest
gold producer, rose to the highest in a month, gaining 6.76
rand, or 2 percent, to 338 rand. Gold climbed to a record for a
second day as the sovereign-debt crisis in  Europe  deepened after
Moody’s Investors Service cut  Portugal ’s credit rating and
higher grain and oil prices worsened the inflation outlook.  Gold
Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , the fourth-biggest producer, rallied for a
seventh day, the longest streak of gains since September 2007,
adding 2.75 rand, or 2.3 percent, to 123.50 rand. Harmony Gold
Mining Co. (HAR SJ), Africa’s third-largest producer, snapped
two days of losses to advance 3.15 rand, or 3.2 percent, to
103.25 rand.  Basil Read Holdings Ltd. (BSR)  , the construction
company, increased the most in 18 months, rising 66 cents, or
5.6 percent, to 12.50 rand. The company said its Majwe joint
venture was awarded a “multi-billion rand” mining services
contract by Debswana Diamond Co. in Botswana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
