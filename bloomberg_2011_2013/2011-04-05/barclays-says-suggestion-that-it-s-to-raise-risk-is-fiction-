Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s third-
largest bank, denied a report that it plans to increase the risk
it takes to boost profitability.  Barclays shares declined 0.5 percent in London today after
the Financial Times said Barclays will increase its risk profile
in the next three years. The shares fell to 286.75 pence at the
close of trading, the second-worst performance among Britain’s
five biggest banks.  The bank’s return on equity, a measure of profitability,
may fall below 7 percent this year from 7.2 percent last year,
the FT said. The lender set a goal of achieving a return on
equity of 13 percent by 2013. The London-based bank may consider
buying credit-market assets valued at as much as $20 billion,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the
bank’s thinking.  “The suggestion that we are looking to increase our risk
appetite is fiction,” a Barclays spokeswoman said by telephone.
Analysts estimate the lender’s return on equity, a measure of
profitability, will be 7.9 percent this year, Barclays said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
