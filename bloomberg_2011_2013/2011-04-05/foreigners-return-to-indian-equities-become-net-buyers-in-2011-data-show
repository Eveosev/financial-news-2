Overseas investors have become net
buyers of Indian stocks this year, reversing outflows in the
first two months, based on preliminary data from the National
Stock Exchange and the market regulator.  Foreigners bought a net 43.5 billion rupees ($977 million)
of equities on March 31, April 1 and April 4, bourse data show.
That more than offset net outflows of 25 billion rupees from
Jan. 3 through March 30, according to the most recent  data  on
the Securities and Exchange Board of  India ’s website. The
regulator may update its figures later today.  Overseas funds returned in March, after withdrawing 94
billion rupees in January and February on concern accelerating
inflation will prompt further interest rate gains. They bought a
record 1.33 trillion rupees of the shares in 2010, helping fuel
a 17 percent rally in the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index,
the best performer among the world’s 10 biggest equity markets
last year.  In 2009, 834.2 billion rupees of inflows sparked the
Sensex’s biggest advance in 18 years. Funds withdrew a record
530 billion rupees in 2008, setting off the worst annual slump.  The Sensex has fallen 4.5 percent this year.  Foreign funds have acquired a net 4.446 trillion rupees of
Indian equities and 901.4 billion rupees of bonds since they
were allowed in 1993, data from the regulator show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
