The European Bank for Development
and Reconstruction will revise its Bulgarian economic growth
forecast to nearer to 3 percent from 2.6 percent,  Dnevnik 
reported, citing the bank’s chief economist, Erik Berglof.  Bulgaria ’s economy is recovering from recession mainly due
to increasing exports, which is an encouraging sign, Berglof
said, according to the newspaper. The government’s tight fiscal
policy has helped the country weather the global financial
crisis fairly well, Dvenik reported him as saying. The main
hindrance to Bulgaria’s economy and exports is poor
infrastructure, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
