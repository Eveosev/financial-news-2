(Corrects to whom Furlong reports in third paragraph.)  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  will rename its
U.S. consumer lending business BMO Harris Bank, from Harris
Bank, after it completes its $4.1 billion takeover of  Marshall &
Ilsley Corp. (MI)   Canada ’s fourth-biggest bank will also reorganize its U.S.
management structure, tapping M&I executives for new roles, the
Toronto-based bank said in an e-mail.  Bank of Montreal agreed Dec. 17 to buy Milwaukee-based M&I
in a deal that will double the Toronto-based lender’s U.S.
deposits and branches and extend the reach of its Chicago-based
bank beyond the Midwest. Mark Furlong, M&I’s chief executive
officer, becomes CEO of BMO Harris Bank, reporting to Bank of
Montreal CEO William Downe.  Brad Chapin, M&I’s consumer banking head, will become
executive vice president of personal banking for  Wisconsin ,
Minnesota, Arizona and Florida, while Chris McComish, Harris’
head of retail banking, will become executive vice president of
personal banking for Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and Kansas and
co-head of North American specialized sales.  M&I’s wealth management head, Ken Krei, becomes executive
vice president of global private banking, which includes
oversight on Canada’s private banking business. Ann Benschoter,
head of M&I’s corporate banking, becomes executive vice
president, P&C headquarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
