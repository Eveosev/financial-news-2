Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose
0.3 percent to 4,900.1 as of the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in
Sydney.  New Zealand ’s  NZX 50 Index (NZSE50FG)  advanced 0.3 percent to
3,469.38 in Wellington, its 15th day of advance. That’s the
longest streak of consecutive gains since Bloomberg began
collecting data on the index in 2001.  The following were among the most active shares in the
market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company
names.        Bandanna Energy Ltd. (BND)   fell 1.6 percent to A$1.795.
The company is preparing a A$1 billion sale of assets, with
interested buyers comprising parties from India and  China , the
Australian Financial Review reported in its Street Talk column,
without saying where it got the information.        Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN)   gained 1.1 percent to A$7.43.
 Minmetals Resources Ltd. (1208)  (1208 HK), a unit of China’s biggest
metals trader, may need to raise its unsolicited cash offer for
Equinox by about 29 percent to win over investors in the copper
producer.  “If you’re long-term shareholders and willing to own this
for the next two to three years, this offer, C$7 a share, is
nothing,” said Huy Hoang, a fund manager at Singapore-based HDH
Capital Management Pte, which owns about 1 million shares in
Equinox. He said C$9 a share is just the “starting point.”        Extract Resources Ltd. (EXT)   increased 3.1 percent to
A$8.23. Extract’s Husab project in Namibia, expected to become
one of the three biggest uranium mines in the world, will cost
an estimated $1.66 billion to develop, the Australian explorer
said. Extract, about 14 percent-owned by Rio Tinto Group, is
talking with potential customers and has “identified several
possible strategic contracting opportunities,” the company said.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO AU), the world’s second-largest mining
company by sales, gained 0.8 percent to A$86.16. Rio may double
a share buyback plan to $10 billion after purchasing $800
million of stock, or 16 percent of the program announced in
February, Nomura International Ltd. said.  New Zealand:       NZX Ltd. (NZX)   climbed 0.9 percent to NZ$2.18 in
Wellington after the operator of the New Zealand stock exchange
said share trading volume in March rose 24 percent from a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
