Fairfield Sentry Ltd., a feeder fund
that invested in the Ponzi scheme of  Bernard Madoff , sued the
Abu Dhabi Investment Authority to try to recover $300 million in
redemption payments.  Fairfield Sentry, citing a $3.2 billion lawsuit against it
by Madoff trustee  Irving Picard , has been filing so-called
clawback actions aimed at recouping money. Funds it received
from the jailed conman were passed on to its own shareholders as
redemption payments, it said in an April 1 bankruptcy court
filing.  “Unless redemption payments paid to shareholders are
recovered for the funds’ estate, the funds will be unable to
satisfy their liabilities and claims,” it said in the filing.  The Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund is due to respond to
the lawsuit in May, according to court records.  Fairfield Sentry is being liquidated in the British Virgin
Islands and has a U.S. proceeding to protect its U.S. assets.  Euart Glendinning, a spokesman for the investment
authority, didn’t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment
outside of regular business hours in the United Arab Emirates.  The case is Fairfield Sentry Ltd. v. Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, 11-01719,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of
 New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
