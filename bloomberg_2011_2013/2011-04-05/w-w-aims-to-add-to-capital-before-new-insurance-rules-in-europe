Wuestenrot & Wuerttembergische AG (WUW) , a
German insurer and home lender, said it will increase its
capital buffers by a third by retaining earnings over the next
five years as regulators plan stiffer rules for European
insurers’ reserves.  “We aim to add about 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) to our
equity capital over the next five years to comply with tightened
capital requirements,” W&W Chief Executive Officer Alexander Erdland said at a press conference today at its headquarters in
Stuttgart,  Germany . The insurer had 2.84 billion euros of equity
capital at the end of last year.  The company aims for 180 million euros in profit this year
after 188 million euros in 2010, it said. The figure is expected
to rise to a “sustainable level” of 250 million euros in 2012,
Erdland said. W&W acquired home-loan provider Allianz Dresdner
Bauspar AG from Frankfurt-based Commerzbank AG last year.  Insurers’ capital requirements are set to rise in  Europe 
with Solvency II, a proposed new risk-based regulation regime
for insurers in Europe scheduled to come into effect in 2013.  About 66 percent of W&W is  owned  by the  Wuestenrot Stiftung 
foundation, 7.8 percent is publicly traded and the rest is held
by financial institutions including Landesbank Baden-
Wuerttemberg, Italian lender UniCredit SpA and Zurich-based
reinsurer Swiss Reinsurance Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
