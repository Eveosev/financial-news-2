Continental AG (CON) ,  Europe ’s second-
largest auto-parts maker, received its first credit-rating
upgrade from Moody’s Investors Service in six years in a sign
that the debt-laden company’s finances are turning around.  Moody’s raised the company’s rating today by one notch to
Ba3, three levels below investment grade. The outlook for the
rating, which affects about 3 billion euros ($4.25 billion) of
debt, is stable, the credit-rating service said. The rating was
last raised in April 2005, when it was increased by one level to
Baa1, the third-lowest investment grade.  “Today’s rating action reflects both a stronger-than-
expected recovery in Conti’s operating performance for the
fiscal year 2010 as well as a significant improvement of Conti’s
liquidity profile,” Falk Frey, an analyst at Moody’s in
 Frankfurt , said in the statement.  Continental has been working to reduce debt after
borrowings soared because of the 2007 acquisition of Siemens
AG’s VDO car-parts unit for 11.4 billion euros. The component-
maker sold 1.1 billion euros in new shares last year to help cut
net debt at the end of 2010 to 7.3 billion euros from 8.9
billion euros a year earlier.  The manufacturer arranged a 6 billion-euro loan package
last month with more than 35 banks to cut borrowing costs and
refinance payments that would have been due next year.
Continental, which is also Europe’s second-largest tiremaker,
aims to lower the ratio of net debt to equity to about 70
percent from the Dec. 31 figure of 118 percent, as it targets a
return to an investment-grade rating by 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
