Gold futures surged to a record of
$1,458.60 an ounce as sovereign-debt concerns boosted demand for
the precious metal as an alternative asset. Silver prices topped
$39 an ounce.  The cost of insuring  Portugal ’s debt rose to an all-time
high. The conflict in Libya and the nuclear crisis in  Japan 
spurred demand for gold as an investment haven. The metal has
jumped 28 percent in the past year, and silver more than
doubled.  “There’s still turmoil in the Middle East, uncertainty in
Japan and possible sovereign-debt defaults,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in
 Chicago . “There’s still demand for gold and silver as a hedge
against chaos.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $19.50, or 1.4 percent,
to settle at $1,452.50 at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
the highest closing price ever. The metal extended its rally to
a record after the end of regular trading.  Gold for immediate delivery rose as much as 1.6 percent to
an all-time high of $1,457.45.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday said
that inflation must be watched “extremely closely,” spurring
bets that  interest rates  may be raised sooner than analysts
expected. The  European Central Bank  has signaled it is ready to
raise borrowing costs this week. Today,  China  raised rates for
the fourth time since mid-October to restrain increasing
consumer prices.  Inflation Bite  “Once a central bank goes down the expansionary path to
fight recession, it is much easier to keep pumping money than to
reverse course when inflation starts to bite into purchasing
power,” said  Michael Pento , a senior economist at Euro Pacific
Capital Inc. in New York.  The Fed has kept its benchmark rate at zero percent to 0.25
percent since December 2008 to stimulate the economy. President
Barack Obama is negotiating with congressional leaders to
prevent a government closure as the budget deficit soars.  “What’s looming ahead is the fear that if there is a
shutdown in government, who’s going to want to own paper
currency?” Klopfenstein of Lind-Waldock said.  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter, told clients to sell Japanese
equities and buy gold.  Japanese stocks fell the most in three weeks after Tokyo
Electric Power Co. began dumping radioactive water from its
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station into the sea.  The previous intraday record for gold was $1,448.60 on
March 24.  Silver, Palladium  Silver futures for May delivery climbed 68.9 cents, or 1.8

regular trading, the price reached $39.33, the highest since
February 1980. That year, the metal soared to a record of
$50.35.  Palladium futures for June delivery advanced $8.70, or 1.1
percent, to $793.10 an ounce on the  New York  Mercantile
