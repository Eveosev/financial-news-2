Kumar Sangakkara, who led  Sri Lanka 
to the Cricket  World Cup  final, is resigning as captain of the
country’s one-day and Twenty20 squads.  Sangakkara, 33, spoke to the country’s selectors after the
team lost the final by 6 wickets to India three days ago, and he
has proposed continuing as captain of the Test team for series
against England and  Australia , he said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “This was a decision I made prior to the 2011 World Cup,”
the wicketkeeper said in the statement. “I will be 37 by the
next World Cup and I cannot therefore be sure of my place in the
team. It is better that Sri Lanka is led now by a player who
will be at the peak of their career in that tournament.”  He was the third-highest run producer in the 2011 World
Cup, scoring 465 runs in 8 innings, and was not out in three of
them. Only teammate Tillakaratne Dilshan, with 500 runs, and
 India ’s Sachin Tendulkar, with 482, surpassed Sangakkara, who
had one innings fewer than both.  Sangakkara made his national team debut against Pakistan in
a one-day game in July 2000, before appearing in a Test match
against South Africa later that month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
