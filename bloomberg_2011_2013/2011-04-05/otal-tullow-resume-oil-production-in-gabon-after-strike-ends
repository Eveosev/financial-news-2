Total SA (FP)  and Tullow Oil Plc said 
they are resuming crude production in Gabon after a four-day
oil workers’ strike ended.  Tullow is ramping up production following an agreement
between the government and unions, George Cazenove, a company
spokesman, said by e-mail today.  “We should get back to normal production by today,”
Phenelope Semavoine, a Total spokeswoman in Paris, said by
phone. The company’s oil output in Gabon was 67,000 barrels of
oil equivalent last year, she said.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is also bringing production back “to
normal,” Kirsten Smart, a London-based spokeswoman at the
company, said by phone.  Shell pumped 34,000 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids
a day in  Gabon  last year, according to the  company annual
report . Tullow pumped a net 12,850 barrels of oil a day from 13
fields in Gabon in 2011, it said last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
