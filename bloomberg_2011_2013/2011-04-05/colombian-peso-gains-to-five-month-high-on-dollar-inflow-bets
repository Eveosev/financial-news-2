Colombia’s peso rose to a five-month
high on speculation dollar inflows will increase as the
government brings in funds left abroad last year.  The peso climbed 0.8 percent 1,835.25 per  U.S. dollar  at
1:34 p.m. New York time, from 1,849.25 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,834.20, its strongest level since Nov. 9.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in October that
the government would keep $1.5 billion overseas “at least for
the first months of 2011,” in a bid to ease gains in the peso.
Echeverry has said the government will bring the money in
“slowly” in 2011. An official at the  Finance Ministry  declined
to comment on whether the government was bringing dollars into
the country.  “The most effective measure to stem peso gains was the
government’s decision to delay the repatriation of those
dollars,” said Daniel Velandia, head analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Correval SA. “Once that restriction is out of the
way, the peso should continue its strengthening trend.”  The peso has dropped 2 percent in the last six months.  Colombia ’s peso bonds fell for the first day in four before
today’s March inflation report. The national statistics agency
is slated to release the monthly consumer price report at 8 p.m.
New York time.  The yield on the Colombian government’s benchmark 11
percent bonds due July 2020 rose 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 8.17 percent, according to Colombia’s stock
exchange. The bond’s price dropped 0.224 centavo to 117.862
centavos per peso.  Annual inflation quickened to 3.37 percent last month,
according to the medium estimate of 24 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The central bank targets inflation between 2 percent
and 4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
