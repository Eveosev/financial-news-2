Georgia ’s Black sea port of Batumi
halted work today because of a suspicious radioactive substance
hidden among scrap metal, said Levan Gogua, the main specialist
in the Environment Ministry’s nuclear safety department.  “Our colleagues are already traveling there to find out
whether the substance found in Batumi port is CS-137,” Gogua
said today by phone.  CS-137 is one of the radioactive isotopes that may be
released in a nuclear accident such as that which occurred last
month after  Japan ’s earthquake and tsunami.  Gogua said the radioactive substance was found by the
port’s detectors and the scrap metal will be searched again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
