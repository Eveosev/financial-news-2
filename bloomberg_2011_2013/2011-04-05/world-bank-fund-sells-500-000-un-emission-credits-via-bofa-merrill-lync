The World Bank-managed Adaptation
Fund sold 500,000 metric tons of United Nations-overseen
Certified Emission Reduction credits via Bank of America Merrill
Lynch for an unspecified price.  Since the start of a program in May 2009, the  World Bank 
has sold more than $148 million worth of CERs, it said today in
an e-mailed statement.  “The Adaptation Fund is an innovative means of financing
projects in those developing countries most at risk from climate
change,’’ Abyd Karmali, global head of carbon markets at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
