Andy Bond , the former chief
executive officer of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s Asda chain, added to
the woes of the British retail sector by forecasting the
“retail recession” is still ahead.  This year “and 2012 will be very tough,” Bond said at the
Retail London conference today. “We’re going to see an extended
period of constrained consumption.”  Bond, who spent 16 years at the U.K.’s second-largest
supermarket chain and was CEO for five, expects a “long, long-
term trend of trading down,” and an attitude amongst consumers
of “more is less.” Bond, who was replaced by Andy Clarke a
year ago, said the retail market hasn’t yet been in recession.  U.K. retailers including Dixons Retail Plc have said full-
year earnings will miss analysts’ estimates amid declining
consumer confidence. Marks & Spencer Group Plc is forecast to
report a 6 percent drop in sales of general merchandise when it
publishes fourth-quarter sales tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
