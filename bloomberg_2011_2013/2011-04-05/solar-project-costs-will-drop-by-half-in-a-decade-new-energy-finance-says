The cost of developing a solar power
project will fall by half in the next decade worldwide, making
energy from the sun more competitive with fossil fuels,
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimated.  “The most powerful driver in our industry is the
relentless reduction of costs,” said Michael Liebreich,
chairman of the research group, at a conference in  New York 
today. “In a decade the cost of solar projects is going to
halve again.”  The cost of large solar photovoltaic projects, now $3.02 a
watt for the power generated, will decline to $1.45 a watt in
2020, New Energy Finance said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
