Iraq will be unable to pass its oil
and revenue-sharing laws by this summer because of ongoing
political disagreements, the chairman of the Iraqi parliament’s
Oil and Energy Committee said in  London  today.  Passage of the law by June or July is “unfeasible,” Adnan Al-Janabi said at a conference organized by the London-based
Centre for Global Energy Studies. He said he hopes the law will
be passed by the end of the year.  Still, Iraq is making progress with some of its energy
disputes, Al-Janabi said. The Kurdistan region in the north is
exporting a combined 100,000 barrels a day of crude and
condensate, following an agreement with the central government
on payments to foreign companies in Kurdistan, and the central
government’s 2011 budget provides for the payment of 200,000
barrels a day, he said.  The Oil and Energy Committee has begun consultations on how
to make contracts signed between the Kurdish authorities and
foreign companies compatible with national laws, Al-Janabi said.
That process will require co-ordination between the committee,
the Kurds and the Ministry of Oil.  Al-Janabi said it is “not reasonable or rational” for  Iraq 
to increase production to 12 million barrels a day, one of the
targets set by the government. The nation pumped 2.6 million
barrels a day last month, according to Bloomberg estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
