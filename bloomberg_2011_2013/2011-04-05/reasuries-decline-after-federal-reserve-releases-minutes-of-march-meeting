Treasuries fell, pushing yields up,
after the  Federal Reserve  released minutes of its March 15
meeting, where policy makers said the recovery is gaining
strength while reaffirming plans to buy $600 billion of
Treasuries through June.  Two-year yields earlier touched a one-week low. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the economic recovery is
not yet solid and an increase in inflation may be transitory.
The central bank authorized its debt-purchase program, the
second round of a strategy called quantitative easing, in
November to spur economic recovery.  “The thought that QE2 will end early or the Fed is going
to raise rates is probably a little bit ahead of itself,” Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors, said before the minutes were released.  Two-year yields increased six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 0.81 percent at 2:05 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They earlier declined
to 0.75 percent, matching yesterday’s low level, the least since
March 28.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes rose five basis points to
3.47 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
