traded mortgage company, jumped to its highest level in a week,
rising 25 cents, or 1 percent, to 26 shillings after Business
Daily reported a new law will allow the lender to offer its
customers current accounts.  Housing Finance has been dependent on expensive fixed-term
deposits and borrowings from other lenders, the Nairobi-based
newspaper reported yesterday, citing Managing Director Frank Ireri. Current accounts will cut the cost of collecting deposits
and enable the company to lend at lower rates.  Nigerian Bottling Company Plc (NBC NL), a unit of Coca-Cola
Hellenic Bottling Company SA, rallied to the highest since March
1, advancing 1.73 naira, or 4.6 percent, to 39 naira. The
company plans to spend 45 billion naira ($292.1 million) on
expanding its capacity in the country, the  Guardian newspaper 
reported, citing Managing Director Jim Lafferty.  The spending is part of a plan by Coca-Cola Hellenic
Bottling to upgrade 10 of its 13 plants in  Nigeria , the Lagos-
based newspaper said.  Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM)  , East Africa’s biggest mobile-
phone company, gained for a third day, increasing 10 cents, or
2.5 percent, to 4.1 shillings after Chief Executive Officer Bob Collymore said fewer than 100 customers planned to move to
another service provider or join Safaricom after Kenya
introduced number portability on April 1, which allows mobile
phone users to retain their number while switching service
providers.  Transnational Corp. of Nigeria Plc (TRANSCOR NL), which has
interests in hotels, agriculture and oil, rallied to a 28-month
high, jumping 6 kobo, or 5 percent, to 1.27 naira after Heirs
Holdings Ltd., a Nigerian  investment company , said it bought a
stake in the company, without disclosing its stake or how much
it paid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
