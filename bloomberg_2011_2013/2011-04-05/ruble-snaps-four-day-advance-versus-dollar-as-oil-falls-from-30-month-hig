The ruble declined against the
dollar for the first day in four as oil,  Russia ’s chief export
earner, fell in  New York  on speculation U.S. reserves of the
commodity climbed to a four-month high last week.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 28.3451 per
dollar at the 5 p.m. close in Moscow, the first drop since March
30. The ruble was 0.2 percent stronger at 40.1900 per euro,
leaving it little changed at 33.6753 versus the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket.  Crude for May delivery slipped as much as 97 cents to
$107.50 per barrel in New York, after rising to a 30-month high
yesterday. A report tomorrow may show stockpiles of the
commodity in the U.S. increased to the highest level in four
months last week as rising prices suppress fuel demand there,
according to analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
