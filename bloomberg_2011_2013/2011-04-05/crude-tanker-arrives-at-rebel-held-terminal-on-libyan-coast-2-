A crude tanker able to load 1
million barrels reached a port in Libya that’s controlled by
rebels seeking to oust leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  The Equator arrived at the Marsa al Hariga terminal, near
the port of Tobruk in eastern Libya, at about 2 p.m. time local
time, according to AISLive Ltd. ship-tracking data compiled by
Bloomberg. The 900-foot vessel came from the  Red Sea  and used
Egypt’s Suez Canal to enter the Mediterranean, the data show.  Brent crude oil fell for the first time in four days in
London trading, partly on speculation that disruptions to Libyan
oil supplies will ease. Libyan crude output plunged 72 percent
to 390,000 barrels a day in March, according to a Bloomberg
survey. That’s the lowest amount in yearly data since 1962.  An interim national council, representing groups opposing
Qaddafi, said April 1 that Qatar agreed to market their oil and
create a deposit account where fees from selling the cargoes
could be sent. Oil-tanker charters for loadings in Libya halted
last month as the uprising intensified,  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the
world’s largest shipbroker, said March 8.  The Equator is operated by Dynacom Tankers Management Ltd.,
Greece’s third-largest operator of supertankers. Ody Valatsas,
chartering manager at Dynacom in  Athens , declined to comment
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
