United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) 
asked U.S. regulators for permission to fly to Tokyo’s Haneda
airport if  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  abandons service there after the
March 11 earthquake.  Delta plans a June resumption of flights from Detroit and
 Los Angeles  to Haneda, where it suspended service in late March,
Trebor Banstetter, a spokesman, said today. The flights have
been loaded in its schedule for at least a week, he said.  “This has always been a temporary suspension of service,”
Banstetter said in a telephone interview.  United Continental broached the idea of serving Haneda in a
March 29 regulatory filing. The Chicago-based carrier said it
could add daily service from Guam, New Jersey’s Newark airport
or San Francisco “in the event that Delta (or any other Haneda-
authorized U.S. carrier) decides to abandon service.”  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s American Airlines also suspended its Haneda
flight for most of April, and said last week that service would
resume on April 26. Failure to restart a flight within 90 days
is considered abandonment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
