South African business confidence in
March rose to the highest level since September 2008, signaling
“more sustainable economic improvement,” the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry said.  The Business Confidence Index advanced to 88.3 last month
from 86.4 in February, the Johannesburg-based chamber said today
in an e-mailed statement. The index is compiled from 13 economic
indicators including retail sales, inflation and financial
gauges, such as the  stock index  and the currency.  “The financial environment remained conducive to a
positive business climate in the short term,” it said.
“Threats to the positive outlook in the financial environment
include new risks in the global economic environment, commodity
price movements and geo-political instability.”  South Africa  needs to become more internationally
competitive to maintain business confidence, the chamber said.
Its economy, the continent’s largest, appears to be weathering
the global shock caused by the nuclear crisis in  Japan , and
business confidence has built up momentum, it said.  Local government elections on May 18, the government’s
response to corruption and the number of labor disputes will be
“key determinants” in deciding whether the index “breaches
the significant level of 90,” the chamber said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
