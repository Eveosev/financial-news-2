The shekel held at the highest
levels in more than two years on bets foreign-currency purchases
by the Bank of  Israel  may not offset the effects of a faster
pace of rate increases.  Government bonds  rose.  The central bank, which has more than doubled reserves to
$73.8 billion since March 2008, has been buying dollars the last
few days, according to Doron Levi, head of the dealing room at
Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd. The shekel increased as much as 0.4
percent to 3.4527 per dollar and was 0.1 percent lower at 3.4695
as of 4:32 in Tel Aviv. It reached 3.4406 per dollar April 1,
the strongest level since September 2008.  “Investors are feeling more comfortable to return to the
shekel as recent dollar purchases and other tools by the central
bank to weaken the currency are not having much of an effect,”
Amir Kahanovich, an economist at Clal Finance Investment
Management Ltd. in  Tel Aviv  said by telephone. “The shekel is
expected to strengthen further supported by sound economic data
and bets the central bank will raise the base lending rate
faster.”  Bank of Israel  Governor  Stanley Fischer  on March 28 lifted
the interest rate by a half-percentage point to 3 percent, the
first increase of its size since 2005, putting the main rate at
the highest level since November 2008. Public sector debt-to-
gross domestic product ratio declined about three percentage
points to 76.6 percent at the end of last year as the economy
expanded, the  Finance Ministry ’s debt management unit said in
its annual report yesterday.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020
advanced, pushing the yield down 2 basis points to 5.25 percent
at the 4:30 p.m. close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
