Transnational Corp. of  Nigeria  Plc,
which has interests in hotels, agriculture and oil, rallied to a
28-month high after  Heirs Holdings Ltd. , a Nigerian  investment
company , said it bought a stake in the company.  The stock climbed 6 kobo, or 5 percent, to 1.27 naira by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. Transnational has more than
doubled this year, compared with a decline of 0.1 percent in the
bourse’s All-Share Index over the same period. It’s the 22nd day
of advances, the longest streak of increases on record.  “Transcorp shareholders will benefit from the Heirs
Holdings track record of value-creation, particularly smaller
shareholders who subscribed to the original vision of the
company as a means of mass participation in Nigeria’s economic
success,” Heirs said in an e-mailed statement from Lagos today,
without disclosing its stake or how much it paid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
