What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  as dry weather threatens crops in
the U.S. and European Union, said Greg Grow, the director of
agribusiness at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago as demand may ebb following the 15 percent
surge in prices in the past three sessions, Grow said. Investors
may halt purchases until the U.S. government updates its
inventory forecast on April 8, he said.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
on the CBOT after  China , the worldâ€™s biggest buyer, raised
 interest rates  for the fourth time since October to restrain
inflation, Grow said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
0.25 cent to 0.35 cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal futures
may open $2 to $3 lower for 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
