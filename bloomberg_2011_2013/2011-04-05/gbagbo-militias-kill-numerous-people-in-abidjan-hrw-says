Militias loyal to  Ivory Coast ’s
former leader,  Laurent Gbagbo , have killed “numerous” people
in the neighborhood of Treichville in the commercial capital,
Abidjan, near the headquarters of the Republican Guard, Human
Rights Watch said.  “Militias based in their headquarters have been going out
and making incursions into the neighborhood and killed numerous
people, including women who have ventured out to get food and
water,” said Corinne Dufka, a Dakar-based researcher for the
group, in a phone interview. “Witnesses tell us bodies are
still lying in the streets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
