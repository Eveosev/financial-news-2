British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  is
establishing a subsidiary company, Nicoventures, which will
develop non-tobacco nicotine products to help smokers quit
cigarettes, the Financial Times reported, citing a statement
from BAT to be released today.  The products, which will have to be licensed by the U.K.
Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, will offer smokers
the “experience” they expect from a cigarette, “without the
real and serious health risks of smoking,” the FT said, citing
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
