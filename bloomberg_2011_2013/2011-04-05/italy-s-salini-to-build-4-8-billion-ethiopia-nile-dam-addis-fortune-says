Salini Costruttori Spa, a Rome-based
construction company, has been chosen by Ethiopian Electric
Power Corp. to build the country’s Great Millennium Dam for
almost $5 billion, the Addis Fortune  reported .  The structure will be built along the Nile River about 40
kilometers (25 miles) from the Sudanese border, the newspaper
said. It will generate 5,250 megawatts of electricity, of which
the first 700 megawatts will come online in 2015, according to
the report published April 3.  The Ethiopian government plans to fund the entire project,
citing difficulties sourcing money from multilateral banks for
its dam projects in the past, the Ethiopian daily reported.  The dam is projected to cost about 80 billion birr ($4.76
billion), or 95 percent of the government’s budget for this
fiscal year, the newspaper said.  Ethiopia has not yet responded to a request from  Egypt  for
the technical and environmental studies of the dam and its
effect on Egypt’s Nile water quota, Addis Fortune said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
