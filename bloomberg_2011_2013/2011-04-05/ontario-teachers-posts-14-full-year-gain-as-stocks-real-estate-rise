Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan ,
Canada’s third-biggest retirement-fund manager, posted a 14
percent return on investments in 2010, led by gains in real
estate and Canadian stocks.  Net investment income rose to C$13.3 billion ($13.8
billion) last year from C$10.9 billion in 2009, the Toronto-
based pension said in a statement today. The fund managed
C$107.5 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, compared with C$96.4
billion a year earlier.  “From an investment perspective, we’ve had a fantastic
year,” Chief Executive Officer Jim Leech told reporters today
in Toronto. “It’s the best year we’ve ever had in the history
of the fund.”  Ontario Teachers’ results are in line with those of Caisse
de Depot et Placement du  Quebec , Canada’s biggest pension-fund
manager, which posted an annual return on investments of 14
percent on Feb 24. The pensions are benefiting from a 12 percent
return in global stocks last year.  The returns weren’t enough to narrow Ontario Teachers’
estimated funding shortfall, which widened to C$17.2 billion,
from C$17.1 billion a year earlier. The shortfall’s cause is a
combination of member longevity, retirement periods that exceed
working years, low real  interest rates  and the maturity of the
plan, which now receives C$1.8 billion less in contributions
than it pays out each year, according to Leech.  “The plan continues to face serious funding challenges,”
Leech said.  Maple Leaf Sports  To address the shortfall, the plan’s sponsors may decide as
early as this year to raise contribution rates or make changes
to benefits, Leech said. The sponsors, which include Ontario’s
provincial government and the Ontario Teachers’ Federation, by
law must decide on changes by 2012.  Leech said the shortfall has nothing to do with why the
fund is considering selling its 66 percent stake in Maple Leaf
Sports and Entertainment Ltd., the owner of the Toronto Maple
Leafs National Hockey League team and Raptors  National
Basketball Association  club.  “Most of the sportswriters have been saying the reason
Teachers’ is selling is so they can pay their bills,” Leech
told reporters. “They’re absolutely not connected whatsoever.”  Ontario Teachers’ said its stock and private-equity
investments returned 10 percent last year as Canadian equities
surged 15 percent. Fixed income returned 9.9 percent. Real
assets such as infrastructure, real estate and timberlands
posted a 14 percent return. Commodities returned 3.2 percent for
the year.  Equity Holdings  Ontario Teachers’ equities portfolio holdings rose to
C$47.5 billion at the end of 2010 from C$41.2 billion, the fund
said. Fixed-income assets climbed to C$45.9 billion from C$35.3
billion a year earlier.  The fund’s allocation to commodities increased to 5 percent
in 2010 from 2 percent in 2009, and was valued at C$5.2 billion
at year-end, up from C$1.9 billion.  The real assets portfolio had C$16.9 billion at the end of
2010, up from C$14.2 billion in 2009.  Ontario Teachers’ is responsible for investing and managing
pensions for about 295,000 active and retired teachers in
 Canada ’s most populous province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
