President  Barack Obama  told Congress
that his plan to begin withdrawing U.S. forces from  Afghanistan 
in July remains on track while warning that “the challenge
remains to make our gains durable and sustainable.”  In a report to Congress that measures U.S. progress in
Afghanistan and Pakistan, the White House claimed modest gains
on the benchmarks that it established for semi-annual review
when Obama announced his decision to increase U.S. ground forces
in Afghanistan in December 2009.  It said that the U.S. has achieved “significant progress
in disrupting and dismantling the Pakistan-based” leadership of
al-Qaeda. Still, advances against al-Qaeda “have diminished,
but not halted” the group’s ability to mount operations.  The report, an unclassified version of which was released
by the administration, echoes testimony from U.S. military
officials to Congress. Last month, U.S. Army General David Petraeus, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, called
the allied gains in Afghanistan are “fragile and reversible”
at an Senate Armed Services Committee.  The report also noted that progress in the U.S.- Pakistan 
relationship has been “substantial” while acknowledging that
it has been “uneven.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
