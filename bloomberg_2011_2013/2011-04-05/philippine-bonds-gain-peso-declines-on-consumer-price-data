Philippine three-year bonds advanced
and the peso declined as consumer prices rose less than analysts
estimated in March, reducing the need for another increase in
the nation’s borrowing costs.  The yield fell to its lowest level in more than two months
as the inflation reading of 4.3 percent matched the gain in
February, the  National Statistics Office  said today. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 16 economists was for an
increase of 4.6 percent. “This tells us that price movements
continue to be well-behaved,” central bank Governor Amando
Tetangco said in a mobile-phone message.  “The need to raise rates by a significant amount may not
be there,” said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president and
treasurer at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “The feeling that
there won’t be much pressure for higher  interest rates  will be
negative for the peso.”  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 dropped
9.5 basis points, or 0.095 percentage point, to 4.95 percent as
of 4:29 p.m. in  Manila , the lowest level since Jan. 28,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  Bonds extended gains as the government reported today a
smaller-than-targeted  budget deficit  for the first two months of
the year. The shortfall was 8.1 billion pesos ($187 million),
compared with a ceiling of 52.3 billion pesos.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 43.36 per dollar at the
close, according to prices from inter-dealer broker Tullett
Prebon Plc. The peso has advanced 1 percent this year.  Policy makers raised the rate paid to lenders for overnight
deposits by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent on March 24, the
first increase since August 2008.  To contact the reporter for this story:
