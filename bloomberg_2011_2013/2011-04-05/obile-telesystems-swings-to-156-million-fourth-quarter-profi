OAO Mobile TeleSystems,  Russia ’s
largest mobile phone company, swung to profit in the fourth
quarter as the domestic economy rebounded from the steepest
decline on record, boosting demand for services.  MTS, as the company is also known, had net income of $156
million in the period, versus a loss of $22.8 million in the
last three months of 2009. Revenue advanced to $3 billion from
$2.72 billion, MTS said in a statement today.  Moscow-based MTS said revenue will probably advance 10
percent last year from 2009, when Russia’s economy contracted
7.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
