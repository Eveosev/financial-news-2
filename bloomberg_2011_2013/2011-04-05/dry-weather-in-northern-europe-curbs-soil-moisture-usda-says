Dry, warm weather in northern  Europe 
curbed soil moisture, while French and Spanish rains are
“favorable” to crops, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
World Agriculture Outlook Board said.  Dryness in Germany and Poland is reducing moisture for
crops emerging from winter dormancy, it said in a report today.
Showers in western Europe are boosting winter wheat, the board
said. Some crops in Russia and Ukraine are breaking from
dormancy, while deep snow still covers wheat in the Volga
District, where drought hurt crops in 2010, it said.  Scattered showers in southern Queensland and northern New
South Wales in  Australia  caused “temporary” interruptions in
early cotton and sorghum harvesting, and rains are hampering
collection in central Queensland, according to the report.  In  Argentina , corn and soybean harvesting is accelerating
on mild weather, the board said. Heavy rain in Brazil is slowing
the harvest while boosting prospects for corn, the report
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
