Coffee exports from  Uganda , Africa’s
second-biggest producer of the beans, climbed 1.6 percent in
March, according to the  Uganda Coffee Development Authority .  Shipments rose to 223,099 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags from
219,684 bags a year earlier, the agency said in an e-mailed
report today. Exports were 15 percent higher than in February
and beat the board’s forecast of 180,000 bags, it said.  Coffee shipments in the 12 months through September are
expected to climb 16 percent to 3.1 million bags, the authority
said on Sept. 20. Uganda plans to increase output to 4.5 million
a season by 2015 through a replanting program. Production has
fallen from 4.4 million bags in 1996-97 because of coffee wilt
disease, the authority said.  East  Africa ’s third-largest economy experienced a dry spell
since December which has curbed coffee production. More than 95
percent of Uganda’s crop is grown by small-scale farmers whose
crop is predominantly rain-fed, according to the agency.  Robusta accounts for about 85 percent of Uganda’s annual
production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
