Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is getting punished again
for its flirtation with bankruptcy in the 1990s.  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)   reduced  the iPad and iPhone maker’s
share of the Nasdaq-100 Index’s value to about 12.33 percent
from 20.49 percent. It will remain the biggest stock in the
gauge, which serves as the basis for the third most-traded U.S.
exchange-traded fund in 2011.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ,  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ,
 Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  had their weighting in the
100-company index increased the most.  The exchange operator revamped the index in December 1998,
reducing how much of the measure’s value its biggest companies
represented, to meet U.S. Internal Revenue Service rules and
permit the creation of the ETF, now known as the  PowerShares QQQ (QQQQ) 
Trust. At the time, Apple shares weren’t valuable enough to have
the curb applied following the Cupertino, California-based
company’s $1.86 billion in combined net losses in 1996 and 1997.  “Apple’s grown a ton since 1998 and its weighting’s been
allowed to become too large a portion of the index,” said
Thomas Garcia, head of equity trading at  Santa Fe , New Mexico-
based Thornburg Investment Management Inc., which oversees about
$80 billion. “To have a company be 20 percent of your index
isn’t an accurate reflection of what’s actually happening in
that market. Nasdaq wants its index to be diversified.”  Microsoft, Cisco  Following the 1998 change, market value wasn’t the only
consideration when assigning weights to companies in the Nasdaq-
100, which today gets 60 percent of its value from technology
companies. The shift more than a decade ago added an adjustment
factor to drive down the representation of stocks such as
Microsoft, Cisco, Intel and  Dell Inc. (DELL)   Apple’s weighting has been allowed to increase without
restraint because Nasdaq OMX didn’t apply a curb 12 years ago.
The change took effect on Dec. 21, 1998, when Apple shares were
valued at $4.76 billion. Microsoft, Cisco, Intel and Dell were
worth $342.4 billion, $141.9 billion, $195.2 billion and $86.9
billion, respectively.  Since then Apple shares surged 3,779 percent through
yesterday, making them the third most-valuable shares in the
world at $314.3 billion. Over the same period, shares of
Microsoft, Cisco, Intel and Dell declined 26 percent, 25
percent, 35 percent and 58 percent, respectively.  More Than Double  Nasdaq OMX said today that Microsoft and Oracle’s
allotments in the index will more than double when the change
takes effect after exchanges close on April 29 -- to 8.32
percent from 3.41 percent and to 6.68 percent from 3.32 percent.
Intel will climb to 4.2 percent from 1.75 percent and Cisco will
rise to 3.66 percent from 1.56 percent. In total, 82 of the 100
index securities will drop in weight,  Nasdaq  said.  “The overall basket is less impacted by the goings-on at
Apple, so the basket post-April 29 will outperform an Apple
selloff much better than before,” said  Dave Lutz , head of
exchange-traded fund trading and strategy at Stifel Nicolaus &
Co. in Baltimore. “In the long run it will create a more
diversified, stable representation.”  Nasdaq OMX announced the changes to the Nasdaq-100 on the
same day that a technical issue disrupted the company’s
distribution of real-time index data at about 11 a.m. New York
time, according to Wayne Lee, a spokesman for the company. The
problem was resolved by 11:30 a.m., the company’s  website  said.  Apple’s Transformation  Apple’s weighting in the gauge is currently more than six
times that of the second-biggest constituent, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, while its market value is only 46
percent larger, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Apple has reshaped itself since the company purchased NeXT
Software Inc. in 1997.  Steve Jobs  formed NeXT in 1985 after he
was fired by Apple. He rejoined the company after the deal and
became chief executive officer -- first on an interim basis and
later permanently -- in September 1997.  Jobs transformed the company, developing Mac OS X as a
replacement for the original Macintosh operating system and
creating the iPod, iPhone and iPad. The company was profitable
every year since, except 2001, growing net income to $14 billion
in 2010 from $309 million in 1998.  Apple shares fell 0.7 percent to $338.89 at 4 p.m. in  New
York . The PowerShares QQQ Trust lost 0.3 percent to $57.12.  “You won’t choose not to buy Apple if you like it because
it’s being reweighted,” said Mike Shea, a managing partner and
trader at Direct Access Partners LLC in New York. “If you’re an
investor, it doesn’t really change the process.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
