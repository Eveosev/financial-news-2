Unions at  Serbia ’s national phone
company Telekom Srbija AD threatened to sue the government if it
negotiates the sale of the company to  Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , Tanjug
newswire reported, citing a union leader.  Telekom Austria’s sole bid for 51 percent of the Serbian
landline and mobile phone operator fell short of a 1.4 billion
euro ($1.99 billion) minimum price and if the government, which
has urged TA to improve its offer, starts negotiating the price,
it would violate regulations and the unions will take the case
to court, Tanjug quoted Miroslav Joksimovic as saying.  Talks with Telekom Austria would discriminate against other
companies, including  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  France Telecom SA (FTE) ,
America Movil SAB,  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)  and Turkcell
Iletisim Hizmetleri AS. who had qualified for the tender,
without making an offer believing that 1.4 billions was the
lowest acceptable price, the union leader was cited as saying in
the report.  The unions remain opposed to selling Telekom to any buyer
under current conditions and think the company can achieve a
higher price after markets improve, Joksimovic was quoted as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
