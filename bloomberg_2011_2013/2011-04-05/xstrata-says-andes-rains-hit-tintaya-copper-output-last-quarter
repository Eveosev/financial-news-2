Xstrata Plc (XTA)  said heavy rainfall in
the Andes Mountains that affected production at its Collahuasi
copper mine in Chile last quarter also disrupted output at its
Tintaya mine in neighboring  Peru .  The mine’s managers are studying “a means of recovering
that production,” Charlie Sartain, who heads Xstrata’s copper
business, said in an interview in Santiago yesterday. The
company can still meet its annual production target, he said.  Higher-than-average rainfall in January and February in the
highlands of the Andes Mountains that runs through Peru and
Chile affected output at Collahuasi, the world’s third-largest
copper mine, and Teck Resources Inc.’s Quebrada Blanca mine.
This year’s copper market will be affected by restricted
supplies, Sartain said.  There are “consistently shortfalls” in the copper
industry, mainly because of falling ore quality in aging mines
in countries such as  Chile , Sartain said. “What you see this
year is an ongoing continuation of that.”  The Zug, Switzerland-based company plans to increase
production to 1.5 million metric tons of copper by the end of
2014. This year the company probably will produce a little more
than last year’s 913,500 tons, Sartain said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
