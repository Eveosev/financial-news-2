Cocoa fell amid signs the conflict
in  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest producer, is ending, freeing
supplies. Sugar also declined.  Forces loyal to Ivory Coast’s Laurent Gbagbo surrendered
and the former president began to negotiate his exit from power
with the United Nations. Cocoa supplies were disrupted after
 Alassane Ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of a
disputed November election, ordered an export ban in January.
Prices have slumped 21 percent since touching a 32-year high of
$3,775 a metric ton on March 4.  “The end is finally in sight,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior
analyst at Vision Financial Markets in Chicago. “Prices may
weaken further.”  Cocoa for May delivery retreated $45, or 1.5 percent, to
settle at $2,975 on ICE Futures U.S. at 12 p.m. in  New York , the
first fall in three sessions.  A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, the largest container-shipping
line, would be able to send vessels to Ivory Coast immediately
if the European Union lifts sanctions announced in January, said
Sonny Dahl, the company’s director of West Africa services.  “Few speculators want to be long with the potential for
exports to resume quickly,” Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank
International in London, said by e-mail today.  On NYSE Liffe in London, cocoa declined 44 pounds, or 2.3
percent, to 1,911 pounds ($3,111).  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery fell 0.31 cent, or 1.2
percent, to 25.26 cents a pound in New York. In London, refined-
sugar futures gained $6.10, or 0.9 percent, to $722.30 a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
