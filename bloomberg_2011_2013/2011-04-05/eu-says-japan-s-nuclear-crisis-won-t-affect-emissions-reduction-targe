The European Union has no plans to
revise its emissions-reduction target because of  Japan ’s nuclear
crisis, said Artur Runge-Metzger, director for climate strategy
and negotiations at the European Commission.  The situation in Japan “will not affect the targets and
the pledges because the targets and the pledges are commensurate
with what science tells us needs to be done in terms of
emissions reductions,” Runge-Metzger said in an interview in
Bangkok. “The question on nuclear is a question of what types
of options do you have to reduce your emissions. As you know,
nuclear is not the only option.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
