Asia gasoil and  fuel oil  swaps
extended gains to reach the highest in more than 31 months.
Naphtha’s crack spread widened for the first time in four days.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, swaps for May rose $1.05, or 0.8
percent, to $136.25 a barrel at 11:35 a.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. That’s the highest
since Aug. 22, 2008. The product’s premium to Asian benchmark
Dubai crude was down 54 cents at $22.64. This crack spread is a
measure of refining profit.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rebounded 15 cents to 65 cents
a barrel, PVM said. The regrade previously narrowed for six
days, the longest losing streak since March 2009, indicating
it’s less profitable to produce  aviation fuel  compared with
diesel.  Fuel Oil  May high-sulfur fuel-oil swaps climbed $9, or 1.3 percent,
to $680 a metric ton, the highest since Aug. 29, 2008, according
to PVM. The discount to Dubai crude widened 21 cents to $9 a
barrel. Refiners typically accept a loss turning oil into
residues because of profit from other products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after declining yesterday to $13.25 a ton,
PVM said. A narrow viscosity spread indicates bunker, or marine
fuel, is gaining more than higher-quality fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Japan ’s open-specification naphtha forward contracts for
first-half May delivery were bid at $1,026.50 a ton against
offers at $1,029.50, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte,
a broker. That’s up from yesterday’s close of $1,013, the
highest in four weeks.  Naphtha’s crack spread to London-traded Brent crude futures
gained for the first time in four days to $102.14 a ton, based
on data compiled by Bloomberg. A widening difference means
increased profit from making the petrochemical feedstock.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha was unchanged yesterday at
$13.60 a barrel, the highest since Feb. 24, Bloomberg
calculations showed. A wider reforming margin shows motor fuel
is profitable compared with naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
