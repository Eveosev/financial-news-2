The U.S.  Air Force  has spent about
$75 million on the allied military operation against Libya, at a
rate of about $4 million a day, Air Force Secretary Michael Donley told reporters in Washington.  The Pentagon has estimated that total U.S. military costs,
as the U.S. scales back its role in fighter strikes, will be
about $40 million per month.  Donley said that the Air Force had about 39 support
aircraft assigned to the Libya operation. Support missions would
include air refueling, transport and intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance. Donley said the U.S., when it initially had
a leading role over Libya, brought about 50 strike aircraft or
fighter jets to the mission.  The US Air Force has flown  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s F-15E,  Lockheed
Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-16 and  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) ’s B-2 stealth
bomber, as well as aircraft used for close-air support, such as
Lockheed’s and Boeing’s AC-130U.  Donley didn’t give a breakdown of how many fighter jets
were used. Donley said some of the strike aircraft may have to
be ready in case NATO needs them for the continuing mission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
