South Korea ’s won snapped a five-day
rally on concern the central bank will intervene to slow the
currency’s advance after its longest winning streak in more than
two months.  Dollar demand from foreign investors converting dividends
received from Korean companies is also likely to weigh on the
currency, said Ko Kyu Youn, currency dealer at Korea Exchange
Bank in Seoul. The relative strength index for the dollar
against the won was at 27 yesterday, below the 30 level that
technical analysts say indicates the U.S. currency’s decline is
overdone.  “Traders are being cautious on concerns that the
authorities may step in to curb the won from rising,” Ko said.
“Foreign stock investors may buy dollars to repatriate their
dividend earnings, while  oil prices  are rising and global stocks
are mixed.”  The won dropped 0.3 percent to 1,090.15 per dollar as of
the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The government’s benchmark three-year bonds fell, with the
yield on the 3 percent note due December 2013 rising one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.70 percent, according to
prices from the Korea Stock Exchange.  The won’s gain accelerated after the currency advanced
beyond the resistance level of 1,100 on March 31, Tsutomu Soma,
a bond and currency trader at Okasan Securities Co. in  Tokyo 
said last week. Overseas investors increased their holdings of
Korean shares for a 14th day, the longest streak of net
purchases this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
