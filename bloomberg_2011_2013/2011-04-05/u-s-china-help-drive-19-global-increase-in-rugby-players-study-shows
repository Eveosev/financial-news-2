Emerging markets including the U.S.,
China and  Japan  helped drive a 19 percent increase in the number
of people playing rugby globally since the 2007  World Cup ,
according to a study commissioned by MasterCard Inc.  More than 5 million players are now registered in 117
countries as emerging nations catch up with traditional playing
territories including Europe and Oceania in terms of
participation, the report by the Coventry, England-based Center
for the International Business of Sport said today.  With participation growth “paramount” to the diffusion
and popularity of the sport, the rise can be attributed to
factors including the addition of Rugby Sevens to the Olympic
Games program from 2016 and a 153 million-pound ($247 million)
funding investment the International Rugby Board made from 2009
to 2012, the report said.  “The future strength and development of the sport is
dependent on achieving a higher level of competitive balance
between the developed and emerging rugby nations,” Simon Chadwick, director of the Center for the International Business
of Sport, said in a statement. “If countries are to improve
their playing quality, they need to increase participation.”  In 2008, the top 10 nations in terms of participation were
the Six Nations and Tri-Nations countries and  Argentina ,
according to the report. The U.S., Japan and  Sri Lanka  all broke
into the top 10 last year.  Japan was the top Asian market with 122,598 registered
players in 2010 ahead of Sri Lanka with 103,325, the report
said. The U.S. had 81,678 players -- a 350 percent participation
increase since 2004 -- on a list headed by  England ’s 2.5
million.  “Bringing rugby to areas not traditionally involved will
engage athletes who might otherwise be attracted to other
sports, or to those who otherwise may have not engaged with
physical activity at all,” the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
