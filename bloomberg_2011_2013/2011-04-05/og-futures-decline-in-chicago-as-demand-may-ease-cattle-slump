Hog futures fell the most in almost
two weeks on speculation that pork demand may ease in  China ,
where the government raised borrowing costs. Cattle also
declined.  China, the world’s biggest consumer of everything from
aluminum to soybeans, raised  interest rates  for the fourth time
since mid-October to restrain inflation. On April 1, hog prices
reached $1.0435 a pound in Chicago, the highest since at least
April 1986. Futures were “overbought,” said Lawrence Kane, a
market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group, a commodity marketer.  “China raising those rates is saying to the world that
they’re trying to control their economy, and it could mean less
imports,” Kane said by telephone from  Yates City ,  Illinois .
“That’s casting a little bit of a caution flag for the people
who are excited about big exports in the future.”  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.6 cent, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $1.0325 at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange, the biggest decline for a most-active
contract since March 23. The commodity is up 21 percent in the
past 12 months.  Cattle futures for June delivery dropped 0.9 cent, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $1.20 a pound on the CME, after yesterday
reaching a record of $1.21625. The price has gained 27 percent
in the past year.  At midday, wholesale choice-beef prices rose 0.4 percent to
$1.9248 a pound, the highest since at least January 2004,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.05 cent
to $1.4135 a pound in Chicago. Yesterday, the price advanced to
$1.42, matching the record high on April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
