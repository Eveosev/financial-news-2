Ukraine must reseed between 10
percent and 12 percent of its winter rapeseed crop, according to
the Agriculture Ministry.  The crop-loss estimate “increases each day,” Oleksandr
Demydov, head of the ministry’s agriculture-markets department,
told reporters in Kiev today. The final area requiring reseeding
may be larger than projected now, he said.  Freezing temperatures damaged winter rapeseed plants on
snow-free areas after late February, Kiev-based researcher
UkrAgroConsult said today by e-mail. Even well-developed crops
suffered damage at rates of 30 percent to 50 percent in fields
without snow cover, the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
