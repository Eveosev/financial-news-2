Ryan Callahan, the  New York Rangers ’
second leading scorer, is out indefinitely after breaking his
right ankle in the team’s 5-3 win over the  Boston Bruins  last
night.  Callahan was injured in the third period, Rangers President
and General Manager Glen Sather said in an e-mailed statement.
The 26-year-old forward has career highs in goals (23) and
assists (25) this season. His 48 points rank second on the team,
behind Brandon Dubinsky.  New York rallied from a 3-0 second-period deficit to beat
the Bruins. The Rangers (43-32-5) are in seventh place in the
 National Hockey League ’s Eastern Conference and can clinch a
playoff spot by winning their final two games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
