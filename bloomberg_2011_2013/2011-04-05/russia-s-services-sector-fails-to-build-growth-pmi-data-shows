Russia’s services sector indicated a
continued failure to build growth momentum in 2011 despite
strong growth in manufacturing production, HSBC Holdings Plc
said.  The seasonally adjusted Business Activity Index fell to
53.3 in March from 53.4 in February, HSBC said in a report
today, citing data compiled by  Markit Economics . The survey-
based index indicates a contraction when it is below 50 and
growth with a figure above 50.  “The good news is that the service sector usually follows
the manufacturing trend with some time lag,”  Alexander Morozov ,
chief economist at HSBC in Moscow, said in the statement. “If
such a relationship holds, one would expect the service sector
to improve its performance in the coming months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
