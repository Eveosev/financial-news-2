The Venezuelan government should
reduce borrowing costs by communicating better with the market,
central bank President Nelson Merentes said, according to  El
Nacional .  It makes no sense that  Venezuela  should be considered so
risky when it has always paid its debts, the Caracas-based paper
cited Merentes as saying in an interview. The government will
not devalue the bolivar by adjusting the  exchange rate  on the
central bank-administered bond trading system known as the Sitme
because “all of the exchange rate adjustments that needed to be
done have already been made,” Merentes said, according to El
Nacional.  To contact the reporter on this story:
