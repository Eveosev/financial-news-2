U.S. stocks erased gains, preventing
a third straight advance in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as
growing concern that the  Federal Reserve  will begin removing
stimulus measures offset optimism about takeover deals.  Boeing Co. (BA)  lost 1 percent to help lead the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  down from an almost three-year high amid
concern inspectors will find more problems with the company’s
737 jets.  Google Inc. (GOOG)  sank 3.2 percent as people familiar with
the matter told Bloomberg News that the U.S. government is
considering an antitrust probe.  National Semiconductor Corp. (NSM) ,
which led the earlier gain in the  S&P 500 , surged 71 percent
after  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN)  agreed to buy the chipmaker.  The S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1 percent to 1,332.63 at 4
p.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as 0.4 percent earlier
today. The Dow average retreated 6.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to
12,393.90. The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  advanced 0.5 percent, after
rallying to a record intraday high.  “Investors are fearful that if they don’t get another
round of quantitative easing, the market doesn’t get another
shot in the arm,” said Kevin Caron, a market strategist in
Florham Park, New Jersey, at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which has
about $110 billion in client assets. “I’m not convinced. We
have solid economic figures and corporate earnings. The path of
least resistance for the market would be higher.”  Stimulus Measures  The S&P 500 has risen 6 percent in 2011 as government
stimulus measures, corporate takeovers and higher-than-estimated
profits boosted investors’ optimism.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  starts the
earnings reporting season on April 11. The aluminum producer may
post net income of $321 million in the first quarter, according
to the average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  Stocks began to reverse earlier gains as minutes from the
Fed’s last policy meeting showed central bankers differed over
whether to begin removing record stimulus this year as they
debated the path of monetary policy after the completion of
their $600 billion bond-purchase program.  “A few participants indicated that economic conditions
might warrant a move toward less-accommodative monetary policy
this year; a few others noted that exceptional policy
accommodation could be appropriate beyond 2011,” the Federal
Open Market Committee said in minutes of its March 15 meeting,
released today in  Washington . “Almost all” Fed officials also
saw no need to “taper” Treasury buying, jettisoning their
prior strategy of reducing the pace of purchases while
stretching out their duration.  Federal Budget  U.S. House Republicans today unveiled a plan to overhaul
the federal budget and slash the deficit in coming years by
about three-quarters, with a $6 trillion cut in spending and 25
percent cap on tax rates. The proposal would cut the deficit
next year to $995 billion from $1.4 trillion now. It would
continue to narrow the shortfall to as little as $379 billion in
2018, though it wouldn’t balance the government’s books until
2040.  Boeing fell 1 percent to $73.23. The company said the
metal-fatigue cracks that ripped open a hole last week on a
Southwest Airlines Co. 737 jet occurred earlier than the
planemaker had expected in the life of the aircraft.  Google slipped 3.2 percent to $569.09. The U.S. Federal
Trade Commission is considering a broad antitrust investigation
of the company’s dominance in the Internet-search industry, two
people familiar with the matter said.  KB Home (KBH)  Slumps  KB Home sank 4.2 percent to $11.69. The Los Angeles-based
homebuilder that targets first-time buyers reported a wider
first-quarter loss than analysts estimated as revenue and new
orders plunged amid slumping demand for new houses.  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rallied 2.3 percent as
25 of its 30 stocks advanced. A gauge of chipmakers in the S&P
500 added 1.6 percent, the most within 24 industries.  National Semiconductor rallied 71 percent to $24.06 for its
biggest gain since at least 1980. Texas Instruments, the second-
largest U.S. chipmaker, agreed to buy the Santa Clara,
California-based chipmaker for about $6.5 billion, its biggest
acquisition as it expands its leadership in analog
semiconductors. Texas Instruments will pay $25 a share in the
all-cash transaction, a 78 percent premium to National
Semiconductor’s previous closing price of $14.07.  Texas Instruments rose 1.7 percent to $34.69.  Abercrombie Jumps    Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF)  rallied 11 percent to $65.57. The
teen retailer announced plans to open stores in  China  and said
it expects to earn $4.75 a share in 2012.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  fell 0.7 percent to $338.89. The company’s
representation in the Nasdaq-100 will be cut to 12.33 percent of
the index on May 2, from 20.49 percent, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.
said in a  slide show  on its website, after previous rules caused
its proportion in the gauge to grow disproportionately.  “Apple rebalancing creates another buying opportunity,”
Brian J. White, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities LLC, wrote in
a note today. “As these concerns subside and investors again
focus on the fundamentals surrounding Apple’s business, we
believe the stock will reach new, all-time highs.”  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the largest provider of networking
equipment, gained 0.9 percent to $17.22.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the
world’s largest software maker, rallied 0.9 percent to $25.78.
Both companies’ weightings will more than double.  A gauge of raw-material producers rallied 1.1 percent, the
most in the S&P 500 within 10 industries. Gold futures surged to
a record of $1,458.60 an ounce as concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis will worsen boosted demand for the metal as an
alternative asset. Portuguese bonds sank and the cost of
insuring the nation’s debt rose to a record as Moody’s Investors
Service said a bailout is inevitable.  Gold Producers Rally  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest U.S. gold producer,
advanced 4.4 percent to $56.98.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) , the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer,
rallied 1.5 percent to $56.61.  The S&P 500 has rebounded 6 percent from its low for the
year on March 16. Individual investors may have helped drive the
rally while professional money managers were sellers,  Bespoke
Investment Group LLC  said.  Individual investors enter most transactions at the start
of a trading day, while institutional investors trade at the end
of the day, according to Bespoke, which tracks the intraday
performance of the market on an hourly basis. Since the
benchmark’s 2011 low on March 16, the S&P 500 posted its biggest
gain in the first half hour of trading, averaging 0.37 percent,
while dropping the most during the final hour, losing 0.05
percent, data from the Harrison, New York-based firm showed.  “Nearly all of the market’s gains during the current rally
have come in the first hour and a half of trading,” Justin Walters, Bespoke’s co-founder, wrote in a note to clients
yesterday. “If anything, the ‘smart money’ has been taking
money off the table.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
