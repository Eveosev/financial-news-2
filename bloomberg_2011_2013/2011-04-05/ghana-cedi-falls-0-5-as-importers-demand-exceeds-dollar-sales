Ghana ’s cedi weakened against the
dollar for a second day as importers’ demand for the U.S.
currency exceeded the central bank’s sales.  The currency of the world’s second largest producer of
cocoa depreciated 0.5 percent to 1.5195 per dollar as of 4:13
p.m. in Accra, falling from a close of 1.5125 yesterday,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  “The cedi today shed some of the gains it made last week
on fresh corporate demand from manufacturers and general
importers,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at Barclays Plc’s
 Ghana  unit, said in a telephone interview today. “ Bank of Ghana 
sold between $20 million and $25 million today but this was not
enough to match the high demand.”  The cedi may end the week around 1.5225 per dollar as the
demand pressure continues, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
