Ankara’s chief prosecutor ordered
police to inspect the company that printed  Turkey ’s university
entrance exams, amid allegations the answers were coded to help
favored students,  Milliyet  reported.  The police confiscated exam papers and searched computers
to find out whether the papers sent to the press, in which the
correct answers could be found using a simple formula, were also
sent to students, Milliyet said.  Ali Demir, head of the testing service, has denied that the
questions were coded. His predecessor, Unal Yarimagan, said that
Demir’s explanation was “not satisfactory,” Milliyet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
