Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ,  India ’s biggest
wind-turbine maker, fell in Mumbai a day after announcing plans
to buy the remainder of its German unit  Repower Systems AG. (RPW)   The Indian company, with four straight quarters of losses,
dropped 1.2 percent to close at 49.1 rupees for its first
decline since March 28. Suzlon said it plans to buy out minority
shareholders in Repower Systems and may sell its stake in Hansen
Transmissions International NV to fund the purchase.  The company also priced $150 million of its new 5 percent
convertible bonds due April 2016 at 54.01 rupees a share with
the notes bearing a yield to maturity of 6.50 percent, according
to a statement today on the Bombay Stock Exchange.  Today’s decline brought Suzlon’s share loss this year to 10
percent, and 33 percent over the last 12 months. Repower’s stock
dropped as much as 6.4 percent today in German trading, the most
since Dec. 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
