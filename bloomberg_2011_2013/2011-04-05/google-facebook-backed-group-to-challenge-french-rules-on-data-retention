An industry group backed by  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  and Facebook Inc. plans to challenge French rules over a
decree requiring Internet companies to retain user data for a
year and to make it available to the authorities.  France’s  Association des Services Internet Communautaires 
will submit a complaint tomorrow to the Conseil d’Etat, the
country’s highest court, Secretary General Benoit Tabaka said by
phone today. In addition to Google and Facebook, the
association’s members include  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , AOL Inc.,  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) , and DailyMotion SA., according to its website.  Under a decree published in France’s official legal journal
on March 1, Web companies should conserve for one year “data
permitting the identification of all persons who have
contributed to the creation of content placed online” including
Internet protocol addresses, usernames and passwords.  France  has
some of the world’s toughest rules on Internet use, including
the “Hadopi” law setting out fines for illegal downloading.  “The data that’s especially sensitive for us is the
password,” aid Tabaka, who is also the legal director of French
retail site PriceMinister. “For us this is clearly not
identification data, but personal data.”  ASIC also believes the European Commission wasn’t properly
notified of the decree, he said.  Al Verney, a spokesman for Mountain View, California-based
Google, referred questions to ASIC. Andrew Noyes, a spokesman
for Palo Alto, California-based Facebook, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
