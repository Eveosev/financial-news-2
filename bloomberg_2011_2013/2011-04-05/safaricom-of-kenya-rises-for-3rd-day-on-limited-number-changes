Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , East Africa’s
biggest mobile-phone company, gained for a third day after
saying fewer than 100 customers planned to move to another
service provider after Kenya introduced number portability.  The stock rose 10 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 4.1 shillings
by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital.  “We have received less than 100 port in-or-out requests,
with the majority still within the 48-hour processing period,”
Chief Executive Officer Bob Collymore said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Number portability , introduced on April 1 by the
Communications Commission of Kenya, is a service that allows
 mobile phone users  to retain their number while switching
service providers. The service is meant to increase competition
among  Kenya ’s four mobile-phone companies, head of the
commission, Charles Njoroge said Nov. 8.  “The initial indication is that the impact of number
portability has not been significant,” Eric Musau, an analyst
at Nairobi-based African Alliance Securities Kenya Ltd., said by
phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
