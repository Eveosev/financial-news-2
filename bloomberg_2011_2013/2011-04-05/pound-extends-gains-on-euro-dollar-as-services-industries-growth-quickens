The U.K. pound extended gains
against the dollar and the euro after service-industries growth
accelerated to the fastest pace in more than a year in March.  The pound gained 0.8 percent to 87.42 pence against the
euro at 9:39 a.m. in  London , and was 0.6 percent stronger at
$1.6224.  A gauge based on a survey of companies rose to 57.1 from
52.6 in February, Markit Economics Ltd. and the  Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said in today in London. The
reading was higher than the median forecast of 52.6 from 26
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
