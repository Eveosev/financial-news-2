Amlin Plc (AML) , the biggest Lloyd’s of
London insurer, said losses from the Japanese earthquake last
month may be as much as 150 million pounds ($242 million), less
than analyst estimates.  Claims from  Japan ’s biggest earthquake on record will be
between 80 million pounds and 150 million pounds, based on
overall market losses of $12 billion to $25 billion, the London
based insurer said in a statement today.  “The loss levels are slightly below our estimates,” said
Joy Ferneyhough, a London-based analyst at Banco Espirito Santo
de Investimento SA with a “buy” rating on the stock. “This
appears to confirm our view that none of the quality players
will be disproportionately affected by Japan.”  Earthquakes in  New Zealand  and flooding in  Australia  at the
end of 2010 and the beginning of this year had already dented
insurers’ catastrophe reserves before the 9.0 magnitude quake
struck northeast Japan on March 11. Amlin said the scale of this
year’s losses “mean that increased reinsurance protection will
be available for future events in 2011.”  The insurer said claims from the 2011 Queensland floods
will be about 15 million pounds and costs from the Christchurch
earthquake this year will be about 110 million pounds.  “Overall, these losses are broadly where we might have
expected for Amlin, if not slightly lower,” said Eamonn Flanagan, a Liverpool, England-based analyst at Shore Capital
Group Ltd.  The stock climbed 1.6 pence, or 0.4 percent, to 388.3 pence
as of 9:22 a.m. in  London  trading, for a market value of about
1.9 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
