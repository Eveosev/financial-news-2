Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al- Naimi and U.K. Energy Secretary  Chris Huhne  will say at a
meeting today in  Riyadh  that there is “no global shortage of
oil,” Huhne said in an e-mailed statement.  “There is no shortage of supply, and yet the price has
remained high,” according to the statement. “International
energy markets should understand that the current price of oil
does not reflect the realities of supply and demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
