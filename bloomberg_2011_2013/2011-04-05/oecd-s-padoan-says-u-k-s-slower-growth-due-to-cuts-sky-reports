The OECD’s Pier Carlo Padoan told
Sky News that U.K. economic growth, which will slow to 1 percent
in the second quarter after expanding by 3 percent in the first
quarter, is an “acceptable growth rate given the conditions.”  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
Deputy Secretary General, who cited the group’s interim
forecast, said in an interview that Britain will grow at a
slower rate than other Group of 7 countries “to some extent”
because of the government’s program of fiscal tightening,
“which, however, is needed in our view, given the state of
public finances in the U.K.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
