Digital Plus, the pay-television
unit of  Promotora de Informaciones SA (PRS) , or Prisa, is losing
market share and revenue to competitors including Ono and
Imagenio,  El Confidencial  reported today, citing a document sent
to unions.  Prisa had 1.78 million subscribers in 2010, down from 1.84
million a year earlier and 2.03 million in 2008, the financial
news website said today.  The company, which sold a 22 percent stake in Digital Plus
to  Telefonica SA (TEF)  and a stake of the same size to  Gestevision
Telecinco SA (TL5)  in December for a total of 976 million euros ($1.38
billion), may use the drop in Digital Plus market share and
sales as a justification as it eliminates more than 2,500 jobs,
El Confidencial said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
