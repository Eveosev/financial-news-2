The European Securities and Markets
Authority has begun an investigation into automated trading
firms, asking for details on trading strategies and the computer
algorithms that drive their trading deals, the Financial Times
reported, citing a questionnaire sent to companies across
 Europe .  The probe is part of a fact-finding project to enable ESMA
to “better understand high frequency trading strategies and the
impact of these strategies on the functioning of the markets as
a whole, including the risks associated with HFT,” the
questionnaire said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
