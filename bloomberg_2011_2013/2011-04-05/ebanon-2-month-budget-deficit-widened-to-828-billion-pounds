Lebanon’s budget deficit more than
doubled in the first 2 months of the year as tax-revenue growth
slowed and payment on foreign debt rose.  The deficit widened to 828 billion Lebanese pounds ($552
million) from 292 billion pounds in the same period a year
earlier, the  Ministry of Finance  said in an e-mail today.  The government spent 23 billion pounds more on repayment of
foreign debt. Lebanon, which went through a 15-year civil war
until 1990, amassed debt from the reconstruction of the country
and after a monthlong war with  Israel  in 2006. The debt was
about $52.5 billion at the end of last year.  Tax revenue grew 2 percent in the first two months of this
year as compared with 10 percent in the previous year.  Lebanon’s government spent 8 billion pounds less in the
first two months of the year on subsidies for  Electricite du
Liban , which provides more than 90 percent of the country’s
electricity and has traditionally sapped the budget, the
ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
