Canadian stocks rose for a sixth
day, led by gold producers, as the metal climbed to a record

rating and the U.S. dollar weakened.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-largest producer by
market value, advanced 5.8 percent.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,

Oakville, Ontario, and vice president of the Canadian Society of
Technical Analysts. “The ISM suggests we’re not as strong as
we’d like to be in this recovery. That tilts it toward more
stimulus, and more stimulus means a weakening  U.S. dollar .”  The S&P/TSX gained 27 percent in the nine months ending
yesterday as gold surged 19 percent. Eight of the world’s 19
