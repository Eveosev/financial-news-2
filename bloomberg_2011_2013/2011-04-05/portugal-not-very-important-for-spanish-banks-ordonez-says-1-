Bank of  Spain  Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez said  Portugal  is “not very important” for
Spanish banks as investors increase bets the country will have
to seek a European bailout.  “The issue of Portugal is important for Spain, not so much
for the banks fortunately, unlike other countries which have
Portuguese risk on their balance sheets,” Ordonez told
reporters today in Madrid. “What Spain has are banks there,
which finance themselves internally. So for the banking sector,
it’s not very important.”  Portugal’s government is fighting growing speculation that
it will be forced to seek a European bailout. The country’s
credit rating was cut by Moody’s Investors Service for the
second time in three weeks today, and the ratings company said
it expected the government that emerges from the June 5
elections to trigger the European Union’s rescue facility.  Spain,  Germany ,  France  and the U.K. have the biggest
investments in Portugal, according to the Bank for International
Settlements, and Banco Santander SA, Spain’s biggest lender,
owns Portugal’s fourth-largest bank. Spain has foreign claims
amounting to $85 billion in Portugal, according to data from the
Basel-based BIS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
