UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V) ,  Europe ’s second-
largest papermaker, said it faces a shutdown of Finnish
production in “a couple of days” if salaried employees walk
off their jobs in a two-week strike scheduled to start tomorrow.  “It is impossible to estimate the exact impacts of the
strike, but even a conservative estimate of the damage would be
given in millions of euros,” Jyrki Ovaska, head of the paper
division, said today in a statement. The Helsinki-based
manufacturer had sales of 8.92 billion euros ($12.6 billion)
last year.  The Pro trade union and the Finnish Forest Industries
Federation disagree on pay increases. Pro on March 22 announced
an industrywide overtime ban starting April 1 and a two-week
strike among salaried employees at UPM-Kymmene from April 6.
Targeting UPM is the most effective way to reach quick results
for the industry, Pro Chairman Antti Rinne said today by phone.  UPM may move some production and administrative functions
from  Finland  “if there is repeated uncertainty in our
operations,” Ovaska said. The strike would affect most Finnish
production, he said.  The union is asking for a 3.5 percent salary increase and
wants to move to an “old-fashioned compensation system,” the
company said in the statement. State conciliator Esa Lonka
hasn’t scheduled further talks between the parties, Rinne said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
