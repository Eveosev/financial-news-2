Citigroup Inc. advised buying the
pound against the euro, betting that expectations for the
difference between central bank  interest rates  will narrow and
euro-area credit risk will increase relative to the U.K.  “The latest surge in euro-pound has outpaced the move in
foreign-exchange fundamentals,” New York-basedGreg Anderson
and Valentin Marinov in London wrote in an investor report
today. “The market is getting excessively hawkish on the
 European Central Bank  relative to the Bank of England. Investors
may be getting too complacent about the credit outlook for the
euro area.”  Investors should bet the euro will weaken to 84 pence and
end the trade if it strengthens to 90.62 pence, the analysts
wrote. The euro was little changed at 88.03 pence as of 7:15
a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
