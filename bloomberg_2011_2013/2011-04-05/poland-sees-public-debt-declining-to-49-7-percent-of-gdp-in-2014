The Polish government approved a
medium-term budget plan that forecasts economic growth of 4
percent this year and next and a drop in public debt levels to
below 50 percent of gross domestic product in 2014.  According to the plan, which the government adopted during
its weekly Cabinet meeting today, economic growth will slow to
3.7 percent in 2013 and then accelerate to 3.9 percent in 2014.  Prime Minister  Donald Tusk  is depending on rising GDP and
the zloty’s appreciation to keep public debt from breaching a
legal limit of 55 percent of economic output that would trigger
mandatory austerity measures. The plan sees debt falling from 53
percent of GDP in 2010 to 52.7 percent this year, 51.9 percent
in 2012, 50.6 percent in 2013 and 49.7 percent in 2014.  Poland’s jobless rate will fall to 10 percent by the end of
next year and to 8.5 percent in 2014. Unemployment rose to 13.2
percent in February, the highest rate in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
