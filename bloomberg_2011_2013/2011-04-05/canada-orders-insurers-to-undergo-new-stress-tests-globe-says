Canada’s Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions has ordered life
insurance companies to undergo a new round of so-called stress
tests designed to measure their ability to cope with volatility
on financial markets, the Globe and Mail reported.  The new tests will be more detailed in scope and complexity
than the previous ones and have been met with objections from
the industry, the newspaper said, citing insurance company
executives.  Credit losses and a drop in stock prices have prompted
concern among regulators over capital levels at insurers, the
newspaper said.  Insurers says the new tests are too severe, require too much
informtion, and that they haven’t been given enough time to
prepare them, the Globe reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
