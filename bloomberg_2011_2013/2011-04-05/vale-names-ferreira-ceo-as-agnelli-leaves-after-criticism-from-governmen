Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, said its controlling shareholders named Murilo
Pinto de Oliveira Ferreira as chief executive officer, replacing
Roger Agnelli after the Brazilian government criticized the
company’s strategy for the past two years.  Ferreira, who was president of Vale’s Canadian operations
until 2008, will take over as head of Vale on May 22 after
Angelli’s current mandate expires, the Rio de Janeiro-based
company said in a regulatory filing today. Ferreira’s nomination
by the controlling shareholders of Valepar SA, which controls
53.5 percent of Vale, will be submitted to the company’s board
in a meeting yet to be announced, Vale said.  Vale, which denied as recently as January that its Valepar
controlling shareholders were discussing a replacement for
Agnelli, 51, said March 31 that the group was hiring an
international recruitment consultant to help draw up a list of
three possible candidates to replace Agnelli. The Brazilian
government repeatedly criticized the company for not investing
more in the domestic steel and fertilizer industries.  Vale fired 1,300 employees, said that 5,500 more would be
put on paid leave and pared its investments by about half to $9
billion, from an announced $14.2 billion, during the global
recession two years ago. The decision was criticized by then-
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who said the
company had “no reason” to cut spending because it had “lots
of cash” to help the domestic economy resume growth  To contact the reporter on this story:
