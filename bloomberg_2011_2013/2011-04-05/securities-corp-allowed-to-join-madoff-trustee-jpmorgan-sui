The Securities Investor Protection
Corp., which initiated the liquidation of  Bernard Madoff ’s
money-management firm, can be heard in trustee Irving Picard’s
$6.4 billion suit against JPMorgan Chase & Co., a judge ruled.  JPMorgan, which is contesting Picard’s allegation that it
aided in Madoff’s $20 billion Ponzi scheme, said in a letter to
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon that SIPC’s filing of
arguments in the case wasn’t contemplated by existing agreements
between the parties and was done without informing JPMorgan. The
New York-based bank, which is trying to move the case to U.S.
district court from U.S. bankruptcy court, said it may object to
SIPC’s participation in the case.  A note on the docket yesterday said, “SIPC can be heard.”  The case is Picard v.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , 11-cv-00913,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
