German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will
make an official visit and attend a state dinner at the White
House on June 7, the Obama administration announced today.  This will be the first such visit by a German chancellor
since Chancellor Helmut Kohl was hosted at the White House in
1995, the White House said in a statement.  The visit “underscores the fundamental importance of the
U.S.-German alliance,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
