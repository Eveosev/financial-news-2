Kieran Curtis, who helps manage
about $2 billion in emerging-market debt in  London  at Aviva
Investors, a unit of the U.K.’s second-largest insurer, comments
on the impact of China raising  interest rates  for the fourth
time since the global financial crisis to restrain inflation.  The benchmark one-year lending rate will increase to 6.31
percent from 6.06 percent from tomorrow, the People’s Bank of
China said on its website today. The one-year deposit rate will
rise to 3.25 percent from 3 percent.  On asset bubbles:  “There are plenty of specific measures that suggest they
are worried. Although price and transaction growth has slowed in
the major cities for property markets, it’s clear they have been
trying to reduce the monetary and administrative stimulus for a
while. I don’t think this rate hike is a surprise.  On implications for the global economy:  “The obvious channel is commodity prices.  China ’s growth
is quite raw material intensive. Assuming they are successful in
slowing growth then there should be an impact on demand.  On market impact:  “In itself it’s a pretty minor measure but the basic
implication is probably that Asian currencies are more
attractive. China tends to tighten when the going is good. So,
Chinese tightening is often coincident with strong global stock
markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
