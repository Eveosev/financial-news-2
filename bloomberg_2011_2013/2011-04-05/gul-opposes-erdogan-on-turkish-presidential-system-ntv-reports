Turkish President  Abdullah Gul  said
he was “personally distant” to the idea of switching Turkey
from a parliamentary to a presidential system of government,  NTV 
television reported.  Gul’s remarks indicate a split with Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who favors the switch, NTV said in a report from
Indonesia where Gul is on a visit. Erdogan has said he’s
considering holding a referendum on the issue after general
elections in June.  The president in Turkey already has too much power, NTV
cited Gul as saying. Having a public debate on the issue is
“useful,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
