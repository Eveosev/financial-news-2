Silverstein Properties Inc. plans to
issue $900 million of fixed-rate municipal bonds next week to
refinance debt issued to build a 63-story tower at the  World
Trade Center site , said Elizabeth Mitchell, a spokeswoman for
the Empire State Development Corp.  Silverstein is issuing the bonds through the state’s
Liberty Development Corp., a subsidiary of Empire.  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  will lead a group of investment banks in selling the
bonds, which were issued in 2009 as part of the Liberty Bond
program. The program was part of a U.S. economic package to help
 New York City  recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks by
providing developers access to cheaper tax-exempt financing.  Silverstein has postponed the bond issue for the 1.8
million-square-foot (167,220-square-meter) Tower 4 since
December as concerns about state and local government finances
and a flood of issuance drove 30-year  interest rates  on
municipal bonds to two-year highs. Yields on top-rated 30-year
municipal bonds reached 5.28 percent in the week of Jan. 14,
according to Municipal Market Advisors. They declined to 5.11
percent April 4.  Silverstein also plans to issue as much as $375 million of
floating-rate bonds as part of the deal, according to Bud Perrone, a spokesman for Silverstein. The Securities Industry
and Financial Markets Association seven-day swap index, which is
used to measure top-grade, floating-rate bonds, was 0.25 percent
on March 30.  ‘Net Results’  “We are expecting to achieve the rates that we would have
achieved just before the market turned up, so I think we’ll end
up pleased with the net results,” company President  Larry Silverstein  said in an interview after announcing a new lease
for law firm  WilmerHale  at 7 World Trade Center. He didn’t offer
specifics.  The Tower 4 bonds are backed by payments from the  Port
Authority  of New York and  New Jersey  and fixed rents from a 15-
year lease with New York City. In December, Standard & Poor’s
rated the debt AA-, its fourth-highest investment grade rating.
The new debt for Tower 4 will mature in 2031, 2041 and 2047.  The World Trade Center  redevelopment plan  includes five
office towers, with the 1,776-foot One World Trade Center,
formerly called the Freedom Tower. The project incorporates a
Sept. 11 memorial, a transit center and a museum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
