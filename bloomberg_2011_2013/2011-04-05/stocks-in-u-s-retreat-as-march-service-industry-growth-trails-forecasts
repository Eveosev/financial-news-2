U.S. stocks rose for a third day as
National Semiconductor Corp. led technology shares higher after
getting a takeover bid and Abercrombie & Fitch Co.’s earnings
forecast topped estimates.  National Semiconductor, which makes analog chips, surged 71
percent after Texas Instruments Inc. offered to buy the company
for $6.5 billion. Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen retailer,
rallied 8.5 percent.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.2 percent to 1,335.48 at 10:39 a.m. in
 New York  after slipping 0.2 percent earlier. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  climbed 16.35 points, or 0.1 percent, to
12,416.38. The  Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP)  increased 0.3 percent.  “We’ve got a pretty solid operating environment for
businesses,” said  Jeffrey Kleintop , chief market strategist at
LPL Financial Corp. in Boston, which manages $284 billion.
“We’ll get earnings starting next week which will reflect these
conditions. In addition to that, there are lots of buyout deals
getting done out of cash. Technology takeovers are a sign of
what’s more to come in 2011.”  The S&P 500 has risen 6 percent in 2011 through yesterday
as government stimulus measures, higher-than-estimated earnings
and corporate takeovers boosted investors’ optimism. The index
had fallen as much as 6.4 percent from this year’s high on Feb.
18 as concern grew about Japan’s nuclear crisis and uprisings in
the Middle East and northern  Africa .  Service Industries  Stocks retreated earlier after the Institute for Supply
Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses decreased to
57.3 in March from 59.7 a month earlier. The median forecast of
69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected the measure
would be little changed at 59.5. A reading above 50 signals
growth for about 90 percent of the economy. Estimates ranged
from 57.7 to 61.  China raised interest rates for the fourth time since the
end of the global financial crisis to restrain inflation and
limit the risk of asset bubbles. The benchmark one-year lending
rate will increase to 6.31 percent from 6.06 percent, effective
tomorrow, the People’s Bank of China said on its website at the
end of a national holiday. The one-year deposit rate rises to
3.25 percent from 3 percent.  The  Federal Reserve  will release minutes of its March 15
meeting today at 2 p.m. The dollar rose versus most of its major
counterparts after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said inflation
must be watched “extremely closely,” encouraging bets that
 interest rates  may be raised sooner than previously expected.
Bernanke said yesterday in Stone Mountain, Georgia, that policy
makers would “have to respond” if estimates that faster
inflation will be transitory prove incorrect.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
