Housing Finance Ltd.,  Kenya â€™s only
publicly traded mortgage company, jumped to its highest level in
a week after  Business Daily  reported a new law will allow the
lender to offer its customers current accounts.  The stock climbed for a second day, adding 25 cents, or 1
percent, to 26 shillings at the 3 p.m. close in the capital,
Nairobi, the highest since March 28.  Housing Finance has been dependent on expensive fixed-term
deposits and borrowings from other lenders, the Nairobi-based
newspaper reported yesterday, citing Managing Director Frank Ireri. Current accounts will cut the cost of collecting deposits
and enable the company to lend at lower rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
