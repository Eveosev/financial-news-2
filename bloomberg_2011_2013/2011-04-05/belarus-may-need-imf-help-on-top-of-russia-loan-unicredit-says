Belarus may need a $2.5 billion
International Monetary Fund loan package to help cover its
external financing gap after the country’s foreign reserves
plunged, according to UniCredit SpA.  The eastern European country devalued its currency, the
ruble, on March 29 by 8 percent, according to UniCredit
calculations, as part of a strategy to reduce a current-account
deficit equivalent to 15.6 percent of gross domestic product
last year. It is also seeking a $3 billion bailout loan from
 Russia  and former Soviet partners to plug its financing gap.  “The loss of 20 percent of the central bank’s foreign-
exchange reserves since the start of the year (some $1 billion)
comes amid an uncertain external financing profile,”  Dmitry Gourov , an emerging-market strategist at UniCredit in Vienna,
wrote in the note. In addition to funding from Russia and the
Eurasian Economic Community, “there is a high chance that an
IMF package will be requested in the second half,” he wrote.  Belarus received an IMF bailout loan of $3.5 billion in
2009 to shore up its economy after the global financial crisis
caused investors to flee emerging markets. The program expired
last year. Belarus has not applied for new funding from the IMF,
according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
