Cyprus should re-examine plans to
impose a temporary tax on the country’s lenders to raise funds
in part to boost state coffers, the  European Central Bank  said.  “Using the proceeds of any ad hoc taxes imposed on banks
for general budgetary purposes would be undesirable” if such
duties “place undue burdens on banks, hampering the provision
of credit, with a knock-on effect on growth in the real
economy,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said in a  statement  on its
website.  Such taxes “might result in extra charges for their
customers and may induce certain banks to cut back on their
activities, leading to a reduction in the availability of credit
and creating uncertainty for banks, their customers and the
economy,” the ECB said.  Cyprus plans to raise 60 million euros ($85 million) in
2011 and 2012 each from an extraordinary levy of 0.095 percent
on deposits at local banks, Finance Minister Charilaos Stavrakis
said March 28. Of the total amount raised, 70 million euros will
be allocated to the state and 50 million euros to help start a
financial fund to support banks in an emergency.  While the ECB supports taxes on financial institutions to
create so-called resolution funds to support banks, Cyprus
should ensure that management of any fund is entrusted to
national authorities responsible for resolving ailing financial
entities and for the fund to operate independently of the
government, the ECB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
