India ’s rupee gained, touching the
highest level in almost five months, after overseas investors
boosted holdings of the country’s shares to benefit from the
economic growth outlook for  Asia ’s third-largest economy.  Global funds bought $1.6 billion more Indian stocks than
they sold last month through March 30, exchange data show.
India’s $1.3 trillion economy will expand as much as 9.25
percent this financial year started April 1, the most since the
year through March 2008, the government forecast in February.  “The stock market is looking positive with decent capital
inflows,” said J. Moses Harding, a Mumbai-based executive vice
president at IndusInd Bank Ltd. The rupee may trade between
44.50 and 45 per dollar over the next month, he said.  The rupee strengthened 0.4 percent to 44.4175 per dollar at
the 5.p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 44.32 earlier, the strongest level since
November 11. The currency market was closed yesterday and on
April 1.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.09 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.27
on April 1. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  Indian central bank’s “compulsions” to act against
inflation are strong, Deputy Governor  Subir Gokarn  said ahead of
the next monetary policy announcement on May 3.  The  Reserve Bank  of India last month increased  interest
rates  for the eighth time since mid-March 2010 and raised the
inflation forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
