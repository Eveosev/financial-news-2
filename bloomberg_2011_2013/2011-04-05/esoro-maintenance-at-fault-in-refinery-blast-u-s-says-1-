Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  didn’t adequately
maintain equipment at its Anacortes, Washington, refinery prior
to an explosion that killed seven workers last April, the  U.S.
Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board  said.  According to its preliminary findings, hydrogen corrosion
caused microscopic cracks in the walls of a heat exchanger in
the plant, board Chairman Rafael Moure-Eraso said in a video
posted April 1. “This led to a violent rupture of the
exchanger, followed by an intense fire as large volumes of
naphtha and hydrogen were released,” he said.  The accident, the deadliest at a U.S. refinery in five
years, prompted Washington state officials to propose a $2.3
million fine, their largest ever. Tesoro has appealed the fine.
An exchanger moves heat around a refinery to help it process
crude into fuels.  The company disagrees with Moure-Eraso’s description of
operations at Anacortes, Mike Marcy, a spokesman for San
Antonio-based Tesoro, said in an e-mailed statement. Marcy said
they “look forward to clarifying the facts as the board
completes its investigation.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
