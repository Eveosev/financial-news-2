Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  won’t cling to
independence if the Swiss biotechnology company doesn’t generate
shareholder value, Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel said in an
interview with Swiss Equity magazine.  “Independence is not an end in itself,” Clozel said in
the interview, which is to be published April 7. “Our
shareholders should earn money with Actelion. And if we can no
longer achieve this as an independent company, then we won’t
cling to our independence.”  Clozel said many investors he’s spoken with agree with him
that hedge fund Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd., which has nominated
candidates to Actelion’s board, is “only looking for short-term
profit.” The company’s biggest shareholders stand by the
company’s strategy, he told the magazine.  Actelion is profitable, has high  cash flow  and can finance
all of its activities by itself, Clozel said in the interview.
Actelion doesn’t need to follow the example of U.S. biotech
Genentech, which sought financial help from  Roche Holding AG (ROG) ,
Clozel told the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
