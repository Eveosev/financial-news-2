Profits at  Kenya ’s  publicly traded
companies  are estimated to grow an average 15 percent to 20
percent this year, Pinebridge Investments East Africa Ltd.
Senior Investment Manager Edward Gitahi said.  “The main drivers of net profit in 2011 will be the
buildings material and construction sector, and the financial
sector,” Gitahi told reporters today in the capital, Nairobi.
Company profit increased an average 33 percent in 2010, led by
the financial services industry, which jumped 61 percent, he
said.  Kenya’s economy is forecast to expand by 5 percent this
year, less than the company’s previous estimate of 6 percent,
due to the impact of a drought, Gitahi said. The government
expects the economy to grow 6.5 percent, Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  said on March 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
