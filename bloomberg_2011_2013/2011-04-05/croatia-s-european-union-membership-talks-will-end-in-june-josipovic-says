Croatian President Ivo Josipovic
said negotiations to join the European Union are set to conclude
in June, allowing the Adriatic Sea nation to become the next
member of the bloc in 2012.  “Absolutely we can wrap up the negotiations by the end of
June,” Josipovic told journalists at a conference in Dubrovnik,
 Croatia .  The former Yugoslav republic still has to complete
overhauling the judiciary, stamping out corruption, improving
competition and restructuring its money-losing shipyards. EU’s
Justice Commissioner  Viviane Reding  said on March 3 Croatia has
made “impressive progress” and has reached the “final stage”
in the negotiations.  EU Commissioner Jose Barroso is expected to meet with Prime
Minister Jadranka Kosor and other government officials this
week in the capital Zagreb.  Kosor said she had “great expectations” from the visit
and reiterated Croatia will have “all prerequisite conditions”
to wrap up the talks in June.  “I believe we can make it,” Kosor told journalists at the
same conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
