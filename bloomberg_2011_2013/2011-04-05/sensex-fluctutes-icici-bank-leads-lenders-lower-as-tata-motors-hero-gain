Indian stocks fluctuated. Lenders
fell as higher oil prices stoked concerns energy costs will fan
inflation. Automakers led by  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  advanced after
selling more vehicles last month.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-biggest bank, fell 0.7 percent,
while  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the third-largest, lost 0.2 percent. The
Bombay Stock Exchange’s BANKEX Index dropped, paring a two-week
rally. Oil yesterday settled at the highest since September 2008,
prompting concern inflation may lead to higher borrowing costs
in India. Tata Motors, India’s biggest truck maker, reached a
three-month high after sales rose 11 percent in March.  “Inflationary challenges remain and with  interest rates 
trending upwards, margins are likely to remain under pressure”
for banks, said  Jagannadham Thunuguntla , chief strategist at SMC
Global Securities Ltd., from  New Delhi . “Bank stocks are taking
a breather after rallying in the past few sessions.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, was
little changed at 19,686.82 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai.
The gauge, which swung between gains and losses seven times,
yesterday climbed to the highest level since Jan. 6. The S&P CNX
Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange was little changed at
5,910.05. The BSE 200 Index rose 0.3 percent to 2,424.77.  Crude for May delivery yesterday settled at the highest
level since Sept. 22, 2008.  India  relies on imports to meet
about 75 percent of its energy needs. The nation’s central bank
on March 17 signaled higher oil prices may fan inflation as it
raised rates for the eighth time in a year.  Record Sales  Tata Motors added 2 percent to 1,280 rupees, the highest
close since Jan. 5, while its April futures traded at 1,274
rupees. Sales climbed 11 percent to 83,363 vehicles in March,
the company said April 1.  Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (HH) , India’s top
motorcycle maker, advanced 1.6 percent to 1,643.25 rupees, its
11th day of gain, the longest winning run on record. Sales
surged 24 percent to a record 515,852 units in March from a year
earlier, the company said April 1.  “The domestic consumption story remains intact,” said D.K.
Aggarwal, chairman of SMC Wealth Management Services Ltd. in New
Delhi. “There is concern about oil prices and inflation, which
is not good for us.”  ICICI Bank fell 0.7 percent to 1,111.3 rupees, while HDFC
Bank lost 0.2 percent to 2,395.75 rupees. HDFC Ltd., the top
mortgage lender, declined 1 percent to 698.4 rupees.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s most valuable company,
dropped 0.3 percent to 1,047.65. Larsen & Toubro Ltd., the
biggest engineering company, slid 1.3 percent to 1,667.50 rupees.
The two companies have an 18 percent weighting in the benchmark.  Global Funds Return  The Sensex jumped 9.1 percent in March, the biggest monthly
advance since September, as foreign funds turned net buyers of
Indian stocks in 2011. Global funds purchased a net 43.5 billion
rupees ($977 million) of equities on March 31, April 1 and April
4, based on preliminary data from the National Stock Exchange.
That more than offset an outflow of 25 billion rupees from Jan.
3 through March 30, according to the most recent  data  from the
 Securities and Exchange Board of India .  “Shares have run up too fast, too soon,” said Jitendra Panda, senior vice-president at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. in
Mumbai. “Inflation remains a concern with high  oil prices . We
expect some correction and consolidation this week.” Motilal is
advising clients to refrain from buying shares, he said.  The Sensex has declined 4.7 percent this year as concerns
that rising interest costs will crimp economic growth. Companies
on the benchmark index trade at an average 15.5 times estimated
earnings, compared with 21.5 times in March 2010, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  India’s economic expansion and corporate earnings lured
foreign funds to buy a record $29.4 billion of local equities
last year and made the Sensex the best performer and most
expensive among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
