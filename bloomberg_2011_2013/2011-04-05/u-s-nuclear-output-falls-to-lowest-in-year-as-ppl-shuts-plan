U.S. nuclear-power output fell to
the lowest level in a year as  PPL Corp. (PPL)  shut the Susquehanna 2
reactor in  Pennsylvania , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide decreased by 655 megawatts, or
0.9 percent, from yesterday to 76,185 megawatts, or 75 percent
of capacity, the smallest amount since April 5, 2010, according
to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twenty-four of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  PPL closed the 1,140-megawatt Susquehanna 2 reactor after
it was operating at 88 percent of capacity yesterday. Another
unit at the site, the 1,149-megawatt Susquehanna 1, was
operating at full capacity. The plant is located in Luzerne
County, 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Allentown.  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  started the 1,100-megawatt McGuire 2 in
 North Carolina  and boosted the reactor to 10 percent of
capacity. Another unit at the site, the 1,100-megawatt McGuire
1, is operating at full power. The plant is located 15 miles
north of Charlotte.  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  said in a statement late yesterday it
remained unclear when the 838-megawatt Crystal River reactor in
 Florida  will start up as it conducts an engineering analysis of
concrete damage, or “delamination,” in the containment
building.  “We are doing a careful and systematic review of the new
delamination and the options to return the plant to service,”
Vincent Dolan, chief executive officer of Progress Energy
Florida, said in the statement. “The company cannot estimate a
return-to-service date.”  Startup Delayed  The unit has been shut for repairs since September 2009.
The utility said in August that the reactor would start in the
fourth quarter of 2010, then in November delayed that until the
first quarter of this year. The plant is located 70 miles north
of Tampa, Florida.  The damage occurred during maintenance to replace steam
generators, when crews created an opening in the structure that
caused separation of a portion of the concrete at the periphery
of the containment building.  Raleigh, North Carolina-based Progress spent about $150
million on the repair and $290 million on replacement power
costs to Dec. 31, it said in yesterday’s statement. Insurance
covered $181 million, the company said.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  boosted the 839-megawatt Saint Lucie 1
reactor in Florida to 92 percent of capacity from 80 percent
yesterday. Another reactor at the plant, the 839-megawatt Saint
Lucie 2, was shut. The station is located about 45 miles north
of Palm Beach.  Georgia Reactor  Southern Co. (SO)  increased output from the 1,109-megawatt
Vogtle 1 reactor in Georgia to 87 percent of capacity from 80
percent yesterday. The unit is returning from an outage that
began March 7.  The plant is located 26 miles southeast of Augusta. Another
reactor at the site, the 1,127-megawatt Vogtle 2, is operating
at full capacity.  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  increased output at the 1,235-megawatt
Perry nuclear reactor in  Ohio  to 86 percent of capacity from 80
percent yesterday. The plant is located on Lake Erie about 35
miles northeast of  Cleveland . FirstEnergy is based in Akron,
Ohio.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
