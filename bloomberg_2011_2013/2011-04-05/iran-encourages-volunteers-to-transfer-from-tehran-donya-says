Iran  is calling on public workers to
agree to a transfer out of Tehran, as part of an effort to
decrease the capital’s population,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  said, citing
the city governor’s deputy for planning, Nematollah Torki.  Volunteers may start signing up from May 22 and they will
benefit from incentives offered to those who have already
relocated from Tehran, Torki said, according to the newspaper.
Some 10,000 volunteers were transferred last year to other
provinces, he said.  Authorities said last year they would offer incentives,
including a salary raise of as much as 50 percent, to government
employees willing to relocate.  Tehran, with some 12 million residents, is among the
world’s most polluted cities and is built on several
seismological fault lines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
