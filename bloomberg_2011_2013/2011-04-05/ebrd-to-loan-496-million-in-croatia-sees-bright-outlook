The  European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development  will lend  Croatia  as much as 350 million euros
($496 million) this year as the Adriatic Sea economy attempts to
pull itself out of recession.  “Croatia’s future is bright,” Zsuzsanna Hargitai, the
head of the EBRD’s Croatian office, said in an interview in
Dubrovnik, Croatia. “This year we’ll be lending between 300
million euros to 350 million euros to finance energy, railways
and water projects,” she said.  Croatia’s economy may expand for the first time since 2008
and grow an estimated 1.5 percent this year, according to a
government estimate in November. The country is in the final
stage of negotiations with the EU and hopes to join the bloc in
2012.  The government has launched an economic recovery program in
April 2010, and has offered incentives to boost foreign direct
investment, which dropped 30 percent in the first nine months of
2010.  “Croatia has got a good policy framework for investment
and a good incentive” program, Hargitai said. “What’s lacking
is the implementation on the ground, where investors can be
faced with problems with permits, land deeds and the lack of
transparency created by various levels of authority.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
