Chile ’s peso slid for the first time
in five days after China, the biggest buyer of Chile’s main
export copper, raised interest rates in an attempt to forestall
an asset bubble.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 475.94 per  U.S. dollar  as of
9:24 a.m.  New York  time from 474.83 at yesterday’s close.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America-
Merrill Lynch had said China might pause in tightening after
three previous rate increases. Falling copper prices offset data
showing that Chile’s economy expanded at an unexpectedly fast
7.2 percent in February from a year earlier, boosting
expectations of a half-point interest-rate increase this month.  “Expectations on differentials on the interest rate will
have quite a minor impact compared to copper’s movement
following the announcement of rate increases in  China ,” said
Juan Pablo Castro, an economist at Banco Santander Chile in
Santiago. “If we see a strong fall in copper that will more
than compensate the impact we could have from expectations of a
higher interest rate increase.”  Copper for May delivery declined as much as 1 percent to
$4.2135 a pound in New York.  Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
reduced bets that the peso would fall against the dollar for a
fourth straight day to $1.9 billion on April 1, according to
central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
