Bulgaria  and  Russia ’s state-owned
Rosatom Corp. decided to freeze plans to build a nuclear power
plant in the Balkan country so authorities can conduct an
analysis on nuclear safety, Bulgaria’s National Electricity Co.
said today in a statement in Sofia.  “Rosatom has not taken a decision to freeze the Belena
plant,” Sergei Novikov, a spokesman in Moscow for Rosatom, said
today in Moscow. “No such bilateral documents were signed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
