Tokyo  Electric Power Co., operator
of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant stricken by the March 11
earthquake and tsunami in Japan, tumbled to a record low in
Tokyo trading after the company began dumping radioactive water
into the sea.  The stock plunged by the daily limit of 80 yen, or 18
percent to 362 yen, at the 3 p.m. market close on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, the lowest since its listing in August 1951.  “The news of the discharge of contaminated water was
negatively received while there is no sign that the situation is
settling down,” said Satoshi Yuzaki, Tokyo-based head of the
market information department at Takagi Securities Co.  The government approved the discharge so that Tepco, as the
utility is known, can drain turbine buildings for the No. 2 and
No. 3 reactors of water so radioactive it burned workers, the
chief cabinet secretary said.  The stock has lost 83 percent since March 10, the day
before the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami struck northeast
 Japan , compared with a drop of 9 percent by the Topix index.  To contact the reporters on the story:
