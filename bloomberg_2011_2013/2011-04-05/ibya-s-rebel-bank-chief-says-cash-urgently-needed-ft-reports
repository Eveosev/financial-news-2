The freeze on the Libyan regime’s
assets has also limited the opposition’s access to cash, the
Financial Times reported, citing Ahmed el-Sharif, head of the
opposition’s central bank.  Banks in rebel-held areas are short of currency and could
run out within weeks if access to Libyan assets abroad continues
to be denied, el-Sharif said, noting that there may not be
enough money to pay public-sector workers, the FT said. He said
he would recommend that oil exports cease unless the asset
freeze is lifted for the opposition, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
