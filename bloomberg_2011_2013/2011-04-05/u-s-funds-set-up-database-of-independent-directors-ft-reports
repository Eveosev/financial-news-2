The two biggest U.S. pension funds
by assets are starting a database of potential independent
directors, in an effort to tackle corporate-governance failures
that helped to cause the financial crisis, the Financial Times
reported.  The  California Public Employees’ Retirement System  and the
California State Teachers’ Retirement System hope the Diverse
Director DataSource will help to identify candidates with a
broader range of experience and opinions, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
