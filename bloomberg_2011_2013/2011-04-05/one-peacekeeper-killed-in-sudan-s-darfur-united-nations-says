Gunmen killed one peacekeeper from
the  United Nations  and  African Union  peacekeeping mission in
Sudan’s western region of  Darfur  today, the mission said.  The peacekeeper was killed when armed men ambushed a
patrol near the town of Kutum in North Darfur state, the mission
said in an e-mailed statement. The mission didn’t mention the
nationality of the peacekeeper. One gunmen was also killed in
the firefight, according to the statement, and two peacekeepers
were injured. One of the wounded was reported to be in serious
condition, the statement said.  Armed groups have targeted aid agencies and peacekeepers in
Darfur during a seven-year conflict between the government and
rebels. The UN estimates that about 300,000 people have died,
mainly through illness and starvation, while  Sudan ’s government
says violence-related deaths total 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
