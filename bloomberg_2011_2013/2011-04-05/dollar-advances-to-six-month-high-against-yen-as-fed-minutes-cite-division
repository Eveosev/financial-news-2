The dollar rose to a six-month high
against the yen after minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s March
15 meeting showed some policy makers said signs of a stronger
recovery may warrant a less-accommodative monetary policy.  The U.S. currency rose earlier after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that inflation must be watched
“extremely closely.” Sterling was the biggest winner versus
the dollar among the most-traded currencies as a report showed
the U.K.’s service industries accelerated at the fastest pace in
more than a year last month.  “We already know there’s a growing voice within the Fed
talking more hawkishly,” said David Mann, the New York-based
head of research in the Americas for  Standard Chartered .
“There’s a growing divergence within the Fed.”  The dollar appreciated 0.7 percent to 84.61 yen at 2:11
p.m. in  New York , from 84.06 yesterday, after touching 84.79,
the highest level since Sept. 24. The dollar traded at $1.4241
per euro, compared with $1.4221. The euro gained 0.8 percent to
120.50 yen, from 119.54.  The pound advanced as much as 1 percent to $1.6297 in the
biggest intraday rally since Jan. 31 on evidence the U.K.’s
economy is recovering.  Markit Economics Ltd. and the  Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply  said a gauge of U.K. services based on a
survey of companies rose in March to 57.1, the highest level in
13 months. The median forecast of 69 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for the gauge to stay at 52.6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
