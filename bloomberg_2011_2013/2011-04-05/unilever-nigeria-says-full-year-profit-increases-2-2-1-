Unilever Nigeria Plc (UNILEVER) , a consumer
goods manufacturer, said profit increased 2.2 percent in the
year through December as revenue climbed.  Net income rose to 4.18 billion naira ($27 million) from
4.09 billion naira a year earlier, it said in a statement
published on the Lagos-based Nigerian Stock Exchange’s website
yesterday. Revenue advanced to 46.8 billion naira from 44.5
billion naira, it said. The company will pay a final dividend of
1.1 naira a share.  “We expect the dividend announcement to be supportive of
the shares’ performance in the next few trading days given the
positive disposition of local investors to dividend
announcements,” Olumide Awe and Sholotan Olugbenga, analysts at
London-based CSL Stockbrokers Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients today.  Unilever shares closed unchanged at 23.66 naira at 2:30
p.m. in Lagos. They have fallen 12 percent this year, compared
with a 0.1 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
