European Commission President Jose Barroso comments on planned Europe-wide safety checks on nuclear
power plants following the atomic accident in  Japan . Barroso
spoke to the European Parliament today in Strasbourg,  France .  The commission, the European Union’s regulatory arm, is
drawing up the details of checks on the EU’s 143 nuclear plants.
The “stress tests” are scheduled to start in the second half
of the year.  “Should an installation fail the test, the question of
remedial actions remains open.”  “In case an upgrade is technically or economically not
feasible, reactors will have to be shut down and decommissioned.
However, it is possible to envisage situations where safety
upgrades are economically meaningful and technically feasible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
