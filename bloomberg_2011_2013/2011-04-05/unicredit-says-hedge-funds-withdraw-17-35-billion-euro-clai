UniCredit SpA (UCG)  said eight  hedge funds 
and one German association for shareholder rights withdrew a
17.35 billion-euro ($24.7 billion) claim against UniCredit and
others over the 2005 acquisition of HVB Group.  The former minority shareholders claimed that UniCredit had
induced HVB to “consent to detrimental actions” during and
after the merger of the two banks, UniCredit said in a statement
today. UniCredit didn’t identify the hedge funds or the minority
shareholders.  Allegations of damages related to the merger are still the
subject of other proceedings, as is a review in  Germany  of the
cash compensation paid to former minority shareholders,
UniCredit said.  UniCredit agreed to buy Germany’s HVB Group and its eastern
European units for 19.2 billion euros in June 2005 in what was
then  Europe ’s biggest cross-border banking takeover to date.  UniCredit and former Chief Executive Officer Alessandro
Profumo said the claim related to the merger is “unfounded as
all the transactions mentioned have been carried out on an
arm’s-length basis, also on the ground of independent external
opinions and evaluations,” according to a  statement  on Oct. 11,
2007.  A Munich, Germany, court ruled on April 24, 2008, that HVB
could require minority shareholders who owned less than 5
percent of the company to sell their shares.  Lorenzo Berneri, a spokesman for UniCredit in Milan,
declined to comment beyond the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
