New Jersey Devils leading scorer Ilya Kovalchuk won’t play tonight in the team’s second-round  National
Hockey League  playoff game against the Philadelphia Flyers due
to an unspecified injury.  Kovalchuk, 29, was hurt in the first-round series against
the  Florida Panthers , the team said on its Twitter page. The
Flyers lead the best-of-seven series 1-0 after a 4-3 overtime
victory on April 29. The Devils weren’t more specific about the
injury.  A three-time All-Star, Kovalchuk led the Devils this season
with 37 goals and 83 points. In eight playoff games, the forward
has three goals and three assists.  In 2010, Kovalchuk signed a 15-year, $100 million contract
with the Devils. His 406 career goals rank seventh on the NHL’s
active list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
