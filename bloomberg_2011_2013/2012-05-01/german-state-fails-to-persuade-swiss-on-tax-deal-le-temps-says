The president of  Germany ’s Baden-
Wuerttemberg state, Winfried Kretschmann, failed to persuade
 Switzerland ’s government to implement a tax agreement earlier
than previously agreed, Le Temps  reported .  Kretschmann is concerned the Jan. 1, 2013, start date gives
German owners of Swiss bank accounts too much time to transfer
their assets elsewhere, the newspaper said, citing Kretschmann,
who met four members of Switerland’s seven-person cabinet
yesterday to discuss the matter.  Switzerland doesn’t intend to renegotiate an agreement that
has already been approved by Germany’s parliament, Le Temps
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
