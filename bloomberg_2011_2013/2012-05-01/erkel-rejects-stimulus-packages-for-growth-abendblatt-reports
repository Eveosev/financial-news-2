German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
rejected the introduction of stimulus packages to create
economic growth in Europe,  Hamburger Abendblatt  reported in a
preview of an article that will run tomorrow, citing Merkel.  It is “important that we break with the idea that growth
always costs a lot of money and must be the result of expensive
stimulus programs,” Merkel said in answer to questions posed by
Abendblatt. She instead proposed programs that need “political
courage and creativity rather than billions of euros,” the
newspaper reported.  Europe must implement structural reforms that eliminate
growth obstacles and improve competition and should focus on
education, research, a sensible salary development and the
opening up of job markets to achieve sustainable growth,
Abendblatt cited Merkel as saying. The way out of  Europe ’s
crisis rests on two pillars -- solid finances and measures for
growth and employment, the German chancellor said.  Germany is willing to strengthen the  European Investment
Bank  to help it provide more support, Merkel told Abendblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
