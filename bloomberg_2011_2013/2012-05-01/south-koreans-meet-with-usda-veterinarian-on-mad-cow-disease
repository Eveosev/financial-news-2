A South Korea delegation in the U.S.
to examine food-safety procedures following last week’s
disclosure that an animal with mad cow disease had been found in
 California  met yesterday with the Agriculture Department’s chief
veterinarian,  John Clifford , the agency said.  The group is visiting U.S. laboratories, farms and
rendering facilities to determine the effectiveness of U.S.
measures against mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy.  “The  United States  remains confident in the safety of U.S.
beef and dairy products,” Matt Herrick, a USDA spokesman, said
in an e-mail after the meeting.  The South Korea, which is experiencing public pressure to
curtail U.S. beef purchases, said last week it would strengthen
quarantine inspections. The government didn’t impose a ban on
U.S. imports as it saw “no problem” with the safety of the
beef given that the disease was found in a dairy cow more than
30 months old, Agriculture Minister Suh Kyu Yong told reporters
last week. The country only accepts meat from younger animals.  South Korea  was the third-biggest buyer of U.S. beef before
it banned imports of the product after the nation’s first mad
cow case in 2003. It resumed imports in 2008 amid widespread
street protests against the move.  The latest U.S. mad cow discovery was the nation’s fourth,
and the first since 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
