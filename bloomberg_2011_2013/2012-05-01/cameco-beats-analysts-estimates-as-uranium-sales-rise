(Corrects description of Fukushima incident in fifth
paragraph.)  Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the world’s largest
uranium producer, reported first-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates as sales of the nuclear-reactor fuel rose.  Net income increased to C$132 million ($133.6 million), or
33 cents a share, from C$91 million, or 23 cents, a year
earlier, the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based company said today in
a statement. Profit excluding one-time items was 31 cents a
share, topping the 25-cent average of 10  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales increased to C$563 million from C$461 million.  Uranium sales rose to 8.1 million pounds from 6.1 million a
year earlier, topping the 6.6 million estimated by Edward Sterck, a London-based analyst at Bank of Montreal. The average
cost of uranium sales fell to C$31.97 a pound from C$32.21 a
year earlier.  “Our full-year expectations for uranium sales volumes have
been biased toward the end of the year,” Sterck said in an
interview before the results were released. “Higher-than-
expected sales could indicate the company sold more into the
 spot market .”  Increased uranium sales may help offset lower prices
following last year’s tsunami and meltdown at Tokyo Electric
Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant.  Cameco was unchanged at C$21.86 yesterday in Toronto. The
shares have gained 19 percent this year.  (Cameco scheduled a conference call at 1 p.m.  New York  time
