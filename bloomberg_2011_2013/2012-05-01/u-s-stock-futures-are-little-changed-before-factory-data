U.S. stocks advanced, sending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  to the highest level since December
2007, after a better-than-estimated manufacturing report
bolstered investors’ optimism in the world’s largest economy.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and Alcoa Inc. climbed at
least 1.8 percent to pace rallies among the biggest companies.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average, a proxy for economic
growth, increased 1.1 percent.  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  soared 15
percent as it forecast a profit after selling some stores in the
U.S. and Canada. Stocks  pared gains  after Apple Inc., the
world’s most valuable company, reversed an earlier advance.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6 percent to
1,405.82 at 4 p.m.  New York  time, the highest level since April
3. The Dow increased 65.69 points, or 0.5 percent, to 13,279.32.
The Russell 2000 Index of small companies retreated 0.1 percent
to 815.89. About  6.7 billion  shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges today, or almost in line with the three-month average.  “The economy is starting to get on its own two feet,”
said Wayne Lin, a money manager at Baltimore-based Legg Mason
Inc. His firm oversees $643.3 billion. “Manufacturing is
forward-looking. It leads what the actual economic activity
tends to end up being. It tells us that firms are being a bit
less conservative. Confidence is starting to reemerge.”  Stocks rose as  manufacturing  unexpectedly expanded in April
at the fastest pace in 10 months. The report added to optimism
after data showed growth in Chinese manufacturing. Investors
also watched corporate earnings as  74 percent  of  S&P 500 
companies that reported results since April 10 have beaten
projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Good Value  Today’s gain extended this year’s advance in the S&P 500 to
12 percent. The index still trades at  14.3 times  reported
earnings, below the average since 1954 of 16.4. Former Federal
Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  said U.S. stocks offer good
value and are likely to rise as earnings increase over time.  “Stocks are very cheap,” Greenspan, who served as Fed
chairman from August 1987 to January 2006, said today at the
Bloomberg Washington Summit hosted by Bloomberg Link. “There is
no place for earnings to grow except into stock prices.”  Better-than-estimated earnings and economic data show the
Fed doesn’t need to add monetary stimulus at this time,
according to  Kevin Rendino , a money manager at New York-based
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  The benchmark gauge has more than doubled since
reaching a 12-year low on  March 2009 (SPX)  amid government stimulus.  “We don’t need QE3 right now,” said Rendino, referring to
a so-called third round of quantitative easing, or asset
purchases to stimulate the economy. His firm oversees $3.68
trillion as the world’s largest asset manager. “We need to have
an economy that can stand on its own.”  Harbinger of Gains  Equities rebounded after the S&P 500  halted  a four-month
gain in April. Yet a rally of more than 10 percent in the first
four months of the year has been a harbinger of gains in May,
said Bespoke Investment Group. In the 19 times since 1927 that
the S&P 500 has had such a start to the year, it has followed
with an average gain of  2.2 percent  in May, Bespoke data show.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most tied to
the economy rose 1.6 percent. JPMorgan jumped 1.9 percent to
$43.79. Intel, the largest chipmaker, climbed 2 percent to
$28.95.  Alcoa (AA) , the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, increased 2.5
percent to $9.97.  Sears Holdings soared 15 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $62.05. The retailer said first-quarter profit excluding some
items was as much as $195 million after selling stores in the
U.S. and Canada, compared with a loss a year earlier. It plans
to spin off its Hometown and Outlet stores in the third quarter,
possibly giving Chairman Edward Lampert an opportunity to hold a
larger stake in the new publicly traded company.  Beating Estimates  Archer Daniels Midland Co. rallied 7.1 percent to $33.02.
The largest grain processor  topped  analysts’ profit estimates
for the first time in four quarters after international grain
sales and oilseed processing in North America improved.  A measure of  energy shares  had the biggest advance among 10
industries in the S&P 500 today, rising 1.4 percent, as 39 of
its 44 stocks gained.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  jumped 6.3 percent to $19.60. The
company will name an independent chairman to replace Aubrey McClendon and halt an incentive program that allowed the chief
executive officer to amass personal stakes in thousands of
company-operated wells.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  added 2.5 percent to $75.06. The
second-largest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas producer by
market value said first-quarter  profit  rose on higher crude
prices and a $1.8 billion gain from an Algerian tax settlement.  Bottom Signs  Solar stocks rallied after Citigroup Inc. raised its
recommendation on the industry, citing “signs of a near-term
bottom.”  SunPower Corp. (SPWR)  surged 7.8 percent to $6.05.  Trina
Solar Ltd. (TSL)  increased 3 percent to $7.48.  The S&P 500 pared an advance of more than 1.2 percent after
 Apple (AAPL)  fell 0.3 percent to $582.13, capping its fourth straight
loss. The shares jumped 2.2 percent earlier today.  Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  slumped 8 percent, the biggest loss in
the S&P 500, to $19.87. The door-to-door cosmetics seller that’s
the target of a $10 billion takeover bid from Coty Inc. reported
first-quarter profit that trailed estimates, hurt by higher
labor and materials costs.  Emerson Electric Co. (EMR)  dropped 6.4 percent to $49.18. The
maker of industrial equipment  reported  second-quarter revenue
and profit that missed estimates.  Herbalife Ltd. (HLF)  tumbled 20 percent, the most since 2009, to
$56.30. The maker of nutritional supplements and weight-
management products slumped as hedge-fund manager  David Einhorn 
asked executives why it has stopped providing information
tracking certain groups of its distributors in its  filings .  Trend Charts  Stock market trend charts and investor sentiment are
signaling the S&P 500 may surpass its  2012 high  before the rally
gives way to a 10 percent decline, according to UBS AG.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities is likely to exceed
this year’s  peak  of 1,419.04 and climb to 1,460, after it held
last month above its March 6 low, said Michael Riesner and Marc
Mueller, Zurich-based analysts with UBS. The S&P 500 halted a
five-day slump on April 10 at 1,358.59. Two weeks later, it
rebounded from another drop at 1,358.79.  The level of 1,358 “represents a new pivotal support for
the SPX,” the analysts wrote in a note yesterday, referring to
the S&P 500’s ticker. “As long as the market trades above this
level, the U.S. market remains bullish biased,” they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
