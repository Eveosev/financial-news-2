CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched
television network, said first-quarter profit climbed 80 percent
on sales of reruns and higher fees from pay TV systems.  Net income rose to $363 million, or 54 cents a share, from
$202 million, or 29 cents, a year ago, New York-based CBS said
today in a  statement . Excluding items, profit was about 54
cents, exceeding the 44-cent average of 27 analysts’ estimates
 compiled  by Bloomberg.  CBS’s television network and stations are increasing
revenue through fees cable systems pay to carry their signals.
The fees almost doubled to $60 million in the period,  Michael Morris , an analyst at Davenport & Co., wrote in a report today.
The network is also collecting a larger share of the cable fees
paid to its affiliate stations, he said.  “We see this as a significant ongoing growth opportunity
that remains under appreciated in the current consensus
estimates and market valuation,” wrote Morris, who recommends
buying the shares.  Revenue climbed 12 percent to $3.92 billion, exceeding the
$3.78 billion average of 24 analysts’ estimates. Results for the
quarter included an after-tax $16 million gain from early
retirement of debt and an after-tax impairment expense of $14
million, the company said.  Advertising sales increased 8 percent at the network. TV
station revenue rose 2 percent while radio station revenue
declined by the same percentage. Revenue from the outdoor
billboard unit gained 1 percent.  Money from syndication, the sale of reruns to other
broadcast and cable programmers, climbed 39 percent. In the
period, CBS agreed to provide non-exclusive rights to “CSI:
Miami” to  AMC Networks Inc. (AMCX)  for about $80 million, Morris
estimated.  CBS, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , rose 2.2
percent to $34.16 in extended trading. It gained 0.1 percent to
$33.42 at the close of trading in  New York  and is the top
performer of the past year in the 16-stock S&P 500 Media Index
with a gain of 33 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
