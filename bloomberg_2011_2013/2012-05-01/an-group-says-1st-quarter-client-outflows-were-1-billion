Man Group Plc (EMG) , the world’s biggest
publicly traded hedge-fund manager, said client outflows
totalled $1 billion in the first quarter.  Clients redeemed $4.1 billion from Man Group’s investment
funds, which was partly offset by $3.1 billion of sales, the
London-based company said in a statement today. Assets under
management grew to $59 billion as of March 31 from $58.4 billion
at the end of last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
