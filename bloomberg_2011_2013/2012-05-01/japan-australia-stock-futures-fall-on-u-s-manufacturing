Japanese  shares  declined, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average closing at a 10-week low, as the yen
strengthened after Spain entered recession and companies from
Sharp Corp. to  Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035)  missed earnings estimates.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest consumer-electronics exporter,
lost 3.9 percent. Sharp, Japan’s largest producer of liquid-
crystal displays, plunged 9.3 percent after forecasting a wider-
than-estimated loss. Tokyo Electron tumbled 8.3 percent after
the chip-equipment maker said profit fell more than expected.  “The worst catalyst is the strengthening yen. Investors
can’t get optimistic about the Japanese economy,” said Koji
Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, a unit of
Japan’s fifth-biggest lender by market value. “The number of
companies where earnings are improving as much as investors’
expectations is relatively small.”  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.8 percent to 9,350.95 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, its lowest since Feb. 16. Volume was more than
10 percent lower than the 30-day average. The broader  Topix (TPX) 
Index lost 1.8 percent to 789.49, with more than four times as
many shares declining as advancing.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  added 0.1
percent today. The gauge lost 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday
after a report showed U.S. business activity expanded at the
slowest pace since November 2009.  Stocks also fell after Spain’s economy entered its second
recession since 2009, adding to concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
worsening.  Gross domestic product  fell 0.3 percent, the Madrid-
based National Statistics Institute said yesterday.  Yen Strengthens  Sony, which gets more than 40 percent of its sales from
Europe and the U.S., lost 3.9 percent to 1,265 yen.  Nissan Motor
Co. (7201) , a carmaker that gets almost 80 percent of its revenue
overseas, slipped 4.1 percent to 802 yen.  The euro weakened to as low as 105.47 yen today in Tokyo,
compared with 106.64 yen at the close of  stock trading  on April
27. The dollar also depreciated to 79.68 yen today from 80.87
yen, the weakest level since February, cutting the value of some
overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  “The yen strengthened above the psychologically important
barrier of 80 yen per dollar, which means investors’ hopes that
the yen would weaken toward the end of this year were frustrated.
Investors need to review their strategies,” said Fumiyuki
Nakanishi, a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  Sharp plunged 9.3 percent to 468 yen, the biggest decline
on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , after forecasting a wider-than-expected full-
year loss amid slow demand for televisions. The maker of Aquos
televisions said after close of market on April 27 it will
probably post a loss of 30 billion yen ($376 million) for the
year ending March 31, compared with the 7.6 billion-yen average
loss forecast of 23 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Tokyo Electron Drops  Tokyo Electron tumbled 8.3 percent to 4,085 yen after the
world’s second-biggest maker of semiconductor production
equipment said net income fell 49 percent to 36.7 billion yen,
missing its forecast by 8.2 percent. The company predicted
profit will drop 18 percent this fiscal year as sales are hurt
by an oversupply of equipment used to make flat-panel displays
and solar cells.  In  Japan , almost half of the Topix’s 1,672 companies are
scheduled to report earnings this and next week. Of the 401
companies that reported results since April 10, 87 have missed
estimates while 104 have exceeded expectations, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The Topix has fallen about 9.5 percent from this year’s
peak on March 27 amid renewed concern about Europe’s debt crisis
and signs the U.S. recovery is slowing. Shares on the index
trade for an average of 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.2
times for the  S&P 500 . A number less than one means that
companies can be bought for less than value of their assets.  Kikkoman Corp., Japan’s biggest soy sauce maker, gained  the
most  on the Nikkei 225, jumping 4.3 percent to 979 yen after
forecasting profit will rise 11 percent to 10 billion yen in the
year started April 1. The company also said it will spend as
much as 5 billion yen to buy back up to 2.9 percent of its
outstanding shares.  -- With assistance from Toshiro Hasegawa in Japan. Editors:  Jim Powell   To contact the reporter on this story:
