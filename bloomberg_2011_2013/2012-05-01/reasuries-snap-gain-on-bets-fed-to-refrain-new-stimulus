Treasuries stayed lower following a
decline yesterday before the U.S. announces today the sizes of
3-, 10-, and 30-year auctions scheduled for next week.  The government will probably sell $32 billion of 3-year
notes, $24 billion of 10-year securities and $16 billion of the
so-called long bonds over three days starting May 8, according
to Wrightson ICAP LLC, an economic advisory company in  Jersey
City , New Jersey. Treasuries fell yesterday after an industry
report showed U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly gained in April.  U.S. 10-year  rates  were little changed at 1.95 percent as
of 9:40 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.
The 2 percent security due in February 2022 changed hands at 100
14/32. The 10-year yield slid to a record low of 1.67 percent
Sept. 23. The average over the past decade is 3.83 percent.  “To argue that the bond market is suggesting optimism on
the economy, with 10-year yields below 2 percent, is a little
tough,” said Justin Hoogendoorn, a fixed-income strategist at
 Bank of Montreal (BMO)  unit BMO Capital Markets in  Chicago . He said
the reaction to the manufacturing data showed “at the margin,
there’s a little optimism.”  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index rose to
54.8 in April from 53.4 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s report showed. Readings greater than 50 signal
growth, and the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a decline to 53.  Maturing Debt  There will be $36.7 billion of Treasury securities maturing
and available for reinvestment next week, and the sales will
raise $35.3 billion of new cash, according to Wrightson.  The U.S. may also announce plans to sell floating-rate
securities,  Mary Miller , the Treasury Department’s
undersecretary for domestic finance, said Feb. 1.  Payrolls rose by 161,000 in April after a 120,000 gain in
March, while the jobless rate stayed at 8.2 percent, according
to economist forecasts before the Labor Department report May 4.  Three voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee
said they don’t see a need to ease policy further as the U.S.
economy maintains its expansion.  Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker 
said in Washington that more monetary stimulus risks stoking
inflation while doing little to strengthen the recovery. San
Francisco’s  John Williams  said the outlook he expects doesn’t
warrant more bond buying, and Atlanta’s  Dennis Lockhart  repeated
that he’s skeptical of the benefits of such action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
