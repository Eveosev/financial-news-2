Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
President  Dennis Lockhart  and Chicago’s  Charles Evans  disagreed
over whether policy makers should let inflation rise to 3
percent as they try to spur growth.  Lockhart said that prices accelerating at a 3 percent rate
or faster make him “pretty nervous,” while Evans said that the
central bank’s 2 percent inflation target is “not a ceiling.”
The Fed hasn’t done enough to describe its tolerance for
inflation, Evans said. Both Fed presidents spoke on a panel in
Beverly Hills, California.  “We do allow the possibility” that inflation will top 2
percent, Evans said. “We want a vibrant economy.”  Still, Evans said that the  Federal Open Market Committee 
has “no taste” for policy that would allow inflation to run at
a much higher rate, such as 6 percent.  “That would not be the right thing to do,” Evans said.
“I certainly agree with that.”  Lockhart, who votes on the FOMC this year, reiterated his
view that he’s “skeptical” additional bond buying by the
central bank would strengthen the recovery.  Evans, who doesn’t vote on the FOMC in 2012, said he
doesn’t “see the need” for “strong accommodation” going away
until the  U.S. economy  expands at a 4 percent rate for some
years.  “I think we’re going to need more of this,” Evans said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
