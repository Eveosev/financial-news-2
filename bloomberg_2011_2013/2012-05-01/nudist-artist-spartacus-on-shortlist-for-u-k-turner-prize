A performance artist who changed her
name to Spartacus, lives in a nudist colony and had the audience
voting in a five-hour play last year is one of four nominees for
the  Turner Prize , the U.K.’s top contemporary-art award.  Spartacus Chetwynd, 38, uses homemade costumes, puppets and
props to stage humorous events. Last year, as Britain held a
referendum on the voting system, she had visitors cast ballots
to determine where they ended up. Some were thrust down an
inflatable slide to a basement called “Dantescape,” paved with
severed limbs and litter bags and featuring marionettes acting
out a Biblical story.  The three other nominees are: Luke Fowler, whose films
splice archive footage of faded public figures with his own;
Paul Noble, who makes giant pencil sketches that start with a
word; and Elizabeth Price, whose videos focus on objects.  Tate Britain Director Penelope Curtis, who chairs the five-
person jury, said this year’s finalists were “artists who
broadcast slowness.”  “It’s not a quick fix,” she said after a slide-show
presentation of the shortlist. “None of these are something you
can get in a few minutes.”  Works by the finalists will be shown in a Tate Britain
exhibition opening on Oct. 2. The winner will be announced on
Dec. 3.  Information:  http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/   Today’s Muse highlights include: Mark Beech on  music ,
