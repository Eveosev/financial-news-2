Newcastle thermal  coal prices  fell
below $100 a metric ton to the lowest level since October 2010
as demand from  China  weakened and supply to  Asia  from countries
including  South Africa  and the U.S. increased.  The price for the power-station fuel at the Australian port
of Newcastle, the benchmark contract for Asia, dropped $1.60, or
1.6 percent, to $99.95 a metric ton in the week ended April 27,
according to IHS McCloskey, a Petersfield, U.K.-based provider
of data. It declined for a third week.  China’s imports of thermal and steelmaking coal declined 15
percent in the first three months of this year from the fourth
quarter in 2011, Bloomberg calculations based on customs data
showed. Shipments from South Africa from January to March more
than quadrupled from the same period a year earlier to 3.8
million tons, customs data showed.  “It’s an absence of Chinese demand,”  Mark Pervan , head of
commodity research at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) 
in  Melbourne , said by telephone today. “The perception is that
the Chinese are still well-stocked. You’re probably also seeing
a lot more South African coal moving into India and China.”  Chinese prices are more expensive than international
varieties. The difference in southern China for thermal coal
delivered from the northern port of Qinhuangdao compared with
shipments from Newcastle expanded in March to as much as $8.30 a
ton, the widest since August 2010, according to data from CLSA
Ltd.  ‘Well Supplied’  “Newcastle coal prices are very much hinged on Chinese
coal prices,” Pervan said. “Chinese prices haven’t fallen too
far so the arbitrage is still fairly positive for imports,
suggesting that they must be well-supplied.”  Tohoku Electric Power Co. Inc agreed to pay  Xstrata Plc (XTA) 
about $115 a ton for supplies from April 2012 to March 2013,
Platts reported March 30. Japanese power companies paid a record
$129.85 a ton last year in annual contracts with Xstrata, the
world’s biggest exporter of the fuel, after rain in Australia,
Indonesia and Colombia cut output.  Japan  is the second-largest importer of the power-station
fuel behind China. Shipments of coal from the U.S. to China rose
14.8 percent in March from a year earlier to 524,723 tons,
according to customs data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
