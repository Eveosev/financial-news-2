Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
most popular social-networking service, expects to begin
marketing its initial public offering to investors as soon as
next week, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The person declined to be identified because the plans
haven’t been made public. Facebook  executives  will use the so-
called road show to outline their business to prospective
investors, a process that typically ends within about two weeks.  That timing indicates that Facebook could complete the sale
before the end of the month, after updating its IPO filing with
regulators by the end of this week. Facebook filed in February
for a public debut that could give it a value of $75 billion to
$100 billion, people with knowledge of the plans have said. The
 Menlo Park , California-based company, which has more than 900
million users, is seeking $5 billion in what would be the
largest Internet IPO on record.  Facebook executives would use the road show to discuss
growth prospects that lifted  sales  45 percent to $1.06 billion
in the first quarter. They’ll also face questions over the rise
in costs that trimmed net income 12 percent to $205 million in
the March period.  The company plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock
Market and plans to trade under the symbol “FB.”  Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for Facebook, declined to
comment. The technology blog AllThingsDigital  reported  yesterday
that the road show may start next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
