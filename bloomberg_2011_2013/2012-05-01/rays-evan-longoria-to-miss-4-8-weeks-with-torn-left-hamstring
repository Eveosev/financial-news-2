All-Star third baseman Evan Longoria
will miss the next four to eight weeks for the  Tampa Bay Rays 
with a partially torn left hamstring.  Longoria, 26, was injured two nights ago against the
 Seattle Mariners  while running to second base on an unsuccessful
stolen-base attempt. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list
yesterday.  A three-time All-Star, Longoria is hitting .329 with four
home runs and 19 runs batted in over 23 games this season. He
hit a career-low .244 with 31 homers and 99 RBIs last year.  “It’s just one of those things,” Longoria told reporters
yesterday. “I’ve done everything that I can do to try to
prevent these kind of things. My hamstring just doesn’t
cooperate with me sometimes.”  The Rays are in first place in the American League Eastern
Division with a 16-8 record, leading the  Baltimore Orioles  by
one game and the  New York  Yankees by 2 1/2 games.  “He’s always been a pretty good healer,” Rays Executive
Vice President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman said on
the  team’s website . “He’s had some hamstring issues in the past
and has come back from them pretty quickly.  ‘‘We’re not going to put a firm timeline on it, but to get
back here, I would say a best-case scenario is for him to get
back before six weeks or around six weeks,” Friedman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
