Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR) , the U.S. auto-
rental chain, rose the most in more than two years in  New York 
trading after forecasting annual profit that topped analysts’
estimates on higher values for used cars.  Avis jumped 16 percent to $15.28 at 9:40 a.m., the biggest
percentage rise in intraday trading since June 2009. The shares
had gained 23 percent this year before today.  Avis, based in Parsippany,  New Jersey , said it expects
adjusted profit of $2.35 to $2.65 a share this year. Analysts in
a Bloomberg survey had predicted $1.59, the average of seven
estimates. Fleet costs in North America will be 3 percent to 8
percent lower on a per-unit basis than originally forecast, Avis
said in a statement.  “Our recent experience in selling used vehicles in  North
America  has been outstanding, and we have revised our outlook
for fleet costs accordingly,” David Wyshner, Avis’s chief
financial officer, said in the statement.  Sales in the first quarter were $1.6 billion, the company
said in a preliminary statement of results. Four analysts in a
Bloomberg survey had  estimated  $1.61 billion, on average. Annual
revenue will be as much as $7.6 billion compared with $7.4
billion, the average of five estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
Avis is scheduled to release full first-quarter results May 7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
