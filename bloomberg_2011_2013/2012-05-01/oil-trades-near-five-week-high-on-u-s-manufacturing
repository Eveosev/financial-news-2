Oil slid from the highest level in
five weeks as increasing crude stockpiles in the U.S. and
declining industrial output in  Europe  fanned concern that global
demand may weaken.  Futures in  New York  dropped as much as 0.6 percent. U.S.
crude inventories rose 2.04 million barrels last week, the fifth
gain in six weeks, the  American Petroleum Institute  said
yesterday. Euro-area manufacturing shrank for a ninth month in
April, while France,  Italy  and  Greece  plan elections this
weekend. Prices advanced 1.2 percent yesterday after an index of
U.S. manufacturing increased at the fastest pace in 10 months.  “Concerns about Europe continue to weigh on risk,”
 Michael Hewson , a London-based analyst at CMC Market, which
handles about $240 million a day in U.S. crude contracts, said
today in an e-mailed response to questions. “There’s still a
lot of uncertainty ahead of this weekend’s political events in
France, Greece and Italy. Economic data continue to disappoint
in Europe.”  Crude for June delivery declined as much as 62 cents to
$105.54 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It was at $105.84 at 1:30 p.m. London time.
The contract yesterday gained $1.29 to $106.16, the highest
close since March 27. Futures are up 7.1 percent this year.  Brent oil for June settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was down 57 cents at $119.09 a barrel.
The European benchmark contract traded at a $13.32  premium  to
New York futures, compared with $13.31 yesterday, the narrowest
gap based on closing prices since Jan. 31.  European Economy  Unemployment in countries that share the euro rose to the
highest in almost 15 years, and manufacturing contracted for a
ninth consecutive month, adding to signs the economy continues
to weaken.  The jobless rate in the 17-nation euro area increased to
10.9 percent in March from 10.8 percent in February, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the highest since April 1997, when the rate reached a
record at the time of 10.9 percent, according to data Bloomberg
News has compiled since 1990. A gauge of manufacturing in Europe
fell to 45.9 in April from 47.7 in March, Markit Economics said.  The  European Central Bank  will probably keep its benchmark
 interest rate  at a record-low 1 percent tomorrow, according to
all 58 economists in a Bloomberg survey. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on April 25 that European leaders need to create a
“growth compact” as spending cuts across the region damp
activity and prompt a backlash among citizens.  Oil Supplies  U.S. crude  supplies  probably climbed to 375.5 million
barrels in the week ended April 27, the highest in more than 21
years, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News. The Energy Department will release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington  today.  Gasoline inventories are expected to have fallen 1.5
million barrels, extending a 10-week run of declines, the survey
showed. The API yesterday said supplies  decreased  3.9 million
barrels.  Gasoline futures for June delivery were up 0.07 percent at
$3.0976 a gallon in New York, after losing 2.7 percent
yesterday, the most since Feb. 28.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index climbed
to 54.8 last month, according to the Tempe, Arizona-based
group’s report yesterday. The reading exceeded the most
optimistic forecast of 79 economists surveyed by Bloomberg and
was the highest since June. Readings greater than 50 signal
growth.  China’s Factories  A Chinese manufacturing index rose in April, signaling that
a rebound in the world’s second-biggest economy may help to
offset constraints on global growth from austerity measures in
Europe.  The 49.3 final reading of a purchasing managers’ index from
HSBC Holdings Plc and  Markit Economics  today compares with a
preliminary 49.1 reported on April 23 and a final 48.3 in March.
A separate index released yesterday by China’s statistics bureau
and logistics federation was at 53.3, indicating the fastest
growth in a year.  “China data are still in contraction territory on HSBC
measure, which continues to paint a mixed picture,” Hewson
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
