Average balances of 401(k)  retirement
plans  were about 62 percent higher as of March 31 than the first
quarter of 2009, when the stock market reached a 12-year low,
according to  Fidelity Investments .  The average account balance in the U.S. was $74,600
compared with $46,200 at the end of the first quarter of 2009,
according to a report released today by the Boston-based mutual-
 fund manager . The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  fell about 40
percent in the 12 months ended March 31, 2009.  The stock market recovery and renewed commitment to saving
has driven the increase,  Beth McHugh , vice president of market
insights for Fidelity, said in an interview yesterday.  “We’re seeing the benefits of strong markets,” said
McHugh. “We saw the account balance growth more attributable to
the market than contributions.”  Stock market performance accounted for about 80 percent of
the average $5,500 increase in the first quarter of 2012
compared with the prior quarter, while the remaining 20 percent
was from employer and worker contributions, Fidelity said. The
 S&P 500  rose about  12 percent  in the first three months of this
year.  The growth in the accounts comes as Americans continue to
say they’re worried about outliving their savings and Congress
weighs limiting contributions or reducing the tax advantages of
the plans.  Workers’ confidence in their ability to retire remains
historically low, with about 14 percent saying they were very
certain they’d have enough to live on comfortably, according to
the  Employee Benefit Research Institute , a Washington-based
nonprofit that studies employee benefits, in a March survey.
That compares with a high of 27 percent in 2007.  Capping Contributions  The U.S. House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing in
April on retirement savings as Congress seeks to overhaul the
nation’s tax code and reduce the deficit. Proposals to alter the
benefits have included reducing the amount that can be
contributed or replacing deductions for savings with credits.
Tax incentives for retirement accounts cost the government more
than $130 billion in revenue this year, according to the Joint
Committee on Taxation.  A 401(k) plan generally lets employees defer a portion of
their wages to the account on a pretax basis. Contributions are
 limited  to $17,000 for 2012 and those age 50 or older may set
aside an additional $5,500, according to the  Internal Revenue
Service .  Legislators and regulators from the Departments of Labor to
Treasury have been looking at Americans’ retirement security
because  life expectancies  are increasing and savings have
shifted from traditional pension plans, where employers
generally provided retired employees with lifetime payments, to
401(k) accounts that individuals largely are responsible for
funding.  Low Savings  About 60 percent of U.S. workers said they have less than
$25,000 in savings and investments, according to the EBRI
survey.  Fidelity, the largest provider of 401(k)s, has almost 12
million participants in about 20,000 employer-sponsored defined
contribution plans. The mutual-fund manager changed its average
balance calculation last year to include 401(k) accounts that
are sold through advisers as well as directly through the
company, McHugh said. Using the prior methodology, average
account balances were $74,900 at the end of the first quarter
last year, Fidelity data show.  About 10 percent of workers increased their savings rate
during the first quarter of this year, compared with 4 percent
who decreased it, according to the report. The corresponding
percentages in the three months ended March 31, 2009, were 5.7
percent who increased their savings rate and 6.4 percent who
decreased it, McHugh said.  Not Shy  “Even with the market and its unpredictability we’re not
necessarily seeing people shy away from contributing,” said
McHugh, who is based in Covington,  Kentucky . Participants saved
8 percent on average of their  salaries , which was unchanged from
last year, she said.  The majority of plans administered by Fidelity offer
workers the ability to automatically increase their savings rate
each year, usually by 1 percent, said McHugh.  Americans held $3.1 trillion in 401(k)s as of Dec. 31,
according to the Washington-based  Investment Company Institute ,
a trade group for the mutual-fund industry.  The Fidelity data on average balances looks at single
accounts and doesn’t include additional savings workers may have
in individual retirement accounts or multiple 401(k)s, said
McHugh. The median account balance at the end of the first
quarter was $23,000, Fidelity said.  In 2011 the median balance of accounts administered by
Vanguard Group Inc. was $25,550 and the average was $78,276,
according to  Linda Wolohan , a spokeswoman for the mutual-fund
manager based in  Valley Forge ,  Pennsylvania .  To contact the reporter on this story:
