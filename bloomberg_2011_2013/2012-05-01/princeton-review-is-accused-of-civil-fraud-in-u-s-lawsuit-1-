Princeton Review Inc. (REVU)  was sued for
civil fraud by the U.S., which said the test-preparation
provider repeatedly submitted false claims for reimbursement for
tutoring services.  The  Justice Department  filed the lawsuit today in Manhattan
federal court, claiming that Framingham, Massachusetts-based
Princeton Review received millions of dollars in federal funds
for tutoring services to New York City school children that it
didn’t provide.  “The company and certain of its employees forged student
signatures, falsified sign-in sheets and provided false
certifications in order to deceitfully profit from a well-
meaning program,” U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a
statement.  The scheme is alleged to have run from 2006 to 2010. The
complaint seeks triple damages and civil penalties.  A telephone call to the company seeking comment on the
lawsuit wasn’t immediately returned.  The case is U.S. v. Princeton Review, 12-cv-6876, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
