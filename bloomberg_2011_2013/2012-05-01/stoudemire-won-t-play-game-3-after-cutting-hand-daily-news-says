Amar’e Stoudemire won’t play for the
 New York  Knicks tomorrow and is doubtful for Game 4 after
cutting his left hand while punching a fire extinguisher
following a second straight playoff defeat by the  Miami Heat .  Stoudemire, New York’s second-leading scorer, had a small
muscle in his hand surgically repaired yesterday, the Knicks
said in an e-mailed statement.  Stoudemire, 29, cut his hand when he punched a metal and
glass box holding the extinguisher at Miami’s AmericanAirlines
Arena after the Knicks fell behind 2-0 in the best-of-seven
National Basketball Association series.  “Without him, it’s going to make it more difficult,”
Knicks center  Tyson Chandler  told reporters in the locker room
after Game 2. “It’s tough. Your emotions run high and split-
second decisions can alter things.”  The Knicks host Game 3 at Madison Square Garden in New York
tomorrow night, with Game 4 there three days later.  The Knicks have tied an NBA record with 12 straight playoff
losses dating to the 2000-01 postseason.  Stoudemire, who scored 18 points in Game 2, apologized on
his Twitter account last night.  “We all have done things out of anger that we regret,”
Stoudemire wrote. “That makes us human. Bad timing on my part.
Sorry guys.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
