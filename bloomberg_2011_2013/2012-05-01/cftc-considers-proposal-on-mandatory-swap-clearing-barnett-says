The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the main U.S. derivatives regulator, may propose
within months which swaps must be guaranteed by central
clearinghouses, said  Gary Barnett , the agency’s director of swap
dealer and intermediary oversight.  The CFTC may seek comment about which types of swaps will
face the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act’s clearing mandate that is designed
to reduce risk in the $708 trillion global market, Barnett said
at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc.’s
annual meeting in  Chicago .  “We hope that in the next couple of months we will move in
that direction,” Barnett said. Clearinghouses seek to reduce
risk in swaps by accepting margin, or collateral, from trading
parties in the transactions.  Dodd-Frank was enacted after largely unregulated swaps
helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
