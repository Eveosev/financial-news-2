German labor union Ver.di said warning
strikes linked to pay disputes with  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) â€™s T-
Systems and Telekom Deutschland units will continue this week.  Ver.di will call on 5,000 employees at the two units to
stop work tomorrow, with a similar amount of people expected to
take part in similar strikes on May 3 and May 4, Ver.di said in
an e-mailed statement today.  Negotiations on behalf of the 18,500 employees of T-Systems
will resume on May 2, while a union decision on how to proceed
with talks about pay at Telekom Deutschland will be taken the
following day, Ver.di said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
