Thailand  is “not likely” to stop
imports of U.S. beef at this time, the U.S. Meat Export
Federation said, reversing comments the trade group made
yesterday following last week’s case of mad cow disease.  “There’s a good chance Thailand will stay open,” Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the Denver-based group, said in a
telephone interview. “We don’t think that market will close. It
just appears that whatever thoughts they had about closing
appear to have subsided at this time.”  While Thailand never had any government-to-government
communication with the U.S. about a possible closure, there were
some “pretty strong signals” before today that new limits
might be imposed, Schuele said. The federation wanted to “err
on the side of caution,” which is why it decided to let people
know about the possibility of a ban, he said.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on April 24 that a
dairy cow in  California  was infected with mad cow disease,
Thailand bought less than 0.1 percent of total U.S. beef exports
in 2011. Thailand already limits U.S. imports to boneless beef
from cattle under 30 months of age, Schuele said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
