The National Oil Co. of Liberia will
hold talks with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and Canadian Overseas
Petroleum Ltd. after it approved in principle a plan that would
see Exxon take 70 percent control of an offshore oil block.  “Nocal looks forward to working with Exxon Mobil and COPL
to conclude a fair contractual agreement and bring the saga of
Block 13 to a satisfactory conclusion,” Randolph A.K.W.
McClain, president and chief executive officer of the Liberian
company, said in a  statement  published yesterday on its website.  The proposed deal will see the current owners of the block,
Isle of Man-registered Peppercoast Petroleum Plc, transfer its
100 percent interest to a unit of Calgary-based  Canadian
Overseas (XOP) , known as COPL.  Exxon will immediately get a 70 percent stake from COPL,
according to the statement from Nocal, as the Liberian company
is known.  The talks will take place in  London  next week and include
McClain, as well as Liberia’s ministers of justice, finance and
lands, mines and energy, according to Nocal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
