German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler plans to accelerate expansion of the country’s power
grid by making the planning process easier and speedier,  Die
Welt  reported, citing an interview with Roesler.  It’s crucial that the industry invests in grid expansion
and in construction of new plants, and the government will have
talks with the European Commission on how European regulation
can be adjusted to allow for that, the newspaper cited Roesler
as saying.  Germany  is withdrawing from nuclear energy in favor of
solar and wind power, as well as new fossil-fuel plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
