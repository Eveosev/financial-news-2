TD Securities, the investment-banking
unit of  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , hired Joseph Craven and Andrew
Trott to bolster foreign-exchange operations in Asia and Europe.  Craven, most recently a managing director at  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) , will run TD Securities’  foreign-exchange  sales
and trading business for the Asia-Pacific region in Singapore,
TD Securities said in a statement. Trott, who was a director on
the FX desk at RBC Capital Markets, will be vice president and
director of currency sales and trading in London.  “These two hires continue to strengthen our global FX
franchise business,” said Wojtek Dabrowski, spokesman for the
Toronto-based company, which is Canada’s second-largest bank.  It’s the second time in a month that Toronto-Dominion, one
of four lenders worldwide with a long-term debt  rating  of Aaa
from Moody’s Investors Service, has lured foreign-exchange
specialists from a rival global investment bank. In April, the
firm hired former  Morgan Stanley (MS)  bankers Glenn Juhlin and Paul
Aston for its New York office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
