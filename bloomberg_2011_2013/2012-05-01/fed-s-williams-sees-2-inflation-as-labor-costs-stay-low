Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
President  John Williams  said he expects inflation to remain
around the central bank’s goal of 2 percent as labor costs are
“muted” given the high  unemployment rate .  “Inflation expectations are well-anchored,” Williams said
today on a panel in Beverly Hills, California. “We’ve done a
pretty good job at keeping inflation low and relatively
stable.”  Williams, who votes on the policy-setting Federal Open
Market Committee this year, said the central bank will tighten
monetary policy if inflation risks rise, though he doesn’t
expect that to happen “for quite some time.”  “We know what to do,” Williams said. “We are very
committed to making sure that our policies keep inflation low
and stable.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
