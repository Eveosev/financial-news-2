Denmark’s manufacturing industry
expanded at the fastest pace since April last year as new orders
jumped and production soared, signaling the Nordic economy may
be emerging from its recession.  The purchasing managers’ index surged to 61.8 from a
revised 53, the Danish Purchasing and Logistics Forum said in a
report today. The sub-index measuring new orders rose to 66.3
from 59.3, while the production gauge increased to 66.6 from
61.5, the forum said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
