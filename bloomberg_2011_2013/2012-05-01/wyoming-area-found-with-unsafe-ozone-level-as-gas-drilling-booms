Wyoming ’s southwestern region was
found to have an unsafe level of smog-causing ozone, a
designation the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency linked to a
boom in oil and gas drilling in the state.  The EPA included the Upper Green River Basin in its list of
areas nationwide exceeding an ozone standard set in 2008 during
the administration of President  George W. Bush . Wyoming until
today was the only state where all counties had met the federal
ozone limit.  “It’s undoubtedly the oil and gas drilling going on out
there,”  John Walke , clean-air director for the New York-based
Natural Resources Defense Council, said in an interview. Walke
criticized President Barack Obama for throwing out a proposal by
the EPA to lower that ozone standard.  Ozone, a precursor to smog, is caused by emissions from
vehicle traffic, industrial activities or related projects such
as  road construction . Gas escaping from wells or pipelines
contains volatile organic compounds, which also can cause smog.  Breathing air containing high levels of ozone can reduce
lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, aggravating
asthma or other respiratory conditions, according to the EPA.  With the official designation of “non-attainment” for the
U.S. ozone standard of less than 75 parts per billion, a state
or locality must develop a plan to cut its pollution.  To contact the reporters on this story:
