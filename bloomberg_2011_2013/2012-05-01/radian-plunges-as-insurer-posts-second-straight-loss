Radian Group Inc. (RDN) , the insurer of U.S.
mortgages, fell the most since February after reporting a second
straight quarterly loss.  Radian plunged 7.4 percent to close at $2.89 in New York.
The Philadelphia-based firm’s shares gained 33 percent this year
through yesterday.  The insurer posted a first-quarter net loss of $169.2
million, or $1.28 a share, compared with a profit of $103
million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier, the firm said
today in a statement. That missed by 43 cents the average
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Mortgage
insurers pay lenders when homeowners default and foreclosures
fail to recoup costs.  “Financial results for the quarter continue to reflect the
challenges of the macroeconomic environment and our legacy
portfolio,” Chief Executive Officer S.A. Ibrahim said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
