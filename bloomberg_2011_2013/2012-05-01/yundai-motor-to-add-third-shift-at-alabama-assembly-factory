Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s
largest automaker, will add a third shift at its main assembly
plant in Montgomery, Alabama to meet rising demand for its
vehicles in the U.S.  Capacity at the factory, currently able to build at least
300,000 vehicles a year, will increase by 20,000 units after the
increase in shifts that begins in September, the company said
today in an e-mailed statement. The added shift will result in
877 extra workers, raising employment there to more than 3,000,
the Seoul-based carmaker said.  Hyundai’s first-quarter U.S. sales rose 15 percent, after
surging 61 percent the previous four years, helped by sales of
the Elantra and Sonata sedans.  John Krafcik , chief executive
officer of Hyundai’s U.S. sales unit, has said growth will cool
this year because of tight plant capacity.  The Alabama factory built a record 338,000 Sonata sedans
and Elantra compact cars last year, and plans to make at least
325,000 vehicles this year, Robert Burns, a spokesman for the
plant, said today. The factory has operated two 10-hour shifts
for about two years and frequent weekend overtime work.  Hyundai’s U.S. sales unit is in Costa Mesa,  California .  To contact the reporters on this story:
