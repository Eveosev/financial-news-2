Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  reported an
unexpected first-quarter loss, cut cash flow estimates, reduced
its drilling budget and said it may run out of money next year
under the weight of the lowest natural-gas prices in a decade.  Chesapeake’s net loss narrowed to $71 million, or 11 cents
a share, from $205 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier, the
Oklahoma City-based company said in a statement today. Excluding
one-time costs such as a net unrealized non-cash loss on hedging
contracts, per-share profit was 10 cents below the average of 34
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company slashed its full-year 2012 and 2013 operating
cash flow estimates by as much as 48 percent, and increased the
amount of assets it plans to sell. This year’s  cash flow 
estimate was lowered to $2.7 billion to $3 billion, from a
February forecast of $4.5 billion to $5.2 billion.  Chesapeake 2013 cash flow will be $4.4 billion to $5.3
billion, down from the previous estimate of $7.5 billion to $8.5
billion.  The company now is targeting asset sales of as much as
$20.5 billion by the end of 2013, compared with an earlier
top estimate of $17.5 billion.  Chesapeake raised production of oil and natural-gas liquids
such as propane by 71 percent during the quarter to 113,560
barrels a day, the statement said. Natural-gas production of
2.98 billion cubic feet a day was 10 percent higher than a year
earlier.  Perk Eliminated  During February and March, the company curtailed 54 billion
cubic feet of gas output, or the equivalent of 900 million cubic
feet a day. That fell short of the 1 billion-cubic-feet a day
reduction target announced on Jan. 23.  The statement was released after the close of regular U.S.
stock trading. Chesapeake fell 6 percent at 5:26 p.m. in after-
hours trading.  Before first-quarter results were announced, the shares
jumped 6.3 percent after the company announced plans to strip
Chief Executive Officer  Aubrey McClendon  of the chairman’s job
and end an executive perk that allowed him to buy personal
stakes in every well the company drilled.  McClendon’s plans to slash debt and return Chesapeake to
investment-grade ratings were overshadowed by news reports that
he borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars against personal
stakes in company wells.  The company began curtailing some gas output in January and
focusing investments on oilfields to produce more crude, which
trades for eight times more than gas, on an energy-equivalent
basis.  (Chesapeake scheduled a conference call to discuss first-
quarter results at 9 a.m.  New York  time tomorrow. To access the
