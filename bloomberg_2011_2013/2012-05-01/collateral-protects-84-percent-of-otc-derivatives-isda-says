The percentage of private derivatives
trades protected by collateral in the $708 trillion market rose
to 84 percent, according to the  International Swaps and
Derivatives Association .  That’s up from 80 percent of trades that were backed by
cash or other assets in last year’s study, New York-based ISDA
said in a  statement  today. About $3.6 trillion in collateral
backed trades in the market at the end of 2011, up from $2.9
trillion a year earlier, ISDA said.  “As the survey clearly demonstrates, collateralization
remains among the most widely used methods to mitigate
counterparty credit risk in the OTC derivatives market,”  Robert Pickel , chief executive officer of ISDA, said in the statement.  About 76 percent of the collateral is in cash, with the
remainder in  government securities  or other assets, ISDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
