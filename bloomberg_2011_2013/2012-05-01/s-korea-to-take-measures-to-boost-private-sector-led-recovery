South Korea  will carry out policy
measures that will encourage a private sector-led economic
recovery and allow the country to cope with external risks for
the rest of this year, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The outlook for Asia’s fourth-largest economy is still
uncertain due to Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and China’s
economic slowdown, the ministry said in a statement today. Price
pressures are persistent amid elevated oil prices and inflation
expectations, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
