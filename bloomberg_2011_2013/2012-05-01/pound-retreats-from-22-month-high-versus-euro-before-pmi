The pound weakened for a second day
against the dollar after an industry report showed U.K.
manufacturing growth slowed more than economists forecast,
reducing demand for Britain’s assets.  Sterling fell versus most of its 16 major counterparts as
the  Purchasing Managers ’ Index survey followed data last week
showing the U.K. economy slipped back into a recession last
quarter. The pound extended losses versus the greenback after
U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly expanded in April at the fastest
pace in 10 months. Gilts were little changed as the government
sold 3.75 billion pounds ($6.1 billion) of seven-year notes.  “The PMI data clearly weighed on sterling,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in
 London . “There’s some clear profit-taking in sterling, as it’s
come a long way against both the euro and dollar.”  The pound dropped 0.1 percent to $1.6221 at 4:28 p.m.
London time after climbing to $1.6302 yesterday, the highest
level since Aug. 31. Sterling was little changed at 81.52 pence
per euro after falling as much as 0.5 percent.  The index of U.K.  factory output , based on a survey by
 Markit Economics  and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply , fell to 50.5 last month from a revised 51.9 in March.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted a decline to
51.5. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  The U.K. economy unexpectedly shrank in the first three
months of the year, according to data published April 25,
pushing the nation into its first  double-dip recession  since the
1970s. Gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent from the fourth
quarter of 2011, when it declined 0.3 percent, the  Office for
National Statistics  said.  ‘Very Anxious’  A gauge of  services  activity based on a survey of
purchasing managers will drop to 54.1 for April from 55.3 in
March, according to the  median estimate  of economists before the
May 3 report.  “The market will be very anxious to see the PMI services
report,” Rabobank’s Foley said. “Lots of people are skeptical
about last week’s GDP numbers. As long as these numbers leave
scope for economists to question the depth of the bad GDP data,
then sterling will see buyers at lower levels.”  The pound has gained 1.4 percent in the past month, the
third-best performer after the yen and Canadian dollar of 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The dollar was little changed, and the euro
dropped 1.1 percent.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
climbed to 54.8 from 53.4, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s
report showed today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
was for a drop to 53.  ‘Small Pullback’  The pound is poised to consolidate against the dollar,
Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  “We would allow for a small pullback,”  Karen Jones , head
of fixed-income, commodity and currency technical analysis in
London, wrote in a note to clients. “There is scope for
$1.6110-$1.6050 ahead of further gains.”  Those levels represent the 38.2 percent and 50 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the pound’s rally since the start of
April, Jones said. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory
prices rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a new
high or low.  The Debt Management Office sold gilts maturing in March
2019 at an average yield of 1.495 percent. Investors bid for
1.79 times the amount allotted.  The  10-year gilt  yield was at 2.11 percent. The 4 percent
bond due in March 2022 traded at 116.77 percent of face value.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.3 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  U.S.
Treasuries  rose 0.2 percent and German bunds gained 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
