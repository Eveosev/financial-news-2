James Gutman resigned from Armajaro
Asset Management LLP, an arm of Armajaro Holdings Ltd. that
oversees investment funds.  The resignation took place yesterday, according to a filing
with the U.K.’s Companies House. A representative of London-
based Armajaro confirmed Gutman, who was a partner at the asset-
management arm, resigned from the company. Armajaro Holdings
hired Gutman from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in 2008 for the
Armajaro Commodities Fund.  Gutman was previously executive director and senior
economist in global investment research at Goldman Sachs. The
fund, which trades raw materials from precious metals to energy,
has $1.5 billion under management. It fell 7.1 percent last
year, according to Bloomberg  data .  To contact the reporters on this story:
