Ecopetrol SA (EC) , Colombia’s largest oil
company, gained the most in eight months in  New York  trading
after saying first-quarter profit rose 37 percent.  Ecopetrol’s American depositary receipts gained 4.3 percent
to $67.48 at the close, the steepest one-day gain since Aug. 29.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 index advanced 0.6 percent. Colombian
markets were closed for a holiday.  Profit climbed to 4.27 trillion pesos ($2.42 billion) from
3.11 trillion pesos a year earlier, the Bogota-based company
said in a  filing  to Colombia’s financial regulator after markets
closed yesterday.  Higher prices for Colombian heavy crude helped offset
modest production setbacks from pipeline attacks during the
quarter, Nathan Piper, an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets , wrote
in a report today.  “Production growth in the quarter was impacted by attacks
on the Cano Limon and OTA pipelines,” Piper wrote. He noted
that the Rubiales and Quifa fields continue to display “strong
performance.”  Production rose to 743,400 barrels a day of equivalent oil
and natural gas in the quarter from 686,300 barrels a year
earlier and 741,700 barrels a day in the fourth quarter,
according to  Ecopetrol (ECOPETL) ’s filing. Chief Executive Officer Javier Gutierrez said in March that guerrilla attacks won’t derail
plans to increase production this year to 800,000 barrels of oil
and natural gas a day.  Ecopetrol’s Bogota-traded shares have climbed 35 percent
this year, outpacing a 20 percent gain in the benchmark  IGBC
index. (IGBC)   To contact the reporter on this story:
