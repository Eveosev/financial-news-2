Asia’s benchmark  stock  index fell,
paring yesterday’s advance, as Japanese companies forecast
lower-than-estimated earnings and as the outlook for exporters
dimmed after a report signaled U.S. manufacturing is slowing.  Tokyo Electron Ltd., which sells industrial electronics
products, sank 8.3 percent after its earnings estimate trailed
analysts’ projections.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of
consumer electronics, lost 3.9 percent as the yen gained against
the dollar to the highest level since February. Commonwealth
Bank of  Australia  rose 1.7 percent as the nation’s central bank
cut interest rates to spur growth.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.7 percent to 124.49 as
of 3:14 p.m. in Tokyo with more than two stocks falling for each
that rose. Japan and Australia were the only major markets
traded today in Asia, with markets closed in  Hong Kong ,  China ,
India and South Korea.  “Investors can’t get optimistic about the Japanese
economy,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank
Ltd. in  Tokyo , a unit of Japan’s fifth-biggest lender by market
value. “The number of companies where earnings are improving as
much as investors’ expectations is relatively small.”  The Asia-Pacific index fell 2.8 percent in March and April
amid concern Europe will be trapped in a recession with debt-
stricken nations such as Spain cut spending, and as Chinese
economic growth slows.  Yen, BOJ  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.8 percent after the
yen touched 79.68 per dollar today, matching the strongest level
since Feb. 22, showing that the Bank of Japan’s additional
stimulus on April 27 isn’t weakening the currency. A stronger
yen cuts the value of overseas earnings at Japanese exporters.
Japan’s markets will be closed on May 3 and 4 for public
holidays.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.8 percent after the  Reserve
Bank  of Australia today cut its benchmark  interest rate  by a
half percentage point to a two-year-low 3.75 percent.  Financial shares contributed the most to the gauge’s
advance. Commonwealth Bank of Australia added 1.7 percent to
A$52.85.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s No. 2 lender by
market value, advanced 0.4 percent to A$22.83. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Excluding Japan Index was little changed.  “Aussie equities have been lagging for a while on the
tight monetary policy, so it needed to be loosened,”said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based strategist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.,
which manages almost $100 billion. “Given the weakness that
we’ve seen across the board in manufacturing and retail, a
quarter-point cut wasn’t going to be enough. They have done the
right thing.”  Japanese Profits  Tokyo Electron, the world’s second-biggest maker of
semiconductor production equipment, fell 8.3 percent to 4,085
yen, the lowest level since February 8, after predicting profit
will drop 18 percent this fiscal year.  Yamada Denki Co., an operator of consumer electronics
stores, slumped 10 percent to 4,665 yen after reporting an
operating profit of 88.9 billion yen ($1.1 billion), missing
analyst estimates of 112 billion yen.  Sharp Corp., Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal
displays, dropped 9.3 percent to 468 yen after forecasting a
wider-than-expected full-year net loss.  Of 375 companies listed on the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  that
have reported earnings since April 10, about 42 percent missed
analysts estimates and 45 percent beat them.  Manufacturing Slows  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The index slid 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday, when
the  Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc.  said its
business activity barometer dropped to 56.2 in April, showing
manufacturing is cooling. Readings greater than 50 signal
growth.  Companies that do business in the U.S. fell. Sony dropped
3.9 percent to 1,265 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s second-
largest carmaker by market value that generates 44 percent of
its sales in  North America , declined 3.4 percent to 2,799 yen.  “As expectations ratchet up and data can’t support those
high expectations, we start to get pessimistic again,” said
 Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment strategist for the
Asia-Pacific region at Russell Investment Group, which manages
about $150 billion. “Having seen a big rally in stocks in the
March quarter, we are back to more neutral positioning.
Valuation support isn’t there as strongly as before.”  Spain in Recession  Stocks also fell after a government report yesterday showed
 Spain ’s economy shrank 0.3 percent in the first quarter,
matching the contraction in the previous three months.  Asian stocks held on to losses even after Chinese
government report today showed the Purchasing Managers’ Index
rose to 53.3 in April from 53.1 in March.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 10.1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 11.2 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 5.2 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at  12.8 times  estimated
earnings on average, compared with a multiple of 13.3 for the
S&P 500 and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 1.4 percent to 20.81,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on the
Nikkei 225 was 6.5 percent below its 30-day average, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
