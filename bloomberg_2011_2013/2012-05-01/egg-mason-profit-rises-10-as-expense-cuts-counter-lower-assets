Legg Mason Inc. (LM) , the Baltimore-based
 money manager  with 18 straight quarters of redemptions, said
fiscal fourth-quarter profit increased 10 percent as expense
cuts offset the impact of lower stock and bond assets.  Net income  rose to $76.1 million, or 54 cents a share, in
the three months ended March 31, from $69 million, or 45 cents,
a year earlier, the firm said today in a statement. Fifteen
analysts in a Bloomberg survey had expected earnings of 47 cents
per share, excluding some costs. Clients pulled $4.9 billion
from Legg Mason funds, compared with $1.3 billion during the
prior quarter.  Chief Executive Officer  Mark Fetting  has cut jobs to
increase profitability and sought to improve performance at fund
units as he tries to end redemptions that started after returns
lagged behind those of peers in 2007 and 2008. Legg Mason has
completed a plan designed to save $130 million to $150 million
per year through a combination of job cuts and moving certain
technology functions to investment units.  “They’re at the tail end of their restructuring so they’re
starting to see some benefits from that,” Macrae Sykes, an
analyst with Gabelli & Co. in Rye,  New York , said in a telephone
interview today.  Legg Mason’s shares fell 2.9 percent to close at an almost
four-month low of $25.32 in New York. The  stock  has declined 32
percent in the past 12 months, compared with the 8.3 percent
drop in the Standard & Poor’s 20-company index of custody banks
and asset managers.  Expenses Fell  Expenses fell 6.2 percent from a year earlier to $576
million as Legg Mason completed its restructuring plan. Costs
from that plan fell to $1.9 million in the quarter, compared to
$15.7 million a year earlier.  “Streamlining is in the rear-view mirror, but continued
vigilance against cost and improving margin is still a
priority,” Fetting said today during a conference call with
analysts and investors. “We want to do that by really focusing
and growing and leveraging the investments that we have at
hand.”  Revenue earned for managing investor funds dropped 9.1
percent to $649 million, as advisory fees and performance fees
for beating certain benchmarks fell from a year earlier. Legg
Mason boosted its dividend 38 percent to 11 cents a share.  Legg Mason’s Redemptions  The firm’s assets declined 5.1 percent from a year earlier
to $643.3 billion. Stock assets, which generally earn higher
fees than fixed-income funds, decreased 14 percent to $163.4
billion in the year ended March 31. Bond assets, managed mostly
by the Western Asset Management unit, fell 0.1 percent to $356.1
billion and money funds declined 5.8 percent to $123.8 billion,
the firm said.  Legg Mason’s investors pulled $2.8 billion from bond funds
and $4.9 billion from stocks during the quarter. They deposited
$2.8 billion into Legg Mason’s money funds.  Investors will return to equities because of “less
appealing returns” in fixed income and more consistent positive
stock performance, Fetting said in a telephone interview.  Legg
Mason Capital Management , the value-oriented stock unit that’s
home to  Bill Miller , saw redemptions slow during the quarter, he
said.  Assets at the firm rose 2.6 percent from the previous
quarter as rising equity markets countered the impact of those
redemptions. The  MSCI ACWI Index (MXWD)  of global stocks increased
about 11 percent this year through March and the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  gained 12 percent.  Miller Steps Down  Legg Mason’sMiller, famous for beating the S&P 500 Index
for a record 15 years through 2005, stepped down yesterday as
manager of Legg Mason Capital Management Value Trust after
trailing the index in four out of five years since 2005. The
fund, which has declined at an average annual pace of 8.3
percent over the past five years to rank at the bottom of its
group, has advanced 12 percent this year to beat 69 percent of
similarly managed funds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sam Peters  has taken over as manager of the $2.5
billion fund.  Investors pulled about $8.6 billion from U.S.-registered
equity funds industrywide in the first quarter of this year,
while depositing about $95 billion into bond funds, according to
the  Investment Company Institute , a Washington-based trade
association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
