The U.K. enlisted Jeff Chapman, head
of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, to lead a panel
that will seek ways to cut the cost of the technology.  The Carbon Capture and Storage Cost Reduction Task Force
will advise government and industry on how to make trapping and
burying of emissions competitive with other methods of curbing
greenhouse gas emissions by the early 2020s, the Department of
Energy and Climate Change said today in an e-mailed statement.  Chapman set up the Carbon Capture and Storage Association
industry group in 2006, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
