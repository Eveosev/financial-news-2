Oil climbed to a five-week high after
U.S. manufacturing increased at the fastest pace in 10 months,
signaling that economic growth will accelerate in the world’s
biggest crude-consuming country.  Futures gained 1.2 percent as the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s  factory index  exceeded the most optimistic forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Prices have fallen 4
percent from a March 1 peak as tensions have eased between Iran
and Western nations over the country’s nuclear program.  “The reaction to the ISM shows that the market is much
more focused on the state of the economy than the situation with
Iran,” said  David Greely , head of energy research at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in New York. “This is the first surprise we’ve
had to the upside in quite a while.”  Crude oil for June delivery gained $1.29 to $106.16 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement price since March 27. Oil has climbed 7.4 percent
this year.  Prices were little changed after Washington-based industry
group  American Petroleum Institute  said U.S.  oil inventories 
rose 2.04 million barrels to 370.4 million last week, the
highest level since May 27, 2011. The June contract gained
$1.10, or 1 percent, to $105.97 in electronic trading at 4:34
p.m.  Brent oil for June settlement rose 19 cents to end the
session at $119.66 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Brent’s  premium  to West Texas Intermediate
traded on the Nymex narrowed to $13.50, the smallest spread
since Jan. 31.  The ISM index expanded to 54.8 in April from 53.4 in March.
The median forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for a drop to 53. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  Signals Growth  “We had really good ISM manufacturing data,” said Phil Streible, a Chicago-based commodities broker at RJO Futures.
“It exceeded expectations and signaled growth in the U.S.
That’s going to help oil demand.”  The ISM report eased concern that manufacturing is slowing
after data from the Federal Reserve Bank of  Dallas  trailed
estimates yesterday.  The Labor Department will release April employment data on
May 4. Payrolls climbed by 161,000 workers after a 120,000 gain
in March, according to the median forecast of 80 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg before the report. The jobless rate stayed
at 8.2 percent, the survey showed.  “The ISM is important but the jobs report later this week
will be of greater importance,” said  Mike Wittner , head of oil
market research at Societe Generale SA in New York. “It was
jobs report a month ago that triggered the correction in prices
during much of April.”  China Manufacturing  Also boosting oil,  China ’s manufacturing expanded for a
fifth month in April. The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to
53.3 from 53.1 in March, the country’s statistics bureau and
logistics federation said in a statement today. That’s the
highest reading in a year.  The U.S. and China are the world’s biggest oil consumers.
Total fuel demand in the U.S. fell 0.6 percent to 18.8 million
barrels a day in the week ended April 20, according to the
Energy Department.  U.S. stocks also moved higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index gained 0.6 percent.  “The equity market is contributing to the gain” in oil,
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market broke the $105 resistance
level and this has triggered some technical buying.”  Inventory Report  An Energy Department report tomorrow will probably show
that U.S. crude stockpiles rose  2.5 million barrels  last week to
375.5 million, according to the median of 11 analyst projections
in a Bloomberg survey.  The department is scheduled to release its weekly report at
10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 526,312
contracts as of 4:34 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 412,374
contracts yesterday, 34 percent below the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.58 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
