Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  said U.S. stocks offer good value and are likely to
rise as corporate earnings increase over time.  “Stocks are very cheap,” Greenspan said today at the
Bloomberg Washington Summit hosted by  Bloomberg Link , citing “a
very low price-earnings ratio.”  “There is no place for earnings to grow except into stock
prices,” said Greenspan, who served as Fed chairman from August
1987 to January 2006.  Stocks have rallied on better-than-forecast corporate
profits and signs of economic strength. The  Standard & Poor’s (SPX) 
500 Index has risen more than 12 percent this year, the best
start to a year since 1998.  The index rose 1.1 percent to 1,413.83 at 12:57 p.m. in  New
York  after a report showed that U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly
expanded in April at the fastest pace in 10 months.  The S&P 500  trades  for 14.3 times reported income from its
companies, or 13 percent  below  the average since 1954, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Another valuation metric, known as the Fed model because it
was derived from a July 1997 report from the central bank, shows
U.S. equities are close to the cheapest level ever relative to
debt. The technique compares the earnings yield for stocks with
Treasury rates.  Bull Market  Profit for S&P 500 companies has represented 7.2 percent of
the index’s price on average in 2012, or 5.91 percentage points
more than yields on 10-year Treasuries, according to Fed model
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the average
difference of 0.03 percentage point and the record high of 6.99
points when the  bull market  started in March 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1962.  Greenspan said the rising stock prices create a “wealth
effect” that boosts consumer spending and the overall economy.
“So equities play a hugely important role, which I think is
grossly underestimated,” he said.  In a separate interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene , Greenspan said a lack of
long-term investment in housing and nonresidential construction
was hurting employment.  “Housing at this stage as you know is moving nowhere,” he
said.  Market Balance  The former Fed leader, who opposed excessive financial
regulation as a central banker, said the best thing U.S. policy
makers can do is refrain from interventions that prevent markets
from settling to a proper balance.  “Allow markets to heal,” he said. “Markets have been
consistently bombarded with all sorts of policy decisions,”
which “has clearly prevented markets from adjusting.”  Treasury 10-year yields rose from almost the lowest level
in three months after the  Institute for Supply Management  said
its  factory index  climbed to 54.8 last month, exceeding the most
optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey, from 53.4 in March.
Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  The 10-year yield rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.95 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader pricing. It touched 1.90 percent before the manufacturing
report.  The former central banker’s comments on equities haven’t
always been timely. In 1996, Greenspan said the stock market may
reflect “irrational exuberance” when the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  was above 6400. The index peaked at over 11,700 in
January 2000, before technology stocks slumped.  To contact the reporters on this story:
