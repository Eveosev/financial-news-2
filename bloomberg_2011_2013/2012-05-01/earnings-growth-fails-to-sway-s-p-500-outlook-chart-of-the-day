U.S. companies are poised to repeat
their first-quarter success in exceeding analysts’ earnings
estimates, according to  Jonathan Golub , chief U.S. market
strategist at UBS AG.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, last week’s profit
projections for companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
amounted to a 1.6 percent increase, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The figure was unchanged from the end of March.  Estimated earnings growth for the first quarter climbed
during the period to 5.3 percent from 0.6 percent. The higher
percentage is based on results for about 60 percent of the S&P
500’s companies and estimates for the rest. Analysts expected
lower profits in February and March, as the chart depicts.  “It is quite clear that analysts have underestimated
first-quarter earnings strength,” Golub wrote yesterday in a
report. Their reluctance to lift numbers for this quarter “sets
the bar quite low” for the next wave of reports, the New York-
based strategist wrote.  Companies whose earnings are most affected by the pace of
economic growth are most likely to exceed estimates, the report
said. Golub singled out industrial, raw-material and technology
companies, along with automakers, retailers and others in the
consumer-discretionary category.  More than 80 percent of the S&P 500’s consumer-
discretionary and industrial companies surpassed analysts’
average first-quarter estimate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg through yesterday. The rate for S&P 500 companies as a
group was 71 percent, up three percentage points from a year
ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
