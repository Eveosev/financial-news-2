The cost of protecting Australian and
Japanese corporate bonds from default rose, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 3.5 basis
points to 157.5 basis points as of 10:55 a.m. in Sydney,
according to Deutsche Bank AG. The gauge was on course for its
biggest daily advance since April 16, according to CMA data.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index advanced 1.5 basis points to
182.5 as of 10:09 a.m. in  Tokyo  from its April 27 close,
Citigroup Inc. prices show. The measure has gained for seven
days, the longest string of increases since November, the data
show. Markets were closed yesterday in Japan for a public
holiday, and are shut in  Hong Kong  and Singapore today.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
