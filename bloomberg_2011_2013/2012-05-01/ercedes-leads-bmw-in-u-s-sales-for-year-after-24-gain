Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz regained
the U.S. luxury-vehicle sales lead for the year over  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW brand with April deliveries rising
24 percent, the biggest gain of any premium brand.  U.S. sales of Mercedes vehicles rose to 22,336 last month
while BMW deliveries increased 12 percent to 21,062, according
to statements yesterday by the companies.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s
Lexus brand, the top luxury seller for 11 years through 2010,
slipped 0.1 percent to 17,551.  Mercedes and BMW, which overtook Lexus last year to become
the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S., are competing for the
2012 sales crown. BMW, based in Munich, finished the first
quarter with a 36 vehicle lead over Mercedes.  April results lifted Mercedes sales for the year 17 percent
to 83,849, giving the Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker a 1,238
vehicle lead after four months over BMW, which had a sales
increase of 16 percent. Lexus deliveries rose 2.6 percent to
66,647 during the first four months of the year.  “I don’t see one of them pulling ahead dramatically,”
said  Jesse Toprak , an analyst with TrueCar.com, a website that
tracks auto sales. “You’re going to see this back-and-fourth
for the rest of the year.”  The results exclude Daimler’s Sprinter vans and Smart cars
and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  Mercedes sales were helped by deliveries of the updated
C-Class sedan, up 23 percent, and M-Class sport-utility vehicle,
up 54 percent, the Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker said in a
statement.  Global Fight  The BMW and Mercedes sales race extends beyond the U.S.
borders. The two are locked in a global battle along with
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi luxury brand.  Audi deliveries rose 15 percent in the U.S. last month to
11,521, the 16th consecutive month of record sales, the premium
brand of Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW, said in a statement. After
four months, Audi’s sales this year rose 16 percent to 40,991,
pushing it past  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac brand at 40,817.  Cadillac fell 25 percent to 9,851 in April as the luxury
brand suffered from the elimination of old models before new
ones reach dealers later this year. Cadillac sales slid
24 percent through April, the company said in a statement.  “The other luxury makes are being very aggressive in the
marketplace,” Kurt McNeil, Cadillac’s vice president in charge
of sales, said on a conference call yesterday. “Their incentive
spend is up anywhere from 10 to 50 percent.”  Acura, Porsche, Infiniti  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , based in  Tokyo , said in a statement that
sales for its Acura brand rose 4.9 percent to 12,175 last month.  Porsche AG (PAH3) , the Stuttgart-based automaker, sold 3,437
vehicles in the U.S., an 8.4 percent increase, the company said
in a statement.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s Infiniti sold 7,129 vehicles, a
5.4 percent gain from a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based
company, said in a statement.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 6,308 Lincolns in April, a 13 percent
decline from a year earlier, according to a statement from the
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Land Rover deliveries rose 10 percent to 3,292, while
Jaguar sales declined 14 percent to 1,073, the U.K. brands,
owned by Mumbai-based  Tata Motors Ltd (TTMT) , said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
