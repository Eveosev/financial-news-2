New York  gasoline gained against
futures after the  New York Mercantile Exchange ’s front-month
contract rolled from May into June.  The discount to June futures for conventional gasoline to
be blended with ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor was 7 cents
a gallon at 2:04 p.m. East Coast time compared with yesterday’s
8.25-cent discount to May futures, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell 5.72 cents to $3.0447 a gallon.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf Coast region
slipped 0.88 cent to 17.88 cents a gallon below futures, the
lowest level for the fuel since March 12.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  started a crude unit at the 170,000-
barrel-a-day McKee refinery in  Texas  that had been shut for
work,  Bill Day , a spokesman at the company’s headquarters in  San
Antonio , said in an e-mail today. The unit was started over the
weekend and is at planned rates, he said.  Valero’s 250,000-barrel-a-day St. Charles refinery started
the crude and coker units after more than three months of work,
Day said yesterday. The 310,000-barrel-a-day Port Arthur plant
also finished catalyst work on the hydrocracker that began March
27, he said.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Chicago  fell 2 cents to
a 2.5-cent discount against futures.  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting refinery in  Indiana  had a “pump issue”
yesterday that prevented it from shipping products over the West
Shore pipeline near Chicago, said Marty White, director of
right-of-way for the line’s operator  Buckeye Partners LP. (BPL)  The
artery connecting the plant to the line was expected to be
reopened today, he said in a telephone interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
