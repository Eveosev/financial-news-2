Gold fell for a second straight day as
signs of stronger U.S. industrial growth boosted prospects for
the economy and eroded the appeal of the precious metal as a
haven.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of equities rose as much as
1.2 percent after the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory
index rose to 54.8 in April from 53.4 in March. Economists had
forecast a reading of 53, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. The precious metal has gained 6.1 percent this
year as Europe’s intensifying debt crisis threatened global
growth.  “The ISM numbers gave investors a good reason to jump back
into equities,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a market strategist at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “People are favoring equities over gold.”  Gold futures for June delivery slid 0.1 percent to settle
at $1,662.40 an ounce at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices earlier reached $1,672.30, the highest since April 13.  Asian markets including  Hong Kong , South Korea,  China ,
India and Singapore are closed for public holidays. Most western
European markets, including Germany, France and Spain, are
closed for the May Day holiday.  Silver futures for July delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$30.93 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, palladium futures for
June delivery slipped 0.2 percent to $681.05 an ounce, snapping
a three-session rally. Platinum futures for July delivery rose
less than 0.1 percent to $1,572.30 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
