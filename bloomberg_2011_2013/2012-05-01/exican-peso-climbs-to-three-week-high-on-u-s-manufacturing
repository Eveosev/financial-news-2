Mexico ’s peso rose to a three-week
high after a report showing U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly
expanded in April bolstered optimism about economic growth in
the Latin American country’s top export market.  The peso gained 1 percent to 12.8886 at 11:31 a.m. New York
time, and earlier climbed to 12.8843, the strongest since April
6. Mexico’s currency has risen 8.1 percent this year, the most
among all of its 16 most-traded peers.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S.  factory index 
climbed to 54.8 last month, exceeding the most optimistic
forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Readings greater
than 50 signal growth.  “Even when U.S. data are mixed, the manufacturing sector
seems to be doing better than the rest,”  Benito Berber , a Latin
America strategist at Nomura Securities Inc., said in a
telephone interview. “Mexico benefits directly from an improved
U.S. manufacturing sector.”  Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  The peso was the best performer today among a basket of 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. There was no
trading of local bonds as the market was closed for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
