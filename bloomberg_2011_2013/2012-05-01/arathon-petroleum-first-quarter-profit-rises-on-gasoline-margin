Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) , the oil
refiner that’s weighing a spinoff of its pipeline division, said
first-quarter profit increased as refining margins widened.  Net income rose to $596 million, or $1.70 a share, from
$529 million, or $1.48, a year earlier, Findlay, Ohio-based
Marathon Petroleum said in a statement today issued by  Thomson
Reuters . Per-share profit was 39 cents more than the average of
13 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger is weighing an
initial public offering for some of the company’s 9,600 miles
(15,400 kilometers) of pipelines that run from the  Gulf Coast  to
the Midwest. The IPO could raise Marathon’s value by as much as
$6.2 billion, according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  Heminger announced plans to study the option Feb. 1, less
than two weeks after hedge fund Jana Partners LLC bought a 5.5
percent stake and began talks with the company. The company is
still mulling an IPO of a minority stake in its pipelines,
according to a separate statement today.  The earnings statement was released before the start of
regular trading in U.S. markets. Marathon Petroleum rose 0.8
percent to $41.61 yesterday in  New York  Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have 13 buy  ratings from analysts  and five
holds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
