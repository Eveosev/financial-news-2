Gregg Popovich was voted the  National
Basketball Association ’s Coach of the Year after leading the San
Antonio Spurs to a 50-16 record this season, tied with the
 Chicago Bulls  for the most wins in the league during the
lockout-shortened regular season.  It’s the second such award for Popovich, who is in his 16th
season in San Antonio and is the longest tenured coach with the
same team in the four major U.S. professional sports. He also
earned the honor in 2002-03.  Popovich received 77 of the 119 first-place votes from a
panel of North American sportswriters and broadcasters. Bulls
coach Tom Thibodeau finished second with 27 first-place votes.  San Antonio is in the postseason for the 15th straight year
under Popovich, the longest active streak in the NBA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
