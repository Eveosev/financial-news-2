U.S.  food-stamp  use, which Republicans
have cited as evidence of a failing economy, dropped 0.3 percent
in February from the previous month, the government said.  About 46.326 million Americans received aid, down from
46.45 million in January, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today in an e-mail. Participation was 4.8 percent higher
than a year earlier. February was the second consecutive monthly
drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
