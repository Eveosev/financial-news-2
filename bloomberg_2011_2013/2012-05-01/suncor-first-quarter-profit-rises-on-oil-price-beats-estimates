Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s
largest energy company by market value, said first-quarter
profit increased as it benefited from higher  oil prices .  Net income rose to C$1.46 billion ($1.48 billion), or 93
cents a share, from C$1.03 billion, 65 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said today in a statement on Market
Wire. That beat the 81-cent average of 18  analysts’ estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  West Texas crude, the U.S. benchmark, traded at an average
of $103.03 a barrel in  New York  during the first three months of
the year, 8.9 percent more than a year earlier.  Output dropped to the equivalent of 562,300 barrels a day,
compared with 601,300 a year earlier. Average daily oil-sands
production, the company’s main product, was 305,700 barrels a
day from 322,100 barrels a year earlier.  Suncor owns oil-sands operations in northern  Alberta , as
well as wind farms, a biofuel plant and offshore oil assets.  The earnings were announced after regular trading ended on
North American markets. The stock has 21 buy and three hold
ratings from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
