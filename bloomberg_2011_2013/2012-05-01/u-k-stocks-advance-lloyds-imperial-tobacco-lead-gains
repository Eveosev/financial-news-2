U.K. stocks  jumped the most in two
weeks after  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  reported profit that topped
analyst estimates and U.S. manufacturing expanded at the fastest
pace in 10 months.  Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, climbed 8.3
percent as first-quarter profit more than doubled.  Imperial
Tobacco (IMT)  Group Plc gained 3.7 percent as its earnings matched
projections.  Chemring Group Plc (CHG)  rallied the most in 13 years
after winning two orders.  BP Plc (BP/)  paced declining shares after
net income dropped 19 percent.  The FTSE 100 Index rose 74.45 or 1.3 percent, to 5,812.23
in  London , the largest gain since April 17. The gauge fell 0.5
percent last month as Britain slipped into a double-dip
recession and concerns grew that the euro-area debt crisis is
deepening. The FTSE All-Share Index surged 1.2 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index climbed 1.1 percent.  “The market has been assisted by a number of factors that
included a decent rally by bank stocks buoyed by better than
expected first quarter numbers from Lloyds,” said  Angus Campbell , head of market analysis at Capital Spreads in London.
We’ve also seen “strength from U.S. markets where the news flow
has been conducive to buying equities.”  Stocks extended gains today after U.S. data showed
manufacturing in the world’s largest economy expanded in April,
driven by gains in orders and production. The  Institute for
Supply Management ’s  factory index  climbed to 54.8, exceeding the
most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey, from 53.4 in
March. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  U.K. Manufacturing  In contrast, U.K. manufacturing grew at a slower rate than
economists forecast in April as new export orders declined at
the fastest pace since May 2009.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
 FTSE 100 (UKX)  today was 36 percent lower than the average of the last
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. All western
European markets, except the U.K., Ireland and  Denmark , were
closed for the May Day holiday.  Lloyds jumped 8.3 percent to 33.60 pence after pretax
profit, excluding one-time items and asset sales, more than
doubled to 628 million pounds ($1 billion). The median analyst
estimate was for a profit of 422 million pounds, according to  a
Bloomberg survey. Total impairments fell by 36 percent, helped
by the lender’s Irish and Australian units.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , which is scheduled to
report earnings on May 4, gained 4.2 percent to 25.3 pence.
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  rose 3.6 percent to 226.2 pence and HSBC Holdings
Plc increased 1.8 percent to 565 pence.  Imperial Tobacco  Imperial Tobacco  increased 3.7 percent to 2,556 pence after
Europe’s second-biggest tobacco company reported a 3 percent
increase in adjusted operating profit to 1.52 billion pounds in
the six months ended March 31, helped by higher prices for
cigarettes in the U.K. That equaled the median estimate of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chemring jumped 20 percent to 391.9 pence, the biggest gain
since February 1999. The defense manufacturer said it has now
received all five key orders for 2012, including a contract for
ground-penetrating radar for the U.S. Army.  BP retreated 0.8 percent to 441.3 pence.  Europe ’s second-
largest  oil company  reported a 19 percent decline in first-
quarter net income to $5.9 billion, as asset sales lowered
production and refining weakened.  Excluding one-time items and changes in inventories, profit
missed analyst forecasts. Oil and gas production, including
output from the Russian TNK-BP venture, was 3.45 million barrels
of oil equivalent a day.  Man Group Slides  Man Group tumbled 5.5 percent to 97.8 pence, retreating for
a second day. The world’s largest publicly traded hedge fund
manager said clients redeemed $4.1 billion in the first quarter.
The outflow was partly offset by $3.1 billion of sales. Assets
under management increased to $59 billion from $58.4 billion.  Man Group’s biggest hedge fund, the $21 billion AHL
computerized trading system, has lost 2.1 percent this year
after declining 6 percent in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The shares have retreated 23 percent this year.  Aer Lingus (AERL)  Group Plc gained 1.9 percent to 99.3 euro cents
in Dublin after Etihad Airways, the third-largest carrier in the
 Middle East , built up a 2.99 percent holding in the Irish
airline. The stake could be increased should the pair reach an
agreement on an alliance, Aer Lingus said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
