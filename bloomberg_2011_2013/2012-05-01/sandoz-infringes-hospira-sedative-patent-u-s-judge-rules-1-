The Sandoz unit of Swiss drugmaker
 Novartis AG (NOVN)  infringes a U.S. patent licensed by Hospira Inc. for
the sedative  Precedex , a federal judge in  New Jersey  decided.  Novartis was sued by Hospira in 2009 in Trenton, New
Jersey, over the intravenous medicine, used in surgery. U.S.
District Judge Mary L. Cooper decided the case yesterday,
according to electronic court records.  Cooper also ruled that  Lake Forest , Illinois-based
Hospira’s patent “is valid and enforceable,” and said another
Hospira patent in the lawsuit is invalid because the purported
invention would be obvious to an expert.  The judge also ordered that Sandoz’s planned generic
version of the drug can’t be introduced until the infringed
patent expires in 2013, according to court papers and U.S. Food
and Drug Administration records.  Julie Masow, a spokeswoman for Basel-based Novartis, didn’t
immediately return an e-mail message seeking comment on the
ruling. Hospira announced the decision in a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filing.  The case is  Hospira Inc. (HSP)  v. Sandoz International GmbH,
09CV4591, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton).  To see the infringed patent, click: 4,910,214.  To contact the reporter on this story:
