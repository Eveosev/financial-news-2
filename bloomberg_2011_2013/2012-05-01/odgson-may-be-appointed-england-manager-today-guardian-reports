Roy Hodgson  may be appointed as
England soccer manager today following four hours of talks with
the Football Association yesterday, the  Guardian reported .  Hodgson and his agent, Leon Angel, will continue
discussions with the F.A’s four-man appointment panel at
London’s Wembley Stadium today on a contract that will run
through at least the 2014  World Cup , the Guardian said.  Hodgson, 64, was granted permission by West Bromwich Albion
on April 29 to speak to English soccer’s governing body about
the post left vacant when Fabio Capello quit in February. The
F.A.  said two days ago  that Hodgson is the only person it has
approached.  Hodgson coached the national teams of Switzerland, Finland
and the United Arab Emirates as well as  Inter Milan  in Italy,
Malmo in Sweden, and English clubs Blackburn, Fulham and
Liverpool. He took over West Brom in February 2011 after being
fired by Liverpool.  Stuart Pearce , England’s under-21 manager, has overseen
training and an exhibition match since Capello’s departure.
England is preparing for the European Championship, which starts
June 8 in Poland and Ukraine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
