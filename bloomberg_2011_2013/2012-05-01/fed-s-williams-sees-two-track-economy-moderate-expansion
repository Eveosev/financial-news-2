President John C. Williams said he expects the economy to grow
at a “moderate” pace of 2.5 percent this year and “pick-up
somewhat” during the next few years.  “It’s going to take a while to build up momentum,” with
weakness in the housing market and reduced government spending
inhibiting growth, Williams said today on a panel at a
conference in Beverly Hills, California.  “We basically have this two-track economy,” with some
areas like manufacturing showing signs of strength while others,
such as construction, remain weak, said Williams, who votes on
the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
