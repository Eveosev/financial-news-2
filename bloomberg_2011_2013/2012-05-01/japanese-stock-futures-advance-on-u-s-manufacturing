Japanese and Australian stock futures
rose after manufacturing in the U.S. unexpectedly grew in April
at the fastest pace in 10 months, boosting the outlook for Asian
exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
consumer electronics exporter, rose 1.3 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of  Canon Inc. (7751) , Japan’s biggest
camera maker that depends on the Americas for 27 percent of
sales, gained 0.3 percent. Shares of  News Corp. (NWS)  may be active in
Sydney after a British parliamentary committee said Chairman
Rupert Murdoch is “not a fit person” to lead a major
international company.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,375 in Chicago yesterday, up from 9,340 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,390 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index advanced 0.5 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.3 percent in Wellington.  “There’s no doubt that this data is moving in the right
direction,” said Angus Gluskie, managing director at White
Funds Management in Sydney, who manages more than $350 million.
“It’s a good indication of the health of the  U.S. economy .”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index advanced 0.6 percent in  New York 
yesterday and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rallied 0.5
percent to close at the highest level since December 2007.  Manufacturing Expands  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index rose to
54.8 in April from 53.4 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s report showed yesterday. Readings greater than 50
signal manufacturing is expanding. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a drop to 53.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 9.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 11.8 percent gain by the S&P
500 and a 5.7 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with a multiple of 13.4 times for
the S&P 500 and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese equities in the U.S. advanced 1.1 percent to 104.65 in
New York, bringing its gain for this week to 0.4 percent.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
