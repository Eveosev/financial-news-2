Raw sugar delivered against the
expired May contract on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  was
estimated at 13,440 contracts, or about 682,783 metric tons, by
Santos, Brazil-based consultancy SA Commodities.  That would be bigger than a delivery of about 300,000 tons
that London-based broker Sucden Financial Ltd. estimated
yesterday and smaller than the 17,325 contracts, or 880,150
tons, delivered against the March contract.  One trade house is seen taking all the sugar, while three
others are expected to deliver the sweetener, Luiz Carlos dos
Santos Jr., head of sugar brokerage and operations at SA
Commodities, wrote in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Cargill Inc. was the sole receiver of sugar after the March
contract expired. Trading of May futures ended yesterday. ICE
Futures U.S. will publish the delivery notice today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
