Coffee-bean exports from  Indonesia ’s
southern Sumatra, the main growing area in the world’s third-
largest robusta producer, surged in April from a month earlier
due to increased supplies from plantations.  Overseas sales from Lampung, Bengkulu and South Sumatra
provinces, which grow mostly robusta, jumped 95 percent to 9,898
metric tons last month from March, according to data released
today by the Lampung trade and industry office. Sales were
23,247 tons in April last year.  Rising shipments from the Southeast Asian country may help
to halt a 9 percent rally this year in London on the price of
the bitter-tasting robusta variety used in instant drinks, amid
concern about fewer cargoes from  Vietnam , the largest producer.
 Brazil  is the second-biggest grower and Indonesia is third.  “Arrivals from plantations have started to increase and
they will continue to rise until the harvest reaches its peak in
June or July,” said Mochtar Luthfie, head of research and
development at the Lampung branch of the Association of
Indonesian Coffee Exporters and Industry.  Beans arrivals were estimated at about 4,500 tons last week,
Volcafe Ltd., the unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings
Ltd., said April 27.  The three provinces account for about 75 percent of
supplies from Indonesia. The beans were shipped from Panjang
port in Lampung.  July-delivery robusta futures fell 1.1 percent to $1,978 a
ton on the NYSE Liffe Exchange in  London  at 5:09 p.m. Jakarta
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
