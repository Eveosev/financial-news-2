Paul Farrelly, an opposition Labour
Party member of Parliament’s culture committee, said lawmakers
had been “led up the garden path” by  News Corp. (NWSA)  over the
phone-hacking scandal.   “More importantly, so were the readers of its papers, the
general public and the victims of phone hacking,” he told a
press conference in  London  today. “Rupert Murdoch, who founded
the organisation, has at all times been a director of News
International, and not just News Corp.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
