Roy Hodgson  was appointed as England
soccer manager six weeks before the team opens its European
Championship campaign against France.  The 64-year-old Englishman was hired on a four-year
contract following discussions with a Football Association panel
that included chairman David Bernstein and general secretary
Alex Horne. The former Switzerland national team manager
replaces Fabio Capello, who quit after disagreeing with F.A.’s
decision to remove the captaincy from  John Terry  in February.  Hodgson’s appointment, confirmed in an F.A. statement
today, comes as U.K. newspapers including the Sun question the
move after pushing for the appointment of Tottenham manager
Harry Redknapp, who was the favorite among bookmakers. The F.A.
said Hodgson, who’s coached Inter Milan and Liverpool as well as
the U.A.E. and  Finland , was the only person approached.  West Bromwich Albion, Hodgson’s current Premier League
club, gave him permission on April 29 to speak with the F.A.
about the England job. Following four hours of talks yesterday
Hodgson concluded discussions today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
