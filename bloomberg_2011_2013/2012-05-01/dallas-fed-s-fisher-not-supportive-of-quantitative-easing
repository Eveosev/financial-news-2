President  Richard Fisher  said he’s not supportive of another
round of quantitative easing. He also said Congress remains the
biggest risk to the  U.S. economy .  “No amount of monetary accommodation will make up for this
problem of not dealing with this fiscal cliff,” Fisher said in
an interview from Los Angeles played today on BNN Television in
Canada.  He said Europe’s fiscal and economic issues are a lesson
for the U.S.  “Monetary policy alone cannot solve problems without
proper fiscal policy,” Fisher said. “If we let it go too far
as the Greeks obviously did, we’ll end up with riots in the
streets in the United States.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
