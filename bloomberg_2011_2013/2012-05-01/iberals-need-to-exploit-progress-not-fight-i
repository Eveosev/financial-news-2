Last week I argued that accelerating
economic change driven by  globalization  and information
technology ought to make conservatives in the U.S. and  Europe 
rethink some of their ideas. The same goes for liberals.  This economic transformation has two important features.
One is faster obsolescence of many job-specific skills. In the
future, fewer careers will be lifelong. People will need to be
more adaptable and protect themselves better against economic
risk. The other is widening  income inequality , a trend that’s
already apparent. Globalization and IT are amping up the  winner-
takes-all  aspect of the modern economy. Those who do well will
do very well; many of the rest, if they prosper at all, will see
that they’re falling further behind.  Risk and inequality are themes, of course, that liberals
already emphasize. The Great Recession has pushed the left’s
favorite topics up the political agenda. The point is, this
shift isn’t temporary. These issues won’t subside even as the
industrial economies start to grow faster, because faster growth
will go hand in hand with greater risk and further widening of
the gap between rich and poor.  So liberals have the right concerns. It’s their
prescriptions that need work.  Affordability Matters  Effective safety nets will be more, not less, important.
They also need to be affordable, something that many on the left
prefer not to think about. In the U.S., ignorance of that
challenge is a little easier to defend than in Europe. Taxes are
low by international standards. The country can still talk about
how much more tax the winners should pay. In most of Europe,
much as the left may wish to deny it, there’s less scope for
debate. In some countries, the various tiers of government
already consume roughly half of national income. Europe is
testing the limits of the  tax power .  Meanwhile, again in Europe more than in the U.S.,
demographic change is raising the ratio of retirees to workers
and will put  heavy new burdens  on taxpayers. As these pressures
mount, ignoring affordability is the surest way to jeopardize
state-funded pensions and other safety-net programs.  There are good and bad ways to shore up the programs’
finances. Overall caps on benefits so that they grow at less
than the rate of inflation are a bad way. That merely rolls the
programs back by stealth, without regard to need. Raising the
 retirement age  in line with improvements in  life expectancy  is a
good way. Instead of resisting this, the left should advocate it
as a way of advancing the program’s core purpose: supporting the
incomes of those who most need help.  Means-testing should be on the left’s agenda as well.
Safety nets are too important to be regarded as untouchable.
They can either be reformed cautiously, with the needs of the
unlucky uppermost, or one day they will be overwhelmed and
demolished regardless.  One of the hardest things the left must do is reconsider
its traditional alliance with labor unions. In making government
more effective and affordable -- for the purpose of preserving
its services, not eliminating them -- liberals need to see
unions for what they often are: the enemies of reform.  In the U.S., education is the clearest instance. Control of
costs is not the main issue. The challenge is to repurpose
education so that it can meet the new economic demands. The
premium is on supply-side flexibility, which unions
instinctively despise. Teachers’ unions are powerful enough to
block change -- both at the micro level in the running of
individual schools and at the macro level in the design of the
system. America’s failing schools may be its biggest economic
problem.  Bidding Unions Farewell  In the U.S. and U.K., unions are no longer a significant
force outside the public sector. In other countries, they still
are. Where they follow a tradition of cooperation rather than
confrontation with company bosses (as in much of northern
Europe), the results can be good. At the other extreme is  Spain ,
whose fascist-era pact between owners and unions has created a
two-tier labor market of protected insiders and disposable
outsiders, pushed the  unemployment rate  to 24 percent and
rising, and helped bring the country to the brink of ruin. A
fair deal for labor-market outsiders is one more reason the left
needs to be more discriminating in its alliance with organized
labor.  That should be part of a larger shift in thinking. Instead
of resisting and demonizing the forces that are reshaping
economies -- a futile posture favored by the old left and its
friends -- liberals should think harder about how to exploit
them. Richer countries can afford better public services. They
can do more to furnish opportunities for the disadvantaged to
move up. They can help more people share in the benefits of
economic growth. Here is where the left should focus its
attention.  Instead it gets distracted. It’s quick to see evil
conspiracy behind faster job turnover and the surging success of
the richest sliver of the 1 percent -- as though you can only
win by stealing from the losers. The whole system, in this view,
is a semi-criminal enterprise. Well, the pay of some CEOs is
outrageous and can only be explained as a failure of corporate
governance. And parts of the economy, notably banking, have used
their political clout to benefit from implicit public subsidy.
Those real systemic defects need to be confronted. But they
aren’t the core of what’s happening.  Suppose bad men weren’t gaming the system. Globalization
and IT would still be sufficient to polarize the jobs market,
skew the demand for skills, destroy careers-for-life and channel
a bigger share of income to the successful. But globalization
and IT are not threats to be resisted, much less crimes to be
punished. Like earlier industrial revolutions, this one will
have bad consequences that need to be addressed. But
overwhelmingly, this transformation is a force for progress.
That is something the left should not set its face against.  (Clive Crook is a Bloomberg View columnist. The opinions
