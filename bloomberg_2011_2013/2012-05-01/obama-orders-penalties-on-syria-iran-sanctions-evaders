President  Barack Obama  signed an
executive order today barring from the U.S. marketplace any
person or entity that has helped Syria or  Iran  violate U.S.
sanctions.  The move follows an April 23 executive order that sanctions
companies that sell  information technology  such as tracking and
monitoring programs that regimes such as Syria and Iran use to
crack down on dissidents.  Existing sanctions forbid banks and large financial firms
from moving Syrian or Iranian funds through the U.S. financial
system. Todayâ€™s order lets the U.S. target smaller individuals
and entities, such as exchange houses or trading companies.  They can be named and barred from the U.S. financial and
commercial system if they either facilitate the movement of
Syrian or Iranian funds through the U.S. or if they deceive
others by hiding the involvement of the sanctioned entity.  A Treasury Department official, who briefed reporters under
rules that prohibit using his name, said the new sanctions will
allow the U.S. to reach evaders that were hard to hit under
existing authorities.  Those who believe they are wrongly accused under the new
order can challenge their designation at the Office of Foreign
Assets Control or through the courts, the official said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
