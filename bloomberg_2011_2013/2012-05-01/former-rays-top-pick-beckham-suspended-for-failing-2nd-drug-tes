Tim Beckham, the first overall pick by
the  Tampa Bay Rays  in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft, was
suspended 50 games after a second violation of minor-league
baseball’s drug policy.  The 22-year-old shortstop tested positive for a
recreational drug, according to an e-mailed statement today from
the office of baseball Commissioner  Bud Selig . The undisclosed
substance was classified in the release as a “drug of abuse,”
rather than a performance-enhancing substance.  Beckham received a $6.15 million signing bonus, at the time
a record for a draft pick, with the Rays in 2008, according to
the  Tampa Bay Times . He was hitting .204 with six runs scored
and one stolen base in 13 games this season with the  Durham
Bulls , Tampa Bay’s Triple-A affiliate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
