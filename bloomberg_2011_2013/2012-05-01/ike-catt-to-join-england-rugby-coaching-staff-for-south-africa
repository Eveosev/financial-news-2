Mike Catt will join the  England  rugby
team’s coaching staff for next month’s tour of South Africa, the
Rugby Football Union said.  Catt, a coach with London Irish, will join Stuart
Lancaster’s staff after the team’s final Premiership game this
weekend, the RFU said in a  statement . The South African-born
Catt helped England win the 2003 World Cup during his 75
appearances with the national team.  The  RFU  also said that former All Blacks coach Wayne Smith
turned down a chance to join the England squad to remain in New
Zealand for family reasons.  England will play three Tests against two-time world
champion South Africa as part of its five-match tour June 9 to
23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
