Barwa Real Estate Co. (BRES) , the Middle
East’s biggest property company by assets, said first-quarter
profit fell by almost half after a loss from revaluation of
investment properties.  Net income, excluding non-controlling interests, fell to
292.5 million riyals ($80 million) from 548.5 million riyals a
year earlier, according to a  statement  posted on the Qatar
Exchange. Barwa lost 25.4 million riyals from property
revaluation, against a 420.1 million-riyal gain a year earlier.  Qatari real estate is recovering from excessive home- and
office-construction before the global economic downturn four
years ago. Average rental rates for apartments and villas were
unchanged in Doha, the capital, during the first quarter, even
as the leasing market “picked up significantly,” according to
a report last month by Asteco, a real-estate services company.  Barwa, in which government-controlled Qatari Diar Real
Estate Investment Co. owns the  biggest stake , is also developing
properties in countries such as  Egypt , the U.K. and  Russia ,
according to its website. The company’s revenue fell to 650.6
million riyals in the first quarter, from 1.3 billion riyals a
year earlier, according to the statement.  Barwa’s stock  was down 3.1 percent, at 27.05 riyals, on the
Qatar Exchange at the 12:30 p.m. close of trading today, the
biggest decline since March 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
