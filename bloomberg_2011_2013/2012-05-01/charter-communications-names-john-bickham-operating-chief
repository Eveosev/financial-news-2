Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) , the
fourth-largest U.S. cable-television provider, named John Bickham chief operating officer, filling a job that had been
open since 2010.  He joins the company from  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , where
he was president of cable and communications, St. Louis-based
Charter said today in a statement. In December, Charter named
former Cablevision COO Thomas Rutledge chief executive officer.
Bickham resigned from Cablevision in November.  “We’ve worked together for many years and I’m confident in
his ability to help this organization achieve its full
potential,” Rutledge said in the statement.  Charter hasn’t had a chief operating officer since Mike Lovett in 2010. Lovett was promoted to CEO and ran the company
until February, when Rutledge took over. Charter provides cable-
TV, Internet or phone service to more than 5 million customers
in 25 states.  Bickham signed a four-year contract with a base salary of
$1.38 million, with annual increases as determined by Charter’s
compensation committee, according to a  company filing . Before
joining Cablevision in 2004, Bickham was executive vice
president at Time Warner Cable Inc.  Charter rose 0.9 percent to $61.02 at the close in  New
York . The  shares  have gained 7.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
