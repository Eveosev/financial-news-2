Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s Austrian
Airlines subsidiary will transfer all flight operations, with
about 80 aircraft and 2,100 employees, to its Tyrolean Airways
unit to cut costs and improve profitability.  The company made the decision, which will take effect on
July 1, after it proved “impossible to reach agreement over
principles” with the company’s works council, Vienna-based
Austrian said in an e-mailed  statement  last night.  The transfer of flight operations to Innsbruck-based
Tyrolean, where contracts are 25 percent less costly, will help
Austrian to make 220 million euros ($292 million) of cost
savings. The company posted a 62 million-euro loss in 2011.  “The executive board views this as a measure which will
secure the future of Austrian Airlines, as the step will result
in automatic salary increases being abolished, and a modern
collective agreement introduced,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
