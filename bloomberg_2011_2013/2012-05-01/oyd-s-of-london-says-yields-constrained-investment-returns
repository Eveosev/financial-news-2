Lloyd’s of  London , the world’s oldest
insurance market, said low yields on corporate bonds eroded
equity investment gains in the first quarter.  Lloyd’s investments returned 49 million pounds ($79
million) in the period, the market said in a statement today.  The second quarter has been “less encouraging as fears
about the solvency of sovereigns in the euro zone re-emerge,”
the market said. “The very low general level of available
yields continues to constrain investment returns.”  Lloyd’s in March posted a pretax loss of 516 million pounds
in 2011 from a 2.2 billion-pound profit in 2010 after the worst
year for natural-catastrophe claims on record. Chief Executive
Officer Richard Ward said at the time that the market is
struggling to raise prices, following earthquakes in  Japan  and
 New Zealand , windstorms in the U.S. and flooding in  Thailand .  The market’s surplus assets increased by 46 million pounds
to 3.03 billion pounds from the year end, Lloyd’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
