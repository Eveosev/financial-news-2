Banks stopped lending to companies
owning ships that carry minerals and other dry-bulk commodities,
said Robert Buchanan, president of  Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd. (GNK)   Following are comments by Buchanan and Chairman Peter Georgiopoulos on a conference call today. Genco, a  New York- 
based operator of 53 dry-bulk vessels, yesterday reported a
first-quarter net loss of $33.1 million on a 41 percent plunge
in sales to $59.8 million.  “Banks are not lending” to dry-bulk shipping, Buchanan
said. “You take a pool of banks -- I would bet you maybe 25
percent are actually still lending, and they are focusing on LNG
and offshore.”  “We are bouncing around the bottom here,” the chairman
said. “I think we’ve definitely hit bottom, and it’s just a
matter now how long this bottom lasts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
