A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
credit risk fell as manufacturing in the world’s biggest economy
unexpectedly expanded in April at the fastest pace in 10 months.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, dropped 0.9 basis point to a mid-price of 93.9
basis points at 5:20 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  The swaps index fell after the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s  factory index  climbed to 54.8 last month, exceeding
the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, from
53.4 in March, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s report showed
today. Readings greater than 50 signal growth. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a slower pace in April
compared to the previous month.  China ’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to 53.3 in April,
the highest reading in a year, from 53.1 in March, the country’s
statistics bureau and logistics federation said in a statement.  Credit-default swaps typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
