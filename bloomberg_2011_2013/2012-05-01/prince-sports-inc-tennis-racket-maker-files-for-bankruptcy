Prince Sports Inc., a pioneer maker of
tennis gear, sought  bankruptcy protection  citing as much as $100
million each in assets and debts, and said it plans to revise
its business model to make the company more competitive.  Among the Bordentown, New Jersey-based company’s largest
unsecured creditors listed in Chapter 11 documents filed today
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware, were Da Sheng
International Holding Ltd. of Taiwan and Pais International Ltd.
and Marshal Industrial Corp., both of  Hong Kong , each owed more
than $1.9 million in trade debt.  Decline in market demand “combined with increased
competition over the past five years” and a decrease in
“consumer discretionary spending” led to the bankruptcy, said
Gordon Boggis, chief executive officer, in court papers.  He said the company plans to cancel secured debt in
exchange for new equity as part of its reorganization plan.  The case is In re Prince Sports Inc., 12-BK-11439,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
