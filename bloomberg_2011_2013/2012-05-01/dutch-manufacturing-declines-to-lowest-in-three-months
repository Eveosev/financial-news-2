Manufacturing in the Netherlands fell
to the lowest in three months in April, according to the Dutch
institute for purchasing and supply management, NEVI.  The measure of manufacturing in the fifth-largest economy
in the euro region dropped to 49 from 49.6 in March, the
Zoetermeer, Netherlands-based NEVI said on its website today. It
was the first time this year the measure declined, said the
institute, which cited a drop in domestic orders, a slight
increase in unemployment and a general worsening of the economic
situation.  The index is based on a survey of about 350 purchasing
managers by Markit Economics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
