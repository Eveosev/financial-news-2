Indonesia’s rupiah dropped and
 government bonds  were steady before official data forecast to
show inflation accelerated for a second month.  Consumer prices rose 4.46 percent in April from a year
earlier, the most since September, according to the  median
estimate  of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The report is
due around 11 a.m. in Jakarta.  “If inflation reaches above 4.5 percent then we may see
the rupiah weaken beyond 9,200 per dollar,” said Dave Hartono,
a Jakarta-based foreign-exchange trader at PT Bank ICBC
Indonesia. “Otherwise, it will be in a very tight range of
9,170 to 9,200 for the week.”  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 9,194 per dollar of 8:55
a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 5.50 percent,
the lowest level since August.  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds was
steady at 5.96 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Indonesia  is ready to start restricting sales of subsidized
fuel this month, which the central bank predicts will boost
consumer-price gains to 4.7 percent this year, Perry Warjiyo,
director for economic and monetary-policy research at the
central bank, said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
