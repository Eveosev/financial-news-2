Mexico  City had no reported damages
after a 5.7-magnitude earthquake shook buildings at 11:38 a.m.
local time.  The epicenter of the quake was in the western state of
Michoacan, 128 miles (206 kilometers) southwest of Mexico City,
the  U.S. Geological Survey  said on its  website .  Mexico City’s subway, hospitals, water system, roads and
power grid were operating normally, Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said on
his Twitter account.  “No news in the city, we don’t have damages,” he wrote.  Today is a national holiday in Mexico. A 7.4 temblor shook
the capital on March 20, the strongest since 2003.  To contact the reporters on this story:
