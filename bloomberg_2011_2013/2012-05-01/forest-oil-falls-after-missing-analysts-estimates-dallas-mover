the biggest drop since Feb. 22. Before today, the shares
declined 1.7 percent this year.  Forest yesterday reported profit fell 39 percent to $13
million, or 11 cents a share, from the 2011 first quarter after
excluding a writedown of natural-gas properties in Italy and

according to the average of 22 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Revenue fell 4.8 percent to $158.9 million, according to
