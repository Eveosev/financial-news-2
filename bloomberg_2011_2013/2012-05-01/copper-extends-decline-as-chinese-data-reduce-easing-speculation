Copper declined for a second day after
data showed  China ’s manufacturing accelerated in April, damping
speculation that the world’s second-largest economy will add
monetary stimulus to support growth. Aluminum dropped.  Three-month delivery copper fell as much as 0.4 percent to
$8,367.50 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange and traded
at $8,385 at 3:12 p.m. Tokyo time. The contract retreated 0.5
percent in April, a second monthly decline. July-delivery metal
was little changed at $3.8235 a pound on the Comex. The Shanghai
Futures Exchange is closed for a public holiday.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to 53.3 last month from
53.1 in March, China’s statistics bureau and logistics
federation said in a statement today. The data signal China may
be strengthening from the slowest  pace  of growth in almost three
years, reached last quarter.  “Improvement in China’s manufacturing may give an excuse
for the nation not to issue additional stimulus immediately, as
the Chinese government is still struggling with inflationary
pressure,” Ken Kajisa, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in
Tokyo, said today by phone.  China’s PMI for April was the highest reading in a year and
compares with the 53.6 median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 27 economists. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.
At issue for Premier  Wen Jiabao  is whether to extend a two-month
pause in lowering banks’ required reserve ratios, as he seeks to
rein in property and consumer prices without sending the economy
into a so-called hard landing.  Copper was also dragged down by concerns about U.S. and
European economies as American business activity expanded at the
slowest pace since November 2009, and  Spain ’s economy sank into
recession, Kajisa said. The  Institute for Supply Management-
Chicago Inc.  said yesterday its barometer decreased to 56.2,
lower than the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey, from 62.2 in March.  Aluminum in London dropped 0.3 percent to $2,112.75 per ton,
zinc was little changed at $2,060.50 a ton and lead was little
changed at $2,145.75 a ton. Tin was little changed at $22,750
per ton and nickel climbed 0.3 percent to $17,939 a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
