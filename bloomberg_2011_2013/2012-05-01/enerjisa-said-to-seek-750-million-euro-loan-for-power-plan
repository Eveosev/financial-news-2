Enerjisa Enerji Uretim AS, a Turkish
electricity provider, is seeking a 750 million-euro ($994
million) loan, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.  The Istanbul-based company will use the 12-year facility to
help finance the development of a 450 megawatt lignite-fired
 power plant  and associated mine, said the person, who declined
to be named because the terms are private. Syndication is due to
close at the end of this month.  Enerjisa got a 12-year 700 million-euro  term loan  paying
225 basis points more than benchmark rates in March 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The company is owned by Vienna-based  Verbund AG (VER)  and  Haci
Omer Sabanci Holding As (SAHOL)  in Istanbul. Ines Schurin, a spokeswoman
for Verbund, did not respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
