Greenpeace activists occupied a  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  icebreaker in  Finland , protesting the company’s
plans to drill for oil off Alaska.  Twenty activists boarded the Nordica icebreaker this
morning and have locked themselves on to the vessel in a bid to
prevent it from traveling to Alaska, where drilling is poised to
start, the environmental organization said today in a  statement .  Shell and the U.S. Interior Department say they’ve taken
steps to ensure drilling in the waters off Alaska will be safe
and any spills promptly contained. The oil producer, which has
spent about $4 billion on Arctic leases, equipment and research
since 2005, said its plans are the best in the industry.  “ Oil companies  know full well that an  oil spill  off the
Alaskan coast would devastate the environment and prove
impossible to clean up,” Greenpeace Campaign Manager Tapio
Laakso said in the statement. The icebreaker, owned by the
Finnish government, is under contract to The Hague-based Shell,
while sister ship Fennica is already in Alaska, Greenpeace said.  Shell confirmed that protesters had boarded the Nordica in
Helsinki harbor today and said local police were at the scene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
