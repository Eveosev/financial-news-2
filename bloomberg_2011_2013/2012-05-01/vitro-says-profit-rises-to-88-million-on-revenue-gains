  Vitro SAB (VITROA) , the Mexican glassmaker
that defaulted three years ago, posted a 14 percent gain in
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
in the first quarter as sales increased in the company’s
automotive, construction and bottle markets.  Ebitda was 1.14 billion pesos ($88 million), compared with
998 million pesos a year earlier, the San Pedro Garza Garcia,
Mexico-based company said in a statement. Sales rose to 5.76
billion pesos from 5.06 billion pesos.  Vitro defaulted on $1.5 billion of debt, including $1.2
billion of bonds, in February 2009, amid a recession that
reduced demand for construction and auto glass. In February this
year, the company received Mexican  bankruptcy court  approval for
a debt restructuring plan. Some bondholders continue to oppose
the plan in Mexican and U.S. courts.  The bondholders have argued it was unfair for $1.9 billion
of intercompany loans that Vitro created after the default to be
included in a vote on the reorganization. A hearing on an appeal
by bondholders is  scheduled  for tomorrow in the  U.S. Court of
Appeals  in  New Orleans .  In addition, at a June trial in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Dallas, Judge Harlin Hale will consider whether to enforce
Vitro’s Mexican reorganization in the U.S.  Vitro’s net income amounted to 7.43 billion pesos in the
first quarter, compared with 136 million pesos a year earlier.  “This reflects the effect of the implementation of our
debt restructuring plan on February 23, 2012,” the company said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
