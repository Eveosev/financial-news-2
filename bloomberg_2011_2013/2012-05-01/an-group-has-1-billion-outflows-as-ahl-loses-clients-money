Man Group Plc (EMG) , the world’s biggest
publicly traded hedge fund manager, reported that clients
withdrew a net $1 billion in the first quarter, while costs such
as employee bonuses ate up more cash than analysts expected.  The  shares  slid as much as 8 percent as analysts cut their
earnings forecasts for the company. Clients redeemed $4.1
billion from Man’s investment funds, which was partly offset by
$3.1 billion of sales, the London-based company said today.  Man reported that net cash fell 56 percent to $250 million
in the three months ended in March, raising concern that it’s
spending too much money at a time when profits are falling.
Finance Director Kevin Hayes said on a call with analysts that
staff bonuses, taxes and loans to some of Man Group’s funds
accounted for the lower cash reserve. Analysts had reduced
estimates for Man’s fee revenue after its biggest hedge fund,
the $19.5 billion AHL computerized trading system, fell about
2.1 percent this year and lost 6 percent in 2011.  “The surprise to me was how low the net cash position
was,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Peter Lenardos said in an
interview. “Man will pay an uncovered dividend this year, so
the balance sheet could get weaker.”  Man Group said in March it plans to pay a  dividend  for 2012
of 22 cents a share.  ‘Seasonal’ Cash Drop  The company’s drop in cash was attributable to “seasonal
factors” such as yearly bonuses that were paid out in the
quarter, and money lent to funds has been repaid, Man Group
spokesman David Waller said. “Man remains a highly cash
generative business with a strong financial position,” he said.  The  shares  fell 6 percent to 97.3 pence at 4:16 p.m. London
time, giving Man a market value of 1.77 billion pounds ($2.87
billion). The shares dipped below their closing price on April
24, when they began a week-long rally on speculation Man’s stock
drop over the past year may spur a sale of the company.  Assets under management increased to $59 billion from $58.4
billion after rising stock markets in the first three months of
the year led to gains at the company’s GLG unit. That exceeded
Lenardos’s estimate of $58.8 billion. Gurjit Kambo of Credit
Suisse AG forecast $58.5 billion.  Takeover Target  The  stock  fell to an 11-year low last week, leaving Man
trading at a 35 percent discount to the value of its assets
minus liabilities. Arnaud Giblat, an analyst at UBS AG, said
last week that the decline has made Man Group a takeover target
as potential buyers would pay a low price for its distribution
network in  Asia  and hedge-fund fees that typically outpace those
on mutual funds.  “We don’t feel that we need a big brother” to reach Man’s
goals, Chief Executive Officer  Peter Clarke  said on a call with
reporters. He declined to comment on the takeover speculation,
while saying shareholders continue to support management.  About 85 percent of shareholders voted in favor of Clarke’s
$6.98 million pay package for 2011 at the company’s annual
meeting today, Man Group said in a statement today.  Investors also re-elected Chairman Jon Aisbitt and eight
other directors, including Clarke, to the board.  Outflows from Man Group’s investment funds were $300
million less than estimated by Kambo, who has an outperform
rating on the stock. Redemptions declined 27 percent from the
$5.6 billion that clients pulled in the fourth quarter. Sales
were unchanged from the three months ended in December and will
likely remain “muted” until Man Group improves its  investment
performance , Clarke said.  Analyst Downgrades  Peel Hunt analyst Stuart Duncan cut his rating on Man Group
to hold from buy after the company announced results today.  “A significant discount is deserved” for Man Group shares
compared with rivals, given the company’s dependence on AHL,
Deutsche Bank AG analyst Carolyn Dorrett wrote in a note to
clients today. There is “downside risk” to consensus analyst
estimates that Man Group will earn 11.3 cents a share this year,
said Dorrett, who has a hold rating on the company.  Man Group, the worst-performing member of the U.K.
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  over the past year, has tried to
improve AHL by slowing the speed of trades, diversifying its
investments and hiring additional scientists to oversee the
program. AHL attempts to capture trends in futures prices of
assets ranging from currencies to commodities and stocks.  AHL Performance  AHL funds would have to rise about 14 percent on average to
hit their so-called high-water mark, the point at which Man
Group earns the most lucrative fees for positive investment
performance, the company said in the statement.  Moody’s Investors Service said last month it was reviewing
Man’s debt for a possible downgrade, citing reduced assets under
management, falling sales, lower profit margins for GLG products
versus AHL and fund underperformance. Moody’s, which gives Man
debt its second-lowest investment grade, also questioned whether
“high fees” charged by hedge funds were sustainable.  RBC’s Lenardos has said Man should consider cutting fees
charged on AHL, a 25-year-old fund that’s priced at a premium to
competitors with better recent returns. Man charges AHL
investors 3 percent a year to oversee their assets and takes 20
percent of investment gains, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Most hedge funds charge investors a management fee of
2 percent and 20 percent of any profits.  Rival Funds  Winton Futures Fund Ltd., which also relies on computer
models to predict trends in futures prices, charges a 1 percent
management fee and a 20 percent performance fee. The $10.2
billion Winton fund, overseen by Cambridge University-educated
physicist and AHL founder David Harding, has risen about 9
percent a year on average since the start of the financial
crisis in 2008, beating AHL’s annual gains of about 4 percent.
Winton has had just one down year.  BlueCrest Capital Management LLP’s $14 billion BlueTrend
Fund has gained an average 16 percent yearly since 2008, while
charging a 2 percent management fee and a 20 percent performance
fee, and never incurring a loss since its 2005 inception.  UBS is calling Man Group a takeover target less than two
years after it bought GLG Partners Inc. for $1.6 billion.
Clarke, 51, acquired London-based GLG, which has individual
hedge-fund managers who trade stocks, bonds and currencies,
after analysts questioned whether Man was too reliant on AHL.  The strategy paid off initially, as sales growth drove a
3.5 percent increase in assets under management to $71 billion
in the first six months of 2011.  GLG Deal  The European sovereign debt crisis then triggered volatile
markets in August and September that hindered performance at
GLG, prompting clients to withdraw money. Man Group assets under
management fell to $58.4 billion by the end of the year.  The decline in Man Group’s shares has hurt executives who
joined the company from GLG after the acquisition and received
stock as part of the buyout. GLG co-founder Pierre LaGrange, 50,
who oversees the European Long-Short hedge fund, owns about 3.5
percent of Man’s stock. Former GLG co-CEO Emmanuel Roman, 48,
who serves as Man Group’s chief operating officer, owns a 1
percent stake. Noam Gottesman, 50, who shared the CEO title with
Roman at GLG, holds about 2 percent of Man Group.  The stock was priced at 221 pence a share when LaGrange,
Roman and Gottesman received it in 2010, more than double its
current value, according to Man Group filings. The executives
are restricted from selling most of it until October 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
