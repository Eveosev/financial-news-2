Carnival Corp. (CCL) ’s AIDA Cruises will
continue to grow faster than the market in 2012 after reporting
a 14 percent increase in passengers last year, said Michael Thamm, president of the unit.  Rostock, Germany-based AIDA carried 584,000 passengers on
its eight  cruise ships  last year, Thamm said in an e-mailed
 statement  today. Passenger numbers at AIDA jumped 11 percent in
the first quarter while April order growth was “well above”
last year’s level, he said.  Thamm will replace Pier Luigi Foschi in July as chief
executive officer of Carnival’s Costa Crociere division, owner
of the Concordia cruise ship that ran aground in  Italy  in
January, killing at least 25 people, Miami-based Carnival said
on April 23. Costa includes AIDA and Spanish ship operator Ibero
Cruises.  To contact the reporter on this story:
