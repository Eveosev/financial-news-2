profit of 45 million dirhams, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Group revenue declined 11 percent to 219 million

organizational efficiencies, operating costs declined 25 percent
and operating profit increased 14 percent compared to the same
period last year,” Chief Executive Officer Sujit Parhar said in
the statement. “Net finance costs were notably lower reflecting
our stable and improved capital structure.”  Tabreed said one new plant came online in the first
