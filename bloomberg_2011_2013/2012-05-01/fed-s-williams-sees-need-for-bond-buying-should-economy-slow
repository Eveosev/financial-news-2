Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
President John C. Williams said he would see the need for
additional bond buying by the central bank if the pace of
economic growth flagged enough to stall labor market gains.  “One threshold for me, in my own thinking, would be if we
see economic growth slow to the point where we’re not seeing
further progress in bringing the  unemployment rate  down,”
Williams said today on a panel in Beverly Hills, California.
Stimulus might also be needed if inflation dropped
“significantly” below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, he said.  Those aren’t “the circumstances I currently expect,” said
Williams, who votes on the policy-setting  Federal Open Market
Committee  this year. If additional rounds of bond buying are
warranted, the Fed may purchase more mortgage-debt, or extend
its program to push out the average-maturity of its holdings,
dubbed Operation Twist, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
