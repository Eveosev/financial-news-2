New Zealand  cricket coach John Wright
will step down following the team’s tour of the West Indies
after turning down a contract extension.  Wright, a former opening batsman and captain of the
national team, took over as coach in December 2010 and led the
team to semifinals of the Cricket World Cup the following year.  “I appreciate the offer to extend my contract, but after
much consideration I feel it’s the right time to move on and
look at other opportunities,” Wright said in an e-mailed
statement from New Zealand Cricket.  New Zealand faces the West Indies in two Twenty20
internationals in Lauderhill,  Florida , on June 30 and July 1
before taking on the Caribbean team in five one-day games and a
two-match Test series finishing Aug. 2.  New Zealand Cricket will “take the time to find the right
candidate who can take us through to the 2015 Cricket World
Cup,” chief executive officer David White said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
