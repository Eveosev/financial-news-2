Vince Young , a two-time Pro Bowl
quarterback who was a backup for the Philadelphia Eagles last
season, will work out for the Buffalo Bills tomorrow.  Young, 28, appeared in seven games for the Eagles, starting
three when Michael Vick was injured, and completed 66 of 114
passes for four touchdowns and nine interceptions.  Young spent his first five National Football League seasons
in Tennessee after being taken with the third pick in the 2006
draft and had a 30-17 record as a starter. Young was released in
January 2011 after having a verbal confrontation with former
Titans coach  Jeff Fisher .  Young is being looked at as a potential backup to Buffaloâ€™s
starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, the National Football
League team said on their  website . The Bills also have Brad
Smith and Tyler Thigpen on its roster at the position and
yesterday signed former University of Richmond quarterback Aaron
Corp as an undrafted free agent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
