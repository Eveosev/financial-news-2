A U.K. gauge of new job growth fell to
a three-month low in April as demand for workers in banking and
health care slowed, recruitment company Reed.co.uk said.  The Reed Job Index dropped to 134 from 142 in March, the
London-based company said in a report today. An index of
salaries slipped 1 point to 98 as pay offers on new jobs
declined, Reed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
