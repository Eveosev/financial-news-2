President Narayana Kocherlakota said improving economic growth
among American Indians requires different institutional and
policy changes than in most rural areas.  “We must seek policies, laws, and institutions that enable
tribes to pursue the cultural and political objectives they
truly value,” Kocherlakota said today in a conference in
 Washington  on “Growing Economies in Indian Country: A National
Summit.” He did not discuss the outlook for the national
economy or monetary policy in his remarks.  Kocherlakota highlighted the “economic gap” for American
Indians on reservations, including lower incomes, higher rates
of poverty and elevated unemployment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
