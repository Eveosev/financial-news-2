News Corp. (NWSA)  carried out a cover-up of
its “rampant” lawbreaking, said Tom Watson, an opposition
Labour Party member of Parliament’s culture committee.  “The two men at the top of the company need to answer for
that,” he told a press conference in London today. “In the
view of the majority of committee members, Rupert Murdoch isn’t
fit to run an international company.”  He added, “I’m personally disappointed that some members
of the committee didn’t feel confident to hold the most powerful
to account.”  Watson said he had “reason to believe” that the Serious
Organised Crime Agency is holding evidence of computer hacking
by News Corp. papers. He urged Parliament’s Home Affairs
Committee to investigate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
