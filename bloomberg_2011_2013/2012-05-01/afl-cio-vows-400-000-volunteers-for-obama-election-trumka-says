The AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest
labor federation, may deploy as many as 400,000 volunteers this
year in its effort to re-elect  Barack Obama , who President
 Richard Trumka  said helped save tens of thousands of U.S. jobs.  The volunteers, accounting for about 3 percent of the 12
million members in AFL-CIO affiliates, will talk to friends,
neighbors and co-workers in a get-out-the-vote effort, Trumka
said today at a meeting of the  Building and Construction Trades
Department  in Washington. Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney , a former Massachusetts governor, wouldn’t look out for
workers’ interest and is beholden to wealthy donors, Trumka
said.  “If Mitt Romney is elected president, I guarantee you
we’ll be back in a recession,” he said.  The AFL-CIO unanimously endorsed Obama’s re-election as
president at a meeting in March, citing his efforts to overhaul
Wall Street trading rules and rewrite U.S. health-care laws.  Labor unions spent a record $450 million in 2008 electing
Obama and Democrats to Congress, though haven’t said how much
they plan to spend in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
