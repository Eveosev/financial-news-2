The Iranian government asked for $2
billion in basic commodities to be stocked up ahead of subsidy
reforms in the Persian Gulf nation,  Mehr  reported, citing
officials.  Iranian Vice-President Mohammad Reza Rahimi said $2 billion
was allocated for the stocking up of “essential” goods, the
state-run  news agency  said in a report on its website today.  Iran ’s Industries, Mines and Commerce Ministry received an
order to start stocking up essential and sensitive items, an
unidentified ministry official had earlier told Mehr, according
to the report. Rice, cooking oil, sugar, red meat, chicken meat
and corn are among the commodities listed, the person said.  The move is aimed at regulating the market as the
government looks at proceeding with reforms it started in
December 2010 to phase out subsidies on food and energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
