Macy’s Inc. (M)  has refused to make Chief
Executive Officer Terry Lundgren available for a deposition in
its lawsuit against  Martha Stewart Living (MSO)  Omnimedia Inc.,
according to a court filing.  Martha Stewart  Living, in a letter filed today, asked  New
York  State Supreme Court Justice Jeffrey Oing to order Macy’s to
make Lundgren available “as soon as possible,” saying he has
“unique, relevant personal knowledge.” Martha Stewart Living’s
namesake founder and President Lisa Gersh have already been
deposed in the case, along with four Macy’s employees, according
to the letter.  “It has become clear that Mr. Lundgren personally played
an instrumental role in the contract negotiations and other
business activities that are at the center of this dispute,”
lawyers for Martha Stewart Living said in the letter.  Macy’s, based in Cincinnati, sued in January to stop New
York-based Martha Stewart Living from executing a sales
agreement announced in December with  J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  Macy’s said
it has the exclusive right to sell Martha Stewart-branded
products in certain categories.  J.C. Penney, based in Plano, Texas, acquired a 17 percent
stake in Martha Stewart Living for $38.5 million as the U.S.
department-store chain seeks to revive sales with new mini-
stores dedicated to the brand.  Macy’s will respond to the court and didn’t have any
comment in the interim, Jim Sluzewski, a spokesman for the
company, said in an e-mail.  The case is Macy’s Inc. v. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc., 650197/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
