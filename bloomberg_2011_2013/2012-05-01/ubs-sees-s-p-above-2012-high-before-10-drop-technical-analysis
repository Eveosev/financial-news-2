Stock market trend charts and investor
sentiment are signaling the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  may
surpass its 2012 high before the rally gives way to a 10 percent
decline, according to  UBS AG. (UBSN)   The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities is likely to exceed
this year’s peak of 1,419.04 and climb to 1,460, after it held
last month above its March 6 low, said Michael Riesner and Marc
Mueller, Zurich-based analysts with UBS. The S&P 500 halted a
five-day slump on April 10 at 1,358.59. Two weeks later, it
rebounded from another drop at 1,358.79.  The level of 1,358 “represents a new pivotal support for
the SPX,” the analysts wrote in a note yesterday, referring to
the S&P 500’s ticker. “As long as the market trades above this
level, the U.S. market remains bullish biased,” they said.
“Given the fact that the SPX has not met our initial correction
target at 1,340 and on the back of the low bullish consensus, we
still can’t rule out a final overshooting.”  The  S&P 500  climbed 12 percent from January through March
for the best first-quarter rally since 1998 amid better-than-
forecast economic data and  corporate earnings . The advance
stalled in April as concern over  Europe ’s debt crisis and a
slowdown in  China  drove the index down 0.8 percent, the biggest
monthly decline since September.  ‘Top Building’  The retreat was “only the beginning of a complex top
building process,” Riesner and Mueller wrote. “Within this
process we always favored to see a final bounce/rally.”  The S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent last week, reversing a 0.8
percent loss during the first day of trading. The rebound helped
the index produce a buy signal on its Moving Average
Convergence/Divergence chart on April 26, with the MACD line,
calculated by subtracting the S&P 500’s average level during the
past 26 days from the average over the past 12 days, rising
above the “signal line,” which plots the 9-day average
difference between the two.  While stocks recovered,  bullish sentiment  among investors
remained low. A weekly survey from the  American Association  of
Individual Investors, released on April 26, showed 27.6 percent
of the respondents expected the market to rise over the next six
months, the lowest ratio since Sept. 22. Falling optimism is
considered as a contrarian indicator by some analysts who follow
charts to make market predictions, because investors who have
sold stocks now have more money to purchase shares.  “Generally, we have never seen a correction, let alone a
 bear market , starting with such a low bullish consensus, which
means the likelihood to see higher prices into later May is
high,” Riesner and Mueller said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
