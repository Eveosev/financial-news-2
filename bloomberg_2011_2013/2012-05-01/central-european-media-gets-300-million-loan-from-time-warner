Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV) , the TV broadcaster, is receiving $386.4 million in
financing from  Time Warner Inc. (TWC)  and billionaire  Ronald Lauder  to
pay debts coming due starting in 2013.  Time Warner will provide a $300 million loan, Central
European Media, known as CME, said yesterday in a statement. The
New York-based media company and Lauder’s RSL Capital LLC will
pay $86.4 million for 11.5 million Class A shares. Time Warner’s
stake will rise to 40 percent.  CME, a Bermuda-registered operator of television channels
in central and eastern  Europe , has been battling a slower-than-
expected pickup in advertising sales as regional economies
emerge from recession. CME had its shares cut to hold from buy
last month at Deutsche Bank AG, which said that a stagnant
advertising market will hurt  cash flow  and may force it to issue
new shares at a discount to the market price.  Time Warner and Lauder will pay $7.51 a share, according to
the statement. That’s 5.1 percent below yesterday’s close of
$7.91 in New York trading. The stock, which lost 1.1 percent
yesterday, has gained 21 percent this year.  Proceeds from the credit facility will be used to retire
existing obligations. CME intends to use money from the equity
sale to repay the new Time Warner loan. If the new debt is
outstanding for 180 days, Time Warner can increase its stake in
CME to 49.9 percent, according to the statement. RSL is buying 2
million shares.  Warner’s Stake  Time Warner purchased a 31 percent stake in CME for $241.5
million in May 2009 with the agreement that Lauder, CME’s
founder and non-executive chairman, will control Time Warner’s
voting rights in the company for at least four years. Time
Warner increased its stake to 34.4 percent in March 2011.  CME will purchase an aggregate of $300 million of 3.5
percent senior convertible notes due in 2013, senior floating
rate notes due 2014 and 11.625 percent senior notes due 2016,
the company said.  As part of the arrangement, Time Warner and Lauder will
convert Class B shares into Class A, the company said. The
accord is subject to a vote of CME’s shareholders, and Lauder
committed to voting stock he controls in favor of this
transaction, according to the statement.  (CME executives plan to discuss the transaction and first
quarter earnings on May 2 at 9 a.m. New York time. To listen,
