Canadian natural gas rose amid
forecasts for hotter-than-normal weather in the U.S. that would
boost demand for gas-fired generation to run air conditioners,
diverting the fuel from winter storage.  June gas in  Alberta  advanced 3.9 percent. U.S. stockpiles
probably rose 26 billion cubic feet last week, the median of
four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year
average increase is 79 billion, according to the Energy
Department.  Degree days “witnessed a dramatic increase last week in
the consuming east region,” Eric Bickel, a natural-gas analyst
with Summit Energy Services in Louisville, Kentucky, said in a
note today. Degree days are a measure of energy demand based on
temperature. Bickel estimates stockpiles rose 34 billion cubic
feet last week.  Alberta gas for June delivery rose 6.75 cents to C$1.81 a
gigajoule ($1.75 per million British thermal units) as of 4 p.m.
 New York  time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas has declined 37 percent this year.  Natural gas for June delivery rose 8.6 cents, or 3.8
percent, to settle at $2.371 per million Btu on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago jumped
19.29 cents, or 9 percent, to $2.3329 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 13.88 cents, or 7.2 percent, to $2.0684 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices advanced 13.24 cents, or 6.5 percent,
to $2.1653.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.5 billion cubic
feet, 330 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.04 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.2 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 934 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.72 billion cubic feet today, or 65 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.94
billion cubic feet at 3:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
