Tomas Borge Martinez, a founder of the
Sandinista guerilla movement that led the 1979 overthrow of
U.S.-backed dictator  Anastasio Somoza , died last night at age
81.  Borge, who co-founded the National Sandinista Liberation
Front party in 1961, had been suffering from a respiratory
illness for several weeks, according to a statement from
Nicaragua’s government. His death was announced on government
radio by Rosario Murillo, wife of current president and
Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega.  “He was a brave man, a man of many battles that was at the
head of all of the vital moments of the revolutionary fight,”
Murillo said on government station Radio Nicaragua. “Even in
death, Tomas will never die.”  During the 42-year rule of the Somoza family, Borge and
government dissidents formed the socialist Sandinista party
based on the ideals of Augusto Cesar Sandino, a rebel general
who fought U.S. occupation of  Nicaragua  in the 1920s and 1930s.
Borge was imprisoned in 1956 for three years for his alleged
knowledge of a plot to assassinate Somoza.  Borge served as the interior minister in the first
Sandinista government and became a target of the U.S.-backed
Contra rebels. He later served as a congressman and ambassador
to Ecuador and Peru.  Ortega declared three days of national mourning to honor
Borge’s death.  “The days of mourning are to honor his fight to liberate
and his fight to improve democracy,” Murillo said in a
statement today. “His life’s commitment to the revolution is
forever part of Nicaragua.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
