Spaniards marched in Madrid and
Barcelona in the second protest against Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s spending cuts and labor rules in three days.  In Barcelona, about 16,000 people took part in the
traditional May Day demonstration, said a police official in the
city who declined to be named. Officials in Madrid declined to
estimate how many people took part. Thousands protested against
spending cuts in 55 cities across Spain on April 29.  Rajoy came to power in December after winning the biggest
majority any Spanish party has secured since 1982. He has pushed
through a  labor  overhaul that reduces firing costs and trimmed
spending on health and education.  Support for his  People’s Party  fell 8 percentage points in
the month through mid-April to 38 percent, according to an
opinion poll published by El Pais on April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
