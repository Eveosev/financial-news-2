Two Federal Reserve regional bank
presidents said recent weak economic data, including first
quarter growth of 2.2 percent, hasn’t changed their forecasts
for the pace of the expansion.  “It’s too early in my mind for me to change my outlook,”
Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart  said today in an interview
on CNBC. “I’m a bit reticent at this time to pull the trigger
on any new action. I think we need to see how the economy
evolves.”  Lockhart was interviewed with Chicago Fed President  Charles Evans , who said the “table is still set for 2.5-to-3 percent
growth over the next 18 months.” Evans said he favors
additional monetary stimulus because “we ought to be doing
better.”  Fed presidents rotate voting on monetary policy with
Lockhart, who has never dissented from a decision of the  Federal
Open Market Committee , voting this year.  Evans is scheduled to vote next year. He dissented from
committee decisions in November and December last year, saying
the FOMC should increase stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
