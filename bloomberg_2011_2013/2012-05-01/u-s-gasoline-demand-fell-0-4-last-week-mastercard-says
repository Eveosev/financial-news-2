U.S. gasoline demand fell 0.4 percent
last week and consumption stayed below year-earlier levels for
the 35th consecutive week, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 8.65 million barrels  a day of gasoline in
the week ended April 27, down from 8.69 million the week before,
according to MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report. That was 5.6
percent below the year-earlier level.  The average pump price fell 6 cents to $3.84 a gallon, down
1.3 percent from a year earlier.  “While prices have dropped 10 cents in the past three
weeks, which is positive for gasoline consumption, gasoline
demand continues to post noticeable declines year over year,”
John Gamel, a gasoline analyst and director of economic analysis
for SpendingPulse, said in the report.  Fuel use over the previous four weeks fell 5.2 percent from
the same period in 2011, a record 58th consecutive drop in that
measure.  The highest prices are on the West Coast, where the average
fell 3 cents to $4.13 a gallon. The lowest prices were in the
 Gulf Coast , where a gallon sank 5 cents to $3.74.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
