Spanish Economy Minister Luis de
Guindos will meet European Union Competition Commissioner
 Joaquin Almunia  tomorrow as the country devises steps to clean
up its banking industry.  De Guindos and Almunia will meet in Brussels, said an
Economy Ministry spokeswoman who asked not to be named in line
with policy. She declined to give details on what they will
discuss. No one was available at Almunia’s office when contacted
by Bloomberg News today, which is a holiday in much of  Europe .  Less than three months after tightening legislation to
force lenders to recognize deeper real-estate losses,  Spain  is
seeking new ways to convince investors that bank losses won’t
overburden public finances. De Guindos said last week the
government will allow lenders to offload real-estate assets into
separate asset-management companies in order to free up capital
and allow them to concentrate on their ongoing businesses.  Banks will have to make provisions for the assets before
transferring them, and in the case of land those writedowns
amount to 80 percent, Guindos said on April 26. Guindos is also
expecting more bank mergers and “efforts by the banks to
restructure and clean up” in the coming days, he said
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
