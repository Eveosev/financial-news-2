Highfields Capital Management LP, the
$11 billion investment firm run by Jonathon S. Jacobson,
nominated an employee and two private-equity executives for
election to the board of  CoreLogic Inc. (CLGX)   Highfields put forward managing director Farhad Nanji, 33,
Barry Baker, 59, a managing director at BV Investment Partners,
and Glenn Christenson, 62, a managing director at Velstand
Investments LLC, the Boston-based firm said in a filing today.  Highfields in March said CoreLogic’s plan to add new
independent directors to its board doesn’t go far enough to
address investor concerns. The  Santa Ana , California-based
company, which sells property and credit data, said on Feb. 27
that its board voted to end a strategic review started in August
to explore options including a sale or merger of the company and
divestiture of some of its businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
