The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of 24
commodities climbed 0.02 percent to 685 at 4:09 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials dropped
0.1 percent to 1,586.729.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the lowest close in two days in New York
before a government report that may show crude inventories rose
to a 21-year high in the U.S., the world’s biggest consumer of
the commodity.  Crude for June delivery was at $104.66 a barrel, down 21
cents, on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:46 p.m. Sydney
time. The contract yesterday fell 6 cents to $104.87, the lowest
close since April 26. Prices gained 1.8 percent last month and
are 5.9 percent higher this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures rose for a third day as cooler weather
forecast for next week may help ease a glut.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold may advance for a sixth day, set for the best run
since August, as business activity in the U.S. expanded at the
slowest pace since November 2009, spurring demand for
alternative assets. Palladium reached the highest in almost six
weeks.  Gold for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.2 percent to
$1,667.95 an ounce, the most expensive since April 13, and
traded at $1,664.82 at 2:05 p.m. in Singapore. June-delivery
bullion gained as much as 0.3 percent to $1,668.90 an ounce on
the Comex in  New York .  Spot palladium rose as much as 0.6 percent to $686.75 an
ounce, the highest since March 22, and traded at $683.59.
Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by the metal
advanced for a third day to 60.189 tons yesterday, the highest
level since Sept. 29, Bloomberg data show.  BASE METALS  Copper declined for a second day after data showed  China ’s
manufacturing accelerated in April, damping speculation that the
world’s second-largest economy will add monetary stimulus to
support growth. Aluminum dropped.  Three-month delivery copper fell as much as 0.4 percent to
$8,367.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded
at $8,385 at 3:12 p.m. Tokyo time. The contract retreated 0.5
percent in April, a second monthly decline. July-delivery metal
was little changed at $3.8235 a pound on the Comex. The Shanghai
Futures Exchange is closed for a public holiday.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn dropped as planting in the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter, progressed faster than last year’s pace, boosting
expectations farmers will sow the most acres since 1937.  Corn for July delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent to $6.31
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $6.3225 at
2:07 p.m. in  Singapore . Prices dropped 1.5 percent in April on
speculation that rapid U.S. planting will boost yields.  Soybeans for July delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent to
$14.975 a bushel before trading at $15.0025. Prices have climbed
24 percent this year as dry weather in Argentina and  Brazil 
harmed crops. About 12 percent of the U.S. soybean crop  was
planted, compared with 6 percent a week ago and the previous
five-year average of 5 percent, the USDA said.  July-delivery wheat  dropped as much as 0.8 percent to
$6.495 a bushel before trading at $6.50.  Rubber advanced for a fourth day as data showed China’s
manufacturing accelerated in April, raising speculation demand
from the world’s largest consumer may expand.  October-delivery rubber gained as much as 1 percent to 316
yen a kilogram ($3,963 a metric ton), the highest level since
April 11, before settling at 313.9 yen on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange. The most-active contract lost 3.9 percent last month,
the second monthly decline. Grain markets: NI GRMKTS  To contact the reporter on this story:
