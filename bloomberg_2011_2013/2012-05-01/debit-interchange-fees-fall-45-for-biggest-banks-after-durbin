Debit-card interchange fees for the
largest banks fell 45 percent in last yearâ€™s fourth quarter from
2009 as U.S. caps took effect, according to data compiled by the
 Federal Reserve .  Average interchange fees for so-called non-exempt issuers,
or banks with more than $10 billion in assets, dropped to 24
cents on average during the quarter from 43 cents two years
earlier, according to Fed data released today. The shift
occurred as limits championed by U.S. Senator  Richard Durbin , an
Illinois Democrat, took effect.  Average fees received by banks and credit unions with less
than $10 billion in assets remained at 43 cents during the
fourth quarter, the data show.  The Fed capped debit fees at 21 cents per swipe, plus 5
basis points of the total and a conditional 1 cent for fraud
prevention. That replaced a formula that averaged 1.14 percent
of the purchase price, or about 43 cents for the typical $38
debit-card transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
