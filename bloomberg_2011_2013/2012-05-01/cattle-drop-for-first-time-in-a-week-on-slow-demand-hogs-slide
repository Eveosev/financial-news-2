Cattle declined for the first time in
a week on signs of slowing U.S. beef demand. Hog futures slid.  Spot-steer  prices  averaged $1.20 a pound yesterday, down
3.6 percent from $1.2445 a week earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. The outlook for ample cattle supplies in
the near-term and slow demand are pressuring prices, said Dick Quiter, a broker at McFarland Commodities LLC. Meatpackers
processed 238,000 cattle this week, down 3.3 percent from a week
earlier, USDA data show.  “Demand’s still on the light side,” Quiter said in a
telephone interview from Chicago. “There are plenty of cattle
around for the next three to four weeks. With demand being what
it is, packers aren’t going to be overzealous in chasing cattle
right now.”  Cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.5 percent to settle
at $1.13525 a pound at 1 p.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange. That’s the first decline since April 24 when the USDA
reported the first case of mad cow disease in the U.S. since
2006. Prices rallied 2.3 percent in the four sessions before
today.  Prices just got “overdone” and are coming down now, Chris Nagel, a market analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
 Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 0.3
percent to $1.542 a pound in Chicago.  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.1 percent to settle
at 85.85 cents a pound on the CME. The commodity has still
gained 1.8 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
