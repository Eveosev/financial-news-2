(Corrects headline, first paragraph to remove reference to
historical low for export growth after ministry revised data in
story originally published yesterday.)  Indian exports fell in March as
 Europe ’s debt crisis and slower Chinese growth hurt demand.  Merchandise shipments  dropped 5.7 percent from a year
earlier to $28.7 billion, the government said in a statement in
New Delhi today. Imports rose 24.3 percent to $42.6 billion,
leaving a trade deficit of $13.9 billion.  India’s trade deficit surged to a record $184.9 billion in
the fiscal year ended March 31 as elevated crude  oil prices 
stoked import bills and a struggling global recovery hurt
exports. The rupee has slumped about 16 percent in the past year
against the dollar as the  trade gap  widened, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The fragile global economy doesn’t augur well for Indian
exports,” Rupa Rege Nitsure, an economist at state-owned  Bank
of Baroda (BOB)  in Mumbai, said before the report. “The widening
trade deficit and slowing economic growth pose significant risks
to India’s macroeconomic stability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
