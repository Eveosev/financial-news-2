German Social Democratic leader  Sigmar Gabriel  said Europe needs a growth pact in addition to its
fiscal pact to stop the debt burden from rising,  Welt  reported
in a preview of a story that will run tomorrow, citing Gabriel.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s “pure austerity” plan
has failed, Gabriel said, according to Welt. Europe needs
structural programs, investments in education and industry and
measures to lower youth unemployment, Gabriel told Welt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
