Alan Krueger, chairman of the White
House Council of Economic Advisers, said the  European debt
crisis  poses “some risk” to the U.S. and global economy.  Despite a “rise in some interest rates in some countries”
over recent weeks European nations have made progress in
resolving sovereign debt difficulties, Krueger said today at the
Bloomberg Washington Summit.  “It still looks a lot better than it did last summer,”
Krueger said. “It remains to be the case that the countries in
Europe have the capacity to address the problems.”  Krueger also defended President  Barack Obama ’s record of
working on behalf of U.S. middle-class families.  Real  median   household income  was down $4,300 since Obama
took office in January 2009 and is down $2,900 since the
recovery started in June 2009, according to an estimate from
Sentier Research, an economic-consulting firm based in
Annapolis,  Maryland .  “The most important thing for strengthening the middle
class was to get the recovery going,” Krueger said.  Krueger said the U.S. middle class “hasn’t done very well
for the last 10, 20 years.”  He said it is “a bit premature” to assess the president’s
record on middle-class economic interests because gains income
for middle-income families typically don’t occur early in an
economic expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
