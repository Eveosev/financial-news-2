The amount of tea sold at auction in
Mombasa, which vies with  Sri Lanka  to host the world’s biggest
sale of the leaves, rose 1 percent in the first four months of
the year, Tea Brokers East Africa Ltd. said.  The quantity traded climbed to 113.5 million kilograms (250
million pounds) in the four months through April, from 112.4
million kilograms a year earlier, the Mombasa-based broker said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Sales of Kenyan tea dropped 1.9 percent to 82.8 million
kilograms, it said. Kenya is the world’s largest exporter of the
black variety of the leaves.  The average auction price of tea for the four-month period
dropped by 9 cents to $2.69 per kilogram.  To contact the reporter on this story:
