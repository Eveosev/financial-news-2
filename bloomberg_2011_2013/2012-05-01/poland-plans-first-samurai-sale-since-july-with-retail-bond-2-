Poland  is planning its first yen-
denominated bond sale in the Japanese markets since July with an
offering to retail investors that may yield as much as six times
more than Japanese government debt.  The European nation will offer five-year Samurai notes
yielding between 1.3 percent and 1.7 percent this month,
according to a filing with Japan’s Finance Ministry today.
Japanese  government bonds  offered to individual investors in
March with a similar maturity yielded 0.27 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The sale would be Poland’s first Samurai bond since July,
when it raised 25 billion yen ($313 million) by selling 1.25
percent four-year notes to retail investors, the data show. The
securities were priced to yield 71 basis points more than the
benchmark yen swap rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Relatively it’s an attractive investment” for Japanese
individuals,  Mana Nakazora , chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas
SA in Tokyo, said in a telephone interview. Japanese households
have few options to get higher yields than offered by local
government debt, she said.  Poland will offer the new notes in the second half of May,
with a minimum denomination of 100,000 yen, the filing shows.
Daiwa Securities Group Inc. is arranging the offering, according
to the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
