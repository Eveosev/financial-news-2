Nathan Tinkler ’s Hunter Sports Group
will continue to run the Newcastle Jets A-League team after
resolving its differences with Football Federation Australia.  Billionaire Tinkler’s sports management group said three
weeks ago that it was returning its license 18 months into a 10-
year agreement because of “an irrevocable breakdown in
confidence of the FFA management.” The FFA said it wouldn’t
accept the termination and was considering legal action.  Following a meeting between FFA Chairman  Frank Lowy  and
Tinkler last weekend, the Sydney-based soccer governing body
“made some concessions in good faith in order to resolve the
matters,” Lowy said today in an e-mailed statement.  “My confidence is renewed over Nathan’s personal drive to
make the Jets and the A-League successful,” Lowy added. “We
agreed on a way forward that addresses the issues HSG have
raised and we are now going to get on with developing the game
together in a key region for football.”  The 36-year-old Tinkler, an electrician-turned-miner who is
 Australia ’s youngest billionaire, handed the license back April
10 following a dispute over the size of the acquisition fee he
paid for the Jets and insurance issues around marquee signing
Jason Culina after he suffered a knee injury.  Tinkler had stepped in to rescue the Jets in September 2010
after the FFA withdrew the license of former owner Con
Constantine because the 2008 A-League champion ran out of money
to pay players and stadium fees.  “We now have a way forward and I remain committed to
ensuring the Newcastle Jets is one of the most successful clubs
in the A-League,” Tinkler said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
