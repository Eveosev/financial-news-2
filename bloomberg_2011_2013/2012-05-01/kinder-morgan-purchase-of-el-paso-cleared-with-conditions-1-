Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) ’s purchase of  El
Paso Corp. (EP)  was approved by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on
the condition that the company sells three natural gas pipelines
in the Rocky Mountain region.  The $38 billion transaction as originally proposed would
have hurt competition in several natural gas pipeline
transportation and gas processing markets, the FTC said today in
a statement.  The settlement requires Kinder Morgan to divest its Rockies
Express, Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission and
Trailblazer pipelines, in addition to two gas processing plants
in the Rocky Mountain region, the agency said.  The FTC said its decision is part of its “ongoing efforts
to promote competition in the energy sector.” The sales will
reduce the combined company’s dominance in Rocky Mountain
natural-gas transportation, while allowing the creation of the
biggest U.S. gas pipeline company.  The El Paso purchase is still expected to close in late
May,  Larry Pierce , a Kinder Morgan spokesman, wrote in an e-
mail.  Kinder, based in Houston, said March 15 it had agreed to
the sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
