TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP) , the online travel-
recommendation service spun off from  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  in December,
soared the most in five months after reporting first-quarter
sales and profit that exceeded some analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  climbed 17 percent to $42.63 at the close in New
York, for the biggest gain since Dec. 8. The stock, which is up
69 percent this year, was the top  performer  in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  First-quarter profit excluding certain items was 38 cents a
share, the Newton, Massachusetts-based company said in a
statement yesterday. That compared with an average analyst
projection of 34 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue rose to $183.7 million, topping the $174.4 million
average estimate.  TripAdvisor’s results countered concern that the company’s
profit might be eroded by higher spending on sales and
marketing, Jake Fuller, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets
LLC, wrote in a note after the earnings report.  On a conference call yesterday, Chief Financial Officer
Julie Bradley said the company expects revenue growth for the
year to “trend above the midpoint” of TripAdvisor’s previous
forecast for growth at a percentage in the mid- to high teens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
