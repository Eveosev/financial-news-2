U.S. stocks advanced after a gauge of
manufacturing industries exceeded forecasts, bolstering optimism
in the economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to 1,401.7
at 10:02 a.m. in  New York .  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index rose to
54.8 in April from 53.4 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s report showed today. Economists had forecast a
reading of 53, according to the median estimate in a survey.
Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  The  S&P 500  retreated 0.7 percent in April to halt a four-
month rally, its longest streak in more than two years. The
benchmark gauge for U.S. equities is up 11 percent so far in
2012 and trading about 1.5 percent below an almost four-year
high reached on April 2.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
