QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE) , Australia’s
biggest insurer, hired Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. to sell a 46-acre
(19-hectare) office campus just south of  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s
headquarters near Seattle, the brokerage said.  The property in Bellevue, Washington, encompasses nine
buildings with 326,384 rentable square feet (30,320 square
meters) that are 62 percent occupied, Jones Lang said in a
statement. QBE, based in Sydney, has a 10-year lease for 67,370
square feet in one of the buildings.  The seller is aiming to fetch more than $80 million for the
property, formerly known as the Unigard campus, said a person
with knowledge of the proposed deal, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. Office rents and
occupancies are rising in the region amid hiring by local
employers including  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and  Boeing Co. (BA)   “This offering should receive intense interest from both
institutional investors around the globe, as well as local
development firms,” Ann Chamberlin, a Seattle-based managing
director of Jones Lang, said in the statement.  Bids are expected the week of May 21, she said.  Paula Symons, a spokeswoman for QBE in Sun Prairie,
Wisconsin, declined to comment. QBE’s North American
headquarters is in New York.  QBE shares have fallen 26 percent in the past year amid
record natural disaster claims, including for floods in
Thailand, 19 U.S. tornadoes, earthquakes in New Zealand and
Japan, and Cyclone Yasi in Australia’s Queensland state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
