The number of shoppers visiting
stores in  London  rose in August even after riots in parts of the
city in the early part of the month, according to Springboard,
which monitors footfall across the U.K.  Footfall in London increased 0.9 percent from a year
earlier, with half of the city’s high streets recording an
improvement, Springboard said in an e-mailed statement today.
Nationally, footfall fell 1.5 percent on the year.  Authorities were forced to deploy 16,000 police in the
streets of London by Aug. 9 to prevent a fourth night of rioting
in what was the worst wave of violent disorder since the 1980s.
Prime Minister  David Cameron  returned early from his Italian
vacation and Parliament was recalled to hold an emergency
session on Aug. 11.  “The figures showed an initial dip as the riots struck,”
Diane Wehrle, research director at Springboard, said in the
statement. “But what’s really positive is that by the following
weekend, shoppers were back out in force - even more so than
during the same weekend in 2010.”  During Aug. 6 and Aug. 7, when disorder started in the U.K.
capital, there was a 6.2 percent drop in footfall in London
year-on-year, Springboard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
