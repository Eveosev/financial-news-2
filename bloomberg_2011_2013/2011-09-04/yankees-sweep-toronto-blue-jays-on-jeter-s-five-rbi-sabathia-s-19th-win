The  New York Yankees  beat the
Toronto Blue Jays 9-3 to extend their division lead as  Derek Jeter  matched his career high with five runs batted in and CC Sabathia picked up his 19th win of the season.  Jeter ended a streak of 136 at-bats without a home run by
hitting a three-run shot in the third inning at Yankee Stadium
yesterday. The shortstop added a two-run single in the eighth
inning, giving him five RBIs for the fourth time in his career
and the first since June 18, 2005.  Alex Rodriguez  and Nick Swisher added home runs, while
Sabathia allowed two runs over 7 1/3 innings with 10 strikeouts
as the Yankees completed a three-game series sweep and won for
the seventh time in eight games.  With Boston’s 11-4 loss to the Texas Rangers yesterday, the
Yankees (85-53) pushed their American League East lead to 1 1/2
games over the second-place  Red Sox . It’s the Yankees’ largest
division lead since July 5.  Jeter is batting .346 since returning from the disabled
list on July 4, while Swisher has seven homers in his past 13
games. The Yankees lead  Major League Baseball  with 193 homers
this season.  Sabathia, who improved to 19-7, is the first major-leaguer
to win 19 or more games in three straight seasons since Randy Johnson (2000-02) and the first AL pitcher to do it since Dave Stewart had four consecutive years with 20 or more wins from
1987-90.  Toronto’s Jose Bautista hit his major league-leading 40th
home run in the eighth inning and is the first AL player with
consecutive 40-home run seasons since Boston’s  David Ortiz 
(2004-06).  The Rangers scored seven runs in the sixth inning to pull
away from the Red Sox yesterday at Fenway Park, with Josh Hamilton hitting a three-run triple. Ian Kinsler added a home
run and three RBI for the AL West-leading Rangers, who took two
of three games in the series.  The Arizona Diamondbacks pushed their lead to seven games
in the  National League West  with yesterday’s 4-1 win over the
San Francisco Giants in the finale of their three-game series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
