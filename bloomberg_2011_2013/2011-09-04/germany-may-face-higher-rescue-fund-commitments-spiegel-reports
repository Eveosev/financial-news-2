Germany  may be required to guarantee
at least 250 billion euros ($355 billion) of the European rescue
fund, Der Spiegel  reported  without disclosing the source of the
information.  The German government has accepted a clause that calls for
funds to be increased by 20 percent if needed, the paper said.
Germany has so far committed to backing the fund with 211
billion euros.  Finland may have to accept lower interest rates on money
contributed to the rescue fund in exchange for collateral,
Spiegel reported citing Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders .  To contact the reporter on this story:
