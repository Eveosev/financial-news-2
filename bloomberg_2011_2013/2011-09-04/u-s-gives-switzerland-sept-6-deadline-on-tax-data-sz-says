Switzerland  has until Sept. 6 to
provide the U.S. with data relevant to a criminal investigation
into alleged tax evasion by some clients of  Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN) , SonntagsZeitung reported.  The U.S. is requesting information about accounts held by
thousands of Americans in 10 banks including Credit Suisse, the
Zurich-based newspaper reported, citing correspondence last week
between Michael Ambuehl, the state secretary to the Swiss
finance ministry, and James Cole, the U.S. deputy attorney
general.  Banks may be required to pay up to 2 billion Swiss francs
($2.5 billion) in fines, SonntagsZeitung reported, citing a
separate, unidentified person with knowledge of the situation.
The U.S. may also seek client details from Swiss wealth managers
in addition to the 10 banks, according to the newspaper.  Marc Dosch , a spokesman for Credit Suisse, declined to
comment on the matter by phone today, saying the bank is not
party to inter-governmental negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
