Rafael Nadal  slid off his chair
during a news conference following his straight-set victory
today at the U.S. Open, and said it was because of leg cramps.  “I just have cramping in my leg, that’s all,” Nadal said
in a statement after the interview room was locked for about 10
minutes while trainers and his family attended to him. “That’s
why I fell, it was so painful.”  Nadal, 25, the defending champion and second seed from
 Spain , had needed 2 hours, 39 minutes to defeat David Nalbandian
of Argentina in a match that ended about two hours before he had
the cramps.  “It could have happened anywhere, it was just bad luck it
happened here,” Nadal said in Spanish. He did not take any
questions in English after the cramping.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
