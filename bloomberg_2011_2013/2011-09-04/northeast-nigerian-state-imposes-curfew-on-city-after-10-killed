Nigeria ’s northeastern state of
Bornu imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the city of Biu after 10
people were killed in clashes between security forces and armed
youths on Friday,  Federal Radio Corp. of Nigeria  said yesterday.  Soldiers returned fire after one of them was shot and
killed by a sniper in Borgu village near Biu, some 190
kilometers (118 miles) south of Maiduguri, the Bornu state
capital, Bukar Bulama, a resident of the area, said by phone
yesterday.  Bulama said he counted six dead, including the driver of a
member of the Bornu state House of Assembly, who also sustained
bullet wounds. Abba Shani, a commercial driver, said by phone
yesterday that he saw three dead civilians as he fled from
another part of the city.  Nigerian authorities have blamed Boko Haram, a militant
Islamic sect which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban
movement, for several bomb attacks and killings since last year.
The group has claimed responsibility for the Aug. 26 suicide
car-bomb attack of a  United Nations  building that killed 23
people and wounded 71 in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja.  Hassan Mohammed, an army colonel and spokesman for the
Joint Task Force set up by government to quell religious
extremists in the region, confirmed that an incident occurred.
He declined to provide casualty figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
