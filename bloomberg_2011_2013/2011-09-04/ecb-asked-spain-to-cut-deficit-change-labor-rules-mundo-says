European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  wrote to the Spanish government asking it to
tackle the  budget deficit  and cut unemployment,  El Mundo  said.  As part of the ECB’s plan to buy Spanish bonds on the
secondary market, Trichet asked the government to take steps to
prevent the budget deficit overshooting its target of 6 percent
of gross domestic product this year, El Mundo reported, without
saying where it got the information.  He also urged the administration to carry out another
overhaul of wage bargaining rules to allow for a deeper
correction in Spanish salaries and to make hiring rules more
flexible, the newspaper said.  An ECB spokeswoman, who declined to be named in line with
policy, wouldn’t comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
