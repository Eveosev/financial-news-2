Libya ’s transitional leadership is
ready to send representatives to Moscow for talks on economic
issues,  RIA Novosti  reported, citing comments by  Russia ’s
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.  The Libyan National Transitional Council is interested in
sending officials responsible for economic affairs, Lavrov said
after talks with Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota,
the news service said. Lavrov said Russia was ready to hold
meetings with the Libyan officials, RIA Novosti reported.  Russia stands to lose billions of dollars in deals it
signed with Muammar Qaddafi’s regime, Aram Shegunts, head of the
Arab-Russian Chamber of Industry in Moscow, said on Aug. 23. The
country’s weapons exporters may lose $4 billion in orders,
Sergei Chemezov, head of state-owned Russian Technologies Corp.,
said March 3 after the  United Nations  imposed an arms embargo on
Libya.  Energy companies such as state-run gas exporter OAO Gazprom
and oil producer OAO Tatneft also have hundreds of millions of
dollars invested in Libya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
