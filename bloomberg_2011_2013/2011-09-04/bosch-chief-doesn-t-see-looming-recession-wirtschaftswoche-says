Robert Bosch GmbH  doesn’t see a
pending recession although reactions to exaggerated concerns
might lead to an economic slowdown,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported,

supplier, doesn’t see European governments avoiding joint euro
bonds to address the debt crisis, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
