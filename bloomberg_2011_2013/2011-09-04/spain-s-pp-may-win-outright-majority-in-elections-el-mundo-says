Spain ’s opposition  People’s Party 
would win enough votes to gain a majority of seats in Parliament
if the general election scheduled for Nov. 20 were held now,  El
Mundo  reported, citing a poll.  The PP would win 47.1 percent of the vote, compared with
the Socialists’ 32.3 percent, according to the national poll of
