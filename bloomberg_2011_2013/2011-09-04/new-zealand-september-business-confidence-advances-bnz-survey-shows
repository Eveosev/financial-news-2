New Zealand business confidence rose
this month after slumping to a four-month low in August amid
global financial turmoil, according to a Bank of New Zealand
Ltd. survey of 531 companies in the week ended Sept.2.  The proportion of optimists expecting the economy to be
better in a yearâ€™s time rose to 53 percent from 45 percent in
August, while pessimism dropped to 16 percent from 23 percent,
the Wellington-based lender said in an e-mailed report. The
level of optimism was 59 percent in July.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
