Banks are seeking to retain their
liquidity, making interbank lending more difficult, as funding
from money and capital markets becomes harder to obtain,  ABN
Amro  Group NV Chief Executive Officer Gerrit Zalm said.  Interbank borrowing for more than six months is also
becoming problematic because banks are reluctant to lend to
competitors with “big positions in weaker countries’ debt, for
instance,” he said today on Dutch television program
“Buitenhof.” ABN Amro is “well-capitalized,” he said.  Zalm was Dutch finance minister from 1994 to 2002, during
which time he helped oversee the implementation of the euro
currency and the associated “stability pact” aimed at ensuring
member states adhered to specific budgetary criteria. Germany
and  France  both exceeded those criteria during his later term as
finance minister from 2003 to 2006.  He said today the euro region needs an independent
authority to ensure budget discipline among national
governments. Only when budgetary discipline has been achieved
should the region as a whole consider issuing bonds, he said.  There’s no need at present to increase the European
Financial Stability Facility to calm financial markets as long
as government leaders show sufficient willingness to expand the
rescue fund should that need arise, he said.  A demise of the euro would have “catastrophic”
consequences for the Dutch economy, which sends about three-
fourths of its exports to other euro-zone states, and  “would
cause a recession that would make the 1930s a trifle by
comparison,” Zalm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
