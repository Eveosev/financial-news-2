Repsol YPF SA (REP)  Chairman Antonio Brufau has received “unconditional support” from shareholder
 La Caixa  amid efforts by two other stakeholders to restructure
the Spanish oil company’s management,  El Pais  reported, citing
unidentified people.  La Caixa, which controls 12.8 percent of Repsol, wants to
defend the current set-up after  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) , the
largest shareholder, and  Petroleos Mexicanos  signed an investor
pact to push for changes in the management structure, El Pais
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
