Gold prices climbed above platinum
prices as concern about a global economic slowdown boosted
demand for a haven and eroded the outlook for a metal used
mainly in autocatalysts.  Spot gold traded at $1,889.57 an ounce, while cash platinum
was at $1,887.50 an ounce by 6:35 a.m. Singapore time. Gold
futures in  New York  were at $1,892.70 an ounce, while platinum
futures were at $1,891.90 an ounce at the same time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
