Former Vice President  Dick Cheney 
said he told his boss, George W. Bush, to keep military options
against Iran “on the table,” stopping short of recommending a
strike against the nation’s nuclear program.  Cheney told the “Fox News Sunday” program that the Bush
administration was “not as effective in the second term” at
dealing with nuclear-proliferation issues, including programs in
Iran and North Korea. Cheney said his own clout “was
diminished” in the second term, and Bush overruled some of his
recommendations.  Bush decided against attacking a Syrian nuclear reactor in
2007, against Cheney’s advice, he said, and instead opted “to
pursue a diplomatic solution.” The Israeli government “found
that unacceptable” and destroyed the reactor in an airstrike in
September of that year, Cheney said.  Cheney said he didn’t address in his new book, “In My
Time,” whether he ever recommended a strike against  Iran .  “We never got to the point where I said, ‘I think we need
to launch a strike against the Iranian program,’” he said. “I
was always advising to keep that option on the table.”  Cheney appeared on the Fox News program to discuss his
memoir, in which he criticizes  Colin Powell , Bush’s first
secretary of state, and Condoleezza Rice, the former national
security adviser and second secretary of state.  Powell has said Cheney took a “cheap shot” at him in his
book, and Rice said her former colleague attacked her integriy.
Cheney denied both charges. “Obviously, I disagree with him,”
Cheney said, referring to Powell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
