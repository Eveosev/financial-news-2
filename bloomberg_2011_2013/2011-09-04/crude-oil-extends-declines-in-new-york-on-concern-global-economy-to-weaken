Crude oil fell to the lowest level
in more than a week on speculation that slowing economic growth
in the U.S. and  China  will crimp fuel consumption in the world’s
two biggest crude users.  Futures fell as much as 3.4 percent after a Chinese
services index published today fell to a record low in August. A
report tomorrow may say U.S. service industries grew at the
slowest pace in more than a year. Crude also declined as Exxon
Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. returned workers to some oil and
natural gas platforms after Tropical Depression Lee moved out of
the Gulf of Mexico.  “There’s no impetus to break higher,” said  Tobias Merath ,
head of commodities research at Credit Suisse AG in Zurich, who
expects oil to trade in a range of $80 to $90 a barrel this
month. “There has been a deterioration in the economic
indicators and problems on the funding side. When you have that
combination, it can be pretty nasty for the market.”  Crude for October delivery fell $2.85, or 3.3 percent, to
$83.60 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange at 2:37 p.m., after dropping as much as $2.95 to
$83.50, the lowest price since Aug. 26.  There is no Nymex floor trading today because of the Labor
Day holiday.  Employment, Services  Brent oil for October settlement decreased $2.28, or 2
percent, to $110.08 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark was at a premium of $26.48 to
U.S. futures, compared with a record close of $26.21 on Aug. 19
and an intraday record of $26.97 on Sept. 2.  Oil also slid as stocks declined amid signs European
policymakers are struggling to resolve the region’s debt crisis.
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party lost weekend elections
in her home state, stoking concern opposition is growing to
bailouts for debt-saddled European nations.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing
index fell to 51 last month, the lowest since January 2010, from
52.7 in July, according to the median of 59 forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey before a Sept. 6 release. Citigroup Inc.
cut its 2011 global economic growth forecast today to 3.1
percent from 3.7 percent.  A purchasing managers’ index in China, the world’s second
biggest crude consumer, dropped to 50.6 from 53.5 in July. The
reading, near the borderline of 50 that marks expansion or
contraction, was the lowest since the series began in November
2005, according to a statement issued by HSBC Holdings Plc.  Labor Report  On Sept. 2, crude in New York fell $2.48 after the Labor
Department said U.S. payrolls were unchanged last month, the
weakest reading since September 2010.  In the  Gulf of Mexico , Lee weakened from a tropical storm
to a depression after making landfall and soaking  Louisiana  and
much of the nearby  Gulf Coast .  About 61 percent of oil production and 46 percent of
natural gas output from the Gulf has been shut in because of the
storm, according to the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ,
Regulation and Enforcement.  About 858,935 barrels of oil per day have been curtailed,
the bureau said today on its website. That compares with 843,223
barrels yesterday. About 2.44 billion cubic feet of gas per day
have been shut in, compared with 2.35 billion yesterday.  Personnel have been evacuated from 232 platforms, or 38
percent of the manned platforms in the Gulf. Companies have
taken employees from 24 rigs, or 34 percent of the rigs
operating in the Gulf.  Lee’s Location  Lee was about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north-northeast of
 New Orleans , with remnants of the storm moving east-northeast at
14 miles per hour, the NHC said in an  advisory  at 10:00 central
time.  Crews are restoring production in the Gulf, David Eglinton,
a spokesman for  Exxon Mobil , based in Irving,  Texas , said today
in an e-mail. Chevron has begun to redeploy workers in the
region, according to a company statement posted online today.  BP Plc said it will return workers early tomorrow,
according to a company phone message.  Hedge funds  boosted bullish bets on New York oil by the
most since March last week as  Hurricane Irene  took aim at the
U.S. East Coast, threatening imports, pipelines and refineries.
The funds and other large speculators increased wagers that
prices will rise by 13 percent in the week ended Aug. 30,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Sept. 2
Commitments of Traders report.  Speculative bets by money managers that  Brent crude  will
rise increased by 48 percent in the same period, according to
data from ICE Futures  Europe . Net-long positions rose by 20,942
contracts from 43,489 a week earlier, the exchange said today in
its weekly Commitment of Traders report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
