Japan  will take decisive action
against speculative moves in the foreign-exchange markets if
needed, Finance Minister Jun Azumi said today on public
broadcaster NHK’s “Sunday Debate” program.  Azumi said he will take the same kind of steps as Prime
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  did while he was finance minister.  Noda oversaw Japan’s biggest currency intervention in seven
years last month as finance minister as the yen soared to a
postwar high against the dollar of 75.95. The Group of Seven
nations’ finance ministers and central bankers are due to meet
in Marseilles, France, this week as global policy makers
struggle to sustain an economic rebound from the 2008 recession.  “We are concerned about persistent one-sided gains in the
yen,” Azumi said. “I will tell the G-7 that a strengthening
yen may slow Japan’s economic growth.”  Japan’s large manufacturers base their business plans for
this fiscal year on an assumption that the yen will average
82.59 per dollar, according to the Bank of Japan’s quarterly
 Tankan survey  released on July 1. The yen closed at 76.80
against the U.S. currency on Sept. 2 and has averaged 80.11
against the dollar since Japan’s fiscal year began on April 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
