A senior lawmaker in the Liberal
Democrats, U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s coalition
partners, said she still has “huge concerns” about a bill to
overhaul the  National Health Service .  Shirley Williams, a member of the upper House of Lords,
wrote in an article in the Observer newspaper that the battle
over the proposed legislation, which has already been delayed
and rewritten, is “far from over.”  The bill is due to be debated in the lower House of Commons
on Sept. 6 and Williams’s comments raise the possibility that
Liberal Democrat lawmakers may vote against it, depriving the
government of a majority.  Political leaders in Britain have been “bewitched” by the
idea of introducing a U.S.-style competitive market into the
health system, Williams wrote, explaining her opposition to
plans for greater private-sector involvement in the NHS.  To contact the reporters on this story:
