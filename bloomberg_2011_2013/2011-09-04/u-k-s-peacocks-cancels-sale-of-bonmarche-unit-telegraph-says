Peacocks, a U.K. clothing retailer,
canceled plans to sell its Bonmarche chain, while administrators
delayed the sale of Aurum Holdings, which runs British jewelry
business Goldsmiths, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  The decisions came amid a slowdown in  consumer spending ,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources. Peacocks had
hired DC Advisory to help it with the planned disposal of
Bonmarche, according to the report.  Administrators of Aurum, owned previously by failed
Icelandic bank Landsbanki Islands HF, postponed Arum’s sale
until 2012, the Sunday Telegraph said. Aurum said in April it
had hired Cavendish Corporate Finance as an adviser on the sale.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
