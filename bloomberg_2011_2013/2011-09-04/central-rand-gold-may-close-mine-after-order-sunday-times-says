Central Rand Gold Ltd. (CRD) , a South
African producer of the metal, may have to close its mine as
early as next week after a government order, the  Sunday Times 
reported, citing Bheki Khumalo, spokesman for the Department of
Mineral Resources.  Central Rand Gold breached certain rules related to its
mining rights at the mine near Soweto, Johannesburg, the
Johannesburg-based weekly newspaper said, citing a notice sent
to the company by Mining Minister Susan Shabangu.  The order doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the mine will close this
week, Khumalo said by phone in response to a query by Bloomberg
News. A shutdown will depend on a number of factors, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
