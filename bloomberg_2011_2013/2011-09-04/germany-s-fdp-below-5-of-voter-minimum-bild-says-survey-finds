The Free Democratic Party,
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s coalition partner, has the support of
less than 5 percent of voters, according to a weekly survey by
 Bild  and the Emnid research group.  Just 4 percent of German voters would chose the FDP, less
than the threshold needed for representation in Germany’s
parliament, the newspaper said.  The Green Party increased its support by 1 percent to 21
percent, and the  Christian Democratic Union  was stable at 32
percent and the Social Democrats at 28 percent, Bild reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
