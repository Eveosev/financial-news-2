Denmark’s  Thomas Bjorn  hit a 9-
under-par 62 in the final round of the Omega European Masters to
claim a second straight title on golf’s European Tour.  The 40-year-old, whose round included an eagle, nine
birdies and two bogeys, finished on 20-under at Crans-sur-
Sierre, Switzerland.   Germany’s  Martin Kaymer  was four shots back, with Jaco van
Zyl of South Africa, Northern Ireland’sRory McIlroy and Jamie
Donaldson of Wales on 15-under.  Bjorn was three shots behind overnight leader Donaldson
heading into the final round, the same margin he overturned to
win the Johnnie Walker Championship last week. He needed a
playoff to take the Johnnie Walker title.  Bjorn also won the Qatar Masters this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
