MAN SE may consider unwinding the
sale of its 30 percent stake in Ferrostaal to International
Petroleum Investment Co. because of a dispute over compensation
for a bribery scandal,  Der Spiegel   reported , citing an
unidentified MAN manager.  MAN has balked at IPIC’s demand for money to cover business
risks, the magazine said. The Munich-based truckmaker has
offered to waive the 130 million euros ($185 million) for the
remaining stake in Ferrostaal and is willing to pay 180 million
euros in penalties and 80 million euros in lawyers fees and
investigation costs, Spiegel reported.  Andreas Lampersbach, a spokesman for MAN, said the company
doesn’t comment on “speculation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
