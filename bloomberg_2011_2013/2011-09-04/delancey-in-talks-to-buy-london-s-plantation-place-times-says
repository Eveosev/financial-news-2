Delancey Estates Plc, an  investment
company  led by Jamie Ritblat, may buy  London ’s Plantation Place
office building in a transaction valuing the property at 500
million pounds ($1.6 billion), the  Sunday Times  said.  Ritblat, whose father oversaw the construction of
Plantation Place, is in exclusive talks with owners of the
building and would team up with Scottish Widows Investment
Partnership for a purchase, the London-based newspaper said,
without saying how it obtained the information.  The property investor failed with an earlier and lower bid,
and with a previous attempt to buy the building by purchasing
loans secured to it, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
