Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  is
maintaining its 2011 targets and doesnâ€™t see any impact on
demand from concern about an economic slowdown,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  reported, citing an interview with
Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner.  BMW sales in August rose almost 7 percent to a record of
more than 100,000 vehicles and factories are booked for months,
the newspaper said.  BMW wants to sell more than 1.6 million autos this year and
achieve an operating profit from carmaking equal to at least 10
percent of revenue, FAS reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
