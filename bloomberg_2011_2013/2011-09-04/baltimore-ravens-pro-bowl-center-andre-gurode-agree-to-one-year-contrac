The  New England Patriots  signed
former Pro Bowl offensive guard Brian Waters, while the
 Baltimore Ravens  agreed to terms on a one-year contract with Pro
Bowl center Andre Gurode.  The Chicago Bears yesterday agreed to terms on a one-year
deal with Pro Bowl safety Brandon Meriweather, who was released
a day before by the Patriots.  The 6-foot-3, 320-pound Waters joins New England after
spending the past 11 National Football League seasons with
Kansas City and making four Pro Bowl appearances. He was
released by the Chiefs in July.  Gurode was cut by  Dallas  last week after nine seasons with
the Cowboys. The 6-foot-4, 318-pound offensive lineman gives the
Ravens an experienced backup for starting center Matt Birk, a
seven-time Pro Bowl selection who is recovering after
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee last month.  Meriweather becomes the sixth player on the Bearsâ€™ roster
who was drafted in the first round by another team, joining  Jay Cutler , Julius Peppers, Roy Williams, Chris Spencer and Amobi
Okoye. Meriweather, 27, was the 24th overall pick of the
Patriots in the 2007 draft and made the Pro Bowl the past two
seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
