U.K. Prime Minister will seek a
“significant watering down” of a planned overhaul in banking
regulations because the new rules may hurt growth and spur
lenders to quit the country, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  Cameron told senior cabinet officials that any proposals
from the Independent Commission on Banking to split banks’
retail and investment units or require lenders to raise capital
must be reviewed, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified
officials. The government is concerned that  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) 
and possibly other banks may move operations away from the U.K.
if planned “ring-fencing” rules are implemented, according to
the Sunday Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
