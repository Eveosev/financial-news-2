Economiesuisse, the Zurich-based
business lobby, wants the  Swiss National Bank  to introduce a
 euro  exchange rate target to tackle the appreciation of the
Swiss currency,  SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing Gerold Buehrer,
head of the association.  The target may initially be 1.1 francs to 1.15 francs per
euro, SonntagsZeitung said. A rate of 1.2 francs per euro makes
rational economic sense for Swiss companies, Buehrer was cited
as saying in the Zurich-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
