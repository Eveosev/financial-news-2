Private-equity fund HgCapital called
off plans to sell Americana International Ltd., the U.K. owner
of the Bench and Hooch fashion brands, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, citing people close to the matter it didnâ€™t identify.  Americana is no longer being actively marketed to potential
buyers, the newspaper said. HgCapital had hired NM Rothschild &
