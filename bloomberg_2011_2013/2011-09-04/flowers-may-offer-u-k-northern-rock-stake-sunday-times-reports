JC Flowers & Co., the private-equity
firm bidding for Northern Rock Plc, may offer the U.K.
government a shareholding in the vehicle it might use to acquire
the lender, the  Sunday Times  reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  JC Flowers may use OneSavings Bank Plc to acquire Northern
Rock and offer shares in OneSavings to the government, enabling
it to hold stakes in other lenders owned by the company, the
newspaper said.  The U.K. may lose at least 400 million pounds ($648.7
million) from the Northern Rock sale, the Times reported, citing
unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
