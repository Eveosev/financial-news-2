China  will tighten rules on
subsidies for energy-saving vehicles made by local automakers,
according to a government official. Cars will qualify for a
subsidy if they have an average fuel consumption of 6.3 liters
of gasoline or lower per 100 kilometers, Xiang Dihai, a director
at the department of Economic Construction at the Ministry of
Finance, said in an interview today in Tianjin. The current
threshhold is 6.9 liters per 100 kilometers.  The subsidy will remain at 3,000 yuan per vehicle, Xiang
said. The  finance ministry  and the National Development and
Reform Commission will announce the policy change “soon” on
their websites, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
