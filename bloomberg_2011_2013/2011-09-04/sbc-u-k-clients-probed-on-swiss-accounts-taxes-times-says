The U.K. tax agency is investigating
almost 800 British holders of  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  accounts in
Switzerland on suspicion of  tax fraud , the Sunday Times said.  The tax situation of more clients is likely to be probed as
the agency examines records of 7,000 customers stolen by a
former HSBC employee in Switzerland, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified accountants and officials at HM Revenue & Customs.  Clients in recent months have received a letter notifying
them they are “suspected of serious tax fraud,” the Times
said. The probe may raise hundreds of millions of pounds in
revenue, the newspaper said.  Those affected cannot benefit from the recent offshore tax
agreement between the U.K. and Switzerland, the newspaper added.
The Times cited HSBC as saying the bank doesn’t condone  tax
evasion  and seeks to comply with the law in all countries it
operates in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
