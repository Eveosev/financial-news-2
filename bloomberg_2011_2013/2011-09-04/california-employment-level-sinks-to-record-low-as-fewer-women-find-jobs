The percentage of working-age
Californians with jobs has fallen to a record low, and
employment may not return to pre-recession levels until the
second half of the decade, according to a research group.  Just 55.4 percent of working-age Californians, defined as
those 16 or older, had a job in July, down from 56.2 percent a
year earlier and the lowest level since 1976, the Sacramento-
based  California Budget Project  said in a report released late
yesterday.  California’s 12 percent unemployment rate in July, the
nation’s second-highest after  Nevada , compared with 9.1 percent
nationwide. The most-populous state lost 1.4 million jobs during
the recession that began three years ago, and has gained back
only 226,800, or about 17 percent, according to the report.  Alissa Anderson, deputy director of the research group,
which concentrates on issues facing low- and middle-class
Californians, said women have disproportionately trailed men in
regaining jobs.  “Women represent nearly half of the workforce,” Anderson
said in a telephone interview. “They gained just one of the 10
jobs added.”  Job losses in local government, health care and other
industries where women make up a large portion of the workforce
contributed to the weak employment picture. Women have lost jobs
in industries such as retail and financial services, while men
in those fields gained.  “As businesses cut costs, the first thing to go is
administrative support positions where women tend to work,”
Anderson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
