Shares of the following companies

day of declines and its biggest retreat since Aug. 19.  Brokerages: Daewoo Securities Co. (006800 KS) fell 6.8

Samsung Securities Co. (016360 KS) dropped 6.7 percent to 58,100
won. The brokerages retreated on concern a stock-market slump
will curb share trading.  “Whenever there’s a big drop in markets, speculation that
investors sentiment will weaken and trading volume and value
will drop weighs on brokerage stocks,” said Son Mi Ji, an
analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.  Refiners: SK Innovation Co. (096770 KS) tumbled 11 percent
to 146,000 won, falling for a third day.  GS Holdings (078930)  Corp.

(010950 KS) lost 11 percent to 105,500 won. Oil declined for a
second day in  New York  as investors speculated that signs the
Chinese and U.S. economies are weakening indicate fuel demand
will falter in the world’s biggest crude-consuming nations.  Poongsan Corp. (103140 KS), a copper-products maker, sank
7.7 percent to 38,650 won. Copper futures in  London  declined for
a third day.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930 KS) lost 4.9 percent to
731,000 won, its biggest loss since Aug. 18. The company lost a
