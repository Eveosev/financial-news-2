The average annual bonus for
directors of companies in the U.K.’s benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) 
soared 187 percent over the past 10 years even as share prices
fell, according to a report by the  High Pay Commission .  Directors’ salaries increased by 64 percent over the
decade, while the average year-end share price of FTSE 100
companies declined by 71 percent over the same period, the
commission, a pressure group that pushes for curbs on top
earners, said in the report published in London today.  “The evidence exposes the myth that big bonuses and high
salaries result in better company performances,” Deborah
Hargreaves, who heads the commission, said in an e-mailed
statement. “There has been massive growth in what has been
termed as performance-related pay, yet no such corresponding
leap forward in company performance.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
