Global funds added to holdings of
 South Korea ’s local-currency bonds for a seventh month in August
while trimming ownership of the nation’s shares, the financial
markets watchdog said.  Debt held by international investors increased by a net 134
billion won ($126 million) to a record 84.7 trillion won at the
end of last month, the  Financial Supervisory Service  said in an
e-mailed statement today. Funds based in the U.S. were the
biggest buyers, with their ownership increasing by 1 trillion
won. Investors in Luxembourg, Thailand and China followed those
in the U.S. as the largest holders of won notes.  Global investors sold 5.9 trillion won more of the nation’s
stocks than they bought in August, the biggest amount of net
sales since May 2010. The outflows from equities followed
lingering concerns about  Europe ’s debt crisis and the strength
of the  U.S. economy , the watchdog said.  The won fell 1.2 percent last month and the Kospi Index
slid 11.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
