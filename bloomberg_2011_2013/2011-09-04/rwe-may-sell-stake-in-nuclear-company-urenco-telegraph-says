RWE AG (RWE)  has appointed advisers to
review its stake in Urenco, a nuclear power company the German
utility owns with the U.K. and Dutch governments and rival EON
AG, the  Sunday Telegraph  said, citing an unidentified person
with knowledge of the situation.  Any disposal of the stake in the operator of uranium-
enriching plants must be approved by the other shareholders and
may prompt the U.K. to consider a sale of its stake, the
newspaper said.  Annett Urbaczka, a spokeswoman for RWE, declined to comment
when contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
