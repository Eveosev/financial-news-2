Charter International Plc (CHTR)  Chairman
Lars Emilson said top shareholders thwarted a better sale of the
British engineering company as they added pressure to complete a
deal, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  “We could have got a better price if some shareholders had
not pressed us to do a deal so early,” Emilson was quoted as
saying by the  newspaper .  Charter is in final negotiations to be sold to  Melrose Plc (MRO) 
in a deal that values it at 1.44 billion pounds ($2.34 billion),
the Telegraph reported. Charter was working on luring a
competing bid when investors including Schroders Plc and Aviva
Plc threatened to call an extraordinary shareholder meeting if
Charter didn’t open its books to Melrose, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
