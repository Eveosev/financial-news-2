International Monetary Fund Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  called on  Europe  and the U.S. to
consider stimulating growth to avoid a recession,  Der Spiegel
 reported.  “Measures need to be undertaken to avert the threat of a
downward spiral,” Lagarde told the magazine in an interview,
according to an advance released today. “If various
governments, international organizations and central banks work
together, we will avoid recession.”  Lagarde said the U.S. should consider suspending short-term
savings plans to boost growth, while Germany could encourage
domestic demand to reduce its reliance on exports and help
neighboring countries, the weekly magazine reported.  Lagardere also called for European banks to be
recapitalized, Spiegel reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
