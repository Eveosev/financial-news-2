The  Pacific-12  Conference is
discussing adding four schools,  including the University of
Oklahoma  and the  University of Texas ,  ESPN reported , citing an
unidentified person close to the situation.  Texas Tech  and  Oklahoma State  may also join the conference,
the report said.  Oklahoma and Oklahoma State pledged their futures to the
 Big 12  in June 2010, shortly after Texas passed on a move to the
Pac-10, as it was then called. Texas decided against a change
after Big 12 Commissioner Dan Beebe agreed to allow the
Longhorns to set up and profit from their own  television
network . Texas couldn’t retain the network if it joins the Pac-
12, ESPN said, citing Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott.  The University of Colorado and the University of Utah this
year joined the Pac-12, which in May signed a 12-year, $3
billion television contract with  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN and  News
Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox network. The largest rights package for a college
sports league includes football and basketball games and some
Olympic sports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
