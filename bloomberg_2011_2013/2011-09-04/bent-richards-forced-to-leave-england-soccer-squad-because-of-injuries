Striker  Darren Bent  and defender
 Micah Richards  returned to their clubs today after suffering
injuries that rule them out of the 2012 European Championship
qualifier against  Wales  in two days.  Aston Villa’s Bent has been unable to train, while
 Manchester City ’s Richards picked up an injury yesterday,
English soccer’s Football Association said in a  statement  on its
website.  There will be no replacements added to the squad. Neither
Bent or Richards played in  England ’s 3-0 win against  Bulgaria  on
Sept. 2.  England leads Group G with 14 points from six games, three
points ahead of Montenegro. Both teams have two games remaining,
with only the top team guaranteed a spot at next year’s
championship in Poland and Ukraine.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
