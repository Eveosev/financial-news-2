Funds increased bullish bets on
agricultural commodities by the most in more than a year on
signs of tightening supplies amid adverse weather conditions.  In the week ended Aug. 30, speculators raised their net-
long positions in 11 commodities by 18 percent to 915,341
futures and options contracts, government data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That was the biggest gain since Aug. 3, 2010.
Holdings in wheat more than tripled, bullish corn bets reached
an 11-week high, and soybean positions jumped to the highest
since November 2010.  Corn prices have jumped 70 percent in the past year and
soybeans have gained 43 percent. The hottest July since 1955
means that U.S. production of both crops may miss government
estimates, according to researcher and broker INTL FCStone Inc.
The costliest drought in Texas history has hampered U.S.
supplies of cotton, while dry weather in the U.S. Great Plains
may curb planting of winter wheat.  “You still have some pretty explosive supply and demand
situations” for U.S. crops, said James Dailey, who manages $215
million at TEAM Financial Management LLC in Harrisburg,
 Pennsylvania . “There was a liquidation that went on because of
the financial panic, and now some people are waking up and
saying things are still pretty extreme in terms of the risks if
there are supply disruptions.”  ‘Exceptional’ Drought  Parts of southern  Kansas  and western  Oklahoma  have had less
than half of the normal  rainfall  this year, according to the
 National Weather Service , and more than 81 percent of Texas is
in  “exceptional”  drought, U.S. Drought Monitor data show.
About 54 percent of the U.S. corn crop was in good or excellent
condition as of Aug. 28, the lowest for any week since September
2005, government data show.  “Mother Nature’s been in a real bad mood this year, and we
don’t see an attitude adjustment anytime soon,” Ron Lawson, a
managing director at Logic Advisors, a commodity consultant in
Sonoma,  California , said in a telephone interview on Sept. 2.
“Harvest time is going to be challenged by weather.”  On Sept. 2, wheat futures for December delivery rose 14.5
cents, or 1.9 percent, to settle at $7.755 a bushel on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade. Corn futures for December delivery
climbed 21.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to close at $7.60 a bushel
in Chicago. Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 11.25
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $14.4575 a bushel on the CBOT.  18 Commodities  A broader measure showed that funds also increased their
net-long positions in 18 commodities by 15 percent to 1.27
million futures and options contracts, data from U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission show. That’s the biggest gain since
July 19. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw
materials rose 0.6 percent last week, the second straight gain.  Investors pulled $581 million from commodity funds in the
week ended Aug. 31, the third straight week of outflows,
following four weeks of inflows, according to EPFR Global, a
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research company.  The withdrawals were “people trying to avoid getting
caught in the pullback of  gold prices ,”  Cameron Brandt , EPFR’s
director of research, said in a telephone interview on Sept. 2.
“Most of the outflows came from funds geared from gold and
precious metals.”  Speculators cut positions in gold by 2.9 percent to 195,372
contracts, the fourth straight drop, government data show.
Holdings are at the lowest in eight weeks. Prices have fallen
2.1 percent since touching a record $1,917.90 an ounce on Aug.
23 in New  York.  All U.S. markets and government offices are closed today,
in observance of Labor Day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
