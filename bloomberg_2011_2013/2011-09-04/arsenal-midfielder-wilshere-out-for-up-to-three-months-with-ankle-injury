Arsenal midfielder  Jack Wilshere 
said he’ll be sidelined for as long as three more months with an
ankle injury sustained in pre-season.  “I’m gutted but I’ll be back stronger,” the 19-year-old
England international said on his Twitter account, with the
comments reproduced on the club’s website. “I’m working hard in
the gym to stay fit.”  Arsenal failed to win its opening three matches in English
soccer’s Premier League this season, including an 8-2 defeat to
defending champion  Manchester United .  The Gunners sold Samir Nasri and Cesc Fabregas last month
and have been without midfielders including Abou Diaby because
of injury. Alex Song and Emmanuel Frimpong have both had to
serve suspensions.  Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  last week signed midfielders
Mikel Arteta from Everton and Yossi Benayoun on loan from
Chelsea. Defenders Per Mertesacker and Andre Santos, and striker
Park Chu-Young also arrived before European soccer’s transfer
deadline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
