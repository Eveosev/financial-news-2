Phil Mickelson  surged up the
leaderboard with an 8-under-par 63 during the third round of
golf’s Deutsche Bank Championship.  Mickelson’s bogey-free round leaves him at 7-under par,
three shots behind halfway leaders Bubba Watson,  Charl Schwartzel  and  Adam Scott , who have yet to begin their rounds at
the TPC Boston in Norton, Massachusetts.  Mickelson moved into a tie for sixth place after beginning
the day in 61st, having qualified for the weekend rounds by
finishing on the cut mark of 1-over par yesterday.  The Deutsche Bank Championship is the second of four
playoff events on the U.S. PGA Tour. The top 70 players in the
FedEx Cup rankings advance to the BMW Championship, with 30
moving on from there to the season-ending Tour Championship. The
FedEx Cup winner receives a $10 million bonus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
