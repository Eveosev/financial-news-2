India  has paid Iran $5 billion for
oil shipments, clearing months of overdue debt, the  Islamic
Republic News Agency  reported, citing Iranian Central Bank
Governor Mahmoud Bahmani.  India will continue to pay for ongoing crude oil supplies
from Iran, the official news agency said, citing Bahmani.  Indian refiners said banks were unwilling to transfer
payments for oil purchases because of international sanctions
against Iran over the country’s nuclear program.  India resolved the financial impasse with Iran, India’s
Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in parliament on Aug. 12
without providing details.  Iran is the second-largest oil producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries after  Saudi Arabia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
