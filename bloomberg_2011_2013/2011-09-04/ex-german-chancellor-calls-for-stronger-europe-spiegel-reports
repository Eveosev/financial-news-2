Gerhard Schroeder , the former German
chancellor, called for deeper European integration and supports
a drive for a closer union of European states,  Der Spiegel 
reported, citing an interview.  The current crisis shows that  Europe  needs stronger
institutions, including a joint finance minister and budgetary
powers transferred to the European parliament, the magazine
reported. Schroeder also criticized the U.K.’s efforts to form
economic policy in the European Union even though it’s not part
of the euro area, Spiegel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
