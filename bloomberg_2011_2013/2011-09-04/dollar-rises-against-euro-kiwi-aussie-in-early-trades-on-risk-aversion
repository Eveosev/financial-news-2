The  U.S. dollar  advanced against the
euro, the Australian and New Zealand currencies, extending gains
from last week that had come amid concern Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis will worsen.  The dollar climbed to $1.4167 per euro in early Asia-
Pacific trading from $1.4205 at the end of last week in New 
York, and rose to 76.87 yen from 76.80 yen. The greenback 
strengthened against the  New Zealand dollar  to 84.44 cents from 
84.81 cents and advanced to $1.0617 per Australian dollar from 
$1.0645.  The euro fell last week versus most peers as the premium
European banks pay to borrow in dollars through the swaps market
increased to the most since May 2010, a sign of concern that
officials in the region are struggling to contain the fiscal
crisis.  The  euro  slid 4.2 percent to 1.1201 francs in the five days
ended Sept. 2, the biggest decline since the 17-nation
currency’s debut in 1999. The euro was down 2 percent last week
to $1.4205.  To contact the reporter on this story:
