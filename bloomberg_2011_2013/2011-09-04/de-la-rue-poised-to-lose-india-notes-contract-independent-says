De La Rue Plc (DLAR)  probably will lose a
state contract in India as the nation’s government is set to
announce a new group of printers for its banknotes, the
 Independent on Sunday  reported.  Giesecke & Devrient GmbH,  Fortress Paper Ltd. (FTP)  and
Arjowiggins SAS are favorites to split the contract, the
newspaper said, citing unidentified persons.  Any decision would be made by the finance ministry, Reserve
Bank of India spokeswoman Alpana Killawala in Mumbai said when
contacted by Bloomberg News for comment. D.S. Malik, a spokesman
for the finance ministry in New Delhi, declined to comment.  Separately, Francois-Charles Oberthur Fiduciaire SA, a
French maker of smartcards, is said to be considering reviving a
bid for De La Rue, although the group is also weighing moves on
other potential targets, the newspaper reported, without saying
how it got the information.  Officials at Basingstoke, England-based De La Rue weren’t
immediately reachable for comment outside of normal business
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
