Prime Minister  David Cameron  said
“nothing should be taboo” as the government considers extra
measures this fall to boost Britain’s flagging economic growth.  “We haven’t gone far enough,” Cameron wrote in an article
for today’s Mail on Sunday newspaper. “My order to Whitehall
this autumn is to think even more boldly about what we can do to
put the turbo-boosters on Britain’s economy.”  The government will if necessary tackle lobby groups “that
are defending every last bit of the regulation that crushes
business,” Cameron wrote. “And yes, if it means putting even
more pressure on the banks so they lend more to small
businesses, then we’ll do that too.”  U.K. economic growth slowed to 0.2 percent in the second
quarter and the  Bank of England  cut its growth projections last
month to about 1.5 percent this year and 2.2 percent in 2012.
Banks have warned that implementation of any proposals to be
made next week by the government-appointed Independent
Commission on Banking to strengthen lenders’ financial positions
should be postponed because of the faltering recovery.  To contact the reporters on this story:
