Russia  has “enough” vegetables to
meet domestic demand without imports from the European Union,
Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  said.  The 27-nation union accounted for 11 percent of Russia’s
tomato imports and 5 percent of its cucumber imports in 2010,
she said, according to a statement on the ministry website dated
yesterday. More than 70 percent of Russian imports come between
January and April, Skrynnik said.  Russia banned imports of fresh vegetables from the EU
after an E.coli outbreak in Germany. The EU is seeking an
immediate withdrawal of  the ban.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
