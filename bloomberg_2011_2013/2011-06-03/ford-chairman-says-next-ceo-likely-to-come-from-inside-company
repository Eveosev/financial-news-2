Ford Motor Co. (F)  Chief Executive
Officer  Alan Mulally , who has said he has no plans to retire,
likely will be replaced by an executive inside the company when
he does decide to step down, Executive Chairman  Bill Ford  said.  “I really like our inside talent,” Ford told reporters
today at an event on Mackinac Island in  Michigan . “It would be
very unusual if we didn’t pick somebody from the inside.”  Mulally, 65, joined Ford from Boeing Co. in 2006 and helped
turn the automaker around by revamping its model lineup with a
focus on quality and fuel-efficiency. He said at Ford’s annual
meeting last month that he planned to stay with the automaker as
it works to regain its investment-grade  credit rating .  Mulally holds “Business Performance Review” meetings with
about 15 top executives on Thursdays that are helping “train
the next generation,” Ford said. The gatherings encourage
executives to learn about and become involved in all facets of
the company, rather than remaining in their own areas, Ford
said.  “Everybody in the meeting has access to all the
information, all the issues facing the company,” Ford said.
“It will be a much better trained group of executives when Alan
does decide to leave.”  Ford fell 17 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $14.01 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
dropped 17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
