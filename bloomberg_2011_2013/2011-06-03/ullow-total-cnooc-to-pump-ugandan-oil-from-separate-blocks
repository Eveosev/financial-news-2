Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and its two partners
 Total SA (FP)  and China National Offshore Oil Corp. will each pump
oil from a separate block, Tullow’s Ugandan unit said.  The oil from the three blocks owned by the partnership will
be fed into a single refinery for processing, Elly Karuhanga,
the president of Tullow’s Ugandan unit said in an interview
yesterday.  “Since we have three blocks each company will be assigned a
block from which to produce the oil,” he said without giving
details.  Tullow is an equal partner with Total and CNOOC to which it
sold shares in its Ugandan interests in March. The company is
expected to start pumping crude and gas from the Lake Albert
Basin in 2012.  Uganda  has an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of
oil, with about 1 billion barrels in proven reserves, according
to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
