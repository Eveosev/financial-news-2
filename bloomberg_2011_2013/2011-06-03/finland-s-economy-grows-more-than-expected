Finland’s economy grew faster than
expected in the first three months of this year, led by
investments, as an expansion in the northernmost euro member
extended to a fifth quarter.  Gross domestic product adjusted for seasonal variations
grew 0.8 percent from the prior three months when it expanded a
revised 1.8 percent, Helsinki-based  Statistics Finland  said on
its website today. Three economists’ forecasts collected by
Bloomberg ranged from growth of 0.3 percent to 1.3 percent,
while the statistic office’s trend indicator pointed to a 0.3
percent expansion. The economy grew an annual 5.5 percent.  Finland’s economic recovery was led by investments, which
expanded 2.6 percent last quarter, as construction recovered and
industry required more machinery and equipment. Services rose 1
percent in value from the prior quarter.  Exports jumped by 33 percent last quarter from a year ago
by value, when a strike closed Finnish ports for more than two
weeks, blocking 90 percent of sales abroad, according to figures
from Finnish Customs. By volume, exports were 15.9 percent
higher than last year,  Statistics Finland  said.  The contribution of trade to Finnish GDP remained at just
over a third last year, compared with about half in years prior
to the recession. Finland’s biggest market,  Germany , grew a
seasonally adjusted 1.5 percent in the first quarter, extending
its expansion to two years. Swedish growth slowed to 0.8 percent
while  Denmark  unexpectedly slid back into recession, shrinking
0.5 percent from the prior quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
