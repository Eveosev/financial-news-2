U.S. Gulf oil grades strengthened as
the spread between the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
and Brent widened for a third straight day.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery increased 56 cents to $15.70 a barrel as of 2:26 p.m.
in  New York . The differential for the contract nearest to
expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 10 cents to $16.75
over WTI as of 1:59 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium added 5 cents to
$16.25 a barrel over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened 10 cents to $10.85 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium weakened 25 cents to $10.25.  Thunder Horse’s premium widened 50 cents to $15.75 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon’s premium gained 50 cents to $10
a barrel.  West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at $1.95 a barrel.  The premium for Syncrude fell 10 cents to $8.40 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 25 cents to
$20.75 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
