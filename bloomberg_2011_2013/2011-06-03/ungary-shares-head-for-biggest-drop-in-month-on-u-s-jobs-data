Hungary’s main stock index extended
declines, heading for the biggest drop in a month after a report
showed the U.S. added fewer jobs than estimated in May and
unemployment in the world’s largest economy unexpectedly rose.  The BUX gauge of 13 companies sank as much as 2.1 percent
and traded down 1.8 percent to 22,955.83 as of 2:47 p.m. in
Budapest. Mol Nyrt., the country’s biggest oil refiner, led the
decline, tumbling 3.8 percent to 23,080 forint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
