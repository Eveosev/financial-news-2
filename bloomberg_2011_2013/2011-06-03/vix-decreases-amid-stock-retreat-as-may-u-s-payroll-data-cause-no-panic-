The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell, breaking their
pattern of moving in opposite directions, as lower-than-
estimated job growth failed to spur traders to pay more for
insurance against equity losses.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, fell 0.8 percent to 17.95 at 4:15 p.m. in  New
York . The index measures the cost of using options as protection
against declines in the S&P 500, which fell 1 percent to
1,300.16.  The Labor Department said employers added 54,000 jobs last
month, trailing the median economist estimate of 165,000 in a
Bloomberg survey. The report reinforced speculation that a
slowdown in the world’s largest economy is persisting into the
second quarter.  “There’s no panic,” said Jonathan Bensimon, head of
equities and derivatives trading for the Americas at Societe
Generale SA in New York. “The figure was bad so the market
deserves to go a little lower, but no one thinks that there will
be a big selloff.”  The VIX has fallen 39 percent from this year’s peak of
29.40, which was reached after  Japan ’s record earthquake and
tsunami in March, and is below the 20.35 average over its two-
decade history. The VIX and the  S&P 500  move in the opposite
direction 81 percent of the time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  July VIX futures rose 0.3 percent to 19.40. August
contracts climbed 0.3 percent to 20.36. The most-active VIX
options were July 17 puts, which rose 2 cents to 85 cents.
Almost 174,000 VIX puts changed hands, compared with 109,661
calls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
