South Korea  plans to allow biogas and
other gas alternatives to be sold for wholesale, ending state-
run  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) â€™s distribution monopoly in the city gas
market.  The government announced the revision of a law governing
the distribution license of alternatives to natural fuel gas,
including gas produced from the cracking of naphtha and coal,
the Knowledge Economy Ministry said  on its website .  As early as in the second half of this year, alternative
gas producers could provide products to city gas distributors
which would mix the gas alternatives with natural gas for retail
to households and cars.  Korea Gas declined 2.5 percent to 35,400 won as of 1:36
p.m. in Seoul trading, headed for the biggest drop since May 12.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
