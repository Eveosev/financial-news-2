German government debt extended gains
after data showed U.S. employers added the fewest number of
workers in eight months and unemployment unexpectedly rose.  The yield on 10-year bunds,  Europe â€™s benchmark debt
securities, fell two basis points to 2.97 percent as of 1:31
p.m. in  London  after earlier rising to 3.01 percent. The two-
year yield slid three basis points to 1.61 percent.  U.S. payrolls increased by a less-than-projected 54,000
last month, after a revised 232,000 gain in April, Labor
Department figures showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
