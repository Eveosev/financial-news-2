Loews Corp. (L) , the company run by  New
York ’s Tisch family, would weigh acquisitions outside of oil
drilling and natural gas pipelines to change its mix of
businesses.  “We’d like to acquire non-energy businesses to diversify
further, but only if the right opportunity can be found,” Chief
Executive Officer James Tisch said today at a conference
sponsored by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York, where Loews
is based.  To contact the reporter on this story:
