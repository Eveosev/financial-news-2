South Africa  sold inflation-linked
bonds maturing in 2028 at the lowest yield this year as
investors bet rising fuel and food costs will spur price
increases in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  sold 85 million rand ($13
million) of the 2.6 percent bonds, known as linkers, at an
average yield of 2.54 percent, the lowest since Nov. 19. It also
sold 405 million rand of 2.75 percent notes due 2022 at an
average yield of 2.52 percent, and 115 million rand of 3.45
percent notes due 2033 at an average yield of 2.51 percent,
according to the central bank’s data on Bloomberg.  Price increases in South Africa are driven mostly by
“cost-push” factors such as international food and oil prices,
which are beyond the effect of local monetary policy, Deputy
Governor  Daniel Mminele  said on May 27. The bank would raise
 interest rates  if these costs spread to other prices, he said.
The consumer inflation rate rose to 4.2 percent in April, from
4.1 percent the month before.  “We’re cyclically in an upward cycle in inflation, and
that is a favorable environment for inflation-linked bonds,”
Rashaad Tayob, who helps oversee about 800 million rand of
assets including linkers at Aeon Investment Management in Cape
Town, said by phone before today’s auction.  The central bank forecast this month that inflation will
breach the 3 percent to 6 percent target in the first quarter of
2012, peaking at 6.3 percent. The 10-year breakeven rate, or
yield difference between inflation-linked bonds and standard
notes of similar maturity, is 5.68 percent. If the breakeven
rate is below average inflation, linkers return more than fixed-
interest bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
