Societe Generale (GLE)  SA designed a $1 billion
bet on its own shares for Libya’s sovereign wealth fund in March
2008, and the investment had fallen 72 percent in value by the
middle of last year, the Financial Times reported, citing
documents that it’s reviewed.  The transaction involved a $1 billion note, repayable to
the Libyan Investment Authority in 2018, that would reflect the
performance of an equivalent investment in SocGen’s shares; the
bank told the Libyans that, while an equity investment in
dollars would be subject to currency fluctuations, a derivatives
transaction would hedge that risk, the newspaper said.  The episode is an example of how prominent European and
U.S. financial companies did business with President Muammar Qaddafi’s  Libya  in ways that, whatever the benefits or lack of
them for Libya, generated substantial fees for themselves, the
FT said.  SocGen said it couldn’t comment on specific clients or
transactions; the Libyan Investment Authority didn’t respond to
a request for comment, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
