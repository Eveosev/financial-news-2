South African shares had the biggest
weekly drop in four as U.S. unemployment rose in May and oil
fell, damping the outlook for commodities companies and curbing
bets on emerging-market assets.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index declined for a third
day, losing 1 percent to 31,575.65 by the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg, taking the weekly loss to 2.5 percent.  BHP
Billiton Plc (BIL) , the world’s biggest mining company, slumped 1.4
percent to 255 rand, an 11-week low, while  Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the
world’s largest producer of auto-mobile fuel from coal, slipped
1.6 percent to 347.03 rand.  Oil extended declines after a U.S. Labor Department report
showed employers in May added the fewest number of workers in
eight months and unemployment unexpectedly rose to 9.1 percent,
underscoring  Federal Reserve  concerns the expansion is failing
to boost the labor market.  “We have had such a bad week of data and are now tracking
the global markets,” David Shapiro, an analyst at Johannesburg-
based Sasfin Holdings Ltd., said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
