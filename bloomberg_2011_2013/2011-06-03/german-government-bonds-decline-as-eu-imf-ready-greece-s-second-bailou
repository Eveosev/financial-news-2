Greek two-year notes rose, sending
yields to their biggest intraday drop in almost five months, as
European policy makers readied an additional aid package for the
debt-stricken nation.  German 10-year government bonds fell, headed for their
first decline in eight weeks, while two-year notes depreciated
for a fifth consecutive day, pushing yields up by the most since
the week ended March 25. Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
who leads a group of euro-area finance ministers, said the
European Union will approve a new aid plan for  Greece . Greece’s
 Finance Ministry  said a review of the country’s economic
progress by the EU,  International Monetary Fund  and  European
Central Bank  concluded “positively” today.  “There’s speculation that following the end of the latest
review that more funding will be forthcoming, and that will tide
Greece over its funding gap,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-
income strategist at RIA Capital Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Short-
dated Greek bonds continue to rally as market expectations of a
default fade. Increasing optimism about Greece is also reducing
some of the flight to quality.”  Two-year Greek yields fell 146 basis points to 23.09
percent as of 3:55 p.m. in  London . They dropped as much as 175
basis points to 22.81 percent, the biggest intraday drop since
Jan. 13. They extended their weekly decline to 2.4 percentage
points, the most since the five days ending May 14, 2010. The
4.6 percent security due May 2013 gained 1.870, or 18.70 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,457) face amount, to 73.50. Ten-year yields
fell 22 basis points to 16.03 percent.  Greek, Portuguese Debt  Greek debt led gains by two-year securities from the
region’s bailed-out nations. Portuguese note yields fell 25
basis points to 10.94 percent after touching a two-week low of
10.86 percent, while yields on Irish securities of a similar
maturity declined 18 basis points to 11.36 percent.  A deal “gives you a reason just to take on a bit of risk,
or readjust your position to be less short of risk at least,”
said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “It would be
something that gives Greece another year’s breathing space.”  With the progress review complete, EU leaders will now
focus on wrapping up a new bailout package to prevent the euro
area’s first sovereign default. A year after the rescue that
aimed to stop the spread of the debt crisis, Greece remains
mired in recession and shut out of financial markets. Moody’s
Investors Service said June 1 that it sees a 50 percent chance
of a Greek default.  Bund Yields Fall  The 10-year German bund yield advanced six basis points to
3.05 percent. It earlier reached 2.96 percent, the lowest since
Jan. 12, after a report showed U.S. employers added the fewest
number of workers in eight months in May and unemployment
unexpectedly rose.  The yield on German two-year notes was four basis points
higher at 1.68 percent after reaching 1.56 percent on May 30,
the least in 10 weeks.  The yield difference, or spread, between 10-year German
bunds and Greek securities of a similar maturity narrowed 54
basis points over the week to 1,289 basis points.  European services and manufacturing growth slowed less than
initially estimated in May. A composite index based on a survey
of euro-area purchasing managers in both industries fell to 55.8
from 57.8 in April, London-based Markit Economics said in a
statement today. That’s above an initial estimate of 55.4
published on May 23. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  German  government bonds  have handed investors 0.1 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
U.S. Treasuries have returned 2.8 percent. Greek bonds have
handed investors at 12.5 percent loss, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
