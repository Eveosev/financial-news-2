Huaneng Renewables Corp., the wind-
power unit of  China ’s biggest electricity producer, raised
HK$6.23 billion ($800 million) in a  Hong Kong  initial public
offering, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The arm of China Huaneng Group Corp. sold 2.49 billion
shares at HK$2.50 apiece, near the midpoint of a range marketed
to investors, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. The deal was offered at
HK$2.28 to HK$2.98 a share in the prospectus for the sale.  The IPO’s success reflects China’s emergence as the world’s
biggest wind-energy market by installed capacity, having
overtaken the U.S. last year, Global Wind Energy Council data
show. At the end of 2010, China had a total of 42.3 gigawatts of
wind power capacity compared with 40.2 gigawatts for the U.S.  The Asian nation also last year exceeded the U.S. as the
most attractive place to carry out renewable-energy projects,
according to a ranking produced by Ernst & Young LLP. The
Chinese government wants at least 15 percent of the country’s
energy to come from renewable sources, including wind, by 2020.  Investors paid about 14.2 times Huaneng Renewables’
forecast 2011 earnings, the people said. That’s between China
Datang Corp. Renewable Power Co.’s trading price of 16.7 times
estimated 2011 profit and Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology
Co., which trades at a multiple of 12.6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  False Start  The Beijing-based company plans to start trading on June
10. Huaneng Renewables scrapped an earlier listing plan because
of unexpected and excessive market volatility, the company said
on Dec. 13.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , China International Capital Corp., Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Macquarie Group Ltd. managed the IPO, the
prospectus shows.  China Datang Corp. Renewable, the wind unit of the nation’s
second-largest power producer, raised HK$5 billion ($643
million) in a Hong Kong initial public offering in December. The
shares have since fallen 5.2 percent, based on yesterday’s close
of HK$2.21.  Beijing Jingneng Clean Energy Co., an operator of gas-fired
power plants in China’s capital, is seeking as much as $700
million in a Hong Kong IPO, people with knowledge of the matter
said on May 12. The unit of state-owned Beijing Energy
Investment Holding Co. aims to start trading in June, the people
said.  Key Investors  China Investment Corp., Temasek Holdings Pte and  General
Electric Co. (GE)  are among key investors who agreed to buy a
combined $415 million of stock in Huaneng Renewables’ IPO, the
prospectus shows. The Chinese sovereign wealth fund subscribed
for $60 million of shares, while Temasek,  Singapore ’s state
investment company, agreed to invest $50 million, the document
shows.  Turbine prices dropped about 5 percent in the first quarter
from the previous three months to an average of 3,797 yuan
($586) per kilowatt, according to New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
