Turkey  will give incentives to makers
of chemicals, cars and textiles for the industries to produce
semi-finished goods in the country instead of importing them to
help stop a gaping current account deficit,  Haberturk  reported,
citing State Minister Zafer Caglayan.  A government study carried out by a local think-tank, known
as Tepav, as well as  Harvard University  and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology envisages setting up tax-free or low tax
industrial zones near Istanbul, Izmit, Bursa and Izmir towns,
Caglayan said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
