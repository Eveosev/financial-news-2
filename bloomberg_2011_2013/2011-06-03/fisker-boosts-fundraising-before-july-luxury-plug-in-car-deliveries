Fisker Automotive Inc., a maker of
luxury plug-in hybrid cars, said it has raised $600 million in
venture-capital funding so far and plans to seek more before
delivering its first vehicles next month.  Fisker on May 12 announced a plan to raise $100 million and
has since increased that amount to $115 million, Joe DaMour, the
carmaker’s chief financial officer, said in a telephone
interview today. It completed two similar rounds in mid-2010 and
early this year that each raised $190 million, DaMour said. He
declined to discuss the timing of a possible initial public
offering for  Irvine , California-based Fisker.  “We have approximately $250 million in cash in the bank.
We’re in a very solid financial position, and want to continue
to maintain that and frankly fortify it,” DaMour said. “I
can’t discuss future funding activities. What I can tell you is
we plan to stay out ahead of the curve, from a funding
standpoint.”  U.S. customers waiting for Fisker’s first plug-in model,
the Karma sports car that goes about 50 miles (80 kilometers) on
battery power before a gasoline engine propels it, are to start
receiving vehicles in mid-July. Car designer Henrik Fisker, the
company’s chief executive, said in a November 2010 interview
that an initial public offering was possible after Karma
production and sales began.  Karma, Nina  Karma prices range from $95,800 to $108,000, prior to a
$7,500 federal tax credit, Fisker said. Along with its privately
raised capital, the company won a $529 million federal loan in
2009 that’s being used to refurbish a former General Motors Co.
plant in  Delaware  that will produce a lower-priced plug-in car,
Fisker’s Nina model, starting in 2013.  The company will have 45 U.S. dealers by the end of July,
Fisker said. Some 3,000 people have paid $5,000 to reserve a
Karma so far, and the company hopes to sell as many as 15,000 a
year.  “We’ve continued to execute rounds of financing because
frankly the interest from the investor side is very strong,”
DaMour said.  Investors in the closely held company include Kleiner
Perkins Caufield & Byers, a  Menlo Park , California-based venture
capital fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
