Sina Corp., the owner of  China ’s
third-most visited website and the Twitter-like Weibo service,
tumbled the most in more than two years, leading declines among
U.S.-listed Chinese Internet stocks.  Sina plunged 11 percent to $111.60 at 4 p.m. New York time,
the biggest decline since December 2008.  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  slid 4.4
percent to $77.92, the lowest in more than two weeks. Baidu
Inc., which owns China’s most popular search engine, dropped 3.8
percent, the most in two weeks.  Investors sold the stocks as they reduced holdings of high-
risk securities before the weekend on concern about the global
economy after a report showed U.S. jobs growth slowed, said
 Michael Yoshikami , chief investment strategist at YCMNet
Advisors, which manages $1 billion in Walnut Creek,  California .  “Chinese Internet stocks are on the top of the list in
terms of risk-oriented assets, certainly for U.S. investors,”
Yoshikami said. “They are starting to wonder if the valuations
are reasonable.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped for a third day,
declining 1 percent to 1,300.16, the lowest level since March.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  had its longest streak of
weekly losses since 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
