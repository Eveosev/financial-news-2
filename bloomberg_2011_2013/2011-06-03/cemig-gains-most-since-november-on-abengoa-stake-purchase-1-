Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais, a
Brazilian state-controlled electricity utility, rose the most
since November in  Sao Paulo  after buying stakes in transmission
lines from  Spain ’s Abengoa SA.  Cemig, as the company is known, advanced 4.1 percent to
30.87 reais at the 4:15 p.m. New York time close.  Abengoa agreed to sell stakes in transmission lines in the
South American country to Cemig for 485 million euros ($710
million), according to a PR Newswire statement. Abengoa will
also sell 100 percent of concession company NTE to CEMIG.  “We view this deal as positive for Cemig,” Vladimir Pinto
and Marcelo Sa, analysts at Banco Bradesco SA, wrote in a note
to clients today. “The multiple seems reasonable for the asset
acquired. Cemig will have more possibilities to create value
through synergies with its existing portfolio. In addition, the
company strengthens its relevant position in the transmission
business.”  Cemig, which serves  Minas Gerais  state, is the eighth-best
performer on the Bovespa index this year, rising 16 percent
while the benchmark is down 7.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
