About two-thirds of  Syria ’s Internet
networks became unreachable early this morning, security firm
Renesys said on its website today.  Within half an hour, the routes to 40 of 59 networks were

country’s Web traffic depends on domestic operator Syriatel
Mobile Telecom SA, the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
