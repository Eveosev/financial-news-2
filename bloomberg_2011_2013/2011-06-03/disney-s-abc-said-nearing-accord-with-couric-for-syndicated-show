Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC is close to an
agreement with Katie Couric for a syndicated talk show, two
people with knowledge of the situation said.  The parties may announce an accord as soon as Monday, said
the people, who declined to be identified because they weren’t
authorized to speak publicly.  An agreement with Couric would give ABC and its affiliate
stations a brand name replacement for  Oprah Winfrey , whose
syndicated afternoon program ended a 25-year run on May 25.
While distributed by  CBS Corp. (CBS) , Winfrey’s program was carried by
ABC stations covering almost half of the U.S. TV households,
according to information provided by the networks.  Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based
Walt Disney Co., didn’t immediately respond to requests for
comment. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today the two
sides were finalizing an agreement.  Couric, 54, was anchor of the “CBS Evening News” for five
years before stepping down last month. Prior to that she was co-
host of the “Today” show on NBC.  Disney fell 68 cents to $39.38 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 5
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
