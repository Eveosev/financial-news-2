Malawi’s economy will probably expand
by 6.9 percent this year, driven by higher mining and
agricultural output, even though foreign aid declines, Finance
Minister Ken Kandodo said.  The southern African nation’s economy is estimated to grow
6.6 percent next year while inflation will average 7 percent,
Kandodo said in a budget speech to parliament in Lilongwe, the
capital, today.  “These growth rates are expected to be anchored by strong
performance in  agriculture sector  as it rebounds, as well as
mining and construction sectors,” he said.  The U.K. has stopped aid to the country after President
Bingu wa Mutharika expelled the U.K. high commissioner because
of a leaked cables criticizing his leadership. The government
said it would budget for less aid this year.  Kandodo said spending for the fiscal year through June 2012
would decline 2 percent to 304 billion kwacha ($2 billion) and
forecast revenue and aid at 307.7 billion kwacha. The proportion
of aid of total revenue dropped to 21 percent from 30 percent,
he said.  The state will prioritize recurrent spending and use aid
funds for development projects, Kandodo said.  Tobacco earnings will probably drop 33 percent to $300
million due to lower prices and a high rejection rate of the
leaves during sales this year, Kandodo said.  Malawi is the world’s biggest grower of burley tobacco and
the crop is its main foreign-exchange earner. Burley tobacco is
a lower-grade variety of the leaf used to fill cigarettes
flavored with higher-grade flue-cured tobacco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
