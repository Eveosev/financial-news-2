If today's workplace had an anthem, it might very well be the British indie duo  Ting Tings' new song  with its refrain "Clap your hands if you're working too hard." Workplaces are more demanding than ever in terms of hours and performance. Americans are  putting in more hours per week than previous years . That's creating a rising tide of resentment among the 70 million Gen Ys flooding into the workforce.  Gen Ys know what they want — and it's not the all-work-and-no-life dynamic of their Boomer parents. "We have watched our parents waste away in drab cubicles and count the days to retirement," Gen Y writer  Courtney Martin explained in a  Christian Science Monitor  op-ed . "Call me idealistic but isn't work supposed to be part of life? Do I have to accept the idea that 'real life' begins when I punch out at 8 p.m. each day?" Gen Ys want a rewards remix, according to " Bookend Generations ," a study from the  Center for Work-Life Policy . Instead of the traditional plums of prestigious title, powerful position, and concomitant compensation, they value challenging and diverse job opportunities, stimulating colleagues, a well-designed communal workspace, and flexible work options, with 89% of Ys saying flexible work options are important consideration in choosing an employer. "Millenials view work-life balance as their right," observes Ron Alsop in  The Trophy Kids Grow Up . To obtain that balance, they are becoming "agents of change, pushing flexibility to the top of the workplace agenda." They don't mind putting in long hours so long as they can choose those hours,  another study of Gen Y workers  noted. As one woman surveyed snapped, "Why do they care if I'm four minutes late to work if I'm the top performer in my department?" Multinational organizations may be surprised to find that this sentiment has gone global — and that they have to adapt. "A third of our new hires come from India and China," explains a senior manager in  Cisco 's inclusion and diversity division for the Asia-Pacific region. Despite coming from cultures that value face time, she adds, as Gen Ys, they "expect to work in new and different ways based on their natural rhythms, not confined to an office for 8, 10, or 12 hours a day." Companies that want to be seen as an employer of choice are learning to treat time as currency — through remote work options, staggered hours, part-time and shared-job arrangements, and mini-sabbaticals. "Flexibility is one of the most important aspects of being a competitive employer," notes Kerrie Peraino, Senior Vice President, International Human Resources at  American Express .  Flex work, including the option of telecommuting, offers employers numerous low-cost, high-return advantages. The most obvious payoff: Employees can concentrate without being interrupted by phone calls, meetings, and other workplace distractions. Not only a powerful lure in recruiting high-caliber people, flexibility also helps retain them by meeting the needs of a "new and different" tranche of talent. One successful flex-time approach is  Citi's  Work Strategies. This program started as a model for tomorrow's green, cost-effective, and employee-friendly workplace but soon turned beneficial to many interested in flexible work arrangements. Realizing that in some instances Citi was wasting resources on office space that no one was using, the division suggested using office-sharing, "hoteling" at satellite offices, and work-from-home arrangements to reduce the organization's real estate portfolio while offering a new type of workspace arrangement. The program has since evolved to encompass part-time schedules, remote work, flexible start-and-stop times, compressed schedules, and job sharing. Employees apply through a formal process that requires them to fill out a work plan describing how they will do their job in its new flexible format, the potential impact on clients and team members, and the technology they need — such as webcams, instant messaging, and teleconferencing — to support their new approach. At the same time, managers are training to lead and supervise remote teams. Citi's annual employee surveys show that the flex-work participants are consistently more engaged, more likely to stay, and more likely to recommend Citi as a great place to work.  What other ways can a company provide flexible alternatives for their Gen Y employees and get the best work for them? What is your own experience managing Gen Ys on flex-work?
