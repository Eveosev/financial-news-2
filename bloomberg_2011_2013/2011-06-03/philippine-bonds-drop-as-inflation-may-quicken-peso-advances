Philippine local-currency bonds
declined this week on speculation inflation quickened by the
most in two years last month, which may prompt the central bank
to raise  interest rates . The peso advanced.  Consumer prices gained 5.1 percent in May from a year
earlier, compared with 4.5 percent in April, according to the
median estimate of economists before the government’s June 7
report. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas increased its overnight
borrowing rate twice this year to 4.5 percent and will next
review policy on June 16.  “The market would like to wait for the inflation data and
if it will indeed breach 5 percent,” said Bunny Bernardo-Recto,
vice president at Chinatrust Philippines Commercial Bank Corp.
in Manila. “In that case, the view of the market is that the
central bank will probably raise rates again this month.”  The yield on the 5.875 percent January 2018 bond rose 11
basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, this week to 5.98
percent as of 4:10 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tradition
Financial Services. The rate climbed two basis points today.  The peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 43.213 per dollar and
gained 0.4 percent this week, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  Consumer prices may have increased by 4.5 percent to 5.5
percent in May from a year earlier, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said on May 26. Price gains at the top-end of his
forecast would be the fastest pace since March 2009, based on
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter for this story:
