Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened this
week by the most in more than a month as investors cut demand
for the dollar after Moody’s Investors Service warned the U.S.
of a possible downgrade.  The ringgit snapped a four-week loss after Moody’s said it
may place the Aaa rating, the highest investment grade, under
review should the U.S. not make progress in addressing its debt
ceiling by mid-July. A government report today showed the
Southeast Asia nation’s exports rose 11.1 percent in April from
a year earlier, slower than the 11.3 percent growth estimated by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The Moody’s report changes the ballgame and shifts
investors’ focus from  Europe  to the U.S.,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a foreign-exchange strategist at CIMB Investment
Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The ringgit is holding firm because
of the knock-on effect from the dollar weakness.”  The ringgit climbed 0.1 percent to 3.0120 per dollar as of
4:40 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency appreciated 0.7 percent this week, the
most since the period ended April 29.  Standard & Poor’s  in April said the U.S. risks losing its
AAA credit rating unless the government reduces the  budget
deficit  and national debt.  Malaysia’s government bonds fell today and were unchanged
for the week. The yield on the 4.16 percent note due July 2021
rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, according to
prices from Bursa Malaysia. The rate was at 3.98 percent
yesterday, the lowest level since March 17.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
