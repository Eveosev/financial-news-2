Latvia’s current-account, a measure
of funds flowing into and out of a country, recorded a surplus
of 1.7 percent of economic output in the first quarter as
exports of services increased and real-estate investment grew.  The surplus totaled 52.7 million lati ($76.4 million), in
the first three months of the year, the Riga-based central bank
said in an e-mailed statement today. For 2010, the current
account had a surplus of 3.6 percent of gross domestic product.  The Baltic nation’s current account, which reached a
deficit of 27.1 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2006,
swung into a surplus as the country’s economic crisis led to
loan losses for foreign banks and imports collapsed. Latvia’s
economy, which contracted 18 percent in 2009, expanded 3.4
percent in the first three months.  “Overall, a small surplus of the current account could be
retained in 2011, mainly as a result of current transfers,”
central bank spokesman Martins Gravitis said in the statement.  Latvia was forced to turn to a group led by the European
Union and the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro
($10.9 billion) loan in 2008 after the country’s second-biggest
bank needed a state rescue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
