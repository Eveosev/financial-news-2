Rwanda should review its genocide
ideology and sectarianism laws that have been used to stifle
free speech and political opposition, according to  Amnesty
International .  Rwanda drafted the laws in response to genocide in 1994
when 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred.
Amnesty said in a report released today the policies are overly
vague, broad and used by the government to punish journalists,
human rights workers and political opposition.  The East African nation’s elections last year, where
President  Paul Kagame  won with 93 percent of votes, was “marked
by a clampdown on freedom of expression,” the London-based
organization said in its report.  Rwanda is already in the process of reviewing the policies,
said Justice Minister Tharcisse Karugarama in an e-mailed
statement released before the Amnesty report, which the
government called “inaccurate” and “highly partisan.”  Rwanda has recently taken steps to develop its media with
new policies, Karugarama said.  “Any review of the headlines of independent print and
broadcast press will show that the president and the government
are regularly criticized, even insulted, without facing any
action,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
