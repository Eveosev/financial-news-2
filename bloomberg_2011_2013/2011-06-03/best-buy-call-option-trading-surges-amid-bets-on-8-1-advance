Best Buy Co. rose and call-option
trades jumped to quadruple the full-day average over the past
four weeks on speculation that billionaire investor  William Ackman  bought a stake in the retailer.  The trading was spurred by speculation that Ackman’s
Pershing Square Capital Management LP hedge fund “purchased a
stake in the company,”  Patrick Mortimer , director of options
trading at Pipeline Trading Systems LLC in  New Hope ,
Pennsylvania, said in a report to clients. “Option players are
taking a bullish stance.”  Sue Busch, a spokeswoman for the Richfield, Minnesota-based
company, said the world’s largest consumer-electronics retailer
won’t comment about trading of its shares or speculation about a
possible investment by Pershing. Bethany Norvell, a spokeswoman
for Pershing, declined to comment and said the company doesn’t
address rumors.  Almost 29,000 calls to buy Best Buy shares changed hands as
of 4 p.m. in  New York , nine times the number of puts to sell.
The shares rose 0.3 percent to $30.63 and the most-active
contracts were June $33 calls, which expire June 17 and have a
strike price 7.7 percent above today’s close. Best Buy hasn’t
closed above $33 for three months. Those contracts rose 8.3
percent to 26 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
