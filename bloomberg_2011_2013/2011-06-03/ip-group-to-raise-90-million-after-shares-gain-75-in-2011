IP Group Plc (IPO) , a U.K. developer of
renewable energy, medical and chemicals businesses using
university research, said it will raise 55 million pounds ($90
million) selling new stock to increase investment in start-ups.  The London-based company will offer the shares at 50 pence
each, a 5.9 percent discount to their 53.13-pence closing price
yesterday, it said today in a regulatory filing. The sale will
increase its shares outstanding by 43 percent.  IP Group, which has exclusive contracts for intellectual
property with 10 U.K. universities and made deals with Oxford
and Cambridge, gained 75 percent in London trading this year
through yesterday. That beat both the FTSE Small Cap index,
which has increased 1.6 percent, and the WilderHill New Energy
Global Innovation Index, which has risen 0.3 percent.  Separately, IP Group said it promoted Financial Controller
Greg Smith to become chief financial officer. Smith, who will
join the board, was a manager at London-based hedge fund Tarchon
Capital Management before joining IP Group in January 2008.  The company, which in April said BlackRock Inc. had
acquired a 5 percent stake, has generated an internal rate of
return of about 27 percent since 2001, according to the
statement. It owns 110 million pounds of stakes in 63 companies.  The shares rose 0.6 penny, or 1.2 percent, to 53.75 pence
today as of 9:15 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
