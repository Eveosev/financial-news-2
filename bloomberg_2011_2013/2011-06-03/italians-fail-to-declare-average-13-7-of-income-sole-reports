Italians fail to declare on average
13.7 percent of their annual income,  Il Sole 24 Ore  said, citing
a report by a group of government consultants.  Evasion amounts an average of 2,093 euros ($3,029) for each
taxpayer, according to a working group of the  Treasury  in charge
of submitting proposals for the reform of the tax system, the
newspaper said. Tax compliance is lower in northern  Italy , among
males and for those under 44 years old, Sole cited the report as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
