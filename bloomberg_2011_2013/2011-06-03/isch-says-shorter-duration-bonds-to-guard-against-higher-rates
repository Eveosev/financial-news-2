Loews Corp. (L)  is investing in shorter-
duration bonds at its insurance unit because it believes yields
will increase, Chief Executive Officer James Tisch said.  “At some point in the future, there will be a significant
rise in  interest rates ,” Tisch said today at a conference
sponsored by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York, where Loews
is based. “We’ve kept our portfolio short as a result, short
and prepared for an increase in rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
