Ethanol futures dropped to the lowest
level in more than a week amid ample supply of the biofuel and
declining corn prices.  The grain-based additive slumped a day after the Energy
Department said production rose 0.8 percent to 909,000 barrels a
day last week, the highest level since March 18. Stocks slipped
2.7 percent to 20.2 million barrels from a record 20.8 million.
Separately, corn fell on signs of slowing demand.  “Ethanol really doesn’t have its own story,” said Ronnie
Virissimo, a trader at SCB & Associates LLC in  Chicago . “That
was really all corn-driven. Stockpiles are high. Production is
high. It’s ugly.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 1.2 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $2.64 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures fell 0.8 percent this week and have climbed 11
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  increased 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.735 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive gained 0.5 cent to $2.64, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf jumped 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.775 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel added 0.5 cent
to $2.785.  Corn futures for July delivery dropped 12.5 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $7.54 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
