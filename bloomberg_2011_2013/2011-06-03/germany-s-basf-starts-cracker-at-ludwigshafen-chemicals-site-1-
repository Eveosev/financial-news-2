BASF SE (BAS)  is starting a cracker at its
Ludwigshafen chemicals site in Germany following planned
maintenance that began in April.  “We are in the restart process of one of our crackers”
since June 1, Friederike Segeberg, a company spokeswoman, said
today in an e-mailed statement. “The cracker has been closed at
the end of April.”  Ludwigshafen has a cracker with capacity to produce 400,000
metric tons of ethylene a year and another 220,000-ton unit,
making it the fourth-largest chemicals complex in Germany,
according to the  Association of Petrochemicals  Producers in
Europe. Ethylene is used to make plastic products.  Crackers typically use naphtha as feedstock. Naphtha’s
discount to  Brent crude  narrowed to $7.65 a barrel compared with
$7.92 yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., an oil
and refined products broker in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
