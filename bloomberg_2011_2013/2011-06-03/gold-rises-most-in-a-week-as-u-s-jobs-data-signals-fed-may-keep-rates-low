Gold futures rose the most in a week
on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will keep  interest rates 
low to stimulate the  U.S. economy , boosting the appeal of the
precious metal as an alternative to the slumping dollar.  The greenback headed for the third straight weekly decline
against a basket of major currencies as this week’s economic
reports showed the U.S. recovery is waning. Employers in May
added the fewest number of workers in eight months, and
unemployment climbed to 9.1 percent. Before the jobs figures
were released today, gold dropped as much as 0.5 percent.  “We’ve seen the data stream take a turn for the worst,”
said Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago .
“Traders are not convinced there won’t be further measures
taken to keep borrowing costs low. In an uncertain economic
environment, gold is a good choice.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $9.70, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $1,542.40 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York , the biggest gain since May 27. This week, the
price climbed 0.3 percent, the fourth straight gain. The metal
has advanced 27 percent in the past year, reaching a record
$1,557.40 on May 2.  The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate at
zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and pledged to
buy $600 billion in Treasuries through the end of June to help
revive the economy.  Yesterday, gold slumped as much as 1.5 percent.  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-
based Gartman Letter, reduced his holdings of the metal by half
a day after recommending buying more and selling euros.  ‘Violent Selling’  “We fear the possibility that gold might swiftly fall to
$1,480 or so over the course of the next few days or weeks,”
Gartman said. “The violent selling in gold this week is
sufficient to cause us to reduce our position in gold by half
this morning.”  Silver futures for July delivery fell 1.1 cents to $36.191
an ounce, down 4.4 percent this week. The price has tumbled 27
percent since reaching a 31-year high of $49.845 on April 25.
The commodity has doubled in the past 12 months.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose $15, or 1.9
percent, to $785.40 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The metal gained 3.1 percent this week. The price has
advanced 74 percent in the past 12 months.  Platinum futures for July delivery rose $5.90, or 0.3
percent, to $1,823.70 an ounce, up 1.3 percent this week. The
price has climbed 18 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
