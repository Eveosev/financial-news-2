More than 3,000 workers in  South
Africa ’s fishing industry along the nation’s west coast are on
strike after talks over support payments failed, the Food &
Allied Workers’ Union said in an e-mailed statement today.  The union wants workers to get an allowance of 40 percent
of their normal weekly wage of 412 rand for every week of non-
production to help them during the months they’re not used by
fishing companies, the labor union said. The companies named by
the union in the dispute include Premier Fishing, Oceana,
Gansbaai Marine, Suid-Oranje, Saldanha Group and Marine
Products.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
