On July 23, 1775, Eugene-Francois
Vidocq was born to a respectable French baker and his wife in
Arras. He was a tough kid, getting into fights, and routinely
stealing from his parents.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  After jimmying open the till one night and taking 2,000
francs, he ran away from home. In Ostend,  Belgium , he met a
stranger who brought him to a feast with some handsome and
amiable women. Vidocq later woke up nearly naked and broke on
the docks.  He then joined a traveling circus, working with a middle-
aged puppeteer and his 16-year-old wife, Eliza, until Vidocq was
caught making out with her. The prodigal son returned home, but
in 1791, he joined the army and fought 15 duels over the next
six months, killing two men.  Vidocq became a famous criminal, who made daring escapes
from prison time and time again. Turning informant, he also
became director of the Surete Nationale, the state police force,
founded the first private detection agency and invented many
sophisticated police techniques still in use, before dying in
1857.  I spoke with James Morton, author of “ The First
Detective ,” on the following topics:  1. Born to Be Wild  2. Swordsman and Womanizer  3. Ex-Con Spies  4. Police Work  5. Private Eye  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
