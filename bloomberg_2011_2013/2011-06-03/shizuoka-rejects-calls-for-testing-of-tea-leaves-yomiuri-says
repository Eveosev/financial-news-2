Shizuoka,  Japan ’s top tea producing
prefecture, has rejected the central government’s call to test
its dry tea leaves for radioactive cesium, the Yomiuri newspaper
 reported.   Subjecting Shizuoka’s tea leaves to the opinion of the sole
radiation expert at the Nuclear Safety Commission is unfair,
Governor Heita Kawakatsu told the newspaper. Dry leaves are
semi-finished products not intended for direct consumption, he
said.  Shizuoka produced 42 percent of the total 86,000 metric
tons of dry tea leaves in Japan in 2009, according to  the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.   To contact the reporters on this story:
