Peruvian presidential candidate
Ollanta Humala saw his support rise before a June 5 runoff vote,
a poll published today showed, as backing for Congresswoman
Keiko Fujimori declined.  Humala, leader of  Peru ’s Nationalist Party, had 51.8
percent support in a poll by Peru’s Catholic University,
compared with 49.7 percent a week earlier. Fujimori had 48.2
percent support, down from 50.3 percent, the poll shows  The Lima-based university said 9.3 percent of those polled
cast a blank vote. The university contacted 1,800 people on June
2 and the poll had a margin of error of 2.31 percentage points.  Humala’s support is strongest outside the capital city of
Lima, the poll shows. He has 61 percent of the rural vote and 55
percent of urban votes excluding Lima. Fujimori, the daughter of
the jailed former President  Alberto Fujimori , has 58 percent
support in the capital, the university said.  A poll by Lima-based Ipsos Apoyo, which was released to
clients yesterday, showed Fujimori had a lead over Humala of 2.2
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
