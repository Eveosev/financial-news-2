China Resources Power Holdings Co. is
Credit Suisse Group AG’s top pick among Hong Kong-listed
electricity producers including  Huaneng Power International Inc. (902) 
after China raised tariffs and the company’s coal reserves grew.  The unit of state-controlled China Resources Holdings Co.
will benefit from the tariff increase  announced  yesterday while
being able to cushion against higher coal prices because of its
rising fuel self-sufficiency, Hong Kong-based Credit Suisse
analysts Edwin Pang and Yang Song wrote in a research note today.  China, fighting its worst electricity shortage in seven
years, raised power prices paid by nonresidential users for the
first time in more than a year to rein in demand. The National
Development and Reform Commission, the top economic planner,
also increased tariffs that grids pay power plants, including
Datang International Power Generation Co., and allowed some
adjustments to be backdated to April this year and January 2010.  “ China  Resources Power is our sector pick,” the analysts
said. “It enjoys part of the upside to tariff hike while
protecting against the risk of coal price increases. This is due
to its rising exposure to coal mining.”  The power producer’s coal output may climb to about 18.8
million metric tons in 2011 from 9.6 million tons last year,
they said. China Resources Power may be able to meet 42 percent
of its demand from its mines in 2012, compared with 35 percent
this year and 22 percent in 2010, according to the analysts.  The company, whose shares have fallen 3.7 percent in Hong
Kong trading in the past year, dropped 0.3 percent to HK$15.04
as of the midday break. In a survey of 27 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg, 22 rate the stock a “buy,” while five recommend
holding the shares. The  Hang Seng Index  declined 0.3 percent.  Retroactive Increases  Huaneng rose 0.9 percent to HK$4.54. Twelve analysts
recommend buying the shares, while 14 rate the stock a “hold.”
Datang was unchanged at HK$2.87. Eighteen analysts rate the
stock a “hold,” while seven recommend buying the shares.  The retroactive Jan. 1, 2010, price increase was already
approved by the government last year, the analysts wrote.
Implementation of the tariff change may boost Huaneng and
Datang’s 2010 earnings by 7 to 8 percent, they said.  The two companies have yet to decide whether to adjust
their 2010 earnings or book the additional profit in their 2011
accounts, according to the analysts.  -- Wang Ying . Editors: Ryan Woo, John Chacko.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
