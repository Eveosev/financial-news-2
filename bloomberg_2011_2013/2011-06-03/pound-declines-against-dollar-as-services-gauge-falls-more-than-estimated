The pound extended a decline versus
the dollar and weakened against the euro after a gauge of U.K.
services industries fell more than economists had estimated.  The British currency slid 0.3 percent to $1.6323 as of 9:31
a.m. in  London . It depreciated 0.2 percent to 88.68 pence per
euro.  The index based on a survey of companies fell to 53.8 in
May from 54.3 in April, Markit Economics Ltd. and the  Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said. That compares with the
median estimate of 54.2 from 26 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
