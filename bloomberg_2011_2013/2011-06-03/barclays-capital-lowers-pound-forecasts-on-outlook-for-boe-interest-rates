Barclays Capital  cut its six-month
and one-year forecasts for the pound, citing the outlook for
Bank of England  interest rates  after data showed weaker than
expected U.K. services growth last month.  Barclays Capital cut its six-month forecast to $1.74 from
$1.76 and 85 pence per euro from 84 pence per euro. The one-year
forecasts were reduced to $1.76 from $1.80 and 82 pence per euro
from 80 pence,  Paul Robinson , London-based head of European
currency strategy at the investment-banking unit of Barclays
Plc, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  The investment-banking unit of Barclays Plc pushed back its
forecast for the central bank to start raising interest rates to
November from August. Services industry expansion was the
slowest in three months in May, Markit Economics Ltd. and the
 Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said today.  “We continue to expect some appreciation for the pound
against both the dollar and euro, but in trade-weighted terms
pound is likely to remain significantly weaker than its pre-
crisis norm,” Robinson said.  The pound depreciated 0.6 percent to 89.04 pence per euro
and climbed 0.1 percent to $1.6392 as of 4:52 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
