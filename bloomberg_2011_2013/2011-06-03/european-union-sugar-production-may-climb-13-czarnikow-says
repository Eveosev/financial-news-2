European Union sugar output may climb
13 percent in 2011-12 as plantings expand,  C. Czarnikow Sugar
Futures Ltd . said in its first estimate for the new crop.  Production will increase to 17.4 million metric tons from
15.4 million tons a year earlier, London-based Czarnikow said in
report today.  Sugar beet  plantings may rise 6 percent, it said.  “Warm weather across the European spring has been
conducive to good yield potential, only tempered of late by poor
rainfall,” Czarnikow said in the report.  Spring beet plantings are now complete and beet development
in the majority of the bloc is about two weeks ahead of last
year, Czarnikow said. Yields may improve by about 10 percent, it
said.  “Well-established sugar beet tends to endure dry
conditions better than many other arable crops, meaning that for
the moment at least, yield improvements on last year of up to 10
percent are still realistic.” The 2011-12 season starts Oct. 1
in most countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
