Sugar supplies will exceed demand by
10.3 million metric tons next season, reversing a shortage of
500,000 tons this crop year, as producers respond to high
prices, according to  C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd .  Global production will rise by 14.2 million tons to a
record 182.2 million tons, the broker said in a report e-mailed
today. Sugar output from sugar cane will reach a record of 145.4
million tons and sugar beet production will climb to a five-year
high of 36.8 million tons. Sugar rose to a 30-year high of 36.08
cents a pound on Feb 2.  “Our current estimate of production in the 2011-2012 cycle
represents the concerted effort of nearly all producing
countries to maximize production,” Czarnikow’s Director Toby Cohen said in the report.  Global stocks, which have been declining for three years,
are likely to rise, Czarnikow said. “The larger size of the
surplus and the broad spread of countries in which production is
expected to grow significantly strengthens the prospect that
depleted global stocks will be rebuilt,” it said in the report.  Consumption will grow by 2 percent in 2012 to 171.4 million
tons as an expected lower price volatility caused by the surplus
should spur buying, the broker said in the report.  The estimated sugar shortage for 2010-11 was lowered from
3.6 million tons forecast in February to 500,000 tons, according
to the report. The figure was revised on a larger-than-expected
crop in  Thailand .  Brazil , Thailand  Sugar output in Brazil, the world’s largest producer, will
rise by 1.7 million tons to 42.8 million tons in the 2011-12
season due to limited availability of the raw material,
according to Czarnikow. “Limited growth in cane is the biggest
constraint facing the sector,” the broker said in the report.  Production in Thailand, the second-largest exporter, will
reach 10.2 million tons next season, an upward revision of more
than 2.3 million tons from Czarnikow’s February figure, the
report showed.  India’s output will climb to 29.3 million tons in 2011-12,
an increase from the 26.1 million tons forecast for the current
season. Consumption will be 26.2 million tons in 2011-12.  India 
is the world’s second-largest producer of sugar and the top
consumer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
