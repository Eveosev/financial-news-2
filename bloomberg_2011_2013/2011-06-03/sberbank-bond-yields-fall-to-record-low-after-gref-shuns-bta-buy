OAO Sberbank’s 2017 bonds rose,
sending yields to a record low after Chief Executive Officer
 German Gref  said he doesn’t see a “big chance” for  Russia ’s
largest bank to acquire  Kazakhstan ’s BTA Bank.  The yield on Sberbank’s $1.25 billion of dollar notes fell
65 basis points, or 0.65 percentage point, to 4.468 percent as
of 1:51 p.m. in Moscow, the lowest level since the debt was
issued in September. Gref made the comments at the state-run
company’s annual shareholder meeting in Moscow today.  Sberbank completed due diligence on the Almaty-based lender
at the end of last year. BTA was Kazakhstan’s biggest lender
before its nationalization and default two years ago. Losses are
currently 5 percent to 10 percent above the bank’s estimates,
said Nick Dove, director at London-based consulting firm John
Howell & Co., BTA’s adviser on its asset recovery strategy. The
final figure may be as low as zero percent or as high as 20
percent, he said in a telephone interview last week.   Dove said his comments relate to the situation as of the 
middle of 2010.  Gref’s comments today are “marginally positive,” Dmitry Dudkin, the head of fixed-income research in Moscow at UralSib
Financial Corp., said by e-mail. “Any acquisition is a risk and
usually requires some cash outflow -- and in the case of BTA the
asset itself is of very doubtful quality.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
