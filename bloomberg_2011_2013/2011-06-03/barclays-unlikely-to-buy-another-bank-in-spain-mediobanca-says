Barclays Plc (BARC)  is unlikely to expand in
 Spain  in the near term despite speculation the U.K. bank is
negotiating to buy a domestic savings bank, according to an
analyst note by Mediobanca SpA.  Rather than add to its existing presence by buying another
bank, “Barclays will be looking to sharpen up performance in
Spain with an eye to reviewing its position in that market when
it is looking more robust,” said Mediobanca in a note to
clients today. The suggestion that Barclays may also use an
acquisition “as an excuse to raise additional capital does not
fly, in our opinion.”  The London-based bank has “a decent presence in Spain and
was hoping to become a top five bank,” but it has been
“refocusing its franchise on a mass affluent client base” and
closing 120 branches and cutting staff numbers by 20 percent,
Mediobanca added. Barclays Spain serves more than than 1 million
customers and clients in the country and a network of about 590
branches, according to the bank’s website.  Yesterday, Evolution Securities Ltd. said Barclays may seek
to raise as much as much as 5 billion pounds ($8.2 billion) in a
rights offering to buy a Spanish savings bank and top up
capital.  Reports suggesting that Barclays may be seeking to purchase
a bank were fueled by a May 24 meeting between Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and Barclays Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  in  Madrid .  To contact the reporter on this story:
