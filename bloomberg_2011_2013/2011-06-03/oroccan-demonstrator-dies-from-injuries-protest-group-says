A member of the February 20 youth
movement, a group demanding democratic changes in  Morocco , died
yesterday in a hospital after suffering injuries during a
demonstration on May 29, the organization said in an e-mailed
statement.  Kamal Ammari, a political activist, was hurt during a
protest broken up by the authorities in Safi, 350 kilometers
(217 miles) south of the city of Casablanca. Government
officials couldn’t be reached for comment.  Demonstrations began in Morocco on Feb. 20 aimed at
reducing the power of the king, curbing corruption and ending
police brutality.  After popular protests in the region that toppled
governments in Egypt and  Tunisia , Morocco’s King Mohammed VI
said in March he would introduce more liberties. Activists have
called for peaceful protests against repression to be held on
June 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
