Slovenians will probably reject the
pension changes in a referendum this weekend, putting additional
pressure on strained public finances, a  poll  showed.  Some 52.2 percent of those surveyed said they would vote
against raising the  retirement age  to 65 from an average of 60,
with 31.4 percent backing the change, according to a poll by
Delo Stik agency. The survey of 1,007 adults was carried out
from May 30 to June 1, Delo newspaper reported today. No margin
of error was given.  Slovenian officials, including central bank Governor Marko Kranjec, have warned that rebuffing of pension changes would put
additional pressure on the budget and public spending, harm the
country’s economic recovery and probably prompt rating services
to lower Slovenia’s credit score.  To contact the reporter on this story:
