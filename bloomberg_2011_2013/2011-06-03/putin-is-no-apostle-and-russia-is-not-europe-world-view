You might expect a comparison between Russian prime minister (and former spymaster)  Vladimir Putin  and one of Jesus' 12 apostles to include a reference to 30 pieces of silver. In its report on an eccentric Russian sect, however, Reuters  revealed  that Judas isn't the appropriate apostolic reference: The sect's leader, a former convict named Svetlana Frolova, opined that: “Putin's past lives included that of Grand Prince Vladimir of Rus, credited with founding the Russian Orthodox Church more than a millennium ago.” Which may be going a bit far, even for  Russia . Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, disclaimed any link with the sect, noting that, “Putin does not approve of that kind of admiration." Quirky though her religious faith may be, Frolova appears to have a keen grasp of Russian politics: "You can be prime minister and still remain president," she said, leaving little room at the top of government for  Dmitry Medvedev , Russia's official president. Frolova has concluded that God will intervene in Putin’s favor in next year’s presidential election, though Putin hasn't announced his candidacy. "Medvedev is merely Putin's student,” she said. The Apostle Paul experienced his conversion on the road to  Damascus . Apostle Putin underwent a transformation himself on a local street. Strollers in downtown  Moscow  encountered posters showing the Ruling Tandem -- Putin and Medvedev --  tanned and jauntily outfitted in white tennis shorts and cardigans . The posters prompted an affair of state, as the headline on an  Interfax.ru  story announced: “The Government Has Demanded that the Advertisement Showing Putin and Medvedev be Removed.” Putin spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  said the unauthorized poster “verged on hooliganism.” The  BBC’s Russian Service  reproduced the poster, revealing that the hooliganism was actually a work of “street art.” In an interview with the BBC, the poster's anonymous creator said: Europeanization has been a long and bumpy road in Russia, beginning in the 17th Century under  Peter the Great . It hasn't fully taken. Ilya Yepishkin, a blogger on ZhivoyZhurnal’s  I-narodny.livejournal.com,  reported that on May 31 -- as on the thirty-first day of months for the past two years -- pro-democracy protestors gathered peacefully on Moscow’s centrally-located Triumfal’naya Square. They found themselves facing beefy, club-wielding riot troops and counter-demonstrators wearing tee-shirts announcing, "With us are Putin, God and  United Russia " -- Putin's political party. Alan Cullison of the Wall Street Journal provided the  background : Cullison also pointed out that a “U.S. diplomatic cable, recently released by  Wikileaks,  called Mr. Limonov a fringe opposition figure, whose influence will only last as long as his ability to attract more recruits who are willing to be beaten and arrested.” Limonov, however, “believes his critics are out of touch with the tough underlay of Russian political life, and that a polite western-style liberal movement whose members fear the police will never stand up to Kremlin steamrolling. He complains that western-leaning politicians often criticize his methods, but can’t summon supporters of their own. “They are all generals without armies,” Limonov said. “We are the only real force out there.” Only twenty-seven demonstrators, Limonov included, were arrested. Though Limonov's protests occur regularly in this city of 12 million, they rarely draw much of a crowd, due to widespread Russian apathy, and rarely receive publicity – evidence, perhaps, of the chill the Kremlin casts over press freedoms. A post at  I-narodny.livejournal.com  contains Ilya Yepishkin’s dramatic, close-up photos of the protest, which show, among other things, Limonov’s arrival in a pack of bodyguards, various arrests, mild scuffles, and protesters holding placards reading: “I’ll SWAP PUTIN FOR KHODORKOVSKY,” referring to jailed Russian tycoon  Mikhail Khodorkovsky , and “ELECTIONS WITHOUT AN OPPOSITION ARE A CRIME!” An explanatory caption on one photo read: Meantime, the murder case of one of Russia's most famous journalists took an intriguing turn. Timofey Borisov and Natalya Kozlova of the state newspaper  Rossiyskaya Gazeta  reported on the government's arrest, in Chechnya, of 37-year-old  Rustam Makhmudov , the Chechen accused of gunning down journalist and human-rights activist  Anna Politkovskaya  in her apartment building's elevator in 2006. Politkovskaya’s “brazen murder,” the correspondents noted, “either on purpose or by chance took place on [Putin’s] birthday” and “provoked a widespread public response” -- that is, rumors that the killer had intended his deed as a grisly birthday gift to the then-president. Makhmudov, who will be transferred to Moscow’s  Lefortovo Prison , claimed that he “had tired of hiding” – in  Belgium  of all places – “and was preparing to surrender himself to the authorities.” Evidently the alleged killer had grown tired of living in  Europe .
