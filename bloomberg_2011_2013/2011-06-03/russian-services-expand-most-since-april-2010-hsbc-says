Russiaâ€™s services industry expanded
last month at the fastest pace since April 2010 because of an
increase in new business, a survey showed.  The services Business Activity Index rose to 57.6 in May
from 55.8 in April, HSBC Holdings Plc said in a report today,
citing data compiled by  Markit Economics , a financial
information services company. The survey indicates contraction
when below 50 and growth above 50.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
