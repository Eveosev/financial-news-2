Russian stocks slid the most in more
than a week as crude dropped below $100 a barrel, damping the
outlook for producers, while rising U.S. unemployment curbed
bets on riskier assets.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 stocks slipped 1.5 percent to
1,633.02 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest loss
since May 23. The gauge climbed as much as 0.6 percent earlier.
OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil pipeline operator, declined 2.4
percent. OAO Rosneft, the country’s biggest oil producer,
retreated 1.7 percent, while OAO Gazprom, the natural-gas export
monopoly, dropped 2.5 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
fell 1.3 percent to 1,858.08.  Oil, Russia’s chief export revenue earner, sank as much as
2.3 percent to $98.12 a barrel in  New York  after a report showed
U.S. employers in May added the fewest number of workers in
eight months and unemployment unexpectedly rose to 9.1 percent,
underscoring Federal Reserve concerns that growth is failing to
boost the labor market.  “These job figures from the US will be a fright to
policymakers as the second round of quantitative easing comes to
an end and will make investors feel more risk averse,” Marco Casas, Moscow-based vice-president for equity sales at Otkritie
Financial Corp., said in e-mailed comments today.  The weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data has triggered
speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may decide to extend
economic stimulus beyond the expiration in June of its current
program of so-called quantitative easing.  Investors withdrew $62 million from Russia-focused equity
funds in the week to June 1, the fourth consecutive week of
outflows, according to VTB Capital, citing data from EPFR
Global.  To contact the reporter on this story:
