Voluntary adult male circumcision has
emerged in the past decade as a “critical” tool to prevent HIV
infection, according to a United Nation AIDS agency study.  The  139-page report  said male circumcision offers a 60
percent reduction in HIV risk and the benefits are life-long.
The number of people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, rose
27 percent, to 33 million, between 1999 and 2009, according to
the report.  More than 350,000 men in eight African countries agreed to
lose their foreskins in 2010 to lower their chances of catching
HIV, six years after some studies showed the procedure was
effective, the report said. That compares with 100,000 men
taking part in the procedure in 2009. The countries are  Kenya ,
Namibia, Rwanda,  South Africa , Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  Circumcision is the surgical removal of a skin that covers
the tip of the penis. The UN-sponsored researchers say the
pocket between the foreskin and the tip of the penis gives
viruses and bacteria a spot to grow, and circumcision eliminates
it. They also say foreskin has been shown in studies to be rich
in cells that carry HIV into the body.  The  World Health Organization , former president Bill Clinton and  the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  are among the
supporters of circumcision clinics in  Africa .  Africa is home to two-thirds of people living with
HIV/AIDs, WHO data show. The number of young girls between the
ages of 10 and 14 living with HIV increased to more than 300,000
in 2010, from about 50,000 in 1999. Girls are five times more
likely to become infected than young men, according to the UN
AIDS agency report.  -- With assistance from Simeon Bennett in  Singapore . Editor:
