OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil pipeline
operator, said profit declined 1 percent last year as costs
surged on rail shipments to the Pacific coast.  Net income slipped to 119.2 billion rubles ($4.3 billion)
from 120.4 billion rubles, Moscow-based Transneft said on its
website today. Sales climbed 27 percent to 447.5 billion rubles.  Operating expenses increased by 54 percent to 280 billion
rubles as Transneft began shipping oil by rail from the end of
its East Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline at Skovorodino to the
port of Kozmino on Russia’s eastern coast. The shipments cost
29.6 billion rubles last year.  The costs also climbed on depreciation, which rose 54
percent to 72 billion rubles, and other expenses, which include
a gain from oil surplus and expenses on charity, rose 21 percent
to 12 billion rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
