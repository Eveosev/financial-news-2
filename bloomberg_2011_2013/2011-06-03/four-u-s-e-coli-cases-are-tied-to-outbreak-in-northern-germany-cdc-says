Four reported U.S. cases of E. coli
infections have been connected to the outbreak in  Germany ,
raising the number from two, according to the  Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention .  All four people were traveling in northern Germany before
returning to the U.S. and becoming ill, Chris Braden, the
director of the foodborne, waterborne, and environmental
diseases division for the Atlanta-based CDC, said today on a
conference call.  At least 18 people have died and more than 1,800 cases of
the infection triggered in Germany have been reported in the
deadliest outbreak of the bacteria on record, according to
health officials from the U.S. and the  World Health Organization 
in Geneva. The U.S. gets 0.2 percent of its produce from Germany
and Spain, because the shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables
is short, David Elder, the  Food and Drug Administration’s 
director of regional operations, said. All produce from Germany
and  Spain  is being checked by inspectors before it is allowed to
enter the U.S., he said.  “This outbreak has not affected the U.S.,” Elder said
during the conference call with reporters. “There’s no reason
for Americans to alter” their diets, he said.  In addition to the four suspected cases in the U.S., two
American military members, believed to be stationed in Germany,
may also be ill with related infections, Braden said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
