Alastair Cook  steadied England’s
first innings after Sri Lanka took three quick wickets this
morning in the first day of the second cricket Test at Lord’s in
London.  Cook was unbeaten on 75, while Eoin Morgan was not out on
23 at the tea break. Cook’s fellow opening batsman, captain
Andrew Strauss, was out on 4 after 12 balls, while Jonathan
Trott and Kevin Pietersen were both out on 2. Cook and  Ian Bell 
combined for 108 runs before Bell was caught on 52.  Sri Lanka won the toss, and elected to field. Suranga
Lakmal and Chanaka Welegedara each took two wickets for the
visitors, who are looking to even the Test series after losing
by an innings and 14 runs in the first match in Cardiff.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
