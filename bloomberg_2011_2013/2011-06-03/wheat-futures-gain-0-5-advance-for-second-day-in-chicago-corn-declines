Wheat futures advanced for a second
day on speculation dry weather in the U.S. and parts of  Europe 
and excessive rains in Canada will curb global supply.  Informa Economics Inc. yesterday lowered its U.S. wheat-
crop estimate by 0.9 percent to 2.088 billion bushels this year,
Output was 2.208 billion bushels last year, according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates. The  Memphis , Tennessee-
based researcher also reduced its harvest forecasts for the
European Union by 5.4 percent and for Canada by 1.8 percent.  The weather “keeps pressure on for prices to move
higher,”  Jonathan Barratt , managing director at Commodity
Broking Services Ltd. in Sydney, said in an e-mail today.  Wheat for July delivery gained 3.25 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $7.735 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 11:47 a.m.
London time, paring this week’s decline to 5.6 percent. Milling
wheat on the NYSE Liffe exchange in Paris rose 0.4 percent to
238.50 euros ($345.54) a metric ton.  The U.S.,  Canada  and the EU are the world’s biggest
shippers of wheat, according to the USDA.  Corn for July delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$7.645 a bushel, set for a 0.8 percent gain this week. July-
delivery soybeans gained 0.4 percent to $14.125 a bushel in
Chicago, taking the weekly gain to 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
