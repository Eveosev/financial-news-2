Canadian stocks declined for a fifth
day, erasing their 2011 gain, as energy stocks fell on lower
crude-oil prices and financial companies dropped after the
country reported a 21 percent plunge in building permits.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest oil and gas producer,
lost 2.6 percent as crude dropped.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the
country’s biggest lender by assets, slipped 1.4 percent after
 Statistics Canada  said building permits sank the most in five
years in April.  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) , the forestry company accused
of manipulating financial data by a short seller, surged 55
percent after tumbling 71 percent in the previous two sessions.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 112.87
points, or 0.7 percent, to 13,429.04 at 11:29 a.m. in Toronto.  “There’s no doubt the economic news lately not only in the
U.S. but in many other parts of the world has not been so
good,” said Stephen Gauthier, a  money manager  at Fin-XO
Securities in  Montreal , which oversees about C$600 million ($613
million). “Everybody’s a little bit nervous about what we’ll
see in the next six months.”  The S&P/TSX fell 2 percent last week, trimming its 2011
gain to 0.6 percent, as the U.S. unemployment rate climbed to
the highest since December. The U.S. accounted for 75 percent of
Canadian exports last year, according to Statistics Canada. The
index’s five-day slide is the longest since Jan. 10.  Crude futures declined as much as 1.4 percent in  New York 
as traders speculated slower economic growth will limit demand.  Energy Producers  Suncor dropped 2.6 percent to C$38.57. Penn West Petroleum
Ltd., a western Canadian oil and gas producer, lost 2.8 percent
to C$24.13.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , Canada’s largest pipeline company,
slipped 2.4 percent to C$30.86.  Financial stocks retreated after building permits fell more
than all 13 economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast. Royal
Bank dropped 1.4 percent to C$54.45.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,
 North America ’s fourth-largest insurer, declined 2.1 percent to
C$16.10.  Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , Canada’s third-biggest
insurance company, lost 1.3 percent to C$28.98 after touching a
six-month intraday low of C$28.84.  Sino-Forest, which operates in  China , soared 55 percent,
the most since 1994, to C$8.09 after pledging to release proof
of land ownership. On June 5, Carson C. Block, the founder of
Hong Kong-based Muddy Waters Research, said the company’s
disclosures of timber holdings do not match city records.  Companies with operations in  Peru  retreated after Ollanta Humala claimed victory in the country’s presidential election.
Humala has called for greater state control over natural
resources.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, fell 1.3 percent to C$48.87.  Bear Creek Mining Corp. (BCM) ,
which explores for precious metals in the country, dropped 5.8
percent to C$5.84.  Rio Alto Mining Ltd. (RIO)  slumped 16 percent to
C$1.99 after tumbling as much as 26 percent, the most intraday
since August 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
