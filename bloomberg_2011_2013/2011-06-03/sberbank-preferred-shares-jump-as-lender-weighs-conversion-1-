OAO Sberbank’s preferred shares
jumped to a six-week high after Chief Executive Officer  German Gref  said the lender may convert some to common stock.  The preferred shares surged 6.1 percent to 69.42 rubles by
the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the highest level since April 20.  Russia’s largest lender is considering options to reduce
its preferred shares, Gref said at the bank’s annual
shareholders meeting in Moscow today.  “Gref’s comments indicate there will be conversion
sometime in preference shares, which is causing the stock to
spike,” Marco Casas, the Moscow-based vice-president for equity
sales at Otkritie Financial Corp., said in e-mailed comments
today.  Sberbank’s ordinary shares fell 1.8 percent to 95.19
rubles, the most in over a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
