German stocks rose, rebounding from a
six-week low, as banks rallied after  Jean-Claude Juncker  said
the European Union will approve a new aid plan for  Greece ,
outweighing weaker-than-forecast U.S. jobs data.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s largest lender, and rival
 Commerzbank AG (CBK)  advanced more than 1.5 percent.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ,
the nation’s biggest steelmaker, climbed 2.5 percent. EON AG and
 RWE AG (RWE)  fell following a report that the utilities will have to
lower their sales forecasts.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  gained 0.5 percent to 7,109.03 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in  Frankfurt . The measure has still declined
0.8 percent this week as Moody’s Investors Service raised
Greece’s default risk to 50 percent and U.S. factory orders fell
the most in almost a year. The broader HDAX Index rose 0.4
percent today.  The DAX tumbled as much as 0.8 percent earlier today after
a report showed U.S. employers added fewer workers in May and
unemployment unexpectedly rose to 9.1 percent, underscoring
 Federal Reserve  concerns the expansion is failing to boost the
labor market.  Payrolls increased by a less-than-projected 54,000 last
month, after a revised 232,000 gain in April that was smaller
than initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for payrolls
to rise 165,000.  Banks Advance  Deutsche Bank climbed 1.9 percent to 40.88 euros and
Commerzbank,  Germany ’s second-largest lender, increased 4.3
percent to 3.24 euros.  Banks advanced across  Europe  as Juncker, who leads the
group of euro-area finance ministers, said the EU will approve a
new aid plan for Greece. The Mediterranean country said a review
of its economic progress by EU and International Monetary Fund
officials concluded “positively.”  ThyssenKrupp rallied 2.5 percent to 32.77 euros, climbing
for the first time in three days as analysts recommended the
sector. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a report today that
investors should buy steelmakers as European prices will pick up
in the third quarter.  EON and RWE, Germany’s biggest utilities, declined 1.2
percent to 18.84 euros and 2.7 percent to 38.19 euros,
respectively. The Financial Times Deutschland reported that EON,
RWE, Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG and Vattenfall Europe AG will
lose about 3.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in sales per year
from the permanent shut down of 8 out of Germany’s 17 nuclear
power plants. The newspaper cited its own calculations.  EON, RWE Ratings  Moody’s Investors Services placed both companies’ A2/Prime-
1 ratings on review for downgrade while  Fitch Ratings  placed RWE
on rating watch negative.  Roth & Rau AG (R8R) , a maker of solar-cell production equipment
that generates more than half of its revenue in  Asia , rallied 3
percent to 22.94 euros.  China Securities Journal today reported the country is
planning to double its solar-power generation capacity to 10
gigawatts by the end of 2015, citing an unidentified person. An
industry development plan for the five years through 2015 has
been submitted to the State Council for approval, the Beijing-
based newspaper said.  Separately, Sharp Corp. forecast that its operating profit
will rise 23 percent this year on increased earnings from solar
power and liquid-crystal displays.  Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (KD8)  rose 1.6 percent to 46.19
euros, climbing for the first time in three days. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. reiterated its “conviction buy” recommendation for
the cable operator and raised its price estimate 7.7 percent to
61.50 euros. That’s 35 percent above yesterday’s closing price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
