The Czech government is considering
several options on how to initiate a vote of confidence in
parliament when lawmakers debate bills needed to cut the fiscal
deficit,  Pravo  reported, citing Prime Minister Petr Necas.  Necas originally planned to tie legislation overhauling
public finances to a confidence vote. While that would set a
deadline for approval of the bills, it might lead to a
protracted debate, which could cause a collapse of the cabinet,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
