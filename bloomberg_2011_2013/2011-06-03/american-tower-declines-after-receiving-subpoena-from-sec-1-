American Tower Corp. (AMT)  fell the most in
more than two months after the wireless tower operator said it
received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission related to its accounting.  The SEC requested documents from 2007 until now, with an
emphasis on records for tax reporting and accounting, the
Boston-based company said today in a regulatory filing. American
Towerâ€™s customers include  AT&T Inc. (T) , Verizon Wireless, Sprint
Nextel Corp. and T-Mobile USA.  The shares fell $3.17, or 5.8 percent, to $51.21 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m., the largest
one-day drop since March 21. The stock is little changed this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
