Former U.S. Senator  John Edwards  is
likely to be charged today over funds used to cover up an
extramarital affair during the 2008 presidential campaign, the
 Associated Press  reported, citing an unidentified person with
knowledge of the investigation.  Edwardsâ€™ lawyer Greg Craig was traveling to North Carolina
to meet with prosecutors, indicating either a grand jury
indictment or a negotiated charge that would result in a guilty
plea, the AP said.  Justice Department officials have decided that hundreds of
thousands of dollars from two Edwards donors, used to keep his
mistress in hiding, should have been reported as political
donations because they helped his campaign for the Democratic
nomination for president, the AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
