AES Corp. (AES) , A U.S. power producer
with operations in more than two dozen countries, put into
operation a 1.2 billion-euro ($1.74 billion) coal-fired power
plant at Galabovo in southeastern  Bulgaria .  The plant, part of the Maritsa East mining and power
generation complex, has two units with total output capacity
of 600-megawatt which account for 9 percent of Bulgariaâ€™s
installed power capacity, AES said in an e-mail today.  The plant starts operations with 420 megawatt output and
will reach its full capacity by the end of the year. The
Arlington, Virginia-based utility, also built a 93 million-
euro waste disposal facility at the plant to meet European
Union anti-pollution requirements, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
