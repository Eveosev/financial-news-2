The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  against non-payment rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 0.25 basis point to 109.25 basis
points as of 8:40 a.m. in Singapore, according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at
109.25 basis points as of 10:44 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was also little changed at
126 basis points as of 9:45 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
