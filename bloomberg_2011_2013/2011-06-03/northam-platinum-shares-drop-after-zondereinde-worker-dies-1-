Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM) , a South
African mining company, fell to the lowest price in almost two
weeks in Johannesburg trading after a mineworker who was injured
in a May 27 accident died.  The worker died after being wounded during water-jet
cleaning operations at Northam’s Zondereinde mine, the company
said today in an e-mailed statement. Shares in Northam fell for
a third day, retreating 0.7 percent to 44.20 rand as of 5 p.m.,
the lowest closing price since May 23.  Production at the mine hasn’t been affected by the
accident, Charmane Russell, a spokeswoman for the Johannesburg-
based company, said today in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
