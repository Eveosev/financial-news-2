China’s northern province of  Inner
Mongolia  aims to complete consolidation of 35 rare-earth
producers under Baotou Iron and Steel Group Co. this month.  Local city governments in the province will also shut down
22 rare-earth smelters, according to a  statement  on the Baotou
city government website. They will close down nine other
unauthorized smelters, it said.  Inner Mongolia accounts for more than 75 percent of China’s
production of rare earths, used in  wind turbines , hybrid cars
and guided missiles. The government is driving consolidation in
strategic industries to create profitable companies.  “The consolidation aims to achieve unified mining,
exploration, smelting and management of rare earth production
and processing under Baotou Iron & Steel Group,” the statement
said.  China  started to rein in mining of rare earths in May 2009,
setting production quotas to curb pollution. Export cutbacks
prompted countries, including the U.S. and  Japan , to revive
domestic mining or seek alternative resources.  Inner Mongolia Baotou has been designated by the government
to open a rare earth exchange that will handle spot transactions,
state-run Xinhua News Agency said on May 27. The exchange will
have a registered capital of at least 100 million yuan.  --Xiao Yu. Editors: Keith Gosman, Rebecca Keenan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
