Lebanonâ€™s budget deficit doubled in
the first four months from the year-earlier period as revenue
declined.  The deficit widened to 2.1 trillion Lebanese pounds ($1.4
billion) from 1 trillion pounds, the  Ministry of Finance  said in
an e-mail today. Revenue slid 10.8 percent to 3.6 trillion
pounds, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
