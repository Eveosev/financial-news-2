  Germany ’s four largest utilities EON
AG,  RWE AG (RWE) , Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG and Vattenfall Europe
AG will lose about 3.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in sales per
year from the permanent shut down of eight out of Germany’s 17
nuclear power plants,  Financial Times Deutschland  said, citing
its own calculations.  The utilities will lose about half that amount in operating
profit from the shut downs, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
