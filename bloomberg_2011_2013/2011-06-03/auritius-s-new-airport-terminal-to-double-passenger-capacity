Mauritius’ planned new airport
terminal will double the handling capacity of passengers when it
opens by the end of next year, the airport’s operating company
said.  “Our target is to cater for 4 million passengers a year,
from the current 2 million checking in and out,” Bruno
Mazurkiewicz, chief executive officer of Airport Terminal
Operations Ltd., said in an interview yesterday in Plaisance,
about 50 kilometers (31 miles) south-east of  Port Louis , the
capital.  The company took a loan from Export-Import Bank of China
for 85 percent of the $305 million cost of the expansion, he
said.  The Indian Ocean island nation is targeting 1 million
foreign visitors this year compared with 934,827 in 2010, the
Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority said on Jan. 26, with Air
Mauritius Ltd., sub-Saharan Africa’s fourth largest airline,
increasing seat availability by 6 percent to 1.85 million.  ATOL, as the company is known, is a joint venture between
state-owned Airports of Mauritius Ltd. and  Aeroports de Paris (ADP) 
Management, which holds a 10 percent stake, Mazurkiewicz said.  Tourism is one of Mauritius’s main sources of foreign
currency, with revenue expected to rise by 7.7 percent to 42.5
billion rupees ($1.5 billion) in 2011, according to the  Central
Statistics Office . The biggest leisure groups by market value
are  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , Sun Resorts Ltd., and  Naiade
Resorts Ltd. (NRL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
