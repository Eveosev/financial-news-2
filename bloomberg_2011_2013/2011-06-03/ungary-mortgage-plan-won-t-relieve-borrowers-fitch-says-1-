Hungary’s plan to help troubled
homeowners with foreign-currency-denominated mortgages is
“unlikely” to make it easier for borrowers to service their
debt and banks to reduce delinquent loans,  Fitch Ratings  said.  The nation’s banks and the government agreed this week to
temporarily fix exchange rates on foreign-currency loans and to
lift a moratorium on evictions. Hungarian household mortgages
totaled 4.1 trillion forint ($21.9 billion) at the end of March,
of which 63 percent was denominated in foreign currencies,
according to central bank data. Over 100,000 such mortgages are
overdue.  The measures are “unlikely to have a material, long-term
positive impact on households’ ability to service their debt, or
on banks’ efforts to improve the performance of their
portfolios,” Fitch Ratings said in a statement from Moscow
today. They will probably “postpone the resolution of problems
with household indebtedness and bank asset quality, and in some
scenarios could actually accentuate them.”  Hungarians resorted to loans denominated in euros and Swiss
francs during the boom years last decade to escape high  interest
rates . During the global economic crisis, the practice backfired
as a shortage of credit worldwide meant eastern European banks
and their parents in Austria,  Italy ,  Germany  and Sweden
struggled to refinance those loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
