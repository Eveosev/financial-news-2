Itochu Corp. (8001)  said it has agreed to
acquire an 8 percent stake from Ivanhoe Nickel & Platinum Ltd.
in a mine project in  South Africa  for exploration and
development of nickel and platinum-group metals.  The Tokyo-based company will invest 22.4 billion yen ($277
million) for the stake, it said in a statement today. The
company now holds an aggregated stake of 10 percent in the
Platreef project after it invested $10 million to buy 2 percent
in September 2010.  Mining at the project located in the Northern Limb of the
Bushveld Complex is expected to start in 2017, Itochu spokesman
Yasuhiro Terashita said earlier by phone. Platinum-group metals,
which include palladium and rhodium, are used as catalysts to
clean exhaust gas from automobiles.  The project is expected to produce 20 metric tons of
platinum-group metals each year, Satoshi Kondo, president of
Itochu Mineral Resources Development Corp., a unit of Itochu,
told reporters today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
