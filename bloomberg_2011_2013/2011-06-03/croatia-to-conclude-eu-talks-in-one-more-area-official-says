Croatia  will advance its  European
Union  entry bid on June 6 by concluding one more policy area,
the chapter on fishery, said Vesna Pusic, head of the national
committee for the talks.  The former Yugoslav republic will then have concluded talks
in 31 out of 35 EU policy areas. Among the remaining challenges
is the area on judiciary and fundamental rights, where Croatia
is expected to make more progress.  Croatia hopes to conclude the talks in June or early July
and join the bloc in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
