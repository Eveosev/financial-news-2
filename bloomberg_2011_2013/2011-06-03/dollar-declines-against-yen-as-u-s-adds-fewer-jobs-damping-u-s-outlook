The dollar fell, reaching a one-month
low against the yen, after a report showed U.S. employers in May
added the fewest jobs in eight months, increasing concern the
recovery is slowing.  The euro rose to a one-month high against the dollar as
 Greece ’s government said a review of the country’s economic
progress by the European Union,  International Monetary Fund  and
European Central Bank concluded “positively.” The U.S.
currency dropped to a record low against the Swiss franc as
investors sought haven assets after the jobless rate
unexpectedly rose to 9.1 percent.  “The  U.S. economy  is in a cool-down period and with the
strong growth in the European core, the interest-rate
differential and the likelihood that you’re going to get another
bailout for Greece, it’s a recipe for euro strength,” said
Jessica Hoversen, a New York-based analyst at the futures broker
MF Global Holdings Ltd.  The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 80.54 yen at 10:55 a.m. in
 New York , from 80.90 yesterday, after touching 80.05, the
weakest since May 5. It dropped 0.8 percent against the franc to
83.48 centimes, the lowest level since at least 1971 and fell
0.5 percent to $1.4568 per euro, the weakest since May 6.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which
measures the greenback against the currencies of six trading
partners, fell 0.4 percent to 74.041 from 74.333, reaching the
lowest since May 6.  Annual Basis  The dollar has dropped 5.8 percent this year against its
nine developed-nation counterparts, the biggest decline in the
group, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
Indexes. The euro has gained 3 percent this year and the yen has
dropped 4.7 percent.  U.S. payrolls increased by a less-than-projected 54,000
last month, after a revised 232,000 gain in April that was
smaller than initially reported, Labor Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey called for payrolls to rise 165,000. The jobless rate
climbed to the highest level this year from 9 percent a month
earlier.  “It’s an ugly, ugly number. It shows a considerable
slowdown in economic activity,” said Boris Schlossberg,
director of research at online currency trader GFT Forex in New
York. “The Aussie dollar is tumbling very badly because it’s
clearly reacting to the negative risk news of the day.”  Services Update  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing business increased to 54.6 in May from 52.8 a
month earlier. The median forecast of 74 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected the measure would rise to 54.  The euro extended its gains after Greece’s announcement.
Discussions on fiscal plans, state asset sales and structural
reforms were held during the review, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Athens-based  Finance Ministry . These plans
will be submitted to Cabinet and then to Parliament in the
coming days, it said.  Australia ’s dollar fell 0.3 percent to $1.0639. New
Zealand’s currency dropped 0.8 percent to 80.90 U.S. cents and
Norway’s krone fell 0.2 percent to 5.3851 per dollar.  Weaker-than-expected economic data and low interest rates
have damped the appeal of U.S. assets as the  Federal Reserve 
lags behind central banks from the euro zone to Australia.  Factory Update  A report earlier this week showed manufacturing in the U.S.
last month expanded at the slowest pace since September. Home
prices in 20 U.S. cities dropped to the lowest level since 2003
in March, another report showed.  The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at a record
low of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. The  European
Central Bank  raised its rate by 25 basis points in April and the
 Reserve Bank  of Australia has raised its benchmark rate seven
times since the financial crisis.  Canada ’s dollar fell the most against the dollar among the
major currencies and  Mexico ’s peso also fell after the
unemployment report. The U.S. is the countries’ largest trading
partner.  The Canadian dollar dropped 0.6 percent to 98.09 cents per
 U.S. dollar  and the peso lost 0.4 percent to 11.6787.  To contact the reporter on this story:
