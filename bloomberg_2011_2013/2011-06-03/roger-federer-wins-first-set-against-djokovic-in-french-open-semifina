Roger Federer  of Switzerland leads
Novak Djokovic after three sets in their French Open semifinal,
putting the Serb’s 41-match winning streak at risk.  Federer leads 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 3-6 at Roland Garros in Paris.
The victor will face five-time champion  Rafael Nadal  in the
final in two days.  Third-seeded Federer is the most successful men’s player in
Grand Slam history, with 16 major titles. Djokovic, the No. 2
seed, will take Nadal’s No. 1 ranking on the ATP World Tour if
he beats Federer.  A victory also would make Djokovic 42-0 this year, tying
the record for the best start to a season set in 1984 by John McEnroe, his practice partner this week. Djokovic has won 43
straight times since losing to Federer in an indoor match in
 London  in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
