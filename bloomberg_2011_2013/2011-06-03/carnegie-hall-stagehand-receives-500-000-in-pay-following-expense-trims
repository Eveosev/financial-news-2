Money was so tight at Carnegie Hall
during the recession that even its stagehands took a hit.  Dennis O’Connell, who oversees props at the  New York 
concert hall, saw a 4.5 percent drop in pay and benefits in 2009
to $500,368, according to Carnegie Hall’s tax return. The four
other full-time stagehands made an average of $410,438, down 7
percent from a year earlier.  Neither Carnegie Hall nor the stagehands’ union --  Local
One of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees 
-- has provided details on the composition of stagehand pay.
Producers and staffers say stagehands work long hours, with
ample opportunity for overtime pay. They move equipment in and
out of the hall, prepare its three stages for performances and
operate audiovisual equipment.  “Their pay always varies each year as it is dependent on
number and type of events produced,” said Synneve Carlino, a
spokesman, in an e-mail. She declined to be more specific.  Carnegie Hall  reduced operating expenses 8 percent in the
year ending in June 2010, Vice Chairman and Treasurer Klaus
Jacobs said in its most recent annual report. The previous year,
net assets dropped by 17 percent, or $70 million, to $331.6
million.  In 2009, the executive and artistic director, Clive Gillinson, saw his pay and benefits fall 7.5 percent to
$893,360. Carlino said Gillinson’s $800,000 base pay was
unchanged from a year earlier, and the decline was due largely
to his retirement plan vesting. Anna Weber, general manager,
earned $347,367, down 3 percent.  Chief Financial Officer Richard Matlaga got a 12 percent
increase to $386,461, including pay, deferred pay and benefits.  Son-in-Law  Another winner was the architectural firm  Iu & Bibliowicz ,
co-owned by Natan Bibliowicz, the son-in-law of Carnegie Hall
Chairman Sanford Weill. The firm, which oversees the expansion
into two towers above the hall, received $3.1 million in 2009-
2010, following $5.3 million over the previous two years. The
sum includes fees paid to subcontractors, Carlino said. She
declined to provide a breakdown.  The hall’s annual report indicates it’s on firmer footing
than it was a year earlier. In 2009-2010, contributions to
Carnegie Hall jumped to $58.8 million from $11.3 million. Net
assets rose 16 percent to $385.3 million.  To contact the writer on this story:
