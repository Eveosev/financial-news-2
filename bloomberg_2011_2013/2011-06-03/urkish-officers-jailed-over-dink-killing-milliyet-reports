A Turkish court in Trabzon jailed six
gendarmerie officers in connection with the murder of Armenian
journalist Hrant Dink, Milliyet newspaper said.  Colonel Ali Oz, then commander of the gendarmerie at the
coastal city on the  Black Sea , and Captain Metin Yildiz of the
intelligence unit were sentenced to six months in prison,
according to the newspaper. The court also jailed four non-
commissioned officers for four months.  The officersâ€™ negligence and failure to act on intelligence
that Dink would be assassinated amounts to abetting the killing,
Milliyet said, quoting Engin Cinmen, who represents the family
of the deceased publisher of the Agos newspaper.  Dink was shot dead outside his office in Istanbul on Jan.
