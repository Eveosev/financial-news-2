Hornby Plc (HRN) , a U.K. maker of model
train sets, reported that after-tax profit in the fiscal year to
March 31 fell 23 percent to 2.86 million pounds ($4.67 million),
on revenue that was little changed at 63.37 million pounds.  Total comprehensive income, including cash-flow hedges, net
of tax, fell 52 percent to 2.2 million pounds.  The company said sales were damped by the failure of its
biggest supplier in  China  to meet volume requirements.  The full-year dividend was maintained at 5 pence a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
