Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, plans to begin flights to Libya
and Tunisia within three years.  “It was always in our plan to open up Tripoli and Tunisia,
more so with the African Development Bank being based there, and
also with North Africa starting to look south,” Chief Executive
Officer Titus Naikuni said in an interview in the capital,
 Nairobi , yesterday. Talks between the airline and the Kenyan,
Libyan and Tunisian governments have been slowed by political
instability in the two North African nations, he said.  The airline’s only route in North Africa is to  Egypt .
Kenya’s national carrier will add eight new destinations this
year, including the capitals of  Nigeria , Chad, Togo and  Burkina
Faso , as well as Mauritius and the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah,
in 2011. Nairobi-based Kenya Airways, also known as KQ, plans to
double the size of its fleet to 60 in the next four years.  Kenya Airways is training 100 pilots who will be ready to
fly its fleet in the next two years, Naikuni said. The carrier,
which had 177 pilots in 2002, has 377 pilots, short of the 500
it requires to be optimally staffed, he said. It may look to
hire foreign pilots to cover the gap, Naikuni said.  South African Airways and Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise are
sub-Saharan Africa’s two biggest carriers, according to IATA,
which represents more than 230 airlines making up about 93
percent of scheduled international air traffic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
