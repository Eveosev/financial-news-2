Hungary  plans to earmark 5 billion
forint ($27.3 million) next year for its National Asset Manager,
which was set up to buy non-performing foreign-currency mortgage
loans from banks at discounted prices, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said in an interview with Figyelo’s website  fn.hu .  The asset manager will also build new homes, Matolcsy said,
according to the news website.  Hungary set up the asset manager this week to help those
who can’t repay installments on their foreign-currency mortgage
loans and who face foreclosure after an eviction moratorium
expires on July 1.  The asset manager will buy mortgages from banks, acquiring
ownership of the real estate and allowing the borrower to rent
the property back.  To contact the reporters on this story:
