G2 Investment Group, the firm run by
J. Todd Morley, has started a natural resources unit to invest
in assets such as early stage mining and energy.  The unit, G2 Natural Resources LLC, is led by Douglas Wu
and has investments in gold and copper mines, as well as in
shale gas, the company said today in a statement from  New York .  Morley said his firm is investing in physical assets
because the “frightening” state of U.S. and European fiscal
and monetary policies threatens erode the value of currencies
and debt. The firm plans to add a commodity trading arm focused
on energy resources including coal and uranium, Morley said in a
phone interview.  G2 “will be accessing mines where our joint venture
partners can prove out the assets and bring their geological
expertise to the table,” Morley said. “We’re working on
smaller off-the-beat assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
