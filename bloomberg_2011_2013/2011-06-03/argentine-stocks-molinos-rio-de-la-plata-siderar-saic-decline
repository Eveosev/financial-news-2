The following companies had unusual

company and soy processor that gets most of its revenue from
markets outside of  Argentina , declined 1.9 percent to 25.90
pesos. Shares have fallen 12 percent in three days. Molinos had
risen 103 percent in the year prior to May 31.  Siderar SAIC (ERAR)  ,  Ternium SA (TX) ’s Argentine unit,
dropped 0.7 percent to 28.20 pesos after the government declined
a request by the country’s largest steel producer to set anti-
dumping levies on steel imports from Brazil, Russia and Ukraine,
according to the El Cronista newspaper, which cited unnamed
sources. Ternium and the Argentine government are in a legal
fight over the government’s shareholder rights in Siderar, in
which it holds a 26 percent stake, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
