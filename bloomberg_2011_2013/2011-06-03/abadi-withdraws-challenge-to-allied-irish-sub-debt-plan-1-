New York investment bank Abadi & Co.
withdrew a challenge to a court order changing the terms and
conditions of subordinated debt at  Allied Irish Banks Plc. (ALBK)   Abadi lawyer John Rogers announced the withdrawal at a
hearing at the  High Court  in Dublin today.  Ireland’s government, which owns 93 percent of Allied
Irish, sought the court order to enable the bank to buy back
subordinated bonds at discounted value. Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  is seeking ways to share the cost of bank rescues after
the government sought a bailout last year. Rogers said today the
company will participate in the buyback.  Noonan welcomed the withdrawal, saying in a statement today
that it “entirely vindicates my view and that of the government
that the challenges were unfounded.”  He also said the cost of the financial crisis “should not
be borne entirely” by taxpayers and that no financial incentive
was made or offered to Abadi, “other than a payment in respect
of their legal costs.”  Aurelius Capital Management LP, which has also challenged
the court order, had its court date postponed until June 7. At
the hearing today, Judge John Cooke said that as Aurelius only
owns two of 18 subordinated-debt categories relating to the
order in April, the order may stand for the other 16 categories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
