People sickened by the E. coli
outbreak in  Germany  ate more salad than healthy individuals in
two epidemiological studies, Germany’s disease control agency
said today in an e-mailed statement.  About 95 percent of the patients who became ill had eaten
either lettuce, tomatoes or cucumbers, the Robert Koch Institute
said. The agency’s advisory against eating the three products
remains in place, according to the statement.  Employees who ate at a salad bar at an unnamed office
cafeteria in  Frankfurt  where illnesses were reported were nearly
seven times more likely to experience frequent bloody diarrhea
as those who didn’t eat salad, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
