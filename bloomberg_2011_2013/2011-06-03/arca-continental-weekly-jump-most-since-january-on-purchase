Continental SAB and the two started trading as one company.  Arca Continental surged 9.7 percent to 77.23 pesos this
week in  Mexico  City trading, the biggest jump since the week
ending Jan. 28. The stock gained 2.9 percent today.  The companies completed the acquisition and listed as a

Gerardo Copca, an equity analyst at Metanalisis SA in Mexico
City. “The financial state of the group is very solid.”  Mexico’s IPC index of 37 stocks fell 0.8 percent to
