South Korea ’s won headed for the
biggest weekly gain since April, reflecting reduced demand for
dollars after Moody’s Investors Service said the U.S. was at
risk of losing its Aaa credit rating.  The company said yesterday it expects to place the rating
under review for a possible downgrade unless there is progress
on increasing the debt limit by mid-July. European Union and
International Monetary Fund officials will complete today a
review of  Greece ’s plan for 78 billion euros ($113 billion) in
asset sales and austerity measures as they prepare the nation’s
second bailout in little more than a year.  “Optimism about euro-zone debt issues and concerns about
the  U.S. economy  and its rating” underpinned the won’s gains,
said Byeon Ji Young, a currency analyst at Woori Futures Co. in
 Seoul . “Concerns that the South Korean authorities won’t
tolerate rapid won gains are limiting appreciation.”  The won advanced 0.6 percent this week, the most since the
five-day period ended April 29, to 1,075.60 per dollar as of
9:51 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency gained 0.5 percent today.  The government’s benchmark three-year bonds were little
changed this week. The yield on the 3 percent note due December
2013 was 3.60 percent, according to prices from Korea Exchange
Inc. The rate rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
