Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Canada ’s
second-largest bank, expects expansion in its U.S. operations
will make up for weakness in the Canadian economy, Chief
Executive Officer Edmund Clark said.  “We do actually think now the U.S. is going to pick up a
little bit from slowing Canadian operations,” said Clark,
speaking today on Bloomberg Television in  New York . Clark cited
gains in market share by the Toronto-based lender.  Toronto-Dominion said May 26 that profit in the fiscal
second quarter rose 13 percent to C$1.33 billion ($1.36
billion), or C$1.46 a share, bolstered by gains at its U.S.
banking business. Toronto-Dominion has spent more than
$25 billion in the past six years south of the Canadian border.  Clark reiterated that Toronto-Dominion will continue to
look at “small, tuck-in” acquisitions in the U.S. He declined
to comment on whether the bank would be interested in buying the
upstate New York operations of  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   Clark also said the Canadian economy “may well grow slower
than it has previously.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
