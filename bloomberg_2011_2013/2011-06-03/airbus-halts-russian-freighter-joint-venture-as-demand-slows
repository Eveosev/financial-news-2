Airbus SAS said it will suspend a
joint venture with  Russia â€™s United Aircraft Corp. converting
narrowbody jetliners to cargo planes as demand has dropped and
used jets are being bought for passenger use.  More demand for new and secondhand A320 and A321 single-
aisle passenger jetliners, and less for freighter versions led
to the decision, Toulouse, France-based Airbus said today in an
e-mailed statement.  Airbus, OAO  Irkut Corp. (IRKT)  and UAC have been partners in the
conversion venture for four years, Airbus said. When Irkut
signed a deal in October 2006, Airbus said it wanted the Russian
partnership eventually to have about half the world market for
conversion of single-aisle aircraft.  Irkut and Airbus will continue making components for the
single-aisle jet program, according to the statement.  Airbus is a division of European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
