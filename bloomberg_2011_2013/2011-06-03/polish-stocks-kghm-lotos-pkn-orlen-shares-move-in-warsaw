Poland ’s WIG20 Index declined for a
third day, losing 12.23, or 0.4 percent, to close at 2,883.82 by
the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in Warsaw and trimming this
week’s gain to 0.6 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, fell
for a third day, losing 0.75 zloty, or 1.4 percent, to 52.25
zloty. Oil retreated as the U.S. jobless rate climbed to the
highest level this year, sparking concern that fuel demand will
decline.  Sygnity SA (SGN)   jumped 1.13 zloty, or 4.4 percent, to
26.63 zloty, the highest close since November 2008, as Bank
Zachodni WBK SA raised its share-price estimate for the  software
developer  to 30 zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
