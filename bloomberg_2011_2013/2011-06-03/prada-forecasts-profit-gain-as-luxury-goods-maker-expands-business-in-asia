Prada SpA, the Italian  luxury-goods 
company planning to sell shares in an initial public offering,
forecast growth of at least 46 percent in first-half profit as
it opens more stores in Asia.  Net income in the six months ending July 31 is unlikely to
be less than 150.7 million euros ($218 million), Milan-based
Prada said today in a filing to the Hong Kong exchange. The
maker of Miu Miu bags and Church’s shoes reported profit of 103
million for the same period of last year.  The company, which had 319 directly operated stores at the
end of January, said it plans to open about 80 new outlets in
the current fiscal year, including 25 boutiques in  Asia  Pacific.
Prada expects to add about 70 directly operated stores in the
region by Jan. 31, 2014, including more than 30 in  China .  “We believe that there is still substantial potential for
growth in Asia Pacific,” Prada said in the filing.  Prada, which has set June 24 as a tentative listing date,
follows European companies including L’Occitane International SA
in seeking to sell shares in Hong Kong, where IPOs reached a
record last year. By listing there, the Italian company is
aiming to tap local funds as individual investors bet on the
luxury-goods industry’s growth in Asia. Bagmakers  Coach Inc. (COH)  and
Samsonite LLC are also planning to sell shares in  Hong Kong .  Chinese Growth  Mainland China will remain the fastest-growing market for
luxury goods in 2011 as sales rise 25 percent to 11.5 billion
euros, consulting company Bain & Co. said May 3. The country is
on course to become the world’s third-largest luxury market in
five years, it predicted.  Prada said today that profit attributable to the owners of
the company in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31 was 250.8 million
euros. Net revenue in the year was 2.05 billion euros.  Miu Miu , the maker of 595-euro patent-leather clutches, was
Prada’s fastest-growing brand last year, with sales rising 40
percent to 354.5 million euros, the company said. Asia Pacific
accounted for 35 percent of the brand’s revenue. Prada said it
plans to increase the number of Miu Miu’s directly operated
stores in the region to 55 from 25 by Jan. 31, 2014.  As well as increasing “significantly” investment in
marketing and communications, Prada plans to host a Miu Miu
fashion show in  Shanghai  this year “to enhance its growing
brand recognition in Asia,” the company also said.  Leather Brogues  Sales at the Prada brand climbed 30 percent to 1.61 billion
euros in the 12 months through Jan. 31, the company said.
Revenue at  Church’s , the Northampton, England-based maker of
375-euro leather brogues, rose 21 percent to 53.1 million euros,
while revenue at the Car Shoe brand fell 3.2 percent to 17.9
million euros, the company said.  Intesa Sanpaolo, Credit Agricole SA’s CLSA Asia-Pacific
Markets, Goldman Sachs and UniCredit SpA are managing the IPO.
Mizuho and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. are
providing assistance as so-called joint leads, according to
three people familiar with the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
