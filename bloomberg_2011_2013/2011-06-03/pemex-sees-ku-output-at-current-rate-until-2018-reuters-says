Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned
 oil company , may maintain output of 850,000 barrels of oil a day
at its Ku-Maloob-Zaap field for seven more years, extending the
field’s life by two years, Reuters said.  Pemex, as the Mexico City-based company is known, expects
output from the Cantarell field to range between 530,000 barrels
a day and 540,000 until 2016, Reuters reported, citing Carlos Morales, head of the exploration and production unit.
Cantarell’s production will decline after that year, he said.  Ku-Maloob-Zaap, Pemex’s largest field, and Cantarell, the
second-largest, are offshore projects in the Gulf of Mexico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
