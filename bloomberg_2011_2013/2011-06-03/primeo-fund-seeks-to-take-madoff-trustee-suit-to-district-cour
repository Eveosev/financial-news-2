Primeo Fund, sued along with  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  by the trustee liquidating  Bernard Madoff ’s firm,
will ask a district judge to remove the case from bankruptcy
court.  Trustee Irving Picard sued HSBC and a dozen so-called
feeder funds including Primeo for $9 billion in December, saying
they should have known of the fraud. Primeo, based in the Cayman
Islands, will follow HSBC,  Europe ’s biggest lender, in asking a
higher court to review Picard’s claims against it, according to
a court filing yesterday.  Primeo, which is being liquidated, was a fund tied to Bank
Medici AG and its founder Sonja Kohn that invested in Madoff’s
firm and other feeders such as Alpha Prime, according to
Picard’s suit. Primeo took $145 million, mostly its principal,
out of the Madoff firm in the six years before the 2008
bankruptcy, which Picard is seeking to recover, he said in the
suit. Its profit was a scant $27,942, according to Picard.  The trustee put total six-year withdrawals by funds he
named in the HSBC suit at $2 billion.  HSBC has asked U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in  New York 
to dismiss Picard’s suit, saying it didn’t know of the fraud and
lost $1 billion of its own money investing in funds that in turn
put money with Madoff.  Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison in
North Carolina.  Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, declined to comment.  The HSBC appeal is Irving H. Picard v. HSBC Bank Plc, 11-
cv-0763, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
