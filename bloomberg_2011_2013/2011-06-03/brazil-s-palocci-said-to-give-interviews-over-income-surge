Brazil ’s Cabinet Chief  Antonio Palocci  will give a television interview today, his first since
it was reported his income surged while he managed President
Dilma Rousseff’s campaign last year, a government official said.  The interview with Globo TV is being taped this afternoon
in Brasilia, said the official, who is familiar with the plans
though could not be named because he’s not authorized to speak
publicly on the subject.  Palocci also will give an interview with Folha de S.Paulo
newspaper, the official said. The Sao Paulo-based newspaper
reported May 20 that Palocci made 20 million reais ($12 million)
last year, while he was a congressman and managed Rousseff’s
election campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
