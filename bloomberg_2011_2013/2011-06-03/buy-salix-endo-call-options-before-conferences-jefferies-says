Investors should buy bullish  Salix
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (SLXP)  and  Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. (ENDP) 
options before the drugmakers make presentations at investor
conferences this month, Jefferies Group Inc. said.  Eric Sonis, a Boston-based strategist, recommended buying
July $41 call options on Salix, the maker of the antibiotic
Xifaxan that may be approved to treat irritable bowel syndrome,
and July $45 calls to buy Endo, maker of the painkiller
Percocet. Salix fell 0.9 percent to $38.70 at 4 p.m. in New York
as Endo fell 1.9 percent to $40.75. Corey Davis, Jefferies’
analyst for the companies, has a “buy” rating on shares of
both Salix and Endo.  Salix, based in Morrisville,  North Carolina , “has done a
good job filling out its pipeline and we expect renewed investor
focus on Relistor, a currently approved drug for pain,” the
strategists wrote. Endo, of  Chadds Ford , Pennsylvania, will
probably increase its estimate for 2011 earnings after managers
were “very conservative” on their first-quarter earnings
conference call, Jefferies said.  Salix is scheduled to make presentations at three
conferences this month, including the Jefferies Global
Healthcare Conference on June 6 and Goldman Sachs Global
Healthcare Conference on June 8, according to Bloomberg data.
Endo presents at the Jefferies conference on June 7 and at
Goldman’s on June 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
