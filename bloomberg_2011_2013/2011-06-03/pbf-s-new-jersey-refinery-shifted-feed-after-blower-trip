PBF Energy Co. LLC shifted feed to
another unit after a blower trip caused emissions from a tail
gas unit yesterday, according to a  filing  with the National
Response Center.  The incident caused the release of about 100 pounds of
hydrogen sulfide, according to the filing.  A gas release and a 45-minute evacuation of a nearby high
school were reported on NJ.com, a local news website. An “all
clear” was given at 9:15 a.m. local time yesterday for students
to return to class, NJ.com said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
