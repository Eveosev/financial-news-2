Distell Group Ltd. (DST)  will be taxed at a
higher rate on 15 of its cream liquers, Business Day said,
citing a Gauteng High Court ruling.  The liquers will be taxed at a rate applicable to spirit
drinks rather than the lower wine-based category, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
