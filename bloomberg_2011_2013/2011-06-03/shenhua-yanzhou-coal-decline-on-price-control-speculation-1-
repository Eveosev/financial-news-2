China  Shenhua Energy Co. and Yanzhou
Coal Mining Co. dropped the most in a year in Hong Kong trading
on speculation that the Chinese government may start controlling
prices of the fuel in the spot market.  Shares of Shenhua fell 6.4 percent to HK$35.80, the biggest
decline since May 25, 2010. Yanzhou declined 6.2 percent to
HK$30.10, the most since June 28, 2010. The benchmark  Hang Seng
Index  retreated 1.3 percent.  The National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top
economic planner, will focus on “adjusting power prices and
restricting movements in coal prices” in its efforts to manage
the economy, the Shanghai Securities News reported, citing
unidentified government officials.  “The news may have triggered a sell-off in both Shenhua
and Yanzhou today because investors are concerned about price
interference from the government,”  Helen Lau , a Hong Kong-based
analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone.  China Coal Energy Co. fell 2.7 percent to HK$10.02, the
biggest drop since May 16.  --Wang Ying. Editors: Ryan Woo, John Chacko.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
