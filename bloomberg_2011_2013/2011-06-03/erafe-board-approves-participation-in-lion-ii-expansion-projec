Merafe Resources Ltd. (MRF)  agreed to join
 Xstrata Plc (XTA)  in a project to expand the world’s biggest producer
of ferrochrome and will fund its 1 billion-rand ($149 million)
contribution with cash, debt and future revenue.  The companies will construct a 360,000 metric-ton smelter,
raising annual ferrochrome capacity of their joint venture in
northern  South Africa  to 2.3 million tons, Johannesburg-based
Merafe said in a statement today. The company owns 20.5 percent
of the Xstrata-Merafe Chrome Venture, supplier of about a fifth
of world demand for ferrochrome, used to make stainless steel.  Merafe decided against exercising an option to increase its
stake in the venture to as high as 26 percent, which would have
required funds from a sale of new shares, because of conditions
in the equity market, it said. The company, which rose 0.8
percent to 1.23 rand at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, has
fallen 26 percent in 2011 as costs have risen and demand for
stainless steel remains subdued.  Production from the new smelter is scheduled to begin in
the first half of 2013, by which time the market is expected to
be short of supply, Merafe said. Chief Executive Officer Stuart Elliot wasn’t available when Bloomberg News phoned his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
