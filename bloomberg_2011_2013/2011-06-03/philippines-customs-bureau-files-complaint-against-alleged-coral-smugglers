The Philippines’ Bureau of Customs
filed a smuggling complaint against several individuals for
alleged attempted smuggling of ilegally-harvested black corals
and other endangered marine species worth 35 million pesos
($810,000), Commissioner Angelito Alvarez said in a press
briefing today.  Two container vans from a province in the south were
intercepted in  Manila  in early May, loaded with 21,169 pieces of
black corals, 163 stuffed hawkbills and green turtles and other
marine species, Alvarez said.  Poachers may have decimated an entire reef complex almost
twice as big as the Philippine capital when it harvested the
black corals, Philippine Daily Inquirer reported on May 25,
citing marine biologist Ludivina Labe of the Bureau of Fisheries
and Aquatic Resources. Almost a fourth of the world’s ocean fish
live in coral reefs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
