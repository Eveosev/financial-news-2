The units of Greek banks in  Bulgaria 
and elsewhere in the Balkans have very good capitalization
levels,  ANA  said, citing Bulgarian National Bank Governor Ivan Iskrov.  Greek bank units in Bulgaria,  Romania ,  Serbia  and elsewhere
in the western Balkans also have sufficiently high liquidity
levels so there is no reason at the moment to talk about any
problems especially as the Greek parent companies are in “good
condition,” the state-run  news agency  quoted the Bulgarian
central bank chief as saying in an interview.  Greek banks are a pillar of stability in the Bulgarian
banking system, ANA cited Iskrov as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
