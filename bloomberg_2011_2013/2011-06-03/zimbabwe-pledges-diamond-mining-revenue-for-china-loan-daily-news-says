Zimbabwe will use revenue from its
Marange diamond field to repay  China ’s Anhui Foreign Economic
Construction Group Ltd. for building a military training
facility, the  Daily News  reported, citing documents and a
parliamentary debate.  The $98 million loan agreement was signed by Finance
Minister Tendai Biti on March 21, although it hasn’t been
ratified by parliament yet, the Harare-based newspaper reported
on its website. Zimbabwe is in a joint-venture with Anjin
Investments Ltd., a unit of state-owned Anhui, to mine gems at
Marange.  Anhui is providing some workers to build the defense
college, the Daily News said, citing Labor Minister Paurina
Mpariwa. A committee was set up to investigate accusations of
abuse of Zimbabwean workers by Chinese employers, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
