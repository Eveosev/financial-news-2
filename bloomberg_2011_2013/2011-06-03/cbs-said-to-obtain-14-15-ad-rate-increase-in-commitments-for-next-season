CBS is obtaining advertising rate
increases of 14 percent to 15 percent in commitments from
marketers for the TV season that starts in September, according
to a person with knowledge of the situation.  Those compare with a goal of an 18 percent year-over-year
increase for New York-based  CBS Corp. (CBS)  when annual upfront sales
began last month, said the person, who wasnâ€™t authorized to
speak publicly. The network continues to seek commitments for
the new season, the person said.  Shannon Jacobs, a spokeswoman for CBS, declined to comment
on upfront sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
