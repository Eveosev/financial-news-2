Overseas investors bought a net 1.51
billion rupees ($33.6 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
raising total investments in equity this year to 2 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 17.9 billion rupees of shares and sold
16.4 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They bought 5.41 billion rupees of bonds, taking
total debt purchases this year to 139.4 billion rupees.  Foreign funds bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. The Sensex has
fallen 10.5 percent this year.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18 years. Funds
pulled out a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.473 trillion rupees in equities and 926.1 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
