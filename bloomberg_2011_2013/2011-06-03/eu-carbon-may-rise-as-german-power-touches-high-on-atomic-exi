European Union carbon permits will
rise next week, UniCredit SpA said, after German power traded
this week at the highest price in almost two years on the
country’s nuclear phase-out plans.  EU permits for delivery in December dropped 0.5 percent
this week to close at 16.81 euros a metric ton on  London ’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange in shrinking volumes amid public
holidays in some European countries. The contract briefly
touched a 2 1/2-year high of 18.18 euros on May 31, one day
after  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s coalition endorsed a blueprint
to shut all its nuclear power plants by 2022.  “We believe that the CO2 price trend will continue to
point upward due to the final decision on the exit from nuclear
power,” UniCredit SpA said in a research note today. “For the
coming week we expect a price range of 16.80-17.50 euros a
metric ton.”  German baseload power for next year, a European benchmark,
ended the week unchanged at 59.55 euros a megawatt-hour,
according to broker prices on Bloomberg. The contract touched
60.90 euros on May 31, the highest since June 11, 2009.  A closure of nuclear  power plants , which are almost
emissions-free, will require more generation from coal and
natural gas plants, which require permits to discharge CO2.  The global carbon market shrank for the first time in 2010,
snapping five years of growth as a lack of clarity about the
future climate framework hurt investment in the hottest year on
record, a World Bank report showed on Wednesday.  The value of the market for greenhouse-gas permits and
credits for cutting pollution fell to $141.9 billion last year
from $143.7 billion in 2009, also because of fading prospects
for the introduction of emissions-trading programs in countries
including the U.S., according to the report published during the
Carbon Expo conference in  Barcelona ,  Spain .  The value of the EU market increased to $119.8 billion in
2010 from $118.5 billion, the report showed. The United Nations
Clean Development Mechanism shrank to the lowest level since the
 Kyoto Protocol  entered into force in 2005, with new project-
based transactions falling 46 percent to $1.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
