Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-run oil producer, raised its output target to 6 million
barrels a day in 10 years as it develops deep-water fields in
the Santos Basin, Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa said.  Petrobras, which currently produces about 2.6 million
barrels a day of oil and natural-gas equivalent, previously
expected to double output to 5.4 million barrels by 2020. The
company, based in  Rio de Janeiro , estimates the so-called pre-
salt fields off Brazil’s southeastern coast hold potential
reserves of 20 billion barrels, Barbassa said.  “This is a unique situation in the world,” he said at an
event today in Rio. It’s “such a large concentration of
discoveries.”  Petrobras last month cut planned investments in  Santos
Basin  deep-water fields by about 32 percent to $73 billion
through 2015 as it produces more than previously expected,
accelerating output gains and cutting costs. The company
estimates its Lula field in the basin has recoverable reserves
of about 6.5 billion barrels, while the Brazilian government’s
nearby Libra field has as much as 5 billion barrels.  Santos Basin also contains the Cernambi, Guara and Carioca
fields.  Petrobras fell 0.7 percent to 23.78 reais in Sao Paulo
trading. The stock has dropped 13 percent this year, compared
with a 7.2 percent decline in Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
