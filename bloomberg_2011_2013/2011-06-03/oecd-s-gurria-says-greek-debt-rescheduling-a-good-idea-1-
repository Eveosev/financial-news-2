OECD Secretary General Jose Angel Gurria said he thinks it would be a “good idea” for investors
to extend the maturities of  Greece ’s debt to allow the country
more time to implement fiscal restraint.  Gurria, head of the Paris-based Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, said a rescheduling of the
country’s debt would be in the interests of bondholders because
it increases the likelihood of repayment.  “I think it’s a good idea to extend the maturities of the
payments, give time for policies to work,” Gurria said in an
interview today in Ottawa, where he was attending a conference.
“Then, after a while, see if there needs to be a reduction in
the nominal size of the debt, which is generally known as
restructuring,” he said.  Policy makers have focused on bond rollovers as a pillar of
any new aid package for Greece. The step would be favored by the
 European Central Bank , according to two officials familiar with
the situation, because it would skirt the risk of any agreement
being classified as a default. Investors may be given preferred
status, higher coupon payments or collateral, said two other
European Union officials familiar with the situation.  A rescheduling “is in everybody’s interests,” Gurria
said. “It gives investors a better opportunity of being paid in
the end.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
