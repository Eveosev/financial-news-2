Stocks fell, dragging the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  to its longest streak of weekly losses since
2004, as slowing job growth added to signs the economy is
weakening. The euro rose as European officials worked toward a
second Greek bailout.  The Dow lost 97.29 points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,151.26 at
4 p.m. in New York, adding to its fifth straight weekly loss.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1 percent. The euro
strengthened 1 percent to $1.4637 as the Dollar Index slumped
0.8 percent to 73.714. Treasuries rose, pushing yields on two-
year notes to a seven-month low of 0.41 percent. The S&P GSCI
Index of commodities climbed 0.2 percent.  The Dow and S&P 500 slumped to the lowest levels since
March after payrolls grew by 54,000 in May, trailing the median
economist estimate of 165,000, and the jobless rate unexpectedly
climbed to 9.1 percent. The report followed lower-than-estimated
data on factory orders, manufacturing and  consumer confidence ,
spurring speculation the  Federal Reserve  may consider a third
round of quantitative easing, or “QE3,” to bolster growth.  “There’s a persistency here,”  Bill Gross , who runs the
world’s biggest mutual fund at Pacific Investment Management
Co., said in a radio interview today on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “It’s back to our old new
normal. We don’t see a QE3. There’s been too much discussion and
dissent within the Fed to permit that type of program again.
What we do see is an extension of the language, speaking to an
‘extended period of time.’”  Newell Rubbermaid  All 10 industries in the S&P 500 fell, led by telephone,
technology and consumer companies reliant on discretionary
spending, which lost at least 1.4 percent. Alcoa Inc., DuPont
Co. and Walt Disney Co. dropped 1.7 percent or more to lead
declines in 27 of 30 Dow stocks.  Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NWL) , the maker of Rubbermaid containers,
sank 12 percent for its biggest decline since 2008 after cutting
its full-year profit forecast because of slumping consumer
spending. Some of Newell’s larger retail customers have lowered
expectations for U.S. growth as consumer confidence weakens,
Chief Executive Officer Mark Ketchum said.  The euro extended gains against the dollar after European
Union and International Monetary Fund officials agreed to pay
the next installment to  Greece  under last year’s 110 billion-
euro ($161 billion) bailout, paving the way for an upgraded aid
package that includes a “voluntary” role for investors.  Missing Forecasts  Data on the economy is trailing forecasts by the widest
margin since the bull market began in March 2009, according to
the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S. At the same
time, stock analysts have been boosting estimates for  S&P 500 
profit growth. Companies in the index are projected to earn
$105.31 a share over the next 12 months, compared with $96.92 at
the beginning of January, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Based on that profit estimate, the S&P 500 is trading at a
price-earnings ratio of 12.3, compared with an average forward
multiple of 14.7 since 2006, the data show. Income has beaten
analyst estimates for nine straight quarters. The index is
priced at 1.3 times reported sales, down from a 32-month high of
1.4 in February, and 2.2 times book value, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Michael Shaoul , whose Marketfield Fund Ltd. beat 81 percent
of competitors last year with investments in transportation and
retail companies, said private sector hiring has risen by an
average 145,000 a month over the last year, faster than
economists had predicted. He noted that smaller gains in nonfarm
payrolls reported in February and July 2004 failed to derail the
last  bull market , which peaked in October 2007.  ‘Surprisingly Little’  “What the data will do, however, is accelerate the process
of economic revision, with estimates of U.S. growth being forced
significantly lower across the board,” Shaoul wrote in a note
to clients. “As damaging as the process may be for asset
values, it has surprisingly little to do with the actual ability
of corporations to generate revenue.”  Gross’ Pacific Investment Management warned in May 2009
that returns on financial assets would trail historical averages
because of higher deficits and regulation, a phenomenon the firm
called “new normal.” U.S. equities have returned 6.2 percent a
year since 1900 before dividends, according to inflation-
adjusted data compiled by the  London  Business School and Credit
Suisse Group AG in Zurich.  Since March 2009, the S&P 500 has returned 37 percent
annually, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The year
return falls to negative 2.8 percent from the market peak on
Oct. 10, 2007, the data show. The benchmark gauge for American
equities has returned 2.3 percent annually over the past five
and years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  VIX Drops  The benchmark index for U.S. stock options and the S&P 500
fell, breaking their pattern of moving in opposite directions,
as lower-than-estimated job growth failed to spur traders to pay
more for insurance against equity losses. The VIX, as the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is known, fell
1.1 percent to 17.90. The index measures the cost of using
options as protection against declines in the S&P 500.  “There’s no panic,” said Jonathan Bensimon, head of
equities and derivatives trading for the Americas at Societe
Generale SA in  New York . “The figure was bad so the market
deserves to go a little lower, but no one thinks that there will
be a big selloff.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
