Gold may fall for a second day in  New
York  on speculation some investors will sell the metal after
prices climbed near a record.  Gold futures this week rose to within 1.7 percent of a
record set last month. European Union and International Monetary
Fund officials will today complete a review of  Greece ’s plan for
78 billion euros ($113 billion) in asset sales and austerity
measures as they prepare the nation’s second bailout in little
more than a year. Economist  Dennis Gartman  said he cut his gold
position by a half this morning.  “We rose too far, too fast,” Jim Pogoda, an investor in
Summit,  New Jersey , and a former precious-metals trader for
Mitsubishi International Corp., said in an e-mail. Still, “the
bullish arguments - euro-zone debt fears, continued unrest and
potential for spreading in the  Middle East  and north Africa
region, and poor long-term prospects for the dollar - remain
intact.”  Gold for August delivery fell $2.50, or 0.2 percent, to
$1,530 an ounce by 7:58 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The metal
is down 0.5 percent this week. Immediate-delivery gold was 0.3
percent lower at $1,529.47 in London.  Bullion declined to $1,531 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,539.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. Fifteen
of 17 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, or
88 percent, said bullion will rise next week. One predicted
lower prices and one was neutral.  Gartman Position  “We fear that yesterday’s sharp break that took gold down
to $1,520 in the veritable twinkling of an eye was the harbinger
of even more severe weakness that might soon develop,” said
Gartman, editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter.
“We fear the possibility that gold might swiftly fall to $1,480
or so over the course of the next few days or weeks.”  Concern about faster inflation,  Europe ’s debt crisis, a
weakening dollar and fighting in  Libya  boosted gold to a record
$1,577.40 on May 2. Prices are up 7.6 percent in 2011 after
climbing the past 10 years, the longest run of gains in at least
nine decades in London.  The dollar was little changed near a four-week low against
six major currencies before a report that may show U.S.
employers probably hired fewer workers in May. Manufacturing in
 China , Europe and the U.S. slowed last month.  Silver for July delivery fell 1.7 percent to $35.585 an
ounce in New York. Palladium for September delivery rose 0.2
percent to $772 an ounce. Platinum for July delivery was down
0.2 percent at $1,814.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
