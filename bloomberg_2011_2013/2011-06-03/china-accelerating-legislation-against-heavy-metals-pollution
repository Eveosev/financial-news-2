China  is accelerating the passage of
legislation aimed at preventing heavy metals pollution, said Li
Ganjie, vice environmental protection minister.  Authorities will also suspend giving approvals for
construction projects in regions where lead pollution has been
reported, Li said at a briefing in Beijing today. The government
will also halt the operations of companies found to have hidden
environmental hazards, Li said. He didnâ€™t give details about the
proposed legislation.  China has suspended production at battery makers and
recycled lead producers in the provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong,
Sichuan and Henan in a bid to control heavy metals poisonings.
The legal representative of a battery plant in Zhejiang was
detained last month after more than 300 people, including 99
children, living near the facility showed elevated levels of
lead in their blood, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  The nation has made heavy metal contamination and soil
pollution two of its environment priorities for the so-called
12th five-year plan period that covers the time from 2011
through 2015, Li said.  --William Bi. Editor:  John Liu   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
