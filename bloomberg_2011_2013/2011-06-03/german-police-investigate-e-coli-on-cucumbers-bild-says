Police in Hamburg are investigating
two wholesalers and a restaurant in connection with E. coli
found on cucumbers, Bild reported on its  website  today, citing
police spokesman Mirko Streiber.  The cucumbers do not contain the strain of EHEC, or
enterohemorrhagic E. coli bacteria, that is responsible for the
outbreak that has killed as many as 18 in  Germany , Streiber told
N24 in a television interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
