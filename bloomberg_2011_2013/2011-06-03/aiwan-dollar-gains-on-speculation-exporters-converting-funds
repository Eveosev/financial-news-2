Taiwan ’s dollar had its biggest
weekly advance since April on speculation exporters were
repatriating earnings because they expect the currency to
strengthen further.  Foreign investors bought $930 million more local stocks
than they sold this week, after $996 million of net sales in the
previous five days, according to exchange data. The  Taiwan
dollar  will advance 1.6 percent to NT$28.30 against its U.S.
counterpart by the end of the year, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Government bonds 
were little changed before the central bank auctions NT$40
billion ($1.4 billion) of 10-year bonds on June 7.  “Many exporters keep selling the  U.S. dollar  in the past
two weeks before potential further appreciation of the Taiwan
dollar,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader
at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “The currency may test the
NT$28.50 level next week.”  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.5 percent this week to
NT$28.750 against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local
time close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched
NT$28.558 on June 1, the strongest level since May 11. It
climbed 0.1 percent today. Taiwanese financial markets will be
shut on June 6 for a public holiday.  Consumer prices increased 1.60 percent in May from a year
earlier, the most since February 2010, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before data due
June 7. The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by
12.5 basis points to 1.75 percent in March. It will review
borrowing costs again on June 30.  Bond Investors Waiting  The yield on the 1.375 percent security due March 2021, the
most-traded government debt, rose one basis point to 1.423
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, this week.  “Investors are waiting for the bond auction result,” said
George Pu, a fixed-income trader at President Securities Corp.
in Taipei. “The yield had a big drop on June 2 following the
Treasuries, so it’s a consolidation for today. Inflation and
rate-rise expectations are pretty much priced in. I can see 10-
year yields going further downwards.”  The overnight rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, fell one basis point to 0.332 percent, snapping a
six-day advance, according to a weighted average compiled by
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
