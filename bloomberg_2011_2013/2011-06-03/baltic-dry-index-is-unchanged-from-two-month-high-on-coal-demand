The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of
global commodity shipping costs, was unchanged from a two-month
high as strengthening coal demand helped constrain the supply of
some vessel types.  The index matched yesterday’s 1,489 points, the highest
level since April 4, according to the London-based exchange. It
was the first time the gauge stayed unchanged since March. The
biggest move in freight costs was for iron ore-carrying capesize
vessels, which gained 1.9 percent to $11,773 a day.  Supply of smaller vessels including panamaxes and
supramaxes is being limited by strengthening demand in the North
Atlantic for shipments of coal and other minerals, Alex Gray,
chief executive officer of Clarkson Securities Ltd., said by
phone today.  “The one notable issue is that the panamax market in the
Atlantic, which everyone has been uncertain and negative about,
has proved itself to be quite tight in supply,” Gray said.  Daily rents for panamaxes that compete with capesizes for
cargoes and also transport grains were little changed at $14,360
a day. Supramaxes declined 0.7 percent to $15,004 a day, while
handysizes slipped 0.6 percent to $11,365.  U.S. coal exports rose to a 20-year high after floods in
 Australia  disrupted supply of the variety used to make steel,
Simpson, Spence & Young Ltd., the world’s second-largest
shipbroker, said May 23.  Shipments climbed to an annual rate of 96 million metric
tons in the first quarter, the most since the 99.3 million tons
reached in 1991, according to SSY.  To contact the reporter on this story:
