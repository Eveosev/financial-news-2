U.S. ratings companies will limit the
severity of their assessments of the nation’s creditworthiness
to avoid causing investor panic, Yu Yongding, a former Chinese
central bank adviser, said today.  “At this moment, any serious downgrading, say from AAA to
AA, will cause panic, and hence, they will not really downgrade
the U.S. securities,” Yu, who was also previously head of the
Institute of World Economics & Politics at the  Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences , said in e-mailed comments today.  Moody’s Investors Service said yesterday that it may put
the U.S. government’s Aaa credit rating under review for a
possible downgrade.  --Victoria Ruan. Editor: Paul Panckhurst, John Liu  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
