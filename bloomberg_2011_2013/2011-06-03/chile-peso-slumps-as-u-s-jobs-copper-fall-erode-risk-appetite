Chile ’s peso fell, capping the
biggest weekly slide in a month, after U.S. jobs data that
trailed forecasts eroded demand for riskier, emerging-market
assets, overshadowing a gain in copper prices.  The peso weakened 0.4 percent to 467.85 per  U.S. dollar  at
1:29 p.m.  New York  time, from 466.06 yesterday. The currency
weakened 0.2 percent this week, the most since May 6.  “It’s the jobs data that’s hitting U.S. stocks hard, and
that drags down the peso as reduced risk appetite is felt
throughout emerging markets,” said Eugenio Cortes, head of
currency forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index sank after U.S. employers
added in May the fewest workers in eight months and the
 unemployment rate  unexpectedly rose to 9.1 percent.  U.S. payrolls increased by 54,000 last month, less than
forecast, after a revised 232,000 gain in April that was smaller
than initially reported, Labor Department figures showed today
in Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called
for payrolls to rise 165,000 in May.  The jobless rate climbed to the highest level this year,
from 9 percent a month earlier.  Copper, which accounts for about half of Chile’s exports,
rose 1 percent in New York on signs of stronger demand in  China .  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 467.80 pesos per
U.S. dollar for $50 million today as part of a $12 billion
effort to limit the peso’s gains, the bank said on its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
