GT Solar International Inc. (SOLR) , a maker
of equipment to produce synthetic sapphires and polysilicon for
solar products, surged in early New York trading after winning a
$460.4 million order, its largest single contract.  GT Solar rose 88 cents, or 7.3 percent, to $12.91 at 9:40
a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The Merrimack, New
Hampshire-based company, which is changing its name to GT
Advanced Technologies Inc. in August, has more than doubled in
the past year.  GT Solar didnâ€™t name the customer in  China  that ordered
furnaces for manufacturing sapphires that are used in light-
emitting diodes and electronics. The company said in a statement
today that it plans to include the sale in its backlog for the
quarter ending July 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
