The  World Series  of Poker has added a
$1 million buy-in benefit tournament to be included in its 43rd
annual event in 2012.  The tournament will benefit  One Drop , which fights poverty
worldwide by supporting access to water. Commitments to enter
have been made by 15 participants including Guy Laliberté,
founder of Cirque du Soleil and chairman of the charity; Bobby Baldwin, chief executive officer of CityCenter Holdings LLC, and
Phil Ruffin, owner of Treasure Island Resort in Las Vegas.  Baldwin, a four-time gold bracelet winner in past
tournaments, will have a chance to add a platinum bracelet to
his collection with a win if at least 22 participants enter.  The three-day tournament is expected to begin July 1, 2012,
at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino in  Las Vegas , with a maximum
of 48 players putting up $1 million each. Organizers said 11
percent of each tournament buy-in would be donated to One Drop,
with $889,889 going to the prize pool. ESPN will broadcast the
event.  “Since its creation, One Drop has reached out to millions
of people to support access to water and raise each and every
one’s awareness of water-related issues.” Laliberté said in a
statement. “And today, knowing that one person dies from a
water-borne disease every 20 seconds, I urge everyone to do even
more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
