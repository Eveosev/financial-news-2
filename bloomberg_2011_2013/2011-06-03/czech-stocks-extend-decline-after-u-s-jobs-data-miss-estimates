The Czech Republicâ€™s benchmark equity
index extended declines, heading for the biggest drop in almost
seven weeks after a report showed the U.S. added fewer jobs than
estimated and unemployment unexpectedly rose.  The 15-member PX gauge tumbled 1.3 percent to 1,223.4 by
3:03 p.m. in Prague. A close at that level would mark the
steepest one-day decline since April 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
