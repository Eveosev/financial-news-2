U.S. stock futures slid, signaling
benchmark indexes may extend a fifth-straight weekly loss, after
lower-than-forecast growth in employment added to evidence the
economic recovery is faltering. Treasuries rallied.   Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring this
month lost 1.1 percent to 1,298.3 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York . Dow
Jones Industrial Average futures fell 119 points, or 1 percent,
to 12,119. The 10-year note yield lost eight basis points to 
2.95 percent, near its low of the year.   Payrolls increased by a less-than-projected 54,000 last
month, after a revised 232,000 gain in April that was smaller
than initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today
in  Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
called for payrolls to rise 165,000. The jobless rate climbed to
the highest level this year from 9 percent a month earlier.  The S&P 500 tumbled to a six-week low this week following
ADP Employer Services’ jobs report and separate data from the
 Institute for Supply Management  that showed manufacturing
expanded at the slowest pace in more than a year. Citigroup
Inc.’s U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which tracks the rate at
which data are beating or missing estimates, turned negative in
May and is near its lowest level since January 2009.  Stocks fell yesterday as more data showed the economic
recovery is slowing. Orders placed with U.S. factories fell in
April by the most in nearly a year as demand for aircraft waned
and  Japan ’s earthquake restrained auto-related supplies. A
separate report showed that more Americans than forecast filed
applications for  unemployment benefits  last week, signaling the
job market is weakening as employers trim staff to cut costs.  More than $652 billion has been erased from U.S. equity
markets since the  S&P 500  peaked at an almost three-year high of
1,363.61 on April 29, pushing the index’s valuation to 13.2
times estimated profit for 2011 from 13.8 times.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
