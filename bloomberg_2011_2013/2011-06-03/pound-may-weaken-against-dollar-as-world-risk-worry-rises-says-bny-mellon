The pound may weaken against the
dollar as the  Bank of England  maintains loose monetary policy
and rising global risk encourages investors to favor the U.S.
currency instead, according to Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  Money markets aren’t pricing in an increase in the central
bank’s key interest rate until February, according to sterling
overnight interbank average forwards, Tullett Prebon Plc data
show. As recently as February, investors were betting the rate
would be lifted when policy makers meet next week.  “All the signs are that policy remains on hold for the
foreseeable future,” BNY Mellon Chief Currency Strategist  Simon Derrick  wrote in an e-mailed note today. Global indicators such
as the falling Shanghai stock index are “flashing warning signs
about rising risk aversion, typically a dollar positive. We
wonder whether we may be about to see the start of a sustained
move lower in cable.”  Cable refers to the dollar-pound  exchange rate . The
Shanghai Composite has plunged 11 percent from this year’s high
on April 18 on concern Chinese economic growth is slowing.  The British currency slid 0.5 percent to $1.6298 as of 11
a.m. in  London , dragged down as data showed weaker growth in the
nation’s services industries. Sterling has slumped 2.4 percent
against the U.S. currency since the end of April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
