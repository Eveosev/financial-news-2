A plan by British Land Co. and
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  to build a new office block in the City of
London financial district received a setback after a state-
funded preservation group said the site should be protected.  The Broadgate Square complex was recommended for “listed”
status,  English Heritage  Ltd. said in a statement today. A
listed building cannot be demolished or altered without
government planning guidance, according to the group’s website.  The buildings at Broadgate Square “are one of the most
important and successful developments of its period and type,
possessing special architectural and historic interest,”
English Heritage, the official organization for archaeology,
heritage and conservation in  England , said in the statement.  British Land and New York-based Blackstone plan to
redevelop the site as a building for  UBS AG (UBSN)  of Zurich. The 13-
story development, which was approved by city planners in April,
is designed to have about 700,000 square feet (65,000 square
meters) of space.  The companies are seeking to demolish two of the buildings
at the Broadgate site. The government will now decide whether to
follow English Heritage’s recommendations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
