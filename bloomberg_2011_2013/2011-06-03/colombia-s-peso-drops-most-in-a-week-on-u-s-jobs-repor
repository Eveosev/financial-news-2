Colombia ’s peso fell the most in more
than a week after U.S. employers added in May the fewest workers
in eight months and unemployment unexpectedly rose, increasing
concern the recovery in the world’s biggest economy is slowing.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 1,788.05 per dollar at 11:17
a.m. New York time, from 1,784.50 yesterday. Today’s decline
pared the peso’s advance this week to 1.1 percent, its biggest
increase since the period ended April 8.  “People have been betting on a U.S. recovery, and today’s
numbers dampen that optimism,” said Daniel Escobar, an analyst
at Global Securities brokerage in Bogota.  U.S. payrolls increased by a less-than-projected 54,000
last month, after a revised 232,000 gain in April that was
smaller than initially reported, Labor Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey called for payrolls to rise 165,000. The jobless rate
climbed to 9.1 percent, the highest level this year, from 9
percent a month earlier.  The peso’s gain this week is driven by bets of increased
portfolio inflows into Colombia after the nation’s foreign debt
was raised to investment grade by Moody’s Investors Service, and
after  Standard & Poor’s  announced yesterday that it will
reclassify Colombia in its index as an emerging market from
frontier market, according to Escobar.  Moody’s on May 31 upgraded Colombia to Baa3, the lowest
level of investment grade, from Ba1. The move puts Colombia’s
rating on par with  Brazil ,  Peru  and  Panama . The outlook is
stable. Colombia was boosted to investment grade by Standard &
Poor’s on March 16.  Fitch Ratings rates Colombia’s foreign bonds BB+, one level
below investment grade, with a positive outlook.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.06 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s price fell
0.212 centavo to 115.330 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
