Iran  named former head of the
country’s Physical Education Organization Mohammad Aliabadi as
acting oil minister, state-run  Press TV  said yesterday, citing a
presidential directive.  Iran’s parliament voted on June 1 to ask the courts to
review whether President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  broke the law by
failing to appoint a temporary oil minister after he fired the
previous one and put himself in the caretaker role.  Ahmadinejad sacked Oil Minister Masoud Mir-Kazemi May 14 as
part of a plan to combine several ministries. The next day, he
appointed himself as caretaker for the Oil Ministry, citing the
importance of the oil industry in Iran’s national economy. The
move was promptly criticized by local industry experts and
described on May 20 as “unlawful” by the Guardian Council,
Iran’s top legal authority.  To contact the reporters on this story:
