Natural gas futures may decline on
speculation that record production will outstrip demand for the
fuel, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Eight of 15 analysts, or 53 percent, forecast that gas
futures will fall on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through
June 10. Five, or 33 percent, said futures will rise and two
predicted that prices will stay the same. Last week, 53 percent
of participants said gas prices would advance.  U.S. marketed natural gas production  averaged 64.8 billion
cubic feet a day in March, the highest monthly total in records
dating to 1973, according to the Energy Department. Output rose
above 65 billion cubic feet a day twice last week, the
department said, citing Evergreen, Colorado-based Bentek Energy
Services LLC.  Natural gas for July delivery climbed 27.6 cents, or 6.1
percent, to $4.794 per million British thermal units in the
first three days of trading this week on the New York exchange.
The futures are up 8.8 percent this year.  “U.S. marketed production has rocketed to a new all-time
high of 65.3 billion cubic feet a day, and as additional wells
come online from the nearly 700 wells awaiting completion, that
figure is going to rise even more,” said Alan Lammey, natural
gas markets analyst at WeatherBell Analytics LLC in Houston.  Marketed production excludes gas used for repressuring,
quantities vented and flared, and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in
treating or processing operations.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
rose by 15 last week to 881, according to data released May 27
by Baker Hughes Inc. Gas rigs climbed for the first time in
three weeks and were down 11 percent from the 2010 high of 992.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 48 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  5     8         2  To contact the reporter on this story:
