At least 150 foreign-owned mining
companies have submitted plans to  Zimbabwe ’s government showing
how they will cede control to black Zimbabweans,  Newsday said ,
citing Prince Mupazviriho, the secretary of mines.  The southern African nation’s black empowerment ministry
will review the proposals within the next three months, the
Harare-based newspaper said. Foreign miners will then have six
months to cede 51 percent of their shares to black Zimbabweans
once their proposals have been approved, Newsday said.  Foreign miners that haven’t submitted empowerment plans
will face legal action, the newspaper said, citing Mupazviriho.  To contact the reporter on this story:
