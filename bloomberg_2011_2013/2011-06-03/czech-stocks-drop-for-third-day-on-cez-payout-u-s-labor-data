The Czech Republic’s benchmark equity
index fell for a third day to a seven-week low as  CEZ AS (CEZ)  started
trading without the right to dividend and a U.S. labor report
added to concern the world’s largest economy is faltering.  The PX gauge of 15 companies dropped 0.7 percent to 1,231.6
at 4:28 p.m. in Prague, its lowest close since April 18, ending
the week with a 0.6 percent loss.  CEZ fell to 899.9 koruna from 940 koruna at yesterday’s
close as the country’s biggest power utility, which has a 22
percent weighting in the index, went ex-dividend. Removing the
effect of the 50 koruna payout, the stock advanced 1.1 percent.  “The Prague bourse declined significantly even before the
U.S. data, with the reason being the market’s largest stock has
lost the right to dividend,” Miroslav Adamkovic, an analyst at
Komercni Banka AS, wrote in a report to clients today.  The PX lost as much as 1.6 percent earlier after the U.S.
government said employers added fewer jobs than estimated and
the jobless rate unexpectedly increased, hurting investor demand
for riskier assets worldwide.  New World Resources Plc, the biggest Czech supplier of coal
to steelmakers, slid 4.6 percent to 240.3 koruna, extending its
loss so far this week to 12 percent. The stock slid 4.9 percent
yesterday after the company said its majority shareholder
offered to sell a stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
