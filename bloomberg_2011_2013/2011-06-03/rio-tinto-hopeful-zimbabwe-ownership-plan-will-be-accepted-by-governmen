Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  submitted its plans to
meet a Zimbabwe ownership law on May 9 and is “hopeful” the
proposal will be accepted, said Niels Kristensen, managing
director of the company’s operations in the country.  “Discussions are currently underway with government with a
view to finalizing the plan,” Kristensen said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. He didn’t give details of the proposal
to increase the ownership by black people in the company’s
Murowa diamond mine.  Zimbabwe gave foreign companies until yesterday to submit
plans to cede 51 percent of their assets to Zimbabweans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
