Polish day-ahead electricity fell in
the past week as imports from  Germany  added to supply and longer
days damped use.  Next-day baseload power decreased 0.6 percent to 210.48
zloty ($77.25) a megawatt-hour in the week ending today,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on Polish Power
Exchange data.  Demand for electricity at 9 p.m. local time yesterday was
19,067 megawatts, down 1.1 percent from a week earlier,
according to  system load data .  As much as 390 megawatts of Polish electricity was imported
from Germany yesterday, compared with as much as 700 megawatts
flowing in the opposite direction a week ago, according to data
from PSE Operator.  Maximum temperatures in Warsaw may rise to 34 degrees
Celsius (93 Fahrenheit) on June 9 from todayâ€™s 25 degrees,
according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. Hot weather
tends to boost power demand for air conditioning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
