The rand gained to a four-week high
against the dollar and headed for its best weekly performance
since December as evidence mounts the U.S. economy is slowing,
boosting demand for  South Africa ’s higher-yielding bonds.  The rand advanced as much as 0.9 percent to 6.6969 per
dollar, its strongest level since May 9. It traded 0.6 percent
up at 6.7264 at 4:54 p.m. in Johannesburg, bringing its gain
this week to 3 percent, the best performance for the period
among more than 20 emerging-market currencies monitored by
Bloomberg. It declined 0.2 percent to 9.7984 per euro.  The rand’s rally started on May 30 after South African
antitrust authorities approved Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s $2.4
billion purchase of a controlling stake in Massmart Holdings
Ltd. It extended its gains today after a Labor Department report
showed U.S. employers added fewer jobs in May, making it harder
for the  Federal Reserve  to tighten monetary policy.  “The Massmart deal did support sentiment, and we’ve seen
good foreign flows into the  bond market  because we have
relatively prudent policies in place,” Chris Becker, a
Johannesburg-based analyst at Econometrix Treasury Management,
which advises companies on currency transactions, said by phone.
“The rand is looking like a bit of a safe haven.”  Foreign investors were net buyers of 1.2 billion rand
($178.6 million) of South African bonds yesterday, according to
JSE Ltd. data, helping drive the yield on the benchmark 10-year
government bond to a five-month low. Foreigners have purchased
20.7 billion rand of South African bonds this year.  U.S. Jobs Data  The Labor Department reported today that payrolls expanded
by 54,000 workers in May, the fewest in eight months, after a
revised 232,000 gain the previous month that was the smaller
than initially projected. The median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for jobs growth to slow to 165,000.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six trading partners, fell as low as 73.99 after
the payrolls report, the lowest since May 6.  Investors bought South African bonds on speculation U.S.
rates will stay near zero for longer as the Federal Reserve
attempts to revive the  U.S. economy , boosting the relative
appeal of rand assets for investors who borrow in one currency
to invest the proceeds in higher-yielding assets. South Africa’s
benchmark central bank rate is 5.5 percent, compared with 0.25
percent in the U.S.  Bonds, Carry Return  “Dollars are being sold across most of the Group of 10
currencies and as such we can expect further rand strength,”
Brigid Taylor, a senior currency analyst at Rand Merchant Bank
in Johannesburg, said in an e-mailed response to questions by
Bloomberg. “Flat rates globally pose a positive for both the
currency and bonds locally.”  The rand returned 3 percent in the so-called dollar carry
trade this week, the best performance out of more than 20
emerging-market currencies monitored by Bloomberg.  The 6.75 percent government bonds due 2021 climbed 46 cents
to 90.26 rand, driving the yield down seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 8.21 percent, the lowest since Jan. 7.
The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 added 31 cents to 121.89 rand,
reducing the yield seven basis points to 7.41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
