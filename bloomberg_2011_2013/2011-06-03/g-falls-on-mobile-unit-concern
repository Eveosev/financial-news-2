LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s
third-largest maker of mobile phones, fell in Seoul trading
after its chief executive officer said a recovery at the handset
business may take longer than some analysts expected.  LG Electronics fell 2.3 percent to 92,000 won as of 12:33
p.m., headed for the lowest closing level since March 2009. The
stock dropped as much as 3.4 percent earlier in the trading
session.  South Korea ’s Kospi index gained 0.2 percent.  Koo Bon Joon, who took over as CEO in October, told
reporters yesterday that it will be difficult for the handset
unit to return to profit in the second quarter, according to
Sally Lee, a spokeswoman for the Seoul-based company. At least
four brokerages including Shinhan Financial Group Co. and Kiwoom
Securities Co. predicted in April and May that the mobile-phone
division would post a second-quarter profit.  LG’s mobile-phone division had an operating loss of 100.5
billion won ($93 million) in the first three months of the year,
contributing to a second straight quarterly loss for the
company. Sales and earnings will improve this quarter, helped by
new Optimus smartphones running  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software
and TVs featuring 3-D functions, Chief Financial Officer David Jung said April 27, after LG reported earnings.  Koo also said the TV unit is struggling because of high
inventory, according to Lee.  The company’s share in the global mobile-phone market
declined to 5.6 percent in the first quarter from 7.6 percent a
year earlier, Gartner Inc.  said  on May 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
