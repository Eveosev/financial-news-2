Sealed Air Corp. (SEE)  holder Davis
Selected Advisers, the company’s largest stockholder, said it
may oppose the packaging maker’s proposed acquisition of
Diversey Holdings Inc.  Davis Advisers “may have additional conversations with the
issuer and/or third parties regarding opportunities to maximize
the issuer’s value,” according to a regulatory filing today.
The  fund manager  holds 42.7 million Sealed Air shares, or 26.8
percent, according to the filing.  Sealed Air agreed June 1 to pay $2.9 billion for Diversey,
the cleaning-products maker owned by Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC
and descendants of Samuel Curtis Johnson. That represents a 52
percent premium for Sturtevant, Wisconsin-based Diversey,
according to Bloomberg data.  “We have been actively engaged in discussions with the
financial community about why we believe this transaction
represents an outstanding opportunity,” said Ken Aurichio, a
Sealed Air spokesman. “We look forward to continuing these
discussions.”  Sealed Air makes products including Bubble Wrap packaging
and Jiffy protective envelopes. The Elmwood Park, New Jersey-
based company is buying Diversey to expand into the cleaning and
sanitization markets.  Sealed Air dropped 51 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $21.89
today in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have fallen 15 percent since the acquisition was announced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
