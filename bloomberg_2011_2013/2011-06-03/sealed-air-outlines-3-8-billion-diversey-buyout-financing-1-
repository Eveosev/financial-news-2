Sealed Air Corp. (SEE) , the food-packaging
maker that’s buying Diversey Holdings Inc., outlined $3.8
billion of financing committed by Citigroup Inc. and its
affiliates to back the acquisition.  The financing package will include a $750 million five-year
term loan A, a $1.55 billion seven-year term loan B and a $1.5
billion one-year senior unsecured bridge loan, the Elmwood Park,
New Jersey-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  The cost to protect Sealed Air’s debt from default for five
years rose to the highest level since March 2009. Credit-default
swaps on the company’s debt added 26.6 basis points to 276.7
basis points as of 10:40 a.m. in  New York , according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Credit-default swaps, which typically fall as investor
confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates, pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  Sealed Air, the maker of Cryovac food packaging and Bubble
Wrap, agreed to pay Diversey shareholders $2.1 billion in cash
and 31.7 million shares of Sealed Air stock. The purchase also
includes $1.4 billion of net debt to be refinanced, for a total
cost of $4.3 billion.  A term loan B is sold mainly to non-bank lenders such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank loan mutual funds and
 hedge funds . A term loan A is sold mainly to banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
