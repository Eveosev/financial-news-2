(Corrects story published June 2 after Handelsblatt
corrected their original report.)  Google Inc. (GOOG)  has invested some 2
percent to 3 percent of its financial resources in wind parks
and solar energy plants, Handelsblatt reported, citing Urs
Hoelzle, head of engineering at the company.  The company, owner of the world’s most popular search
engine, has invested about $400 million in renewable energy
sources, with about 90 percent of this amount being a profit-
oriented investment, Hoelzle said.  The company has set up its own team of analysts to choose
the right projects, Hoelzle said. He didn’t give any exact
numbers, according to the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
