(Corrects date of incident in NRC report in first
paragraph.)  Citgo Petroleum Corp. had a unit
upset June 1 at its Lemont refinery in  Illinois , according to a
 filing  with the National Response Center.  “The unit was brought under control, which stopped the
leak,” according to the filing.  U.S. refineries must notify the center if they release
hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
