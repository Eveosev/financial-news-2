Asian currencies gained for a third
week on speculation regional central banks will keep raising
 interest rates  to stem inflation, boosting the yield advantage
on local assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
10 most-active currencies, climbed 0.2 percent for the week as
demand for the dollar waned after Moody’s Investors Service said
the U.S. risks losing its top credit  rating . The Thai baht had
the best week in more than a month after the central bank lifted
benchmark borrowing costs on June 1 to 3 percent, the fourth
increase this year. That compares with 1.25 percent in the
European Union and a maximum 0.25 percent in the U.S.  The Dollar Index dropped 0.8 percent this week to 74.373,
before a U.S. Labor Department report showed slowing job growth.
Malaysia’s ringgit climbed 0.7 percent to 3.0120 per dollar in
 Kuala Lumpur , Taiwan’s currency advanced 0.5 percent to
NT$28.750 and the baht rose 0.2 percent to 30.33.  “The Moody’s report changes the ballgame and shifts
investors’ focus from  Europe  to the U.S.,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a foreign-exchange strategist at CIMB Investment
Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The ringgit is holding firm because
of the knock-on effect from the dollar weakness.”  Moody’s said on June 2 America’s Aaa rating may be cut
should there be “no progress” on lifting the $14.3 trillion
debt limit along with efforts to cut the  budget deficit .  U.S. Jobs  Employers in the U.S. added a less-than-projected 54,000
jobs in May after a revised 232,000 gain in April, according to
Labor Department figures yesterday. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey was for payrolls to rise 165,000. The U.S.
jobless rate climbed to 9.1 percent in May.  A report from ADP Employer Services on June 1 showed
companies added 38,000 workers, less than the 175,000 predicted
in a separate Bloomberg survey.  The Bank of  Thailand  lifted its one-day bond repurchase
rate by a quarter of a percentage point this week after
inflation accelerated to a 32-month high of 4.19 percent in May.
Rates remain “low” and the pace of tightening is “still
appropriate,” Assistant Governor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan said
after the policy meeting.  “People in the market now predict more rate hikes than
previously expected, providing support to the baht,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a currency trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in
Bangkok.  Taiwan’s dollar climbed the most in the five days in more
than a month as exporters repatriated earnings. Overseas
investors bought $879 million more local stocks than they sold
this week, after net sales of $996 million last week, according
to exchange data.  Kept Selling  “Many exporters kept selling the  U.S. dollar  in the past
two weeks before potential further appreciation of the Taiwan
dollar,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader
at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank.  Elsewhere, South Korea’s won rose for a third week,
climbing 0.2 percent to 1,080.08 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  China ’s yuan advanced 0.19 percent to
6.4794, the Philippine peso climbed 0.4 percent to 43.213 and
Indonesia’s rupiah strengthened 0.5 percent to 8,531.  India ’s
rupee added 0.7 percent to 44.87.  To contact the reporter on this story:
