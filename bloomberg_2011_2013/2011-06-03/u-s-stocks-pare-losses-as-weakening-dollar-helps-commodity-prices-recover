U.S. stocks pared losses as a
weakening dollar helped commodity prices recover from earlier
declines triggered by weaker-than-forecast growth in jobs and
financial shares advanced.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index slipped 0.4 percent to
1,307.46 at 10:44 a.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 1.2
percent in early trading. The Dollar Index lost 0.4 percent to
74.024, while the S&P GSCI Index of raw materials was little
changed following an earlier 1.2 percent slump.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
