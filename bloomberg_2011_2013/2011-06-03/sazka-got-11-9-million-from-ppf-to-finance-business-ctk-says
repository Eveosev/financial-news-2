Sazka AS, the bankrupt Czech lottery
operator, already received 200 million koruna ($11.9 million)
from its main creditor PPF AS to fund its operations,  CTK 
reported, citing the administrator’s spokeswoman Lenka Ticha.  Sazka immediately paid its overdue fees to the Czech
Finance Ministry and plans to use the remaining funds for
winnings payments and staff wages to keep the lottery running,
the newswire added.  The creditors’ committee chose an offer from PPF to provide
loans worth up 500 million koruna to Sazka late yesterday. The
joint offer from Penta Investments and E-Invest, Sazka’s other
creditors, was rejected by the committee, CTK added.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
