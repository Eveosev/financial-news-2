Japanese stocks declined for a second
day as investors awaited a U.S. jobs report expected to show
hiring slowed in the world’s biggest economy and after Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan  survived a no-confidence vote, setting the
stage for a succession battle.  Nissan Motor Co., an automaker that gets about 80 percent
of its revenue overseas, fell 1 percent.  Nikon Corp. (7731)  lost 2.2
percent after Deutsche Bank AG cut the camera maker’s rating to
“hold.”  Inpex Corp. (1605)  sank 3.8 percent, leading declines among
oil producers after a Saudi Arabian official said OPEC is ready
to raise crude output to meet demand.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.
slumped 6.2 percent after saying contaminated water at its
crippled nuclear power plant may overflow from service trenches.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 0.7 percent to 9,492.21
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, after earlier advancing as much as
0.5 percent. Stocks swung between gains and losses ahead of a
U.S. Labor Department report forecast to show non-farm payrolls
grew in May at the slowest pace in four months. The jobs report
is due today in Washington.  “Investors are worried about the  U.S. economy  and how the
chaos in Japanese politics will affect the country’s rebuilding
process,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee the
equivalent of $18 billion as chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo.  Earthquake, Tsunami  The broader Topix fell 1.1 percent to 816.57, pushing the
gauge to a decline of 1 percent for the week. The index has
tumbled 12 percent since March 10, the day before the earthquake
and tsunami that devastated Japan’s northeast coast, leaving
almost 24,000 people dead or missing and disabling  Tokyo
Electric ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant.  Kan yesterday survived a no-confidence vote in parliament
by appeasing dissident members of his own party with an offer to
step down once the nation’s worst postwar crisis is contained.
The promise triggered a contest to select Japan’s next leader,
adding to the risk that reconstruction bills will be delayed.  Stocks retreated after the yen appreciated, cutting the
value of overseas earnings for Japan’s exporters. Nissan
declined 1 percent to 773 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , which gets most more
than 80 percent of its sales outside of Japan, fell 0.6 percent
to 3,860 yen  Yen Strengthens  Japan’s currency appreciated to as high as 80.65 against
the dollar today in Tokyo, compared with 80.89 when  stock
trading  opened. Against the Euro, the yen gained to 116.77 from
117.18.  Nikon slid 2.2 percent to 1,832 yen after Deutsche Bank cut
its investment rating to “hold” from “buy,” saying the
prospects for an earnings recovery in semiconductor equipment
are “unclear.”  Oil-related companies fell the most on the Topix. Inpex
sank 3.8 percent to 553,000 yen and  Japan Petroleum Exploration
Co. (1662) , the nation’s second-largest oil explorer, slid 3.7 percent
to 3,675 yen after Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi made comments
that could limit gains in crude prices.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is ready
to increase oil supplies if needed, Al-Naimi said ahead of a
meeting of leaders from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries next week in Vienna.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s biggest commodities trader,
dropped 1.4 percent to 1,988 yen after the London Metal Exchange
Index lost 2.2 percent yesterday, the biggest drop since May 23.
 Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (5711)  lost 2.1 percent to 238 yen.  Tokyo Electric slumped 6.2 percent to 286 yen. The utility
said the amount of contaminated water accumulated at its
stricken Fukushima plant increased to about 105 million liters
(28 million gallons).  Among stocks that advanced,  Kubota Corp. (6326)  gained 3.4 percent
to 727 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported the maker of  farm
equipment  may post operating profit of more than 100 billion yen
($1.2 billion) this fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
