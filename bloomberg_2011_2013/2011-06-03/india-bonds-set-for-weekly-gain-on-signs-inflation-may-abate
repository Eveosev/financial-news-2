India ’s 10-year bonds completed the
first weekly advance since April on speculation slowing economic
growth will help cool inflation.  Yields fell after data released this week showed gross
domestic product rose 7.8 percent in the three months ended
March 31 from a year earlier, the slowest pace in five quarters.
Investors were also probably attracted by the highest yields
since 2008, said Nirav Dalal, the Mumbai-based head of debt
capital markets at Yes Bank Ltd.  “Data this week suggested some slowing of growth, which
spurred debt buying,” he said.  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 fell 19
basis points, or 0.19 percentage point, this week to 8.27
percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate was little changed today. It
touched 8.46 percent last week, the highest level for a
benchmark 10-year bond since October 2008.  The  finance ministry  sold 120 billion rupees ($2.7 billion)
of debt maturing in 2016, 2022 and 2032 today.  India’s services expanded at the slowest pace in 20 months.
The Purchasing Managers’ Index  fell to 55 in May from 59.2 in
April, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in an e-
mailed statement today. A number above 50 indicates expansion.  The  Reserve Bank  of India last month increased borrowing
costs for the ninth time since mid-March 2010 and signaled it
was willing to risk a slowdown in economic growth to curb price
gains. Inflation eased to 8.66 percent in April from 9 percent
in March, and the central bank said the rate may stay
“elevated” until September.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell 29 basis points this week to 7.93 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
