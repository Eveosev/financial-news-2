Alastair Cook , Eoin Morgan and Matt
Prior surpassed 70 runs each as England overcame the loss of
three early wickets to finish on 342-6 at the end of first day
of the second cricket Test at Lord’s in London.  Cook fell four runs short of a century, while Morgan was
out on 79 as England’s batting steadied. At the end of the day,
Prior was unbeaten on 73, and Stuart Broad was not out on 17.  Cook’s fellow opening batsman, captainAndrew Strauss, was
out on 4 after 12 balls, while Jonathan Trott and Kevin
Pietersen were both dismissed for 2. Cook and  Ian Bell  had
combined for 108 runs before Bell was caught on 52.  Sri Lanka  won the toss, and elected to field. Suranga
Lakmal took three wickets and Chanaka Welegedara took two for
the visitors, who are looking to even the Test series after
losing by an innings and 14 runs in the first match in Cardiff.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
