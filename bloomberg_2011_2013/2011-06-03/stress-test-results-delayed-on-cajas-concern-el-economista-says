The European Banking Authority
delayed the publication of bank stress-test results because of
concerns about  Spain ’s savings banks,  El Economista  said, citing
unidentified people in the financial industry.  The EBA, which is conducting the stress tests, has
expressed its “amazement” to the Bank of Spain that all the
Spanish lenders in the tests would pass, the newspaper said.  Spain’s central bank has asked for public aid to savings
banks, or cajas, to be included in the stress-test calculations,
even though the money hasn’t been disbursed, El Economista said.
The EBA has doubts about the consequences of publishing numbers
that are too optimistic, the newspaper said.  A call and a voicemail left by Bloomberg News for Franca
Rosa Congiu, a spokeswoman for the EBA in  London , weren’t
immediately answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
