Indonesia ’s rupiah posted its biggest
weekly gain since April as international investors boosted
ownership of the nation’s debt after inflation slowed for a
fourth month in May. Benchmark bonds gained.  Consumer prices rose 5.98 percent from a year earlier after
having increased 6.16 percent in April, official data showed
June 1. Global funds boosted  holdings  of government debt by
almost 15 percent to 225.32 trillion rupiah ($26.4 billion) this
year, according to data from the debt-management office.  “Inflation is manageable and the economic outlook for the
country is positive,” said Wiling Bolung, head of treasury at
ANZ Panin Bank in Jakarta. “The market is still bullish on the
rupiah and investment in  government bonds  is still strong.”  The rupiah advanced 0.5 percent this week, the most since
the five-day period ended April 29, to 8,528 per dollar as of
3:45 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency gained 0.2 percent today from June 1. Financial
markets in Indonesia were closed yesterday for a public holiday.  Gross domestic product may rise more than 6.5 percent from
a year earlier this quarter because of an increase in foreign
direct investment, Rusman Heriawan, chairman of the central
statistics office, said on May 27. The economy grew 6.5 percent
in the three months through March.  Ten-year government bonds completed a fourth weekly rally.
The yield on the 8.25 percent securities due July 2021 dropped
three basis points this week to 7.37 percent, according to
closing prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. The
rate rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
