FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , South Africa’s
second-biggest financial-services company, ended talks about
acquiring a majority stake in  Nigeria ’s  Sterling Bank (STERLNBA)  Plc.  “The parties have been unable to agree mutually acceptable
terms,” Johannesburg-based FirstRand said in a stock exchange
filing today. The bank will “continue to evaluate options
regarding the company’s entry into Nigeria,” which offers
“strong underlying growth prospects” in the financial
industry, FirstRand said.  FirstRand said on April 14 that it was planning to acquire
a stake in Sterling Bank. The company has been considering
opportunities in Nigeria since 2009, when the country’s central
bank invited bids for healthy and distressed lenders after 10
banks failed an audit and asset prices fell.  Sterling Bank slumped by the maximum daily limit of 5
percent to 1.90 naira as of 1:45 p.m. in Lagos trading, heading
for the lowest close since Oct. 29. FirstRand fell 2 percent to
19.77 rand at 2:46 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Sam Moss, FirstRand’s head of  investor relations , didn’t
immediately return messages seeking comment left at the office
and on her mobile phone.  FirstRand, led by Chief Executive Officer Sizwe Nxasana,
said on Dec. 2 that it plans to enter Nigeria, Tanzania, Angola,
Ghana and Kenya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
