Owners of capesize vessels used to
haul  iron ore  and coal have cut sailing speeds by 20 percent
since September 2008 to prop up rates depressed by overcapacity,
shipbroker Lorentzen & Stemoco A.S. said.  A study of 90,000 voyages of bulk carriers able to carry
more than 80,000 deadweight tons found that average speeds
slowed to 10.4 knots from 13 knots, and added an extra two days
to each voyage, analyst Nicolai Hansteen wrote in a report e-
Mailed today.  “With fewer vessels being available for charter, the
market will be firming up faster due to increased demand for
tonnage,” Hansteen wrote.  One in five capesize vessels is unavailable for rent
because of decreased productivity, according to Lorentzen &
Stemoco, based in Oslo.  The global fleet of capesize vessels is just over 1,200,
including 108 new ships that began trading in 2011,
according to data from Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit
of Clarkson Plc, the world’s biggest shipbroker.  Hire costs for capesize ships have fallen 41 percent this
year to $11,773 a day, according to data from the  Baltic
Exchange  in  London . That’s $400 more than the operating cost for
a vessel, including crew and insurance and excluding fuel costs,
according to estimates provided by the London office of Moore
Stephens International, an accounting company.  The fleet has grown by 20 percent this year, outpacing
demand for dry bulk commodities shipments that are forecast to
rise 4 percent, Clarkson estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
