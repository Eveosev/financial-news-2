Sun Resorts Ltd., Mauritius’s second
largest leisure operator by market value, rose to its highest
level in almost two weeks after MCB Stockbrokers Ltd. raised its
recommendation to “hold” from “sell.”  The stock advanced 1 rupee, or 1.6 percent, to 64 rupees by
1:10 p.m in  Port Louis . A close at this level would be the
highest since May 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
