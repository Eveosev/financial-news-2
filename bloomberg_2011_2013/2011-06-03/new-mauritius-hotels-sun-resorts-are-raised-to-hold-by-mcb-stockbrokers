New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH)  and Sun
Resorts Ltd., Mauritius’s biggest leisure operators by market
value, were upgraded to “hold” rating from “sell” at MCB
Stockbrokers Ltd.  NMH, as the company is known, had its price estimate
increased to 105 rupees a share from 102 rupees, while Sun’s was
increased to 63 rupees from 62 rupees, Vanessa Lai Min, a Port
Louis-based research analyst with MCB, wrote in two separate
research notes e-mailed today.  “NMH appears to be outperforming peers in Mauritius but a
highly competitive low season and higher interest costs are
likely to drag earnings, although we should see an uplift in the
results of associates and from further villa sales,” Lai Min
wrote.  Tourism and textiles are the biggest sources of foreign
currency in the Indian Ocean island nation. Tourism revenue for
2011 is expected to rise 7.7 percent to 42.5 billion rupees
($1.5 billion), the  Central Statistics Office  said on February
25. The Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority is targeting
tourist arrivals to reach 1 million by the end of the year, from
934,827 in 2010.  Sun Resorts opened its 2.6 billion-rupee, 255-room  Long
Beach  resort in April. It plans to recoup the investment through
the Investment Hotel Scheme, a sale and lease-back plan approved
by the government that applies to 90 rooms and suites at Long
Beach.  The “expected profit on IHS will likely provide some
support to the share price,” Lai Min wrote.  NMH rallied 1 percent to 106 rupees, by the 1:30 p.m. close
in Port Louis, the highest since May 19, while Sun climbed 0.8
percent to 63.5 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
