Turkey  blocked the release of four to
five International Monetary Fund reports, Deputy Prime Minister
 Ali Babacan  said, according to Milliyet newspaper.  Babacan responded to claims by the main opposition
 Republican People’s Party  that the government had prevented the
publication, Milliyet reported, citing comments made to
reporters June 1. The IMF needs Turkey’s permission to publish
reports and the government didn’t allow the release because of
certain subjective analyses, Babacan said, according to the
newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
