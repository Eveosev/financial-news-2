Canadian mills processed 22 percent
less canola and 13 percent fewer soybeans in the week ended June
1, compared with a week earlier, an industry group said.  Mills crushed 90,830 metric tons of canola, also called
rapeseed, and 25,450 tons of soybeans, the Winnipeg, Manitoba-
based Canadian Oilseed Processors Association said today in an
e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
