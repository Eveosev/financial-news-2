Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators slipped for a second day as
meteorologists forecast cooler weather in the West that may
limit air-conditioner use.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments declined 8.8 percent to 17.7
million dekatherms (17.2 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in
 California  rose 0.5 percent after falling 3.7 percent yesterday.  Cooling demand in San Francisco and  Los Angeles  will be
less than 11 percent of normal until at least June 9, according
to Belton, Missouri-based forecaster Weather Derivatives. Power
plants use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies.  “Clouds and wet weather under a disturbance may inhibit
daytime heating and lower afternoon highs” over most of
California north of Los Angeles, MDA EarthSat Weather of
Gaithersburg, Maryland, said in a note to clients. The high in
 San Francisco  today may reach 63 degrees Fahrenheit (17
Celsius), 6 below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of State
College, Pennsylvania.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 22 percent to
22.3 million dekatherms after a 1.6 percent drop yesterday.  Wholesale gas at the SoCal Border hub, where gas is
delivered to the Southern California Gas Co., rose 2.85 cents,
or 0.63 percent, to $4.5844 per million British thermal units as
of 2:23 p.m. New York time on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
gained 8.34 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $4.7219 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
