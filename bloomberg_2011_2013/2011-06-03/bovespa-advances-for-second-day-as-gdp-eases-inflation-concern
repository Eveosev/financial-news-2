The Bovespa stock index advanced for
a second day after a report showed  Brazil ’s economy grew at a
slower pace in the first quarter, fueling bets that inflation
will subside.  Lojas Renner SA, Brazil’s biggest publicly traded clothing
retailer, led gains by companies that depend on domestic demand
as traders pared bets for higher borrowing costs. Tim
Participacoes SA advanced after regulators said they plan on
allowing telephone operators to enter the subscription
television market.  The Bovespa rose 0.7 percent to 64,680.86 at 1:40 p.m. New
York time. Fifty-two stocks gained on the index, while 15 fell.
The real rose 0.1 percent to 1.5740 per  U.S. dollar .  “The market is reacting to data that signals the economy
is still growing, but at a slower pace, which is good for
inflation,” said Dany Rappaport, who helps manage about 160
million reais ($102 million) at Investport in  Sao Paulo . “In
this scenario, companies that depend on domestic demand,
especially retailers and banks, tend to perform better.”  Brazil’s gross domestic product grew 4.2 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier, down from 5 percent in the
previous three months, the national statistics agency said in
 Rio de Janeiro . On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded 1.3
percent, up from 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both
figures were in line with the median estimate of economists in
Bloomberg surveys.  The quarterly result shows the economy is “still
overheated”, said  Zeina Latif , a senior economist with RBS
Securities Inc. in Sao Paulo.  In the interest-rate futures market, yields on most
contracts declined. Yields on the contract due in January 2013,
the most traded today in Sao Paulo, fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 12.47 percent.  Earlier Decline  The Bovespa index fell as much as 0.9 percent earlier after
a report showed U.S. payrolls increased by a less-than-projected
54,000 last month, after a revised 232,000 gain in April that
was smaller than initially estimated, Labor Department figures
showed today in  Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey called for payrolls to rise 165,000. The jobless
rate climbed to 9.1 percent from 9 percent a month earlier.  Lojas Renner jumped 4.7 percent to 61.80 reais. Tim climbed
2.6 percent to 7.86 reais.  Investors poured 1.79 billion reais into  Latin America ’s
biggest equity market in the month through May 25, after pulling
4.07 billion reais from February through April, data from the
Sao Paulo exchange show.  The Bovespa tumbled 12 percent through yesterday from a
November high on concern accelerating inflation will hurt
economic growth. The index trades at 10.3 times analysts’
earnings estimates, the lowest since March 2009, according to
weekly data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of
12.5 for the Shanghai Composite Index, 6.7 for  Russia ’s Micex
and 14.6 for  India ’s Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
