Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, hired  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ’s Nick Tansley as a
managing director in its global industrials group.  Tansley will be focused on the diversified industries
sector working with Philip Smith, Citigroup said in a memo to
its Europe,  Middle East  and Africa banking staff today. The
contents of the memo were confirmed by a Citigroup spokeswoman
in London. Tansley had been co-head of industrials at Nomura
since 2008.  Last week, the U.S. firm hired Jason Hutchings as head of
its metals, mining and energy mergers and acquisitions team for
Europe, Middle East and Africa from Nomura in London.  Citigroup, based in New York is rebuilding its investment
banking business after losing senior bankers, including Julian Mylchreest, the former co-head of energy, power and chemicals in
London. The firm hired Mark Hobbs from  UBS AG (UBSN)  to join its oil
and gas team in Houston and added banker Martin Lovegrove in
March from Standard Chartered Plc as chairman of its global
energy business. It also hired Pat Guerin from UBS in London in
March to advise clients on asset sales.  To contact the reporters on this story:
