Crude oil fell, capping the biggest
weekly decline in a month, as the U.S. jobless rate climbed to
the highest level this year, adding to concern that a slower
economic recovery will curb oil demand.  Oil dropped 0.2 percent after the Labor Department said
payrolls rose by 54,000 in May, the smallest gain in eight
months. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called
for a 165,000 increase. The  unemployment rate  advanced to 9.1
percent from 9 percent a month earlier.  “The economy is slowing down, so oil demand is going to
slow down,” said Carl Larry, director of energy derivatives and
research at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York. “That’s going
to be your main concern.”  Crude oil for July delivery fell 18 cents to settle at
$100.22 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
declined 0.4 percent this week, the biggest drop since the five
days ended May 6.  Brent crude  for July delivery rose 30 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $115.84 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  The European benchmark contract traded at a premium of
$15.62 a barrel to U.S. futures, up 48 cents from yesterday. The
difference between front-month contracts in  London  and New York
reached a record $19.54 on Feb. 21. The spread averaged 76 cents
last year.  Economic Outlook  Oil may fall in New York next week amid signals that jobs
growth and manufacturing in the U.S., the world’s biggest oil-
consuming country, are struggling to rebound, a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  Sixteen of 34 analysts, or 47 percent, forecast oil will
decline through June 10. Eight respondents, or 24 percent,
predicted prices will climb and 10 estimated little change.  “There is a lot of pessimism over the economy, and the
jobs report feeds into it,” said  Chris Barber , a senior analyst
at Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .  Factories in the U.S. cut payrolls in May for the first
time in seven months, a Labor Department report showed.
Employment at retailers, leisure and hospitality companies and
state and local governments also decreased during the month.  Jobs at factories declined by 5,000, compared with the
survey forecast of a 10,000 increase. Private hiring, which
excludes government agencies, rose 83,000 last month. It was
projected to climb to 170,000, the survey showed.  Slower Growth  U.S. economic growth slipped to a 1.8 percent annual pace
in the first three months of the year from 3.1 percent in the
prior quarter, revised figures from the Commerce Department
showed last week.  “The jobs report is really putting a damper on the
momentum,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst with PFGBest in  Chicago .
“Demand is obviously going to be weak, and supply has been at a
very high level.”  Crude oil inventories rose 2.88 million barrels to 373.8
million in the week ended May 27, the highest level since May
2009, the Energy Department said yesterday.  Supplies of gasoline increased for a fourth week, climbing
by 2.55 million barrels to 212.3 million, the department said.  Gasoline futures fell 2.54 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$2.9931 a gallon on the Nymex.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
respond at its June 8 conference in Vienna if the world needs
more crude, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi said
yesterday.  OPEC Production  OPEC will probably maintain production levels for an eighth
consecutive meeting, resisting calls to ease the pressure of
$100-a-barrel oil on the global economy, according to a survey
of analysts by Bloomberg News.  OPEC’s output rose 165,000 barrels, or 0.6 percent, to
average 28.895 million barrels a day in May, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of  oil companies , producers and analysts.
 Saudi Arabia  bolstered production by 75,000 barrels, or 0.8
percent, to 8.925 million barrels a day, the highest level since
October 2008.  Crude pared earlier losses as the dollar weakened to the
lowest level against the euro in almost a month after  Greece  was
approved for more assistance to address its debt crisis.  European Union and International Monetary Fund officials
agreed to pay the next installment to Greece under last year’s
110 billion-euro ($161 billion) bailout.  Euro Strengthens  The euro advanced 0.9 percent to $1.4618 as of 3:14 p.m. in
New York after climbing to $1.4643, the strongest level since
May 5. A decline in the U.S. currency makes dollar-priced assets
such as crude appear cheaper to investors using other
currencies.  “The weaker dollar does offer a little bit of support to
oil,” said Barber.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 640,248
contracts as of 3:14 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 785,925
yesterday, 17 percent above the average of the past three
months. Open interest was 1.52 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
