Spanish savings banks will be
required to repeat stress tests after the  European Banking
Authority  said this yearâ€™s round of  European Union  bank stress-
test results may be delayed until July,  El Confidencial 
reported.  The Bank of  Spain  will force Spanish savings banks to carry
out their stress test calculations again assuming greater
liabilities from real estate, which may mean some savings banks
will fail, El Confidencial reported, citing unidentified people
in the banking sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
