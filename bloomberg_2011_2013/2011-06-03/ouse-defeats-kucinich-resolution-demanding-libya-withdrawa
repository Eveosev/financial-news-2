The House defeated a resolution by
Representative Dennis Kucinich seeking to force an end to U.S.
military involvement in  Libya .  The Ohio Democratâ€™s resolution, defeated 265-148, would
have demanded a halt to U.S. support for the  North Atlantic
Treaty Organization  mission within 15 days.  Minutes earlier, the House voted 268-145 to pass an
alternative offered by Speaker  John Boehner  demanding that
President Barack Obama provide a fuller explanation of the U.S.
involvement in Libya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
