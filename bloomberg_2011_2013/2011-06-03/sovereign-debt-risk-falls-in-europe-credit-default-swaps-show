The cost of insuring sovereign debt
fell to the lowest in two weeks in  Europe , according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments dropped 5 basis points to 191. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on Ireland declined 14 basis points to 659,
Greece tumbled 65 to 1,384 and Portugal narrowed 9 to 680,
according to CMA. Spain fell 6 to 248,  Italy  decreased 3 to 155
and Belgium was 4 lower at 140.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers decreased 1 basis point to 158.5 and the
subordinated index was 2 lower at 261, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 40 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 1 basis point to 382,
and the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 investment-grade
companies fell 0.5 to 104.5 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
