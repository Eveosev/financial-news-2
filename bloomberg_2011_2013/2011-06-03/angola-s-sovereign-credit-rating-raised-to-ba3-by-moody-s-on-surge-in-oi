Angola’s sovereign debt rating was
raised to ‘Ba3’ by Moody’s Investor Service as surging  oil
prices  boosted the country’s fiscal and external accounts, the
ratings company said.  The southern African country’s assessment is three notches
below the company’s lowest investment-grade rating, and on par
with Egypt. The outlook on the rating is stable, Moody’s said in
an e-mailed statement today, implying it probably won’t change
soon.  Higher oil prices boosted state revenues, helping the
country swing from a fiscal deficit in 2009 to a surplus last
year, while gross domestic product growth is forecast at a
“robust” 7.6 percent for 2011, Moody’s said. Angola’s
dependence on oil revenues and high inflation rate remains a
constraint to the economy, the ratings agency said.  “Moody’s expects the balance sheet of the Angolan
government to improve substantially to the extent that the
country could become a net creditor within the next 12 months,”
it said. “This positive development should not mask the
challenges  Angola  is facing, such as high structural inflation,
the uncompetitive non-oil economy, weak governance and limited
human capital.”  Angola, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer
after Nigeria, has a $1.4 billion loan facility with the IMF.
The southern African nation intends to sell its debut dollar
bond of $500 million in September, Finance Minister Carlos
Alberto Lopes said on April 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
