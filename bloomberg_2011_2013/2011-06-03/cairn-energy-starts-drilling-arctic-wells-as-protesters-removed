Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  said it started
drilling on two wells off the coast of West Greenland after
environmental campaigners were removed from its rig.  Protesters were made to leave the Leiv Eiriksson rig, a
semi-submersible drilling vessel owned by Ocean Rig UDW Inc., by
the Greenland authorities, the company said yesterday. Cairn
also started legal proceedings in the Netherlands against
Greenpeace to halt any further disruption to its drilling.  “An update on the drilling operations will be provided in
due course,” Cairn said in a statement today.  The Edinburgh-based company plans to drill four wells
offshore Greenland at a cost of about $600 million. Greenpeace
activists, who had been hanging from the underside of Eiriksson
in an Arctic survival pod with enough food and water for 10
days, had “no impact on operations,” Cairn said last week.  Cairn shares fell 2 pence, or 0.5 percent, to 423.1 pence
in  London . The stock has fallen 4.5 percent this week, giving
the company a market value of 5.9 billion pounds ($9.6 billion).  “We need to kick the  oil companies  out of the Arctic,”
Greenpeace campaigner Ben Ayliffe said today in an e-mailed
statement, citing concerns about oil spills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
