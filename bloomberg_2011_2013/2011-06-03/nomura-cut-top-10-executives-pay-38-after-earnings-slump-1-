Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  cut pay for
Chief Executive Officer Kenichi Watanabe and top executives by
38 percent last year after  Japan ’s biggest brokerage posted a
profit drop, according to documents sent to shareholders.  The securities firm reduced total compensation for its top
10 executives to 899 million yen ($11 million) for the year
ended March 31, from 1.45 billion yen a year earlier, the
documents posted on Nomura’s website showed.  Watanabe and Chief Operating Officer Takumi Shibata oversaw
a 58 percent profit decline to 28.7 billion yen for the year.
The firm is yet to benefit from its 2008 purchase of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s Asian and European businesses, with
operations abroad posting four straight quarters of pretax
losses in the period.  “It’s inevitable that Nomura executives took a pay cut as
the profit they generated doesn’t justify additional
compensation costs,” said Katsunobu Komizo, chief executive
officer at  Executive Search Partners Co.  in  Tokyo .  The executive pay packages include salary, bonuses and
stock, according to the document. Keiko Sugai, a spokeswoman for
Tokyo-based Nomura, declined to give a breakdown of individual
pay or comment on the drop in compensation.  Shares of Nomura fell 37 percent in the 12 months to March
31 and are down about 72 percent since the company bought
bankrupt Lehman’s operations. They slid 1.7 percent to 399 yen
at the close in Tokyo today.  Blankfein Gets Paid  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  almost doubled compensation for
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein to $19
million for 2010 even as earnings dropped 38 percent and the
stock was little changed, according to the New York-based firm’s
proxy statement in April.  “Nomura’s profit level and compensation gap with peers
illustrate the bank is yet to become a global player,” Komizo
said.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) , Japan’s second-largest
brokerage, paid 14 top executives 537 million yen in the year to
March 31, according to a document posted on its website today.
It paid 16 executives 880 million yen a year earlier, the
company has previously said. That implies their average salary
dropped to 38.4 million yen from 55 million yen.  Daiwa had a loss of 37.3 billion yen for the year ended
March 31, compared with a profit of 43.4 billion yen a year
earlier. Its shares declined 3 percent to 329 yen today.  Nomura will hold a general  shareholders’ meeting  in Tokyo
on June 28, while Daiwa will hold its meeting on June 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
