Angola will probably reach its goal
of reducing the inflation rate to 12 percent by the end of the
year, even though state-worker wages will increase by as much as
40 percent, central bank Governor Jose de Lima Massano said.  The bank will use “various instruments” to control
inflation, including restricting money supply, Massano said in
an interview today in Luanda, the capital.  Inflation slowed to 14.6 percent in April from 14.8 percent
a month earlier, according to the country’s statistics agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
