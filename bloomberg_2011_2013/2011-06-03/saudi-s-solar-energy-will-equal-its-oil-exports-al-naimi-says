Saudi Arabia  plans to generate solar
electricity equaling the amount of its energy from crude
exports, Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi said.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, has the
potential by 2020 to produce enough solar power to meet more 
than four times global demand for electricity, al-Naimi said
yesterday in a speech in Krakow,  Poland , posted on the Saudi
Press Agency website.  Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf oil producers are
boosting power supplies to service growing economies and
populations. They are also looking for ways to use less of their
exportable oil and gas as fuel for power stations.  The Kingdom may need to burn as much as 3 million barrels
of oil a day by 2020 if it doesn’t improve efficiency. That’s up
from 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent now to generate power
facilities that are under development, Ziyad Al Shiha, the
executive director of  Saudi Aramco  Power Systems, told reporters
on May 15 at a conference in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.  Al-Naimi said that Saudi Aramco is planning to build the
Kingdom’s biggest solar energy plant that would produce 10
megawatts of power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
