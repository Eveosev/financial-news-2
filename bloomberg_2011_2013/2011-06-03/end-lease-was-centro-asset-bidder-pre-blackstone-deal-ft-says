A group led by  Lend Lease Group (LLC)  made
a A$4.96 billion ($5.3 billion) offer for the Australian assets
of  Centro Properties Group (CNP)  in February, the Financial Times
reported, prior to the mall operator’s agreement to sell its U.S.
assets to Blackstone Group LP.  The offer had financial backing from Government of
Singapore Investment Corp. and Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board, the newspaper said, citing two people familiar with the
situation.  Centro said on March 1 it had sold its U.S. malls to
Blackstone to pay off some debt and had agreed with its
creditors to swap its Australian shopping centers for its
remaining loans. Lend Lease bid for Centro assets in February
2008 and maintained interest even as co-bidders changed, Chief
Executive Officer Steve McCann said at the company’s investor
day briefing on May 25.  “Things evolved over time and our consortium of investors
changed but our interest never did and still hasn’t but they
announced in the middle of March they have sold the U.S.
business and they’re recapitalizing the Australian business,”
McCann said then. “We are unaware of any other process and I
struggle to see how we can be involved in a process we are
unaware of.”  Lend Lease spokeswoman Iwona Polski today reiterated the
company is unaware of any process other than what Centro
announced in March. GIC didn’t immediately respond to a request
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
