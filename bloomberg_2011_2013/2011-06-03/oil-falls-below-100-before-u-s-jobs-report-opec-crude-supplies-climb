will respond at its June 8 conference if the world needs more
crude, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi said yesterday.  The U.S. data “will have a negative effect on  market
sentiment  and thereby the appetite for riskier assets such as
oil,” said Thina Saltvedt, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB in
Oslo. “Higher fuel prices in the U.S. seem to have started to
bite on demand, and so we don’t expect a big upswing in demand
this summer.”  Crude for July delivery traded at $98.80 a barrel, down
$1.60, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 1:45 p.m. in London. It earlier rose as much as 47 cents.

consecutive meeting next week, resisting calls to ease the
pressure of $100-a-barrel oil on the global economy, according
to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg News.  “Speculation on what the future may hold” is the main
reason for the current oil price,  Saudi Arabia ’s Al-Naimi said
in Krakow,  Poland . “There is no such thing as a fair price.”  Oil fell in intraday trade yesterday after a U.S.
