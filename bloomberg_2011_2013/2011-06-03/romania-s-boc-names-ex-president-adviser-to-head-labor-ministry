Romanian Prime Minister Emil Boc
nominated a former presidential adviser to head the country’s
Labor Ministry, almost two months after a possible conflict of
interest forced the previous minister to resign.  Boc named Sebastian Lazaroiu, 41, to fill the vacant
position and sent his nomination to the president for approval,
the government said in a text message today.  Lazaroiu will replace Ioan Botis, who resigned in April
because of a possible conflict of interest over his wife’s work
at a non-profit organization that received European Union funds
through the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
