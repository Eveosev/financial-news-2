Deutsche Bahn AG,  Germany ’s national
rail company, won’t expand its network of long-distance buses
when legislation to increase competition in that market is
introduced,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing a company
spokesman.  The company had said hitherto that it planned to buy more
buses and invest in marketing with the aim of becoming market
leader; it’s changed its mind because of the likelihood of heavy
competition, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
