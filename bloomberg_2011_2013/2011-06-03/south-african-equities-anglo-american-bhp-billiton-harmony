The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
lost 302.12, or 1 percent, to 31,575.65 at the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg, extending its drop this week to 2.5 percent.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the diversified mining company
that makes up 9.9 percent of  South Africa ’s benchmark stock
index, fell to the lowest in more than a week, losing 4.21 rand,
or 1.3 percent, to 324.59 rand. Emerging-market stocks fell as
U.S. employers added a less-than-projected 54,000 jobs, the
fewest in eight months, taking the  unemployment rate  in the
biggest economy to 9.1 percent.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  , the world’s second-largest brewer
by volume, retreated 2.10 rand, or 0.9 percent, to 243.40 rand.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  , the world’s largest mining
company, dropped for a fourth day, losing 3.70 rand, or 1.4
percent, to 255 rand. The company may face the first strikes at
its Australian coal mines in a decade after workers voted in
favor of the right to take industrial action in support of
demands for improved working conditions.  Impala Platinum Ltd. (IMP SJ), the world’s second-largest
producer of the metal, retreated the most since May 9, falling
4.25 rand, or 2.3 percent, to 183.75 rand. Platinum slipped for
a third day, heading for the lowest close since May 30.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s biggest maker of motor
