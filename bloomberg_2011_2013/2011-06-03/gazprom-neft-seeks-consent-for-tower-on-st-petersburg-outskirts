OAO Gazprom Neft, oil arm of  Russia ’s
natural-gas exporter, won approval from government officials in
 St. Petersburg  to build a head office on the city’s outskirts as
tall as 500 meters (1,600 feet) as it relocates from Moscow.  A city panel on construction and architecture granted
approval for the skyscraper, according to an e-mailed statement
today from Okhta Center, the developer of the project. The
company was forced to change earlier plans to build a tower in
the historic center of the city after a public outcry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
