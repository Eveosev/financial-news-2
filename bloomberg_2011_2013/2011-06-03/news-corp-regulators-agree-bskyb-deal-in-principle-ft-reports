News Corp. (NWSA)  has reached an agreement
in principle with U.K. regulators on a plan to remove the final
hurdles to its bid for full control of  British Sky Broadcasting
Group Plc (BSY) , the Financial Times reported, citing people close to
the negotiations. Final merger clearance from the government may
not come until early July because of the possibility of further
procedural delays, the FT said, citing three people involved in
the discussions.  Ofcom spokesman Ed Taylor declined to comment when
contacted by telephone outside office hours yesterday. A message
left at News Corp.’s News International London offices wasn’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
