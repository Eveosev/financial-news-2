The following is a statement released
by e-mail today from the  International Monetary Fund  about the

he was accused of sexual assault in  New York .  Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn today informed the Executive Board of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of his intention to resign
as Managing Director with immediate effect. Mr. Strauss-Kahn
made the following statement in a formal letter of resignation
to the Board:  Ladies and Gentlemen of the Board:  It is with infinite sadness that I feel compelled today to
present to the Executive Board my resignation from my post of
Managing Director of the IMF.  I think at this time first of my wife -- whom I love more than
anything -- of my children, of my family, of my friends.  I think also of my colleagues at the Fund; together we have
accomplished such great things over the last three years and
more.  To all, I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible
firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me.  I want to protect this institution which I have served with
honor and devotion, and especially--especially--I want to devote
all my strength, all my time, and all my energy to proving my
innocence.  Dominique Strauss-Kahn   The Fund will communicate in the near future on the Executive
Board’s process of selecting a new Managing Director. Meanwhile,
Mr.  John Lipsky  remains Acting Managing Director.
