The Kenyan central bank’s purchases
of foreign exchange in the currency market are aimed at boosting
reserves and not an indication the bank wants the shilling to
weaken, Business Daily reported, citing the bank.  Kenya’s foreign exchange reserves totaled $3.9 billion on
May 13, equivalent to 3.8 months import cover, which is less
than the four months required by law, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing a central bank e-mailed response to
questions. In the past 10 days, the central bank purchased 25
million euros ($35.7 million) and mopped up 5.5 billion
shillings ($63.2 million) in the domestic market, it said.  “Unless the build-up is maintained on a continuous basis,
the reserves level will keep declining,” the newspaper quoted
the central bank as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
