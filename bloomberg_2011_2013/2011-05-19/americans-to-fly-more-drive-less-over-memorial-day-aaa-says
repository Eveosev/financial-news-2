The number of Americans taking to the
skies during the Memorial Day holiday weekend will jump to the
most since 2005, while the number of drivers slips for the first
time in three years as gasoline prices flirt with $4 a gallon.  Air travelers during the holiday will jump 12 percent to
2.93 million, while trips by auto will fall 100,000 to 30.9
million, according to a forecast by the  American Automobile
Association , the biggest U.S. motoring organization. About 88
percent of travelers will drive to their destination.  Overall, about 34.9 million people will travel 50 miles or
more from home during the three-day weekend culminating in the
May 30 holiday, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said. Thatâ€™s a 0.2
percent increase from 34.8 million during the 2010 holiday
period and the second rise since 2004.  Memorial Day marks the traditional beginning of the summer
travel season and the peak period for gasoline use. This year,
the holiday falls a day earlier than in 2010. Weekend holiday
travel tends to be more robust when the holiday falls later in
the month, AAA said.  Holiday airfares will be 14 percent higher than a year
earlier, with an average lowest round-trip rate of $201 for the
top 40 U.S. air routes.  The average distance traveled will be 792 miles, up from
626 miles in 2010. Median spending will fall 14 percent to $692
from $809 last year, AAA said.  Other modes of transportation, including rail, buses and
boats, will be used for about 3 percent of trips, AAA said.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 2.1
cents to $3.905 a gallon yesterday, up 37 percent from a year
earlier, AAA said on its website.  A survey of intended travels found that six out of 10 said
that higher prices at the pump would not affect their travel
plans.  The projections by AAA are based on research and forecasts
from IHS Global Insight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
