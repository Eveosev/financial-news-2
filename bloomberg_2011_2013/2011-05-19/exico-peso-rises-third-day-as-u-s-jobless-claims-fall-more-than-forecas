Mexico’s peso gained the most in two
weeks as jobless claims in the U.S., the nation’s largest
trading partner, fell more than economists forecast.  The peso rose 0.7 percent to 11.6295 per  U.S. dollar  at 5
p.m.  New York  time, from 11.7056 yesterday. The advance was the
biggest since May 6. The currency has advanced 6.1 percent
against the dollar this year, the best performer among the major
Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “There is a little bit of momentum for the peso now,”
said Aryam Vazquez, an economist with  Wells Fargo & Co . in New
York. “The structural fundamentals in Mexico are still sound.”  The number of Americans who applied for jobless claims fell
29,000 to 409,000 in the week ending May 14, below the median
estimate for a drop to 420,000 among analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, Labor Department figures showed. The number of
applications was the lowest in a month. The U.S. purchases about
80 percent of  Mexico ’s exports.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due 2024 fell 4
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.25 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.43 centavo to 123.61 centavos per peso.  The yield fell to the lowest since Jan. 4 yesterday.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. This month, traders
have exercised $242 million in options. The bank has been buying
as much as $600 million through the options monthly since March
2010, boosting foreign reserves and curbing the peso’s gain.  Economic growth slowed to 3.58 percent in March from a year
earlier, the lowest growth rate since January 2010, the national
statistics agency said today. The median forecast of 14
economists in a Bloomberg survey was for the economy to expand
4.3 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
