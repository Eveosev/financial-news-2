Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
said global regulators intend to release criteria for
identifying systemically important financial institutions in
July.  Regulators are working on the “methodology for identifying
these institutions, these handful of globally systemic
institutions,” Carney said during a conference at the
 International Monetary Fund  headquarters in  Washington  today.  Carney also said regulators may make changes to liquidity
standards that will be part of the Basel III global banking
framework.  The liquidity rules are being examined “for possible
systemic implications, and there would be potential adjustments
made,” Carney said. “Not to the underlying structure, but some
recalibration if that’s appropriate.”  Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, asked yesterday
whether Carney would be a suitable replacement for  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  at the IMF, said Carney is “doing a wonderful job
as governor of the Bank of Canada. I have great confidence in
him.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
