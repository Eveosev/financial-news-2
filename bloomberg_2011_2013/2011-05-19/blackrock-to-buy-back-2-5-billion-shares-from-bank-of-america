BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
money manager, agreed to buy back  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s
remaining stake for $2.5 billion and said it will retire the
stock.  BlackRock is repurchasing 13.6 million shares for $187.65 a
share, a 3.6 percent discount to the average closing price
during the 15 days prior to the transaction, it said today in a
statement from New York. The company plans to fund the
repurchase, scheduled to close on or around June 1, with
available cash and $2 billion in debt.  BlackRock said the transaction will add to earnings per
share immediately and won’t affect an ongoing 5.1 million-share
stock repurchase program. Bank of America, which acquired its
stake through the purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co. in 2009,
reduced its holding to 7.1 percent in November from 34 percent
when it and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. sold BlackRock
stock to other investors.  The transaction “removes uncertainty” around BlackRock’s
shares, Macrae Sykes, an analyst with Rye, New York-based
Gabelli & Co. wrote in a note to investors. “The marketing
agreement between Bank of America and BlackRock remains in
place.”  BlackRock rose $4.85, or 2.5 percent, to $198.10 at 4:15
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. It has gained
4 percent this year.  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of
America fell 10 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $11.69, bringing its
loss to 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
