Rwandan commercial banks’ assets grew
26 percent in the first quarter, the central bank said.  Total assets climbed to 751.1 billion Rwandan francs ($1.25
billion) in the three months through March, from 594.6 billion
francs in the same period a year earlier, the Kigali-based
 National Bank of Rwanda  said in an e-mailed statement.  Commercial banks also reported a 10 percent increase in
loans to 404.3 billion francs amid increased competition and
after the implementation of new banking regulations.  “All banks have strengthened their activities,” the central
bank said. “There is a strong growth in terms of assets, loans,
capital, deposit and profitability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
