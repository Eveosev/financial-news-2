Ukraine ’s economy grew 5 percent in
the first four months of the year after expanding 5.3 percent in
the first quarter, the central bank said.  Growth slowed in April after demand declined for Ukraine’s
exports, mainly steel and machine building, the Kiev-based
Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy said in a statement on its website
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
