Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K. oil and gas
explorer focused on Africa, rose after saying that production
from its Ebok project in  Nigeria  reached more than 17,000
barrels of oil a day, ahead of expectations.  Afren rose 5.5 percent to 156.6 pence in London. That was
the biggest gain since Oct. 21.  The explorer is producing about 40,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day, Chief Executive Officer Osman Shahenshah said
today in a statement. “The company will be drilling a number of
high impact wells across both West and East Africa, and together
with a strong acquisitions pipeline, Afren is very well
positioned as we move towards the second half of the year.”  Afren expects to triple revenue this year to more than $1
billion, Shahenshah said in March. The company forecast output
from Ebok to rise to 35,000 barrels a day by the end of the
second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
