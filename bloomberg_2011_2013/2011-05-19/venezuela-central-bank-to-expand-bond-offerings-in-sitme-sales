Venezuela  will expand its offering of
dollar-denominated bonds it sells in a bid to maintain the
average $30 million to $40 million it injects daily into the
central-bank administered foreign exchange market, bank director
 Armando Leon  said.  The Sitme, as the market is known, will begin this year to
sell Petroleo de Venezuela SA bonds maturing in 2022, Leon said
in an interview in his office in Caracas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
