Indonesia ’s rupiah gained for a
second day after a Federal Reserve report signaled  interest
rates  in the U.S. will remain low, maintaining the country’s
yield advantage over the world’s largest economy. Benchmark
bonds rose.  The currency traded near a seven-year high as the  Jakarta
Composite Index (JCI)  advanced for a second day. Overseas investors
increased holdings of Indonesian government debt by 1.5 percent
from the end of April to 224.69 trillion rupiah ($26.3 billion)
as of May 16, according to data from the  Debt Management Office .
Indonesia’s benchmark interest rate is 6.75 percent, compared
with a maximum of 0.25 percent in the U.S.  “Improved sentiment toward emerging-market assets is
supporting the rupiah,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst
at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “The Federal Reserve report
hints it will extend the low interest-rate policy.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.1 percent to 8,553 per dollar as
of 4:44 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency reached 8,522 on May 11 and 12, the strongest level
since March 2004. The rupiah has rallied 5 percent this year,
the second-best performance among the 10 most-traded Asian
currencies.  Ten-year  government bonds  gained for a second day. The
yield on the 8.25 percent note due in July 2021 fell nine basis
points to 7.47 percent, according to closing prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association.  The Fed’s key lending rate has not changed since December
2008. A report on the April 26-27 meeting, released last night,
revealed that interest-rate increases “would not necessarily
begin soon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
