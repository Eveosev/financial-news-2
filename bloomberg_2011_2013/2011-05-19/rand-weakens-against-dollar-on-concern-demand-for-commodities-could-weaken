The rand gained for a second day
after a U.S. government jobs report lifted confidence in the
world’s biggest economy. Bonds rallied, driving yields to four-
month lows, amid signs South African inflation is moderating.  The rand advanced 0.5 percent to 6.8882 per dollar at 3:40
p.m. in Johannesburg and 0.9 percent yesterday when South
African markets were closed for municipal elections. The rand
strengthened 0.6 percent to 9.8127 per euro.  Unemployment claims declined by 29,000 to 409,000 in the
week ended May 14, U.S. Labor Department figures showed. The
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey called
for a drop to 420,000. Declining firings and gains in hiring may
sustain  consumer spending , which accounts for about 70 percent
of the economy. Faster growth in the  U.S. economy  would support
demand for  South Africa ’s commodity exports and shares in the
nation’s mining companies.  “The jobless claims number was better than expected, and
that was equity-supportive for the moment,” Deon van Zyl, who
oversees about 13 billion rand ($1.9 billion) of debt as head of
fixed-interest investments at Cape Town-based Metropolitan Asset
Managers, said by phone. “That also supported the rand.”  The benchmark  stock index  climbed as much as 0.8 percent,
led by Anglo American Plc, a diversified miner that makes up 11
percent of the index.  Bonds Rally  Bonds surged after inflation accelerated less than
economists’ expectations in April. The  consumer price index  rose
4.2 percent, from 4.1 percent in March, the Pretoria-based
statistics office said on its website on May 17. The median
estimate of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for the rate
to increase to 4.4 percent.  “The better inflation numbers are still in a lot of
people’s minds,” Van Zyl said.  The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 climbed 61 cents to
89.45 rand, driving the yield down 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 8.34 percent, the lowest since Jan. 12. The
13.5 percent notes due 2015 rose 35 cents to 121.46 rand,
reducing the yield by nine basis points to 7.56 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
