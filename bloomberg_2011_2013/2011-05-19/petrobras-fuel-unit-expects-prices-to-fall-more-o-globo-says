Fuel prices will decline further as
lower sugar prices reduce the cost of ethanol, which is mixed
into gasoline, the  O Globo  newspaper reported, citing the head
of  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) â€™s fuel distribution unit.  Jose Lima de Andrade Neto, the head of BR Distribuidora,
said the new sugar harvest will increase the supply of ethanol.
BR Distribuidora lowered gasoline prices 6 percent and ethanol
prices 13 percent last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
