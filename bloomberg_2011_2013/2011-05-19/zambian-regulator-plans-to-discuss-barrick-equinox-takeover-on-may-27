Zambia’s Competition and Consumer
Protection Commission will meet on May 27 to discuss whether to
approve  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ’s takeover of the Lumwana copper mine
through its acquisition of  Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN) , an official at
the regulator said.  The official declined to be identified because the
information is yet to be made public.  The transaction is likely to be approved because Barrick
holds no other assets in the country and a decision will be
taken “soon” even though by law the commission can take 90
days to make a ruling, Brian Lingela, a spokesman for the
commission, said yesterday in an interview.  Lumwana accounts for 19 percent of Zambia’s copper
production, the commission said. Equinox has forecast that the
mine will produce 145,000 metric tons of copper this year.
In April Barrick bid C$7.32 billion ($7.55 billion) for Equinox
to gain control of Lumwana and Saudi Arabia’s biggest copper
deposit.  Barrick is the world’s biggest gold producer while  Zambia 
is the largest copper producer in Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
