Senator  John Barrasso , a Wyoming
Republican, led lawmakers from western states in introducing
legislation to boost production of oil on federal lands, a day
after Democrats blocked legislation to raise offshore output.  Barrasso’s  bill , which would require the Obama
administration to set production goals and speed the sale of
leases, was offered after gasoline prices increased 37 percent
in the past year.  “Higher energy costs continue to make it harder for
families across the country to make ends meet,” Barrasso said
today in a statement. “This legislation will help bring down
the cost of gas and give American energy producers the certainty
they need.”  While the Republican-led House of Representatives this
month passed legislation to open for drilling areas along the
Atlantic, Southern  California  and Alaska coasts, a similar bill
fell 18 votes short in the Senate yesterday. Democrats blocked
action, saying the measure ignored lessons from the 2010  BP Plc (BP) 
offshore oil spill.  Onshore federal lands may hold 31 billion barrels of oil
and 231 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and stretch over 279
million acres, roughly the size of Texas and California
combined, according to an  Interior Department  estimate.  Today’s bill, co-sponsored by Senators Mike Enzi of Wyoming
and  Mike Lee  from Utah, requires the Interior Department to hold
an oil shale lease sale within 180 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
