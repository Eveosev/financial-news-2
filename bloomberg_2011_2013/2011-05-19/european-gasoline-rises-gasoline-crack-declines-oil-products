Jet fuel barge premium traded close
to the highest in more than two months. Hess Corp.’s Hetco unit
sold a diesel cargo to Glencore International Plc. Gasoline in
northwest  Europe  advanced.  Light Products  Gasoline for immediate delivery traded at as much as $1,040
a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and the Platts
pricing window. That’s an increase of $18 a ton from the highest
deal yesterday on Eurobob grade fuel.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Cargill Inc. were among the
buyers on the so-called barge market, where lots of about 1,000
or 2,000 tons are traded.  Premium gasoline traded at as much as $1,045 a ton, the
survey showed.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, the European equivalent of heating oil, rose on
London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The contract for June delivery added $2.25, or 0.3 percent,
to $917 a ton on ICE as of 4:44 p.m. local time. Heating oil
barges were little changed, with deals done at discounts from $7
to the June contract, the survey showed.  Jet fuel, which trades at a differential to the front-month
gasoil contract, was little changed.  Vitol Group, which bought a 30,000-ton cargo two days ago,
was among today’s buyers as barge deals were done at a premium
of $91 to June gasoil futures. Yesterday’s premium of $92 on jet
fuel barges was the highest since March 7.  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group said it hedged 53 percent of its fuel
needs for this year and 49 percent for this quarter.  Europe’s largest carrier is hedged for this year at an
average price of $111 a barrel using  Brent crude , according to a
data posted on its  website . The Paris-based airline is covered
at $117 a barrel for this quarter, the data showed.  Jet fuel stockpiles fell to the lowest in more than two
years in Europe’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub
before the start of the peak summer travel season, according to
PJK International BV.  Supplies of the  aviation fuel  in independent storage
declined 37,000 metric tons, or 7 percent, to 491,000 tons, in
the week to today, the Oosterhout, Netherlands-based researcher
said. That’s the least since October 16, 2008.  Hetco sold 30,000 tons of diesel to Glencore at a premium
of $28 to the June gasoil contract, the survey showed. The cargo
is to be delivered to Amsterdam from May 29 to June 2, the
survey showed.  Diesel barges traded at premiums of $22 to $22.50 to the
June ICE gasoil contract, little changed on yesterday.  Russian exports of low-sulfur diesel from Primorsk on the
 Baltic Sea  are scheduled to decline in May compared with the
previous month, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Companies including OAO Lukoil and TNK-BP will ship about
452,000 tons this month to Europe, the plan showed. That
compares with about 500,000 tons in April and 520,000 tons in
the same month a year earlier.  Ultra-low sulfur diesel dropped 0.3 percent to $943.32 a
ton, according to Bloomberg data. That diesel contains no more
than 10 parts per million of sulfur.  Residues  Low-sulfur  fuel oil ’s premium to the high-sulfur grade
narrowed to $29 a ton from $33 yesterday, the survey showed.  High-sulfur fuel oil, used mainly in shipping, contains no
more than 3.5 percent sulfur. The low-sulfur grade, which has a
1 percent threshold, is used to power ships and generate
electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
