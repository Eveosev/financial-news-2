Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC) , the
Toronto-based oil producer that operates fields in  Colombia ,
fell to the lowest level in more than a week in Bogota after
heavy rains slowed production, contributing to a first-quarter
net loss of $69.6 million.  Production was “negatively impacted” by delays in the
expansion of the OCENSA pipeline and heavy rains that slowed oil
shipments by truck, the company said in a  statement  on its
website late yesterday. Non-operating items of $204 million also
contributed to the net loss, according to the statement.  The stock fell for a second day, dropping 1.4 percent to
49,200 pesos at 11:38 a.m. New York time, the lowest since May 9
on an intraday basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
