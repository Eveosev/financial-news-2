Foreign media reports that Vietnamese
authorities used violence to disperse a gathering of thousands
of Hmong ethnic minorities are “erroneous”, the state-run  Viet
Nam News Agency  said today.  The story published in the  news agency  known as VNA was
also posted on the  government’s website  today.  “In recent days, several foreign news agencies and media
organizations have continuously reported wrong news on what
happened during the so-called ‘unrest’ of the Hmong ethnic
group,” the report said.  Vietnam ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said a May 17 Human
Rights Watch  statement  calling for the government to conduct a
full and transparent investigation into what the organization
said was a “crackdown” on Hmong Christians is unreliable. The
ministry’s statement was sent to Bloomberg News yesterday in
response to a request for comment on the rights group’s call.  “The current situation at Muong Nhe is stable,” said
Ministry of  Foreign Affairs  spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga in the
statement. “Elements who caused disorder will be dealt with in
accordance with Vietnamese law.” Muong Nhe is a district in
Dien Bien province.  Vietnam arrested an unspecified number of individuals it
said were “extremists” who had called on ethnic minorities to
gather in early May to agitate for a Hmong kingdom, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga said on May 12.  The U.S. Embassy in Vietnam made enquiries with Vietnamese
government officials about reports of violence in Dien Bien
province where the unrest took place, an embassy spokesman said
May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
