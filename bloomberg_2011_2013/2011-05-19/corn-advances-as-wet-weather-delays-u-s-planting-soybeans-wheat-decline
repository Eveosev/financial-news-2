Corn and wheat futures fell on bets
that U.S. supplies may be adequate, indicating yesterday’s rally
was exaggerated. Soybeans were unchanged.  Yesterday, corn surged 4.1 percent and wheat soared 6.9
percent. The gains may have been overdone because the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said last week that corn supplies at
the end of this year will be bigger than expected, said  Dale Durchholz  of AgriVisor LLC.  Grain prices “are up at lofty levels,” Durchholz, a
senior market analyst, said from Bloomington,  Illinois . Food and
ethanol makers “are unwilling to chase the game up here,
especially coming after last week’s supply-and-demand report
from the USDA saying things are a little more comfortable,” he
said.  Corn futures for July delivery fell 1.5 cents, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $7.4825 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, ending a five-session rally. The price
has more than doubled in the past year on tightening global
supplies and increasing demand from grain-based fuel producers
and livestock farmers.  The USDA said on May 11 that unsold domestic supplies
before this year’s harvest may total 730 million bushels, up 8.1
percent from its April estimate. Inventories still headed for
the lowest since 1996.  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $8.12 a bushel. The price has climbed 73 percent in
the past year.  Soybean futures for July delivery closed at $13.795 a
bushel after gaining 2.9 percent yesterday. The oilseed has
climbed 47 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
