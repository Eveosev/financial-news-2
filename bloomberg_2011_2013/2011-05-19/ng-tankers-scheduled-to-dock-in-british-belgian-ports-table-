The following table is an overview of
liquefied natural gas tankers scheduled to arrive in the U.K.,
 Belgium  and northwest  Europe .  The snapshot uses AISLive data on Bloomberg and information
from port authorities, including spot and multiyear-contract
cargoes. It may not capture all ships. Tanker capacity is in
cubic meters of LNG, which is gas cooled to a liquid state.  The first two tables list ships arriving in U.K. and
Belgian ports, followed by a watch list of tankers recently
docked in Britain. The final table shows historical arrivals.  The U.K. is Europe’s largest and most-active gas market.
Interconnector (U.K.) Ltd. operates a two-way  pipeline  between
Zeebrugge, the location of Belgium’s only LNG terminal, and
Bacton in east  England .  To contact the reporters on this story:
