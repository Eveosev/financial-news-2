Saft Groupe SA (SAFT)  said it will oppose
 Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) ’s legal action aimed at dissolving the
joint venture they share which develops and makes hybrid battery
systems.  Johnson Controls began legal action in the Delaware
Chancery Court to dissolve the joint venture yesterday. Saft
will oppose the filing as “it sees no legitimate grounds for
the dissolution,” it said today in a statement. The French
company dropped as much as 17 percent in Paris today.  Johnson Controls and Saft formed the venture in 2006 and in
2008 opened a lithium-ion factory for hybrid vehicles. The two
partners fell out over the size and strategic direction of the
venture, Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls said in its statement
yesterday.  Saft, based in Bagnolet,  France , said it doesn’t want the
venture to target “markets where Saft is already strongly
positioned and enjoys a rapid development.”  Saft fell as much as 5.06 euros to 24.7 euros, its sharpest
fall since March 2008, and traded at 26.14 euros at 12:44 p.m.
local time, valuing the company at 656.8 million euros ($938
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
