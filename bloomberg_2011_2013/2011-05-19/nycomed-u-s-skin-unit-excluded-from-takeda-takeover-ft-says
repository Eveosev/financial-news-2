Nycomed’s U.S. dermatology unit will
be excluded from the company’s sale to Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
for about 9.6 billion euros ($13.7 billion) in cash, the
Financial Times said, citing people familiar with the matter.  Nycomed shareholders, which include  Nordic Capital  with a
41 percent stake, will also benefit from any ongoing U.S.
litigation against generic rivals challenging its patents, the
newspaper reported on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
