Singapore â€™s stockpiles of middle
distillates plunged 10 percent, dropping for a second
consecutive week, data from a unit of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of middle distillates, including gasoil
and kerosene, fell to 10.6 million barrels in the seven days to
May 18,  International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Stockpiles of residues, including fuel oil and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen, climbed 6.9 percent to 22.5
million barrels, reversing two weeks of declines. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline dropped 1.7
percent to 10.1 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
