U.S. stocks trimmed gains after
reports on home sales, leading indicators and manufacturing
trailed economists’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,343.07 at 10:03 a.m. in  New York  after rallying 0.5 percent in
earlier trading. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 35.42
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,595.60.  Earlier gains came after jobless claims fell more than
economists’ estimated.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
