The following is the text of
 Canada 's employment insurance report for March released
by Statistics Canada.  The number of people receiving regular Employment
Insurance (EI) benefits fell by 3.0% (-18,600) in March to
606,200, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. The number
receiving benefits was down in every province, with the
fastest declines occurring in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario
and British Columbia.  Third consecutive decline in number of claims  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. Claims provide an indication of the number of
people who could become beneficiaries.  In March, 226,600 initial and renewal claims were
received, down 4.4% (-10,400) from the previous month and
the largest of three consecutive declines. With this
decrease, the number of claims received is the lowest
since August 2008, just prior to the start of the labour
market downturn.  The fastest declines occurred in  Alberta  (-7.2%) and
Saskatchewan (-5.4%). In Ontario, the number of claims
decreased by 4.3% (-3,200) in March, offsetting the
increase in February.  At the same time, the number of claims rose by 2.4% in
 New Brunswick  and 2.0% in Manitoba. All other provinces
reported declines in March.  Number of beneficiaries down in every province  The number of regular beneficiaries declined in March.
The number has been on a downward trend in every province
for the past six months.  In March, the fastest monthly rate of decline in
beneficiaries occurred in Alberta, where it fell by 6.7% 
(-2,800) to 39,300. In Manitoba, it declined by 5.2% 
(-730) to 13,300, followed by Ontario (-4.9% or -9,300) 
and British Columbia (-4.6% or -3,300).  All other provinces had decreases ranging from 0.4% to
2.0%.  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  Employment Insurance data by sub-provincial region, sex
and age are not seasonally adjusted and are therefore
compared on a year-over-year basis.  Continued year-over-year declines in most large centres  Between March 2010 and March 2011, the number of
regular beneficiaries fell by 12.4% (-106,400) at the
national level, with decreases in 128 of the 143 large
centres (see map). Large centres are those with a
population of 10,000 or more.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of
beneficiaries declined in all five large centres. The
fastest rate of decrease occurred in Gander (-11.1%),
which registered a decrease in beneficiaries for the last
nine months on a year-over-year basis. In St. John's, it
fell by 9.5% to 5,500, the 12th consecutive month of year-
over-year declines.  In  Quebec , the number of regular beneficiaries fell in
31 of the 33 large centres between March 2010 and March
2011. The fastest declines occurred in Saint-Georges, La

In Toronto, the number fell by 18.6% (-19,200) to 83,800,
the 13th consecutive month of year-over-year declines. Of
the four large centers that had increases, the fastest

It was the seventh consecutive month of year-over-year
declines.  The number of beneficiaries decreased in seven of eight

The fastest declines were in Fort St. John, Quesnel and

province.  Demographic groups  Between March 2010 and March 2011, the number of male
regular beneficiaries fell by 13.3% (-75,600) to 492,600,
the 13th month of year-over-year declines.  Among men, the fastest rates of decline occurred for
those aged 25 to 54 (-15.5%) and 15 to 24 (-13.6%). Over
the same period, the number of beneficiaries fell 5.4%
among men aged 55 and over.  The rate of decline was slightly slower among female

this year-long period. This was the 10th consecutive month
of year-over-year declines.  For women, the number of beneficiaries decreased by
15.5% among those aged 24 and under, and by 12.1% among
those aged 25 to 54. The number of female beneficiaries
aged 55 and over decreased by 2.8%, the first decline for
women in this demographic group since November 2007.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  Each month,  Statistics Canada  provides analysis of the
current labour market situation, using Employment
Insurance (EI) statistics and other sources. Earlier this
month, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) provided a picture of
overall labour market conditions, including unemployment,
total employment and those affected by changes in the
labour market.  In this release, Statistics Canada provides additional
sub-provincial detail through the EI statistics. Details
by industry will follow with data from the Survey of
Employment, Payrolls and Hours.  EI statistics are produced from an administrative data
source from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada.
These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by
changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative
procedures. The number of regular beneficiaries and the
number of claims received for February 2011 and March 2011
are preliminary. In this release, large centres correspond
to those with a population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all persons
who received EI benefits from March 13 to 19. This period
coincides with the reference week of the LFS.  EI statistics indicate the number of people who
received EI benefits, and should not be confused with data
coming from the LFS, which provides information on the
total number of unemployed people.  There are always a certain proportion of unemployed
people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed
people have not contributed to the program because they
have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment
is not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed
to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria,
such as workers who left their job voluntarily or those
who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive
benefits.  The change in the number of regular EI beneficiaries
reflects various situations, including people becoming
beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.
