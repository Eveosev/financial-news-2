Total assets owned by Ugandan
commercial banks grew 29 percent in 2010 after they increased
their lending, the central bank said.  The combined value of assets by the 23 banks in the 12
months through December climbed to 11.30 trillion shillings
($4.7 billion) from 8.73 trillion a year earlier, Bank of Uganda
said today in a statement handed to reporters in the capital,
Kampala.  Lending by commercial banks last year expanded 35 percent
to 5.46 trillion shillings, while total profit by lenders grew
14 percent to 268.7 billion shillings, the central bank said.  The central bankâ€™s increase of the minimum capital
requirement to 25 billion shillings by March 2013 from 4 billion
shillings for existing banks will provide them with sufficient
funds for future growth, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
