Wind power profitability is not
certain at the price of 150 euros ($214) per megawatt proposed
by the French government,  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA Chief Executive Officer
Gerard Mestrallet said in an interview with daily  La Tribune .  The price has to be significantly changed for GDF Suez to
be able to respond positively to tenders, the CEO said in an
interview, according to the newspaper.  GDF Suez, Areva SA and Vinci SA, which plan to jointly
develop wind-power projects, donâ€™t rule out allowing other
European energy producers to invest in project companies, La
Tribune said, citing Mestrallet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
