The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:31 a.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.5 percent to 14,141.84, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.5 percent to 1,702.80.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  ,  Colombia ’s biggest oil company,
rose 0.8 percent to 3,890 pesos. Colombia will double oil
transport capacity to 1.4 million barrels a day in 2014 from
700,000 currently, and invest about $8 billion to boost refining
capacity by 85,000 barrels a day, President  Juan Manuel Santos 
said yesterday.  Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA CB), Colombia’s biggest food
producer and largest coffee roaster, dropped 1.8 percent to
23,200 pesos. Coffee rose the most in more than a week yesterday
on concern that rains will hurt crops in Colombia, the world’s
second-biggest grower of the arabica variety. Colombia said
farms in central coffee-growing provinces will have more
rainfall this week following storms and floods this year.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, fell to a two-
week low after heavy rains slowed production, contributing to a
first-quarter net loss of $69.6 million. The stock dropped 1.6
percent to 49,100 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
