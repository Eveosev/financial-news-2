Indian shares advanced for the first
time in four days, led by  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , as some
investors judged recent losses as excessive.  Reliance,  India ’s most valuable company and the biggest
component of the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive
Index, climbed 1.5 percent, rebounding from a three-month low.
 Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering company, advanced
the most in three months after reporting record profit.  The Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose 55.20, or 0.3 percent,
to 18,141.40 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. A 12 percent
slump in the benchmark index this year has dragged the average
value of its stocks to 14.5 times estimated profit, down from
21.5 times in March 2010, last year’s high. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index has a multiple of 11.2 times.  “Stock valuations at 14.5 times forward-year earnings look
pretty attractive given the outlook for stable earnings growth
in the medium term,” said Sethuram Iyer, chief investment
officer at Daiwa Asset Management (India) Pvt. “We expect
corporate earnings to grow 15-to-20 percent in the current
fiscal year.” He said he’s buying stocks of drugmakers and
software exporters.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange
added 0.1 percent to 5,438.1 and its May futures settled at
5,433.95. The BSE 200 Index was little changed at 2,240.36.  India’s inflation rate, which has remained above 8 percent
for 16 months, needs to be brought down to boost economic
growth,  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao told
reporters in the northeastern city of Agartala yesterday.
Subbarao will hold a press briefing after a board meeting today.  Reliance Climbs  Reliance, owner of the world’s largest refining complex,
advanced 1.5 percent to 915.5 rupees, paring this year’s loss to
13.5 percent. The shares sank 4.9 percent in the previous three
days and closed yesterday at the lowest level since Feb. 10.  Larsen & Toubro jumped 5.8 percent to 1,594.85 rupees,
reversing an earlier loss of as much as 2.2 percent. The shares
had the steepest climb since Feb. 14, and surged as much as 6.9
percent, the most intraday since May 2009. Net income rose 17
percent to a record 16.9 billion rupees ($376 million) in the
three months ended March 31. That beat the 15.2 billion-rupee
average of 17 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Despite the continuing threat of rising inflation and
hardening  interest rates , the growth story of a resilient Indian
economy remains encouraging,” Larsen said in the statement.
Competition and rising materials costs may put pressure on
operating profit, it said.  Ashok Leyland  Ashok Leyland Ltd. (AL)  surged 3.8 percent to 48.45 rupees. The
truckmaker reported a fourth-quarter profit of 2.98 billion
rupees, compared with 2.23 billion rupees a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated a profit of 2.53
billion rupees.  India’s food prices rose at the slowest pace since February
2009 as food production climbs toward a record, boosting
supplies. An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products advanced 7.47 percent in the week ended May 7 from a
year earlier, the commerce ministry said today. It gained 7.7 in
the previous week.  Kaushik Basu , chief economic adviser to India’s finance
ministry, said yesterday inflation was “unacceptably high” and
measures to curb price rises will aid long-term growth in  Asia ’s
third-largest economy.  Overseas investors sold a net 2.6 billion rupees ($57.7
million) of Indian stocks on May 18, increasing total outflows
from equities this year to 28.9 billion rupees, according to
data on the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of
India .  India’s economic expansion and corporate profits lured
foreign funds to buy a record $29.4 billion of local equities
last year and made the Sensex the best performer and most
expensive among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
