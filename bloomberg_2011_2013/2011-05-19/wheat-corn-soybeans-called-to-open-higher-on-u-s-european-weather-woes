What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures are called to open 10 cents to 15 cents a
bushel higher on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City
Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  as dry weather
in  Europe  and the southern U.S. Great Plains threatens to cut
yields, said Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global Commodity
Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette, Indiana.  -- Corn futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT as wet weather in the northern Great Plains and in the
eastern Midwest delay U.S. planting, Zuzolo said.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago as soggy fields slow the planting pace in the U.S.,
Zuzolo said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open little
changed, and soybean-meal futures may open up $1.50 to $2.50 per
2,000 pounds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
