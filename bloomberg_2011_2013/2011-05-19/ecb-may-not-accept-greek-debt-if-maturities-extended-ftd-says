The  European Central Bank  may no
longer accept Greek sovereign debt as collateral if loan
maturities are extended,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
citing unidentified European officials.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  told finance ministers
this week the bank would revoke a special arrangement from last
year under which Greek debt is accepted as collateral
independently from its  credit rating  if  Greece  is given more
time to repay its loans, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
