Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  Chief Executive
Officer James E. Rogers said the U.S. should be careful about
depending on  natural gas  for energy even as his company seeks to
expand its portfolio of the fossil fuel.  The historic volatility of natural gas, questions about
accessible reserves, and the possible environmental implications
of drilling all raise concerns, Rogers told reporters today
after a speech in  Washington .  “If shale gas turns out to be a mirage,” and the U.S. has
switched too much electricity production to gas-fueled power
plants, the country will need to import liquefied natural gas,
or LNG, he said. “Guess what the price of LNG is tied to? World
oil prices.”  Duke Energy of Charlotte,  North Carolina , is merging with
Raleigh, North Carolina-based Progress Energy Corp., a move that
would increase Duke’s natural gas holdings, Rogers said. Duke is
also building two natural-gas plants, Tom Williams,a company
spokesman, told reporters.  “We’re doing gas, we’re just not getting over-reliant,”
Williams said.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Energy
Department are conducting separate assessments of the impacts of
hydraulic fracturing, a technique used to extract natural gas
from the earth by injecting chemicals to crack rock formations
and allow trapped methane to escape. Environmental groups blame
the technique, known as fracking, for contaminating drinking-
water supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
