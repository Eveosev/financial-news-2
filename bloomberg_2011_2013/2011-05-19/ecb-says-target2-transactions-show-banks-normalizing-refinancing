The  European Central Bank  said the
value of Target2 payments last year suggests banks are
“progressively” normalizing their refinancing behavior.  “The contribution of the Eurosystem’s open market
operations to banks’ refinancing activities decreased over the
last few months of the year, indicating that banks had a higher
recourse to the money market to meet their short-term money
demand,” the Frankfurt-based central bank said in its Target
Annual Report published today.  While the number of payments processed by the Target2
system was stable, the value of payments increased 7.6 percent,
the ECB said. The Target2 system had a market share of 91
percent of the total value of payments in large-value euro
payment systems in 2010, according to the report.  “Target2 continues to be instrumental in promoting an
integrated euro-area money market, which is a prerequisite for
the effective conduct of the single monetary policy and
contributes to the integration of the euro financial markets,”
the ECB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
