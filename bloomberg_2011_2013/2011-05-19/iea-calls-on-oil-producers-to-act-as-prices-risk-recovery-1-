The  International Energy Agency  said
that oil producers need to increase supplies as prices are
threatening the global economic recovery.  Brent crude  rose to a 2 1/2-year high of $127.02 a barrel
on April 11 on the ICE Europe Futures exchange as armed conflict
in  Libya  halted exports from the holder of Africa’s largest
reserves. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
responsible for 40 percent of global supply, will meet on June 8
in Vienna to review production targets.  “There is a clear, urgent need for additional supplies on
a more competitive basis to be made available to refiners to
prevent a further tightening of the market,” the IEA’s
governing board said today in an e-mailed statement. “The rise
in  oil prices  since September is affecting the economic
recovery.”  The Paris-based agency, an adviser to 28 oil-consuming
nations, said that it is “prepared to consider using all tools
that are at the disposal of IEA member countries.”  The IEA said March 15 that member governments hold a
collective 1.6 billion barrels of emergency inventories that can
be used if supply is disrupted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
