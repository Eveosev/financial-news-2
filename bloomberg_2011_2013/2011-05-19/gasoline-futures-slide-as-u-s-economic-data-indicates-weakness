Gasoline fell, erasing an earlier
gain, as data on home sales, leading indicators and U.S.
manufacturing indicated economic weakness.  Futures dropped, after climbing as much as 1.7 percent, as
the index of U.S. leading indicators slipped in April after nine
months of increases. Manufacturing in the Philadelphia area grew
in May at the slowest pace in seven months. April existing home
sales declined. Pump prices decreased a sixth straight day.  “Fuel consumption, the economy, people are just worried
about a lot of things, and the market isn’t ready to press
forward,” said  Gordon Elliott , a risk management specialist at
FC Stone LLC in  St. Louis Park ,  Minnesota .  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 2.95 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $2.926 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices are down 16 percent since reaching $3.4648 on
April 29, the highest level since July 15, 2008.  June was 2.2 cents over July futures, down from yesterday’s
2.95-cent difference. The spread has narrowed 83 percent since
reaching a 12.59-cent premium on May 10, which was the largest
backwardation since August 2009.  Purchases of existing homes fell 0.8 percent to a 5.05
million annual pace last month, the National Association of
Realtors said today.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months decreased 0.3 percent after a revised 0.7
percent gain in March, the New York-based group said today.  Economic Index  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index fell to 3.9, the weakest reading since October, from 18.5
a month earlier. The region covers eastern  Pennsylvania ,
southern  New Jersey  and  Delaware .  Futures rose as high as $3.0048 a gallon earlier as
unemployment claims declined by 29,000 to 409,000 in the week
ended May 14, Labor Department figures showed.  Regular retail gasoline dropped 2.1 cents yesterday to
$3.905 a gallon, AAA said on its website. Prices have fallen 2
percent since May 4 when they reached $3.985, the highest level
since July 24, 2008.  “The bullish factor is definitely the jobless claims,
which gave the outlook for demand a little bit of a boost,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in
 Chicago . “The falling gasoline prices will give a boost to
Memorial Day travel.”  The peak gasoline demand period starts with the Memorial
Day holiday on May 30 and ends on Labor Day on Sept. 5.  Trips by auto for the holiday weekend will slip for the
first time in three years, dropping 100,000 to 30.9 million,
according to a forecast by the  American Automobile Association ,
the biggest U.S. motoring organization.  The Energy Department reported yesterday that gasoline
consumption last week, measured on a four-week average, fell 2.3
percent from a year earlier to 8.99 million barrels a day as the
U.S. approaches the summer driving season.  Heating oil for June delivery dropped 1.12 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $2.8947 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
