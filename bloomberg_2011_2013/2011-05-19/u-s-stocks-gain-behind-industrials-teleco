U.S. stocks rose as industrial and
telephone companies led a rebound from an earlier slump
triggered by lower-than-forecast data on home sales and
Philadelphia-area manufacturing.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index climbed 0.2 percent to
1,343.15 at 12:39 p.m. in  New York  after losing 0.3 percent
earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 39.85 points, or
0.3 percent, to 12,600.03.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
