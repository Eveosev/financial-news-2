U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  called for the  International Monetary Fund  to move
quickly to appoint a new leader following the resignation of
Dominique Strauss-Kahn.  “We want to see an open process that leads to a prompt
succession for the fund’s new managing director,” Geithner said
in a statement released in Washington today.  The U.S. Treasury Department chief also praised John Lipsky, the fund’s No. 2 official who is now the temporary
leader.  “As acting managing director, John Lipsky will provide
able and experienced leadership to the fund at this critical
time for the global economy,” Geithner said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
