Nigeria  sold 70 billion naira ($447
million) of bonds at a monthly debt auction, with demand on
four-year debt exceeding supply by the most since September, on
bets the central bank will keep rates on hold this month.  The West African country sold 35 billion naira each of
three- and four-year debt at a sale yesterday, the Abuja-based
 Debt Management Office  said in a  statement  on its website today.
The bid-to-cover ratio on the debt due April 2015 was 2.8 times,
the highest since September. The marginal rate, or yield, on the
bond fell to 12.23 percent compared with 13.1989 percent at last
month’s sale. Bids outstripped supply on the 10.5 percent bonds
due march 2014 2.9 times, the most since the debt was first
issued in March, while the yield fell to 11.039 percent from
12.149 percent in April.  The inflation rate of  Africa ’s top oil producer declined to
11.6 percent in April from 12.8 percent a month earlier, the
statistics agency said on May 16. Central bank Governor Lamido
Sanusi on March 22 raised the benchmark interest rate for a
second time this year, lifting it one percentage point to 7.5
percent to stabilize the naira and slow inflation, which the
bank aims to bring below 10 percent.  “A lower yield environment over the past few weeks has
probably helped as well as the expectation of flat  interest
rates  when the monetary policy committee meets on May 23 and
24,”  Samir Gadio , a London-based emerging-markets strategist
with Standard Bank Group Ltd., said by e-mail today.  Nigeria issues sovereign bonds on a monthly basis to
support the domestic  bond market , assist in monetary control and
fund government deficits.  To contact the reporters on this story:
