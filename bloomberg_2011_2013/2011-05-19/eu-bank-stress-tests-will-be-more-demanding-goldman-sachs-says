European Union regulators’ stress
tests on banks will be more demanding this year than a similar
exam in 2010 that said firms would need to raise 3.5 billion
euros ($5 billion),  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  analysts said.  European banks have raised 122 billion euros since last
year’s tests, London-based analysts including Jernej Omahen and
Jean-Francois Neuez said in a report to clients today. The
European Banking Authority’s tighter definition of capital in
the 2011 tests may reduce Spanish banks’ core Tier 1 capital by
23 billion euros, they said.  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , Portuguese and
Austrian banks may also be “negatively affected,” they said.  Ninety banks will be expected to maintain a core Tier 1
capital ratio of at least 5 percent under the stress-test
scenarios, according to the EBA, which is carrying out the
tests. This year’s exams will include a review of how lenders
would handle a 0.5 percent economic contraction in the euro area
in 2011 as well as a 15 percent drop in European equity markets.  The “harsher methodology” in the 2011 tests “stops short
of testing for extremes,” the analysts wrote. The “EBA will
test for sharp declines in sovereign bond values, but not for a
restructuring.”  A theoretical haircut of Greek government debt by 40
percent would mean eight banks would need to raise new capital,
the Goldman Sachs analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
