Wheat rose for a fourth day in
Chicago, the longest streak since January, as persistent dry
weather in the U.S. and  Europe  may curb production. Corn gained
for a sixth session, the lengthiest run since December.  Wheat in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter, is in the
worst condition in 15 years, government data show. Europe’s
crop, making up a fifth of world production, is under threat
from the driest growing conditions in at least 36 years. Soil
moisture is “critical” in the U.K.,  France  and  Germany , the
EU’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources unit said yesterday.  “Increasing production uncertainty in the Northern
Hemisphere may yet spark another summer price rally as we
experienced last season,” Luke Chandler, global head of
agricultural commodity research at Rabobank International, and
analysts Keith Flury and Erin FitzPatrick said in a report.  Wheat for July delivery climbed 14.5 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to $8.315 a bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices are up 13 percent this week and yesterday
jumped the most since March 17. The grain surged 77 percent in
the past year.  Forecasters predicted yesterday that the crop in France,
the European Union’s largest wheat grower, will drop 12 percent
on dry weather as output in second-ranking Germany slides 7.2
percent.  “The fundamentals are really favorable,” said Connor Noonan, an analyst at Castlestone Management in London.  Milling Wheat  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose 7 euros, or 2.9 percent, to 249 euros ($354.87) a
metric ton.  As of May 15, U.S. winter wheat was in the worst condition
since 1996, with 44 percent of fields rated poor or very poor by
the government. The  National Weather Service  estimates rainfall
in the past two months was less than half of normal in much of
Kansas, Oklahoma and  Texas , the biggest U.S. producers of winter
varieties.  Corn for July delivery gained 9 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$7.5875 a bushel, extending an 11 percent rally in the past five
sessions. The grain more than doubled in the past year.  About 63 percent of the U.S. corn crop, the world’s
biggest, was planted as of May 15, according to the Department
of Agriculture. That compares with 40 percent a week earlier and
87 percent a year ago. Sowing was delayed as excessive rain made
many fields too soggy for farm machinery. The planting pace was
75 percent for that time of year from 2006 to 2010, according to
the USDA.  Soybean planting was 22 percent complete as of May 15,
compared with 7 percent a week earlier, 37 percent a year
earlier and the five-year average of 31 percent. About 36
percent of the spring-wheat crop was seeded, compared with 22
percent a week earlier and an average of 76 percent for the past
five years.  Soybeans for July delivery rose 9 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$13.885 a bushel in  Chicago . The oilseed gained 48 percent in
the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
