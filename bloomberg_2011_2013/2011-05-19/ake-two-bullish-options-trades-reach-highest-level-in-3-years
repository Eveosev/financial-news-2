Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO) 
bullish options volume rose to the highest level since February
2008 after the release of the company’s “L.A. Noire” video
game and before its fourth-quarter earnings report.  More than 37,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands as of
3:30 p.m. in New York, 26 times the four-week full-day average,
after 10,000 June $20 calls and the same number of December $20
calls traded in a spread strategy, according to Frederic Ruffy,
a senior options strategist at WhatsTrading.com, a  New York- 
based provider of options-market analytics. Shares of Take-Two
rose 2.4 percent to $17.48 at 3:03 p.m. in New York.  “This investor could be using June calls to finance a
longer-term bullish view,” said Caitlin Duffy, an equity-
options analyst at Greenwich, Connecticut-based Interactive
Brokers Group Inc. She said the trade is a bet that the shares
won’t rise above $20 by June expiration, then go above that
level by December.  Take-Two, which is based in  New York , will report a loss of
40 cents a share on May 24, according to the average analyst
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The company this week released
its “L.A. Noire” video game. Its shares haven’t closed above
$20 since September 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
