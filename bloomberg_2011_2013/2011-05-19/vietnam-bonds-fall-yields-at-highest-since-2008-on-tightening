Vietnam ’s bonds dropped, pushing
yields to the highest level since November 2008, on speculation
the central bank will keep tightening monetary policy. The dong
gained.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam on May 17 lifted the repurchase
rate for the seven-day maturity to 15 percent from 14 percent,
according to an e-mail from the monetary regulator.  “Bond yields will probably keep going up with market
interest rates” said Dam Trung Kien, a Hanoi-based trader at
Bao Viet Fund Management Co., a unit of Vietnam’s biggest
insurer. “A higher repurchase rate will boost interest in the
 interbank market , pushing up funding costs for banks to buy
bonds.”  The yield on the two-year bonds rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 12.67 percent, the highest since Nov.
14, 2008, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The market is also waiting for inflation figures to come
out,” Kien said.  Inflation surged to a 28-month high of 17.51 percent in
April, stoked by fuel and electricity prices. The General
Statistics Office will release this month’s consumer price index
figure within the next week.  The dong strengthened 0.05 percent to 20,775 per dollar as
of 3:45 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,673 today,
unchanged from yesterday, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of that rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editor: Sandy Hendry  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
