Cotton futures fell for the first
time in a week after a report showed importers canceled more
sales from the U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  Orange juice 
gained.  U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed today that a net
total of about 30,500 bales of cotton sales for delivery before
July 31 were scrapped in the week ended May 12, the eighth
straight week that deals were canceled on a net basis. Prices
have tumbled 29 percent in New York from a record $2.197 a pound
on March 7 as demand eased in  China , the biggest consumer.  “There are demand problems,” said  Jack Scoville , a vice
president at Price Futures Group Inc. in Chicago. “We can’t
have canceled sales all the time and see any kind of tight
demand that would drive prices higher.”  Cotton for July delivery declined 4.21 cents, or 2.6
percent, to settle at $1.5565 at 2:30 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York . The price had increased 11 percent in the past four
sessions on supply concerns amid droughts in China and Texas,
the biggest U.S. grower, and flooding in areas around the
 Mississippi River .  In the week ended May 12,  China  canceled purchases of
44,000 bales from the U.S. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218
kilograms.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery gained 4.45 cents,
or 2.5 percent, to $1.8495 a pound in New York. The price has
gained 26 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
