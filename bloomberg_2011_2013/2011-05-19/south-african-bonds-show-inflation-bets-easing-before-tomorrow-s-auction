South Africa ’s bondholders are paring
bets on inflation to the lowest in more than a week after
consumer prices rose less than forecast before the government’s
sale of inflation-linked bonds tomorrow.  The Pretoria-based central bank will auction 600 million
rand ($87 million) of inflation-linked debt, called linkers,
maturing in 2022, 2028 and 2033 at its weekly auction, according
to Reserve Bank data on Bloomberg. The auction is at 11 a.m. in
 Pretoria , with the results announced about 30 minutes later, the
Reserve Bank said.  The yield difference, or breakeven rate, between two-year
inflation-linked bonds and similar maturity standard notes,
dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 5.64
percent, the lowest since May 10 at 3 p.m. in Johannesburg. The
2014 fixed-rate bond yield has dropped 16 basis points since a
government report May 17 showed consumer inflation rate rose to
4.2 percent in April, less than the 4.4 percent median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of 23 economists.  “The April CPI release was probably also a positive
surprise for the  Reserve Bank ,” Rand Merchant Bank analysts led
by Theuns de Wet in Sandton, South Africa, wrote in a research
note. “If rising inflation doesn’t materialize as quickly as we
expect,” it may result in “nominal bonds outperforming
inflation-linked bonds,” they added.  Rand Merchant Bank pushed back its forecast for inflation
surpassing the central bank’s upper target of 6 percent to the
first quarter next year, from the third quarter, the analysts
wrote.  The Reserve Bank predicted inflation will breach its target
range in the fourth quarter, peaking at 6.3 percent in the first
quarter of 2012, policy makers said May 12 after keeping their
benchmark interest rate at 5.5 percent.  Investors bid for five times the amount of debt offered at
the previous auction on May 13, the most since Aug. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
