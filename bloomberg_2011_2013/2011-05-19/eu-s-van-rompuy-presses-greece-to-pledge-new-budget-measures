European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said the Greek government should show a renewed
commitment within a week to tackling the budget deficit and
national debt, calling the goal achievable.  “The coming days and week are very important in order to
establish a program so that  Greece  is now back on track for 2011
and also for the upcoming years,” Van Rompuy told a conference
today in Brussels. “There is no alternative for this. It is
doable.”  Earlier this week,  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group
of euro-area finance ministers, said the Greek government must
“rapidly” sell state-owned companies in order to get control
of the national debt. Juncker also said that a “soft
restructuring,” which would include a voluntary extension of
the maturities of bonds held by private investors, is an option
after the Greek government takes extra steps to narrow the
 budget deficit .  Responding to a panel question about a possible Greek debt
restructuring, Van Rompuy said politicians must be careful when
commenting on such matters.  “Politicians and others with big responsibilities have to
think twice before they speak on such delicate matters,” Van
Rompuy said. “Money matters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
