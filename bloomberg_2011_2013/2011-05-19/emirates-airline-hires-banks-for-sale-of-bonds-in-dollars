Emirates, the world’s biggest airline
by international traffic, plans to sell dollar bonds after
meeting fixed-income investors in Asia, the Middle East and
Europe, according to three people with knowledge of the sale.  The Dubai-based airline hired  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Emirates
NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) ,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  as joint lead
managers for the sale, the people said, declining to be
identified because details of the transaction are private. The
investor meetings will start in Hong Kong on May 23 and end in
Zurich on May 30, the people said. Meetings will also be held in
Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, London and Geneva, they said.  Emirates delayed a bond sale after borrowing costs rose,
Chairman Sheikh Ahmed said May 10 as the government-controlled
carrier reported a 43 percent increase in profit to a record
$1.6 billion for the year ended March 31. The Middle East’s
biggest carrier is building the largest Airbus SAS A380
superjumbo fleet as it seeks to establish Dubai as an inter-
continental travel hub and win passengers from Air France-KLM
Group and Deutsche Lufthansa AG.  “Emirates can confirm the appointment of the joint lead
managers and our intention to go on a road show, with a view to
launching a bond if market conditions, including pricing, are
favourable,” the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Emirates paid a dividend of 2 billion dirhams ($555
million) to the Dubai government for the year, the most to date,
 Sheikh Ahmed  said. He said the company had a “nice cushion” of
16 billion dirhams in cash.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
