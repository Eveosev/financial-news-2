Former  Reserve Bank  of Australia
Governor Bernie Fraser said his successor Glenn Stevens’s salary
is appropriate and that government oversight may result in
compensation that is too low.  Treasurer  Wayne Swan  indicated last month the government
may consider removing the Reserve Bank’s control of its top
executives’ salaries, including Stevens’s package worth A$1.05
million ($1.12 million). Stevens’s base pay in 2010 was more
than what the heads of the  European Central Bank  and U.S.
Federal Reserve made combined.  The debate between the RBA and Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s government centers on the wages the RBA needs to pay
to keep officials in public service in a nation with the world’s
sixth-highest gross domestic product per capita. The average
compensation of chief executive officers of  Australia ’s four
biggest banks in the most recent fiscal year was A$11 million.  “The work load is solid and there’s a lot of responsibility,
you are making a decision that affects everyone in the country
so you don’t take those lightly and you think very carefully
about them,” Fraser, 70, said in a phone interview yesterday
from his home near Canberra. “You have to work hard and it’s
the level of responsibility that weighs on you.”  The bank’s board agreed to a A$234,000 pay rise for Stevens
during the height of the financial crisis in October 2008,
according to  correspondence  between the central bank and the
Treasurer’s office obtained by Bloomberg News under a Freedom of
Information Act request.  Pay ‘Pipeline’  “It may have been untimely,” said Fraser, who earned
between A$400,000 and A$409,999 in 1993, three years before his
term ended. “But in my experience, it may have been in the
pipeline for quite a long time.”  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  was paid 367,863 euros
($523,322) last year, 2 percent more than his 2009 salary,
according to the bank’s annual accounts published in March. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  earned $199,700, while  Bank of Japan 
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa’s salary, at 34.4 million yen
($420,846) for the year to March 31, fell 1.5 percent from a
year earlier.  Remuneration for  Japan ’s central bank governor has declined
10.8 percent over the past 10 years as the country grappled with
deflation.  Stevens’s salary trails that of Hong Kong Monetary
Authority Chief Executive  Norman Chan , who earned HK$7.5 million
($965,000), plus HK$868,000 in benefits last year, according to
the HKMA’s annual report.  Avoided Recession  Australia was one of the few economies to skirt the global
recession as Stevens cut the overnight cash rate target to a 50-
year low of 3 percent. As the economy rebounded, he raised rates
in seven quarter-percentage-point steps from October 2009 to
November last year to its current 4.75 percent, the highest in
the developed world.  “The rate is sufficient for a large part of the economy
and the  exchange rate  is working like an interest rate rise,”
Fraser said. “I wouldn’t see any need to be rushing in to a
rate increase this year.”  Fraser said the Australian dollar, which reached a record
$1.1012 on May 2, would remain at or a little above parity for
at least the next 18 months. Fraser served from 1989-1996 and
was immediately followed by Ian Macfarlane, who held the  post 
until Stevens took the position in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
