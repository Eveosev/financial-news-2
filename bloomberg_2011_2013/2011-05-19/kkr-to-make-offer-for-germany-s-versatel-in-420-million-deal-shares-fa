KKR & Co. plans to make a cash offer
for  Versatel AG (VTW)  in a deal giving the German phone and Internet
company’s stock a value of at least 295 million euros ($420
million). Versatel slumped the most in more than two years in
 Frankfurt  trading.  VictorianFibre Holding GmbH, a holding company controlled
by funds advised by KKR, will offer no less than 6.70 euros a
share. Controlling shareholders Apax Partners LLP, Cyrte
Investments BV and  United Internet AG (UTDI) , who together hold about
92 percent of Versatel, agreed to sell their shares at 5.50
euros a share, Versatel said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The majority shareholders have agreed on what seems a
comparably low valuation which is likely to reflect the absence
of a strong near-term interest from other potential bidders,”
said Hannes Wittig, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Versatel, which competes with  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , fell 15
percent to 6.80 euros at 9:43 p.m. in Frankfurt, after rising 19
percent yesterday. The stock has gained 38 percent this year,
valuing the company at 298 million euros.  United Internet slipped 0.3 percent to 13.53 euros.  Versatel, which is being advised by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch and Latham & Watkins, said the offer is expected to close
in the second half of 2011. The deal is subject to regulatory
approval in  Germany , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
