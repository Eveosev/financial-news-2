President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s
closest political aide was accused by a group that backs Iran’s
supreme leader of trying to establish contacts with the U.S. and
its intelligence services, the  Shargh  newspaper reported.  The latest accusations against Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, a
relative of Ahmadinejad, were made by Hossein Fadaei, head of
the  Society of Islamic Revolution Devotees , according to the
Tehran-based newspaper. A “current of deviation” now exists in
Iran that is aimed at controlling key posts in the economy and
changing anyone who refuses to submit to it, the privately owned
Shargh cited Fadaei as saying.  “Current of deviation” is the term coined in recent days
by Mashaei’s opponents to define an ideological movement that
they say he initiated and that is detrimental to the Islamic
establishment under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
top religious figure in  Iran  and the final arbiter on the
affairs of state.  Political figures loyal to the leadership system have
criticized Mashaei as being too liberal and having too much
influence over Ahmadinejad. Mashaei’s daughter is married to the
president’s son.  To contact the reporter on this story:
