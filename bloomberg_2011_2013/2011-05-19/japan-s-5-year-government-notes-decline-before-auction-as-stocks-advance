Japan ’s five-year notes declined,
sending their yields to a two-week high, after demand slumped at
an auction of the securities.  The country’s debt with a maturity of five years or less
has handed investors a 0.3 percent gain for the past year,
underperforming a 1.9 percent return for the broader market,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Twenty-year yields slid for the first time in four days after a
report showed gross domestic product shrank for a second
consecutive quarter.  “The auction result is a bit weak,” said  Tetsuya Miura ,
chief market analyst at Mizuho Securities Co., one of the 24
primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales. “There
are few investors who see value in five-year notes.”  The benchmark five-year yield rose one basis point to 0.445
percent as of 3:18 p.m. at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 0.5 percent security due
March 2016 lost 0.048 yen to 100.259 yen. The rate earlier
reached 0.455 percent, the highest since May 2.  Ten-year yields were unchanged at 1.15 percent, while bond
futures for June delivery retreated 0.07 to 140.57 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo . Twenty-year yields slid 1.5 basis points to 1.94
percent.  Today’s sale of five-year securities drew bids valued at
3.25 times the amount on offer, the least since December.  Japan’s economy shrank for a second quarter, dropping an
annualized 3.7 percent in the three months through March, the
Cabinet Office said today. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 1.9 percent drop.  To contact the reporters on this story:
