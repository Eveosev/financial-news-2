Jack Wilshere  was picked for
England’s squad for the European under-21 championships despite
opposition from Arsenal coach  Arsene Wenger .  The 19-year-old midfielder was selected after a dispute
between the under-21 national team coach Stuart Pearce and
Wenger. The Arsenal coach said today at a press conference that
he’d been notified of Pearce’s decision on the 23-man squad,
which will be named this afternoon.  “I hear he has been picked,” Wenger said. “We have to
accept and respect the choice even if we think it is the wrong
decision.”  The finals start in Denmark on June 11, with England facing
Spain the following day. Wenger wanted Wilshere to get time to
rest after the Premier League season, which finishes this
weekend.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
