Thailand ’s baht declined, reversing
earlier gains, as Asian stocks fell after  Japan  reported its
economy shrank more than economists forecast last quarter.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined after Japan reported
its gross domestic product fell by an annualized 3.7 percent in
the first quarter. The median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 1.9 percent drop. Thailand’s vehicle
production slid 48 percent in April from March as the disaster
in Japan prompted automakers to cut output, the Federation of
Thai Industries said today.  “The contraction in the Japanese economy is a bit scary in
terms of manufacturing,” said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of
capital markets research at Kasikornbank Pcl in Bangkok. “That
can send vibes to the automobile sector that there may be
problems with the supply side.”  The baht weakened 0.2 percent to 30.30 per dollar as of
4:48 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency gained as much as 0.2 percent earlier after
commodity prices rallied and the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled
 interest rates  will remain low.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015 fell
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.44 percent. The
onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive a floating payment, rose two basis points to 3.20
percent.
