Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , plans to boost pensions,
state salaries and other benefits after crude prices rose.  The government of the Caspian Sea state increased its
budget for the year 25 percent to 15.9 billion mantas ($20.1
billion), after raising its forecast for the average price of
oil in 2011 to $80 a barrel from $60, the  Finance Ministry  said
on its website today.  The ministry increased its estimate for budget revenue this
year 29 percent to 15.6 billion mantas, without saying how it
plans to cover the difference with spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
