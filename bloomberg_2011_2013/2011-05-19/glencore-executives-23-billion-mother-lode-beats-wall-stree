Glencore International Plc’s initial
public offering values the stakes of the company’s top six
executives at $23 billion, surpassing wealth generated by some
of Wall Street’s most storied firms.  In contrast to Glencore, a commodities trader based in
Baar, Switzerland, the eight senior executives at  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  held stakes worth a combined $1.26 billion at the
time of that firm’s IPO in 1999, while  Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s top
seven executives held $11.9 billion worth of stock after selling
shares worth $2.8 billion in their 2007 IPO, according to the
New York-based firms’ prospectuses.  Glencore sold 1.14 billion shares, or about 16.4 percent of
the company after the IPO, to the public and so-called
cornerstone investors including  Abu Dhabi ’s Aabar Investments
PJSC and  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  The company has an option to sell an
additional 116.9 million shares to meet demand.  Following is a table showing the stock held by Glencore’s
top six executives at the IPO price of 530 pence ($8.56) per
share. The shares were unchanged after the first day of trading
on the  London  Stock Exchange.  The amounts don’t include the 238.8 million shares sold in
the initial public offering by Penwith Limited, a Jersey-
incorporated charitable trust incorporated to aggregate the sale
of shares held by employees.
