Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) , which
planned to commence an exchange offer for  Dollar Thrifty
Automotive Group Inc. (DTG)  this week, is delaying the action until
next week, a spokesman said.  Hertz, which offered $72 a share for Dollar Thrifty on May
9, said at the time it expected to start the process this week.
There are no “barriers” to beginning the offer, and the delay
is “a small timing matter,”  Richard Broome, a Hertz
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
