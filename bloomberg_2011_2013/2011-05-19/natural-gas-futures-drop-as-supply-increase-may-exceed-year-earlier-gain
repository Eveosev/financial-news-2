Natural gas futures in  New York  fell
to the lowest price in almost six weeks after a government
report showed a U.S. inventory increase last week that was
bigger than a year earlier.  Gas stockpiles gained 92 billion cubic feet in the week
ended May 13 to 1.919 trillion cubic feet, the Energy Department
said today. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an
expected gain of 90 billion. Stockpile levels rose 78 billion
cubic feet a year earlier, department data show.  “We had a big increase and it did allow the deficit to the
year-ago level to catch up a little bit,” said Carl Neill, an
energy consultant at Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “I don’t
see a whole lot of downside as the summer heat is coming in.”  Natural gas for June delivery dropped 10.4 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $4.094 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement price since
April 8. Gas has declined 7.1 percent this year.  The settlement below $4.20 per million Btu may lead to
further declines,  Mike Fitzpatrick , a partner with the Kilduff
Group energy consulting company in New York, said in a note to
clients today. Futures settled at $4.198 yesterday.  Storage levels were down 11 percent from a year earlier,
narrowing from 12 percent in the previous week, department data
showed. Stockpiles were 1.8 percent below the five-year average
last week compared with 2 percent the previous week.  The five-year average change for the week is an increase of
91 billion cubic feet, department data showed. A survey of
Bloomberg users showed an increase of 91 billion.  Weather Outlook  The Midwest will be cooler than normal next week, while
temperatures in the South will be in a normal range, according
to  Matt Rogers , a forecaster with Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland . The mild weather may reduce air conditioning
use, crimping gas demand from power plants.  The high temperature in Atlanta on May 27 will be 80
degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius), 2 degrees below normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .
The high in  Chicago  may be 71, 4 below normal.  Power plants use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies
according to the Energy Department.  U.S. industrial production unexpectedly stalled in April,
the  Federal Reserve  reported May 17, sparking concern that gas
demand growth will slow. Output at factories, mines and
utilities was unchanged following a 0.7 percent gain in March.  Industrial consumers account for 28 percent of the nation’s
gas demand, according to Energy Department estimates.  Natural gas shipments to U.S.  power plants  were set to rise
for a fourth day on forecasts for hotter weather tomorrow in the
South.  A sample of scheduled gas shipments for U.S. electricity
generation rose 2.3 percent to 12.8 million dekatherms (12.5
billion cubic feet) from yesterday’s 12.5 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg as of 1:30 p.m. in New York.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
278,050 as of 2:55 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 306,000. Volume was 183,408 yesterday. Open interest was
947,767 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
945,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
