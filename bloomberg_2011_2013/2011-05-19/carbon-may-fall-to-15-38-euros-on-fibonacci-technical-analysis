European Union carbon permits may
fall as much as 7.3 percent from yesterday’s close after
approaching the bottom of a range traded since March 14,
according to  technical analysis  by FuturesTechs.  The contract for December delivery declined to 16.44 euros
($23.46) a metric ton yesterday, its lowest level since March
25, and closed at 16.59 euros a ton on  London ’s European Climate
Exchange. It was at 16.51 euros as of 1:18 p.m. today.  The close was above key support levels at about 16.50 euros
a ton, Clive Lambert, the founding director of research and
training company FuturesTechs, said from Billericay near London.
“If we were to breach the 16.29-euro level area, there’s scope
for a retracement to 15.38 euros,” he said. The two levels are
respectively the 38.2 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci-chart
retracements of a move up since Dec. 24.  Fibonacci charts are based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Carbon permits have been trading in a range from 16.22 euros to
17.76 euros since  Germany  announced a temporary closure of seven
old nuclear plants on March 15.  The nation’s government may decide June 6 on a possible
permanent closure of the plants, Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen said May 17. A shutdown would boost demand for carbon
allowances, needed to burn coal and natural gas.  In the meantime, carbon prices may fall further, said
Carine Hemery, a technical analyst in Paris for Orbeo, the
carbon venture of Rhodia SA and Societe Generale SA.  ‘Quite Bearish’  “For me it’s turning quite bearish” and prices may fall
to 16.33 euros a ton, a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement from a
gain since Feb. 21, Hemery said today by phone.  Carbon was today trading near a lower Bollinger band of
16.52 euros, Bloomberg data show. Bollinger bands, developed by
analyst  John Bollinger , are based on historical price swings.
The bands narrow and widen to reflect the size of those moves,
and represent possible support and resistance levels.  Carbon may have formed a so-called  “triple top”  during
the past two months, potentially signaling a reversal of the
rising trend, said Brett Genus, a broker at OTC Europe LLP in
London. The tops are March 16, April 4 and May 2.  Carbon prices will likely hold above 16.50 euros ahead of
the German decision on potential nuclear-plant closures, said
Clemens Tummeltshammer, an analyst for Bloomberg New Energy
Finance in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
