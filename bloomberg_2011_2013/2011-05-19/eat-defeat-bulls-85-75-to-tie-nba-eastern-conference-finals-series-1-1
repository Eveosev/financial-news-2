The  Miami Heat  beat the  Chicago  Bulls
85-75 to tie their National Basketball Association playoff
series at one game apiece.  The best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals moves to Miami
for two games after the teams split the openers at Chicago.  Miami defeated Chicago after losing all three regular-
season games against the Bulls. Chicago never lost more than two
games in a row on their way to a league-best 62 regular-season
wins.  Chicago is in the conference finals for the first time
since it won a sixth NBA title 13 years ago. Miami has reached
the third round of the postseason for the only time since it
claimed its sole NBA title in 2006.  The winner will play the  Dallas Mavericks  or the Oklahoma
City Thunder in the NBA Finals. The Mavericks opened the Western
Conference finals with a home win last night and will seek to
double that advantage at the American Airlines Center in Dallas
tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
