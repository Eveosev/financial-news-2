China , the world’s biggest cotton
importer, canceled orders for 44,000 bales from the U.S. in the
week ended May 12, expanding the number of contracts scrapped in
the past two months, government data show.  Additional cancellations last week included 4,400 by
Vietnam and 2,200 by  Bangladesh , the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said. A net total of about  30,500 bales  of sales for
delivery before July 31 were scrapped, the eighth straight week
that deals were canceled on a net basis.  Before today, cotton futures plunged 27 percent from a
record $2.197 a pound reached on March 7 as Chinese consumption
eased. In April, the country’s imports of the fiber plummeted 35
percent from a year earlier, customs data show. A bale of cotton
weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
