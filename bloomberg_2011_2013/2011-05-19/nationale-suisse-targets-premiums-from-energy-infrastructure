Nationale Suisse, which insures the
construction of the world’s longest rail tunnel, plans to boost
premium income by selling more protection to energy companies
and infrastructure projects.  The insurer aims to increase premiums from its specialty
lines unit, which also sells policies covering maritime freight
and art collections, to 700 million Swiss francs ($792 million)
in 2013 from 490 million francs last year, business head  Stefan
Zemp  said yesterday in an interview in Zurich.  “We were founded as a marine company and have over 100
years experience in the engineering business,” he said. “This
business will become even more important for the group.”  Earnings from engineering policies will boost premiums at
the unit to about 40 percent of the company’s total, said Zemp.
Nationale Suisse and Allianz SE provide personal injury and
property insurance for the 18.7 billion-franc project to drill
the 57-kilometer (35-mile) Gotthard tunnel through the Alps. The
tunnel, due for completion in 2017, will shorten the four-hour
train journey between Zurich and Milan by 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
