Absa Capital  said sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest economies will expand about 5 percent over the
next few years, retaining the region’s position as the world’s
fastest growing market behind emerging Asian nations.  The 12 biggest countries in the region may grow in the mid-
5 percent range, Jeff Gable, Absa Capital’s head of macro and
fixed income research, said in an e-mail today. Absa Capital is
a unit of  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , which is controlled by  Barclays Plc. (BARC)   South African  government spending  on infrastructure, such
as power, transport and airports, has been the main source of
business for Absa Capital, with the same pattern in the rest of
the continent, Absa Capital Chief Executive Officer Stephen van Coller told reporters in Johannesburg today.  Absa Capital has increased earnings by 37 percent over the
past five years while doubling its staff, Van Coller said. The
number of employees increased to more than 1,800 people working
in 13 countries on the African continent, Van Coller said.  “The good thing about that jobs growth is that we continue
to make and grow profits,” Van Coller said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
