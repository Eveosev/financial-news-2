The U.K.’s longest river, the Severn,
is open for private tidal power projects, the government said,
seven months after rejecting a project that could have supplied
as much as 5 percent of the nation’s power.  The government is “encouraging developers to come forward
with a range of proposals” Minister of State for Energy and
Climate Change Greg Barker told lawmakers in Parliament today.
The government on Oct. 18 said low carbon generation such as
nuclear and wind power represented a better deal for taxpayers
than a so-called tidal barrage across the Severn.  “The government concluded that there wasn’t a strong case
for public investment in a Severn tidal power scheme in the
immediate term,” Barker said. “This does not preclude a
privately financed scheme coming forward in the meantime and we
are actively talking to developers about their plans for various
tidal energy schemes in the Severn.”  The government had been examining  five options  for tidal
projects on the river, which it says has a 14-meter (46-foot)
tidal range, one of the biggest in the world. Three of the
proposals were for dam-like structures spanning the river called
barrages, and two were tidal lagoons, or barrages cordoning off
a portion of the river bank.  “The primary barrier to the previous proposal was the 34
billion-pound ($55 billion) cost of that, which in current
circumstances didn’t seem feasible,” Barker said.  The Severn runs 220 miles (354 kilometers) from central
 Wales  to the sea between Wales and southwest  England .  To contact the reporter on this story:
