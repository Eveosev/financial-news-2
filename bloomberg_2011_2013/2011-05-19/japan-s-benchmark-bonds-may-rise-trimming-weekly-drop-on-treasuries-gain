Japan ’s bonds gained the most in two
weeks as the central bank maintained monetary easing to help the
nation recover from recession following a record earthquake.  Ten-year yields dropped from the highest level in more than
a week after  Bank of Japan  policy makers meeting today kept
unchanged their 30-trillion yen ($367 billion) credit program
and a 10-trillion yen asset-purchase fund. Bonds also advanced
after the Yomiuri newspaper said Japan may double the sales tax
to 10 percent by 2015, without saying where it got the
information.  “There are still expectations in the market for further
easing, which is positive for Japanese  government bonds ,” said
RuiXue Xu, a strategist in  Tokyo  at RBS Securities Japan Ltd.,
one of the 24 primary dealers obliged to bid at the government’s
debt sales. “A higher  sales tax  is good for Japan’s finances.”  The 10-year yield dropped 2.5 basis points to 1.125 percent
as of 3:14 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.1 percent security due in
March 2021 climbed 0.220 yen to 99.778 yen. The decline in yield
was the most since May 6.  The yield reached 1.165 percent on May 18, the highest
since May 6. It has risen 1.5 basis points this week, the first
weekly advance since April 8.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery rallied 0.25 to
140.82 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  BOJ policy makers kept the key overnight rate at a range of
between zero and 0.1 percent, as forecast by all 14 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura dropped his call made
last month to expand asset purchases to provide more stimulus.  “It’s abundantly clear that even if Nishimura had proposed
additional easing, it would have been turned down,” said
 Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist in Tokyo at Okasan
Securities Co., another primary dealer. His inaction “has no
impact over the market.”  Japan’s economy shrank an annualized 3.7 percent in the
three months through March, the biggest contraction in two
years, the Cabinet Office said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
