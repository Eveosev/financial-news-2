The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development urged greater exchange-rate
flexibility in emerging markets and changes to fiscal policy in
developed economies to trim risks related to capital flows.  To minimize risks linked to large capital flows, reforms
are needed, “particularly in respect of fiscal policy and
exchange rates,” the Paris-based organization said today in a
report. “There may also be a role for some form of  capital
controls , if designed in a way that minimizes distortions in
long-term investments and ordinary business activities.”  The report comes as Group of 20 countries are looking for a
set of rules on when capital controls should be used as part of
an effort to manage the global economy and trim imbalances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
