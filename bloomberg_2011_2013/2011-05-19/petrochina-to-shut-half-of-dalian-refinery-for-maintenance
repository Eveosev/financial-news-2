PetroChina Co., the nation’s second-
largest refiner, will shut half the capacity of its largest
refining plant in northern  China ’s Dalian city for more than a
month for maintenance, a company official said.  The 410,000 barrel-a-day plant will close eight refining
units, including a 200,000,barrel-a-day crude distillation unit
and seven secondary units, for scheduled maintenance starting
tomorrow, said the official, who declined to be identified
because of company rules. The units will be shut for 38 days, he
said.  The units are scheduled for maintenance after operating for
three years. They were added in August 2008 to meet additional
fuel demand during the Beijing Olympics, according to the
official.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Jane, Ching Shen Lee, Ryan Woo  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
