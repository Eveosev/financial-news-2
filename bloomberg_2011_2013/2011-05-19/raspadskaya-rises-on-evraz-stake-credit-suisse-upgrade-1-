OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)  gained the most in
four months as Kommersant cited unidentified people familiar
with the talks as saying OAO Severstal may acquire Evraz Group
SA’s stake in the coal miner.  Raspadskaya’s shares advanced 6.6 percent to 168.07 rubles
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest gain since Jan.
11. Credit Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation on the
stock to “outperform” from “neutral.”  Severstal added 1.7 percent to 483.7 rubles. Evraz traded 2
percent higher at $32.56 by 4:15 p.m. in  London .  The price Severstal might pay wasn’t disclosed and the
steelmaker declined to comment, Kommersant said. Evraz owns 40
percent of Raspadskaya, according to the paper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
