Bio Energy Resources Ltd.  of  Malawi 
plans to build an $18 million plant to produce bio-fuels from
jatropha seeds, the  Daily Times  reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Lourie Webb.  The company plans to start trial output in the final
quarter of the year before commercial production starts in 2016,
the Blantyre-based newspaper said, citing Webb. Bio Energy has
signed up 30,000 farmers to grow jatropha around the southern
African nation, the Times said.  Seed harvested from  jatropha  trees yields oil that can be
used in the manufacture of biodiesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
