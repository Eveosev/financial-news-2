Rain in  Colombia ,  South America ’s
largest coal producer, may cut output of the fuel by as much as
29 percent in the first half of the year, an industry group
said.  Production may drop to a range of 28 million to 30 million
tons between January and June as rain boosts the risk of
landslides and forces mining companies to halt machinery,
National Federation of Coal Producers President Jaime Olivella
said yesterday in an interview. That’s down from 39.4 million
tons in the year-earlier period, government data show.  "It limits the workday," Olivella said at the group’s
Bogota headquarters. "It’s delaying exports of thermal coal."  Above-average rainfall triggered by the La Nina weather
pattern has triggered landslides and flooding this year across
Colombia, the world’s fourth-largest coal exporter. Rainfall is
expected to diminish after June, enabling producers to increase
output in the second half of the year, he said.  Annual production in 2011 will be little changed from last
year’s 74.4 million tons, Olivella said.  Rain has soaked the nation’s two largest coal-producing
provinces, Cesar and La Guajira, home to mines operated by
Glencore International AG’s Prodeco group, Drummond Corp. and a
venture owned by  Xstrata Plc (XTA) ,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Anglo
American Plc. (AAL)   About 95 percent of production in  Colombia  is thermal coal
used by power utilities. The nation also produces coal used for
steel production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
