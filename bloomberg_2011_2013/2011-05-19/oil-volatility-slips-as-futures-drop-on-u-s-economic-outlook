Oil options volatility slipped as
June futures fell in  New York  after the index of U.S. leading
indicators dropped for the first time in 10 months, a sign fuel
demand may weaken.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 33.4 percent as of 5 p.m. in New York,
down from 35.1 percent yesterday.  Crude for June delivery fell $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to
settle at $98.44 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices have risen 41 percent in the past year. June futures

more-active July contract dropped $1.63, or 1.6 percent, to
$98.93 a barrel.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were

2,419 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  June options expired May 17 on the exchange.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
