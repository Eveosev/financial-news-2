An insecticide-resistant bug that is
an “important” pest of rapeseed may be heading to the U.K.,
the country’s Home-Grown Cereals Authority said.  Some populations of peach-potato aphids in southern  France 
and northern Spain have developed “high levels of resistance”
to a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoid insecticides,
the HGCA said in a  report  on its website today, citing surveys
by  Syngenta AG (SYNN)  and  Bayer AG. (BAYN)   “With the current prevailing winds from the south, there
are fears that some of these aphids may make it on to British
soil,” the HGCA said. “The peach potato aphid is an important
 pest  of oilseed rape.”  The U.K. is the European Union’s fourth-largest rapeseed
grower, after France, Germany and Poland, according to the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg. November-
delivery rapeseed has climbed 7 percent in Paris this month on
speculation that dry conditions in  Europe  will cut production.  The aphids can spread viruses that affect rapeseed, the
HGCA said. Pest control measures usually rely on giving seeds a
dressing of neonicotinoid insecticide, the authority said.  “If resistance develops in U.K. populations, control will
be severely affected,” the HGCA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
