European Union carbon allowances for
2014 fell to their lowest since March 25 as the blocâ€™s Climate
Change Committee meets in Brussels to discuss rules that may
help determine the timing of supply in phase three.  The committee may vote in mid-June on a plan that may allow
sales late this year for the phase starting in 2013 and running
through 2020, the European Commission said yesterday. The body,
which includes member-state representatives, will debate the
plan at a meeting today.  EU permits for December 2014 fell 1.2 percent to 19.65
