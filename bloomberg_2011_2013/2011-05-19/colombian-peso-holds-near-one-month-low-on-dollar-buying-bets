Colombia ’s peso held near a one-month
low amid declines in oil, the nation’s biggest export, and
speculation the government is buying dollars on the spot market
as it seeks to stem the local currency’s rally.  The peso was up 0.1 percent at 1,816.10 per  U.S. dollar  at
12:22 p.m. New York time, from 1,817.20 yesterday. It touched
1,831.20 on May 17, its weakest level since April 19. The peso
has gained 3.3 percent in the last three months, the best
performance among six Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in April the
government would create an overseas fund with as much as $1.2
billion from dollars bought in the local  spot market  through the
end of 2011, and forgo repatriating funds from abroad for the
rest of the year. That comes on top of the central bank’s plans
to buy a minimum of $20 million daily until at least June 17.  “While the trend is for the peso to continue
strengthening, the noise of currency intervention has been
helping push declines in an external environment characterized
by  risk aversion ,” said Gustavo Sorzano, an analyst at Bogota-
based Helm Bank SA.  Oil, which accounts for about 40 percent of Colombia’s
exports, fell on concern fuel demand may weaken amid signs the
 U.S. economy  is struggling to recover. Reports today showed the
index of U.S. leading indicators dropped for the first time in
10 months in April and sales of existing U.S. homes declined.
The U.S. is Colombia’s biggest trading partner, buying about 40
percent of the Andean country’s exports.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.20 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s price fell
0.11 centavo to 114.124 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
