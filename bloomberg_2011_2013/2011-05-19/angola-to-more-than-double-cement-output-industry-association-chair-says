Angola plans to more than double
cement production by 2013 in order to be self-sufficient in the
building material, Industrial Association of Angola Chairman
Jose Severino said.  Angola plans to renovate old plants and build new ones in
different parts of the nation to raise output to as much as 7.5
million metric tons in two years, he said in an interview today
in the capital, Luanda. The country currently produces 3.5
million tons annually, or half of its needs, he said.  The southeast African nation, which is reconstructing its
infrastructure destroyed during the 27-year conflict that ended
in 2002, imports the balance mostly from  China .  “The quality of limestone and industrial processes” used
by producers of some imported material can lower costs, “but
without the desired quality,” Severino said of imported cement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
