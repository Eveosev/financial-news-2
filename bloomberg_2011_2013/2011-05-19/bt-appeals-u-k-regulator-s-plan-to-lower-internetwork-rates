BT Group Plc (BT/A) , Britain’s biggest phone
company, filed an appeal claiming U.K. market regulator Ofcom
isn’t moving fast enough to force  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and other
mobile-phone network operators to lower some fees.  Ofcom said in March it would lower mobile termination rates
-- the wholesale fees that operators charge to connect calls to
each others’ networks -- about 80 percent by March 2015. BT
wants it done two years earlier, according to a summary of the
case filed today in the  Competition Appeal Tribunal  in  London .  “While we support many aspects of Ofcom’s decision to
reduce mobile termination rates, we are disputing the length of
time Ofcom has allowed for the benefit to find its way to paying
customers,” BT spokesman Michael Jarvis said in an e-mail.  U.K. operators gained about 3.5 billion pounds ($5.7
billion) in total revenue from termination rates in 2008,
according to Ofcom research last year. The London-based watchdog
said  mobile operators  are increasingly relying on Internet data
services to attract customers and boost sales.  Vodafone and the Everything Everywhere joint venture of
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and  France Telecom SA (FTE) , the U.K.’s biggest
mobile-phone network, also filed appeals with the tribunal,
claiming Ofcom had miscalculated the fee changes.  A Vodafone spokesman confirmed the appeal and declined to
comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
