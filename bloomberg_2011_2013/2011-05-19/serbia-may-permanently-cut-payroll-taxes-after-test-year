Serbia may permanently cut payroll
taxes by as much as a third if a current, yearlong reduction
yields positive results, Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said.  The recently introduced temporary measures to encourage
employers to hire workers and register them expires in May 2012
and “can serve as an introduction to a thorough revision” that
would lower several rates, now amounting to 60 percent of net
wages, to a bit more than 40 percent, Ciric said today at a
business forum in Belgrade.  “We need to see first the effects of the existing
measures,” Ciric said, referring to the government’s offer to
employers to cover pension fund contributions for new hires,
along with changes to payroll taxes for some age groups.  Serbia, a Balkan nation of 7.5 million people, is
struggling to emerge from its worst contraction in a decade,
with unemployment soaring to 20 percent and the economy
shrinking by more than 3 percent in 2009.  Serbia adopted fiscal responsibility rules in 2010, capping
the public debt-to-gross domestic product ratio at 45 percent of
GDP, while the fiscal gap should be cut to 1 percent of GDP in
the medium term to ensure stability.  If the net effect of the current measures turns out
positive on the budget with expected regularization of thousands
now working in the grey economy, the state will be able to
permanently cut the rates to “under 50 percent, actually closer
to 40 percent,” without having to raise other taxes, Ciric
said.  Serbia also has to keep its 2011 fiscal gap below 4.1
percent of GDP and trim it to 3.2 percent next year, as agreed
with the  International Monetary Fund , whose delegation is
currently in Belgrade discussing a new, precautionary
arrangement with the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
