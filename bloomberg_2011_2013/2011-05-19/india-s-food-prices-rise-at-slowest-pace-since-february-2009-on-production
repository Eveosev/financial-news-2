slowest pace since February 2009 as food production climbs
toward a record, boosting supplies.  An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products advanced 7.47 percent in the week ended May 7 from a

corn is estimated to climb 8 percent to a record 235.88 million
metric tons in the year ending June after a normal monsoon last

supply glut in food grains lowers prices,” said N.R. Bhanumurthy, a New Delhi-based economist with the National
Institute of Public Finance and Policy.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index rose 0.1
percent at 11:45 a.m., while the yield on the 7.8 percent note

in April from a year earlier. Prices advanced a revised 9.02
percent the month before, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Kaushik Basu , chief economic adviser to India’s finance
ministry, said yesterday inflation was “unacceptably high” and
measures to curb price rises will aid long-term growth in  Asia ’s
third-largest economy.  Rate Increase  The  Reserve Bank  of India boosted benchmark  interest rates 
by half a percentage point on May 3 after saying inflation will
remain at an “elevated level” until at least September. The
