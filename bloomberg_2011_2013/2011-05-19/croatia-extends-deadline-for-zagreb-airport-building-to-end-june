Croatia extended a deadline until the
end of June for 10 companies bidding for a contract to build a
new terminal at the international airport in Zagreb and lease
the facilities for 30 years.  The government was expected to announce the short-listed
companies today. The deadline was extended to “give the bidders
a chance to submit more detailed offers,” the  Ministry for
Transportation  said today in an e-mailed statement.  The ministry reiterated the winner will be selected in
September. The contract would take effect in the second quarter
of next year.  The winner will have the right to operate the existing
terminal while a new facility is built. There is a three-year
deadline for building the new terminal.  The first phase of work, during which a new terminal and
runways will be built, is estimated at 192 million euros ($275
million). After traffic through the airport exceeds 5 million
travelers, compared with 2.1 million in 2010, another 29 million
euros will be invested.  To contact the reporter on this story:
