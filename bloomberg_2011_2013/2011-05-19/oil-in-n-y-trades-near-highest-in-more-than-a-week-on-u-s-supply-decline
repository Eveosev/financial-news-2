Oil traded near the highest in more
than a week in  New York  after U.S. government reports showed an
unexpected drop in crude inventories and a bigger-than-forecast
decline in applications for unemployment benefits.  Futures were near $100 a barrel after as much as 0.7
percent. Stockpiles slipped 15,000 barrels last week to 370.3
million, the Energy Department said yesterday. Supplies were
projected to rise 1.7 million barrels in a Bloomberg News
survey. Jobless claims fell to their lowest in a month, a Labor
Department report today showed. The U.S. imposed sanctions on
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and six other officials as his
regime intensified a two-month crackdown on protesters.  “There is less risk aversion,” said  Hannes Loacker , an
analyst with Raiffeisen Bank AG in Vienna. “Downward potential
is really limited because we still have these tensions in the
Middle East-North Africa region and healthy demand growth from
emerging markets.”  Crude for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
rose as much as 69 cents to $100.79 a barrel and was at $100.24
at 1:34 p.m. London time. It advanced $3.19 to $100.10
yesterday, the highest settlement since May 10. The more-
actively traded July futures rose 18 cents to $100.74. Month-
ahead prices are up 43 percent in the past year.  Brent crude  for July settlement was at $112.52 a barrel, up
22 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Yesterday the contract increased $2.31, or 2.1 percent, to
$112.30, the highest since May 13.  IEA Production Call  The International Energy Agency said today that oil
producers need to increase supplies as prices are threatening
the global economic recovery.  “There is a clear, urgent need for additional supplies on
a more competitive basis to be made available to refiners to
prevent a further tightening of the market,” the IEA’s
governing board said today in an e-mailed statement. “The rise
in  oil prices  since September is affecting the economic
recovery.”  Jobless claims in the U.S. declined by 29,000 to 409,000 in
the week ended May 14, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey called for a drop to 420,000.  Imports of crude dropped 4.4 percent to 8.57 million
barrels a day, the Energy Department reported yesterday.
Refineries operated at 83.2 percent of capacity, the most since
the week ended April 1. Fuel imports declined 14 percent to 2.26
million barrels a day, the lowest since the week ended March 11.  Supplies of oil at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for the New York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade, fell 1.59
million barrels to 40 million. TransCanada Corp.’s 591,000
barrel-a-day Keystone pipeline was shut from May 7 until May 13
after a leak in  North Dakota . It runs from Alberta to Cushing.  Gasoline Inventories  Gasoline inventories in the U.S. rose 119,000 barrels to
205.9 million in the week ended May 13. They were forecast to
increase 950,000 barrels, according to the median of 16 analyst
responses in the Bloomberg News survey. Stockpiles of distillate
fuel, a category that includes heating oil and diesel, slid 1.16
million barrels to 143.1 million, the lowest since April 2009.  “The Department of Energy bucked analyst expectations and
WTI reacted positively,”  Stephen Schork , president of the
Villanova, Pennsylvania-based Schork Group Inc., said in a note
to clients today. “However, the draw was well below the draw
seen in 2009 and 2008.”  Firefighters in northern  Alberta ,  Canada , may begin to gain
the upper hand over wildfires that shut a pipeline carrying
crude from oil-sands projects, Alberta Sustainable Resource
Development said.  Pipeline Shutdown  Fires forced Plains All American Pipeline LP to stop
cleanup work from an earlier  oil spill  and shut down its Rainbow
pipeline system on May 15. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.,
Cenovus Energy Inc. and other producers have said they may
curtail output because of the pipeline disruption.  Canada was the biggest source of U.S. oil imports last
year, providing  1.97 million barrels  a day, according to the
Energy Department.  A report today may show sales of existing homes in the U.S.
slowed. Sales rose 2 percent, or an annualized 5.1 million, in
May, down from 3.7 percent growth in April, according to the
median estimate of 75 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “People haven’t been so confident about a strong recovery
in the U.S., so the market is at a loss where to go,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity-derivative sales manager at brokerage
Newedge Group in  Tokyo . “It’s possible for crude to close below
$100 a barrel this week. Oil is in the center of a range between
$95 and $105 a barrel.”  In  Louisiana , 16 gates are open on the Morganza spillway,
diverting the engorged Mississippi’s excess into the Atchafalaya
River basin. The opening of the spillway for the first time
since 1973 eased the threat of flooding for  Baton Rouge ,  New
Orleans  and a major petrochemical zone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
