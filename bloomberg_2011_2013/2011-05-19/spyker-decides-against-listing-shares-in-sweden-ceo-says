Spyker Cars NV (SPYKR) , the Dutch company
that owns  Saab Automobile , today decided against listing its
shares in Stockholm, Chief Executive Officer Victor Muller said.  Spyker made the decision today at its shareholders meeting
in Zeewolde,  Netherlands , Muller said in a telephone interview.
The company, based in Zeewolde, last year started considering
whether to offer its shares on the Stockholm exchange in 2011 in
addition to its existing Amsterdam listing. It also considered
eventually ending the Amsterdam presence.  “There’s no point changing the listing now,” Muller said.
“We have other things to focus on, including getting a good
business going again. We’ll have to think about whether it’s any
point ever listing in  Stockholm .”  Saab, which accounts for virtually all of Spyker’s
business, first stopped production March 29 amid a payment
dispute with suppliers. Output has been halted since April 5,
and Saab aims to restart production late next week pending
negotiations with component makers.  Also at today’s meeting, Muller took the reins as interim
chief executive of Trollhaettan, Sweden-based Saab as Jan-Aake Jonsson retired.  Spyker today also approved a proposal to change its name to
Swedish Automobile NV. The change should take effect in a few
days, Muller said.  Spyker shares rose 1.9 percent today to 3.79 euros,
bringing its advance this year to 9.3 percent and giving it a
market value of 80.1 million euros ($115 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
