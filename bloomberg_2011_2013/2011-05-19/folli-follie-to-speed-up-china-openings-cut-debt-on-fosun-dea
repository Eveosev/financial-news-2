Ltd. (656) ’s acquisition of a 9.5 percent stake in the Greek retailing
company to reduce debt.  The company, whose activities include operating Hellenic
Duty Free Shops and manufacturing jewelry and handbags, plans to
build on common interests with Fosun in retailing, tourism tax-
free outlets, Folli-Follie Managing Director George Koutsolioutsos said.  “We are hopeful this will add value and reinforce the
brand in China,” Koutsolioutsos said in Athens today at a
