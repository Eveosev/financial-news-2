LinkedIn Corp.’s founder  Reid Hoffman 
and its three top venture backers own a combined stake of about
$5.14 billion after an eight-year wait for the first initial
public offering by a major U.S. social-media site.  Venture capitalists have led more than $100 million in
investments in  Mountain View , California-based LinkedIn since
2003, with  Sequoia Capital  amassing a holding now worth $1.59
billion, and Greylock Partners, a $1.32 billion stake. Hoffman,
LinkedIn’s chairman and biggest shareholder, holds $1.8 billion
and Bessemer Venture Partners has a stake worth $431.5 million.  The almost decade-long wait for a LinkedIn windfall
compares with less than five years for the biggest investors in
Google Inc. and just a year for top backers of Yahoo! Inc. and
 EBay Inc. (EBAY)  LinkedIn’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange today
at $45 a share, or a valuation of about $4.25 billion, brightens
prospects for the venture capital industry, which has lost money
over the past 10 years amid a dearth of IPOs.  “Any solid returns like this are clearly a great thing and
there’s been too few of them in the past decade,” said Eric Risley, founder of Architect Partners, a technology merger-and-
acquisition advisory firm in Menlo Park,  California . “This was
not an overnight success by any means.”  LinkedIn more than doubled, rising $49.25 to $94.25 at
4 p.m. New York time, after earlier soaring as high as $122.70.
At the stock’s closing price, LinkedIn’s market valuation is
$8.91 billion.  LinkedIn was valued at about $15 million when  Menlo Park ,
California-based Sequoia first  invested  in 2003, according to
two people familiar with the matter.  Hoffman’s Plans  Venture investors are barred from selling shares during a
so-called lockup period that lasts for six months after an IPO.
Venture capital firms typically keep 20 percent to 30 percent of
profit for their partners after portfolio companies get acquired
or go public. They distribute the rest to the pension funds,
endowments and foundations that invest in their funds.  Hoffman, a former PayPal Inc. executive, is selling less
than 1 percent of his stake. Hani Durzy, a spokesman for
LinkedIn, declined to comment, as did Mark Dempster, who heads
marketing for Sequoia.  Venture capitalists are counting on gains from LinkedIn and
other Web companies such as Pandora Media Inc. and HomeAway Inc.
Social-media companies Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc., Zynga Inc.
and Groupon Inc. have yet to announce IPO plans, even with
multibillion-dollar valuations on private markets.  Among the venture firms, Sequoia stands to be the biggest
winner from the LinkedIn IPO. The firm led a  $4.7 million 
investment in November 2003 and increased its funding  later  to
accumulate a 21 percent stake.  Greylock, Bessemer  Mike Moritz, who led Sequoia’s early investments in Google,
Yahoo and PayPal, joined LinkedIn’s board in January. He
replaced Mark Kvamme, who left Sequoia for a job at the Ohio
Department of Development.  Greylock Partners  led the  second round  of funding, a $10
million investment, in 2004. Greylock’s David Sze, who’s also an
investor in Facebook and Pandora, is a LinkedIn director.
Hoffman joined Greylock as a partner in 2009.  Bessemer, a century-old firm that made an early bet on
Skype Technologies SA, led a $12.8 million  round  in 2007.  Buyers of LinkedIn shares on the secondary markets are also
poised to profit. A $1 million purchase of LinkedIn stock on
Dec. 10, 2010, would now be worth more than $2.68 million, based
on the median secondary bid price that day, according to a
report today from Nyppex LLC, which specializes in secondary
transactions.  ‘Good Omen’  Nyppex, based in  Rye Brook ,  New York , tracks the value of
LinkedIn, Facebook, Zynga, Twitter and Groupon, which have
surged in the past year as some early investors and employees
sold equity. The valuations of leading consumer Internet
companies surged by a combined 51 percent in the first quarter
from the previous three months.  “The LinkedIn IPO valuation thus far is a good omen for
secondary buyers in certain other privately held social-media
companies,” Nyppex said.  LinkedIn trades under the ticker symbol LNKD. About 62
percent of the 7.84 million shares in the offering were sold by
LinkedIn, which said it plans to use the proceeds to fund
existing operations and to expand the business, possibly
including buying other companies or technologies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
