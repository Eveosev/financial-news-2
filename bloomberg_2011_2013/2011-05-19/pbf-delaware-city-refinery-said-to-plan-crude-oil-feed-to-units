PBF Energy Company LLC, which was
formed in 2008 to acquire refineries in the U.S., plans to start
units at its Delaware City, Delaware, plant, according to two
people with knowledge of the operations.  The refinery, shut since November 2009, is expected to
start units today, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information isnâ€™t public. A fluid
catalytic cracker, which makes gasoline, will start receiving
crude to enable its restart on May 22, and a hydrogen unit feed
is set to begin today, said one of the people.  PBF is standing by its expectation to start the plant in
the second quarter, Michael Gayda, Parsippany, New Jersey-based
president of PBF Energy, said in a telephone message yesterday.  PBF Energy, backed by private-equity firms Blackstone Group
LP and First Reserve Corp., bought the Delaware City plant from
Valero Energy Corp. for $220 million in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
