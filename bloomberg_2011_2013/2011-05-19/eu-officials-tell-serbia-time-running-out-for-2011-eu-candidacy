Serbia  quickly implement the
political, legal and economic changes needed to become an
official European Union candidate by the end of the year,
European Commission President  Jose Manuel Barroso  said.  “Indeed, 2011 is the year of crucial opportunity for
Serbia and  Europe ,” he told reporters in Belgrade today. “You
are on the right track, but time is running out.”  The Balkan nation’s progress in arresting and handing over
Mladic and former Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadzic to the war
crimes tribunal in the Hague Tribunal is one of the top
conditions Serbia must meet to start advancing toward its
accession to the EU, Barroso said, reiterating a stance the 27-
member bloc has held for several years.  The government plans to gain candidate status by the end of
2011 to follow former Yugoslav partners Slovenia, an EU member
since 2004 and Croatia, which seeks to conclude entry
negotiations this year.  Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic ’s administration, which
faces elections in a year, is implementing changes to improve
the judicial system and fight corruption and organized crime in
hopes of getting a positive assessment from EU Enlargement
Commissioner Stefan Fule on Oct. 12.  “Serbia needs to tackle” these issues, Cvetkovic told the
same news conference today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
