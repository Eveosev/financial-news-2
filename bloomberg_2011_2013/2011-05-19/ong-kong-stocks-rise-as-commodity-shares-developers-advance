Hong Kong stocks rose for a second
day as commodity producers advanced on higher oil and metal
prices, and as  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688)  led
property stocks higher.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s biggest offshore oil producer, advanced
1.5 percent, while Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s
largest producer of the lightweight metal, increased 1.6 percent.
China Overseas Land, controlled by the construction ministry,
extended yesterday’s gains, jumping 3.9 percent after Citigroup
Inc. added the stock to its top pick list, citing its
profitability.  Investors are “more bullish on China properties because it
has been in a tightening mode for a while, and the situation
cannot get much worse,” said  Alex Wong , asset-management
director at Ample Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The overall
sentiment is a bit biased on the upside, though I don’t think
investors are very bullish yet” about the broader market.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.7 percent to 23,163.38 at the
close, with more than four stocks rising for every one that fell
in the 45-member gauge. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
Chinese companies’ H shares increased 0.5 percent to 12,935.59.  Cnooc rose 1.5 percent to HK$18.16, the biggest contributor
to the Hang Seng Index’s advance, while PetroChina Co., the
country’s No. 1 company, advanced 0.6 percent to HK$10.64.
Aluminum Corp. of China gained 1.6 percent to HK$6.95 and
Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the metal, rose
0.8 percent to HK$24.90.  Commodities Rise  Crude oil for June delivery rose $3.19 to $100.10 a barrel
in New York yesterday after an Energy Department report showed
an unexpected drop in U.S. inventories as refineries bolstered
operating rates and imports declined. The London Metal Exchange
Index of six metals including copper and aluminum gained 2.9
percent yesterday, its highest level since May 4.  A measure of property stocks had the biggest gain among the
Hang Seng Index’s four industry groups. China Overseas Land
jumped 3.9 percent to HK$16.02. China Resources Land Ltd., a
state-controlled developer, increased 2.5 percent to HK$14.18.  China’s home prices advanced in 67 of 70 cities monitored
by the government in April from last year, according to a report
posted on the website of the country’s statistics bureau
yesterday. Housing prices increased faster in smaller cities
while the rate of advance slowed in larger cities, the report
showed.  The Chinese government has increased reserve ratio
requirements for major banks 11 times since January 2010 and
raised  interest rates  on four occasions since October as it
battles to restrain asset-price inflation. Curbs on lending for
second and third homes have also been imposed and Shanghai and
Chongqing have introduced taxes on property transactions.  Cheung Kong  (Holdings) Ltd., a developer controlled by
billionaire  Li Ka-shing , gained 2.7 percent to HK$118.80 after
saying Li bought 110,000 shares in the company.  U.S. Stimulus  The Hang Seng Index declined 3 percent this month through
yesterday as economic data from the U.S. and China’s measures to
curb inflation boosted concern global economic growth may slow.
Shares in the gauge traded at an average 12.1 times forecast
earnings yesterday, compared with 14.4 times at the end of last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stocks also rose after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled
interest rates will remain low. Minutes of the Fed’s April
policy meeting said that talks about an exit strategy from
record stimulus measures don’t mean monetary tightening “would
necessarily begin soon.”  Futures on the Hang Seng Index advanced 0.8 percent to
23,150. The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for  Hong
Kong  stock options, fell 2.9 percent to 17.34, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 5 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
