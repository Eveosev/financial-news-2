Lael Brainard, the  U.S. Treasury ’s
undersecretary for international affairs, said international
institutions are central to American efforts overseas.  “The multilateral institutions are vital supporters of our
international agenda,” Brainard said in prepared remarks for a
speech to the annual meeting of the Bretton Woods Committee.  Her comments come as the International Monetary Fund
searches for new leadership after the resignation of  Dominique Strauss-Kahn , who has been charged with sexual assault. Brainard
echoed statements earlier today from Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner , calling for the IMF to move quickly and praising
 John Lipsky , the fund’s No. 2 official, who is now the temporary
leader.  Brainard said the U.S. believes the IMF will be able to
move quickly to select a successor through an open process. She
also said the IMF is playing a “critical role” in the world
and that the U.S. wants the fund to be as strong as it can be.  “We haven’t taken a position on any particular
candidate,” she said, in response to a question at the event.  Brainard said the U.S. needs to take steps to strengthen
its domestic economy and public finances, along with its efforts
to influence developments overseas.  “Providing leadership to advance our values and our goals
is more important than ever,” Brainard said. “It is important
that the United States lead from a position of strength.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
