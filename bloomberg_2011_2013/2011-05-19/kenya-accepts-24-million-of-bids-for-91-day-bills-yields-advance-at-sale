Kenya accepted 2.1 billion shillings
of bids for its 91-day treasury bills at an auction where demand
exceeded supply and yields rose.  The East African nation had offered 2 billion shillings of
the securities and received 3.6 billion shillings of bids, the
 Central Bank  of Kenya said today in an e-mailed statement. The
weighted average yield on accepted bids climbed to 6.409 percent
from 4.796 percent at the previous sale.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
