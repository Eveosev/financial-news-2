Amtrak  is asking investors to submit
proposals by June 10 to help finance its  plan  for 220-mile-per-
hour train service in the Northeast corridor, Al Engel, vice
president of high-speed rail, said.  “We want to engage the private sector as much as we can,”
Engel said at a press briefing today at the U.S. passenger rail
service’s  Washington  headquarters.  Amtrak’s $117 billion plan calls for the taxpayer-supported
railroad to develop and operate the high-speed service. It would
be completed by 2040 and serve the corridor between Boston and
Washington. At least half the money would need to come from
government sources, Engel said.  “Twenty-six entities have applied” after a request for
proposals “and a number of them are investment bankers,” Engel
said. “I don’t expect to get 26 proposals,” he added.  “We’re moving as fast as we can, as soon as we can, to
line up the funding to advance the program,” Engel said. He
declined to say how much money Amtrak hopes to get from
investors.  Amtrak on  May 9  was awarded $450 million from the $2
billion in U.S. rail grants that Florida rejected to upgrade a
24-mile track segment in  New Jersey  and outside of Philadelphia
to support trains running up to 160 mph.  Amtrak’s Acela Express averages 83 mph in most of the
Northeast Corridor and can reach a top speed of 150 mph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
