The U.S. Energy Department’s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies rose 5 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories gained 91 billion cubic feet in the week ended May
13 to 1.918 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for June delivery fell 5.4 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $4.144 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange at 10:23 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
