Romania’s biggest oil company  OMV
Petrom SA (SNP)  is in talks with the government to renew its
exploration licenses, which expire in September and were granted
to the company before it was sold to Austria’s  OMV AG (OMV) , the
Vienna-based company said.  Failure to renew the licenses or a renewal delay would have
“a material adverse effect on Petrom’s business, results of
operations and financial condition,” majority-owner OMV said in
the prospectus of a planned share sale on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
