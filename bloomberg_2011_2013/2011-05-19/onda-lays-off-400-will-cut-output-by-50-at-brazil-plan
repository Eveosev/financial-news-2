Honda Motor Co.’s  Brazil  unit laid
off 400 workers at its Sumare plant and will reduce output there
by half due to a shortage of electronic parts from  Japan . The
lay-offs equate to 12 percent of staff at the unit.  The plant will cut daily output to 300 units from 600 and
reduce its three shifts to two starting in June, Honda said in
an e-mailed statement.  Shipments of auto parts to several countries were delayed
as Japanese suppliers were affected by the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami, the company said.  “Honda hopes to return to its regular activity level as
soon as the situation goes back to normal”, Honda said.  The automaker forecasts a drop of 30 percent for production
and 20 percent for sales in Brazil this year, O Estado de S.
Paulo newspaper  reported  today, citing Paulo Takeuchi, director
of the automaker in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
