The pound may extend a loss toward
the lowest level since April 1, Gaitame.com Research Institute
Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  A trend line connecting the lows of Jan. 7 and March 28
seems to have capped the pound’s upward momentum since the
currency fell below the line, said Tsuyoshi Okada, managing
director at Gaitame.com in  Tokyo . The pound also has traded
below its 20- and 60-day moving averages, Okada said.  “A strong trend of buying the pound seems to be tapering
off,” Okada said yesterday. “The pound is likely to test lower
prices for a while.”  The currency may drop toward $1.6065, which lies on another
trend line connecting the lows of Dec. 28 and 29 exists,
according to Okada. The pound last traded below that level on
April 1. It fetched $1.6228 as of 8:04 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.6237 in  New York  yesterday.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
