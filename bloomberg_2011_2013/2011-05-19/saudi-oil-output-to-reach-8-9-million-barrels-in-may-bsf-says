Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest
crude exporter, may pump about 8.9 million barrels a day in May
as demand from refiners globally picks up and  Japan  raises
imports of the nation’s oil, a local economist said.  “May’s output should show an increase of 100,000 to
200,000 barrels a day from April as markets are well supplied,”
John Sfakianakis, chief economist at Riyadh-based Banque Saudi
Fransi, said in a telephone interview.  April output levels should be about 8.7 million barrels a
day, equalling that of March, he said. Exports will increase in
May as Saudi Arabia will sell more of the crude it had
stockpiled during the previous two months, Sfakianakis said.  “ Saudi Aramco  had stockpiled a lot of oil locally and
abroad at Rotterdam and Sidi Kerir sites,” he said. “They need
to sell from those first.” Aramco is the state oil company.  Crude inventories in Saudi Arabia increased by 12.2 million
barrels, or 4.7 percent, in March from a month earlier,
according to official data.  The holder of the world’s largest proven oil reserves had
269.4 million barrels of crude in storage within its territory
by the end of March, compared with 257.2 million barrels in
February, the government figures posted yesterday on the Joint
Organization Data Initiative  website  show.  Saudi Arabia pumped 8.66 million barrels of oil a day in
March, down 365,000 barrels a day, or 4 percent, from 9.02
million a day in the previous month, the official data showed.  The kingdom exported 6.54 million barrels a day in March,
for a monthly decrease of 6.5 percent, according to the figures.
