South Africa  plans to start building
locomotives domestically, according to Malusi Gigaba, the
country’s minister of public enterprises.  Of the nation’s 1,700 trains, only about 680 are currently
operational, he told reporters in Johannesburg today.  Of 100  General Electric Co. (GE)  locomotives ordered by South
Africa’s state-owned Transnet Ltd., 10 will be made in the U.S.
and the remaining 90 will be manufactured in South Africa,
Gigaba said.  Transnet plans to spend 110 billion rand ($16 billion)
expanding ports and railways in the next five years, the
minister added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
