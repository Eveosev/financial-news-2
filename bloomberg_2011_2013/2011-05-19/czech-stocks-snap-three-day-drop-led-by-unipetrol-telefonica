The Czech Republic’s main stock index
rose, ending a three-day sell-off as  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  said it
may repay state aid next month and speculation U.S. interest
rates will remain low boosted confidence in the global recovery.  The 15-member PX gauge added 0.8 percent to 1,254.1 at its
4:28 p.m. in  Prague , its biggest one-day advance in two weeks.
The index lost 1.7 percent in the previous three sessions.  Austria’s Erste, which accounts for 17 percent of the PX’s
weighting, climbed 0.6 percent to 824.1 koruna after Chief
Executive Officer Andreas Treichl said the lender would like to
repay 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in state capital it
received in 2009 before the end of June.  European stocks rallied after  James Bullard , president of
the Federal Bank of  St. Louis , said the central bank may keep
its monetary policy unchanged until late this year, and that
declining inflation expectations have reduced the need to begin
withdrawing record stimulus.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of Societe Generale SA,
advanced 1.3 percent to 4,184 koruna, its biggest one-day rally
in five weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
