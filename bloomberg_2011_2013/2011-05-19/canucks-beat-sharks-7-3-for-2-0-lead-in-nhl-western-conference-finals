The  Vancouver Canucks  beat the San
Jose Sharks 7-3 to lead their National Hockey League playoff
series by two games to none.  The Canucks are chasing their first NHL title, having twice
lost in the Stanley Cup finals, most recently in 1994. The
Sharks have never reached the championship series in their 19
major league seasons.  The winner of the best-of-seven Western Conference finals
will play the  Boston Bruins  or Tampa Bay Lightning in the
Stanley Cup finals.  The Eastern Conference finals resume tomorrow at St. Pete
Times Forum in Tampa, with the teams tied at one game apiece.
The Western Conference series continues May 20 at San Jose.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
