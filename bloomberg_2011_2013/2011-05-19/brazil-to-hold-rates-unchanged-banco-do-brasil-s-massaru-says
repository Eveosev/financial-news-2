Brazil’s central bank will likely
hold benchmark interest rates unchanged at its monetary meeting
next month, said Carlos Massaru, head of  Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3) ’s
asset management arm.  Actions the committee has already taken, “were correct and
having the desired impact,” Massaru, chief executive officer at
BB Gestao de Recursos  - Distribuidora de Titulos e Valores
Mobiliarios SA,  said today in  Sao Paulo . The investment manager
is Brazil’s largest, with $480 billion reais ($297.1 billion)
under management.  The monetary policy committee will likely consider raising
rates in the second half of the year, Massaru said. The central
bank has raised the benchmark lending rate 3.25 percentage
points since April 2010 to 12 percent to curb inflation. In the
12 months through April, inflation soared to 6.51 percent,
surpassing the government’s target range for the first time
since 2005.  Brazil is likely to have  interest rates  “compatible” with
those in developed nations in about two years, Massaru said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
