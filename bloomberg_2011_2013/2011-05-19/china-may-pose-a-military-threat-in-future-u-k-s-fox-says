China  is a potential military threat
as it asserts its claim to natural resources and comes under
strain from an ageing population, U.K. Defense Secretary  Liam Fox  said.  “We can’t gamble on the fact that China wouldn’t pose a
military threat in the future and it would be prudent for the
U.S. and its allies to prepare for that,” Fox told the Chatham
House foreign-policy research institute in  London  today.  “China has major challenges in its demographics and
supplies of national resources and I suppose we will be looking
at China as it deals with the unavoidable social and economic
problems that it may have,” Fox said. China may react by
liberalizing, Fox said. Alternatively, it may “repress” or
“externalize as a response,” he said.  Fox’s comments echo those of Prime Minister  David Cameron , who in a televised leadership debate before taking
power last year cited uncertainty over China as one of the
reasons for Britain to maintain its nuclear deterrent.  Cameron’s comments drew an instant reprimand from the then
ruling  Labour Party , which pointed out that China is a fellow
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.  “I neither take the view that we should be overly
optimistic about where China is going, nor should we be paranoid
about where China is going,” Fox said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
