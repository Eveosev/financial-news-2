Accenture Plc (ACN)  Chief Executive Officer
Pierre Nanterme said the company is less interested in large
takeovers of companies such as consultants Roland Berger, and
more inclined to consider smaller acquisitions,  Die Welt 
reported, citing an interview.  “Our strategy was always clear: we’re interested
particularly in companies that possess very deep knowledge about
niche areas,” the newspaper cited Nanterme as saying. He said
the company will focus growth on emerging markets in regions
such as southeast  Asia , according to Die Welt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
