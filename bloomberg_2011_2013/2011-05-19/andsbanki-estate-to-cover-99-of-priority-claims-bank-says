The resolution committee of failed
Landsbanki Islands hf said its estate will cover 99 percent of
all priority claims filed against it, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  Landsbanki said it hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch and
 UBS AG (UBSN)  to advise it on a possible sale of its 67 percent stake
in Iceland Foods Group Ltd.  “According to UBS and BAML, market conditions are
currently favorable and it is therefore advisable to commence
the sales process,” according to the statement. “In view
thereof, the bank’s resolution committee has decided to launch a
formal sales process for the bank’s holding in the company.”  The bank also said a formal sales process was recently
started for its 66 percent holding in Aurum Group, according to
the same statement. Aurum comprises the retail chains Mappin &
Webb, Goldsmiths and Watches of  Switzerland . Landsbanki hired
Cavendish Corporate Finance in the U.K. to advise on the
divestment, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
