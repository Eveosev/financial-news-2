Hungarian commercial banks further
tightened lending conditions on companies in the first quarter
because of a shortage of capital and funding from abroad, the
central bank said.  Banks attributed the more restrictive loan conditions to
their reduced ability to lend, while they cited  risk aversion 
as the main reason in the previous survey,  Magyar Nemzeti Bank 
in Budapest said on its website today, based on its April survey
of lenders. The banks also said any easing of credit conditions
in the future is unlikely, according to the report.  “Banks cited tightened and more costly access to external
foreign currency funding and a weak ability to accumulate and
attract capital stemming from low profitability as the main
factors contributing to tightening,” the regulator said in the
report.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  imposed special taxes on
banking, energy, retail and telecommunication companies last
year to plug budget holes. OTP Bank Nyrt, the largest Hungarian
lender, said today that first-quarter profit fell 12 percent
after the special tax cut earnings. OTP competes mostly with
units of international banks, including  Raiffeisen Bank
International AG (RBI) ,  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Bayerische Landesbank .  The survey’s findings were based on written responses from
bank officials. The corporate lending questionnaire was
completed by seven banks accounting for 81 percent of lending to
companies and 93 percent of commercial real-estate lending, the
central bank said.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
