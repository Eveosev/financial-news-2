     May 19 (Bloomberg) -- Fernando Alonso , the two-time Formula
One world champion, extended his contract with Ferrari until the
end of the 2016 season, the Italian team said.  Alonso, a 29-year-old Spaniard, joined Ferrari on a three-
year contract in September 2009, after winning two drivers’
championships with Renault.  “I immediately felt comfortable within Ferrari and now it
feels to me like a second family,” Alonso said in an e-mailed
statement. “It is therefore natural for me to decide to extend
my relationship in the long term like this, with a team at which
I will no doubt end my Formula One career one day.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
