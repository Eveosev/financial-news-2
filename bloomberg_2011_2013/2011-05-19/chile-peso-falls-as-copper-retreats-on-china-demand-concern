Chile’s peso rose against the  U.S.
dollar , erasing an earlier decline, as gains in global equity
markets spurred demand for riskier, emerging market assets.  The peso climbed 0.3 percent to 467.95 per dollar from
469.25 yesterday after sliding as much as 0.2 percent earlier.  “Global markets were slightly higher,” said Eugenio Cortes, head currency forwards trader at Euroamerica Corredores
de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “The peso had fallen on recent days on
dollar demand from abroad and that demand ended.”  U.S. stocks rose, pushing up the  Standard & Poor’s  index as
much as 0.5 percent, after initial jobless claims fell more than
expected. The central bank paid an average 468.35 per dollar for
$50 million today as part of a $12 billion effort to limit the
peso’s gains, according to data posted on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
