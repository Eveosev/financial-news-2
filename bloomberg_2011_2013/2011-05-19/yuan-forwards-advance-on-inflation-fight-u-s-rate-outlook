China ’s yuan forwards strengthened
for a third day on optimism policy makers will allow faster
gains to quell inflation as near-zero U.S.  interest rates  weigh
on the dollar.  China should raise the deposit rate to eliminate negative
real interest rates, the 21st Century Business Herald reported
today, citing central bank adviser  Li Daokui . Currencies gained
across the region’s 10 biggest economies after minutes of the
Federal Open Market Committee’s last meeting showed policy
makers preferred to reverse record monetary stimulus by ending
reinvestment of asset proceeds before raising interest rates.  “There are expectations China will have to tighten
monetary policy via the currency,” said Ho Woei Chen, an
economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in  Singapore . “Today, it
seems the  U.S. dollar  is pulling back and part of it has to do
with the Fed minutes. Asian currencies are recovering against
the dollar and the renminbi is strengthening in line.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards for the yuan rose
0.14 percent to 6.3675 per dollar as of 11:24 a.m. in Hong Kong,
a 2.1 premium to the spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yuan was 0.03 percent higher at 6.5029 in Shanghai,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The
currency reached 6.4892 on April 29, the strongest level since
1993. It isn’t allowed to move more than 0.5 percent either side
of the central bank’s daily fixing, which was raised 0.04
percent to 6.5048. In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan rose
0.05 percent to 6.4945.  A stronger currency helps tame inflation by reducing the
cost of imports. Consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from
a year earlier following a 5.4 percent increase in March that
was the biggest since July 2008. The government aims to limit
inflation to 4 percent this year.  The U.S. central bank may keep its monetary policy
unchanged until late this year and declining inflation
expectations have curbed the need to begin withdrawing record
stimulus, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James
Bullard  said in an interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
