Standard Bank  Group Ltd., South
Africa’s biggest lender, now plans to expand in Nigeria by
building the business on its own after registering earlier this
year to buy distressed lenders there.  “At the moment it makes more sense to grow that business
organically,” Clive Tasker, head of the bank’s African unit,
said in an interview today at a conference on nutrition and
rural development in Washington. “We made an acquisition a few
years ago; we’ve done that very successfully.”  Standard Bank and  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , both based in
Johannesburg, had registered with Nigeria’s central bank in
January to investigate buying distressed lenders in the West
African nation.  Standard Bank already operates in Nigeria as Stanbic IBTC
Plc after buying a Lagos-based lender in 2007. The company has
dropped 7.1 percent this year, making it the worst performer in
the six-member FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index, which has declined
1.3 percent. FirstRand has climbed 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
