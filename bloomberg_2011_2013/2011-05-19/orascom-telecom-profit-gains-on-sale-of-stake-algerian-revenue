Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , North
Africa’s biggest mobile-phone operator, said first-quarter
profit surged on the sale of its stake in a Tunisian holding and
as revenue of its Algerian unit grew.  Net income rose to $813 million in the three months ended
March 31, compared with $48.8 million in the year-earlier
period, the Cairo-based company said in a statement on its
website yesterday. The company recognized a gain of $754 million
from the sale of its 50 percent stake in Orascom Telecom
 Tunisia , or  Tunisiana , in January.  In  Algeria , Orascom said the government continues to
restrict the operations of its local unit Djezzy. The company
raised its market share in the country to 58 percent and
increased revenue by 6 percent.  Orascom has “countered to the extent possible by effective
cost management,” said Executive Chairman Khaled Bichara in a
statement. Algerian government restrictions included those on
“foreign currency transfers, import bans and advertising bans
on government-owned television,” Bichara said.  Orascom Telecom’s parent company, Wind Telecom SpA,
finalized a merger with Russia’s  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  last week,
creating the world’s sixth-biggest mobile phone company in a
$6.5 billion transaction. The deal was completed after Orascom
shareholders voted to almost double their company’s capital to
14 billion Egyptian pounds ($2.4 billion), restructure debt and
create a new company to hold the assets not included in the
merger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
