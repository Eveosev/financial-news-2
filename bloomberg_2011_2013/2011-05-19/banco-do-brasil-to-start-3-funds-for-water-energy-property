Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3)  may add three
funds in by August to invest in the fields of water, renewable
energy and homebuilding, said head of the bank’s asset
management arm Carlos Massaru.  One fund will focus on publicly-traded water companies both
in  Brazil  and abroad, the head of BB Gestao de Recursos  -
Distribuidora de Titulos e Valores Mobiliarios SA, the largest
investment manager in the country with $480 billion reais
($297.2 billion) under management, told journalists today in Sao
Paulo.  A second fund will be for domestic renewable energy
companies, and a third will focus on commercial real estate,
Massaru said.  “We subscribed to the United Nations principles of
responsible investment last year and we’re betting a lot on some
opportunities in areas that have this approach,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
