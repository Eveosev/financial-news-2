Germany ’s Ifo Institute said it will
reweight its business climate indicator and update the time
line’s base year, resulting in “significant” revisions.  Business confidence for April was revised to 114.2 from
110.4 before the revision,  Munich-based Ifo  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The assessment of current conditions was
revised to 121.0 from 116.3, while expectations stood at 107.7
in April, compared with 104.7 before the changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
