German electricity prices may rise by
6 percent if eight nuclear reactors shut because of the
moratorium imposed by Chancellor  Angela Merkel  don’t start,
according to the German Institute for Economic Research.  Power prices in  Europe ’s biggest market may reach 65.30
euros ($93) a megawatt-hour if the units don’t start, the
institute, also called DIW Berlin, said today in a report on its
website. The calculation is based on a hypothetical price for
2011 based on DIW’s computer model, it said.  Merkel on March 15 ordered the halt of  Germany ’s seven
oldest reactors, removing about 25 percent of the country’s
20,700 megawatts of atomic capacity, after radiation spilled
from the Japanese nuclear plant at Fukushima.  Wholesale power for the third quarter in the over-the-
counter market is trading at 60 euros a megawatt-hour, 2 euros
below a three-year high on March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
