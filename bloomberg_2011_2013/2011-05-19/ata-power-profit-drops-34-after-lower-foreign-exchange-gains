Tata Power Co.,  India ’s largest non-
state electricity utility, posted a 34 percent decline in
fourth-quarter profit after a drop in foreign-exchange gains.  Net income, including that of units, fell to 6.25 billion
rupees ($139 million) in the three months ended March 31 from
9.47 billion rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company
said in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange today. The
average estimate of 9 analysts compiled by Bloomberg was a
profit of 5.5 billion rupees.  The decline in profit was mainly due to lower foreign-
exchange gains of 610 million rupees from unit Coastal Gujarat
Power Ltd. compared with 3.58 billion rupees last year, Tata
Power said. The unit is implementing a 4,000 megawatt project at
Mundra in the western state of Gujarat.  Tata Power fell 2.8 percent to 1,215.90 rupees at the close
in Mumbai trading. The stock has fallen 11 percent this year
compared with a 12 percent decline in the benchmark Sensitive
Index. The earnings were announced after the market closed.  The company’s board recommended splitting each share into
10, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
