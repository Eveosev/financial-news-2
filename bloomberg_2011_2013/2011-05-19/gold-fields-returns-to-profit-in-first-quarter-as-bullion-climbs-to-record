Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the world’s fourth-
largest producer of the metal, posted a first-quarter profit,
helped by rising bullion prices and as a stake sale to black
investors in the preceding period wasn’t repeated.  Profit excluding one-time items was 1.1 billion rand ($159
million), or 1.51 rand a share, compared with a loss of 776
million rand, or 1.09 rand, in the previous three months, the
Johannesburg-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
who track South African gold producers compare consecutive
quarters, rather than year-on-year numbers.  Gold rose to a record $1,447.82 an ounce in London trading
in the first quarter, helping Gold Fields and competitors
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and Harmony Gold Mining Co. mitigate the
effect of rising power and labor costs in  South Africa . Gold
Fields posted a fourth-quarter loss after selling a stake in the
company to black South Africans to comply with the country’s
ownership rules.  Production fell 8 percent to 830,000 ounces in the period
from 898,000 ounces in the fourth quarter, Gold Fields said.
Barrick Gold Corp., Newmont Mining Corp. and AngloGold are the
largest producers of the metal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
