Sugar may rise next week on signs
that output is dropping in  Brazil , the world’s biggest grower.  Seven of 11 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said that raw sugar traded in  New York  probably
will advance. Two forecast a loss, and two said prices would be
little changed. Before today, futures for July delivery gained
1.7 percent this week, closing yesterday at 21.82 cents a pound.  Seven of 11 respondents said refined sugar on London’s NYSE
Liffe exchange will advance. Two said prices will fall, and two
expected little change. Through yesterday, futures gained 2.6
percent this week to $618.50 a metric ton.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener probably will
widen next week, according to seven of 11 respondents. Three
forecast little change, and one said the spread will narrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
