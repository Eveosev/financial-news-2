Global stocks rose for a second day
after U.S. jobless claims decreased more than forecast and
companies announced $22 billion of takeovers. LinkedIn Corp.
more than doubled in the professional-networking company’s
trading debut. Commodities tumbled, led by nickel and sugar.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of stocks increased 0.3 percent at
4:45 p.m. in New York and rose 1.4 percent in its two-day
rebound from a five-day slump. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
advanced 0.2 percent to 1,343.6. The 10-year Treasury yield
slipped one basis point to 3.17 percent. The S&P GSCI Index of
24 raw materials slumped 1.1 percent, as nickel and sugar
tumbled more than 4.5 percent. Oil retreated 1.7 percent on
concern demand may weaken as the economy struggles to recover.  U.S. equities extended a global advance as jobless claims
declined by 29,000 to 409,000 last week, bolstering confidence
in the economy. Federal Reserve minutes released yesterday
showed officials are in no hurry to raise  interest rates . The
 S&P 500  followed a 0.7 percent advance in the Stoxx 600 Europe
Index after Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. agreed to buy closely held
Nycomed for 9.6 billion euros ($13.7 billion) and Toshiba Corp.
offered $2.3 billion for Swiss electronic-metering company
Landis+Gyr AG.  “The rally will accelerate,” said  Philip Orlando , the New
York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors
Inc., which oversees $358.2 billion. “We had an excellent
jobless claims number, which tells me that we’re going to see a
solid jobs report. The Fed has indicated that it will be
vigilant and watching the pace of jobs recovery,” he said.
“We’ll continue with easy policy.”  Jobless Claims  Gains in the S&P 500 were led by industrial and telephone
companies, with only health-care stocks retreating among 10
groups.  American Express Co. (AXP) ,  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  and  Boeing Co. (BA) 
climbed at least 1.1 percent to lead the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  up 45.14 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,605.32.  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO)  jumped 4.2 percent after
agreeing to buy Phadia AB for about $3.5 billion to grow in
testing for allergies and autoimmune diseases.  Intel Corp. (INTC) , KLA-
Tencor Corp. and  Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT)  slumped at least 1.2
percent as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its ratings on the
stocks amid increased competition and excess supply.  The S&P 500 extended its 2011 gain to 6.8 percent amid
improving earnings. Profits beat analysts’ estimates at 72
percent of the 450 companies that reported results since April
11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Global per-share
earnings will rise 18 percent this year, faster than an earlier
forecast, Citigroup Inc. said.  Economic Data  Earlier today, stocks turned lower after a report showed
that sales of existing homes unexpectedly declined in April,
indicating the industry is struggling to gain traction as the
economy expands. Separate figures from the  Federal Reserve 
showed that manufacturing in the Philadelphia unexpectedly grew
in May at the slowest pace in seven months, a sign the world’s
largest economy may get less of a boost from the industry that
led it out of the recession.  Unlike stocks, commodities did not recoup all their earlier
losses. Oil for June delivery fell 1.7 percent to $98.44 a
barrel in New York. Prices have risen 41 percent in the past
year. Sugar ended a five-day rally, the longest of the year, as
global supply concerns eased amid surging production in
 Thailand , the world’s second-biggest exporter. Cocoa and coffee
also fell.  Commodities Slump  Copper fell in New York for the first time in a week after
 Hong Kong  said it may ask some banks to set aside more reserves,
fueling concern that  China  will take additional steps to slow
inflation and economic growth.  All but four of the 24 materials tracked by the S&P GSCI
Index retreated. Industrial commodities fell 1.9 percent to lead
declines, followed by decreases of 1.1 percent in energy and
agricultural commodities, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Eighteen of 19 of the main industry groups in the Stoxx 600
advanced as about four stocks gained for every one that fell.

order for 111 turbines for a U.S. project.  BP Plc (BP/)  rose 1.6
percent as Bank of America Corp. advised buying the shares.  Glencore International Plc, the commodities company that
sold $10 billion of stock in the world’s biggest initial share
sale this year, ended its first trading day in  London  at the
same 530-pence price offered to investors.  Asian Shares  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.3 percent after  Japan 
reported its economy shrank more than estimated last quarter and
Gartner Inc. said Samsung Electronics Co.’s market share in
mobile devices declined.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average dropped 0.4 percent after the
first gross domestic product report since the March 11
earthquake showed the nation entered its third recession in a
decade.  The FTSE 100 Index rallied for a second day in London,
climbing 0.6 percent. British retail sales including auto fuel
climbed 1.1 percent from March, the  Office for National
Statistics  said today in London. The increase topped the 0.8
percent median forecast of 20 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the Spanish 30-year bond climbed four basis
points to 5.40 after the government sold 3.2 billion euros of
