Spanish 10-year bonds stayed lower
after the nation sold fewer bonds than planned at an auction, as
investor demand for the country’s debt declined amid lingering
concern over  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The Iberian-nation’s benchmark debt fell for a third day,
after the country sold 3.2 billion euros of 10-year and 30-year
bonds, below the maximum target of 4 billion euros, the Bank of
 Spain  said. Investors bid for 1.83 times the amount offered of
the 10-year securities, compared with 2.1 at the previous
auction, according to the central bank. Bids for 30-year debt
exceeded supply by 1.97 times, compared with 2.06 previously.  Yields on 10-year Spanish bonds were seven basis points
higher at 5.43 percent as of 9:55 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
