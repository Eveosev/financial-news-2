The new leadership of the
 International Monetary Fund  should reflect changes in the world
economic order and be more representative of emerging market
economies, People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said.  The selection of IMF senior leaders should be open and
transparent and take into account candidates’ “achievements,
capabilities, diligence and virtues,” Zhou said in comments
posted on the central bank’s website today after  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  resigned as the fund’s managing director today.  Zhou’s comments, given in a three-paragraph response to a
journalist’s question, echoed those of Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Jiang Yu. Speaking at a regular briefing in Beijing
today, Jiang said IMF leadership should be chosen on the basis
of “impartiality” and “merit,” and that developing nations
should be represented.  Zhou said he regretted Strauss-Kahn’s decision to resign.
The 62-year-old former head of the IMF was today charged with
attempting to rape a New York hotel maid.  John Lipsky , the first
deputy managing director at the fund, is serving as acting
managing director. He is due to retire later this year.  “The global economy is recovering slowly from the
financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis is still
in a turbulent and sensitive period,” Zhou said. “The support
of a strong and powerful IMF is needed to overcome  Europe ’s
current difficulties and ensure the world economy develops in a
robust, sustainable and balanced way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
