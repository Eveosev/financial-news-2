Clive Woodward said he won’t be
interviewed for the post of performance director at  England ’s
Rugby Football Union and pledged his commitment to the British
Olympic Association.  Woodward, who coached England to the 2003 World Cup title,
had been linked in reports in the Sunday Times and the Daily
Telegraph with a return to the RFU following a restructuring of
the organization. He said he’ll concentrate on his duties with
the BOA ahead of next year’s London Games.  “Since the Rugby Football Union announced its
restructuring plan late last year, there has been considerable
speculation that I might return,” Woodward said in a  statement 
released by the BOA. “I am totally committed to my role as
director of sport at the British Olympic Association and deputy
chef de mission for Team GB in  London  2012.”  Woodward said he’d spoken informally with “senior
figures” at the RFU about the role but had not held official
talks.  “In order to prevent any further speculation and in the
interests of both the BOA and RFU, I would like to formally
confirm that I will not be attending any interviews for this
position,” he said. “May I wish the RFU all the best in its
search to find the appropriate candidate for this very important
role for English rugby going forward.”  The 2011 Rugby World Cup will be held in  New Zealand  from
Sept. 9 to Oct. 23. England reached the final four years ago in
France, where it lost 15-6 to  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
