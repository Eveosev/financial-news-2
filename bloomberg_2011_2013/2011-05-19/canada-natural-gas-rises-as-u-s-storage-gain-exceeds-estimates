Canadian natural gas fell after the
U.S. Energy Department reported an increase in inventories last
week that was higher than analysts expected.  Stockpiles of the fuel in the U.S. rose 92 billion cubic
feet to 1.919 trillion in the week ended May 13, the department
said. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg called for an
increase of 90 billion. New supplies of gas from shale
formations in  Canada  and the U.S. have crimped price gains.  “We don’t see prices increasing simply because of the
supply situation,” said Darcy Johnson, a market analyst at
Canada’s National Energy Board, during a briefing today in
Calgary. Prices in the coming months for natural gas probably
will average between $4 and $5, the NEB estimates.  Alberta  gas for June delivery dropped 11 cents, or 3.1
percent, to C$3.48 per gigajoule ($3.40 per million British
thermal units) as of 2:30 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX, 
a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange goes to
users in Canada and the U.S. and is priced on TransCanada
Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 10.4 cents to $4.094 per million Btu.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near  Chicago 
fell 7.52 cents to $4.2215 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western
Canada.  Flow Rates  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas slipped 4.89 cents to $3.9699 per million Btu,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was down 4.04 cents to $4.0967.  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3 billion cubic
feet as of 1:30 p.m. in  New York , 168 million above its target
level. Some Alberta producers have been forced to shut gas wells
because of forest fires in the northern portion of the province.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.76 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.64 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 537 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.44 billion cubic feet today, about 73 percent of its
capacity of 1.98 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3
billion cubic feet at 1:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
