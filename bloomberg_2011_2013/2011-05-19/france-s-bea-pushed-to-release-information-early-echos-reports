France’s air-safety investigator, the
BEA, is under pressure from the government to quickly release a
report on causes of the Air France crash in June 2009,  Les Echos 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Transport Minister Thierry Mariani had talks two days ago
with BEA director Jean-Paul Troadec on a fast release of
information recovered from the Airbus A330’s black boxes, or
flight-data and cockpit recorders, the French daily said.  Airbus SAS, the aircraft’s manufacturer, wants to reassure
potential buyers ahead of the  Paris Air Show  next month, the
newspaper said. Lawyers for families of victims may also begin
demanding transcripts of the recordings for evidence in
lawsuits, Echos reported.  Investigators of the Air France Flight 447 crash said May
16 they successfully recovered the full contents of the black
boxes. The plane plunged into the Atlantic en route from  Rio de
Janeiro  to Paris, killing all 228 people onboard.  To contact the reporters on this story:
