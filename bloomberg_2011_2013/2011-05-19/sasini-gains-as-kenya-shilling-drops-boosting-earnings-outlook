Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , a Kenyan tea and coffee
producer, advanced the most in 1-1/2 months as the shilling
traded near a 17-year low, boosting the local-currency value of
the country’s exports.  The stock gained 0.45 shilling, or 4.6 percent, to 10.35
shillings at the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, the
biggest jump since April 5.  “We export 90 percent of our tea and at the current
exchange rates, it means farmers earnings in shilling terms will
be higher this year,” Wycliffe Masinde, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
0.4 percent to 87.15 per dollar yesterday, the weakest since
March 1994. The shilling last traded 0.9 percent stronger at
86.20 per dollar.  “The economic survey released by the government this week
shows agriculture grew 6.3 percent in 2010 compared with a
decline of 2.6 percent in 2009. This should give some confidence
to the market,” Masinde added.  According to the survey released May 17, growth in the
agricultural sector, which accounts for a quarter of gross
domestic product, boosted  Kenya ’s economic growth to 5.6 percent
in 2010 compared with 2.6 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
