Brazil ’s Chamber of Deputies may
block a government proposal setting a limit on the growth of its
payroll expenditures, Valor Economico newspaper reported.  The government proposal would limit at 2.5 percent plus
inflation the annual increase of  government spending  on public
employees’ wages, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said, citing an
interview with Pepe Vargas, a federal Workers Party’s deputy,
who is sponsoring the bill at the lower house.  Telephone calls made by Bloomberg News to Vargas’s office
in Brasilia were unanswered. Vargas didn’t reply to an e-mail
seeking comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
