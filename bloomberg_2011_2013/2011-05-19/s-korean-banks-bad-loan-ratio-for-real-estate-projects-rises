The bad-loan ratio for South Korean
bank lending for real-estate projects rose in the first quarter
as builders sought  bankruptcy protection  or debt rescheduling,
the nation’s financial regulator said.  The ratio at 18 South Korean banks stood at 18.35 percent
as of March 31, compared with 16.44 percent three months earlier,
the Financial Supervisory Service said in an e-mailed statement
today. That’s the highest ratio since the regulator began
compiling quarterly data on this category of loans in 2008.  South Korean lenders and regulators plan to form a so-
called “project finance normalization fund” that would buy as
much as 1.2 trillion won ($1.1 billion) worth of soured
construction loans from builders and developers by June to
provide liquidity to these companies and help the banking
industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
