Jet fuel  stockpiles fell to the
lowest in more than two years in  Europe ’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp oil-trading hub before the start of the peak summer
travel season, according to PJK International BV.  Supplies of the  aviation fuel  in independent storage
declined 37,000 metric tons, or 7 percent, to 491,000 tons, in
the week to today, the Oosterhout, Netherlands-based researcher
said. That’s the least since October 16, 2008.  “Because of the summer season, there is more interest from
the aviation sector” on speculation that demand will increase,
PJK founder Pieter Kulsen said by phone.  Gasoline inventories shrank 7.6 percent to 656,000 tons, a
four-week low, as buying interest also rose in anticipation of
transport demand. Cargoes of the product were exported to
 Brazil ,  Canada , Mexico and West Africa.  Stores of gasoil increased 1.6 percent to 2.93 million tons
in the week to today, according to PJK. Gasoil is a category of
products that includes diesel and heating oil. Shipments arrived
from Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the U.S.  “Demand is still slack” for heating oil, Kulsen said.
“Importers are also in a situation where they are not pressed
to replenish their stocks because end user demand is low.”  Fuel oil stockpiles grew 7.3 percent to 732,000 tons.
Naphtha supplies rose 1.7 percent to 61,000 tons.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp. Figures
in 1,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
