(Corrects time period of data in fifth paragraph.)  The  London  Metal Exchange and
 Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX)  will begin trading lead and steel
futures on the  Singapore  bourse in the third quarter, according
to Liz Milan, managing director for LME Asia.  Each dollar-denominated lead contract will represent five
metric tons of metal, while the steel contract will represent 10
tons of the alloy, compared with the benchmark 25-ton and 65-ton
contracts traded in London, Milan said in an interview in
Singapore.  The LME is expanding in Asia as growth in the region is
“structural,” Chief Executive Officer Martin Abbott said in
July. The Singapore Exchange started trading LME-SGX copper,
zinc and aluminum futures on Feb. 15 after opening an office in
Singapore last year.  “We’ve got some market makers, we’ve got active traders
but you need liquidity,” Milan said. “It’s reached the first
level and we really need to kick it on now to increase liquidity
to bring in players who are watching.”  At the end of April, 27,816 lots of copper had been traded,
according to bourse  data . This compares with 395 lots of the
LME’s own reduced-sized contracts, known as LMEminis, and 11.2
million lots for the 25-ton contract traded in the first four
months of this year.  “We’re going to make a bigger push in Singapore,  Hong Kong 
and  China  to see if we can engage them to the next level,”
Milan said on May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
