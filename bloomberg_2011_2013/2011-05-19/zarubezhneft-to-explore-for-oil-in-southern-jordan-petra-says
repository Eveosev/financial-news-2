Russia’s state-owned OAO Zarubezhneft
signed an agreement to explore for oil in southern Jordan, the
state-run news agency Petra said.  Zarubezhneft is due to survey 10,416 square kilometers
(4,022 square miles) in the Jafr area and present a technical
report on the potential for oil in the region, it said.  The kingdom, which imports 96 percent of its energy, is
seeking to attract $14 billion in investments in energy
infrastructure and has plans to develop nuclear, solar, wind and
oil shale to meet increasing electricity demand.  Jordan has signed nuclear cooperation agreements with 12
countries including Russia and has preselected possible
technologies from Russia’s ZAO Atomstroyexport, Atomic Energy of
Canada Ltd. and Paris-based Atmea, a venture of France’s  Areva
SA (CEI)  and  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)   To contact the reporter on this story:
