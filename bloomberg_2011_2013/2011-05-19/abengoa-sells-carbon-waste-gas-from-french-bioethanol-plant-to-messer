Abengoa SA (ABG) , the Spanish bioethanol
producer, agreed to sell 65,000 tons of carbon-dioxide waste gas
annually to Messer in  France  for that industrial company’s use
in making chemicals and food products, Abengoa said today in a
statement. The greenhouse gas is a byproduct from fermenting
cereal in Abengoa’s bioethanol plant in Lacq, France.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
