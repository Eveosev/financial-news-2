The  Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange 
said  Argentina ’s soybean crop won’t exceed 49.2 million tons as
the harvest nears completion.  Harvesting advanced 6.5 percentage points in the past week
and is now 85.5 percent complete, the exchange said in its e-
mailed crop report today.  Argentina’s farmers will reap less than last year’s record
55 million tons after dry weather from November to January
stressed plants in the Pampas agricultural zone. The drier
weather will allow harvesting, usually done between March and
May, to accelerate in the coming week, the exchange said.  Argentina is the world’s third-largest soybean grower
behind the U.S. and  Brazil .  The exchange maintained its corn harvest estimate at 20
million tons, and left its wheat-planting forecast unchanged at
4.95 million hectares (12.2 million acres).  To contact the reporter on this story:
