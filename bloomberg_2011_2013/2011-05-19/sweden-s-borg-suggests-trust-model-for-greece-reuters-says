Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg
suggested a trust model to help  Greece  solve its problems, he
told  Reuters  in an interview.  A trust similar to the one  Germany  used to privatize the
former East Germany’s state holdings “would be an important
step forward for Greece” as it would establish an independent
institution that would secure proceeds for a long time, the
newswire cited Borg as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
