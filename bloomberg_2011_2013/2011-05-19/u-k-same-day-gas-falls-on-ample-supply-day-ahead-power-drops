U.K. natural gas for today declined
as Scottish & Southern Energy Plc’s Aldbrough storage site
pumped the fuel and the network manager forecast ample supply.  Gas inventories in onshore underground storage sites
including Aldbrough rose to 6,662 gigawatt-hours on May 4, the
most for the time of year since at least 2004, data on Bloomberg
show. The site was pumping at a rate of about 18 million cubic
meters a day as of 4 p.m. in London, flow data show.  Same-day gas fell 0.65 pence, or 1.1 percent, to 57.65
pence a therm as of 4:30 p.m., according to broker prices
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest in two days and equal
to $9.32 a million British thermal units. A therm is 100,000
Btu. Gas for tomorrow was at 57.85 pence at the same time.  “Much of  England ,  Wales  and eastern  Scotland  will have a
generally dry day with sunny spells,” the U.K.’s Met Office
said on its website. Milder weather may cut heating demand.  National Grid forecast gas demand at 251 million cubic
meters in the 24 hours through 6 a.m. tomorrow. That’s below
normal for the time of year. Pipelines in the country will
contain 341 million cubic meters of gas at that time, 3 million
more than at the start of today.  U.K. baseload power for tomorrow dropped 25 pence to 50.15
pounds a megawatt-hour, broker data on Bloomberg show. Baseload
is delivered around the clock.  Winter gas, to be delivered in the six months from October,
gained 0.5 pence to 69.6 pence a therm. Electricity for winter
gained 45 pence to 58 pounds a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
