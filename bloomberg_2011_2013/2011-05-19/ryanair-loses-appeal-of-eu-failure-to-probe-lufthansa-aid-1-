Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ,  Europe ’s
largest discount carrier, lost a court challenge against the
European Union’s competition agency for failing to investigate a
complaint alleging  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  got illegal state aid.  Ryanair’s appeal “has become devoid of purpose” because
the European Commission eventually opened a probe into possible
aid for the German airline, the  EU General Court  in Luxembourg
ruled today. At the same time, the court rebuked the regulator
for taking too long to decide and ordered it to pay half of
Ryanair’s legal costs.  After the EU agency’s decision to start a formal probe in
July 2008, the court no longer needs to make a decision, it
said, adding that Ryanair “cannot be criticized” for trying to
“protect its rights without waiting for the commission to adopt
its decision.”  Ryanair sued the Brussels-based commission in 2007 for
failing to act upon a complaint two years earlier alleging
Lufthansa benefited from unlawful state aid through its
exclusive use of Munich airport’s Terminal 2, which was built
with 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion) of financing from the
German government and regional authorities.  The court “confirmed that the European Commission has
unreasonably delayed an investigation into state aid to
Lufthansa in connection with the development of Terminal 2 at
Munich Airport,” Ryanair said in an e-mailed statement.
“Ryanair welcomes the court’s order that the commission must
pay half of Ryanair’s legal fees, having only launched an
investigation into Lufthansa state aid after Ryanair filed its
case.”  The case is T-423/07, Ryanair v. European Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
