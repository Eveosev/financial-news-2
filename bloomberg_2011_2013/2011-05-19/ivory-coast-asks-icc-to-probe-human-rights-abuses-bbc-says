Ivory Coast President  Alassane Ouattara  requested the International Criminal Court to probe
allegations of human rights abuses committed during the
countryâ€™s recent civil war, the  British Broadcasting Corp.  said.  An estimated 3,000 people were killed during the four-month
conflict, triggered by a disputed election on Nov. 28, the BBC
reported.  More than 25,000 people are still living in the grounds if
a church in the western city of Duekoue, scared to return home
because they supported former President  Laurent Gbagbo ,
according to the BBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
