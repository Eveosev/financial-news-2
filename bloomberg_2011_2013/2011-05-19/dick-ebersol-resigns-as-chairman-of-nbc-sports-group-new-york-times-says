NBC Sports Group Chairman Dick Ebersol resigned after failing to reach a contract agreement
with  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , according to the New York Times.  Ebersol, who has run NBC Sports since 1989 and helped it
acquire the rights to more Olympics than any other network,
won’t attend negotiations next month with the International
Olympic Committee to acquire the 2014  Winter Games  in Sochi,
Russia, and the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, the  Times
reported , citing Ebersol’s comments.  Adam Freifeld, a spokesman for NBC Sports Group, didn’t
immediately return a telephone message left at his office
seeking comment.  Comcast in January completed the purchase of a majority
stake in NBCUniversal from General Electric Co., which included
the NBC Network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
