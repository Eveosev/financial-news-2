The cost of insuring government debt
rose in  Europe , according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased 2 basis points to 184. Contracts on  Greece 
climbed 19.5 basis points to 1,335, Ireland rose 13 to 633 and
Portugal jumped 15 to 632, while Italy increased 3.5 to 153 and
 Spain  was 5.5 higher at 246.5.  Corporate bond risk was little changed, with the Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings 2 basis points lower at 356. The Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings
declined 0.75 basis point to 97.25.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell 1 basis point to 139 and the
subordinated index rose 2 to 237.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
