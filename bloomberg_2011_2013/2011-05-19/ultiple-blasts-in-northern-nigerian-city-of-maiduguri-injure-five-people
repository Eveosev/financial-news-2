Multiple blasts in the northeastern
Nigerian city of Maiduguri wounded five people in an attack that
appeared to target security officials, said Lieutenant Mohammed
Abdullahi, a military spokesman.  Three policemen and two soldiers were wounded after the
explosions that went off at the Bolori police station, as well
as the Lagos Street and Pompomari areas of the city, Abdullahi
said by phone today.  Emergency workers are mobilizing help for victims, Yushau
Shuaib, a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency
said today by phone from Abuja, the capital.  In a separate incident, gunmen in the city suspected to be
Islamic militants fought with troops yesterday, leaving
“several people” wounded, Abdullahi said. He declined to give
further details.  Authorities in  Nigeria ’s north have blamed a radical
Islamic sect, Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from
 Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for a spate of bomb attacks and
killings targeting government officials and the security forces
since last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
