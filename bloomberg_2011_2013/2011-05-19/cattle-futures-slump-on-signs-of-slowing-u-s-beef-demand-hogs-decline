Cattle futures fell for a fifth
straight session, heading for the longest slide in more than a
month, as declining beef prices signaled slower demand for U.S.
meat. Hogs also dropped.  Yesterday, wholesale beef, known in the industry as the
cutout, fell 0.5 percent to $1.7739 a pound, the first decline
in four sessions, government data show. The meat has slumped 7.6
percent from the April 5 price of $1.9196, the highest since at
least January 2004, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . Cattle futures lost 2 percent in the previous four
sessions.  Prices are down after “a weak cash-cattle market
yesterday, and the beef cutout was a little bit lower,” said
 Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in  Minneapolis .  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.5 cent, or 0.5
percent, to $1.08675 a pound at 10:44 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Five days of declines would mark the
longest slide since April 12.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slid 0.95 cent,
or 0.7 percent, to $1.2705 a pound on the CME. Earlier, the
price dropped to $1.26625, the lowest since Feb. 14.  Hog futures for July settlement declined 0.325 cent, or 0.4
percent, to 91.225 cents a pound in  Chicago . Before today, the
commodity jumped 12 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
