Trading in the yuan outside  China  has
exceeded the value of $1 billion a day for the first time,
according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Deutsche Bank is opening 20 accounts in yuan a week for
companies, the bank said in statement on its website today.  China first allowed companies to conduct overseas trade in
yuan via  Hong Kong  in July 2009, Deutsche said. The bank said it
handles between 20 percent and 30 percent of the worldâ€™s
offshore yuan trade.  -- Editors: Alexander Nicholson, Ana Monteiro  To contact the reporters on this story:
