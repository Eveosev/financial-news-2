The dollar reversed declines against
the euro and the yen before data forecast to show U.S. existing
home sales grew at a slower pace.  The U.S. currency was 0.2 percent stronger at $1.4223 per
euro as of 8:45 a.m. in  London , reversing a loss of as much as
0.4 percent. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar
appreciated 0.1 percent to 81.73 from 81.51 yen earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
