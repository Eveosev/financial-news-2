The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will raise exports this month by the most
since mid-February to meet growing demand from  Asia , according
to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC, responsible for 40 percent of global supplies, will
ship 22.91 million barrels a day in the four weeks to June 4, up
1.9 percent from 22.49 million barrels a day in the period to
May 7, the consultant said today in a report. That’s the largest
increase since the period to Feb. 12. The data exclude Ecuador
and Angola. Brent crude traded at $112 a barrel in London today.  “This one is mainly being driven by a very fast recovery
in eastbound sailings,” said Roy Mason, Oil Movements’ founder,
said by phone from Halifax,  England . “Asian refiners are not
quite at peak capacity but close to it” after completing
seasonal maintenance work.  Shipments from Middle Eastern producers, including those
from non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen, will be 1.8 percent higher
at 17.56 million barrels a day in the four weeks to June 4,
according to the report. Exports from the  Persian Gulf  to Asia
will jump to 12.6 million barrels a day from 12.2 million.  Crude on board tankers will average 474.98 million barrels
in the four weeks to June 4, up 1.4 percent from 468.38 million
barrels in the period to May 7, Oil Movements said.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by keeping a tally of
tanker-rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on
board ships used as floating storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran,  Iraq ,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the group’s quota
system. The organization is next due to meet on June 8 in
Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
