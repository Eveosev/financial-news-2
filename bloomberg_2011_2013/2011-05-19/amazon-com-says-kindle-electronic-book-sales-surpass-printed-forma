Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the largest online
retailer, said sales of electronic books have overtaken those of
printed versions for the first time, a sign of the growing
dominance of its Kindle digital reader.  Amazon now sells 105 electronic books for every 100 printed
ones, the Seattle-based company said today in a statement. The
pace of U.S. book sales this year is the fastest the company has
seen in more than a decade, Amazon said.  The retailer, which got its start in 1995 as an online
bookseller, has since expanded into thousands of products,
selling everything from DVDs to baby clothes. The company’s e-
book business has been growing steadily since introducing the
Kindle in 2007. Sales of e-books surpassed hardcover titles in
July, and overtook paperbacks six months later.  “We had high hopes that this would happen eventually, but
we never imagined it would happen this quickly,”  Jeff Bezos ,
Amazon’s founder and chief executive officer, said in the
statement.  Consumers can read Amazon’s e-books on one of its four
 Kindle readers , priced from $114 to $379, as well as on
smartphones, tablets and personal computers.  Amazon may have sold more than 8 million Kindles last year,
accounting for about 5 percent of sales, according to Benchmark
Co. Amazon doesn’t disclose Kindle sales figures, other than
saying it’s the company’s best-selling product.  Amazon rose $1.72, or less than 1 percent, to $198.81 at 4
p.m. New York time in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have climbed 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
