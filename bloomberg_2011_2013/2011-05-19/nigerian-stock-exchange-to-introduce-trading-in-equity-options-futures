The  Nigerian Stock Exchange  plans to
introduce trading in securities including equity options and
futures to “deepen” the market, Chief Executive Office Oscar
Onyema said.  “A realistic time line will not be anything less than two
years for the introduction of financial options and futures,”
he told reporters today in Lagos, the commercial capital, in his
first speech since assuming office on April 4.  Nigeria’s bourse, sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest by
market value after  South Africa ’s, currently offers equities and
bonds and has “only 196 companies on its main board, of which
only 125 symbols trade daily on average,” he said. “This is
why we have placed business development on the front burner.”  The Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 4 fired
former director-general of the bourse,  Ndi Okereke-Onyiuke , as
part of measures to address “inadequate oversight of the
 exchange , ongoing litigation, allegations of financial
mismanagement, governance challenges, and the inordinate delays
in the implementation of the  succession plan ” at the bourse, it
said in a statement that day.  The exchange’s All Share Index fell for a third day, losing
0.3 percent to 25,717.73 by the 2:30 close in Lagos, according
to an e-mailed report from the bourse. This pared its increase
this year to 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
