Natural gas shipments to U.S. power
plants were set to rise for a fourth day, driven by demand in
 Oklahoma  and Louisiana on forecasts of warmer weather in the
South that may increase air-conditioner use.  A sample of scheduled gas shipments for U.S. electricity
generation rose 2.3 percent to 12.8 million dekatherms (12.5
billion cubic feet) from yesterday’s 12.5 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg as of 1:30 p.m. in New York.  Gas deliveries to Oklahoma power plants advanced 28.5
percent to 469,472 dekatherms after yesterday’s 8 percent gain.
Louisiana saw a 15 percent increase.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at the Panhandle Pool
in Oklahoma declined 3.87 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.9398 per
million British thermal units on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana , dropped 5.48
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $4.0988. The hub is the benchmark for
gas futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  MDA EarthSat Weather  in Gaithersburg, Maryland, predicted
above-normal temperatures from central Texas to Mississippi and
as far north as Wisconsin from today through May 23.  The temperature in  New Orleans  is forecast to rise from a
high today of 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius), 1 below
normal, to 88 on May 24, 2 degrees above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
