U.S. nuclear-power production rose to
the highest level in almost seven weeks as the Pilgrim 1 reactor
in  Massachusetts  and the Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in New York
started, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased 1,882 megawatts from
yesterday to 79,067 megawatts, or 78 percent of capacity, the
most since April 2, according to an NRC report today and data
compiled by Bloomberg. Twenty-two of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors
were offline.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  is operating the 685-megawatt Pilgrim 1
reactor at 38 percent of capacity after it shut May 13. The unit
unexpectedly tripped offline May 9 as it powered up following a
refueling outage that began April 18. The plant is 4 miles (6.4
kilometers) east of Plymouth.  Constellation Nuclear Energy Group LLC, a joint venture of
 Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG)  and Electricite de France SA, is
operating the 621-megawatt Nine Mile Point 1 reactor at 60
percent of capacity. The unit shut May 3 after operating at 47
percent of capacity from April 27 for repairs to the feedwater
pump system.  Another unit at the site, the 1,140-megawatt Unit 2, is
operating at full power. The plant is about 6 miles northeast of
Oswego.  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  boosted the 938-megawatt Brunswick 1
reactor in  North Carolina  to 88 percent of capacity from 31
percent yesterday after shutting it May 14. The 937-megawatt
Brunswick 2 is operating at full power.  The plant is located at Cape Fear on the Atlantic coast,
130 miles south of Raleigh.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  increased output from the 839-megawatt
Saint Lucie 2 reactor in Florida to 75 percent of capacity from
11 percent yesterday. The unit was shut May 16 after powering up
from a refueling outage. Saint Lucie 1 is operating at full
power. The plant is about 45 miles north of  Palm Beach .  NextEra boosted the 693-megawatt Turkey Point 4 Reactor in
Florida to 71 percent of capacity from 48 percent yesterday. The
reactor was shut for refueling and maintenance from March 21 to
May 2, then closed again May 6. The plant is about 20 miles
south of Miami.  Turkey Point 3 is operating at full power.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
