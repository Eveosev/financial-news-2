Tanzania’s expected good harvests and
the release of maize flour from reserves at subsidized prices
will ease inflation pressure, The Citizen newspaper reported,
citing central bank governor Benno Ndulu.  The strategy to lower food prices will slow the inflation
rate, high fuel prices not withstanding, The Dar es Salaam-based
newspaper quoted Ndulu as saying.  Government won’t reduce taxes on fuel to curb inflation 
because that will deny revenue, the newspaper reported, citing
Ndulu. The annual inflation rate in East Africa’s second biggest
economy accelerated to a 12-month high of 8.6 percent in April
from 8 percent the month before, the  National Bureau of
Statistics said May.16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
