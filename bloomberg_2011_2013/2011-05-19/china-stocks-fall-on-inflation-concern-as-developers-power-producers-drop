China’s stocks fell for the first
time in three days, led by property developers and power
producers, on concern the central bank will boost borrowing
costs and higher energy costs will hurt corporate earnings.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. led declines for developers
after the 21st Century Business Herald quoted a central bank
adviser as saying  interest rates  should be raised.  Huaneng Power
International Inc. (600011) , the listed unit of China’s largest power
group, slid 2.7 percent on concern higher coal prices will erode
earnings. Shanxi Xinghuacun Fen Wine Factory Co. advanced to a
five-month high after Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. boosted
its earnings forecast for the Chinese liquor maker.  “Inflation expectations are still there and concerns about
more tightening such as interest-rate increases will provide a
drag on the broader market,” said Wu Kan, a  fund manager  at
Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “Consumer
stocks are good hedges in this scenario.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, slid 13.20 points, or 0.5 percent, to
2,859.57 at the 3 p.m. close. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  retreated 0.6
percent to 3,120.64.  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 6.5 percent from a five-
month high on April 18 amid concern government measures to cool
inflation will slow corporate earnings growth. The central bank
has raised the reserve-requirement ratio for banks 11 times
since the start of 2010 and boosted rates four times. The drop
pared this year’s gain for the Shanghai gauge to 1.8 percent.  ‘Range’ Trade  Chinese stocks will trade in a “range” until the middle
of the year amid concerns over inflation and slowing economic
growth, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. The brokerage remains
“optimistic” on the market for the full year, saying the
economy will likely enter a “soft landing,” according to a
report by analysts including Henry Wu.  A gauge tracking 34 property companies on the Shanghai
Composite dropped 1.7 percent, the most among the five
industrial groups. Poly Real Estate, China’s second-largest
developer by market value, lost 2.1 percent to 10.11 yuan.
 Gemdale Corp. (600383)  slid 1.4 percent to 6.32 yuan.  China’s home prices rose in 67 of 70 cities monitored by
the government in April from last year, led by smaller cities
that are defying efforts to control property prices nationwide,
government data showed yesterday.  The government should raise the deposit rate to eliminate
negative real interest rates, the 21st Century Business Herald
reported today, citing central bank adviser  Li Daokui . Inflation
may be within 4 percent this year, the newspaper reported,
citing Li, who made the remarks at a forum in Shenzhen.  Inflation Rate  Inflation may exceed 6 percent in June or July due to a
lower comparison base last year, the National Business Daily
reported today, citing  Liu Yuhui , a researcher with the  Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences .  Huaneng Power, the listed unit of China’s largest power
group, slid 2.7 percent to 6.23 yuan, its lowest close since
April 29. Datang International Power Generation Co., a unit of
China’s second-biggest electricity producer, fell 2.8 percent to
7.07 yuan.  The Bohai-Rim Steam-Coal Price Index, or BSPI, rose 0.9
percent to 827 yuan ($127.2) a metric ton as of yesterday
compared with a week earlier, according to the Qinhuangdao
Seaborne Coal Market website. The weekly gauge tracks power-
station coal prices at six major Chinese ports.  China’s seasonal summer electricity shortages may worsen
this year as a surge in coal costs deepens tensions between the
nation’s power-generating companies and regulators who cap the
rates they can sell to utilities. The nation’s power shortage
may last beyond summer, said Dave Dai, a Hong Kong-based analyst
at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets.  Liquor Makers  A measure of 19 consumer staples stocks rose 0.4 percent
for the second-biggest gain among the CSI 300’s 10 groups.
Shanxi Xinghuacun Fen Wine climbed 2.4 percent to 71.69 yuan,
the highest close since Dec. 16.  The Chinese liquor maker completed 40 percent of its annual
sales target for 2011 in the first quarter and may lift the
whole-year target, Tong Xun, an analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities, wrote in a report today. The brokerage boosted
Xinghuacun Fen Wine’s earnings per-share for this year by 3.3
percent to 2.19 yuan and for 2012 by 5 percent to 3.17 yuan.  Kweichow Moutai Co.,  China ’s biggest producer of baijiu
liquor by market value, gained 2.5 percent to 199.88 yuan.
Wuliangye Yibin Co., the second largest, added 1.5 percent to
34.34 yuan.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
