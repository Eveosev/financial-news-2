A Nigerien court ordered the release
of four army officers jailed since October for allegedly
planning a coup against the former military junta, said their
lawyer, Moussa Coulibaly.  “The court ruled that it is not possible to prosecute
these soldiers,” Coulibaly told a press conference in the
capital, Niamey, today. There is “no evidence” that they were
planning a coup.  Niger’s President Mahamadou Issoufou named a 22-member
Cabinet last month after the military junta voluntary
relinquished power and organized elections earlier this year.
Parliament yesterday adopted a law granting amnesty to the
military junta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
