Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, will be smaller
than previously expected as above-average rainfall hurts yields,
research firm Datagro said.  Sugar output may fall to 34.7 million metric tons this
year, less than an April 27 estimate of 35.15 million tons,
Datagro said in a report dated yesterday.  “Producing regions had above-average rainfall for four
consecutive months,” Guilherme Nastari, a director at Barueri,
Brazil-based Datagro, said in a telephone interview today from
 New York . “Rainfall is resulting in lower crop yields and
sucrose,” the substance that is processed into sugar and
ethanol, he said.  Ethanol production will fall to 24.1 billion liters (6.36
billion gallons) this year, compared with the previous estimate
of 25 billion liters, Datagro said. Brazil is the world’s
largest sugar producer and exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
