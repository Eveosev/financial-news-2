Europe ’s natural-gas market probably
won’t “tighten” next year as a rising number of shipments of
the fuel are expected to arrive in the region, according to  GDF
Suez (GSZ)  SA Vice-Chairman Jean-Francois Cirelli.  In 2012 “there will still be a lot of supply,” he told
reporters in Berlin today. The market could change “in 2013 or
2014 according to many people but everybody has made mistakes in
forecasting in the past.”  “What we can say with more accuracy is that there will
still be a lot of room for maneuver in 2012,” said the
executive, who is also president of the Eurogas industry
association. Cirelli cited “growing” shipments of liquefied
natural gas from exporters like Qatar as one of the reasons
supply won’t diminish relative to demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
