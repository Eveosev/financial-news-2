Warmer temperatures improved the
prospects for crops in  Russia ’s Southern and North Caucasus
federal districts following rainfall in the first 10 days of
this month, the  Federal Hydrometeorological Center  said.  “The weather became warmer at last in the Southern and
North Caucasus federal districts starting from May 17,” Anna
Strashnaya, head of agro-meteorological forecasts at the Moscow-
based center, said today by phone. “Temperatures increased to
20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) from between 15 and
19 degrees. It was favorable for crops, and soil had enough
moisture.”  The rains that delayed spring sowing in the two regions
earlier this month didn’t cause damage, she said. “The
rainfalls did not have any impact. They did not last too long.
The regions will overcome the delay in sowing of late crops,”
Strashnaya said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
