Gazprom Marketing & Trading Ltd., a
unit of  Russia ’s natural gas exporter, appointed banks to
arrange a $400 million credit facility to renew existing lines.  Barclays Capital , ING Groep NV and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc began marketing the one-year revolving credit to a
wider group of lenders, they said in a statement today. Proceeds
will replace a $250 million facility that expires next month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Money in a revolving credit can be borrowed again once it’s
been repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
