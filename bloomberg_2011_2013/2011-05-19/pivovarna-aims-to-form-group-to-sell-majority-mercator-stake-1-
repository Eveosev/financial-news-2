Pivovarna Lasko Group d.d. agreed to
form a group with Slovenian banks in a bid to sell a majority
holding in  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d., the largest
supermarket chain in the Balkans.  The Slovenian company, which owns 23.3 percent of Mercator,
has given other investors, including Nova Ljubljanska Banka
d.d., until June 10 to form a group to sell more than 50 percent
of the retailer, Jure Struc, a spokesman for Lasko, said by
phone today.  “We must sell assets, and we expect the banks to reprogram
our loans,” Dusan Zorko, chief executive officer of Lasko told
broadcaster TV Slovenija today.  Pivovarna Lasko, Slovenia’s biggest brewer and beverage
company, is selling assets to repay debt of about 400 million
euros this year. The company on May 4 rejected an offer for the
Ljubljana-based Mercator from its Croatian rival Agrokor d.d.
because the competition regulator would not allow Lasko to
freely dispose of its holding, in effect blocking the sale.  Mercator fell 1.25 euros, or 0.7 percent, to close at
166.15 euros at the Ljubljana stock exchange. Lasko dropped the
most in eleven years. The stock plunged 20.5 percent to close at
7.06 euros in Ljubljana, the lowest level since February 2000.  Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  is the single largest shareholder in
Mercator, followed by Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and Nova
Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d.,  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s Slovenia unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
