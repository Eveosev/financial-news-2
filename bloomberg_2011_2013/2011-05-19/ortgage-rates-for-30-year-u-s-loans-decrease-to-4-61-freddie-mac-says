U.S.  mortgage rates  fell for a fifth
week, keeping borrowing costs at a five-month low as Americans
grow more pessimistic about a housing recovery.  The average rate for a 30-year loan slipped to 4.61 percent
in the week ended today from 4.63 percent, according to  Freddie
Mac . That is the lowest since the week ended Dec. 9. The 15-year
rate decreased to 3.80 percent from 3.82 percent a week ago, the
McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company said.  Interest rates below 5 percent have done little to energize
the U.S. real estate market, which has been weakened by tight
credit, mounting foreclosures and unemployment at 9 percent.
More than half of U.S. homeowners and renters say housing won’t
recover until at least 2014, according to a survey taken in
April by Trulia Inc. and RealtyTrac Inc. The share rose to 54
percent from 34 percent in November.  Homeowners have been taking advantage of the lowest rates
this year to reduce their monthly payments. The  Mortgage Bankers
Association ’s measure of refinancing climbed 13 percent in the
week ended May 13. Purchase applications increased 3.2 percent,
the Washington-based group said yesterday.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan is below where it
was last year at this time, when it was 4.84 percent, according
to Freddie Mac. It fell to a record low 4.17 percent in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
