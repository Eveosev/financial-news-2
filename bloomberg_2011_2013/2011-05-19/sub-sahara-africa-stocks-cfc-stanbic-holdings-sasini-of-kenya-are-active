to 60 shillings, the biggest jump since April 20. Today is the
last day shareholders can buy the stock to be entitled to
receive a dividend of 0.804 shilling a share to be paid May 25.  Sasini Ltd. (STCL)  , a Kenyan tea and coffee producer,
surged 45 cents, or 4.6 percent, to 10.35 shillings, the highest
closing price since April 15, as the shilling traded near a 17-
year low, boosting the local-currency value of the country’s
exports.  “We export 90 percent of our tea and at the current
exchange rates, it means farmers’ earnings in shilling terms
will be higher this year,” Wycliffe Masinde, a research analyst

phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
