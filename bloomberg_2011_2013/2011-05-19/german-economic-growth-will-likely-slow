The pace of Germany’s economic growth
will probably slow by mid-year after jumping 1.5 percent in the
first quarter, the  Finance Ministry  said in its monthly report.  The Munich-based Ifo institute’s German business confidence
index sank for a second consecutive month in April, reflecting
concern over energy prices. At the same time, growing domestic
industrial orders suggest that the impact of oil and gas costs
may be limited, the ministry said today.  Economic growth “may be somewhat slower during the rest of
the year,” the ministry said. While business confidence has
declined, “it remains at a high level” and unemployment, at a
19-year low last month, will continue to profit from growing
domestic demand, the ministry said.  The German economy,  Europe ’s biggest, may grow more than 3
percent for a second year as it sustains a “robust” recovery,
the  International Monetary Fund  said on May 17. Germany’s
Economy Ministry sees growth of 2.6 percent this year.  Tax revenue for the federal government and states jumped
8.9 percent in the first quarter compared with last year, led by
 sales tax , the ministry said. Federal tax revenue rose 11.2
percent over the same period. Federal and state tax revenue in
April grew 3.4 percent compared with a year ago, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
