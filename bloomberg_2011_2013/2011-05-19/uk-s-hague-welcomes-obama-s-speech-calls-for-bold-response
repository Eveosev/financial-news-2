U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
welcomed U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s speech on the Middle East
today and called for a “bold and ambitious” response to the
“historic developments of the Arab Spring,” the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office said in an e-mailed statement today.  Hague said he supports Obama’s assertion that the borders
of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines, an
endorsement of clear parameters for a two-state solution, adding
that events in the Middle East have made “progress on the peace
process more urgent than ever,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
