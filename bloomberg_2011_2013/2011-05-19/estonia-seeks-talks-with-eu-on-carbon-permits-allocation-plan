Estonia  seeks talks with the European
Union regulator to end a dispute on the Baltic country’s
national plan for allocating carbon allowances from 2008 to
2012, Environment Minister Keit Pentus said.  The European Commission, the EU regulator, last month
rejected Estonia’s revised national plan seeking annual CO2
limits of 14.36 million metric tons under the bloc’s emissions-
trading system for the five years through 2012.  “If we’d choose to take this decision to court, it would
mean the period would end before any solution could be reached
in court and this would put all the participants in the trading
scheme in a pretty difficult situation,” Pentus said today in
the capital, Tallinn. “It may also bring claims from
participants in the trading scheme against the Republic of
Estonia. We want to avoid that if at all possible.”  Estonia’s position in talks with the Commission will be
based on the average of proven emissions in 2005 through 2010,
Pentus said. Court proceedings cannot be ruled out, she said.
Estonia faces a July 11 deadline for a possible appeal.  In December 2009, the EU vetoed for a second time carbon-
dioxide emission caps proposed by Estonia and  Poland , urging the
two member states to scale back their demands for more generous
pollution limits. Estonia filed a suit against the EC in 2007
after it was awarded an annual quota of 12.7 million tons, or 52
percent of the permits requested for 2008 to 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
