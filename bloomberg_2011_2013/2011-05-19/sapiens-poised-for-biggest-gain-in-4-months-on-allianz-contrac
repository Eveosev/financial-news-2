Sapiens International Corp. N.V.
climbed the most in more than six weeks after the information-
technology company received a contract worth 1.63 million Swiss
francs ($1.8 million) from Allianz Suisse.  The shares rallied 5.4 percent, the most since April 5, to
11.95 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , bringing the
two-day gain to 7.5 percent.  U.S.-traded shares of the Rehovot, Israel-based company
climbed 7.8 percent to $3.60 yesterday after Sapiens said it
will upgrade Allianz Suisseâ€™s pension system over a 12-month
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
