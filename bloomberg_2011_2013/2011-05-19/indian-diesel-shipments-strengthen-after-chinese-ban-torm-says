Indian diesel shipments to South East
Asian countries are strengthening after  China  halted exports of
the fuel, according to Torm A/S, a European tanker company that
transports the automotive and power-generating fuel.  “ India  and also  South Korea  are looking to cover the
market to which China previously exported,” Tina Revsbech, head
of tankers at Hellerup, Denmark-based Torm, said by phone today.
“There is a huge need for energy in China during the summer
period.”  China’s National Development and Reform Commission said May
13 it would suspend diesel exports before the peak demand
period. That may strengthen the nation’s demand for the fuel,
according to Barclays Plc.  Torm said today it lost $45.3 million in the first quarter.
Demand for the company’s ships weakened. Revsbech declined to
estimate the amount demand for cargoes has gained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
