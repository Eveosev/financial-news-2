The ruble’s so-called “floating
corridor” against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket
hasn’t changed significantly since the beginning of March, said
Sergei Shvetsov, a Bank Rossii deputy chairman.  The range the central bank shepherds the ruble within
versus the basket is 32.45 to 37.45, First Deputy Chairman
 Alexei Ulyukayev  said March 1. The corridor hasn’t changed “too
much” since those comments, Shvetsov said in an interview in
Moscow yesterday.  The central banker said policy makers could widen the
corridor again in 2011 as “we usually change it no more than
twice a year,” he said. “We’ve done it once before, therefore
there’s a chance we’d do another widening in the course of the
year.”  Bank Rossii is still committed to bolstering the exchange
rate’s flexibility, Shvetsov added.  The ruble closed 0.2 percent stronger at 33.4108 versus the
basket in Moscow yesterday. The basket rate is calculated by
multiplying the dollar-ruble rate by 0.55, the euro-ruble rate
by 0.45, then adding them together.  Bank Rossii buys and sells foreign currency to keep the
ruble within the corridor, expanding the parameters of the range
once interventions top $600 million. The basket is used to limit
swings in the currency that erode the competitiveness of Russian
exporters. The corridor spanned 33 to 37 at the beginning of the
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
