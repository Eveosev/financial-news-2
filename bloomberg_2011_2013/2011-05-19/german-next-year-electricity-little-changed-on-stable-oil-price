German electricity for next-year
delivery was little changed, tracking stable crude prices.  Baseload power for 2012 rose 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
58.85 euros ($83.83) a megawatt-hour, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg as of 9:29 a.m. Berlin time. Baseload is
delivered around the clock.  Brent oil for June settlement slid 0.1 percent to $112.26 a
barrel on Londonâ€™s ICE Futures Europe exchange. Crude affects
the price of coal and gas used in  power plants  across Europe.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
Group Inc. (GFIG) , ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition Financial
Services and Tullet Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
