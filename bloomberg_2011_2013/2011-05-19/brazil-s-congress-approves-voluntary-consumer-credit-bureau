payments on time, the statement said. Senator Leonardo Quintao,
who sponsored the bill, said  interest rates  on consumer loans
may fall in the next two years, according to the statement.  The proposal goes to President  Dilma Rousseff  for her to
sign it into law, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
