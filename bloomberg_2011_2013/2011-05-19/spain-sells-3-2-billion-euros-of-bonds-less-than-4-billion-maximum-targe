Spain  sold 3.2 billion euros ($4.6
billion) of 10-year and 30-year bonds, less than the maximum
target, as demand declined.  The Treasury in Madrid said it sold 2.5 billion euros of
10-year bonds at an average yield of 5.395 percent, compared
with 5.472 percent last time the securities were auctioned on
April 20, and 5.359 percent on the secondary market yesterday.
It also sold 724 million euros of 30-year debt at an average
yield of 6.002 percent, compared with 5.875 percent at the last
auction in March.  Demand for the 10-year bonds was 1.83 times the amount
sold, compared with 2.1 last month, and the bid-to-cover ratio
for the longer-maturity debt was 1.97, compared with 2.06 in
March. The Treasury aimed to sell a maximum of 4 billion euros.
The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds in the secondary market rose
6 basis points to 5.42 percent, a three-week high.  “The total amount sold was less than we expected, but
overall it’s a reasonable auction,” said Achilleas
Georgolopoulos, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Banks
Corporate Markets. “There’s a lot of uncertainty in the market
given the latest developments on the debt crisis, but Spain
managed to sell its bonds with decent yields. It confirms the
contagion may have been contained, at least for now.”  Crisis Contagion  Spain’s Socialist government is trying to shield the euro
region’s fourth-largest economy from the sovereign-debt crisis
as expectations of a Greek debt restructuring grow. European
finance chiefs floated for the first time this week the idea of
extending  Greece ’s debt-repayment schedule as the nation
struggles to meet the terms of its 110 billion-euro rescue
package, pushing its 10-year yields to almost 16 percent.  The gap between Spanish and German 10-year borrowing costs
widened to 229 basis points today, from 224 basis points
yesterday and a euro-era record of 298 basis points on Nov. 30.
That spread compares with an average of 15 basis points in the
first decade of monetary union.  Spanish bonds handed investors a 2.34 percent gain this year
compared with a 0.7 percent loss from German securities. They
also outperformed Italian debt which gave a 2.09 percent return
during the same period, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
