U.S. banks have been disappointed in
their hopes of clearing troubled home loans from their books by
means of “short sales,” in which borrowers are given approval
to sell properties for less than the values of their mortgages,
the Financial Times reported.  An unexpectedly large number of prospective buyers are
pulling back from such transactions rather than go through a
process that can sometimes take two years to complete, the
newspaper said.  Mark Zandi , the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said
short sales have accounted for only 10 percent of home sales
this year, half of what he expected, the FT reported.  Transactions are laborious when would-be sellers have taken
out second mortgages, or when mortgages have been packaged into
securities sold to investors, the FT reported.  Banks tend to recover 20 percent more when homes are sold
short rather than sold after foreclosure, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
