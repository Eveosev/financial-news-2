Peterborough beat Milton Keynes Dons
2-0 to reach the English League One soccer finals, where it will
meet Huddersfield.  Peterborough was trailing 3-2 after the first leg of the
two-game competition, but captain Grant McCann curled in an
11th-minute free kick and Craig Mackail-Smith scored his 34th
goal of the season early in the second half to take control.  Peterborough, coached by Darren Ferguson, will go to
Manchester Unitedâ€™s Old Trafford stadium for the May 29 final.
His father,  Alex Ferguson , manages United.  Huddersfield finished in third place in the regular season,
one spot and eight points ahead of Peterborough.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
