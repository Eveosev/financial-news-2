Collateralized debt obligations
linked to commercial real estate are poised for a comeback,
according to  Fitch Ratings .  As sales of commercial-mortgage backed securities revive,
inquiries about new CDOs composed of real estate debt are
emerging, Fitch said in a report today. CDOs pool assets and
slice them into securities of varying risk.  Sales of CDOs linked to commercial real estate debt climbed
to $35 billion in 2006 from $16.1 billion in 2005, according to
Credit Suisse Group AG data. Another $35 billion was sold in
2007, the data show. Offerings plummeted after the financial
crisis. There have been no newly issued CDOs linked to
commercial property loans since 2007, according to Credit
Suisse.  “CRE CDOs backed by whole loans may look very similar to
traditional multiborrower CMBS and therefore may be able to
achieve high investment grade ratings,” Fitch analyst Huxley
Somerville said in the report.  CDOs composed of lower quality loans or securities may not
be ratable at all, he said.  Late payments on commercial property loans packaged in CDOs
climbed 0.7 basis points to 14.8 percent last month, Fitch said
in a May 13 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
