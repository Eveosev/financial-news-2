U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index higher a second straight day, as
initial jobless claims fell more than forecast and higher-than-
estimated earnings bolstered optimism.  PetSmart Inc. (PETM) , a pet-store chain, and  Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR) , a
discount retailer, added at least 7.1 percent after reporting
earnings that beat estimates.  Intel Corp. (INTC) ,  KLA-Tencor Corp. (KLAC)  and
 Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT)  slumped more than 1.5 percent as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. cut their ratings, citing increased competition
from tablet computers and excess supply.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent to 1,342.38 at 1 p.m. in  New
York . The index yesterday posted the biggest gain in three
weeks. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 33.15 points,
or 0.3 percent, to 12,593.33 today.  “The rally will accelerate,” said  Philip Orlando , the New
York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors
Inc., which oversees $358.2 billion. “We had an excellent
jobless claims number, which tells me that we’re going to see a
solid jobs report. The Fed has indicated that it will be
vigilant and watching the pace of jobs recovery. I don’t believe
we’ll see a QE3. Still, we’ll continue with easy policy.”  The S&P 500 yesterday snapped a three-day drop amid higher-
than-estimated earnings and as the  Federal Reserve  signaled
continued low  interest rates . The index rose 6.6 percent in 2011
through yesterday as profits at 72 percent of the 450 companies
that reported results since April 11 beat the average analyst
projection, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jobless Claims  Stock futures extended gains before the open of regular
trading as a government report showed that fewer Americans than
forecast filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last week,
making it more likely that the surge in April was caused by
temporary events rather than a deterioration in the labor
market.  Jobless claims declined by 29,000 to 409,000 in the week
ended May 14, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey called for a drop to 420,000. The number of
applications were the lowest in a month.  Stocks briefly turned lower after a report showed that
sales of existing homes unexpectedly declined in April,
indicating the industry is struggling to gain traction as the
economy expands. Separate figures showed that manufacturing in
the Philadelphia unexpectedly grew in May at the slowest pace in
seven months, a sign the world’s largest economy may get less of
a boost from the industry that led it out of the recession.  Earnings Season  PetSmart added 7.1 percent to $45.50. The pet-store chain
said profit in the first-quarter was 61 cents a share, exceeding
the average analyst estimate of 55 cents.  Dollar Tree  gained 3.8 percent to $63.66. The discount
retailer reported first-quarter profit of 82 cents a share. On
average, the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated earnings
of 75 cents.  Intel slumped 1.8 percent to $23.45. Goldman Sachs lowered
its rating on the world’s largest chipmaker, to “sell” from
“neutral” yesterday. The bank said its analysis shows that
processors out-shipped PCs by about 10 percent in the first
quarter. It said Intel’s longer-term threat is from tablets such
as Apple Inc.’s iPad, which run on ARM-based chips, eating into
the PC market.  Chip Orders  Goldman Sachs downgraded KLA to “sell” from “neutral,”
citing its vulnerability to weakness at Intel. Applied Materials
was cut to “neutral” from “buy” because of lower 2012
 capital spending  by chip makers. The bank said orders for
semiconductors are likely to decline in the next six quarters.  KLA dropped 4.1 percent to $41.08, while Applied Materials
slid 1.5 percent to $14.28.  LinkedIn Corp., the first major U.S. social-media company
to sell shares to the public, rallied 133 percent to $104.85 in
its trading debut. The company raised $352.8 million in an
initial public offering after pricing its shares at $45 each, at
the top end of the range. At the IPO price, the company has a
market value of $4.25 billion, or 11.3 times projected annual
sales. That compares with 13.8 for Facebook Inc. and 8.3 for
 Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
