The hard, red winter-wheat harvest in
 Texas  is 16 percent complete, and 1 percent was collected in
 Oklahoma , according to a report from Plains Grains Inc.  Isolated rainfall slowed the harvest over the weekend, the
wheat-marketing organization said today in an e-mail. Crops in
north Texas and southwest Oklahoma are “very good quality with
yields averaging in mid- to upper teens” per bushel, the group
said. Protein content of crops collected was “very good,”
according to the report.  Plains Grains, based in Stillwater, Oklahoma, is a
nonprofit group that takes wheat samples from elevators to
determine the quality of the U.S. crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
