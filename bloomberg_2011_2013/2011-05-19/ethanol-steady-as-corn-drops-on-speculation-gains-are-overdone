Ethanol was little changed in
 Chicago , holding steady with corn, which slipped for the first
day in six on speculation that this week’s gains were overdone.  Ethanol extended its streak of gains to six as corn, its
primary feedstock in the U.S., dropped 0.2 percent after gaining
4.1 percent yesterday. Ethanol has gained 6.8 percent since May
11, and corn has gained 10 percent.  “We lost a little margin yesterday, but saw a little
profit-taking in the ethanol market today,”  Jason Ward , an
analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments Inc. in Minneapolis.
“It was a pretty quiet day, but a solid session.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 0.2 cent to $2.65
a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price ranged from
$2.64 to $2.674. Prices are 65 percent higher than a year ago.  In cash market trading ethanol increased 5 cents in  New
York  to $2.755 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel surged 5.5
cents to $2.66. In the U.S. Gulf Coast ethanol increased 2.5
cents to $2.765 and was unchanged on the West Coast at $2.775 a
gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corn futures for July delivery fell 1.5 cents to settle at
$7.4825 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price has more than doubled in the past year.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa are earning 3 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are earning 5 cents on
a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
