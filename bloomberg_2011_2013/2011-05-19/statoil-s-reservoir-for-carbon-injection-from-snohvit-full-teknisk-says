The reservoir  Statoil ASA (STL)  uses to
inject carbon dioxide from the Snohvit field is full and may
explode should gas be added at the same pace, Teknisk Ukeblad
said, citing a company report and spokesman Sverre Kojedal.  Statoil plans to perforate other areas of the Tubaa
formation and drill another injection well, the magazine
reported. The company is also assessing the possibility of using
the reservoir of the shallower Stoe formation, where the gas
from Snohvit is located, for CO2 injection, it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
