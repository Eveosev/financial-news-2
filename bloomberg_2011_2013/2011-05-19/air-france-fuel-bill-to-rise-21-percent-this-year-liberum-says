Air France-KLM (AF)  Group’s fuel bill will
increase by an estimated 21 percent in the year to March 2012,
Liberum Capital Ltd. said.  Europe’s biggest airline will pay 6.9 billion euros ($9.8
billion) for jet fuel this year, Peter Hyde, head of research at
the London-based investment bank, said today in a report. That
compares with fuel costs of  5.7 billion euros  last year.  Jet fuel averaged $1,073 a metric ton since the beginning
of April compared with $791 in the previous twelve months,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A rise of $5 a barrel in  Brent crude  reduces the company’s
earnings by 160 million euros, Liberum said. Brent last traded
at about $112 a barrel on  London ’s ICE Future Europe exchange.
Jet fuel made up 39 percent of the airline’s costs last year,
compared with 36 percent a year earlier, the airline said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
