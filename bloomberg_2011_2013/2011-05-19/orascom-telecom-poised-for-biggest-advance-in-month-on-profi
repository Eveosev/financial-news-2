Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , North
Africaâ€™s biggest mobile-network operator, headed for the biggest
gain in more than a month after first-quarter profit rose
boosted by the sale of its stake in a Tunisian holding.  The shares rallied 2.6 percent to 4.28 Egyptian pounds at
11:28 a.m. in Cairo, poised for the biggest daily gain since
April 13. That gave the company a market value of 22.5 billion
pounds ($3.8 billion).  Cairo-based Orascom Telecom said profit attributable to
equity holders rose to $813 million in the first quarter from
$48.8 million a year ago. The company recognized a gain of $754
million from the 50 percent stake sale in  Orascom Telecom
Tunisia.   To contact the reporter on this story:
