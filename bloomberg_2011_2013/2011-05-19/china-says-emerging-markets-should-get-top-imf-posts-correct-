(Corrects to show Jiang was referring to top executives and
not just the managing director’s post.)  The top executives of the
International Monetary Fund should be chosen on the basis of
“impartiality” and “merit,” and developing nations should be
represented, China’s Foreign Ministry said.  IMF Managing Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  stepped down
today after he was charged with sex offences in New York. Acting
Managing Director  John Lipsky  is due to retire later this year.  The IMF should continue its process of structural reform,
Jiang Yu, a ministry spokeswoman, said at a regular briefing in
Beijing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
