Gold demand rose 11 percent in the
first quarter as  China  helped boost investment and jewelry
usage, while demand will remain “firm” throughout this year,
the  World Gold Council  said.  Global demand gained to 981.3 metric tons in the quarter,
compared with 881 tons a year earlier, the London-based industry
group said today in a report. China’s consumption surged 47
percent in the quarter and may double before 2020 as the growing
population’s wealth increases and near-term concerns about
faster inflation spur investment, the council predicts.  Accelerating inflation,  Europe ’s debt crisis, a weakening
dollar and unrest in north  Africa  and the Middle East boosted
gold to a record $1,577.57 an ounce on May 2. Central banks are
adding to their reserves for the first time in a generation,
helping prices extend a 10-year rally, the longest run of gains
in at least nine decades.  Investment “demand will remain resilient in 2011,” Eily Ong, an investment research manager at the council, said in an
interview from London yesterday. “Jewelry demand is remarkable.
We still see inflation pressures and that has driven the Chinese
investors.”  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,498.88 at 4:45
p.m. yesterday in London. Prices averaged $1,387.67 in the first
quarter, up 25 percent from a year earlier and 1.3 percent more
than the fourth quarter.  Jewelry Demand  Jewelry consumption gained 6.8 percent to 556.9 tons in the
first quarter, the council said. China’s jewelry demand surged
21 percent to a record 142.9 tons, and together with  India , the
biggest buyer, accounted for 63 percent of global purchases.  Consumers in China and India “continue to view jewelry not
just only as an adornment, but as a good investment,” Ong said.
“They see a lot of value in gold. They still have expectations
of a higher price.”  Investment increased 26 percent to 310.5 tons in the
quarter. While bar and coin purchases climbed 52 percent to
366.4 tons, holdings in exchange-traded products backed by the
metal declined. ETP assets dropped 69.9 tons from December
through March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, after
reaching a record 2,114.6 tons. Investors currently own 2,037.8
tons in the products, more than all but four central banks.  Billionaire investor  George Soros  sold 99 percent of his
bullion-backed SPDR Gold Trust assets and all 5 million shares
in the iShares Gold Trust in the first quarter, a government
filing showed this week.  John Paulson , the biggest investor in
the SPDR Gold Trust, maintained his positions.  Going Nowhere  “You have ongoing concern about the euro area and
geopolitical unrest,” Ong said. “Inflation pressure is still
an ongoing issue. These concerns are not going away.”  Central bank and government institution purchases doubled
to 129.3 tons in the first quarter, exceeding the amount bought
in the first three quarters of last year, the council said.
Countries will remain net buyers this year, it said.  Total supply declined 4.4 percent to 872.2 tons in the
first quarter from a year earlier as central banks purchased the
metal and as scrapping fell 6 percent to 347.5 tons, the council
said. Mine output rose 7 percent to 663.9 tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
