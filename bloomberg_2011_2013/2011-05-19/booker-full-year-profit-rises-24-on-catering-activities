Booker Group Plc (BOK) , the biggest U.K.
food wholesaler, said full-year profit rose 24 percent, led by
its catering activities.  Net income was 59.1 million pounds ($96 million), or 3.79
pence per share, in the fiscal year ended March 25, up from 47.6
million pounds, or 3.11 pence per share, a year earlier, the
Wellingborough, England-based company said in a statement on the
Regulatory News Service.  Last October, Booker acquired specialty foods seller
Ritter-Courivaud Ltd. and Classic Drinks Ltd. Sales to caterers
gained 6.3 percent, compared with an increase of 4.6 percent in
sales to retailers. The company is adding more fresh fruit and
vegetables, to broaden its range for independent-store
customers.  “The exceptional weather in the first seven weeks of the
current financial year has led to a good start and Booker is on
course to meet our expectations for the year,” the company said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
