Asian currencies rose, led by
Singapore’s dollar and  Malaysia ’s ringgit, as economic data
added to signs policy makers will tolerate appreciation to curb
inflation and the U.S. signaled interest rates will stay low.  The Singapore dollar climbed the most in a month after the
city-state raised its economic growth forecast for 2011, citing
a “modest” recovery in the U.S. and  Europe  and healthy
expansion in  Asia . The ringgit gained after inflation
accelerated at the fastest pace in two years, spurring
speculation policy makers will allow gains or keep raising
interest rates.  “Investors felt the Federal Reserve Board is not hurrying
to reduce liquidity in the market,” said Tetsuo Yoshikoshi, a
Singapore-based senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
“That’s a good environment for risky assets that has brought
Asian currencies higher.”  Singapore ’s dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to S$1.2393
against its U.S. counterpart as of 4:07 p.m. local time, rising
as much as 0.6 percent earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The ringgit advanced 0.2 percent to 3.0280 and  South
Korea ’s won climbed 0.2 percent to 1,086.25. The Philippine peso
rose 0.1 percent to 43.177 and Indonesia’s rupiah rallied 0.1
percent to 8,554.  The U.S. central bank may keep its monetary policy
unchanged until late this year and declining inflation
expectations have curbed the need to begin withdrawing record
stimulus, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  said in an interview yesterday.  Singapore Forecast  Singapore’s gross domestic product will increase 5 percent
to 7 percent this year, from an earlier forecast for 4 percent
to 6 percent growth, the trade ministry said in a statement
today. The economy expanded 22.5 percent in the three months
through March from the previous quarter, compared with a
preliminary estimate of 23.5 percent in April.  Kwek Mean Luck, a deputy secretary at the Ministry of Trade
and Industry, told a press conference today the strength of the
 Singapore dollar  won’t derail growth. The currency has gained
3.5 percent this year and touched S$1.2213 on May 3, the
strongest since at least 1981.  The ringgit rose for a second day after consumer prices
jumped 3.2 percent in April, the most since March 2009, the
statistics department said yesterday.  Bank Negara  Malaysia eased
more currency rules yesterday to spur investments, saying the
economy remains on a steady growth path.  “We still expect to see at least another rate hike as a
preemptive measure on inflation,” said Akira Banno, a treasury
adviser in  Kuala Lumpur  at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd.
“The market appreciates the currency measures and we should see
a sustained risk appetite this week.”  Economic Growth  Bank Negara raised its overnight rate to 3 percent from
2.75 percent on May 5, while increasing banks’ reserve ratios
for a second time this year. Policy makers next meet to review
 interest rates  on July 7.  The central bank said yesterday it will ease regulations in
the nation’s foreign-exchange market to help cut costs for
direct investments and trade financing. The measures are
effective June 1.  Malaysia’s economy grew at an annual pace of 4.6 percent
last quarter versus 4.8 percent in the final quarter of 2010,
central bank data showed yesterday. Economists in a Bloomberg
News survey had forecast a 4.9 percent increase. Growth this
year will likely be at the top end of Bank Negara’s 5 percent to
6 percent estimate, Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said.  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$28.852 against its
U.S. counterpart before a statistics bureau report today on
first-quarter gross domestic product. The island’s economy
expanded 6.2 percent from a year earlier, versus 6.92 percent in
the final quarter of 2010, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Elsewhere,  Thailand ’s baht declined 0.1 percent to 30.27
per dollar, while  China ’s yuan slipped 0.02 percent to 6.5063.
 India ’s rupee strengthened 0.1 percent to 45.025 and Vietnam’s
dong gained 0.1 percent to 20,775.  To contact the reporter on this story:
