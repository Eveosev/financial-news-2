Treasury two-year note yields fell
toward the lowest level since March as weakness in regional
manufacturing and housing reinforced speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will hold borrowing costs down.  Benchmark 10-year note yields erased gains as New York Fed
President  William Dudley  said the central bank is falling short
of its goals because of the modest pace of the recovery, with
unemployment too high and headline inflation likely to ease. The
government’s $11 billion sale of 10-year inflation-indexed debt
drew a lower yield than forecast.  “The front-end strength is leading the market today as the
economic data continue to underwhelm,” said Scott Graham, head
of government bond trading at Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital
Markets unit in  Chicago . “People are looking at the Fed, and
the headwinds to growth continue to argue for them keeping rates
lower for a longer period. We are at this level for a reason.”  Two-year note yields dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 0.52 percent at 5:06 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 0.625 percent
security due in April 2013 gained 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000
face amount, to 100 6/32. The yield touched 0.51 percent on May
17, the lowest level since March 15.  The yield on the 10-year note fell one basis point to 3.17
percent after touching 3.24 percent, the highest level since May
12. While the yield dropped to the five-month low of 3.09
percent yesterday, it failed to break its 200-day moving average
of 3.08 percent.  TIPS Auction  Today’s auction of 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities produced a yield of 0.887 percent, compared with the
average forecast of 0.890 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
nine of the Fed’s 20 primary dealers.  Investors bid for 2.66 times the amount of debt offered,
compared with 2.97 at the previous offering on March 24 and the
average of 2.79 for the past 10 sales. Indirect bidders, a class
that includes foreign central banks, bought 40.7 percent,
compared with the 10-sale average of 41.7 percent.  “The auction was slightly better than average considering
the big size and all of the volatility in the markets right now
with oil,” said Sergey Bondarchuk, an interest-rate strategist
in New York at BNP Paribas SA, which as a primary dealer is
obliged to participate in U.S. auctions. “It wasn’t as strong
as recent auctions, and the bid-to-cover wasn’t the best, but it
came through.”  Crude oil for June delivery fell 1.6 percent to $98.49 a
barrel. Prices have risen 42 percent in the past year. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2 percent.  Break-Even Rate  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and
comparable TIPS, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer
prices over the life of the debt known as the break-even rate,
decreased to 2.31 percentage points after touching 2.26
percentage points yesterday, the narrowest since Feb. 17.  TIPS are intended to provide a hedge against rising
consumer prices. The securities rise or fall in value tracking
changes in the  consumer price index  calculated by the Labor
Department. Inflation adjustments will be added to the notes’
principal and be payable at maturity.  The consumer price index increased 3.2 percent in the 12
months ended in April, figures from the Labor Department showed
this month, while the measure excluding food and energy rose 1.3
percent from April 2010.  The government will sell $35 billion of two-year notes, the
same amount of five-year notes and $29 billion of seven-year
notes next week in three daily consecutive sales starting May
24, the government announced today. The sizes are unchanged from
the previous sales.  Slower Manufacturing  Treasury two-year note yields dropped as manufacturing in
the Philadelphia area expanded at the slowest pace in seven
months and sales of existing homes unexpectedly fell.  The Philadelphia Fed’s factory index slid to 3.9 this month
from 18.5 in April. Readings greater than zero signal expansion.
Existing home sales fell 0.8 percent in April after a 3.5
percent increase in the previous month, the National Association
of Realtors reported.  “Low rates and compressed range trading since the end of
last week erupted this morning into gale force volume on a
series of minor data points,” wrote  Jim Vogel , head of agency-
debt research at FTN in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , in a research note
e-mailed to clients. “Volume on Philly Fed et al at 10:00 a.m.
EDT rivaled the first 15 minutes after an NFP release,” wrote
Vogel, referring to the Labor Department’s monthly nonfarm
payrolls report.  Fed Exit Strategy  Treasury 10-year yields rose yesterday the most in six
weeks after minutes of the central bank’s April meeting showed
officials discussed an exit strategy for record stimulus.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told reporters after the
session last month that he was unsure when stimulus would end
after a $600 billion program of debt buying stops in June. The
central bank bought $1.92 billion of Treasuries due from August
2021 to November 2027 today to support the economy.  Policy makers probably won’t raise borrowing costs until
2013, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., a primary dealer, said in a
report yesterday. The target rate for overnight lending between
banks has stayed at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  Fed funds futures indicate a 33 percent chance that the
central bank will increase the target lending rate at its March
2012 meeting, compared with 35 percent odds a week ago.  The central bank has “a considerable way to go” before it
meets its dual mandate of full employment and price stability,
Dudley said today in New Paltz, New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
