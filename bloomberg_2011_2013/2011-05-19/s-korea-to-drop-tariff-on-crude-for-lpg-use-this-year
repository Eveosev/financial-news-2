South Korea  will drop its tariff on
crude oil used to make liquefied petroleum gas through the end
of this year, the finance ministry said.  The 2 percent tariff on such imports will be dropped
starting the end of this month to stabilize the local cost of
heating fuel for low-income residents, the  ministry  said in an
e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
