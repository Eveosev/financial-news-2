Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) ’s 8.875 percent
hybrids fell for a second day to the lowest since June after
Ohio’s largest lender said it would redeem the trust preferred
securities below market value.  The $400 million of securities fell 0.05 cent to $25.15
after dropping $1.48 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Fifth Third submitted redemption requests to the trustee to
redeem the notes at $25 with an additional payment for accrued
and unpaid distributions, the Cincinatti-based bank said in a
statement yesterday. The Federal Reserve Board didn’t object to
the potential redemption, the company said.  “Fifth Third definitely caught the market by surprise,”
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts Kabir Caprihan and Mathew Hughart,
wrote in a note today. “All premium hybrids dropped in value
following the announcement,” the New York-based analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
