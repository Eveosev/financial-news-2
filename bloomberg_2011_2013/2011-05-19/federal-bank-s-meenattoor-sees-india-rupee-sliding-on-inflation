Scaria Meenattoor, chief manager of
the foreign-exchange desk at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai,
comments on the outlook for  India ’s rupee.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency
gained 0.3 percent to 45.64 per dollar as of 9:10 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will fall 1.5 percent from the spot rate of
44.9625.  “The chances are the rupee will weaken to around the 46
per dollar level in three months. The pressure is on the
inflation side and the increase in  interest rates  by the central
bank is also hurting sentiment.  “The inflation rate is expected to increase as fuel prices
are likely to go up further. The stocks are expected to come
down by 1 percent because of the outlook for the economy.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
