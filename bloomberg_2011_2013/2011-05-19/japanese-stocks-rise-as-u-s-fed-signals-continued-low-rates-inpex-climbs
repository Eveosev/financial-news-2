Japanese stocks fell after a report
showed the nation’s economy shrank more than estimated in the
first quarter and utilities dropped after the Prime Minister
said  Japan  will debate overhauling the energy industry.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest bank
by market value, declined 2.1 percent.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.,
the operator of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant
damaged in the record earthquake in March, tumbled 8 percent.
Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co., a chip equipment maker,
plunged 5.3 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
rating on chipmaker  Intel Corp. (INTC)   The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average declined 0.4 percent to
9,620.82 at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The broader
Topix index dropped 0.7 percent to 831.89 with about three times
as many stocks retreating as advancing.  “It was hard to speculate how the impact of the disaster
would affect gross domestic product, but the stock market
reacted to the figures that fell short of the estimate in the
market,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee about $18
billion as chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co. in
Tokyo.  Japan’s economy contracted an annualized 3.7 percent in the
three months ended March 31, the Cabinet Office said today in
Tokyo. The median forecast of 23 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a 1.9 percent drop.  Banks Retreat  Banks were the heaviest drag on the Topix. Mitsubishi UFJ
lost 2.1 percent to 378 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-largest bank, sank 2.1 percent to 2,413 yen.
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , the No. 3, dropped 1.5 percent to
129 yen.  The Topix has lost 11 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, disabled a nuclear power plant and disrupted
supply chains at companies. Shares in the gauge traded at 14.7
times book value.  Utility companies had the largest drop among the 33
industry groups in the Topix after Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said
Japan will debate an overhaul of the nation’s energy industry,
in which companies currently hold regional monopolies and are in
charge of both power generation and distribution networks.  Energy Industry  Overhaul  Tokyo Electric Power tumbled 8 percent to 358 yen. Chubu
Electric Power Co., which shut a nuclear plant last week,
plunged 5.1 percent to 1,282 yen, a level not seen since May
1985. Kansai Electric Power Co. retreated 4.4 percent to 1,399
yen, also the lowest since May 1985.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , the world’s No. 1 maker of
microcontrollers used in cars and mobile phones, fell 3.9
percent to 715 yen. The company, whose production was disrupted
by the earthquake, said its net loss in the year ended March 31
swelled to 115 billion yen ($1.4 billion) from 56.4 billion yen
a year earlier.  Chip-equipment makers dropped after Goldman Sachs lowered
its rating on Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, to “sell”
from “neutral,” citing slowing processor shipments and
increased competition from ARM-based processors in tablets and
eventually in mainstream PCs.  Dainippon Screen Manufacturing slumped 5.3 percent to 676
yen, the second-largest drop on the Nikkei.  Advantest Corp. (6857)  lost
3.4 percent to 1,481 yen. Ibiden Co. sank 3.1 percent to 2,640
yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
