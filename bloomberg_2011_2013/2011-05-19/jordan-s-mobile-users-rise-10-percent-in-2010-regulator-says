Jordan’s mobile-phone subscriptions
rose 10 percent to 6.6 million in 2010, the country’s
Telecommunications Regulatory Commission said.  Subscriber numbers have increased progressively over the
past five years, with 6.014 million in 2009, 5.3 million in
2008, 4.7 million in 2007, 4.3 million in 2006 and 3.1 million
in 2005, the commission said on its  website . Market penetration
rose to 108 percent in 2010 from 57 percent in 2005, according
to the commission.  Zain, the Jordanian unit of  Kuwait ’s Mobile
Telecommunications Co., had 36.3 percent of the market in 2010
with 2.4 million subscribers,  Jordan Telecom (JTEL)  Corp. 31.8 percent
with 2.1 million, and  Umniah , a Jordanian unit of Bahrain
Telecommunications Co. known as Batelco, has 30.3 percent with 2
million subscribers, it said.  “The rise in mobile subscribers is due to the strong
competition in prices between mobile operators,” Abed Shamlawi,
chief executive officer of the Information Technology
Association of Jordan, said in a telephone interview from Amman.  The number of fixed-line subscribers dropped to 485,000 at
the end of 2010 from 628,000 in 2005. Market penetration dropped
from 11.6 percent in 2005 to 8 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
