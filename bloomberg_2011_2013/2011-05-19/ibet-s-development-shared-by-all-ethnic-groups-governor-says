China  rejected claims by Tibetans
that ethnic Han Chinese settlers have disproportionately
benefitted from a more-than 100-fold growth of the economy since
it took over the mountainous region in 1951.  The economic development of  Tibet  is shared by people from
all ethnic groups, with Tibetans making up about 90 percent of
the population, Padma Choling,  governor  of China’s Tibet
Autonomous Region, said in Beijing today.  “There’s no such thing as the Han ethnic people enjoying
most of the economic development,” he said at a press
conference marking the 50 year anniversary of Chinese rule.  Tibet’s gross domestic production reached 50.7 billion yuan
($7.8 billion) in 2010, 111.8 times more than half a century ago,
Padma Choling said. Spiritual leader the  Dalai Lama  fled into
exile eight years after Chinese troops took over the capital of
Lhasa, and Tibetan groups have since accused the government of
discrimination against indigenous people and exploitation of the
region’s resources.  The Han is an ethnic group in China constituting the
majority of the country’s population. Anti-Chinese riots in
Tibet in 2008 were the largest in almost two decades. China says
at least 19 people died in the unrest. Tibet’s government-in-
exile said more than 200 Tibetans were killed in the ensuing
crackdown.  --Yidi Zhao. Editors: Ben Richardson,  Mark Williams   To contact the reporter on this story:
