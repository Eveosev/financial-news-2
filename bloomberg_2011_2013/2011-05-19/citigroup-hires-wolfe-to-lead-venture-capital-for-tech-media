Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets, hired Trip Wolfe to head  venture capital 
coverage for  North America  in the technology, media and
telecommunications group.  Wolfe is taking a newly created position at the New York-
based bank after working at Union Square Advisors LLC, where he
managed venture capital and private equity sponsor coverage,
according to a memo to Citigroup employees obtained by Bloomberg
News.  Citigroup added Union Square co-founder Ethan Topper in
April to head global technology banking. The appointments follow
last year’s departure of Michael Tedesco, who left Citigroup as
head of technology mergers and acquisitions to join  Jefferies
Group Inc. (JEF)  as head of U.S. M&A and technology deal-making.  “This is a new role within Citi to help build stronger
relationships within the venture capital and related sponsor
communities,” Ben Druskin and Mark Shafir, global co-heads of
technology, media and telecommunications banking, said today in
the memo.  Before joining Union Square, Wolfe led the global
technology, media, telecommunications and business services
equity capital markets team at Charlotte, North Carolina-based
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , according to the memo. He also was head
of equity origination at Jefferies and oversaw technology, media
and telecommunications equity capital markets at  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) , based in Frankfurt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
