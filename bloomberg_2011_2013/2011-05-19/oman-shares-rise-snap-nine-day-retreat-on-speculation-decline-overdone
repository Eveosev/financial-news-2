Oman shares advanced the most in more
than two weeks, rising for the first time in 10 days, on bets a
drop prompted by lower first-quarter earnings was overdone.  Renaissance Services SAOG (RNSS) , an Omani provider of services to
the oil and gas industry, climbed as much as 0.8 percent.  Oman
Telecommunications Co. (OTEL) , the Persian Gulf country’s biggest
telephone company, gained the most in more than a week. The
 MSM30 Index (MSM30)  rose 0.3 percent to 6,048.33, the most since May 2,
at the 1 p.m. close in Muscat, trimming its drop for the week to
1.8 percent. Kuwait’s measure lost 0.2 percent and Dubai’s  DFM
General Index (DFMGI)  fell 0.4 percent.  “Institutional buying interest is seen at the current
lower levels,” said Kanaga Sundar, senior manager of research
at Gulf Baader Capital Markets SAOC in Muscat. The market had
dropped “in the negative zone on lower volumes with the added
impact of disappointing first-quarter earnings of some index
heavyweights.”  Oman’s gauge, down 10 percent so far this year, is valued
at about 1.7 times net assets, or book value, while  Saudi
Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  is valued at 2 times net assets
and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index at 1.9.  Renaissance, the company with the fourth-heaviest weighting
on Oman’s index, last week said first-quarter profit tumbled to
935,000 rials ($2.4 million) from 4.69 million rials the year-
earlier. The shares advanced as high as 0.945 rial today before
closing at 0.941 rial.  Quarterly Profit  Omantel, which also said first-quarter profit dropped last
week, rose 0.3 percent, the most since May 11, to 1.093 rials.
Net income fell 20 percent to 26 million rials as operating
expenses increased. The company has the second-biggest weighting
on Oman’s index.  In Dubai,  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , builder of the world’s
tallest skyscraper, lost 0.9 percent to 3.17 dirhams after the
company said it will write off its investments in Dubai Bank
PJSC in the second quarter of this year.  Dubai Bank, an Islamic lender 70 percent owned by Dubai
Holding LLC and 30 percent by Emaar, was rescued by the Dubai
government after loan losses mounted as the emirate grappled
with a debt crisis.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  was little changed. In the
 United Arab Emirates ,  Abu Dhabi ’s measure slipped 0.2 percent.
Bahrain’s benchmark dropped 0.3 percent, while Qatar’s index
gained 0.2 percent. Saudi Arabia’s market was closed for the
weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
