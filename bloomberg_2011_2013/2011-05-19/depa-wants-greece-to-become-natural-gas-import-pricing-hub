Depa SA ,  Greece ’s public gas company,
plans to make the country a natural gas transmission corridor
and import gateway into south-east Europe for liquefied natural
gas, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Spiros Paleoyannis said.  “Our vision is to make our country a transmission corridor
for natural gas from  Russia , the  Caspian Sea  and the Middle
East” as well as “a new gateway for LNG from various sources
for south-east Europe and the Balkans,” Paleoyannis said today
at a conference, according to an e-mailed copy of his speech
from Athens-based Depa.  As part of these plans, “we hope to make Greece a new
benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the region, or a
regional gas pricing hub,” he said. Three international
pipelines being built to carry gas to  Europe  will cross Greek
territory.  Depa intends to build an LNG regasification plant in
northern Greece, either on land or at sea, which will be mainly
used for exporting gas to other countries in south-east Europe,
he said.  LNG is gas that has been cooled to liquid form for
transporting by ship, and which is then reconverted to its
gaseous state when needed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
