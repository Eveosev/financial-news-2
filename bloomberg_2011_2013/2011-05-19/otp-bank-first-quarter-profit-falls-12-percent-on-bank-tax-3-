OTP Bank Nyrt., the biggest
independent lender in  Europe ’s emerging markets, said first-
quarter net income declined 12 percent because of a special bank
tax.  Profit fell to 37.2 billion forint ($198 million), from
42.4 billion forint a year earlier, OTP said in a statement to
the Budapest Stock Exchange today. The mean forecast of 12
analysts in a Bloomberg survey was 36.2 billion forint.  The results “are around the levels we’ve planned” for
this year, Chief Financial Officer Laszlo Bencsik said at a
press conference in Budapest. “We’re satisfied with the
numbers.” Final results for 2011 hinge on risk-cost and margin
developments, he said.  Excluding the bank tax, net income rose 4 percent to 44.1
billion forint, as OTP  units  in central Europe boosted profit,
led by subsidiaries in Russia and  Bulgaria . The profit
contribution of foreign subsidiaries rose to 25 percent.  The bank didn’t give a profit forecast for 2011, citing
uncertainty in the economic environment.  OTP, which has subsidiaries in nine countries in central
and eastern Europe, saw profit suffer as the economic crisis
pushed most economies in the region into recession, increasing
the percentage of non-performing loans. OTP’s bad loans rose by
72 billion forint from the previous three months, reaching 15
percent of total credit at the end of the quarter, up from 13.7
percent at the end of 2010  Fees, Commissions  Net-interest income, the difference between what OTP pays
on deposits and charges for loans, rose 6 percent to 151.7
billion forint. Fees and commissions climbed 5 percent to 32.7
billion forint.  Bencsik expects the increase in bad loans to slow in 2011.  Analysts at local brokerage Equilor said in a research note
today that the “main risk factor for OTP is a potential
negative turn in global sentiment, which could dampen economic
growth and boost provisioning and risk costs.”  OTP fell for a fourth day and closed 1.2 percent lower at
6,025 forint in Budapest. OTP shares have gained 20 percent this
year, compared with a 9.5 percent decline by Austrian peer
Raiffeisen Bank International AG and outperformed the Hungarian
benchmark BUX index, which rose 7.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
