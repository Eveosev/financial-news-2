European coal derivatives retreated
in  London  trading.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year declined 60 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$126.15 a metric ton by 11:57 a.m. in London. They have shed 1.6
percent this week.  Profit from running coal-fired power plants for next month,
the so-called clean-dark spread, is about 6.41 euros ($9.02) a
megawatt-hour, compared with 1.98 euros from burning natural
gas, Bloomberg data showed. The calculation uses electricity
prices in  Germany  and takes emission costs into account.  December carbon-dioxide permits under the European Union
cap-and-trade system fell 1.1 percent to 16.18 euros. Gas for
delivery in the six months through September 2012 to the U.K.,
Europeâ€™s biggest consumer of the fuel, was little changed at
63.25 pence ($1.03) a therm in London.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information
