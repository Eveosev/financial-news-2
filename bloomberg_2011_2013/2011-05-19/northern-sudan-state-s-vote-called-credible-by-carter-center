Voting in the northern Sudanese state
of Southern Kordofan was “generally peaceful and credible,”
though there were some “irregularities” and “heightened
insecurity,” said the Atlanta-based  Carter Center .  “In spite of the procedural lapses, the  Carter Center  did
not observe systemic irregularities that would invalidate the
results,” the organization, founded by former U.S. President
 Jimmy Carter  and his wife, Rosalynn, said in an e-mailed
statement received today. The center monitored the May 2-4 vote.  Voters retained incumbent state Governor Ahmen Haroun, who
is wanted by the  International Criminal Court  in connection with
war crimes in Darfur, a region in the west of northern Sudan.  Southern Kordofan was the scene of heavy fighting during
the two-decade civil war between the northern and southern
regions that ended with a  peace agreement  in 2005. The state,
which is northern Sudan’s only oil-producing region, is located
on the border with the south.  The northern branch of the  Sudan  People’s Liberation
Movement,  Southern Sudan ’s ruling party, said it won’t recognize
the results of the election because of alleged vote-rigging. The
party led the rebellion against the Sudanese government in
Khartoum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
