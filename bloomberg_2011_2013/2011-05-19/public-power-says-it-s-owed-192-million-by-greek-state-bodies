Public Power Corp. SA,  Greece ’s
biggest electricity producer, said it’s owed a total of 134.8
million euros ($192 million) by the central government and other
public bodies.  The  Ministry of Infrastructure, Transport and Networks  has
built up a debt of 46.6 million euros since 1998 for traffic
lights in the Athens metropolitan area, and municipal water and
sewerage services throughout Greece have 20.9 million euros of
unpaid bills, some of which date back to 2005, Public Power said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Attiko Metro Operation Company SA , which runs the Athens
underground metro train system, and the Greek police
headquarters each owe 6.7 million euros from early last year,
according to the statement.  The government said on April 15 that it will reduce its
holding in  Public Power  next year to 34 percent from 51 percent,
as part of a plan to raise 50 billion euros from sales of state
assets by 2015 to reduce debt.  For Related News and Information:
