Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  is buying
other African crudes and oil from the Middle East to replace
lost Libyan grades, according to B.R. Mehta, senior vice
president at the company.  Reliance’s current refining margins are at $8 a barrel
compared with $7 a barrel last year, Mehta said today in an
interview at the Global Refining Summit in Rotterdam.  The Mumbai-based company operates the world’s largest
refining complex at its Jamnagar facility. They have a
processing capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day and account
for about 1.6 percent of global capacity, according to the
Reliance’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
