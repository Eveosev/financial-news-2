Israel ’s 10-year government bond fell
for the first time in six days on speculation the  Bank of Israel 
may slow the pace of interest rate increases after April
inflation came in below economists’ expectations.  Central bank Governor Stanley Fischer will leave the
benchmark interest rate unchanged at 3 percent on May 23,
according to nine of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
remaining 10 predict the rate will rise by a quarter-percentage
point to 3.25 percent. Fischer has been increasing the rate
gradually from a record low of 0.5 percent in August 2009 as the
economy, led by exports, recovers from the global recession
faster than many other advanced countries  “It’s a 50-50 call right now so investors are taking
profits before the rate decision next week,” Assaf Rosenberg, a
trader at Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd. in  Ramat Gan ,
Israel, said today by telephone. “Still, the trend is still for
higher rates in the coming months as the economy is expected to
continue to grow.”  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 fell,
pushing the yield up three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 5.12 percent at 12:11 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The bond has
gained 1.6 percent this month. The shekel rose for a second day,
strengthening 0.3 percent to 3.5119 per dollar.  Consumer prices are expected to rise 3.1 percent in the
next 12 months, according to the average of forecasters in a
survey, the Bank of Israel said yesterday. Annual inflation
slowed to 4 percent in April from 4.3 percent in March, the
 Central Bureau of Statistics  said May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
