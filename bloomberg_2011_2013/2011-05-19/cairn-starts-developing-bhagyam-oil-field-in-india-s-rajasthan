Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , which  Vedanta
Resources Plc (VED)  proposes to buy, has started developing the
Bhagyam oil field in the western state of Rajasthan, the U.K.-
based parent company said.  Production from Bhagyam is expected to start in the second
half of 2011 and may reach 40,000 barrels a day by the end of
the year,  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  said in a statement today. Thirty
wells have been drilled in the field.  Construction of the fourth unit at the Mangala crude
processing plant has started and is expected to be ready in the
second half of this year, Cairn Energy said. Gross revenue from
the Mangala field exceeded $3 billion, Cairn Energy said,
without giving a timeframe.  Cairn  India  will start exploration drilling in a block in
Sri Lanka in August, according to the statement.  The sale of a 40 percent stake in Cairn India by the parent
is awaiting the Indian government’s approval, Cairn Energy said.
The company said it agreed with Vedanta to extend the closing
date of the sale and purchase agreement in order to secure the
approvals to complete the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
