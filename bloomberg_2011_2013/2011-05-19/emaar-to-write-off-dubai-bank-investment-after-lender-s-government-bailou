     May 19 (Bloomberg) --  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the  United
Arab Emirates ’ biggest developer by market value, said it will
write off its investments in Dubai Bank PJSC in the second
quarter of this year.  The value of Emaar’s investment in Dubai Bank was about 172
million dirhams at the end of March, or about 0.3 percent of
Emaar’s total assets and 0.56 percent of its total equity, the
company said in a  statement  to the Dubai bourse today.  Dubai Bank, an Islamic lender owned by Dubai Holding LLC
and Emaar, was rescued by the Dubai government after loan losses
mounted as the emirate grappled with a debt crisis. Dubai
Holding held a 70 percent stake in the bank, while Emaar owned
30 percent. The takeover will “effectively dilute the complete
holding” of Dubai Holding and Emaar, Dubai’s government said on
May 16.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
