NetEase.com (NTES)  Inc., China’s second-
biggest online games operator, rose the most in almost two
months after its first-quarter profit beat analysts’ forecasts.  The company’s American depositary receipts climbed 1.9
percent to $46.82 at 10:24 a.m. in  New York . They gained as much
as 4.7 percent earlier, the biggest intraday gain since March
21. First-quarter net income jumped 63 percent to 737.4 million
yuan ($112.6 million) from a year earlier, NetEase said in a
statement yesterday. That beat the 619.6 million-yuan average
estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
