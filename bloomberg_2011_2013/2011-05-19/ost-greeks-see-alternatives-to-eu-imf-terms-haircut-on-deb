More than two thirds of Greeks say
there are alternatives to the European Union-led bailout package
agreed on last year to exit the country’s economic crisis, a
poll from  Skai media  group and  Kathimerini  newspaper shows.  Sixty-nine percent of those questioned said the memorandum
of terms agreed on for the EU and International Monetary Fund
loans isn’t the only way to deal with the crisis, the poll
conducted by Public Issue showed. One quarter said it was the
only option, down from one third last month, according to the
poll. About 62 percent said the bailout deal has hurt the
country.  Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s government has slashed
wages and pensions and raised taxes to bring down the deficit,
which reached 15.4 percent of gross domestic product last year.
In May 2010 Greece agreed to austerity measures in exchange for
a 110 billion-euro ($156.8 billion) bailout from the EU and IMF.  Over half of those polled said a debt restructuring
including losses for investors, or a haircut, is the best way to
face the debt, with 17 percent saying implementation of the
memorandum and repayment of the total debt is the right way and
another 17 percent saying  Greece  should halt payments.  Greece’s government aims to raise 50 billion euros from
state-asset sales and real-estate development through 2015 to
help pay down its debt. That debt is likely to reach 166 percent
of gross domestic product in 2012, according to European
Commission estimates released on May 13.  Sixty-four percent said Greece is likely to default, up
eight percentage points from a November poll. About 32 percent
said a default is unlikely, compared with 39 percent of
respondents in November. It will take over 20 years to tackle
the debt problem, 40 percent of respondents said.  The survey had a 4.5 percentage point margin of error with
502 people polled between May 2 and May 10 and 521 polled
between May 10 and May 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
