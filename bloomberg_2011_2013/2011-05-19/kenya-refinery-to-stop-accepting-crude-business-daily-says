Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd., the
fuel processor owned by  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  and the Kenyan
government, said the Mombasa refinery will stop taking crude for
refining starting in July, Business Daily reported, citing the
Kenya Ministry of Energy.  The move is part of the governmentâ€™s shift toward importing
refined fuel to address frequent shortages, according to the
Nairobi-based newspaper. KPRL now holds 154,000 metric tons of
oil, which is expected last for a month, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
