Sweden  promised to bring its laws on
 capital requirements  for banks into compliance with European
Union law after the EU’s executive arm told the government to
make the changes within two months or face a lawsuit.  The new rules “are meant to come into force on June 30,”
Victoria Ericsson, a spokeswoman for Sweden’s  Finance Ministry ,
said by telephone in  Stockholm  today. “In the wake of the
financial crisis, there has been a need for comprehensive
regulatory work both on a global and EU level and these things
take a bit of time to implement.”  The European Commission said 10 member states, including
Sweden, had failed to “fully” put in place rules on increasing
the capital reserves that lenders must hold against potential
losses. If the measures aren’t implemented within two months,
the commission may take offenders to the  European Court  of
Justice.  The Swedish government and central bank are pushing for
stricter requirements than those proposed by the Basel III
global capital framework that’s being worked out following the
global financial crisis.  Banks should prepare for a one percentage point increase in
capital requirements every year “over the next few years,”
Finance Minister Anders Borg said in March. The government is
due to present a detailed proposal on banking regulations by the
end of the year or early in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
