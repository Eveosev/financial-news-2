WestLB AG, the German state-owned
bank that’s seeking European Commission approval for a bailout,
shelved plans to find a buyer for the whole lender and said it’s
preparing to sell assets instead.  WestLB will focus on shrinking into a Verbundbank, a
regionally focused lender that serves savings banks, “and a
sale of the bank as a whole has taken a backseat,” the
Dusseldorf-based firm said in a  statement  today. Morgan Stanley
continues to advise on the restructuring process, it said.  The bank, which provides lending, structured and real-
estate finance, capital markets and transaction services, was
bailed out by its owners and  Germany ’s Soffin rescue fund after
running up losses during the financial crisis. The European
Commission must accept WestLB’s restructuring plans to grant
approval for the state aid. A refined concept on the Verbundbank
option is due to be submitted by June 30.  The commission has expressed its preference for that model
and the bank is now working out the precise details and
implementation, WestLB said in today’s statement. The lender may
need additional guarantees from its owners, which include
regional savings banks and the state of North-Rhine Westphalia,
to enable the restructuring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
