Gold declined in  New York  on
speculation that slowing inflation will curb demand for the
metal as a hedge against rising consumer prices.  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard 
said in an interview in New York that the central bank may keep
its monetary policy unchanged until late this year, and that
declining inflation expectations have lessened the need to begin
withdrawing record stimulus. Gold futures have dropped 5.4
percent from a record $1,577.40 an ounce on May 2.  “Inflation expectations have been easing,” said  Dan Smith , an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc in  London . “Gold is
looking for another reason to break higher. It lacks a
trigger.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell $3.40, or 0.2 percent,
to settle at $1,492.40 at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New York.  The difference between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of traders’
expectations for inflation, has dropped from as high as 2.67
percentage points on April 11 to 2.36 percentage points today.  Crude oil dropped below $100 a barrel in New York today.
Oil futures reached $114.83 on May 2, the highest in more than
two years.  “Gold is moving in tandem with oil and the risk-on-risk-
off commodity trade,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading LLC in Chicago.  China Jewelry Demand  Gold demand gained 11 percent to 981.3 metric tons in the
first quarter from a year earlier, the World Gold Council said
today. Jewelry usage in China, the biggest buyer after India,
climbed 21 percent to a record in the quarter, and the country’s
consumption of the metal may double before 2020, the London-
based industry group said.  Silver futures for July delivery fell 16.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $34.932 an ounce on the Comex. Palladium futures for
June delivery fell $9.05, or 1.2 percent, to $728.15 an ounce on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Platinum futures for July
delivery fell $10.90, or 0.6 percent, to $1,769 an ounce on the
