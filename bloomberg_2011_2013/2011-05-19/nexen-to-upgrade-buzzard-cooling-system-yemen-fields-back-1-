Nexen Inc. (NXY)  said it will complete
repairs to the cooling system at its Buzzard oil project in the
U.K.’s  North Sea  by the end of this month.  Rates at Buzzard will be limited to the equivalent of about
80,000 barrels of oil daily until the work is completed,
Calgary-based Nexen said in a statement. Production will be
ramped up to full capacity of 200,000 barrels a day by the end
of July. A two-week turnaround at Buzzard scheduled for
September has been realigned because of the cooling work.  The company said its 2011 output would be at the low end of
the guidance issued in November. The company had forecast output
would average 230,000 to 270,000 barrels a day before royalties.  Nexen’s fields in Yemen were returned to full production
May 11 after being shut for two days because of a labor dispute,
according to the statement. The company also said it plans to
drill two exploration wells in the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  this year
and expects output to start from a field off West Africa next
year.  The company’s Long Lake oil-sands project is producing
28,300 barrels a day, Nexen said. The company performed
maintenance on parts of the project in April and will do further
work in August.  Nexen slipped 15 cents to C$22.09 on the Toronto Stock
Exchange. The shares have dropped 3.1 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
