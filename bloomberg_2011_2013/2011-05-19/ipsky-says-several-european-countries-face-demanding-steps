European countries undergoing fiscal
repair will need to take “difficult” steps to promote growth
and return to financial stability, said  John Lipsky , the acting
leader of the International Monetary Fund.  “Several peripheral euro-area countries today remain in
critical situations,” Lipsky said in prepared remarks before
the Bretton Woods Committee in Washington, without singling out
specific nations. “Difficult and demanding measures will be
required in order to avoid an even more serious crisis and to
restore economic health.”  The No. 2 official of the Washington-based lender did not
address the resignation of IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn
following his arrest on sexual assault charges, other than
saying, “I deeply regret the circumstances that have made it
necessary for me to substitute for the fund’s managing
director.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
