Bank of Ireland Plc, ordered by
regulators to raise 5.2 billion euros ($7.4 billion), said
customer deposits in the first four months of the year were
“marginally higher.”  The loan-to-deposit ratio rose by about 10 percentage
points from 175 percent in December, the Dublin-based lender
said in a  statement  today. Bank of Ireland had 65 billion euros
of deposits at the end of 2010. The company said it’s working
with advisers on a “range of initiatives” to raise capital and
expects to announce plans “in the coming weeks.”  Ireland’s central bank ordered four lenders on March 31 to
raise a combined 24 billion euros following a third round of
stress tests. Bank of Ireland must raise 4.2 billion euros of
equity and 1 billion euros of contingent capital by the end of
July as regulators seek to shore up confidence in the country’s
financial system. The government has said it’s prepared to
invest any money the bank can’t raise privately.  Bank of Ireland said it expects to acquire equity “through
a combination of capital management initiatives, support from
existing shareholders and other capital markets sources.”
Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG are advising
the lender on its plans.  “We believe the Irish economy has begun to stabilize,”
the bank said. Economic output is expected to “gradually
recover in 2011, due to the strong performance of the export
sector,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
