The dollar rose the most since August
against the currencies of major trading partners as reports
showed services industries expanded in December at the fastest
pace in four years and employers added jobs for a third month.    Mexico ’s peso and  Canada ’s dollar were the top performers
this week against the yen as investors became more confident in
the North American recovery before a report next week on U.S.
retail sales. The euro fell to a three-month low against the
dollar as the  Swiss National Bank  said it won’t accept bonds
from Ireland’s government and some Irish banks as collateral.  “The  U.S. economy  is on much sounder footing going
forward, which means the dollar is a more attractive currency,
especially versus Europe,” said  Richard Franulovich , a senior
currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in  New York . “For
a lot of people, you’ve reached an important milestone where
finally the dollar can benefit from good data.”  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading
partners including the euro and yen, increased 2.7 percent to
81.129 yesterday, from 79.028 on Dec. 31.  The index’s weekly rally is the biggest since an advance of
3.2 percent during the five days ended Aug. 13. That week the  Federal Reserve  said the economic recovery will be “more
modest,” spurring demand for the dollar’s safety.  The euro fell 3.6 percent to $1.2907, from $1.3384 last
week, in its biggest weekly drop since August. It touched
$1.2905, the lowest level since Sept. 14. The dollar gained 2.5
percent to 83.15 yen in the biggest increase since it rose 4.7
percent during the week ended Dec. 4, 2009.  U.S. Services  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
index, which covers about 90 percent of the U.S. economy, rose
in December to 57.1, the highest level since May 2006, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said Jan. 5.  Nonfarm payrolls rose by 103,000 in December after a
revised increase of 71,000 in the previous month, the Labor
Department reported yesterday. The median forecast of 78
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 150,000.
The  unemployment rate  slid to 9.4 percent from 9.8 percent.  “The tone for the dollar should be stronger as most of the
data has been coming in on the stronger side and funding
problems still weigh on the euro,” said Paresh Upadhyaya, head
of Americas Group-of-10 currency strategy at Bank of America
Corp. in New York.  Retail sales increased 0.8 percent in December, matching
the gain in the previous month, according to the median forecast
of 58 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The report from the
Commerce Department is due Jan. 14.  Stronger Peso  Mexico’s peso rallied 3.4 percent to 6.80 yen, and the
loonie, as the Canadian currency is known, appreciated 3 percent
to 83.71 yen. The U.S. is the biggest trading partner of Mexico
and Canada.    Australia ’s dollar fell the most versus the greenback since
November on concern floods in the state of Queensland will
impair exports of natural resources, which have helped drive
economic growth in the nation.  The Aussie dropped 2.7 percent to 99.59 U.S. cents after
trading at parity with the dollar for two weeks. The Australian
currency touched $1.0256 on Dec. 31, the highest level since it
began trading freely in 1983.  Chile’s peso declined 6 percent to 497.63 versus the
dollar, the most versus the greenback since February 2009, after
central bank President Jose De Gregorio announced a plan to buy
$50 million a day in the foreign-exchange market from Jan. 5
until Feb. 9 to offset the biggest  trade surplus  in two years.  Weaker Real    Brazil ’s real fell as the central bank set  reserve
requirements  on positions against the dollar held by local banks
in a third attempt since October to stem the currency’s rally.  The real lost 1.4 percent to 1.6840 versus the dollar,
touching 1.6937 on Jan. 6, the weakest level since Dec. 27. The
currency has appreciated 37 percent since the end of 2008.  The euro fell against the dollar this week as Switzerland’s
central bank excluded securities issued by the Irish government
as well as Allied Irish Banks Plc, Anglo Irish Bank Corp., Irish
Life & Permanent Plc and Bank of Ireland Plc from the list of
assets it accepts as collateral for its repurchase operations.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western  Europe  Index rose 1 basis
point to a record 214 basis points yesterday after credit-
default swaps on Belgium jumped 14 basis points and Ireland’s
increased by 6 basis points to an all-time high. Contracts on  Portugal  rose 9 basis points to 534, the highest since Nov. 30.  European Union  The European Union may give regulators power to block new
products and limit trading risks at banks deemed too big to
fail, as part of plans to protect public finances from future
financial crises, according to draft proposals obtained by
Bloomberg News.  “You’ve got this resurrection of fear surrounding the
peripheral European debt crisis and the fact that it’s likely to
rear its head again,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , senior market
analyst at Interactive Brokers Group LLC in Greenwich,  Connecticut .  To contact the reporters on this story:
