The  Philippines ’  monetary policy 
settings are appropriate “for the moment” and there “isn’t a
compelling reason for now to shift” as the inflation outlook
remains manageable, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said
ahead of an Oct. 20 policy meeting.  Authorities have “policy flexibility to address more
significant and sudden changes in global demand and investor
sentiment that could adversely impact inflation expectations and
domestic growth prospects,” Tetangco said in an email reply to
questions late yesterday. The economy has “sufficient
liquidity” and authorities are “closely monitoring” growth in
credit even as the central bank doesn’t see “excessive build-
ups in asset prices that signal any bubble,” he said.  “Inflation is now less of a concern,globally,” Tetangco
said. “Our assessment is that inflation will be manageable over
the policy horizon, and therefore we can afford to be more
supportive of growth, especially in light of protracted weakness
in advanced economies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
