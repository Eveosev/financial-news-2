Telkom South  Africa  Ltd. and  KT
Corp. (030200)  are drawing up contracts to complete a 4.6 billion-rand
($587 million) deal that would give the South Korean company a
20 percent stake in Africa’s biggest fixed-line phone company,
 Business Times  said, citing Jim Myers, president of the American
Chamber of Commerce.  Myers, a former Telkom executive, said there’s nothing in
Telkom’s operations that would prevent KT from buying the stake,
the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported. The transaction would
give Telkom access to capital and KT’s telecommunications
expertise, Business Times quoted Myers as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
