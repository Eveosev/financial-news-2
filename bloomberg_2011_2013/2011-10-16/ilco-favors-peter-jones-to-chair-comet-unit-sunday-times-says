Hilco, the restructuring company
seeking to buy  Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA) ’s U.K. Comet chain, has
approached telecoms entrepreneur Peter Jones about becoming
executive chairman if its bid is successful, the Sunday Times
said, citing unidentified people close to Jones.  Jones, who stars in the British television series Dragon’s
Den, is interested in the position, which would be more of a
figurehead role, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
