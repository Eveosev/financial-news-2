One woman was among a group of
candidates elected to Oman’s Shura Council in the first election
held since violent protests earlier this year, according to
results published by state-run  Oman News Agency.   Voters in the Persian Gulf Sultanate went to the polls
yesterday to elect members in the 84-member council, which
serves as an advisory board to Sultan Qaboos, Oman’s ruler for
the past four decades.  Omanis in the city of Sohar, inspired by protests across
the Arab World, held demonstrations in February demanding more
jobs and better pay. At least one person was killed in clashes
with security forces.  It is the first time that candidates for the Shura Council
were allowed to publicly campaign via media and billboards.
About 1,300 candidates ran in the election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
