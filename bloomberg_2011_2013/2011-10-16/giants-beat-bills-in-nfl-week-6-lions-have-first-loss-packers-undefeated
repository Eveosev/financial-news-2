The  New York Giants  beat the  Buffalo
Bills  on a last-minute field goal for their first victory over a
team with a winning record, while the  Green Bay Packers  stayed
undefeated and the  Detroit Lions  suffered their first loss of
the National Football League season.  Ahmad Bradshaw rushed for three touchdowns and Lawrence Tynes kicked a 23-yard field goal with 1:35 remaining as the
Giants beat the Bills 27-24 yesterday at MetLife Stadium in East
Rutherford, New Jersey.  The Giants improved to 4-2 and moved into first place in
the National Football Conference’s East Division with
 Washington ’s 20-13 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. New York’s
first three wins this season came against teams with a combined
3-13 record. The Bills are now 4-2.  “We came together as a team,” Giants quarterback Eli Manning told reporters. “Guys made the plays and it’s a big
win. At 4-2, we feel like we’re in a good spot.”  The Lions, who were 5-0 for the first time since 1956, lost
25-19 at home against the San Francisco 49ers. Alex Smith threw
a six-yard touchdown pass to Delanie Walker with 1:51 remaining
to give the 49ers a 22-19 lead at Ford Field in  Detroit . Frank Gore rushed for 141 yards and a touchdown as San Francisco
improved to 5-1.  49ers coach  Jim Harbaugh , who had a brief altercation with
Lions counterpart Jim Schwartz after the game, is the fourth
rookie coach since 1970 to start 5-1 after his team opened the
previous season 1-5 or worse. He joins Jim Mora (2004 Atlanta
Falcons), Al Groh (2000 New York Jets) and Bum Phillips (1975
Houston Oilers).  Packers Start 6-0  The Super Bowl-champion Packers improved to 6-0 for the
first time since 1965 as  Aaron Rodgers  threw three first-half
touchdown passes in a 24-3 win over the St. Louis Rams, who
slumped to 0-5.  Green Bay  is the seventh defending champion to
start the following season with six straight wins and the first
since the 2007 Indianapolis Colts.  The  New England Patriots  lifted their home winning streak
to 20 games by beating the Dallas Cowboys 20-16 on Tom Brady’s
eight-yard touchdown pass to Aaron Hernandez with 27 seconds
left. New England improved to 5-1 while the Cowboys are 2-3 and
have lost two straight games. It was the 116th victory for Brady
and Patriots coach Bill Belichick, tying Hall of Famers Dan Marino and Don Shula for the most wins by a quarterback-head
coach duo since the Super Bowl era began in 1966.  The  Atlanta Falcons  scored 17 fourth-quarter points to beat
the Carolina Panthers 31-17. Michael Turner rushed for 139 yards
and two touchdowns for the Falcons, including a 2-yard score
with 1:56 left that followed the third interception of the game
thrown by Panthers rookie quarterback Cam Newton.  Brees’s Interceptions  The Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat New Orleans 26-20 by forcing
four turnovers, including three interceptions of Saints
quarterback Drew Brees.  The Cincinnati Bengals defeated Indianapolis 27-17 to
improve to 4-2 -- matching their win total from last season --
and drop the Colts to 0-6. Carlos Dunlap returned a fumble 35
yards for a touchdown with 2:22 left to seal the Bengals’ win.  The Pittsburgh Steelers stayed even with the Bengals in the
AFC North with a 17-13 win over the  Jacksonville Jaguars .
Rashard Mendenhall rushed for a season-high 146 yards and a
touchdown as the Steelers opened a 17-0 first-half lead.  The Eagles halted their four-game losing skid with four
interceptions of Redskins quarterback Rex Grossman, including
three by Kurt Coleman. LeSean McCoy rushed for 126 yards and a
touchdown for the Eagles (2-4). The Redskins fell to 3-2.  The Oakland Raiders held off the Cleveland Browns 24-17 to
improve to 4-2, and the Baltimore Ravens have a 4-1 record after
beating the Houston Texans 29-14. The  Chicago Bears  routed the
Minnesota Vikings 39-10 in last night’s game as Devin Hester
scored two touchdowns, including one on a 98-yard kickoff return
at Soldier Field.  The Jets, after a three-game road losing skid, host the
Miami Dolphins tonight in the final Week 6 game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
