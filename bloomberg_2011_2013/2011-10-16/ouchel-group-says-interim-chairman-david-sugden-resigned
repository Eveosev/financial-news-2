Mouchel Group Plc (MCHL)  said David Sugden,
who was appointed interim chairman last week, has resigned. His
resignation follows “further discussions with the board and
other key parties about the best way to secure the group’s
future,” the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Mouchel’s lenders “are fully supportive of the board and
its executive team which believes that Mouchel has strong and
valuable businesses which need to be supported by a stable,
long-term financial structure,” the statement said.    Michael Lyons, senior independent director, will lead the
search for a new chairman and will chair the board in the
interim. Executive directors Grant Rumbles and Rod Harris are
“focused on the steps necessary to secure the future of the
company and they enjoy the full support and confidence of the
board and its lenders,” Mouchel said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
