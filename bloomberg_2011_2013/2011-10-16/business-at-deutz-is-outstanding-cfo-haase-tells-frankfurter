Business at Deutz AG is
“outstanding,”  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung 
reported, citing an interview with Chief Financial Officer
Margarete Haase.  August was a “peak month” for Deutz in terms of orders,
and sales growth could have been even faster had the company not
changed over to operating three shifts, the newspaper cited
Haase as saying.  The company’s lowered cost base means even if revenue fell
by half, the company would be able to avoid a loss, Haase said,
according to Frankfurter Allgemeine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
