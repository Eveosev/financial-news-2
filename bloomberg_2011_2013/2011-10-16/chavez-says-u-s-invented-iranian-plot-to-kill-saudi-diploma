Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
claimed that the U.S. fabricated the alleged Iranian plot to
kill  Saudi Arabia ’s ambassador to the U.S. as a way of
threatening Iranian allies in  Latin America .  “Later they’ll say, ‘Iran can only do this thanks to its
Latin American allies,’” Chavez said on state television. “Now,
they’re taking aim at us. They better not even think about
stopping Venezuela’s peaceful march because they will regret it
the rest of their days.”  The U.S. Justice Department accused Iran on Oct. 11 of
sponsoring a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to
the U.S. Chavez and Iran’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have
forged diplomatic and commercial ties as Iran faces
international sanctions over suspicions it’s trying to develop
nuclear power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
