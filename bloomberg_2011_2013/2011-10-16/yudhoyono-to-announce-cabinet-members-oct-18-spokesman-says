Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono will announce his cabinet lineup Oct. 18 and
inaugurate the members the following day, his spokesman said.  “Nobody knows the changes of the ministers except the vice
president,” Julian Aldrin Pasha told reporters at Yudhoyono’s
private residence in Bogor, West Java late yesterday.  Indonesia 
will have a cabinet in the new formation on Oct. 20, he said.  Yudhoyono, who helped secure a second five-year term in
2009 by promising to clean up graft, is trying to improve his
party’s image before campaigning begins for elections in 2014.
Yudhoyono’s public support fell to a record low of 47.2 percent
in the latest Jakarta-based  Indonesian Survey Circle  poll, taken
nationwide June 1-7.  The cabinet changes are ‘on time’ to respond the domestic
and global challenges in the next few years, Yudhoyono told
reporters on Oct. 13. Yudhoyono plans to form a “working
cabinet” in order to improve the performance in the halfway
through his five-year term, he said the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
