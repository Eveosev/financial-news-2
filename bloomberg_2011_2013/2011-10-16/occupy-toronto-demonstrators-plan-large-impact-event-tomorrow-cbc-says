A group of protesters that began
demonstrations in Toronto yesterday are planning to hold a
“large impact” event tomorrow downtown, Canadian Broadcasting
Corp.  reported .  The event, which will take place when the Toronto Stock
Exchange opens at 9:30 a.m. local time, wasn’t specified by the
news service. Nothing for that time is listed on the Occupy
Toronto  website , and a spokesperson wasn’t immediately available
to comment to Bloomberg News.  Protests inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement began
yesterday in at least 15 Canadian cities, including Montreal,
Calgary and  Vancouver , CBC reported. An anemic global economy,
the European sovereign debt crisis and high U.S. unemployment
among other causes have led to discontent among protesters
worldwide.  Dozen of protesters set up camp last night in a park near
Toronto’s financial district and plan to hold a general assembly
at 5 p.m. local time today, according to the Occupy Toronto
site. Two men were arrested in  Canada ’s most populous city
yesterday at a downtown business complex, the broadcaster said.  About 2,000 to 3,000 people gathered in Vancouver
yesterday, the largest demonstration so far in Canada this
weekend, CBC reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
