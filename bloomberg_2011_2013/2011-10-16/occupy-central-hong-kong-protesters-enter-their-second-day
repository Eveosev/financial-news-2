Members from the Occupy Central
movement held a second day of protests in  Hong Kong  today after
about 40 demonstrators slept overnight in a foyer beneath the
Asian headquarters of  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   Armed with tents, bullhorns and a gas-powered generator
used to help them recharge their laptops, the protesters
occupied the public thoroughfare under the building as about a
dozen police stood by.  “ Wall Street  has a campaign to start asking questions
about capitalism but this is not enough,” said Derrick Benig, a
22-year-old art student who slept in a tent overnight. “I want
to tear down capitalism.”  Hong Kong is one of several Asian cities including Seoul,
Taipei and  Tokyo  which have seen protests inspired by the month-
old Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City spread to their
streets over the weekend.  About 200 people gathered at the Exchange Square Podium in
the Central financial district yesterday, according to Napo
Wong, an organizer.  Sydney, Toronto and other cities also saw protests on
Saturday, which turned violent in  Rome , in what organizers
called a “global day of action against Wall Street greed.”
Backers say they represent “the 99 percent,” a nod to Nobel
Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz’s study showing the top
1 percent of Americans control 40 percent of U.S. wealth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
