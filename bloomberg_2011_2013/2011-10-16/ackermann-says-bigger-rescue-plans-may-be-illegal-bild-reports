 Increasing the size of financial
rescue packages for troubled countries in Europe may be illegal
and people won’t allow it,  Bild am Sonntag  reported, citing
 Josef Ackermann , Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Bank AG.  Increasing such funds “may be right from an investor’s
point of view, but won’t solve the problem,” the publication
cited Ackermann as saying at a conference in Berlin on Oct. 13.  He added that the only solution to the current crisis is
for countries in trouble to step-by-step reduce their debt, a
process that will slow future economic growth, the newspaper
said.  Banks and countries remain unable to refinance themselves
on financial markets and the situation needs to be resolved,
Bild cited Ackermann as saying.  Ackerman also said the euro can only be saved by a closer
political and economic integration of  Europe , a process that may
force the creation of a “new Europe,” Bild reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
