Sales at major South Korean
department stores increased in September at the slowest pace in
seven months, a sign that consumer demand may be faltering.  Outlays at the three biggest chains gained 6.5 percent from
a year earlier, after rising 8.3 percent in August, the Ministry
of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today. Discount-store
sales fell 1.1 percent, the first drop in seven months after a 2
percent gain in August, today’s report showed.  South Korean  consumer confidence  last month stayed at the
lowest level since March as people braced for fallout from a
global economic slowdown. Inflation above the central bank’s
target limit and higher  interest rates  are also curbing
consumers’ purchasing power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
