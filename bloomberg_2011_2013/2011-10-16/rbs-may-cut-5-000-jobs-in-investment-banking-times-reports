Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
plans to reduce its investment-banking business by at least a
third, putting 5,000 jobs at risk, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  European “outposts” of its corporate lending business
would be cut back, according to the report. The bank, partly
owned by the U.K. government, said on Aug. 5 it planned to cut
about 2,000 jobs.  Rebecca Nelson, a London-based spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the report when contacted today by mobile telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
