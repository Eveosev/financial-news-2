U.S. federal investigators want to
find out if District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Gray’s
administration promised an ex-candidate a job in exchange for
political attacks on a rival, the Washington Post reported
today, citing interviews with almost a dozen people.  The probe by the U.S. Attorney’s office began after former
candidate Sulaimon Brown said in March he was paid by Gray’s
campaign to criticize former Mayor Adrian Fenty during last
year’s Democratic primary, the newspaper said.  Two people, including Brown, have been fingerprinted, and
investigators have sought documents to identify anyone who may
have handled money orders or envelopes with cash that Brown says
he received from the Gray campaign, the Post said, citing two
unidentified people familiar with the probe.  The  mayor , senior campaign staff and Brown have all denied
any wrongdoing, the newspaper said.  A telephone call to the Mayor’s office today outside of
office hours by Bloomberg News wasn’t answered and there wasn’t
an immediate response to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
