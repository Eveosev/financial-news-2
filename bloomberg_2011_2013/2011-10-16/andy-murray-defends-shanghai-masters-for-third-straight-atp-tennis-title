Andy Murray  will move ahead of  Roger Federer  to No. 3 in the ATP tennis rankings after winning the
Shanghai Masters to secure a third straight title this month.  The 24-year-old Briton beat  Spain ’s David Ferrer 7-5 6-4 to
defend his Shanghai title, following successes at the Thailand
Open and  Japan  Open.  “It’s been one of the best runs of my life,” Murray told
the  ATP Tour  website. “I’ve played very, very well the last few
weeks. I was very nervous today because I wanted to win here and
defend my title.”  Murray, now with  25 wins from his past 26 matches , has
never been ahead of  Switzerland ’s Federer in the rankings.
Federer will drop out of the top three for a first time since
June 2003.  The opening game of today’s final lasted almost 10 minutes
with Murray breaking to end a run of 31 successive service holds
for Ferrer. His opponent was, though, able to break back
immediately.  Murray broke again in game 11 and managed to hold his serve
to take the first set.  The second set also started with two successive breaks, but
Murray then won on his opponent’s serve in the third game and
held for the rest of the match.  “I fought a lot, but today it was impossible to beat
Andy,” Ferrer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
