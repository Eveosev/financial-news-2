Israel ’s benchmark stock index
climbed the most in more than two years after  Discount
Investment Corp. (DISI)  agreed to sell its stake in  Shufersal Ltd. (SAE)  and
as Europe’s sovereign debt strategy received global backing.  Shufersal jumped to the highest since August.  Bank Leumi 
Le-Israel, the country’s largest lender by assets, surged the
most since 2009, and Bank Hapoalim Ltd. gained 5 percent.
Israel’s TA-25 Index, trading for the first time since Oct. 11,
rose 4.3 percent, the most since April 2009, to 1,131.34 at the
2:45 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index of
the largest Israeli companies traded in  New York  last week had
their the biggest weekly surge since October 2008.  “The Shufersal deal together with increased chances for an
EU bailout is boosting the local market,” Darren Shaw, head of
research at UBS Securities Israel Ltd. in Herzliya Pituach,
Israel, said by telephone. Stocks are also making up for gains
abroad while Israel was closed for the holidays, he added.  European officials yesterday outlined the initiatives
they’re considering at a meeting in Paris of finance ministers
and central bankers from the Group of 20 economies. With the
continent’s fiscal woes rattling financial markets and
threatening the world economy, governments were urged to
complete the plan at their Oct. 23 summit in Brussels and to
tame the threat of contagion by maximizing the firepower of
their 440 billion-euro ($611 billion) bailout fund.  Europe  and
the U.S. are Israel’s biggest trading partners.  Beating S&P  Twenty-four of the 25 companies in the Bloomberg Israel-US
25 Index gained 6.3 percent last week, beating the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index’s 6 percent advance. Global stocks rallied on
Oct. 14, extending the biggest weekly rally since July 2009, as
the G-20 began talks and U.S. retail sales beat estimates.  Israel’s stock market will close earlier than usual at 2:45
p.m. through Oct. 18 for a holiday. The bourse will be shut Oct.
19 and Oct. 20.  Shufersal gained 4.2 percent to close at 17.10 shekels.
They surged as much as 12 percent earlier after Discount
Investment agreed to sell its 46 percent stake in Israel’s
largest supermarket chain for 2.42 billion shekels ($662
million), or 24.18 shekels a share.  Discount Investment surged 9.8 percent to 36.02 shekels,
the highest level since Aug. 4.  Bank Leumi soared 7.3 percent, the most since April 2009,
to 12.38 shekels and Bank Hapoalim, the nation’s second-largest
bank, advanced to 13.49 shekels.  ‘Umbilical Cord’  “The banks in Europe and the U.S. went up last week on
positive news on the solution for debt," said Adi Scop, banking
analyst at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel
Aviv. "Israel is connected by an umbilical cord to the rest of
the world."  The  Tel Aviv Banking Index (TABANK)  advanced 6.5 percent, its
biggest jump since April 2009. The gauge has declined 26 percent
over the past six months, compared with a 15 percent drop for
the benchmark index.  Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) , Israel’s biggest maker of high-
speed networking equipment, jumped 13 percent to 46.92 shekels,
or the equivalent of $12.83. The shares soared 22 percent in the
U.S. last week to $12.93, leading the increase in the Bloomberg
Israel-US 25 Index, on growing speculation that profits at
technology companies will improve on demand for smartphones.  Israeli technology companies, which raised $569 million in
capital during the second quarter, the most in two years, are
benefiting from rising Internet traffic and increased online
video streaming. Allot will report adjusted third-quarter
earnings on Nov. 1 of 10 cents per share, according to the
median estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Apple Line  "Companies that have good exposure to robust businesses
such as smartphones’ suppliers, those are the ones that will be
holding on well," said Jay Srivatsa, an analyst at Chardan
Capital Markets LLC in New York.  Hundreds of people in cities from New York to London and
 Tokyo  lined up overnight at  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s stores to snap up the
company’s newest iPhone on Oct. 14. The device sold out for pre-
order at AT&T Inc.,  Verizon Wireless  and Sprint Nextel Corp. a
day before it officially went on sale, according to the
carriers’ websites.  Allot of Hod Hasharon, Israel, whose customers include
 Virgin Media Inc. (VMED)  and billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s fixed-line
carrier, Telefonos de Mexico SAB, developed a technology that
allows  Internet providers  to differentiate network traffic and
provide tailored plans to their clients as demand for faster
data surges.  ‘Infrastructure Market’  EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH)  increased 2.2 percent to 127.90
shekels, or the equivalent of $34.98. The maker of network
processors that counts Cisco Systems Inc. as a customer rallied
5.9 percent to $34.31 in the U.S. last week. EZchip, based in
Yokneam, Israel, will report third-quarter adjusted earnings per
share of $0.32, according to eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , the world’s largest
maker of generic drugs, gained 3.4 percent to 145 shekels, or
the equivalent of $39.66. The shares advanced 6.6 percent to
$39.17 in New York last week.  Teva last week completed its $6.2 billion acquisition of
Cephalon Inc. after winning approval from European Union
regulators.  To contact the reporters on this story:
