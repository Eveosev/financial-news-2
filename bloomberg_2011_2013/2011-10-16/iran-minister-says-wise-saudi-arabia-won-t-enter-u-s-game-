Iran’s Foreign Ministry said  Saudi
Arabia  would avoid taking part in a scenario designed by the
U.S. aimed at fueling discord between nations,  Mehr  reported.  “Saudi Arabia is wise enough to avoid entering the
political game designed by the United States, which is seeking
to create division among regional countries,” Foreign Minister
 Ali Akbar Salehi  said, according to a report published late
yesterday by the state-run news agency.  Salehi’s comments followed the U.S. accusing Iran of
backing a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to
Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
