Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC)  bought the
Hoxton Hotel in London for 68.5 million pounds ($108.4 million)
with backing from  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) , the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Sinclair Beecham, co-founder of Pret A Manger, Ronald Cohen, a founder of Apax Partners LLP, and London hotelier Kurt
Bredenbeck are among investors set to share 63 million pounds in
cash from the sale after paying back debt used to build the
hotel, according to the Sunday Times. The deal is expected to
close in two weeks, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
