European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said European Union heads of state must take
“appropriate measures” at their Oct. 23 summit to shore up
confidence in the region’s debt markets and banks.  The “measures to be taken will be difficult,” Trichet
told Europe 1 Radio in an interview today. “The decisions to be
taken at the EU meeting will have to be appropriate measures to
protect the sovereign debts and appropriate measures to protect
the financial system.”  Trichet also said the euro-area economy “probably” grew
in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter “we will see,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
