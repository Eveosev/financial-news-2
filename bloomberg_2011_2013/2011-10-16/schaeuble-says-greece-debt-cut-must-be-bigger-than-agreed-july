German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said the reduction of  Greece ’s debt by means of
private sector participation must be bigger than agreed in July
by euro region leaders in order to achieve a “sustainable
solution” for the over-indebted country.  There will be negotiations with the banking sector about a
debt cut for Greece, Schaeuble said on ARD public television. A
transcript of the interview was e-mailed by ARD.  “It is clear that there has to be a private sector
involvement that’s sufficient for a sustainable solution for
Greece,” ARD quoted Schaeuble as saying. Fighting contagion
dangers in financial markets is “at least as important,” he
said.  There are contagion risks in the banking sector and banks
need to be equipped with the “necessary” capital, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
