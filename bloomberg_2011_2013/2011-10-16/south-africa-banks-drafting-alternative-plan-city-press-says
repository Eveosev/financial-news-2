South Africa â€™s banks are drafting
their own transformation plan after the industry and labor
unions failed to agree over black ownership targets,  City Press 
reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.  The banks are considering pulling out of the financial-
sector charter, which sets targets for changing ownership ratios
in the industry, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  Labor unions and non-governmental organizations want the
target for black ownership of financial companies raised to 15
percent in 2014 from 10 percent, while banks oppose the
increase, City Press said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
