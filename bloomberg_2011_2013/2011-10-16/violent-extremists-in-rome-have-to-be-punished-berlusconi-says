Violence by demonstrators in Rome
yesterday is a “worrying signal for civil coexistence” and
rioters need to be identified and punished,  Italy ’s Prime
Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said.  Berlusconi, who described the violence as “unbelievable,”
also thanked security forces for handling the demonstrations in
a statement released yesterday.  Police arrested 12 out of 20 people held yesterday,
 Corriere della Sera  reported today, adding that more than 100
people were injured, of whom three are in serious condition.  Violent demonstrators accounted about 2,000 out of some
200,000 who turned out, Corriere reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
