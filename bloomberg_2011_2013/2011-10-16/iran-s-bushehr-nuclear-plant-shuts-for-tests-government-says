Iran ’s first nuclear power plant,
which was officially linked to the country’s electricity grid
last month, was “temporarily disconnected” for safety tests,
the government’s news website reported.  The Russian-built 1,000-megawatt Bushehr plant started
generating electricity at 50 percent of its capacity on Oct. 7,
a report in  dolat.ir  said. It was linked to the  power grid  on
Sept. 12.  The plant will be disconnected from the national grid for
“several weeks” until it can operate at full capacity by the
end of 2011, Iranian officials said last month.  The U.S. and the European Union say  Iran’s nuclear program 
may be a cover for the development of atomic weapons. Iran
rejects the allegation, saying it needs nuclear power to meet
the energy needs of its growing population.  To contact the reporter on this story:
