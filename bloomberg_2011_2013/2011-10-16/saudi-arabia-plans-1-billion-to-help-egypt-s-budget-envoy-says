Egyptian treasury bill yields
declined at an auction today after  Saudi Arabia  said it plans to
invest $500 million in Egypt’s T-bills and will give the Arab
country another $500 million to finance its  budget deficit .  The yield on three-month securities sold today fell 18
basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 12.431 percent from
last week’s auction, the lowest level in more than a month.
Egypt’s Finance Ministry sold nine-month notes at an average
13.625 percent from 13.636 percent last week.  Today’s T-bill auction is part of a plan to raise a record
170 billion pounds ($28 billion) this quarter. The country’s
borrowing costs have risen to the highest levels in almost three
years in the aftermath of the uprising that ousted former
President  Hosni Mubarak  in February. Egyptian Finance Minister
Hazem El Beblawi said last month he was in talks to draw
investments from Persian Gulf governments to help reduce yields.  Egypt relies on weekly sales of  government securities  to
fund its budget deficit, which is expected to reach 9.9 percent
of gross domestic product in the fiscal year that ends in June
2012, according to Cairo-based EFG-Hermes Holding SAE. That
compares with 9.5 percent for the year that ended last June.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 gained one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
5.99 percent on Oct. 14. The pound weakened less than 0.1
percent to 5.9691 per dollar.  Saudi Arabia’s announcement comes after El Beblawi said
Qatar provided  Egypt  with $500 million in budgetary support
earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
