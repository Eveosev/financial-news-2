Yemen’s capital Sana’a was rocked by
explosions and gunfire tonight as troops loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh battled tribal forces after the country’s leader
said his opponents are carrying out a coup.  Saleh described the opposition as “insane people, who
can’t sleep and only want to take power,” saying that will only
happen through elections, he told SABA, Yemen’s state-run news
agency. “We have strong proofs of the cooperation between
Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaeda” to encourage unrest, he said.  Thousands of Yemeni protesters clashed with security forces
and armed gunmen loyal to the president, leaving at least eight
people dead yesterday. Saleh returned to Yemen on Sept. 23 after
three months in  Saudi Arabia , where he received medical
treatment following a rocket attack in the capital.  Demonstrations began in the Arab world’s poorest country at
the end of January, inspired by revolts that ousted the leaders
of Tunisia and  Egypt . They deepened as military and tribal
leaders joined the opposition. Efforts by the Gulf Cooperation
Council to broker a power-transfer agreement have failed.  Yemen has the eighth-largest crude reserves in the  Middle
East  and relies on oil sales for 90 percent of its hard currency
earnings, according to the U.S. Energy Information Oil
Administration.  To contact the reporters on this story:
