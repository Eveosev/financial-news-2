UBS AG (UBSN)  will need about two to four
years to make it back to the top, Interim Chief Executive
Officer  Sergio Ermotti  told  SonntagsBlick .  Ermotti added in an interview that the current situation
makes it “impossible” to give absolute profit targets when the
bank presents its new strategy at the next investor conference
on Nov. 17, according to the newspaper.  Instead, UBS will provide some details, such as return on
equity over one business cycle, which he said will be lower than
in the past, SonntagsBlick reported.  He also told the newspaper that he expects the new CEO to
take office in six months at the latest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
