Brazil ’s economic situation may
change “radically” and the central bank may have to resume
interest-rate increases unless inflation slows further, former
central bank President Arminio Fraga told Veja magazine.  The central bank’s decision to cut the benchmark interest
rate in August was “daring,” though the bank’s assessment was
“logical and reasonable,” Fraga, who founded Brazilian fund
manager Gavea Investimentos Ltda., told the Sao Paulo-based
magazine.  He said the global economic situation is “scary,”
according to Veja.  To contact the reporter on this story:
