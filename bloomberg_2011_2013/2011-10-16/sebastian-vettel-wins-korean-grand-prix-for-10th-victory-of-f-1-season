Sebastian Vettel won the Korean
Grand Prix to take his 10th victory of the Formula One season
and give his  Red Bull  team its second straight constructors
title.  Vettel, 24, last week became the youngest ever two-time
world champion, securing the drivers’ title with four races
remaining. McLaren’s  Lewis Hamilton  finished second in today’s
race with Vettel’s teammate Mark Webber third. The Red Bull
finish gave it the team title.  Hamilton started in pole position today, but Vettel was
able to pass on the opening lap, and ended up winning by 12
seconds. Red Bull has dominated the world’s most-watched motor
sport in the last two seasons. Vettel has 349 points, ahead of
Button on 222, Alonso on 212, Webber on 209 and Hamilton on 196.
Red Bull took the team championship with 558 points to McLaren’s
418 and Ferrari’s 310.  “Towards the end I was able to push and get a little bit
of a gap because Lewis and Mark were fighting,” Vettel said in
a televised interview. “After the drivers, the constructors -
it’s fantastic.”  Vettel has been in pole position 12 times this season,
underscoring the superiority of his Red Bull car over Ferrari
and McLaren.  Drink-maker Red Bull GmbH spent $675 million on the team
between 2005 and 2009, according to filings by the team’s parent
company based in  Milton Keynes ,  England . Since then it has been
rewarded with two straight driver’s titles and now another
constructors’ championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
