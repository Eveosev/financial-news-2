Israeli inflation-linked bonds
dropped, pushing yields to the highest level in more than a
month after annual inflation fell to within the government’s 1
percent to 3 percent target range for the first time this year.  The yield on inflation-linked bonds due June 2014 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.26 percent at the
2:45 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , the highest since Sept. 15. Annual
inflation slowed to 2.9 percent from 3.4 percent in September,
the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said Oct. 14, below the 3.2
percent median estimate of 18 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Because the  consumer price index  was lower than expected,
people are selling inflation-linked bonds and instead are buying
shares and corporate bonds,” Oren Ossad, a bond trader at
Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd. in  Ramat Gan , Israel,
said by telephone.  Food prices declined 1.3 percent last month as consumer
demonstrations and boycotts that started in June over the cost
of cottage cheese accelerated. Tnuva Food Industries
Agricultural Co-Op In Israel Ltd., which controls about 70
percent of the dairy market, and  Strauss Group Ltd. (STRS) , which
derives about a fifth of its revenue from  milk products , have
announced price cuts this month.  Plunging Yields  The Tel-Bond 40 index of corporate bonds climbed 0.9
percent to the highest since Aug. 4. The TA-25 index of the
country’s largest companies jumped 4.3 percent, the most since
April 2009.  The yield on IDB Development Corp.’s 4.5 percent bond due
in 2018, dropped two percentage points to 8.25 percent, the
lowest since Sept. 27.  Discount Investment Corp. (DISI) ’s bond maturing
in 2018 soared, pushing the yield down 79 basis points to 6.87
percent, the lowest since Sept. 4. IDB owns 73.51 percent of
Shufersal, according to Bloomberg data.  Discount Investment agreed to sell its 46 percent stake in
Shufersal Ltd.,  Israel ’s largest supermarket chain for 2.42
billion shekels ($662 million) or 24.18 shekels a share, payable
over five years.  Discount Investment “is receiving a substantial sum that
will help service debt across the group,” Guil Bashan, an
analyst at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel
Aviv, wrote in an e-mailed note today. The 650 million shekels
in cash it receives at closing “will give it plenty of
breathing space -- at least for the time being.”  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit bond due
January 2022 rose two basis points to 4.68 percent, the highest
since Sept 26.  The shekel was little changed at 3.6559 per dollar and two-
year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of investor expectations
for rates over the period, were unchanged at 2.76 percent on
Oct. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
