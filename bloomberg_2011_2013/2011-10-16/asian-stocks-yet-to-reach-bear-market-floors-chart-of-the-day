Stocks in Asia excluding Japan may
extend a  bear-market  rally for “several” weeks before resuming
declines that could send them to new lows next year, according
to Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.  The MSCI All Country Asia excluding Japan Index rebounded
13 percent in the six days through Oct. 13, following a 31
percent plunge from its April 28 intraday high. In the four
previous periods when the Asian gauge dropped more than 30
percent from peak to trough closing levels since records began
in 1988, all were interrupted by rallies of between 14 and 45
percent, before the routs resumed. A minimum drop of 20 percent
from a peak signals to some investors a bear market.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the performance of the Asian
equities index since 1996, with bear-market rebounds denoted by
red circles. The lower panel shows daily percentage changes in
the gauge. The measure rose 1.4 percent at 469.62 on Oct. 13.  Gains should see the Asian  stock index  approach the 500
level “over the next several weeks,” Chris Roberts, head of
Asian technical strategy in Hong Kong at Mizuho, said in a Oct.
13 report. “The bear market should take 11-13 months to
complete, making March-May 2012 the expected time frame for a
final low.”  The MSCI Asia ex-Japan gauge dropped 67 percent from May
1996 to September 1998 during the Asian financial crisis, yet it
mustered a 45 percent rebound from Jan. 12 to March 25, 1998. It
increased 14 percent from May 26 to July 17, 2000, amid a 57
percent slump that spanned from February 2000 to September 2001
sparked by the bursting of the so-called dotcom bubble. An 18
percent gain from Oct. 10 to Dec. 3, 2002, failed to stop the
gauge from falling 30 percent in a year beginning April 2002.  A 66 percent plunge in the measure over 12 months from
October 2007 was marked by a 19 percent rebound from March 17 to
May 2, 2008. “The other four declines of 30 percent plus lasted
an average of 18 months,” Roberts said. “The current decline
is seven months old; it’s too soon to think that a lasting low
has been registered.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
