UBS AG Honorary Chairman Nikolaus Senn said Kaspar Villiger should hand over his position as
chairman to  Axel Weber  as early as May,  SonntagsZeitung 
reported.  “It would be good if he handed over the chairmanship at
the next general meeting in May to the already designated
successor, Axel Weber,” Senn was quoted as saying. “Weber is
an internationally known banker.”  Villiger had previously said he would remain chairman until
2013.  Senn also said  Sergio Ermotti , the UBS’s interim chief
executive officer, is a suitable candidate to be CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
