Germany  may veto requests from
countries seeking funds from the European Financial Stability
Facility that have not tried to help their banks first,  Bild 
reported, citing an interview with lawmaker Rainer Bruederle.  Europe  must prepare for writedowns on Greek bonds “in the
foreseeable future” in order to avoid the danger of contagion,
Bruederle, leader of the German Free Democrats group in the
lower house of parliament, was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
