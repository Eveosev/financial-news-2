National Bank of Kuwait (NBK)  SAK said it
didn’t have exposure to First Investment Co., a Kuwaiti Islamic
finance company known as Al-Ola, and denied a report that it was
part of a debt restructuring accord.  “NBK denies signing any restructuring debt agreement with
Al-Ola Investment," the bank said in an e-mailed statement
today. ‘‘We did not take part in this agreement and we do not
have any relationship with or exposure to Al-Ola Investment.’’  Al-Ola Chief Executive Officer Khalid al-Sanaousi told
Bloomberg News on Oct. 13 that the company signed an agreement
with its creditors to restructure 92 million dinars ($334
million). He said National Bank of  Kuwait ,  Kuwait Finance House (KFIN) ,
Burgan Bank SAK,  Kuwait International Bank (KIB) ,  Commercial Bank of
Kuwait SAK (CBK)  and Boubyan Bank were part of the accord signed in
February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
