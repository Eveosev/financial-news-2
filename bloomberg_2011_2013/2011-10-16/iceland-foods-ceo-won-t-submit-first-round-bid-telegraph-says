Iceland Foods Ltd. Chief Executive
Officer  Malcolm Walker  won’t enter the first round of bids for a
77 percent stake in the U.K. supermarket chain being sold by
Landsbanki Islands hf and Glitnir Bank hf, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Walker, who only needs to match the highest bid from a
rival in order to win, will wait to see who enters the bidding,
the newspaper said.  He is said to be close to arranging financing for an
eventual bid from several debt providers, according to the
Telegraph. Walker declined to comment, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
