Inflation in Djibouti slowed to 4
percent in September as the cost of some foods fell, the
Department of Statistics and Demographic Studies said.  The inflation rate dropped from 4.6 percent in August, the
Djibouti City-based agency said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. Prices rose 1.4 percent in the month, it said.  Djibouti, which hosts about 2,500 U.S. military personnel
at the Camp Lemonnier military base, is a Horn of Africa nation
about the size of  Massachusetts . The country has a $982 million
economy with fewer than 1 million people that relies on services
related to its strategic location on the Red Sea, one of the
world’s busiest shipping lanes, according to the U.S. State
Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
