More Swiss banks than originally
indicated were affected by the bankruptcy of  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ,  Der Sonntag  said, citing an unpublished March
2009 report by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority.  New details show that Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG
weren’t the only banks involved. Sarasin Bank & Cie. AG
customers lost 293 million francs ($329 million), HSBC Holdings
Plc’s private bank in Geneva lost 291 million francs and
Luzerner Kantonalbank AG’s loss was 131 million francs.  About 20,000 clients of Swiss banks may have lost more than
4 billion Swiss francs on structured products from Lehman after
the company filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, Der Sonntag
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
