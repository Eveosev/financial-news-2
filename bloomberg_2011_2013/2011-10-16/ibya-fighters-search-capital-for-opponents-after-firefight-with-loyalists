Libyan fighters searched
neighborhoods in Tripoli for armed supporters of  Muammar Qaddafi , after a firefight broke out between his loyalists and
opponents in the capital.  Opposition troops combed apartment buildings for Qaddafi
fighters and weapons yesterday after the battle on Oct. 14,
which marked the first major fighting in the city since the
rebels took control in August, the  Associated Press  reported.
Concern over the looting of missiles and weapons has prompted
the U.S. State Department to send dozens of contractors to the
country to help aid in recovery efforts, the New York Times
reported yesterday.  “The possibility that these weapons may cross borders is
an area of considerable concern,” Andrew J. Shapiro, the
assistant secretary of State for Political-Military affairs,
told reporters on Oct. 14 in Brussels, according to AP.  The eight-month conflict interrupted oil production in
 Libya , which has the largest crude reserves of any African
nation. National Oil Corp.’s Chairman Nuri Berruien said
yesterday that Libya’s Sharara field, which is operated by
Repsol YPF SA, is scheduled to start producing between 80,000
and 100,000 barrels a day of crude before the end of the month.  The North African country is currently producing 400,000
barrels a day of oil and is expected to meet its daily
production goal of 500,000 barrels by the end of the month,
Berruien said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
