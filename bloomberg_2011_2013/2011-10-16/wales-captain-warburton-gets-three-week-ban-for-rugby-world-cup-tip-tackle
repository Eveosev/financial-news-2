Wales captain Sam Warburton was
suspended for three weeks for a “dangerous tip tackle” in his
team’s  Rugby World Cup  semifinal loss to  France  yesterday, the
International Rugby Board said.  Open-side flanker Warburton was shown the red card by
referee Alain Rolland for upending France winger Vincent Clerc
in the 18th minute of the match at Eden Park, Auckland.  At a disciplinary hearing today, tournament judicial
officer Christopher Quinlan “found that there were no
aggravating features and there were compelling on-field and/or
off-field mitigating features including the player’s admission,
outstanding character and disciplinary record and remorse,” the
IRB said in a statement.   Warburton, who has 48 hours in which to appeal, will be
free to resume playing Nov. 7, the IRB said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
