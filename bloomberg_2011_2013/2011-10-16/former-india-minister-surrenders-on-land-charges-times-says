B. S. Yeddyurappa, former chief
minister of  India ’s Karnataka state, surrendered to police
yesterday to face allegations he illegally benefitted from real-
estate deals, the Times of India reported today.  The charges against Yeddyurappa involve claims of
“denotifying land in and around Bangalore for pecuniary
benefits to his family” and cabinet colleague Es En Krissnaiah
Setty, who was also taken into custody, the newspaper said,
without identifying the source of its information.  Yeddyurappa led the main federal opposition  Bharatiya
Janata Party ’s only administration in southern India before
resigning earlier this year, after an anti-corruption probe
implicated him in illegal mining in Karnataka. He denied any
wrongdoing at the time.  Bharatiya Janata Party spokesmen Ravi Shankar Prasad and
Prakash Javadekar were not immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
