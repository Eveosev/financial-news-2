Bank of France Governor  Christian
Noyer  said that French banks hold about 8 billion euros of Greek
sovereign debt and absorbing losses on those bonds is
“managable.”  “ Greece  isn’t a problem for French banks,” Noyer said
today on TV5 Monde.  Noyer also said that French banks should be able to meet
requirements to strengthen their balance sheets mainly out of
profits. He said that losing confidence of investors is the
biggest risk for the lenders today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
