Former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich ,
a Republican presidential candidate, said President Barack Obama
is “absolutely clueless” in his dealings with the Iranian
government.  “Our goal should be the replacement of the Iranian
dictatorship,” Gingrich said on CNN’s “State of the Union”
program. “We have done nothing of consequence to systematically
undermine the regime.”  Senator  John McCain , the Arizona Republican who lost the
2008 presidential election to Democrat Obama, also criticized
the administration’s handling of what McCain called “a rogue
nation.”  The administration’s “engagement with  Iran  has clearly
been a failure,” McCain said on CNN.  The U.S. has accused Iran of sponsoring a plot to murder
 Saudi Arabia ’s ambassador to the Washington, Adel Al-Jubeir. Two
men were charged with conspiracy to kill the diplomat in a plot
that U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder said was “directed and
approved by elements of the Iranian  government.”  Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  rejected the claims
in a Tehran meeting today. “Each day they try to campaign
against Iran,” Ahmadinejad said, according to the official
 Islamic Republic News Agency .  Both Gingrich and McCain said Obama should have done more
when students protested on the streets of Tehran. McCain called
for “severe sanctions” and said the U.S. should engage in
“covert activity” to undermine the current Iranian government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
