Spain’s opposition  People’s Party 
led by  Mariano Rajoy  widened its lead over the ruling Socialists
before next month’s general elections, opinion polls published
in  El Pais  and El Mundo showed.  The PP may win 45.5 percent support in the Nov. 20 vote,
compared with 29.7 percent for the Socialists led by Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, according to a poll by Madrid-based research
institute Metroscopia published today by El Pais.  The  poll in El Mundo  today, conducted by Madrid-based
market researcher Sigma Dos, showed the PP attracting 48 percent
backing, compared with 30.8 percent for the Socialists.  The ruling party is struggling to retain voters after
imposing the deepest austerity measures in at least three
decades and presiding over a rise in unemployment to 21 percent.
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero isn’t seeking re-
election and his party chose Rubalcaba, the former deputy prime
minister and interior minister, as its candidate.  The El Pais poll showed the PP widening its lead from
September, when the party had 44.8 percent backing compared with
30.7 percent for PSOE, the newspaper said.  The PP may be on course to win a majority in the Spanish
parliament with 185 to 190 seats in the 350-seat assembly,
compared with 115 to 120 for the Socialists, El Pais said. The
poll for El Mundo pointed to a result giving the PP 196 seats to
117 for the Socialists.  The El Pais poll had a margin of error of 2.6 percentage
points, the newspaper said. El Mundo said its poll had a margin
of error of 3.3 percentage points.  ABC newspaper today reported that a  survey  of 215
executives conducted by accounting company KPMG LLP showed that
75 percent expect  Spain ’s economy to start recovering in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
