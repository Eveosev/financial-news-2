BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  may offer 2
billion pounds ($3.16 billion) for Ferrous Resources Ltd., the
 Sunday Times  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  BHP started talks to buy the Brazilian iron ore producer
earlier this year and would consider acquiring a stake in the
company, the newspaper said.  Ruban Yogarajah, a London-based spokesman for  BHP Billiton ,
declined to comment when contacted by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
