Arab Polvara Spinning & Weaving Co. (APSW) ,
an Egyptian textiles manufacturer, rose to the highest level in
a week after its workers ended a strike.  Shares of the Cairo-based company increased 2.8 percent to
1.83 Egyptian pounds at 11:18 a.m. in Cairo, the highest
intraday level since Oct. 9. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  gained
1.2 percent.  Arab Polvara said its factories resumed operations on Oct.
15 after its workers ended a strike. The five-day work stoppage
ended after the company agreed to raise pay in accordance with
increases due to be implemented at state-owned textile
companies, Al Mal newspaper reported today, citing Chairman
Ayman Ismail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
