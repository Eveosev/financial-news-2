The time isn’t right to lift a ban
on short selling imposed in August by  Spain ,  Italy , France and
Belgium because the markets still haven’t returned to normal,
Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets
Authority, told  El Pais  in an interview.  Banks should be consistent in the way they value sovereign
debt on their books to avoid sowing confusion among investors,
Maijoor told the Spanish newspaper in an interview published
today.  ESMA should have powers to intervene temporarily in the
credit default swaps market and prohibit short selling under
certain circumstances, Maijoor also told El Pais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
