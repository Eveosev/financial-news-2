U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
said recent demonstrations seen around the world will not solve
problems in the global economy.  “Protests won’t be the answer,” Hague said in an
interview on the  BBC ’s “Andrew Marr Show” today. “The answer
is for governments to control their debts and their deficits.
Protesting in the streets isn’t going to solve the problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
