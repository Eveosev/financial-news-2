The United Mine Workers of America
reached a 5 1/2-year collective bargaining agreement with the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association, a group that represents
 Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) ’s unionized subsidiaries.  Union members in about 125 locals will vote June 17 on the
accord, which covers pensions, health care, wages and other
issues, UMW President Cecil Roberts said today in a statement.  The labor union frequently uses the contract with the
Washington-based coal association as a model for negotiations
with coal companies that aren’t affiliated with the association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
