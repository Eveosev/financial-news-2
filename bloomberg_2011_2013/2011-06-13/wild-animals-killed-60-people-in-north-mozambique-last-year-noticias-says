Crocodiles and other wild animals
killed at least 60 people in  Mozambique â€™s northwestern Tete
province last year,  Noticias  reported, citing Alberto Vaquina,
the regional governor.  Thirty-five of the victims died after being attacked by
crocodiles in the Zambezi River, the Maputo-based newspaper
reported. Tete shares borders with Malawi, Zambia and  Zimbabwe .  The government is planning measures that include shooting
animals and collecting crocodile eggs to hatch in areas where
the reptiles will be domesticated to make the area safer, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
