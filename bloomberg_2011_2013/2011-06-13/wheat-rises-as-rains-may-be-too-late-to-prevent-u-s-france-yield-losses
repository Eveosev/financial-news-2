Wheat rose for a second day in
Chicago on concern rain in the U.S. and  France  came too late to
reverse crop damage in the two largest exporters amid rising
demand for feed substitutes for corn.  Forecast thundershowers were unlikely to help winter wheat
from southern  Kansas  southward recover from drought stress,
Telvent DTN Inc. said June 10. France’s crop has suffered
irreversible damage from the country’s driest spring in half a
century, and rain in past days came too late to restore yields,
farm adviser Offre et  Demande Agricole  said June 10.  “The supply condition in the world is not that
optimistic,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte,
said by phone from Singapore today. Concern about dry weather
curbing output in some of the world’s largest wheat shippers
outweighed optimism about Russia’s return to the export market,
he said.  Wheat for July delivery gained 3.5 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $7.6275 a bushel by 1:15 p.m. Paris time on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade, paring an advance of as much as 1.4 percent.  French soft-wheat yields this year may slide 15 percent
because of drought damage to plants, cutting the harvest by 13
percent to 30.9 million metric tons, the lowest in four years,
crops office FranceAgriMer said June 8.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris dropped 2.75 euros, or 1.2 percent, to 228.50 euros
($328.76) a ton.  In the U.S. northern plains, showers and thunderstorms will
continue to delay spring-wheat and corn planting, according to
the DTN forecast.  Slow Planting  About 79 percent of the U.S. spring wheat crop was  sown  as
of June 5, behind the year-earlier 97 percent pace and the 98
percent rate for the past five years, the Department of
Agriculture said June 6. About 94 percent of the corn crop was
planted, compared with 99 percent a year earlier and a five-year
average of 98 percent, it said.  Wheat futures were 40.5 cents a bushel cheaper than corn at
the close on June 9 in Chicago, the biggest discount measured by
the most-active contract for both grains since at least 1959.
The USDA  forecast  on June 9 that 220 million bushels of wheat
would go to feed and residual use this year, up 29 percent from
a year earlier.  Corn for December delivery fell 6 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$7.065 a bushel. November-delivery soybeans declined 3.5 cents,
or 0.3 percent, to $13.7825 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
