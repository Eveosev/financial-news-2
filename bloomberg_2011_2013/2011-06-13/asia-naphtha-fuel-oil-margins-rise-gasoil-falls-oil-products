Refining margins from making  fuel
oil  and naphtha in  Asia  rose while gasoil profits fell from the
highest in almost two months.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit for the fuel, slipped 29 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $21 a
barrel, PVM data showed. The spread was at $21.29 on June 10,
the highest since April 19.  July swaps for gasoil fell 55 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$132.50 a barrel, PVM data showed.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade, rose 5 cents
to 85 cents a barrel. The spread has widened 20 cents from a
week earlier, indicating it is more profitable to make  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  Oil declined for a second day in  New York  before reports
that may show slowing economic growth in the U.S. and  China ,
curbing fuel demand in the world’s two largest crude consumers.  Crude for July delivery fell as much as 59 cents to $98.70
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $98.79 at 11:53 a.m. Singapore time.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude shrank 26 cents, or 3.3
percent, to $7.65 a barrel at 10:34 a.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based crude and
refined-products broker.  High-sulfur fuel oil swaps were unchanged at $675 a metric
ton, PVM data showed. The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to
380-centistoke grade was unchanged at $13.75 a ton.  Light Distillates  July swaps for naphtha fell $1.50, or 0.2 percent, to
$980.75 a ton, PVM data showed. The crack spread, a measure of
the refining margin for processing  Brent crude  into the
petrochemical feedstock, rose to $85.94 a ton from $77.64 at the
end of Asian trading on June 10, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
