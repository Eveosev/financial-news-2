Harvest Natural Resources Inc. (HNR) , the
Houston-based oil exploration company with operations in
Venezuela and  Russia , climbed the most in more than a year after
announcing it found crude off the coast of Gabon.  Harvest rose $1.58, or 15 percent, to $12.09 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
increase since March 16, 2010. Harvest had the second-largest
gain on the Russell 2000 Energy Index today, behind Delta
Petroleum Corp.  Oil was discovered in the Dussafu Ruche Marin-1 well in a
block in which Harvest is the operator and holds a 67 percent
interest, the company said in a statement today. Rig operator
Transocean Ltd. began drilling in 280 feet (85 meters) of water
on April 28. It has reached a vertical depth of 9,953 feet in
the Upper Dentale Formation.  The company had estimated the well held 90 million barrels,
Eric Hagen, an analyst with Lazard Capital Markets Ltd. in  New
York , said in a note to investors this morning. The find could
add $10 to Harvest’s share price, he said.  The company didn’t release an updated estimate of the
reserve potential of the discovery. Harvest said it will dig
deeper to test the amount of oil in the well. Stephen Haynes,
the company’s chief financial officer, didn’t respond to a phone
message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
