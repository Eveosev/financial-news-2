BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
money manager, hired Terrence Keeley to head a unit overseeing
relations with sovereign funds and central banks as it seeks to
double assets with such clients.  Keeley will also help expand the BlackRock Investment
Institute, which started earlier this year to provide clients
with investment analysis, executives at the New York-based
company said today in an interview. Keeley will report to Robert Fairbairn, the head of BlackRock’s client group, and Lee Kempler, executive director of the investment institute.  BlackRock, which manages $3.65 trillion in assets, oversees
$235 billion in investments for sovereign wealth funds, central
banks and government agencies around the world. Through its
BlackRock Solutions unit, the firm has helped governments
including the U.S.,  Germany , U.K. and  Switzerland  evaluate hard-
to-value debt portfolios since 2008. In January, BlackRock was
picked by Ireland’s central bank to value loans as it sought to
resolve the sovereign debt crisis in the region.  “We are very natural partners for such clients both in
terms of traditional asset management, and also some of the
broader offerings such as the advice-driven work we’ve done for
the Fed,” Fairbairn said.  Sovereign wealth funds worldwide have about $20 trillion in
assets and are among the fastest-growing investor segments,
Keeley said in an interview. BlackRock’s goal is to get at least
a 2 percent market share, which will roughly double assets the
firm manages for such investors, he said.  “We are resolutely on a growth plan, and that’s a logical
market share,” Keeley said.  Former UBS Director  Keeley, 52, was the founder and senior managing principal
of Sovereign Trends LLC, a New York-based advisory firm. From
1988 to 2010, he worked at UBS AG in the investment banking and
asset-management groups. Keeley was a managing director at UBS
when the Zurich-based investment bank hired BlackRock to analyze
a $22 billion debt portfolio that it later sold to the firm.  Keeley, who will help shape investment insights and
analysis at the BlackRock institute, earlier in his career
worked for  David Stockman , who served as President  Ronald
Reagan ’s budget director. Keeley, who has a doctorate in
economics from the University of Oxford, has been a contributing
editor to Bloomberg Television. BlackRock in April hired
McKinsey & Co.’s Kempler to start its investment institute.  BlackRock was co-founded in 1988 by Chief Executive Officer
Laurence D. Fink, who has since built the firm through
acquisitions including the December 2009 purchase of  Barclays
Global Investors . The $15.2 billion deal added passive funds
such as ETFs to BlackRock’s active stock and bond strategies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
