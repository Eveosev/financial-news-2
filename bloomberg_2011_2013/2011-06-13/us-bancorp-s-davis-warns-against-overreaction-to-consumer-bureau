Richard K. Davis, chairman and chief
executive officer of  US Bancorp (USB) , said banks shouldn’t
“overreact” to the creation of the U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, or worry about its effect on business.  “It is just simply timely and topical because it’s new and
we haven’t had it before,” Davis said today at a conference of
the  Consumer Bankers Association  in Orlando,  Florida . “But
don’t think it’s going to be that harmful.”  Davis, who heads Minneapolis-based US Bancorp, the fifth-
largest U.S. lender by deposits, was one of the first major bank
executives to meet with  Elizabeth Warren , the Obama
administration adviser who was appointed to set up the new
consumer regulator in September, according to her calendar.  “The original mandate of the CFPB was a good one, which is
disclosure, transparency, clarity,” Davis said. “I love all of
that, and I think they are making some progress there.”  Davis urged bankers to accept the new regulator although
“we should push back when they are overreaching.” Davis added
that he advised that approach regardless of who becomes the
bureau’s first director.  “I think we probably ought to embrace it and move forward
and work with whomever is in that position,” Davis said.  The consumer bureau needs a director in place by July 21 to
assume its full powers under the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory
overhaul. President  Barack Obama  hasn’t yet nominated anyone to
the position.  To contact the reporter on this story:
