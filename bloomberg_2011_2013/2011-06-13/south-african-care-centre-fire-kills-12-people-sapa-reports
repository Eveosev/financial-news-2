Twelve people died and 27 were
injured in a fire at a South African care center for the aged
and mentally handicapped, the South African Press Association
said, citing Gauteng health department spokesman Sello Mokoena.  The fire broke out in the womenâ€™s wing of the Struisbult
Care Centre in Springs, east of Johannesburg, SAPA said. The
wing, which accommodated 59 people, was gutted by the fire,
causing the roof to collapse, the Johannesburg-based news
service said.  Forensic investigators will probe the cause of the blaze,
SAPA said. In August last year, 22 people died in a fire at the
Pieter Wessels home for the aged in nearby Nigel, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
