National Iranian Oil Co. cut the
cost for July shipments of its Iranian Light crude to refiners
in  Asia  and increased prices for its other grades to the region,
according to a company official.  The state-run producer lowered the price formula for
Iranian Light crude by 72 cents, to $1.71 a barrel more than the
regional benchmark, said the official, who asked not to be
identified since Iran doesn’t publish its price list.  The move follows a similar pricing decision this month by
 Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest oil exporter. Saudi Arabia’s
state producer cut official selling prices for light grades for
customers in Asia in July and raised the cost for medium and
heavy crudes to that region, it said June 5.  Persian Gulf oil producers such as  Saudi Arabia  sell most
of their crude under long-term contracts to refiners. Most of
the region’s state oil companies price their oil at a premium or
discount to a benchmark and many follow Aramco’s pricing trend.  The following table gives differentials of Iranian crude
supplied to Asia in relation to benchmark prices and the month-
on-month change. Prices are in U.S. dollars a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
