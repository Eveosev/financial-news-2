Air France-KLM (AF)  Group said some
flights in and out of Paris Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports
may suffer minor delays as maintenance personnel began an
indefinite strike.  “There may be some slight disruption, but no cancellations
are foreseen at this stage,” Air France spokesman Herve Erschler said by telephone. He declined to comment on the number
of workers taking part in the action.  The strike call, issued by the SNMSAC-UNSA union, urged
ground maintenance crews to walk out at 5 a.m. local time today
to press wage demands. Air France passengers are advised to
check their flight times on the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
