Palm oil  prices may fluctuate at
current levels as production from Indonesia continues to grow,
the nation’s trade minister Mari Pangestu said.  “Prices have gone pretty much to its peak,” Pangestu told
Bloomberg Television in Jakarta today. “Now, it’s probably
going to be stabilizing and maybe just fluctuating around the
current level. I think it will still be above a $1,000.”  Palm oil prices have declined 19 percent from a 35-month
high of 3,967 ringgit ($1,304) a metric ton on Feb. 10 on
prospects of increased supplies from Indonesia and  Malaysia , the
largest producers, due to favorable weather. The August-delivery
contract gained 0.6 percent to 3,259 ringgit a ton on the
Malaysia Derivatives Exchange today.  Indonesia ’s production is expected to continue growing at
the current rate of 10 percent to 12 percent each year, Pangestu
said. Output this year may rise 8.2 percent to as much as 23.8
million tons, researcher Oil World said in March. Indonesia may
produce 25.4 million tons of palm oil in the year beginning Oct.
1, up from 23.6 million a year earlier,  according  to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Services.  Exports to  China  may decline “a little bit” as demand
wanes amid signs of a cooling economy, Pangestu said. Still,
Indonesia has other markets such as  India , which is “growing
rapidly,” and is also exploring new markets, she said. The
country will also look into increasing domestic  processing, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
