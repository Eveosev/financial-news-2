Mali  expects to increase cotton-seed
production by 67 percent this year after the government
introduced incentives to boost output, President Amadou Toumani
Toure said.  Production may increase to 500,000 metric tons in the 2011-
12 season that has just started and ends in February, compared
with an annual average of 300,000 tons over the past five years,
Toure told reporters yesterday in Bamako, the capital.  Cotton is Maliâ€™s second-biggest foreign-exchange earner,
after gold. Last month, Toure announced the government would
purchase the fiber from growers at 225  CFA francs  (49 cents) per
kilogram (2.2 pounds), compared with 185 francs last year. The
state will also subsidise farming inputs including fertilizer,
Toure said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
