Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts rose after economists increased their
expectations for inflation next year for the first time in a
month.  Yields on the contracts due in January 2012 climbed one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.41 percent at 9:41
a.m. New York time. The real strengthened 0.4 percent to 1.5911
per dollar, from 1.5970 on June 10.  Analysts predict consumer prices will rise 5.13 percent
next year, compared with a 5.1 percent forecast the previous
week, according to the median estimate in a June 10 central bank
survey of about 100 economists published today. Central bankers
raised the benchmark lending rate 25 basis points last week to
12.25 percent, keeping a pledge to raise borrowing costs for a
“sufficiently long period” to bring inflation back to their
target in 2012, according to a statement accompanying the June 8
decision.  “Everyone thinks we have more inflation ahead,” David Rocha, a fixed-income trader at Renascenca DTVM Ltda, said in a
telephone interview from  Sao Paulo . “We’re going to wait for
the minutes to see how ‘sufficiently long’ the monetary
tightening will be.”  Policy makers are scheduled to release the minutes of last
week’s meeting on June 16. Consumer prices rose 6.55 percent in
the year through May. The central bank aims to slow inflation
back to the mid-point of its target in 2012. The government
targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage
points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
