VF Corp. (VFC) , the world’s largest
apparel maker, climbed the most since 2008 in New York trading
after agreeing to buy hiking-boot company  Timberland Co. (TBL)  for
about $1.8 billion.  The per-share price is $43, the companies said today. VF
will pay about 12 times Timberland’s earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That compares with the 9.7 median multiple in nine
shoe and clothing deals since 2006.  The acquisition, the biggest in VF’s 112-year history, will
push its sales of outdoor and sports gear to more than half the
total, which reached $7.7 billion last year. The maker of
Wrangler jeans plans to cut costs at Timberland and boost the
brand’s revenue by 10 percent annually by expanding in Europe
and  China , executives said on a conference call today.  “They’re doubling down on the lifestyle brands which
typically have higher growth rates,” said Sarah Henry, an
analyst for Manulife Asset Management in  Berwyn ,  Pennsylvania .
“It’s a good fit and going to boost earnings, which is driving
the stock.” Her firm oversaw about $217 billion, including VF
shares, through April.  VF, based in Greensboro,  North Carolina , rose $9.21, or 10
percent, to $101.01 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, the biggest gain since October 2008.
Timberland advanced 44 percent to $43.20.  Increasing Profit  VF projected Timberland will boost per-share profit by 25
cents this year and 75 cents in 2012. Analysts anticipate profit
of $7.25 this year, according to the average of estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. They predict $8.03 in 2012.  Timberland may add as much as $2 a share in profit by 2015,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Eric Wiseman said in a
telephone interview.  The acquisition price is 43 percent more than Stratham, New
Hampshire-based Timberland’s closing price June 10. Last month,
Timberland’s shares fell the most in more than 23 years after
increasing costs for labor, materials and transportation ate
into profit.  “Timberland has been our No. 1 acquisition priority,”
Wiseman said on the call. “It knits together two powerful
companies into a new global player in the outdoor and action
sports space.”  Over the past five years, the buyers of more than 40
footwear makers paid an average premium of about 21 percent
compared with the average price of 20 trading days before the
deal’s announcement, according to Bloomberg data. VF agreed to
pay a 36 percent premium on that basis.  Timberland Sales  The acquisition, the biggest in the footwear industry in at
least five years, has an enterprise value of about $2 billion
net of cash acquired. Scheduled to close in the third quarter,
it will probably add about $700 million to VF’s revenue in 2011.
Almost three-quarters of Timberland’s $1.43 billion in sales
last year came from footwear such as hiking boots, while the
rest came from apparel, accessories and royalties.  More than 100 retail company takeovers have been announced
in  North America  over the past year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The value of deals is now about $27 billion, more
than quadruple the amount a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
