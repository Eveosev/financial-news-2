European stocks pared their gains,
with the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index trading near a 2 1/2
month low, as carmakers dropped and banks climbed. U.S. futures
were little changed, while Asian shares retreated.  Banco Popolare SC (BP)  rose 2.2 percent on a report that the
lender may sell assets to avoid holding a rights offer.  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  gained 1.2 percent as investors speculated the
bank may cut jobs as part of plan to save 1 billion pounds ($1.6
billion). Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. jumped 4.5 percent
after the Sunday Times said Glencore International Plc may make
a bid.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained less than 0.1
percent to 268.18 at 10:05 a.m. in  London  after the benchmark
measure last week slid 2 percent. The gauge has retreated for
six consecutive weeks, the longest stretch of losses since 2008,
as U.S. economic data trailed forecasts and speculation grew
that  Greece  will default on its debt, adding to concern that the
global recovery is faltering.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in September
lost less than 0.1 percent today after the benchmark gauge
tumbled more than 2 percent last week. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Index dropped 0.6 percent today as China’s lending tumbled and
Japanese machinery orders fell for the first time in four
months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
