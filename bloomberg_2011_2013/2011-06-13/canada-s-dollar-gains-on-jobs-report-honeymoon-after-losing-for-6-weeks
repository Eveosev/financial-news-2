Canada ’s dollar gained against its
U.S. counterpart as an unexpected decline in the nation’s
jobless rate reported last week burnished the currency’s appeal.  The rise was tempered by a drop in crude oil, the nation’s
largest export. The loonie, as the Canadian currency is
nicknamed for the image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin,
strengthened against the  U.S. dollar  after declining for six
weeks, the longest losing streak since December 2007, and
touched a one-week high versus the euro.  The loonie appreciated 0.4 percent to 97.61 cents per U.S.
dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 97.99 cents on June 10. It
gained earlier as much as 0.5 percent to 97.51 cents. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0244.  “Fundamentally Canada has done extremely well, and after
the jobs report the Canadian dollar has strengthened especially
on the crosses,” said  Dean Popplewell , head analyst in Toronto
at the online currency-trading firm Oanda Corp. “To pick up any
momentum against the dollar, Canada would have to break through
the 97 cent level, and on the topside all we’re seeing is orders
to buy Canada around 98 cents.” Crosses are trades involving
currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  The loonie climbed as much as 0.5 percent versus the euro
to touch C$1.3992, the strongest since June 2, before trading at
C$1.4068, down less than 0.1 percent. It gained 0.3 percent to
82.20 yen, from 81.98 on June 10.  The currency pared its rise against the U.S. dollar and
erased gains versus the euro as crude oil for July delivery fell
2.4 percent to $96.91 a barrel in  New York . The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index was 0.1 percent higher after climbing as much
as 0.5 percent.  Weighing on Loonie  “We are continuing to see declines in crude oil, and
that’s weighing on the loonie against the majors,” said  Brian Dolan , chief strategist at FOREX.com, a unit of online currency
trading firm Gain Capital in Bedminster,  New Jersey . “The
market is looking at oil and stocks today, and the U.S. dollar
is down.”  The greenback weakened versus 13 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts before a report tomorrow forecast by economists in
a Bloomberg News survey to show U.S. retail sales fell 0.5
percent in May, the first decline in 11 months. The U.S. is
Canada’s biggest trade partner.  Shorter-term  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on
Canada’s two-year benchmark up two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.46 percent. The 1.75 percent security due
in March 2013 dropped 3 cents to C$100.49. Yields on 10-year
notes were little changed at 3 percent.  Jobless Rate  Canada’s unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent last month
from 7.6 percent in April, a Statistics Canada report showed on
June 10 in Ottawa. Employers added a net 22,300 jobs last month
after an increase of 58,300 in April. The median forecasts of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg were for the jobless rate to
hold at 7.6 percent and payrolls to gain 20,000 positions.  “The Canadian dollar is still enjoying a little bit of a
honeymoon from its employment number on Friday,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at online currency trader GFT
Forex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
