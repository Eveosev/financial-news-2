India ’s rupee dropped the most in
three weeks as concern the global economic recovery is slowing
prompted investors to favor safer bets than emerging-market
assets.  Overseas funds sold $119.7 million more Indian shares than
they bought last week, compared with net purchases of $613
million a week earlier, data from the stock market regulator
showed. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of equities fell for a
fourth day before a report tomorrow that economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predict will show U.S. retail sales dropped in May for
the first time since June 2010.  “Global macro-economic developments suggest currencies
like the rupee will remain under pressure,” said  Roy Paul ,
deputy general manager in charge of currencies and  fixed income 
at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “The rupee will weaken further
in coming days and weeks.”  The rupee depreciated 0.3 percent to 44.8575 per dollar as
of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It may drop to 45.10 this week, Paul predicted.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.48 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 45.36 on June 10. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
