Manchester United  signed Blackburn
defender Phil Jones to a five-year contract after reaching a
transfer agreement with his former  soccer club .  The 19-year-old passed a medical examination last week in
Manchester and will join the Premier League champions when he’s
finished at the European Under-21 tournament, United said today
on its website. He came up through Blackburn’s youth team, and
played his first match with the senior team in September 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
