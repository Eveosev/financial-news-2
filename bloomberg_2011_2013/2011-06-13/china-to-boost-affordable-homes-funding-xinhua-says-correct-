(Corrects title of official in first paragraph.)  China â€™s central government will
increase funding it provides to local governments for the
building of affordable housing projects, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported late yesterday, citing Vice Premier Li Keqiang.  A financial mechanism should be set up to bring in more
funds for the construction of affordable housing, Xinhua cited
Li as saying. Priority in  land use  should also be given to
affordable housing projects and the pace of approval should be
quickened, Li was cited as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
