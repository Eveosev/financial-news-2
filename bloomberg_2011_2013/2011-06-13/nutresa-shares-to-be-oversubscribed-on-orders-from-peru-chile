A $295 million share sale by Grupo
Nutresa SA,  Colombia ’s biggest food producer, will likely be
oversubscribed as Chilean and Peruvian funds place orders, said
Chief Executive Officer Carlos Enrique Piedrahita.  “There are many and large orders from pension and mutual
funds from  Peru  and  Chile ,” Piedrahita told reporters today in
Bogota. “The issuance will surely be oversubscribed at this
rate.”  Nutresa is conducting the first Colombian share sale since
bourses in Peru, Chile and Colombia began integrated trading on
May 30. Nutresa announced June 9 that it would sell 25 million
shares for 20,900 pesos each, a 16 percent discount to the price
of the stock on the day before the announcement.  The sale period began June 10 and will last until July 1.  The stock fell for a third day today, declining 1.9 percent
to 22,560 pesos in Bogota at 12:26 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
