Dharmesh Pancholi, senior manager in
equity advisory at Sharekhan Ltd. in Mumbai, comments on the
outlook for Indian stocks.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
 India  Ltd. traded little changed at 5,483.5 at 3:11 p.m. local
time. The gauge slid 3.3 percent in May, the most since January.  On outlook for equities:  “Nifty is likely to continue trading in the 5,350-5,600
range in the near term. If the U.S. does not extend QE2, the
dollar will strengthen leading to weakening of global commodity
prices, a negative for commodity stocks. The withdrawal of QE2
may result in increased outflow of overseas funds from domestic
equities. However, a good monsoon can be a positive trigger.”  Foreigners pulled out $1.5 billion from Indian stocks in
May, the most in a year, according to data from the regulator.  On  interest rates :  “Even a 25 basis points hike in repo rate by the  Reserve
Bank  of India June 16 will not be accepted well by the markets.
The move will restrict liquidity for the equity markets.”  India’s central bank has raised rates nine times since in
15 months to tackle inflation.  On stock recommendations:  “We are advising clients to buy select midcap stocks like
Divi’s Laboratories Ltd. and Max India Ltd., which is managing
costs effectively and growing well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
