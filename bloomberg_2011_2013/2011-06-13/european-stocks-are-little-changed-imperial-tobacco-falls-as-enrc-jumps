European stocks were little changed
after the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index tumbled to a 2 1/2
month low last week. U.S. futures were also little changed,
while Asian shares dropped.  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT)  decreased 1.7 percent after the
company said profit may be reduced in  Spain . Eurasian Natural
Resources Corp. jumped 5.2 percent after a report that Glencore
International Plc may make a 12 billion-pound ($19.5 billion)
bid for the metals producer. Invensys Plc rose 1.5 percent on a
report that the company may sell its pension program.  The Stoxx 600 gained 0.1 percent to 268.36 at 8:03 a.m. in
London after the gauge last week declined 2 percent. The gauge
has retreated for six consecutive weeks, the longest stretch of
losses since 2008, as U.S. economic data trailed forecasts and
speculation grew that  Greece  will default on its debt, adding to
concern that the global recovery is faltering.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
