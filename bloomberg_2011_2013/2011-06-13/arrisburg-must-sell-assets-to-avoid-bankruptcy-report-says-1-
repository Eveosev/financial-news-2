Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania ’s capital,
must sell its debt-laden incinerator and parking system, freeze
wages, and change workers’ contracts to avoid filing for
bankruptcy, said consultants hired under the state’s program for
distressed municipalities.  Harrisburg on Dec. 15 entered the program, known as Act 47,
after a fiscal crisis prompted by debt on its incinerator that’s
five times its general-fund budget. The city of 49,500 nearly
defaulted on a general-obligation bond in September.  Harrisburg will run out of cash and be unable to pay bills
or its workers by October, the consultants said in a recovery
plan released today.  “Failure to act and to achieve consensual solutions with
parties of interest will produce catastrophic results for the
city,” the consultants wrote in an executive summary. “It will
also damage the reputation of the Keystone State at a national
level should its capital city be forced into bankruptcy.”  The recovery plan must be approved by the mayor and council
within 25 days after a public hearing. If they fail to, the city
would incur penalties, such as loss of state aid.  Mayor  Linda Thompson  said in an e-mailed statement today
that she won’t comment before the plan is presented tonight to
the City Council.  “There is no silver bullet in the plan, but I’m hoping
City Council will work with the mayor and staff to reach an
agreed plan of action in the best interests of the city and the
region,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
