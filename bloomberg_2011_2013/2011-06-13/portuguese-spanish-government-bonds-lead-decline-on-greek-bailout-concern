Portuguese and Irish 10-year bond
yields rose to euro-era records as securities from  Europe ’s most
indebted nations declined on speculation a stalemate is
developing over Greece’s second bailout.  German 10-year bund yields fell to a five-month low as
investors sought the euro-region’s safest assets. Two-year
German yields reached the lowest since March 17, while the
spread between Portuguese 10-year bonds and German bunds widened
to a record. Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said
a bailout for Greece must include “voluntary” investor
participation. Costs to insure Greece, Ireland and  Portugal ’s
debt against default reached all-time highs.  “The uncertainty surrounding Greece is weighing on
peripherals,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in London. “There’s a lot to be
sorted in a short space of time. The market is clearly
preoccupied with the outcome of the Greek debate.”  The Portuguese 10-year yield climbed 21 basis points to
10.64 percent as of 4:13 p.m. in  London . It reached 10.72
percent earlier. The 3.85 percent security due April 2021
dropped 0.87, or 8.7 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,437) face amount,
to 59.78. The two-year note yield rose above 12 percent for the
first time since May 10, reaching 12.04 percent.  The additional yield investors demand to hold 10-year debt
from Portugal instead of bunds widened to as much as 777 basis
points, or 7.77 percentage points. That’s the most since at
least 1997, when Bloomberg began collecting the data.  The yield on Irish 10-year government bonds rose 12 basis
points to 11.36 percent, after reaching a euro-era record of
11.37 percent.  Default Swaps  Credit-default swaps on Ireland soared 27 basis points to
740 basis points, Portuguese CDSs climbed 23 to 765 and Greek
swaps jumped 21 basis points to an all-time high of 1,598,
according to CMA.  A second bailout for Greece in little more than a year must
involve the “participation of private creditors,” Juncker, who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said in an
interview on Radio Berlin-Brandenburg on June 11. “It must be
voluntary,” he said.  Juncker is trying to bridge the gap between German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , who has called for Greek
bondholders to extend the maturities of their debt by seven
years, and European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet ,
who says imposing losses on creditors would be akin to a
default.  Trichet Speech  Speaking in London today, Trichet said the crisis shows the
region needs tougher economic and budget rules.  “The economic-governance framework devised in the 1990s
has not been implemented and, in any case, has proved too weak
during the crisis,” Trichet said in a speech at the  London
School of Economics . “The crisis has exposed a clear need for
strong reform.”  Greek 10-year bonds fell for a fifth straight day, driving
the yield 24 basis points higher to 16.97 percent. The two-year
note yield climbed 18 basis points to 26.13 percent. It reached
26.49 percent earlier, the most since May 26.  Greece  plans to sell as much as 1.25 billion euros of 182-
day Treasury bills tomorrow.  Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann raised the pressure on
governments to agree to a Greek bailout without the ECB’s
participation in easing the country’s debt burden.  Sales, Cuts ‘Crucial’  Weidmann said the ECB was unwilling to turn its emergency
bond-buying program into a “lasting institution” and that
Greece’s implementation of austerity measures and asset sales
was crucial to securing the handout. He spoke yesterday in an
interview with German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.  The Frankfurt-based central bank began buying the bonds of
distressed nations in May 2010 in an effort to calm markets as
Greece’s fiscal woes threatened to spread to other euro-area
nations. It has since bought about 75 billion euros of bonds.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield was little changed at 2.95
percent. It reached 2.94 percent earlier, the lowest level since
Jan. 12. Yields on two-year notes were also little changed, at
1.53 percent, after dropping to as low as 1.51 percent.  Spanish bonds fell before the nation sells as much as 3.5
billion euros of debt maturing in October 2019 and July 2026 on
June 16. The 10-year bond yield added two basis points to 5.49
percent.  Spain  is scheduled to sell 5.5 billion euros of 371-day
and 546-day Treasury bills tomorrow.  Italian Bonds  Italian bonds were little changed, leaving the 10-year
yield at 4.79 percent. The spread versus German bunds widened as
much as four basis points to 188 basis points, the most since
Jan. 12, before narrowing to 183. Italy plans to sell as much as
3.5 billion euros of securities due in April 2016 tomorrow.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a return of
0.4 percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and
Bloomberg, while Treasuries have returned 3.2 percent. Spain’s
debt has gained 2.2 percent, Portuguese securities have lost 16
percent, Greek debt dropped 15 percent, while Irish bonds
declined 9 percent, the indexes show. Italian securities have
returned 2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
