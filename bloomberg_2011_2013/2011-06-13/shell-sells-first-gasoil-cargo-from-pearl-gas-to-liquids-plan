Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold the first
cargo of gasoil from the Pearl gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar,
advancing the project that aims to bolster production growth for
Europe’s biggest oil company.  The first commercial shipment of fuel was sold from the
world’s largest GTL plant today, Shell and Qatar said in an e-
mailed statement, without saying who bought the cargo. Pearl
will reach full capacity by the middle of 2012, when it is
expected to produce 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas per day from
the North Field for conversion into kerosene, gasoil, base oils,
paraffin and naphtha, Shell said.  Shell Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser  said the company
will boost output by 11 percent between 2009 and 2012 on new
projects in the  Middle East , Brazil and Australia. Shell’s $19
billion investment in GTL technology in Qatar may also be used
to convert U.S. shale gas into  jet fuel  and diesel.  “Today’s milestone provides further evidence that
innovative technology and strong partnerships can help meet the
world’s growing need for energy,” Voser said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
