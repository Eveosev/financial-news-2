Yields on Peruvian bonds held at
their lowest level in almost three months after the central bank
unexpectedly left the interest rate unchanged and on speculation
President-elect Ollanta Humala will continue policies that have
spurred the region’s fastest growth.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was little changed at 6.45
percent at 3:57 p.m. New York time, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit. That’s the lowest level since March 21. The
bond’s price remained at 109.53 centimos per sol.  “Confidence is increasing in  Peru  bonds,” said  Mario Guerrero , an economist at Scotiabank Peru in  Lima . “Inflation
is anchored, allowing the central bank to pause in its rate
increases. We’re also seeing a return of capital to the market
given Humala has sent conciliatory messages.”  Peru’s central bank left its key rate at 4.25 percent at a
June 9 meeting after investment in the Latin American country
slowed ahead of the June 5 presidential election won by Humala.
The central bank’s decision surprised 12 of 17 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg who expected a quarter-point increase.
Five economists predicted no change in rates.  Humala said last week he plans to follow the Brazilian
government’s socio-economic model of fast growth and prudent
macroeconomic policies, combined with policies that seek to
bring poor people into the middle class.  The sol was little changed at 2.7625 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7615 on June 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
