The  Swiss franc  strengthened to a
record against the euro as the absence of an agreement on a
financial rescue for Greece drove investors to seek the safest
European assets.  The franc rose against all but one of its 16 major peers
monitored by Bloomberg as the deepening risk of contagion from
Greece’s debt crisis drove Portuguese and Irish bond yields to
records. A report last week showed Swiss unemployment fell to a
two-year low in May. Swiss National Bank officials will probably
decide on June 16 to keep borrowing costs at 0.25 percent,
according to the median of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The Swiss franc offers a fantastic safe haven as well as
a real value play,” said Elizabeth Gregory, a Geneva-based
market strategist at Swissquote Bank SA. “The turmoil in  Europe 
is still ongoing and the growth prospects for  Switzerland  are
looking rosy. The trend in Swiss franc strength will continue.”  The franc appreciated as much as 0.8 percent to a record
1.2004 per euro and was at 1.2034 as of 4:26 p.m. in  London . It
was 0.7 percent stronger versus the dollar at 83.71 centimes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
