The Export-Import Bank of  China  is
ready to make yuan-denominated loans to  Kazakhstan  and the
central Asian nation has already expressed an interest in
borrowing in the Chinese currency, Li Ruogu, chairman of the
Beijing-based lender said.  “We can start lending in yuan right now, but it depends on
partners’ demand,” Li said in an interview today in Astana,
Kazakhstan’s capital. The bank’s partners are ”not
necessarily” seeking to borrow in U.S. dollars, he said.  Exim Bank has already lent $6 billion to $7 billion to
customers in Kazakhstan, Li said, declining to provide figures
for its lending plans this year and next year.  Kazakhstan, central Asia’s biggest energy producer, secured
$10 billion in loans from China in 2009 in return for a stake in
oil producer AO Mangistaumunaigas. The aid comprised a $5
billion loan from Ex-Im Bank to the  Development Bank  of
Kazakhstan and $5 billion from China National Petroleum Corp. to
KazMunaiGaz National Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
