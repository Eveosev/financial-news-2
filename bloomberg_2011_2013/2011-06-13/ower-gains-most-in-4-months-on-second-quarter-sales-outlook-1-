Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (TSEM)  climbed the
most in four months after the maker of customized chips forecast
second-quarter revenue will probably exceed analystsâ€™ estimates.  The shares jumped 7.4 percent, the most since Feb. 13, to
3.77 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The stock has
declined 24 percent this year, giving the Migdal Haemek, Israel-
based company a market value of 1.2 billion shekels ($351
million).  Revenue will range from $136 million to $142 million in the
second quarter, Tower said today in a Business Wire statement.
The average estimate of two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for sales of $130.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
