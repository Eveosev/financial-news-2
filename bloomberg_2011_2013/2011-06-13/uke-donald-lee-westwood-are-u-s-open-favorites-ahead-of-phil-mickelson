Luke Donald  and Lee Westwood are co-
favorites at golf’s U.S. Open, where they’ll seek to become the
first Englishmen in 41 years to win the season’s second major
championship.  The 111th U.S. Open is scheduled for June 16-19 at
Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland.  Donald and Westwood, the top two players in the  Official
World Golf Ranking , are listed at 10-1 odds, according to the
Las Vegas Hilton’s Race and Sports Book. Tony Jacklin was the
last English golfer to win the U.S. Open, in 1970.  Donald and Westwood, neither of whom has won a major title,
are followed by  Phil Mickelson  of the U.S. at 12-1 and Rory McIlroy of  Northern Ireland  at 15-1.  “I’d love to win our national Open,” Mickelson, a five-
time U.S. Open runner-up, said on June 5. “I just need a few
breaks here and there or maybe a few less mistakes here or there
to be able to come out on top.”  Three-time champion  Tiger Woods  had been listed at 15-1
before pulling out of the tournament last week as he recovers
from knee and ankle injuries.  Martin Kaymer, Dustin Johnson,  Nick Watney , Hunter Mahan,
Matt Kuchar and Steve Stricker are given 25-1 odds at the Las
Vegas Hilton, followed by K.J. Choi at 30-1.  Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland has 50-1 odds as he
seeks to become the first  U.S. Open  winner to retain the title
since Curtis Strange in 1988-89. McDowell’s win at Pebble Beach
Golf Links last year made him the first European golfer to
capture the tournament since Jacklin.  Since 1991, Woods and Retief Goosen are the only U.S. Open
champions to finish better than 40th while trying to defend
their titles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
