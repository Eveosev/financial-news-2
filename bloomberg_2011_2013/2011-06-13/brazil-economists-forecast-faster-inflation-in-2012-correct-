Economists covering the Brazilian
economy raised their forecasts for inflation next year for the
first time in a month, on skepticism the central bank will do
enough to slow inflation to its target next year.  Consumer prices will rise 5.13 percent next year, according
to the median forecast in a June 10  central bank survey  of about
100 economists published today. The figure was up from 5.1
percent the previous week.  Economists cut their forecast for 2011 inflation for a
sixth straight week. Prices, as measured by the IPCA index, will
rise 6.19 percent this year, the survey found, from a forecast
of 6.22 percent the previous week. The economists also cut their
forecast for monthly inflation in June for an eighth consecutive
week.  Economists remain “somewhat skeptical” that the central
bank will raise  interest rates  enough to slow inflation to its
4.5 percent target next year, even as lower fuel costs are
helping bring down expectations for 2011, said Flavio Serrano,
senior economist at Espirito Santo Investment Bank in  Sao Paulo .  “Despite some deceleration for headline inflation, we
don’t see the same behavior from  core inflation ,” Serrano said,
speaking by phone from Sao Paulo. “Service sector inflation
remains strong.”  Benchmark Rate  Brazil ’s central bank increased borrowing costs for a
fourth consecutive meeting last week, raising its benchmark
lending rate a quarter point to 12.25 percent. Policy makers
signaled they are prepared to raise rates further this year, to
cool inflation that exceeded the upper limit of the government’s
target range in April and May.  Economists expect a further quarter point increase next
month, the survey found. Analysts expect the interest rate to
end the year at 12.5 percent, before falling to 12.25 percent by
the end of 2012. Both forecasts were unchanged from the previous
week.  Consumer prices rose 6.55 percent in the year through May.
The central bank aims to slow inflation back to the mid-point of
its target in 2012. The government targets inflation of 4.5
percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Economists cut their forecast for 2011 economic growth to
3.96 percent, from 4 percent a week earlier, and held their 2012
growth forecast at 4.1 percent.  Retail sales unexpectedly fell in April for the first time
in a year, after consumers cut spending on higher fuel and food
prices.  Consumer confidence  fell to its lowest level in more
than a year in May.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2012, the most traded in Sao Paulo today, was unchanged
at 12.4 percent at 8:37 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
