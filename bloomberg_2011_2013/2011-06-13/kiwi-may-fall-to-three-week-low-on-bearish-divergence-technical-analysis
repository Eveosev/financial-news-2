New Zealand ’s dollar may fall to a
three-week low after starting to show “bearish divergence”
from a gauge of momentum, according to Forecast Pte, citing
trading patterns.  The so-called kiwi, which rose to a record versus the
greenback last week, is poised to “test” major support at its
June 3 low of 80.73 U.S. cents within a week after the bearish
signal appeared on its 14-day relative strength index chart,
said Pak Lai Ng, a technical analyst at Forecast in  Singapore .  “There’s a sharp pullback from the high” of 83.02 cents
reached on June 9, Ng said. “If it does drop below the 80.73
low, at the least it will correct the up move” from May last
year and drop toward initial support at 78.91 cents, he said.  The  New Zealand dollar  traded at 81.62 cents as of 9:34 a.m.
in Sydney after falling to 81.15 cents yesterday, the weakest
since June 3. The currency, which last traded at 78.91 cents on
May 24, has appreciated 24.4 percent from last year’s low of
65.61 cents set on May 25, 2010.  The level of support at 78.91 cents represents a 23.6
percent retracement of the kiwi’s rally from last year’s low
based on a series of numbers known as the Fibonacci sequence.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, or below support, indicates it may move
to the next level. Support refers to an areas where buy orders
may clustered. Resistance is where there may be orders to sell.  Bearish divergence occurs when the RSI starts to decline at
the same time as prices are still rising, suggesting an uptrend
may be about to end.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
