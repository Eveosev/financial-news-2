Grain planting in  Canada  is about 86
percent complete, “slightly ahead” of last year, the Canadian
Wheat Board said today. Seeding still trailed the 96 percent
normal pace for this time of year, the board said in an e-mailed
statement.  “Many farmers are now being forced to abandon significant
acreage due to excess moisture,” according to the report. Up to
8.5 centimeters (3.3 inches) of rain fell in southern areas of
the Prairies last week. The north had light showers, and “more
rain is badly needed,” the board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
