New World Resources Plc rose to its
highest in almost two weeks after Klaus-Dieter Beck, head of the
Czech coal producer’s OKD unit, said the commodity will gain as
 Germany  plans to give up nuclear power by 2022.  The stock jumped 1.7 percent to 253.2 koruna at 4:24 p.m.
in Prague, NWR’s highest close since June 1.  The decision by the  Czech Republic ’s main trading partner
to shut down nuclear stations will “substantially” change coal
pricing as the country will have to generate more electricity in
coal-fired plants, Beck told journalists in Prague today.  Europe ’s benchmark coal derivatives rose in Amsterdam to
131.75 euros per metric ton, the highest in more than a month,
after Beck’s statement. German power for next-year delivery
added 0.75 percent to 60.2 euros per megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
