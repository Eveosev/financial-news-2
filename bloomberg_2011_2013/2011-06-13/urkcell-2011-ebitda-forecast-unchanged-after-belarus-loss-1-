Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS
expects its Belarus unit BeST to post a foreign exchange loss
of $150 million to $200 million in the second quarter on
foreign currency-denominated net liabilities, following a
devaluation of the country’s local currency.  The non-cash charge at BeST is expected to have an impact
on Turkcell’s consolidated second-quarter net income,  Turkey ’s
biggest mobile-phone operator said in a statement to the
 Istanbul Stock Exchange  after the market closed on June 10.
BeST’s financial debts and other liabilities denominated in
foreign currency were $334 million as of March 31, Turkcell
said.  Forecasts for Turkcell group’s 2011 sales and earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or
Ebitda, remained unchanged, the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
