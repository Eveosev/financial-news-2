Nexen Inc. (NXY) , the Canadian oil
producer with operations in Yemen and the North Sea, said
company officials visited  Asia  seeking to establish a joint
venture to develop natural gas deposits in western  Canada .  Nexen wants to find a partner with expertise in producing
and selling liquefied natural gas, said Marvin Romanow, chief
executive officer. The Calgary-based company last month opened
the books on its shale-gas resources for review by interested
parties.  “We looked for folks with good contacts in LNG,” Romanow
said while attending the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers investor conference today.  Canadian gas producers including Encana Corp., the nation’s
largest, are seeking partners to provide cash to develop
reserves of gas trapped in shale formations, which cost more
than conventional gas. Nexen owns the rights to explore about
300,000 acres of land that could hold as much as 38 trillion
cubic feet of gas.  Nexen hasn’t drilled any new wells in Yemen and is slowing
maintenance on existing wells in that country as it awaits
renewal of its contract with the government, Romanow said. Nexen
extracts about 80,000 barrels of oil a day in Yemen and splits
the output with the government.  A drilling license for further exploration wells in the
Appomattox field in the  Gulf of Mexico  is expected soon, Romanow
said.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , which operates the field, has
regulatory approval for a five-well exploration program and is
awaiting issuance of the license.  To contact the reporter on this story:
