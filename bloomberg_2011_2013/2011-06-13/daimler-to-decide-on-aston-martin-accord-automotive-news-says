Daimler AG (DAI)  and Aston Martin will
reach a decision by July 1 on whether to cooperate in producing
Daimler’s ultra-luxury Maybach models,  Automotive News Europe 
reported today, citing Dieter Zetsche, the German company’s
chief executive officer.  Daimler is also considering closing the unit after it
failed to meet an annual sales target of 1,500 vehicles, though
cooperation is more likely, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
