(Corrects company name in eighth paragraph.)  Gold dropped to a three-week low on
sales by some investors to cover losses in equity markets.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks touched the
lowest in more than two months. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
has fallen for six straight weeks. Gold reached a record
$1,577.40 an ounce on May 2.  “Gold may tumble if margin-call problems should arise in
equities here and abroad,” said  Dennis Gartman , an economist
and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  On the Comex in  New York , gold futures for August delivery
fell $13.60, or 0.9 percent, to settle at $1,515.60 at 1:53 p.m.

active contract since May 23.  Last week, the metal dropped 0.9 percent, the first decline
since early May. The commodity has climbed 6.6 percent this

failure to overcome $1,550 last week,”  Edel Tully , a London-
based analyst at UBS AG, said in a report.  U.S. Payrolls grew at the slowest pace in eight months in
May, according to Labor Department figures released June 3.

decelerating. Crude oil fell as much as 3.2 percent today,
trading under $100 a barrel.  “People are ditching risk,” said Matt Zeman, a market
strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago . “When oil started
breaking down, it dragged everything down with it. The fact that
everything continues to point to a slowdown is a negative for
commodities.”  Commodities Rise  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities
fell as much as 1.5 percent.  Silver futures for July delivery fell $1.59, or 4.4
