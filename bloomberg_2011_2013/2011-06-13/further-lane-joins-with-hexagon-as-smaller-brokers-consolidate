Further Lane Securities LLC and
Hexagon Securities LLC are merging amid consolidation among the
smaller fixed-income brokers founded or expanded as the largest
banks struggled during 2008 and 2009.  The combined firms will operate under the Further Lane
name, said  David Castillo , the San Francisco-based head of sales
and trading at Further Lane, which focuses on securitized debt.
Nine people will join from New York-based Hexagon, bringing
total employees to about 50, he said.  The deal is “consistent with the contraction going on”
among securities firm, in which Further Lane is focusing on
“taking on good people,” Castillo said in a telephone
interview.  Wall Street’s largest banks have regained competitive
advantages lost during the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression, leading to consolidation among smaller firms.
CRT Capital Group LLC said on June 8 it had acquired the
institutional sales and trading team of Braver Stern Securities
LLC, after Institutional Financial Markets Inc., the former
Cohen & Co., said in April it would combine its capital-markets
unit with PrinceRidge Holdings LP.  Further Lane, which is based in  New York , has also added
two former partners at Fieldstone Capital Group, Carol Bunevich
and Martin Andrews, who will run a new division known as Britton
Hill that will be responsible for sales and trading in
distressed securities, according to an e-mailed statement.  “We will continue to opportunistically add talent as the
industry shrinks and adjusts to the new reality,” Further Lane
Chief Executive Officer Michael Araiz said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
