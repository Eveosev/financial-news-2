Hong Kong ’s stocks rose for the
first time in eight days after valuations reached the lowest
levels since March 2009, overshadowing government efforts to
cool the housing market.  Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd. jumped 2.8 percent, the
most in the  Hang Seng  Index, on speculation the China may select
three rare-earth companies to lead a restructuring of the
industry. China Merchants Holdings International Co. and
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. rose more than 1.3
percent.  “We’re getting to the point of a pretty oversold market
where people could start stepping in,” said  Todd Martin , Asia
equity strategist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. “People
have been talking about relative values in China and we’ve seen
two weeks of pretty heavy selling.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  climbed 0.4 percent to 22,508.08,
reversing an earlier decline of as much as 1.2 percent. The
index has lost 2.3 percent this year, pushing valuations to 12
times reported profit, the lowest level since March 2009.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’
H shares gained 0.4 percent to 12,432.84. Futures on the Hang
Seng advanced 0.7 percent to 22,420.  Hong Kong raised minimum downpayments for home buyers,
signaling no let-up in a 20-month campaign to cool prices.
Buyers of homes costing more than HK$6 million ($770,000) will
have to increase up-front payments, with properties of HK$10
million or more requiring 50 percent, Hong Kong Monetary
Authority Chief Executive  Norman Chan  told reporters on June 10.
Foreign buyers must deposit an additional 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
