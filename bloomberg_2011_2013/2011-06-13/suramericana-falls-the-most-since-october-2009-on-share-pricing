Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana,
 Colombia ’s largest holding company, fell the most since October
2008 as Grupo Nutresa SA, the country’s biggest food producer
and one of its investments, issued stock at a discounted price.  Suramericana, which holds a 37 percent stake in Nutresa,
also said on June 10 its board will seek to convert some
existing ordinary shares into stock with preferential dividend
payments.  Shares in Medellin-based Suramericana, the parent company
of Bancolombia, the country’s biggest lender, tumbled 7.2
percent to 38,920 pesos. Nutresa SA dropped 1 percent to 22,760
pesos. Shares have fallen 9 percent in three days.  “Suramericana is being hit by the Nutresa stock listing
and by their own announcement, which was very negative,” said
Juan Nicolas Pardo, head stock analyst at brokerage Valores
Colombia, in a telephone interview from Bogota. “With both of
those factors, this correction is only natural.”  Nutresa announced on June 9 that it would sell 25 million
shares for 20,900 pesos each, a 16 percent discount to the price
of the stock on the day before the announcement. The sale period
began June 10 and will last until July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
