Leopalace21 Corp. (8848) , a Japanese real
estate company, surged the most in almost seven months after
Toyo Keizai forecast earnings will surge in its quarterly
corporate handbook.  Shares of the Tokyo-based company soared 32 percent to 124
yen in  Tokyo  at the close, the most since Nov. 22, 2010. It had
the steepest increase in the Topix index, which fell 0.6 percent.  Net income for the full-year ending March 31, 2013, will
increase to 8.5 billion yen ($106 million) and sales will surge
to 510 billion yen, according to the quarterly “ Kaisha
Shikiho ” published by Toyo Keizai today, which includes data
and estimates for 3,618 Japan-listed companies. That compares
with the reported 40.1 billion yen net loss and 484 billion yen
sales for the year ended March.  “If the company’s results for next fiscal year are going
to improve that much, the current share price is cheap,” said
 Tsutomu Yamada , a market analyst at Kabu.com Securities Co. in
Tokyo. “We’ve only been hearing bad news about the company.
People are buying the shares today on next year’s outlook.”  To contact the reporter on the story:
