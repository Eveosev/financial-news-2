Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Lagavulin well west
of the U.K. Shetland Islands in the Atlantic Ocean has been
plugged and abandoned after failing to find a reservoir of oil
and gas, partner  Faroe Petroleum Plc (FPM)  said today.  Faroe, which owns 10 percent of the well that Chevron
operated, fell as much as 14.6 percent in London trading, the
most in 2 1/2 years, after the announcement. The well reached a
depth of 1,567 meters (5,000 feet) on June 10 and, while it
found some hydrocarbons, “no workable reservoir system was
found,” Faroe said. The project also took longer and was more
expensive than expected.  The Lagavulin well, the deepest yet attempted on the U.K.’s
Atlantic Margin, attracted protests from Greenpeace last year
after the disaster at BP Plc’s deepwater well in the  Gulf of
Mexico . Results are still being evaluated and will increase
explorers’ knowledge of the geology of the region, Faroe said.  “Lagavulin was a true high risk frontier exploration well,
offering material upside in a success case,” Faroe Chief
Executive Officer Graham Stewart said in a statement. “Whilst
the outcome of the well is a disappointment, the presence of
hydrocarbons has however now been proven and offers
encouragement to continue our deepwater exploration plans in the
region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
