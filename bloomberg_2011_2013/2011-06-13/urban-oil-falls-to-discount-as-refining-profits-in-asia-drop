Murban crude for sale to  Asia  traded
at a discount to its official selling price for the first time
in four months as declining profit margins reduced demand for
distillate-rich grades from the  Middle East .  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., fell 13
cents to a discount of 5 cents a barrel to its official selling
price, the lowest since Aug. 18, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Qatar Marine slid 15 cents to a discount of 33 cents,
Bloomberg data show.  Refiners may be reducing purchases of distillate-rich
Middle East grades as profits from making gasoil, or diesel,
have fallen 13.5 percent since climbing to the highest in nearly
2 1/2 years in mid-March. Gasoilâ€™s premium to Dubai crude was at
$20.91 a barrel today, according to data from PVM Oil Associates
Ltd, a London-based broker.  Oman futures for August delivery climbed 22 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $111.82 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange ,
with 924 contracts traded. The settlement price was at $111.79
at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July widened 9 cents
to $7.63 a barrel, data from London-based broker PVM Oil
Associates showed. The exchange for swaps for August climbed 7
cents to $7.09 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
