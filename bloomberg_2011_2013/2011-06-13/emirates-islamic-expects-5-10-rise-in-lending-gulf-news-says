Emirates Islamic Bank PJSC expects
its Islamic financing business to increase by 5 percent to 10
percent this year,  Gulf News reported , citing Faisal Aqil, the
Dubai-based bankâ€™s acting deputy chief executive officer.  The rise will be driven by an increase in financing to
small and medium-sized businesses and to large companies, the
Dubai-based daily said, citing Aqil. Provisions for bad loans
have peaked and will decline, according to Aqil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
