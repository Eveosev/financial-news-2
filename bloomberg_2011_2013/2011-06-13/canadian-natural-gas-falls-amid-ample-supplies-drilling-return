Canadian natural gas fell as U.S.
production rose and drilling rigs returned to Canadian fields
following the spring melt.  Gas declined 3.6 percent as the number of rigs working in
western  Canada  increased by 26 to 217 in the week ended June 3,
according to the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling
Contractors. Gas exploration has shifted from shallow wells in
southern Alberta to extracting gas trapped in shale in the
Northwest, said Don Herring, president of the association.  “Some guys are still drilling for gas,” he said. “There
will always be some drilling for pipeline requirement and the
focus of the shale gas is liquids.”  Alberta gas for July delivery tumbled 14.75 cents to
C$3.91 per gigajoule ($3.79 per million British thermal units)
as of 1:53 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian
Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users
in Canada and the U.S., and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s
 Alberta  system.  Gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
dropped 11 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $4.647 per million Btu as
of 1:54 p.m.  TransCanada Volume  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.6 billion cubic
feet as of 12:30 p.m. in New York, 235 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.52 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.45 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 595 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.42 billion cubic feet today, about 70 percent of its
capacity of 2.02 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.09
billion cubic feet at 12:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
