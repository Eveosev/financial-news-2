Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
German maker of luxury cars, will postpone the release of a
smaller and lighter version of its Mini model as production
costs are too high,  Automobilwoche  reported today, without
saying where it got the information.  The car, called Rocketman, was presented at the Geneva auto
show in March, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
