European stocks climbed, as the
benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rebounded from a 2 1/2
month low last week. U.S. futures also rose, while Asian shares
dropped.  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. jumped 4.5 percent after a
report that Glencore International Plc may make a 12 billion-
pound ($19.5 billion) bid for the metals producer. Invensys Plc
rose 1.1 percent on a report that the company may sell its
pension program. Imperial Tobacco Group Plc decreased 1.3
percent after the company said profit may be reduced in  Spain .  The Stoxx 600 gained 0.3 percent to 268.83 at 8:43 a.m. in
 London  after the benchmark measure last week slid 2 percent. The
gauge had retreated for six consecutive weeks, the longest
stretch of losses since 2008, as U.S. economic data trailed
forecasts and speculation grew that  Greece  will default on its
debt, adding to concern that the global recovery is faltering.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
