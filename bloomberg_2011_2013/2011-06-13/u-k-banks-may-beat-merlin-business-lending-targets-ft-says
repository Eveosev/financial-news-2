The U.K.’s largest banks may beat
actual lending targets set out in the so-called Project Merlin
agreement signed between the banks and the government in
February, the Financial Times reported, citing figures disclosed
last week by Minister for Business and Enterprise Mark Prisk.  The agreement’s targets, labeled “stretch targets,” are
about 10 percent lower than the official “capacity targets”
published in the Merlin announcement, the FT said. The “stretch
target” for total corporate lending in 2011 is 168 billion
pounds ($273 billion) compared with a “capacity target” of 190
billion pounds, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
