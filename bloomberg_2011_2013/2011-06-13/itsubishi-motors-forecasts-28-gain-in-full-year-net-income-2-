Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) , maker of
the i-MiEV electric car, forecast full-year profit may rise 28
percent on higher overseas sales.  Net income may increase to 20 billion yen ($248 million) in
the 12 months ending March 31 from 15.6 billion yen a year
earlier, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement today.
Revenue may climb to 1.95 trillion yen from 1.83 trillion yen,
the Tokyo-based company said.  Global vehicle sales including the cars made for
Mitsubishi’s joint venture brands may rise to 1.17 million from
1.09 million units last year, Mitsubishi said in the statement.
Sales in the Asia-Pacific region and emerging markets, excluding
Japan, are projected to gain 13 percent to 576,000 vehicles, or
almost half of the automaker’s total worldwide sales.  Mitsubishi Motors postponed its profit forecast from April
27, citing the impact on production from  Japan ’s record
earthquake in March. The automaker estimated it lost output of
35,000 vehicles from March 14 to April 30, according to Kai Inada, a company spokesman.  Operating profit in the year started April 1 may rise to 50
billion yen from 40.3 billion yen, the company said.  Mitsubishi Motors shares were unchanged at 94 yen at the 3
p.m. close of trading in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
