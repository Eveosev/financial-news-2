Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial (600887) 
Group Co. fell the most in more than two years in Shanghai
trading after accusations of  insider trading  by the company’s
chairman were posted on the internet. The dairy company,
China’s second-biggest, said the reports were groundless and
that it’s reported the matter to the police.  The stock fell by the 10 percent daily limit to 16.28 yuan
in Shanghai today, the biggest one-day drop since November 2008.
China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.2 percent.  Online accusations of insider trading posted by a person
claiming to be a former Yili employee led to the stock’s
decline, said Zhang Lu, an analyst at CSC Securities HK Ltd.,
and Xu Hao, an analyst at Guodu Securities Co. Yili said on its
website today that the accusations were “groundless slander.”  Su Yufeng, a spokesman for Yili, said by telephone today
that the company has reported the incident to the police.  --Emma Dong. Editors:  John Liu , Frank Longid  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
