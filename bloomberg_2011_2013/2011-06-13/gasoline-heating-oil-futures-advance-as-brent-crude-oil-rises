Gasoline futures fluctuated,
reversing an earlier increase, as Brent crude oil in  London 
retreated from its highs.  Prices swung between gains and losses as European benchmark
Brent’s premium over the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
narrowed after earlier reaching a record. Refineries on the East
Coast, where  New York  Mercantile Exchange gasoline futures are
delivered, primarily process oil from Europe and West Africa,
which are priced versus Brent.  “There’s a little bit of a pullback in Brent, and the
products are more inclined to follow Brent,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York
and a trader at the Nymex.  Gasoline for July delivery was unchanged at $3.0177 a
gallon at 11:01 a.m. on the Nymex. Prices swung between $2.9988
and $3.0518.  The WTI-Brent spread, based on July futures traded on Nymex
and ICE Futures  Europe , was $21.08 a barrel, up from $19.49 on
June 10. The spread touched a record $21.58.  “Brent is rallying as the benchmark for European oil,
which is being affected by turmoil in Syria, Yemen and  Libya ,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston.  The premiums for heating oil and gasoline over WTI also
widened as Brent strengthened. The July gasoline crack spread on
Nymex gained 87 cents to $28.32 a barrel and heating oil
increased $1.57 to $32.69 a barrel, the widest gap since May
2008.  Regular gasoline at the pump fell 0.5 cents to $3.703
yesterday, according to AAA data on its website, the lowest
level since April 4.  Heating oil for July delivery rose 1.39 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.119 a gallon, after touching $3.1356 a gallon on
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
