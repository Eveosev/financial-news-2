Treasury 10-year yields were six
basis points from this year’s low before a report that
economists say will show U.S. retail sales dropped for the first
time in 11 months.  Two-year yields were set for the biggest quarterly drop in
more than two years on prospects Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will signal tomorrow the central bank will maintain
easing measures. The Fed will buy $4 billion to $5 billion in
Treasuries today maturing in August 2018 to May 2021 as part of
its $600 billion bond-purchase program that ends this month.  “Treasuries have yet to fully price in an economic
slowdown,” said Shinichiro Kadota, a non-yen strategist in
 Tokyo  at  Barclays Capital , one of the 20 primary dealers
authorized to trade directly with the Fed. Ten-year yields
“have room to fall toward 2.9 percent by the end of
September.”  Yields on 10-year notes were little changed at 2.98 percent
as of 9:11 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 3.125 percent security maturing in May 2021 fell
1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 101 9/32. The
yields reached 2.92 percent on June 9, the lowest since Dec. 3.  Two-year yields have declined 42 basis points since March
31, poised for the biggest quarterly drop since the period ended
December 2008.  Retail sales in the U.S. dropped 0.5 percent in May, the
first decrease since June 2010, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the data
tomorrow.  Bernanke said on June 7 that record monetary stimulus is
still needed to boost a “frustratingly slow” recovery. The
central bank will continue reinvesting proceeds from agency and
mortgage-backed holdings into Treasuries after the end of its
$600 billion bond-buying program this month.  Bernanke is set to speak on fiscal sustainability in
 Washington  tomorrow. Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker is
scheduled to speak today in Roanoke, Virginia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
