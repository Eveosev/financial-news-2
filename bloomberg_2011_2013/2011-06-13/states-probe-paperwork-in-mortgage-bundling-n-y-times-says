Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  and
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , two of the largest firms serving as trustees
for mortgage bundling, have received information requests from
two state attorneys general investigating the validity of
paperwork related to the securities, the New York Times said.  New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman and his
Delaware counterpart, Joseph R. Biden III, are leading the
probe, the Times reported. The two, whose states’ laws governed
the creation of most of the trusts, are focusing on the “back
end of mortgage assembly lines,” where banks oversee securities
for investors, the newspaper said, citing two unidentified
people briefed on the inquiry.  Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, and  Michael Golden , a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in  London , declined to
comment.  The investigation follows others focused on mortgage
industry practices before and after the U.S. housing boom and
its collapse. Lenders in recent months have been criticized for
mortgage foreclosure practices caused by poor paperwork and
administrative practices, the newspaper reported.  Trustees may be liable for breaching their duties to
investors who bought the securities if they didn’t follow rules
set in prospectuses, according to the New York Times. That could
expose the banks to costly civil litigation, it said.  Unidentified spokesmen for the banks and the offices of
Biden and Schneiderman declined to comment on the investigation,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
