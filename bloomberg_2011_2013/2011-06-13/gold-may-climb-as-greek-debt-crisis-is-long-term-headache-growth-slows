Gold may climb as investors seek to
preserve their wealth against the sovereign-debt crisis in
 Europe  and slowing growth in the U.S. and  China .  Immediate-delivery gold was little changed at $1,530.30 an
ounce at 2:42 p.m. in  Singapore . Gold for August delivery added
0.1 percent to $1,531 an ounce. Cash silver declined 0.6 percent
to $35.96 an ounce.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  and
German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  are at odds over
investors’ role in the second Greek rescue in 14 months. U.S.
retail sales probably fell in May for the first time in 11
months as car buying eased, according to a survey of economists
ahead of a June 14 report. A separate report tomorrow may show
China’s industrial production slowed.  “Europe’s debt crisis remains a long-term headache and we
continue to believe that gold has to move much higher from the
current level,” said Hwang Il Doo, a Seoul-based senior trader
at KEB Futures Co.  Unless a deal can be struck to guarantee  Greece ’s financing
needs for the next 12 months, the  International Monetary Fund 
has threatened to withhold its share of what remains of Greece’s
original 110 billion-euro ($159 billion) bailout. Thirteen of 19,
or 68 percent, of traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg said bullion will rise this week. Five predicted lower
prices and one was neutral.  Concern about faster inflation, Europe’s debt crisis, a
weakening dollar and fighting in  Libya  boosted gold to a record
$1,577.57 on May 2. The price has gained 7.7 percent this year
after climbing for the past 10 years, the longest run of gains
for the precious metal in at least nine decades.  Hedge Funds  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long position in New York gold futures in the week
ended June 7, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Speculative long positions outnumbered short positions by
198,708 contracts on the Comex division of the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the Washington-based commission said in its
Commitments of Traders report. Net-long positions rose by 6,934
contracts, or 4 percent, from a week earlier. Long positions are
bets on higher prices, while short positions are the reverse.  “A sustained breach of $1,550 is needed before gold can
muster sufficient momentum to continue on its longer term
uptrend,” Ong Yi Ling, Singapore-based analyst with Phillip
Futures Pte Ltd. “Until then, gold could be range-bound with
support established at $1,525.”  Spot palladium dropped 0.2 percent to $811.5 an ounce,
while platinum was little changed at $1,828 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
