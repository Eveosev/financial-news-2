The Polish zloty advanced for a
third day on expectations that the planned sale of Jastrzebska
Spolka Weglowa SA, the European Union’s largest coking-coal
producer, will boost demand for the currency and help finance
the budget deficit.  The zloty advanced 0.2 percent to 3.9307 per euro as of
3:26 p.m. in Warsaw. It has strengthened 0.5 percent in a three-
day rally reach a three-week intraday high.  Poland’s Treasury Ministry today set the maximum value in
the initial public offering for the company known as JSW at 5.77
billion zloty ($2.1 billion). JSW’s sale comes after the
government last week sold a $1.2 billion stake in PZU SA, the
country’s largest insurer.  “The government will finalize the sale of JSW at the end
of June, which should generate a similar flow and help the
zloty,” ING Bank Slaski SA economists led by Mateusz Szczurek
in Warsaw. The zloty may strengthen beyond 3.9250 against the
European common currency and “test” the 3.89 level, they
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
