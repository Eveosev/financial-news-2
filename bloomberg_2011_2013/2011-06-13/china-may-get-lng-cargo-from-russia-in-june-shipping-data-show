China  may receive a spot cargo of
liquefied natural gas from  Russia  this month, according to ship-
tracking data.  China National Offshore Oil Corp.’s Fujian terminal may get
the fuel on June 15 on the Neva River, a 145,394 cubic-meter
tanker, possibly from the Sakhalin LNG project, according to
ship transmissions captured today by AISLive on Bloomberg.  China more than doubled imports of natural gas to 2.6
billion cubic meters in May from a year earlier, with half of
them through a pipeline from Central Asia and the rest in liquid
form, the National Development and Reform Commission said on its
website, citing preliminary data.  The Fujian LNG terminal has a long-term contract with
 Indonesia ’s Tangguh LNG plant to receive the fuel, according to
the company’s website.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
