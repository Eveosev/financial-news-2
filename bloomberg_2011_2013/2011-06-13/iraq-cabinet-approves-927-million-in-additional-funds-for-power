Iraq , struggling to limit summer
power outages, approved $927 million in additional funding for
the Electricity Ministry, State Minister Ali al-Dabbagh said.  “The government is determined to support an important and
vital sector,” Dabbagh said in an e-mailed statement. The
budget supplement will cover “strategic projects” for
electricity generation, equipment and the supply of imported
natural gas as fuel for power stations to increase output
capacity, he said.  The ministry has asked for a separate sum of $100 million
more to pay for natural-gas imports from neighboring  Iran  to
supply Iraqi power plants, Dabbagh said. Iraq signed an
agreement last month to import 25 million cubic meters a day of
Iranian gas.  Iraq’s power stations and distribution network have
suffered from decades of conflict, sanctions and sabotage, and
the country still faces shortages eight years after the U.S.-led
invasion that ousted President  Saddam Hussein . The country
sought bids this year for the construction of more than 60  power
plants  that would add 14,000 megawatts to the grid.  Iraq produces 7,000 megawatts and imports 1,000 megawatts,
while domestic demand totals about 14,000 megawatts, Iraqi
Electricity Minister Raad Shallal said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
