Japanese stocks declined, sending
the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average to its first drop in a week, amid
concern that the global economic recovery is slowing.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Japan ’s largest company by sales, lost
2.4 percent after the automaker said profit will fall almost a
third this year following March’s record earthquake. Bridgestone
Corp., Japan’s No. 1 tiremaker by market value, sank 2.5 percent.
 Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s biggest oil explorer by sales, slid 1.7
percent after  oil prices  declined.  “Downward pressure on stocks is building -- make no
mistake about it,” said Hideo Arimura, who helps oversee about
$2.2 billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “The
consensus is bearish. There’s no good news coming out.”  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.7 percent to 9,448.21 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , the gauge’s first decline since June 6. The
broader Topix lost 0.6 percent to 812.26, with about three
shares dropping for every two that gained. The index has tumbled
13 percent since March 10, the day before a magnitude-9
earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s northeast coast,
triggering the worst nuclear accident in 25 years, disrupting
supply chains, and leaving almost 24,000 people dead or missing.  Toyota sank 2.4 percent to 3,220 yen after the company
forecast a 31 percent drop in profit this year, citing
production cuts because of quake damage and a stronger yen. Net
income at the automaker may fall to 280 billion yen ($3.5
billion) in the 12 months ending March 31 from 408 billion yen a
year earlier, the company said in a statement on June 10 after
markets closed. Honda Motor Co. lost 2.5 percent to 2,911 yen
and Nissan Motor Co. slid 1.1 percent to 784 yen.  Machinery Orders  　　　　Manufacturers of tires and other rubber products fell the
most among the 33 Topix industry groups, followed by carmakers
and oil-related companies. Bridgestone sank 2.5 percent to 1,801
yen. Rival Sumitomo Rubber Industries slid 1.9 percent to 961
yen, while Yokohama Rubber Co. dropped 1.4 percent to 433 yen.  Japanese machinery orders fell for the first time in four
months in April, an indication that companies are reluctant to
spend following the earthquake disaster. Factory orders fell 3.3
percent in April from March, the Cabinet Office said today in
Tokyo. Orders, an indicator of  capital spending  in three to six
months, were expected to rise 1.7 percent, according to the
median forecast of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Inpex Drops  Oil companies  declined after crude fell the most in a month.
Inpex fell 1.7 percent to 578,000 yen and Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co., the nation’s second-largest oil explorer by
revenue, slumped 1.7 percent to 3,835 yen.  Crude prices declined for a second day in  New York  before
reports tomorrow that may show slowing economic growth in the
U.S. and China, curbing fuel demand in the world’s two largest
crude consumers.  Oil futures slid as much as 0.7 percent, after the biggest
single-session drop in four weeks on June 10. Sales at U.S.
retailers probably fell in May for the first time in 11 months
and  China ’s industrial production slowed, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the crippled
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, was the most actively traded
stock by value in Japan. The utility rallied 4.7 percent to
close at 199 yen, after falling as much as 6.3 percent  To contact the reporter on this story:
