U.S. stocks pared gains, following
the longest weekly Dow Jones Industrial Average slump since
2002, as falling commodity prices dragged down energy and raw
material producers.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,271.26 at 12:01 p.m. in  New York . The measure climbed as
much as 0.5 percent earlier. The Dow advanced 14.38 points, or
0.1 percent, to 11,966.29.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
