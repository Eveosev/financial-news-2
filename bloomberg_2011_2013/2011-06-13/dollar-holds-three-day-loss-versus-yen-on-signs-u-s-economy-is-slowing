The yen and dollar fell against the
Australian dollar and South African rand after reports showed
 China ’s retail sales and industrial output increased, spurring
demand for higher-yielding assets including stocks.  The Swiss franc dropped versus all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg as the government lowered its
forecast for 2012 economic growth and said further currency
appreciation poses risks to its outlook. The greenback decreased
against the euro for a second consecutive day before government
figures forecast to show retail sales fell.  “Equities are looking pretty well bid as risk appetite has
perked up a bit,” said Paul Bednarczyk, a currency strategist
at 4Cast Ltd. in London. “That’s causing a bit of bargain
hunting in the likes of high yielders like the Aussie.”  The yen traded at 115.78 versus the euro at 7:37 a.m. in
 New York , compared with 115.65 yesterday, when it reached
114.86, the strongest level since May 27. The yen was little
changed at 80.21 versus the dollar, compared with 80.24. The
dollar slid 0.2 percent to $1.4437 per euro, from $1.4413.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares climbed 1.1 percent
after a drop of as much as 0.2 percent, while the Stoxx Europe
600 Index rose 0.8 percent.  Australia ’s dollar increased 0.4 percent to $1.0639 and
advanced 0.3 percent to 85.29 yen. South Africa’s rand
appreciated 0.3 percent to 6.7695 versus the dollar and gained
0.2 percent to 11.85 yen.  Carry Trades  Under carry trades, investors borrow where  interest
rates  are low to buy higher-yielding assets elsewhere. Benchmark
rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and 5.5 percent in  South
Africa .  China’s retail sales rose 16.9 percent last month, while
industrial production increased more than economists forecast,
the statistics bureau reported. The 5.5 percent increase in
China’s consumer-price index was the fastest in almost three
years. Lenders were ordered to set aside more cash as reserves.  Today’s data offset concern the fastest-growing major
economy is cooling. New loans in China tumbled in May and  money
supply  grew at the slowest pace since 2008, the central bank
reported yesterday.  The Bank of  Japan  kept the benchmark overnight rate in a
range of zero to 0.1 percent and left unchanged its 30 trillion
yen ($370 billion) lending facility and 10 trillion yen asset-
buying program.  The central bank also announced a 500 billion yen
plan to make loans available to companies at 0.1 percent
interest for two years, a move aimed at revitalizing an
earthquake-hit economy by directing funds to industries.  U.S. Retail Sales  The dollar dropped against the euro before a report
forecast to show retail sales dropped 0.5 percent in May in what
would be the first decrease in 11 months, according to the
median forecast of 81 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before today’s report from the Commerce Department.  The Swiss franc slid 0.5 percent to 1.21287 against the
euro as the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs said gross
domestic product will rise 1.5 percent next year instead of the
1.9 percent projected in March.  “Economic growth in  Switzerland  has been solid so far,”
the state secretariat said. “However, the currency
appreciation, which already represented a burden on Swiss
exports the last few months, has jumped even higher over the
last few weeks. With the recent added strength to the franc, new
risks have emerged.”  Strength of Franc  The franc appreciated yesterday to a record 1.2004 against
the euro. The Swiss currency declined today to 83.90 centimes
against the dollar.  Gains in the euro may have been limited on concern European
Union finance ministers meeting today will struggle to resolve
the Greek debt crisis.  Standard & Poor’s  lowered its long-term sovereign credit
ratings on  Greece  three levels to CCC yesterday. The outlook on
the long-term ratings is negative.  Luxembourg’s Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads
the group of euro-area finance ministers, said in an interview
on Radio Berlin-Brandenburg on June 11 that any bailout for
Greece must include “voluntary” investor participation.  Credit-default swaps on Greece jumped 41 basis points to a
record high of 1,604 yesterday, according to CMA. The swaps are
benchmarks for protecting bonds against default and traders use
them to speculate on  credit quality . A drop signals improving
perceptions of creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the
opposite.  To contact the reporters on this story:
