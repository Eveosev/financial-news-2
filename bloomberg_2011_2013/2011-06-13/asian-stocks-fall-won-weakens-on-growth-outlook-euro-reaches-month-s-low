U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index rebounding from an almost three-month low, as
a pickup in takeovers overshadowed concern the economic rebound
is slowing. Oil retreated, while Treasuries were little changed.  The  S&P 500  climbed 0.5 percent to 1,276.68 at 2:08 p.m. in
 New York  and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.2 percent. Crude
slid 2.1 percent to $97.18 a barrel. Greek, Portuguese and
Spanish bonds fell and the cost of European government debt-
default insurance rose for a sixth day as leaders remained at
odds over investors’ role in a second rescue package for  Greece .
Ten-year Treasury yields rose one basis point to 2.98 percent.  Equities rebounded today after a six-week slide, the
longest slump in almost three years, left the S&P 500 trading at
its cheapest compared with forecast earnings since last summer.
 Transatlantic Holdings Inc. (TRH) , the reinsurer formerly owned by
American International Group Inc., surged after agreeing to
merge with Switzerland’s Allied World Assurance Company Holdings
AG.  Timberland Co. (TBL)  rallied as  VF Corp. (VFC)  said it will buy the
maker of outdoor clothing and footwear.  “M&A always helps the market; we haven’t had too many
merger Mondays lately,” said  Richard Sichel , who oversees $1.6
billion as chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co.
“It’s time to take a look at stocks again for people who’ve
been on the sidelines. Valuations are looking attractive and we
still believe that there’s a good chance company earnings will
continue to surprise on the upside.”  Tumble From April  The S&P 500 tumbled 6.8 percent from an almost three-year
high at the end of April through last week as data on
employment, manufacturing and housing trailed economists’
estimates. The slide left the index trading at 12.8 times
estimated earnings for 2011 and 12.1 times forecasts for the
next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Telephone companies and financial firms led gains in eight
of 10 industry groups in the S&P 500 today. Timberland rallied
43 percent, the most since at least 1987, after VF agreed to buy
the company for about $1.8 billion. VF, the world’s largest
apparel maker, surged 10 percent. Transatlantic Holdings climbed
10 percent after agreeing to the $3.2 billion deal that will
create a reinsurer with operations in 18 countries.  About $1.1 trillion in mergers and acquisitions has been
announced globally so far in 2011, 23 percent more than during
the same period last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Stoxx 600’s gain followed a six-week stretch of
declines, its longest slump since July 2008. Eurasian Natural
Resources Corp. rallied 4.7 after the Sunday Times said Glencore
International Plc may make a 12 billion-pound ($20 billion) bid
for the mining company. Markets in  Switzerland ,  Norway ,
 Luxembourg , Austria, Denmark, Iceland and Greece are closed for
