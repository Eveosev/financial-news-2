Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) , the
owner of cable television’s Animal Planet and  Discovery Channel ,
sold $650 million of debt that may be used for stock buybacks,
acquisitions, debt refinancing and  capital expenditures .  The company initially marketed $500 million of notes, said
a person with knowledge of the transaction, who declined to be
identified citing lack of authorization to speak publicly. The
4.375 percent notes yield 150 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Discovery tapped the  bond market  for the first time since
May 2010 as the  Silver Spring , Maryland-based company takes
advantage of investment-grade yields at about the lowest since
November. The company, which spent $167 million buying back
common stock in the first quarter, will “likely increase the
rate of our repurchase activities in the future,” Chief
Financial Officer Brad Singer said on an April 28 earnings call.  “Based on where we are today, you will see us deploy more
capital at a higher level as we move through the year than we
have in the past,” Singer said on the call.  Discovery bought $48 million of shares between April 1 and
April 27, bringing buybacks to $320 million under its $1 billion
stock repurchase program, according to an April 28 statement.  Eaton Bonds  Discovery’s new senior notes will add to $3.62 billion of
net debt, Discovery said today in a regulatory filing.  Eaton Corp. (ETN) , a maker of circuit breakers and truck
transmissions, joined Discovery in selling debt today, as
investment-grade yields tumbled to 3.72 percent on June 10,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Yields
reached 3.68 percent on June 1, the lowest since Nov. 11.  Eaton sold $300 million of senior unsecured three-year
floating-rate notes at par to yield 33 basis points more than
the three-month London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data
show. Three-month Libor, a lending benchmark for banks, was set
at 0.247 percent today.  Discovery sold $3 billion of debt in three parts in its
previous offering, which included $1.3 billion of 5.05 percent,
10-year notes, Bloomberg data show.  The 10-year notes, which yielded 190 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, traded at 106.5 cents on the dollar
on June 6 to yield 4.18 percent, or a spread of 114 basis
points, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Discovery, which saw first-quarter revenue jump to $951
million, a 9 percent increase from a year earlier, according to
the statement. The company plans to have more than $1 billion of
free  cash flow  this year, Chief Executive Officer and President
David Zaslav said on the earnings call.  Discovery is rated BBB by  Standard & Poor’s  and its senior
bonds are graded Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
