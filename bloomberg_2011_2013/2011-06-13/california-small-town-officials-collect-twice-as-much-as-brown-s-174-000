Robert Gutierrez got $459,468 in
salary and severance in 2009 as city manager of Moreno Valley, a
suburb with 450 employees and 193,000 residents an hour east of
 Los Angeles . That’s twice the  salary  of the governor,
responsible for  353,000 employees  and 37 million people.  Gutierrez wasn’t alone. Almost four in 10 city managers in
 California  were paid more than the state’s chief executive in
2009, according to payroll data. The top 10 shared $4.7 million
including bonuses and allowances to oversee cities averaging
115,000, the data shows. Eighty-five managers that year were
paid $250,000 or more.  “It’s outrageous,” said Deanna Reeder, 49, who lives in
Moreno Valley, which had per capita income of  $18,728  in 2009
and an April unemployment rate of  15.6 percent .
“California is hurting. Every city is hurting and instead of
dealing with it, they overpay some people, and the person they
are overpaying doesn’t solve the problems.”  The pay of  municipal executives  has come under scrutiny in
the wake of a scandal in the Los Angeles suburb of Bell, where
the city manager,  Robert Rizzo , paid himself $1.17 million in
2009 to run a city of 38,000.  “If you pay someone $400,000 and they fixed the problems
of your city, maybe you could appreciate that,” Reeder said in
a telephone interview. “But the problems in our cities aren’t
going away.”  The median salary for California’s city managers in 2009
was $187,728, according to data from the state controller’s
office. The governor’s salary was $212,179, which  Arnold Schwarzenegger  declined to accept. The salary was lowered to
$173,987 in December of that year.  ‘Very Frustrating’  “We all do our jobs because we believe strongly in public
service,” said Dana Shigley, city manager of Anderson, a
community of 10,800 north of Sacramento, who was paid $119,500
in 2009. “It’s very frustrating for 99 percent of the city
managers in this state to see 1 percent of the managers out
there get greedy and sacrifice their integrity and ethics for
personal gain. It makes us all look bad.”  California’s 1.75 million local government workers were
paid $94.7 billion in wages and salaries in 2009, or an average
of $54,197, according to the U.S.  Commerce Department .  Gutierrez retired at the end of 2009 with a $17,354-a-month
pension after pleading no contest to  identity theft , computer
fraud and harassment charges, according to pension fund and
court records. The $459,468 he grossed that year included his
base salary of $274,500 and a $183,366 severance package,
according to a pay survey conducted by the League of California
Cities.  Gutierrez’s lawyer in the criminal case, David Goldstein,
didn’t return multiple calls for comment over several days. No
active phone number could be located for Gutierrez at the La
Verne home listed in court and property records.  ‘No Control’  “I don’t believe the taxpayers of Moreno Valley got their
money’s worth,” said City Councilwoman Robin Hastings, who
wasn’t in office when Gutierrez worked out his job agreement.
“Due to the shortsighted terms of the contract approved by the
previous City Council, when Mr. Gutierrez’s departure occurred,
the city had no control over how much he received.”  Moreno Valley awarded Gutierrez’s replacement, Henry Garcia, a $302,400 base salary plus benefits and allowances,
according to his contract.  The city has been forced to cut its staff by 25 percent in
the last three years as it grappled with a combined budget
shortfall of $30 million in the period.  City managers often get perks valued at as much as $10,000,
such as a free car and mobile phone, and housing allowances,
according to the league of cities survey. Most also can cash in
unused vacation and sick leave. When Beverly Hills City Manager
Roderick Wood retired in 2009, he collected $140,000 that way,
according to the survey.  Compensation Consultants  Moreno Valley’s compensation consultants said city manager
pay is usually based on population and the size of the budget,
according to Mayor Richard Stewart.  “It’s the demand of the marketplace,” Stewart said in a
telephone interview. “No one is going to take a new job with a
pay cut.”  Josh Barro, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy
Research in  New York , said city governments are large and
complex organizations, and similar management positions in the
private sector would also be well-paid.  “It is important to pay competitively to attract
managerial talent,” he said in an e-mail. “Obviously, the pay
packages in Bell were indefensible. I’m sure some other
individual jurisdictions are overpaying. But the aggregate pay
levels you describe here do not set off alarm bells for me.”  Driving Down Salaries  The Bell scandal and revenue pressures on local governments
have combined to drive down salaries for city and county
administrators, said Bob Murray, a municipal recruiter in
suburban Sacramento.  Bob Murray & Associates  has conducted
searches for cities, counties and special districts in
California, Georgia and  Florida , among other states.  “Every city manager search I’ve done since last year, the
council is looking to pay the new city manager less than the
previous city manager,” Murray said.  Although managers don’t expect to get rich -- “except
maybe Bob Rizzo” -- reducing wages and benefits ultimately will
dry up the talent pool, Murray said. Assistant city managers
won’t seek the top jobs for a lateral wage, and managers won’t
leave for a new city without a raise, he said.  Seven Years  The average city manager stays in the job seven years, up
slightly from before the 2008 recession, said Michele Frisby,
spokeswoman for the  International City/County Management
Association , a 9,000-member group that’s conducting a national
pay survey as a consequence of the Bell scandal.  Although some cities have experimented with sharing city
managers with neighbors, most kept their existing structure,
Frisby said.  “We’re not seeing that much of an impact as a result of
the recession,” she said. “Many cities are grateful to have a
professional manager to steer them through the financial
crisis.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
