New York state’s fiscal picture is
brightening as “difficult” cuts to school aid and a move to
cap Medicaid spending growth in this year’s $132.5 billion
budget may lead to long-term balanced budgets,  Standard & Poor’s 
said in a report.  New York’s spending plan for the fiscal year that began
April 1 closed a $10 billion deficit and included a $100 million
deposit to its “rainy day” fund, the first new addition since
2008, S&P said.  “The near timely passage of this budget reflects a new
legislative consensus on implementing difficult budget cuts and
moving toward long-term structural balance,” the report said.  Governor  Andrew Cuomo  and the Legislature approved a plan
that cut school aid by $1.3 billion, while allowing a temporary
income-tax surcharge to expire. The budget limits future
education spending increases to the average growth in state
personal income. Medicaid, the federal-state health-insurance
program for the poor, was capped at $15.3 billion in 2012.  Since Cuomo took office in January, the cost to protect $10
million of  New York  debt maturing in 10 years against default
has fallen to about $113,000 from $214,000, according to data
compiled by CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.  New York estimates that cuts represented 85 percent of its
actions to close the deficit. The state is projecting a $2.4
billion deficit next year, compared with an expected $14.9
billion gap before the budget was passed.  S&P assigns a AA rating, its third-highest investment
grade, to New York’s general obligation bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
