The Georgian government expects
 foreign direct investment  to double this year, after falling 65
percent the past two years, Economy Minister Vera Kobalia said.  Georgia may receive more than $1 billion of investment,
mainly in hydropower projects, Kobalia said in an interview late
yesterday in Tbilisi, the capital. Tourism will also lure
investors after more than 2 million people visited the former
Soviet republic last year, the most since 2003, when President
Mikheil Saakashvili took power in the so-called Rose Revolution.  Foreign direct investment fell to $553.1 million last year
from $658.4 million in 2009 and $1.56 billion in 2008, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Our goal is to double last year’s FDI results,” Kobalia
said. “We are going to see better numbers.”  Georgia  has signed 42 agreements to develop hydropower
projects as the Black Sea country seeks to attract $5 billion to
reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Moscow-based Inter RAO UES,
Turkish builder Kolin Insaat, and a venture between Solon, Ohio-
based Robbins Co. and Georgia’s Peri Ltd. are among the
companies that have signed deals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
