The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 1.5 basis points to 115 as of 8:30
a.m. in Beijing, according to Credit Agricole CIB prices. The
index is on track for its highest close since March 23,
according to data from CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
115, as of 10:30 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show.
The index is on track for its highest close since March 17,
according to CMA data.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was unchanged at 135.5 basis
points as of 9:30 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  --  Henry Sanderson . Editor: Hugh Chow  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
