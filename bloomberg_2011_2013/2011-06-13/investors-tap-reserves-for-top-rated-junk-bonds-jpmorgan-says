Investors in  Europe  are using cash
reserves to add to holdings of top-rated high-yield bonds,
according to a  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  survey of money managers.  More than 70 percent of investors say they are overweight
junk debt, meaning they hold more of it as a proportion of their
portfolio than indicated by the indexes they follow, the survey
showed. Just 14 percent are underweight and an equal number are
neutral. That compares to more than half saying they were
neutral in April, JPMorgan said.  While investors are increasing their holdings of the
securities overall, they are steering clear of the lowest-rated
bonds, with just 14 percent overweight CCC categories, down from
29 percent in the previous survey, according to London-based
strategists Daniel Lamy, Stephen Dulake and Tina T. Zhang.  Cash holdings at 72 percent of respondents are “average,”
with only 15 percent reporting low or very low cash holdings,
according to JPMorgan.  High yield, or junk, bonds are rated lower than BBB- at
 Standard & Poor’s  and Baa3 at Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
