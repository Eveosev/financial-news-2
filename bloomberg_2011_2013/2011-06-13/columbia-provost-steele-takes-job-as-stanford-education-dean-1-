Columbia University Provost Claude Steele, the second-ranking officer at the college in New York,
is stepping down to take a job at  Stanford University .  Steele, who came to Columbia from Stanford in 2009, is
returning to become dean of the School of Education at the
university near Palo Alto,  California , he said in an e-mail to
Columbia faculty and students. He starts later this year.  Steele, 65, is a psychologist and the first black provost
of Columbia. He spent 18 years at Stanford, where he was
director of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences, before leaving for Columbia. The Stanford position is
a chance to help shape education policy “at this critical time
in our nation’s history,” Steele said in the e-mail.  “It is an important time to be rejoining that vital
mission,” Steele said. “Nothing less than this rare
opportunity to do so at such a strong school of education could
have lured me away from my current position at Columbia.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
