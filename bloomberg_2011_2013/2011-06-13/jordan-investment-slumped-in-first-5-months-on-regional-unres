Investment in  Jordan  decreased 58
percent in the first five months of 2011 from the same period of
last year because of the regional unrest, according to the
state-run Jordan Investment Board.  Foreign and domestic investment dropped to 336 million
dinars ($475 million) from 805 million dinars in the first five
months of 2010, Chief Executive Officer Samer Asfour said in an
interview in Amman. Foreign investment fell to 64 million dinars
from 163.5 million dinars and domestic investment to 272 million
dinars from 641.4 million dinars, he said.  “The political unrest in the region had an evident impact
on the kingdom in terms of attracting investment,” he said.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports more than 90 percent of its oil and relies on foreign
investment and grants to support its budget and current-account
deficits. The kingdom’s first-quarter public debt rose 5.1
percent from the end of last year to 12.05 billion dinars ($17
billion), the  Finance Ministry  said June 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
