Brazil ’s real gained for the first
time in four days on bets the central bank will continue to
raise  interest rates , luring more investors to real-denominated
assets.  The real strengthened 0.9 percent to 1.5832 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 1.5970 on June 10. The currency, which
lost 1.3 percent last week, was the best performer among major
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg today.  Economists increased their expectations for inflation next
year for the first time in a month, predicting consumer prices
will rise 5.13 percent next year, compared with a 5.1 percent
forecast the previous week, according to the median estimate in
a June 10 central bank survey of about 100 economists published
today.  Central bankers raised the benchmark lending rate 25 basis
points last week to 12.25 percent, keeping a pledge to raise
borrowing costs for a “sufficiently long period” to bring
inflation back to their target in 2012, according to a statement
accompanying the June 8 decision.  “The expectation of higher yields ends up appreciating the
currency,” said Eduardo Galasini, head of proprietary trading
at Banco Banif Primus, in a telephone interview from  Sao Paulo .  Yields on the interest-rate futures contract due in January
declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.39
percent, suggesting traders expected the central bank may raise
the key borrowing costs to 12.75 percent by year-end. The yield
on the contract maturing in January 2017 rose one basis point to
12.14 percent.  Inflation Targeting  Policy makers are scheduled to release the minutes of last
week’s meeting on June 16. Consumer prices rose 6.55 percent in
the year through May. The central bank aims to slow inflation
back to the mid-point of its target in 2012. The government
targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage
points.  “We’re going to wait for the minutes to see how
‘sufficiently long’ the monetary tightening will be,” David Rocha, a fixed-income trader at Renascenca DTVM Ltda, said in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  The central bank said it purchased dollars today in the
 spot market  at 1.5870 reais each. Buying the U.S. currency is
part of a regular effort by policy makers to stem the real’s
two-year, 22 percent rally, the most in emerging markets tracked
by Bloomberg over the period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
