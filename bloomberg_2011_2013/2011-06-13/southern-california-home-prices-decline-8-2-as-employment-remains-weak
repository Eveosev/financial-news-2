Southern California home prices fell
8.2 percent last month as unemployment remained high and
mortgages were hard to obtain, DataQuick said.  The median paid in the six-county region was $280,000, down
from $305,000 a year earlier and unchanged from April, the San
Diego-based data seller said today in a statement. Sales fell 17
percent from May 2010 to a total of 18,394 new and resale houses
and condominiums, the 11th straight year-over-year decline.  “Some of the fundamental drivers of housing demand have
yet to strengthen enough to lift sales to even average levels,”
 John Walsh , DataQuick’s president, said in the statement. “Weak
job growth, tight credit and hesitancy among potential buyers
and sellers” are combining to restrain the market, he said.  California’s jobless rate was 11.9 percent in April, higher
than the 9 percent nationwide, the state’s Employment
Development Department  reported  May 20. The drop in Southern
California home prices last month was the steepest since
September 2009, DataQuick said today. The number of new homes
sold was the lowest in company records dating back to 1988.  The Southern California region encompasses  Los Angeles ,
Riverside,  San Diego , Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange
counties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
