Italy would need to recover 80
billion euros ($115 billion) in revenue before it can cut taxes,
daily  La Stampa  reported, citing comments by Finance Minister
Giulio Tremonti.  The cash could come from cutting politiciansâ€™ salaries,
reducing  tax evasion  and cutting back on deductions, Stampa
quoted Tremonti as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
