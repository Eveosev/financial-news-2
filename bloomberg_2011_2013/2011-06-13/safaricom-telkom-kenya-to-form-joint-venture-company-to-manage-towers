Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , East Africa’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, and Telkom Kenya Ltd., a unit of
 France Telecom SA (FTE) , are in talks to form a joint venture to
manage their transmission towers.  The companies are currently in “advanced negotiations”
and expect to reach an agreement within the next three months,
they said in a e-mailed statement today.  The plan was “prompted by the need for the industry to
explore improved cost efficiency on infrastructure management,”
Safaricom Chief Executive Officer Bob Collymore said.  Mobile phone users in East Africa’s largest economy rose at
the fastest pace in at least a year in the three months through
December as the cost of calls fell, the  Communications
Commission of Kenya  said June 8. Users increased 12 percent to
25 million, the Nairobi-based commission said. Telkom  Kenya  and
Safaricom have more than 4,000 towers between them, according to
Mickael Ghossein, chief executive officer at Telkom Kenya.
Safaricom is 40 percent owned by Vodafone Plc.  “We expect that in addition to the initial equity and debt
financing, each partner will contribute some of its existing
infrastructure into a common pool,” Ghossein said today. “We
also expect to consolidate future needs through central planning
and deployment so as to take advantage of the economies of scale
presented by this deal,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
