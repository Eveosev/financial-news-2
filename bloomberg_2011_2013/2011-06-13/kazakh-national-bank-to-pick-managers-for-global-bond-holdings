The Kazakh National Bank will select
managers to invest $200 million to $300 million in corporate
bonds, according to a request for proposals on  its website.   The holdings will be benchmarked against the Merrill Lynch
Global Broad Market Corporate Index, 1 to 10 years, according to
the statement. The manager must have at least $3 billion of
assets under management, including no more than $500 million in
global investment-grade corporate bonds, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
