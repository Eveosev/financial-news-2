Madagascar’s transitional government
should all allow political exiles, including former president
 Marc Ravalomanana , to return to the country without conditions,
the South African Development Community said.  A head-of-state summit of the regional group also agreed
that the roadmap to end a political crisis and hold elections,
proposed by its mediator, should be signed by all parties after
some changes, SADC said in an e-mailed statement today. It
didn’t clarify what the changes were.  Ravalomanana has been in exile in South Africa since 2009
after being ousted as president by Andry Rajoelina. The SADC
roadmap proposed Rajoelina stay as head of a transitional
administration until elections. The three main opposition
groups, led by former presidents Didier Ratsiraka,  Albert Zafy 
and Ravalomanana, haven’t agreed to the roadmap.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
