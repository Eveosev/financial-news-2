liquefied natural gas terminal on  India ’s east coast to meet
demand for the fuel from fertilizer units and  power plants ,
 livemint.com  reported, citing unidentified officials at the
companies which set up the Orissa-based joint venture.  Dhamra Port, a venture between Tata Steel Ltd. and Larsen &
