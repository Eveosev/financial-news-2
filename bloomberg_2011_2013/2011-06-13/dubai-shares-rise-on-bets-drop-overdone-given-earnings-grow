Dubai’s benchmark stock index led
Persian Gulf markets higher, rising the most in almost two
weeks, on bets a decline the past month was overdone based on
prospects for earnings and economic growth.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, advanced 0.7 percent and  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the
 United Arab Emirates ’ biggest construction company by market
value, jumped the most this month. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose
0.4 percent, the most since June 1, to 1,557.60 at the 2 p.m.
close in Dubai. Excluding today, the measure lost 2.8 percent in
the past month. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of the region’s
stocks increased 0.3 percent.  “Markets were oversold during the last month, so some
investors may now be positioning themselves in preparation for
second-quarter results,” said Samer Darwiche, financial analyst
at Gulfmena Investments in Dubai. “It looks like summer has
started in most markets with the low volumes we are seeing.”  About 69 million shares were traded in Dubai today,
compared with a 12-month daily average of 123 million shares.  A decline of 4.5 percent this year has left the 30
companies in Dubai’s benchmark index valued at about 8.9 times
estimated earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with 10.9 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  The International Monetary Fund forecasts that economic
growth will accelerate to about 3 percent in Dubai this year,
 Masood Ahmed , the director of the IMF’s  Middle East  and Central
Asia Department, said April 27. Growth in the U.A.E. will
accelerate to 3.3 percent from 3.2 percent, the IMF forecast.  Emaar gained the most since June 9 to 3.10 dirhams. Arabtec
jumped 1.5 percent, the most since May 31, to 1.32 dirhams.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  was little changed. Kuwait’s SE Price
Index gained 0.2 percent,  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  rose 0.3
percent, Oman’s MSM 30 Index increased 0.4 percent and  Saudi
Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.5 percent. Bahrain’s
BB All Share Index declined 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
