Nakheel PJSC, the state-backed
builder of palm-shaped islands, said Dubai’s government will
provide “significant financial support” to build houses at the
 Jumeirah Golf Estates  project.  Construction has restarted on the development, set
around a golf course designed by Greg Norman, and at least 306
homes will be completed in 2012, Nakheel said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “We are committed to managing and delivering this key
project for Dubai,” Nakheel said.  Developers in Dubai, the  Middle East ’s worst-performing
property market in the past three years, are focusing on
completing projects halted after the financial crisis. Dubai
Properties PJSC suspended work on a  Tiger Woods  branded golf
resort with 287 villas earlier this year, citing a struggling
luxury property market.  Nakheel, whose chief executive officer, Chris O’Donnell,
resigned last week, is reviving projects delayed while the
company began restructuring its debt. In November, the company
said Jumeirah Golf Estates received the “necessary support”
from Dubai’s government to restart development.  In June 2010, the developer said it will resume work on six
projects including Al Furjan, Jumeirah Park and Garden View
villas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
