Czech stocks climbed the most in six
weeks as commodities gained, boosting coal producer New World
Resources Plc and  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the country’s biggest power utility.  The PX equity gauge rose 0.9 percent to 1,226.5 at its 4:28
p.m. close in  Prague , its biggest one-day rally since May 2. NWR
rose 1.7 percent to 253.2 koruna. CEZ added 1.7 percent to 900.  NWR advanced after Klaus-Dieter Beck, head of its OKD unit,
said the commodity will gain as neighboring  Germany  plans to
give up nuclear power by 2022.  Europe ’s benchmark coal
derivatives rose in Amsterdam to as much as 131.75 euros per
metric ton, the highest in more than a month, after Beck’s
statement.  “Rising commodity prices are the main reason behind CEZ
and NWR gains today,” said  Josef Nemy , an analyst at Komercni
Banka AS, the Prague-based unit of Societe Generale SA.
“Electricity exceeded the psychological level of 60 euros per
megawatt-hour.”  Power for next-year delivery in Germany, where CEZ exports
part of its output, added 0.75 percent to 60.2 euros per MWh,
the highest for the futures contract this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
