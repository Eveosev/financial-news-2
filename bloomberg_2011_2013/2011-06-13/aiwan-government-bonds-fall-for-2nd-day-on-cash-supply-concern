Taiwan’s benchmark 10-year bonds
fell, pushing yields to the highest this year, on speculation
tightening measures by the central bank will reduce cash
supplies.  The overnight rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, is at 0.342 percent, near the two-year high of
0.343 percent reached on June 2. Ten-year bond yields rose 11
basis points last week. The central bank may lift its benchmark
interest rate by 12.5 basis points to 1.875 percent when it
reviews borrowing costs on June 30, said  Albert Lee , a bond
trader at Cathay United Bank Co. in Taipei.  “The usual buyers, such as the post office and insurers,
are not buying at the moment as they are worried liquidity is
getting tighter,” Lee said. “Also, the slump last week has
triggered some panic selling today.”  The yield on the 1.375 percent note due March 2021
increased two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.55
percent as of the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The local dollar retreated 0.2 percent to
NT$28.892 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei
Forex Inc.  The overnight rate was little changed from 0.341 percent on
June 10, according to a weighted average compiled by Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
