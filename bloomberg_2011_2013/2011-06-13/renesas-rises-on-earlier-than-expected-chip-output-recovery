Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , the
largest maker of microcontrollers used in cars, rose the most in
almost three weeks in Tokyo trading after saying disrupted
output will recover faster than expected.  Renesas advanced as much as 4.2 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since May 18, and was 3.3 percent higher at 746
yen as of the 11 a.m. trading break. The benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average fell 0.8 percent.  Supply of chips previously made at Renesas’s Naka plant,
which was halted after  Japan ’s record earthquake on March 11,
will be restored to normal levels by the end of September by
moving some output to other factories, the Kawasaki-based
manufacturer said June 10. Renesas had earlier said it would
restore production levels by October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
