LinkedIn Corp. attracted 6.7 percent
more users last month, when it became the first major U.S.
social-networking site to hold an initial public offering,
according to  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)   LinkedIn’s U.S. user base climbed to 33.4 million in May,
following a 2.5 percent decline in April from March, according
to Reston, Virginia-based ComScore. It’s closing in on the
second-biggest U.S. social-networking site, Myspace, which has
34.9 million users. Facebook Inc. remains dominant in the field.  LinkedIn’s May 18 IPO raised its profile with investors and
helped build publicity around the  Mountain View , California-
based company. Its shares more than doubled on their first day
of trading, though they’ve since given up some of those gains.
To keep expanding its user base, LinkedIn is adding features and
letting outside software developers take advantage of the site’s
social graph -- the map of how everyone is connected.  “Current user growth exhibits strong momentum,” Ken Sena,
an analyst with  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  in  New York , said today
in a note initiating coverage on LinkedIn. “User growth on the
platform will remain strong, and we see enormous opportunity to
leverage LinkedIn’s user profile information and social graph
for the benefit of third parties building on its platform.”  LinkedIn’s shares rose $2.44, or 3.4 percent, to $75.27 at
4 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have climbed
67 percent since the IPO.  Global Growth  The company could increase its global registered user base
to more than 500 million by 2017, from 90 million last year,
said Sena, who has a neutral rating on the shares. LinkedIn’s
revenue more than doubled to $93.9 million during the first
quarter, while net income rose 14 percent to $2.08 million.  Facebook remained the No. 1 U.S. social-networking site,
with 157.2 million users in May, ComScore said. That was up from
154.1 million in April.  Palo Alto , California-based Facebook has
grown every month since February in the U.S.  Those figures run counter to another report, which found a
decline in May.  Inside Facebook Gold , which provides data on the
social network, estimates that U.S. users fell almost 4 percent
to 149.4 million in the month. Overseas markets are helping
offset the slowdown at home, according to the report.  Twitter was the fourth-largest social-networking company in
the U.S., with 27 million users, ComScore said. The San
Francisco-based website had 24.5 million in April.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
