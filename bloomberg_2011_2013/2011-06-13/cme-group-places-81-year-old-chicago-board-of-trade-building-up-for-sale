CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures exchange, is putting up for sale its 81-year-old  Chicago 
Board of Trade Building in the city’s financial district.  The company plans to sell and lease back the main tower and
Annex building, which together have 1.4 million square feet
(130,000 square meters) of space, it said today in a statement.
Chicago-based CME hired  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  and Holly Duran
Real Estate Partners LLC, both with headquarters in the city as
well, to market the buildings.  The exchange will continue to own and occupy the 288,000-
square-foot east building, home to its financial product trading
facilities. CME plans to enter into a long-term lease for the
agricultural commodities trading facilities and some  office
space  in the main tower.  “The sale of the Chicago Board of Trade north and south
buildings will enable CME Group to continue to reinvest in our
core derivatives business,” Chief Financial Officer Jamie
Parisi said in the statement. The company will lease about
150,000 square feet in the two buildings, he said.  The skyscraper, at 141 West Jackson Blvd. in Chicago’s
Central Loop, was built in 1930 and designated a historic
landmark in 1978. Features of the Art Deco building include a
three-story sculpture of Ceres, the Roman goddess of
agriculture. A $20 million renovation of the property was
completed in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
