ScottishPower Renewables, a unit of
Iberdrola Renovables SA, opened two wind farms in the U.K. that
will generate enough power for 100,000 homes.  ScottishPower started the 28-turbine Mark Hill and 60-
turbine Arecleoch parks in South Ayrshire,  Scotland , according
to a statement today from the Scottish government. The move
brings to 1 gigawatt the Glasgow-based company’s wind
electricity generation capacity in the U.K.  Iberdrola Renovables, the world’s largest wind energy
company, plans to invest 3 billion pounds ($4.9 billion) on U.K.
energy development focusing on renewables from 2010 to 2012. It
will spend 70 percent of that in Scotland, according to the
statement.  The amount of renewable energy installed, being built or
permitted in Scotland will enable the nation to exceed its goal
of meeting 31 percent of electricity use from renewables this
year, said  Alex Salmond , the Scottish first minister.  Mark Hill is a 56-megawatt wind farm while Arecleoch has a
120-megawatt capacity, according to the company website.
Scotland aims to produce the equivalent of 100 percent of its
annual power consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
