The Bovespa stock index fell to its
lowest in 11 months as a drop in commodity prices dimmed the
outlook for producers and concern mounted that European leaders
may not be able to reach an accord on a Greek bailout.  Iron-ore miner  Vale SA (VALE3)  and oil producer  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4)  followed metal and crude lower. BRF Brasil Foods SA, the
world’s biggest poultry exporter, dropped for a ninth day amid
speculation antitrust regulators may not approve the merger that
formed the company in 2009.  The Bovespa index fell 1.1 percent to 62,022.92 at the
close of  Sao Paulo  trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the
lowest since July 5. Forty-seven stocks fell on the index, while
19 rose. The real strengthened 0.7 percent to 1.5856 per  U.S.
dollar .  “The big problem is still the European debt crisis,” said
Felipe Miranda, an analyst at Empiricus Research, a Sao Paulo-
based equity consulting firm. “It makes investors a bit more
cautious about putting money in stocks.”  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  and
German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  are at odds over
investors’ role in the second Greek rescue in 14 months. The
dispute turns on how politicians make good on a promise to push
creditors to pay some of the cost, a step that Trichet said on
June 9 could be an “enormous mistake.”  Greece had its  credit rating  cut three levels by  Standard &
Poor’s , which branded the nation with the world’s lowest debt
grade and said in a statement a restructuring looks
“increasingly likely.”  Crude, Copper  Crude oil fell to a four-week low as government data showed
 China ’s oil-product consumption fell 4 percent in May. Copper
slid, extending two weekly declines, on concern a weakening
global economy will trim demand for industrial metals.  Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, dropped 1.6
percent to 23.33 reais.  Vale  slid 1.5 percent to 43.40 reais.  Electronics and furniture retailer Magazine Luiza SA
advanced 0.9 percent to 17.30 reais after saying in a regulatory
filing it agreed to buy all 121 stores of Grupo Silvio Santos’
Bau da Felicidade for 83 million reais ($52 million).  BRF Brasil Foods SA, the world’s biggest poultry exporter,
dropped for the ninth day, the longest losing streak since 1997.
Antitrust regulators will rule June 15 on whether the company,
formed by Perdigao SA’s takeover of Sadia SA in 2009, has too
much market share and should be dismantled. Carlos Ragazzo, one
of the antitrust agency commissioners, said June 8 the merger
doesn’t benefit consumers.  Brasil Foods  fell 4.6 percent to 24.09 reais.  Inflation Concern  The Bovespa trades at 10 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, the lowest since January 2009, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 12.5 for
the Shanghai Composite Index, 6.6 for Russia’s Micex and 14.8
for India’s Sensex. The index lost 15 percent from a November
high through last week on concern accelerating inflation will
hurt economic growth.  Investors pulled 1.61 billion reais from Latin America’s
biggest equity market this year through June 8, data from the
Sao Paulo exchange show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
