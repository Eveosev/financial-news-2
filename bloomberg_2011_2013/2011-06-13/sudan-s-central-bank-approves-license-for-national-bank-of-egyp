Sudan’s  central bank  gave a license
to the National Bank of Egypt to operate in the African country,
Central Bank Governor Mohamed Khair al-Zubair told parliament
today in Omdurman, a suburb of the capital, Khartoum.  The license was awarded to the Cairo-based bank last month,
al-Zubair said. The bank also approved a request by  Abu Dhabi
Islamic Bank  to open a branch in the country, the central bank
said on May 25.  The financial industry will be fully run according to
Islamic law when oil-rich Southern Sudan is declared independent
on July 9, parliamentary speaker Ahmed Ibrahim Al-Tahir said
today. The central bank allows a conventional banking system in
the south, while banks in northern  Sudan  must adhere to Islamic
law.  The country had 39 operating banks at the end of last year,
al-Zubair said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
