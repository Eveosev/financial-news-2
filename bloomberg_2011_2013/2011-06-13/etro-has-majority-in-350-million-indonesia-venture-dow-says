Metro AG (MEO)  will hold a 60 percent
majority in a joint venture with Indonesian investment firm
Sintesa,  Dow Jones  reported today, citing an unidentified
Sintesa executive. The joint venture, which aims to open six
wholesale stores in the next three years in Indonesia, will have
a value of $350 million, the  news agency  said.  The German retailer said June 10 on its  website  that it
formed the venture with Sintesa, without specifying the
ownership breakdown. It said the venture plans more than 20
wholesale stores in Indonesia "in the medium term," with an
investment of 10 million euros ($14 million) to 15 million euros
in each for land and building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
