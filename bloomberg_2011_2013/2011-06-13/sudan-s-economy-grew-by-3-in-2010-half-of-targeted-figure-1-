Sudan ’s economy grew by 3 percent
last year, compared with a government target of 6 percent,
 Central Bank  Governor Mohamed Khair al-Zubair said.  Growth has slowed from 11.3 percent in 2006 and 10.2
percent in 2007 as the African country prepares for the
secession of oil-rich Southern Sudan on July 9. The country’s
economy grew by 4.5 percent in 2009, the  International Monetary
Fund  said in its October  Regional Economic Outlook  report.  Money supply rose by 25 percent in 2010, compared with the
target of 22.5 percent, as inflation increased to 15 percent in
the year against the targeted 9 percent, al-Zubair told
parliament in Omdurman, a suburb of the capital, Khartoum.  “Foreign investment is still flowing into the country,
even though it declined last year,” deputy central bank
Governor Badr Al-Din Abbas said today. He declined to provide
figures. In November, former central bank Governor Sabir Hassan
said foreign direct investment had almost halted due to
political instability.  Clashes in recent weeks along the border between northern
and  Southern Sudan  have raised concerns about a resumption of
the two-decade civil war that ended with a 2005  peace agreement 
between the north and the south.  Budget Deficit  Sudan’s budget deficit was equivalent to about 3 percent of
gross domestic product in 2010, Abbas said today. The budget for
this year, which foresees a 3.2 percent deficit, is based on a
target of 5 percent growth and an inflation rate of 12 percent,
Finance Minister Ali Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul said in November.  The Sudanese government’s May 1 Islamic bond sale was the
third consecutive issue that failed to raise the full amount
sought within the subscription period. The government relies on
sukuk as one of its main forms of borrowing. The country is
denied access to international markets as it has been subject to
U.S. economic sanctions since 1997.  Land-locked Southern Sudan, which will assume control of
about 75 percent of Sudan’s current oil production of 490,000
barrels a day at independence, will pay the north fees for the
use of pipelines and facilities at  Port Sudan  on the  Red Sea  to
export the crude, Idris Abdelgadir, state minister for
presidential affairs, told parliament June 8.  Northern and Southern Sudan have started “pure direct
commercial negotiations” to discuss usage fees, he said. Under
the peace accord, northern and Southern Sudan currently split
proceeds from oil pumped in the south on a 50-50 basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
