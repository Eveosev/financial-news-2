What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that warmer,
drier weather last week allowed U.S. farmers to complete Midwest
planting, before rains expected during the next two weeks that
will aid crop development, said Chad Henderson, a market analyst
for Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,
 Wisconsin .  -- Soybean futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that a government report today will show
farmers accelerated planting while weather remains favorable for
early growth, Henderson said. Soybean-oil futures are expected
to open 0.05 cent lower to 0.05 cent higher per pound, and
soybean-meal futures may open down $1 to $2 for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that livestock producers will use
more of the grain as a cheaper alternative to corn in feed
rations, Henderson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
