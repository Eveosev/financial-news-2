The  risk premium  charged on Spanish
bonds compared with benchmark German securities limits the
country’s ability to grow and create jobs, making steps to boost
confidence in the county “urgent,”  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA)  Chairman  Francisco Gonzalez  said.  “For our creditors,  Spain  continues to be a cause for
concern,” Gonzalez said at a conference in Santander, Spain,
today. If Spain doesn’t take steps quickly to restore investors
confidence, “they will take decisions for us and that way we
will have done great damage to the Spanish,” he said.  Efforts to make Spain’s labor market more flexible haven’t
been sufficient and transparency on regional finances is
“fundamental,” said Gonzalez, who added that the country needs
to auction off the weakest savings banks. Bilbao-based BBVA is
Spain’s second-biggest bank by assets.  Every percentage point of risk premium means an extra cost
for the country of 12.4 billion euros ($17.8 billion) a year, he
said. The spread between Spanish and German 10-year debt jumped
to 253 basis from 224 basis points a week ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
