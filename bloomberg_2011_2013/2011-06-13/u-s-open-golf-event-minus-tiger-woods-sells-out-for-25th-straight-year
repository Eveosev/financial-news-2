The U.S. Open sold out its
championship-round tickets for the 25th straight year, even
without  Tiger Woods  in the field for the first time since 1994.  Golf’s second major championship of the season will be
played June 16-19 at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda,
 Maryland . It’s the first time the  U.S. Open  has been held near
the nation’s capital since 1997 at Congressional, when Ernie Els
claimed his second title.  The  U.S. Golf Association , which hosts the tournament, said
in an e-mail yesterday that the remaining tickets -- which were
for the first of the four championship rounds -- have been sold.
The USGA has said it expects more than 35,000 spectators to
attend each day of the championship.  Practice-round tickets are still available from today
through June 15, organizers said.  Woods, a three-time  U.S. Open  winner, announced last week
that he’d skip this week’s tournament as he recovers from knee
and ankle injuries. In the two days after his withdrawal, U.S.
Open ticket prices dropped 20 percent on the resale market.  The USGA has started selling select  advance tickets  on its
website to next year’s U.S. Open, which will be held at the
Olympic Club in  San Francisco .  To contact the reporter on this story:
