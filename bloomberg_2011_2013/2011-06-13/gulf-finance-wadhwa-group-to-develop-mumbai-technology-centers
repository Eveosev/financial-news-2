Gulf Finance House BSC, a Bahrain-
based investment bank, said  India ’s  Wadhwa Group  will invest
more than $1 billion to develop the bank’s energy and technology
centers near  Mumbai .  Gulf Finance spent about $1 billion to buy 1,250 acres of
land in Navi Mumbai on the city’s outskirts and the permits to
build two projects, Hisham Al Rayes, Gulf Finance’s chief
investment officer. said in a phone interview from Dubai today.
The agreement will allow the bank’s investors to exit the
projects over time, while work on building infrastructure will
begin shortly, Al Rayes said.  A change in market conditions since the onset of the credit
crisis made “exits through direct land sales without real
development” of the centers “unviable,” Al Rayes said. Gulf
Finance and Wadhwa will build offices, homes, hotels and malls,
he said.  Gulf Finance announced plans to build the
telecommunications park for energy companies in 2006 at a cost
of $2 billion. The bank expanded the project after a good
response from investors in the Gulf Arab region, it said in
2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
