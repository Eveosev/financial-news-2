India ’s 10-year bond yield held near
the lowest level in a month on speculation a slowing economy
will prompt the central bank to ease the pace of interest-rate
increases.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will increase the repurchase rate
by 25 basis points to 7.5 percent on June 16, according to 15 of
17 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
boosted the benchmark by half a percentage point on May 3 to
rein in inflation, saying he was abandoning his “baby step”
approach. Output at factories, utilities and mines rose 6.3
percent in April from a year earlier, after an 8.8 percent gain
in March, the  Central Statistical Office  said June 10.  “Bond yields are staying soft as investors are betting the
central bank will go slow on hiking rates as the economy has
started slowing,” said A. Y. Shedshale, a Mumbai-based deputy
general manager at Bank of Maharashtra.  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.24 percent as of the
5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. Earlier, it touched 8.21 percent, the lowest level since
May 12.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
was little changed at 7.90 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
