Novartis AG (NVS) ’s Alcon unit sued  Watson
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  to prevent U.S. sales of a generic version
of the pink eye treatment Pataday until 2024.  Watson is seeking Food and Drug Administration approval to
sell a copy of Pataday, an antihistamine known as olopatadine
hydrochloride, according to a June 9 complaint filed by Alcon in
federal court in Indianapolis. Alcon contends the copy would
infringe three patents that expire in 2015, 2022 and 2024.  Novartis, based in Basel,  Switzerland , said in April sales
of Pataday and a related drug, Patanol, contributed to a 31
percent increase in sales of allergy products in the first
quarter. Alcon won a court ruling in May that upheld the 2015
patent in a case against Apotex Inc. over Patanol.  In the lawsuit against Corona, California-based Watson,
Alcon and Tokyo-based partner Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. are seeking
a court order that would prevent the FDA from approving Watson’s
application until all three patents expire. Such lawsuits are
common to clarify  patent rights  before the generic drug enters
the market.  The case is Alcon Research Ltd. v. Watson Laboratories
Inc., 11cv786, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
 Indiana  (Indianapolis).  To contact the reporter on this story:
