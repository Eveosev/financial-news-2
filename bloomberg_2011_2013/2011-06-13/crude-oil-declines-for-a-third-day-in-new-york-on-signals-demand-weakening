Oil traded near the lowest in almost
a month on speculation fuel demand may falter as the  U.S.
economy  slows, countering signs of rising industrial output in
 China , the world’s second-largest crude user.  Futures were little changed after falling as much as 0.8
percent and climbing as much as 0.3 percent today. Crude pared
earlier losses after a report showed China’s industrial
production slowed less than economists forecast. Consumer prices
in the country climbed 5.5 percent, the quickest pace since
2008. A report today may show U.S. retail sales fell in May for
the first time in 11 months.  “The market is concerned about economic growth,” said
 Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney, who predicted crude in  New York  will
average $100 a barrel this year. “The economics suggest oil
should be lower rather than higher.”  Crude for July delivery was at $97.55 a barrel, up 25
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 3:09 p.m. Singapore time. The contract yesterday declined
$1.99, or 2 percent, to $97.30, the lowest settlement since May
17. Futures have gained 29 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for July delivery rose 13 cents to $119.23 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The more
actively traded August contract advanced 22 cents to $118.64.
The front-month European benchmark contract was at a premium of
$21.69 to U.S. futures after climbing to a record $21.80
yesterday.  Chinese Economy  China’s factory output expanded 13.3 percent last month,
the statistics bureau in Beijing said today. This beat a median
13.1 percent increase forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. The gain in consumer prices matched the median estimate.  The ruling Communist Party is seeking to tame inflation and
sustain growth after riots this month by migrant workers in the
manufacturing hub of Guangdong. The central bank has raised
 interest rates  four times since October to cool the economy.  Chinese refiners processed 38.47 million metric tons of
crude in May, 6 percent more than a year earlier, data today
from the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing showed.
Gasoline output climbed 3.6 percent and diesel production rose
8.2 percent. China uses more oil than any country except the
U.S.  U.S. advance retail sales probably dropped 0.5 percent last
month, according to the median estimate of 81 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before a Commerce Department report
today. Sales advanced 0.5 percent in April.  “Almost every day, there is some fresh economic data that
seems to fit better in an anemic recovery than in one that is
robust or dynamic,”  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover
Inc., an energy adviser in  New Canaan ,  Connecticut , said today
in an e-mailed note.  Fuel Supplies  U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably increased for a sixth
week last week, according to a Bloomberg News survey before an
Energy Department report tomorrow. Supplies rose 1 million
barrels from 214.5 million, based on the median estimate of
eight analysts. Crude inventories may have decreased 1.75
million barrels from 369 million, the poll showed.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  will
report its own stockpile data today.  Oil in New York is likely to remain in a “consolidation
range” of $95 to $105 a barrel, based on technical charts,
according to The Schork Group Inc.  A breach of yesterday’s low of $96.13 a barrel may indicate
prices will fall to $95.68 and $94.06,  Stephen Schork , president
of the consultant in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , said today. A
recovery to $98.10 will “clear a path” to $98.92 and $100.54,
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
