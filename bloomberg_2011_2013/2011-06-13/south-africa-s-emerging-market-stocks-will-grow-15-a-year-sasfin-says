South African stocks that do
business in emerging markets, including  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  and
 Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO) , will rise 10 percent to 15 percent annually
over the next three years,  Sasfin Holdings Ltd. (SFN)  said.  Faster economic growth in  China ,  Russia  and  India  will
compensate for slower expansion in developed nations, David Shapiro, the chief executive officer of Sasfin’s securities
business, which oversees 45 billion rand ($6.6 billion) of
assets, said in an interview.  “Emerging countries will continue to grow and they
continue to demand the commodities produced by the companies,”
he said. “Investors need to focus on the individual companies
and see what they do on the ground.”  South Africa  has underperformed emerging markets, with the
FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index down 3.5 percent this year
compared with a 2.3 percent slide for the MSCI Emerging Markets
measure. Developing economies are forecast to expand 6.3 percent
this year, outpacing a 3.2 percent worldwide average, the  World
Bank  said on June 8.  Shares including  British American Tobacco Plc (BTI) ,  Exxaro
Resources Ltd. (EXX) , and Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the maker of
luxury watches, will also help lead “double-digit growth” in
South Africa’s stocks gauge, Shapiro said. Wealthy Chinese
consumers own 4.4 luxury watches on average and Richemont’s
Cartier is the most preferred jewelry brand, according to the
Hurun Wealth Report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
