China  is taking the lead in a new
industrial revolution that will curb  greenhouse gases , said
Nicholas Stern, the London School of Economics professor who
wrote the U.K. government report on the costs of cutting
pollution.  Stern said that China’s 12th five-year plan published this
year was a “remarkable document” that will transform the
country’s economy and may give it the edge over the U.S. and
 Europe  as the world shifts away from fossil fuels.  “They are moving very strongly down the road to a low
carbon economy,” Stern said at a press conference in Madrid
today. “China is becoming the leader.”  United Nations officials are meeting in Bonn, Germany, this
week to try and save the framework for controlling emissions.
Limits outlined in 1997 in the  Kyoto Protocol , the only global
treaty curbing emissions, expire next year. China’s refusal to
accept a cap on its own carbon dioxide output doesn’t mean it is
not making efforts to reduce energy use, Stern said.  “Mutual confidence is very important, and that’s not
necessarily the same as a legally binding agreement,” he said.
“We have to get much better at that.”  Policymakers in the U.S. and Europe risk surrendering the
most important new industry of this century to the Chinese
through their reluctance to put in place incentives for clean
energy production and energy efficiency, he said.  “We have seen in Europe some signs of hesitancy over the
last year or so,” he said. “That’s a collective mistake.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
