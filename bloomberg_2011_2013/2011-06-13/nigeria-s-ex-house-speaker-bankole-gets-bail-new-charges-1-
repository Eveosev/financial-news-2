The former speaker of  Nigeria ’s
House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole, was granted bail at
the Federal High Court in Abuja, the capital, and was re-
arrested to face new charges by the anti-graft agency.  High Court Judge David Okorowa granted Bankole, 41, bail of
5 million naira ($32,000) today in a case in which he is charged
with 16 counts of fraud in connection with a 1 billion-naira
graft probe. Okorowa ordered him to submit his travel documents
to the court and fixed the trial for July 26.  The  Economic and Financial Crimes Commission , in its new
charges, accused Bankole of 17 counts of fraud in connection
with a 38 billion-naira corruption investigation, the agency’s
lawyer, Festus Keyamo, said in an e-mailed statement. Usman
Nafada, who was deputy speaker to Bankole, was also charged.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, ranks 134th on a list
of 178 nations on a corruption index compiled by Berlin-based
graft monitor,  Transparency International .  The West African country lost about $380 billion to
corruption between independence in 1960 and the end of military
rule in 1999, New York-based  Human Rights Watch  said in an
October 2007 report.  The case is Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Dimeji Bankole,
FHC/ABJ/CR/47/2011, Federal High Court of Justice Abuja.  To contact the reporter on this story:
