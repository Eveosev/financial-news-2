Nottingham Forest signed former
England and Middlesbrough manager  Steve McClaren  to a three-year
contract to lead the Championship soccer team.  The 50-year-old was an assistant at  Manchester United  when
the team won the Champions League, three Premier League titles
and a Football Association Cup. Middlesbrough won the League Cup
and Dutch team FC Twente won its first league title under
McClaren. He’s replacing Billy Davies, who was fired.  “The club moved quickly to secure his services as it is
rare for a manager and coach of his undoubted calibre to be
available,” Forest Chief Executive Officer Mark Arthur said
today in a statement on the club’s website.  McClaren was coach at Wolfsburg in Germany last season. He
led the England national side for more than a year before
leaving in November 2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
