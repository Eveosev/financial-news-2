Egypt ’s public prosecutor referred
20 people for trial over clashes between Muslims and Christians
that left two people dead in April.  The 20 will be tried in a state security criminal court on
charges that include murder, creating “sectarian sedition,”
possessing weapons and “endangering public peace,” the
prosecutor’s office in Cairo said in a statement today.  The charges stem from fighting between Muslims and
Christians in Abu Qurqas village in Egypt’s southern Minya
province. The clashes, which erupted after a collision between
two cars, also left four people injured, and those involved set
a number of houses ablaze, the prosecutor’s office said.  Christians make up an estimated 10 percent of Egypt’s
population. Muslims and Christians coexist largely peacefully,
though tensions have increasingly led to violence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
