China ’s daily oil-product use fell 4
percent last month from April while inventory levels rebounded,
the nation’s top economic planner said.  Daily consumption of gasoline, diesel and kerosene dropped
to 650,000 metric tons in May, the National Development and
Reform Commission said in a  statement  on its website today,
citing preliminary figures. Monthly consumption gained 5.2
percent from a year earlier to 20.19 million tons, with China
using 5.82 million tons of gasoline, up 7.5 percent, and 12.84
million tons of diesel, up 3.9 percent, the NDRC said.  Oil-product inventories rebounded “slightly” as of the
end of May from April and rose 1 million tons from a year
earlier, the NDRC said, without giving exact figures. Levels
were “normal,” according to the statement.  Oil processing rose 4.4 percent to 34.9 million tons last
month, or 8.3 million barrels a day, from a year earlier, the
NDRC said. This compares with 9.1 million barrels a day in April.
The National Bureau of Statistics is due to release official
production statistics tomorrow.  Crude oil output rose 1.1 percent to 17.26 million tons in
May, the NDRC said.  --Winnie Zhu, Jing Jin. Editors: Ryan Woo,  Paul Gordon .  To contact the reporter on this story:
