Canadian stocks advanced the most in
almost four weeks after the U.S. reported a smaller drop in
retail sales than most economists had forecast.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s biggest fuel producer, rose 2
percent as crude climbed from a four-week low.  Bank of Nova
Scotia (BNS) , the country’s third-largest lender by assets, gained 1.4

slipped 0.2 percent in May, less than 67 of 81 economists’
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s
largest base-metals and coal producer, increased 3 percent after

points, or 1.2 percent, to 13,097.82 after closing at the lowest
level since November yesterday.  “We’ve been bombarded with weak data for a while now, and
we’re seeing two good data points in the same day in the U.S.
and  China ,” said Mathieu Roy, a  money manager  at Louisbourg
Investments Inc. in Moncton,  New Brunswick , which manages about
C$1.5 billion ($1.5 billion). “That, coupled with a lot of
selling for a while now, was enough to change moods a little
bit.”  The S&P/TSX plunged 6.3 percent this month through
yesterday, the most among 24 developed-market stock benchmarks,
as economic data have reflected a slowing global recovery. The
index has not ended a month with a decline that large since
February 2009.  Retail Sales  Excluding autos, U.S. retail sales rose 0.3 percent last

0.9 percent to C$60.68.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  North
America ’s fourth-biggest insurer, rose 1.6 percent to C$16.16.  Industrial Production   Base-metals and coal producers climbed after China reported

surpassing 16 of 21 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.
Copper futures gained the most in nearly three months.  Teck advanced 3 percent to C$46.29.  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest publicly traded copper producer,

Group, rallied 5.4 percent to C$22.82.  Sherritt International Corp. (S) , which produces coal and base
metals, sank 5.7 percent to C$6.61 after raising cost estimates
for the Ambatovy Project in Madagascar. Sherritt owns a 40
percent interest in the nickel and cobalt project.  Uranium One Inc. and  Methanex Corp. (MX)  climbed after Brian MacArthur, an analyst at UBS AG, boosted his ratings on the
companies to “buy” from “neutral,” citing recent share-price
declines in notes to clients.  Uranium One, Methanex  Uranium One, a mining company controlled by Moscow-based

low as inflation quickened in China and  India .  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-largest gold producer by

which mines in China and  Turkey , climbed 1.8 percent to C$13.89.

percent to C$16.81 as that metal gained 1.9 percent.  China Gold International Resources Corp. rebounded 8.7
percent, the most in 11 months, to C$3.77 after tumbling 18
percent yesterday. The gold producer said production at its
Chang Shan mine nearly doubled in April and May from a year
earlier.  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) , the forestry company battling a short
seller’s assertions of financial manipulation, fell 33 percent
to a five-year low of C$3.36 after reporting first-quarter
earnings that trailed the average of six analyst estimates by 39
