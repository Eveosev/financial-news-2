Vietnam  imported its first load of
coal for power generators, the  Vietnam News Agency  reported,
citing the country’s National Coal and Mineral Industries Group,
known as VINACOMIN.  The shipment of about 9,575 metric tons of coal from
Indonesia arrived at the Cai Lai seaport today, according to the
report, which added that VINACOMIN plans to import about 10
million tons of coal in 2012. The nation is rich in the fuel and
the shipment came after years of discussions, the  news agency 
said.  The report didn’t specify whether it was the first import
of any coal, including varieties used to make steel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
