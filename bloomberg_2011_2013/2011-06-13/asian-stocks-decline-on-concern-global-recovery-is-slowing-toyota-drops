Asian stocks dropped, extending the
regional benchmark index’s longest streak of weekly losses since
October 2008, amid concern the global economy is slowing.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker by revenue,
declined 2.4 percent after forecasting a decline in profit.
Bridgestone Corp.,  Japan ’s No.1 tiremaker by market
capitalization, slid 2.5 percent after Japan’s machinery orders
fell in April, missing economist forecasts for a gain. In Taipei,
 HTC Corp. (2498) , a maker of smartphones using operating systems from
Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp., dropped 6.9 percent after UBS
AG said the company cut around 1 million units of orders across
different models. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell
0.8 percent after reporting sales fell in May from a month
earlier.  “Downward pressure on stocks is building -- make no
mistake about it,” said Hideo Arimura, who helps oversee about
$2.2 billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo . “The
consensus is bearish. There’s no good news coming out.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.5 percent 131.36 as of
7:24 p.m. in Tokyo, extending last week’s 1.4 percent decline.
About two stocks fell for each that rose in the gauge. The
measure has lost more than $461 billion in market capitalization
since this year’s peak on May 2, amid disappointing economic
data, capped by a jobs report that showed U.S. companies hired
fewer workers than estimated.  A “perfect storm” of fiscal woe in the U.S., a slowdown
in  China , European debt restructuring and stagnation in Japan
may converge on the global economy,  New York  University
professor Nouriel Roubini said. There’s a one-in-three chance
the factors will combine to stunt growth from 2013, Roubini said
in a June 11 interview in  Singapore .  Nikkei, Kospi Fall  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average declined 0.7 percent.
 South Korea ’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  climbed 0.1 percent.  New Zealand ’s NZX
50 Index fell 0.4 percent.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  climbed
0.4 percent, reversing a drop of up to 1.2 percent, and China’s
 Shanghai  Stock Exchange Composite Index slipped 0.2 percent.
Australian markets are closed today for a public holiday.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1
percent today. In New York, the index declined 1.4 percent on
June 10 amid concern the global economy is slowing. The gauge
has retreated six straight weeks, the longest slump since 2008.  A gauge of consumer discretionary stocks fell the most
among the 10 industry groups on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
today, led by Toyota.  Toyota Slumps  Toyota slid 2.4 percent to 3,220 yen in Tokyo, the biggest
single contributor to the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s declines
today. The company forecast a drop in profit after the nation’s
record earthquake disrupted production and sales and while the
yen strengthened.  Net income at the automaker may fall to 280 billion yen
($3.5 billion) in the 12 months ending March 31 from 408 billion
yen a year earlier, the company said in a statement on June 10
after markets closed.  “Investors are likely selling Toyota, being disappointed
at its forecasts. That may bring about speculative selling on
other carmakers and parts makers,” said Toshiyuki Kanayama, a
market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc.  Ricoh Co., an office equipment manufacturer, slumped 0.4
percent to 862 yen. Bridgestone dropped 2.5 percent to 1,801 yen.
 Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest camera maker by sales, lost 0.9
percent to 3,730 yen.  Machinery Orders  Machinery orders in Japan declined 3.3 percent in April
from March, the Cabinet Office said today in Tokyo. Orders, an
indicator of  capital spending  in three to six months, were
projected to increase 1.7 percent, according to the median
forecast of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Canon also fell after the Nikkei newspaper reported sales
volumes of digital single-lens reflex, or SLR, cameras fell in
May in its first year-on-year decline in 17 months. Sales
volumes declined 8.6 percent in May after supply disruptions
following the March 11 earthquake caused product shortages at
retailers, the Nikkei newspaper said, citing research firm BCN
Inc.  Nikon Corp. (7731) , that gets 67 percent of annual revenue from
imaging products including cameras, slipped 0.6 percent to 1,914
yen.  Sony Corp. (6758)  slid 0.4 percent to 2,017 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has fallen about 4.7 percent so
far this year, compared with a gain of 1.1 percent by the  S&P
500  and a drop of 2.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.3 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.8 times for the S&P 500
and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  Smartphone Orders  In Taipei, HTC Corp. slumped 6.9 percent to NT$1,085, the
second-biggest drag on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The company
cut around 1 million units of orders across different models in
the third quarter, UBS AG said in a report today.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. also declined in
Taipei trading, losing 0.8 percent to NT$74.7. The world’s
largest contract chipmaker reported NT$35.96 billion in May
sales, a decline from NT$36.23 billion in April.  Foxconn Technology Co., a maker of electronic parts,
slumped 6.9 percent to NT$121.5. The company said sales slumped
53 percent in May to NT$3.85 billion ($133 million) from a year
earlier. The company was also lowered to “neutral” from
“add” at Fubon Securities Co.  Among stocks that gained, Aluminum Corporation of China
Ltd., also known as Chalco, rose 2.8 percent to HK$6.66 in Hong
Kong after a media report said China may select three rare-earth
companies to lead restructuring.  Nonferrous Metals  In Shenzhen, China Nonferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign
Engineering & Construction Co. increased 5.5 percent to 38.38
yuan. In Shanghai, Rising Nonferrous Metals Share Co., which
receives about 72 percent of its revenue from China, jumped 6
percent to 73.23 yuan in Shanghai. Minmetals Development Co.,
which imports and exports metals and minerals, advanced 10
percent to 37.99 yuan.  Financial shares posted the smallest decline among the MSCI
Asia Pacific’s industry groups as Chinese banks advanced,
reversing earlier losses.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (1398)  Ltd., China’s biggest
bank by market value, rose 1.4 percent to HK$5.89 in Hong Kong,
reversing an earlier 1.2 percent retreat. China Construction
Bank Corp., the No.2 bank by market capitalization, increased
1.6 percent to HK$6.95. Bank of China Ltd. advanced 1 percent to
HK$3.95.  “We’re getting to the point of a pretty oversold market
where people could start stepping in,” said  Todd Martin , Asia
equity strategist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. “People
have been talking about relative values in China and we’ve seen
two weeks of pretty heavy selling.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
