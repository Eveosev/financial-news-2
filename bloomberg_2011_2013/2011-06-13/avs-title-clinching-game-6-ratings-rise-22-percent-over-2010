The Dallas Mavericks’ title-
clinching win over LeBron James and the Miami Heat drew 22
percent higher large-market television ratings than the
equivalent game held last year.  Game 6 of the National Basketball Association Finals last
night on ABC was seen in an average of 15 percent of households
in the top 56 U.S. television markets, the  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) 
network said, citing Nielson Media Research. That’s 22 percent
higher than the 12.3 rating that Game 6 between the  Los Angeles
Lakers  and  Boston Celtics  drew on a Tuesday night last year.  Yesterday’s contest also was the 25th straight time that an
NBA Finals game was the highest-rated program of the night.  The Mavericks beat the Heat 105-95 at AmericanAirlines
Arena in Miami to win the best-of-seven series for its first
title in franchise history. Dirk Nowitzki was named the series’
Most Valuable Player.  The rating for yesterday’s game was up 35 percent over the
11.1 rating the same two teams drew in 2006, when Miami clinched
a title in Game 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
