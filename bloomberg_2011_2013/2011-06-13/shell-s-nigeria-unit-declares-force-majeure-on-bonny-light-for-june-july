Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Nigerian
unit declared force majeure on Bonny Light oil loadings for this
month and July because of multiple fires on the Trans Niger
pipeline, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  “Production deferment over the period has affected the
loading program at Bonny Terminal, and SPDC will now have to
advise customers of a revised schedule,” Tony Okonedo, a
spokesman for Shell Petroleum Development Co., or SPDC, said
today in the statement. “The leaks have been repaired leading
to resumption of production on June 12.”  Shell originally planned to ship 243,333 barrels a day of
Bonny Light in June and 204,839 barrels a day next month,
according to loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News. The
company previously declared force majeure, a legal clause
allowing companies to miss deliveries because of circumstances
beyond their control, on Bonny exports for loading in December
and January because of a pipeline leak.  Nigeria is  Africa ’s biggest oil producer and the fifth-
biggest source of U.S. oil imports. Shell operates a joint
venture in the nation in which it holds a 30 percent stake and
state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. owns 55 percent.
Total SA has a 10 percent stake and Eni SpA holds 5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
