Colombia’s peso advanced as a
rebound in U.S. stocks pushed demand for higher-yielding,
emerging-market assets.  The peso climbed 0.2 percent to 1,773.95 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:36 a.m. New York time, from 1,777.45 on June 10. The peso has
jumped 7.5 percent so far this year, the best performance among
the six most-traded Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  U.S. stocks rose, rebounding after six weeks of losses, as
mergers and acquisitions overshadowed concern the economy is
slowing. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained as much as 0.5
percent.  “U.S. stock markets are correcting losses and what we’re
seeing today is that Latin American currencies are gaining on
the back of that,” said Santiago Melo, an analyst at brokerage
Alianza Valores in Bogota.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 was
little changed at 7.95 percent, according to  Colombia ’s stock
exchange. The security’s price fell 0.021 centavo to 116.334
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
