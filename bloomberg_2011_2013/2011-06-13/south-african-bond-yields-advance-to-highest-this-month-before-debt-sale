South African government bond yields
rose to the highest this month before tomorrow’s debt auction on
speculation rising electricity and fuel prices will boost
inflation in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  is offering 2.1 billion
rand ($308.7 million) of bonds maturing in 2026 and 2036 at its
weekly auction, it said on its Bloomberg page. The secondary
market yield on the 2026 bonds rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 8.53 percent at 3:04 p.m. in Johannesburg,
the highest on a closing basis since May 25 and 13 basis points
higher than at the previous auction on June 7.  South African municipalities have applied to raise
electricity charges as much as 28 percent from July 1, more than
the electricity regulator’s 20.38 percent guideline,  Business
Day  reported on June 10. Administered costs such as electricity
and fuel may drive inflation higher than the central bank’s 6
percent target, Deputy Governor  Daniel Mminele  said on May 27.  “The electricity tariff assumption is a potential upside
risk to inflation forecasts given that many projections,
including the Reserve Bank’s, seem to assume a 20 percent
increase,” Rand Merchant Bank analysts led by Theuns de Wet
said in a research note.  The yield difference, or breakeven rate, between 10-year
inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate securities of similar
maturity, a gauge of bond investors’ inflation expectations, has
widened nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 5.8
percent in the past week. Consumer inflation rose to 4.2 percent
in April, from 4.1 percent the previous month.  The secondary market yield on the 2036 bonds rose eight
basis points today to 8.72 percent, the highest since May 31.  Tomorrow’s bond auction starts at 11 a.m., and the results
will be announced at about 11:30 a.m., the Reserve Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
