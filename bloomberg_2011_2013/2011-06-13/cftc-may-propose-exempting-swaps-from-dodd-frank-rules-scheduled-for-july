The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  will consider a proposal tomorrow exempting swaps
from Dodd-Frank Act rules set to take effect in mid-July, giving
the agency more time to finish writing regulations for the $601
trillion market, said  Gary Gensler , CFTC chairman.  The agency will consider a proposal providing “temporary
relief” from some regulatory requirements scheduled to be in
force on July 16, one year from the enactment of Dodd-Frank,
Gensler said in a letter to three Republican senators.  “The proposed relief would make it clear that, though the
law will have changed, as a practical matter, the market will
have relief during the period of the exemption,” Gensler said
in the letter dated June 10 to Senators Pat Roberts, a Kansas
Republican,  Richard Lugar , an Indiana Republican, and  Saxby Chambliss , a Georgia Republican.  The CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission are
continuing to seek comment on rules, and have said they would
miss the scheduled completion date for some measures.  “There is too much at stake for these questions to go
unanswered,” Roberts said in a statement today. The CFTC
proposal would be open for public comment, Gensler said.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has
authority over security-based swaps, will publish guidance on
which rules take effect on July 16 and will provide “temporary
relief” from some provisions, the agency said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
