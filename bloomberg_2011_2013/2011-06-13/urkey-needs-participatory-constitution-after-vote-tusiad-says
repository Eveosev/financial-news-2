Turkey ’s new constitution should be
written in a “participatory and conciliatory” manner and place
individual rights at its core, the  Turkish Industry & Business
Association  said.  The new parliament, following yesterday’s general
elections, should “strengthen” Turkey’s European Union
membership process and economic stability, the Istanbul-based
group said today in an e-mailed statement. Sustainable
development will depend on “harmonized” monetary and fiscal
policies, improvements under a new industrial strategy and the
reduction of unemployment by increasing capacity, it said.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s  Justice and
Development Party  won a third term in office with 50 percent of
the vote. Erdogan said after the results were announced that
he’ll consult opposition parties and other groups in the process
of rewriting the constitution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
