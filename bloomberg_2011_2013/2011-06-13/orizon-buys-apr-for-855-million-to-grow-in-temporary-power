Horizon Acquisition Co., which sold
shares last year, agreed to purchase APR Energy for $855 million
to expand in the market for providing temporary power plants
through diesel and gasoline engines.  Horizon will pay $359 million in cash and the rest in new
Horizon shares, the company said in a statement in  London  today.
It will have about $275 million of cash left over after the
deal, which will be used to accelerate the growth of
Jacksonville, Florida-based APR.  APR, the world’s number two provider of temporary energy
after Aggreko Plc, won a contract with Tokyo Electric Power Co.
in April as the company coped with the loss of nuclear power
following the biggest earthquake in  Japan ’s history. Horizon,
backed by Pizza Express founder Hugh Osmond, is suspending
trading of its shares and expects to re-list as APR Energy Plc
by the end of September.  “We believe APR Energy is a great investment, offering
both immediate value and outstanding potential for our
shareholders,” Horizon Chairman Mike Fairey said in a
statement. “The injection of our cash accelerates APR Energy’s
ability to grow, and its stock market listing will enhance its
reputation and provide further access to growth capital if
required.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
