Waha Capital PJSC (WAHA) , a leasing company
based in Abu Dhabi, obtained a $505 million term and revolving
credit facility from 11 regional and international banks.  The facility is for three years, the company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Waha is “looking to deploy this capital in existing and
new investments,” Chief Executive Officer Salem Rashed Al Noaimi said in the statement.  The banks involved include  First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) , Emirates
NBD PJSC, HSBC Bank Middle East Ltd., Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank
PJSC, Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Ltd.  The company said in April that its board approved the sale
of mandatory convertible notes valued at as much as 500 million
dirhams ($136 million) by June 30. The notes will be converted
into shares three years after the sale, Waha said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
