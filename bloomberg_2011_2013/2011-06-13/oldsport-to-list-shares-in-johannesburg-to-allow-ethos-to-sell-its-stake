Holdsport Ltd., a South African
company that runs the Sportsmans Warehouse and Outdoor Warehouse
retail chains, plans to start trading its shares to facilitate
the exit of its majority shareholder, Ethos Private Equity,
Chief Executive Officer Kevin Hodgson said.  Ethos, the nation’s largest private equity firm, owns about
67 percent of the company while management holds the rest,
Hodgson said on a conference call today.  “We can open two to three stores a year for the next five
years,” said Hodgson. adding that the company doesn’t plan to
raise capital from the listing.  The company, which operates 51 stores in  South Africa  and
one in  Namibia , has revenue of about 1.1 billion rand ($162
million), it said in an e-mailed statement. Ethos bought its
stake in Holdsport in September 2006 for 681 million rand,
according to a statement on its website. UBS AG will advise
Holdsport on the offer.  Holdsport will publish the pre-listing statement “in the
next few weeks,” Hodgson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
