Lubrizol Corp. (LZ)  said billionaire
 Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. agreed to extend its
“outside date” for completing the purchase of the company to
Dec. 31 from Oct. 14.  Lubrizol “continues to expect the closing to occur during
the third quarter of this year,” the Wickliffe, Ohio-based
lubricants maker said in a regulatory filing today. Lubrizol
sought the extension to provide additional time for required
approvals, if necessary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
