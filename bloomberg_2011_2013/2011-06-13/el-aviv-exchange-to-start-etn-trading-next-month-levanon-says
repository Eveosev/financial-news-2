The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange will
list  Israel ’s first exchange-traded notes next month to make it
easier for investors to bet on industry groups, Chief Executive
Officer Ester Levanon said.  The first ETNs will track the energy, telecommunications,
technology and biomedical industries, Levanon said in an
interview at the bourse yesterday.  The Tel Aviv exchange is adding new products to lure
foreign money managers after Israel was upgraded to a developed
market from emerging by index provider MSCI Inc. in May 2010.
Overseas investors sold a net $810 million of Tel Aviv-traded
shares in 2010, compared with $1.7 billion of purchases in 2009,
data compiled by the  Bank of Israel  show.  “As we became a developed market, which is based on
sectors, it became even more important to allow investors to
concentrate on a sector, especially when we are talking about
new foreign investors who are looking at the Israeli market for
the first time,” Levanon said.  Exchange-traded notes are unsecured bank debt whose value
is designed to mirror the performance of an index. They are
backed only by their issuer’s credit, unlike exchange-traded
funds, which hold assets. Levanon didn’t say which companies
will manage the ETNs in  Tel Aviv .  Israel’s benchmark TA-25 Index has declined 9.3 percent
this year compared with a 0.7 percent gain in the MSCI World
Index of developed-market shares. The TA-25 gauge has gained 8.7
percent since the MSCI upgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
