PetroChina Co.’s Changqing oilfield,
it’s second largest, is on course to meet this year’s production
target of 40 million metric tons as the company steps up
drilling, its parent said.  The field, in northwestern  China , produced 17.32 million
metric tons of oil and gas in the first five months of this
year, China National Petroleum Corp. said on its  website  today.
Crude oil output climbed 22 percent to 8.37 million tons from a
year earlier and gas output rose 21 percent to 11.2 billion
cubic meters, the company said.  PetroChina, the nation’s largest oil company, is boosting
reserves and production at its second-largest field as its
oldest and biggest deposit, Daqing, ages. The explorer aims to
increase Changqing’s crude and gas output by 25 percent to 50
million tons by 2015 compared with this year, the official
Xinhua News Agency said Jan. 2.  Crude output at Daqing field in northeastern China’s
Heilongjiang province reached 16.74 million tons during the
period, it said, without giving any comparison. Daqing’s crude
oil output was at 40 million tons last year and gas production
at 3 billion cubic meters, or 2.7 million tons of oil
equivalent, CNPC said Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
