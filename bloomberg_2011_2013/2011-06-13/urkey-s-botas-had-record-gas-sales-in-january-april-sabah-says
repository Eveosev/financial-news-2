Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS,
 Turkey ’s state-owned pipeline company known as Botas, had record
gas sales of 14.7 billion cubic meters from January to April,
 Sabah  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The amount was 3 bcm higher than the targeted volumes for
the period, the newspaper said. Ankara-based Botas aims to sell
29.9 bcm of gas sales this year, it said.  Botas may avoid having to pay  Russia , which supplies more
than half of Turkey’s gas needs, for any unused gas under the
so-called take-or-pay clause in the gas purchase contracts
because of record gas sales forecasts this year, the newspaper
said.  Turkey paid Russia as much as $1.1 billion for the untapped
gas it should have bought under the contract in 2010, Sabah said
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
