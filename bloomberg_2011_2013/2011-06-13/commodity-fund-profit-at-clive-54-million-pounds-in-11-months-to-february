Clive Capital LLP, the London-based
commodity hedge fund company founded by Chris Levett, reported
retained profit of 54.3 million pounds ($88.3 million) in the 11
months ended Feb. 28.  The profit compared with 56.95 million pounds in the full
year ended March 31, 2010, the company said in a filing at U.K.
Companies House. The amount is shared by members, it said.  Profit before members’ remuneration and profit shares was
103.97 million pounds, the filing said. The share attributable
to the member with the largest entitlement, including
remuneration, was 83.9 million pounds, an increase of 12.5
percent, it said.  Clive Capital managed $5.1 billion as of May 1, according
to a document distributed to investors. The firm acts as
investment manager on behalf of Clive Capital (Malta) Ltd. and
received 110.3 million pounds from the Malta-based company for
the period ended Feb. 28, the filing said. Levett is the
“ultimate controlling party,” it said. Two calls seeking
comment from Levett were not returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
