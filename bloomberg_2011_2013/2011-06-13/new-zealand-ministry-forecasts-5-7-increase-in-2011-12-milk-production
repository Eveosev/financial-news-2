New Zealand, the world’s largest
dairy exporter, will increase milk production the next two
seasons as strong demand from  China  and oil-exporting nations
buoys prices and boost supply, according to the government  Production may surge 5.7 percent in the year ending May 31,
2012, the  Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry  said in a report
today. Output may gain 2.9 percent in the 2012-2013 season and
1.2 percent the following year, it said.  China’s dairy imports surged more than five-fold between
2008 and 2010 amid rising incomes and nutrition levels, sending
whole milk powder to a record $4,958 a metric ton on March 1.
Oil-exporting countries are likely to increase their dairy
consumption as oil prices rise, according to the report.  “There’ll be increasingly strong demand for the kinds of
fats and proteins that  New Zealand  produces,” Paul Stocks,
deputy Director-General of the ministry, said on a conference
call in Wellington. Demand will underpin high international
prices and encourage higher milk production, he said.  High prices may encourage New Zealand farmers to switch to
dairy from sheep, beef and arable farming, further boosting
production, according to the report.  To contact the reporter for this story:
