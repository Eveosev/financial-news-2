The pound touched its lowest level
in more than two weeks versus the dollar after the  Bank of
England  said U.K. inflation is “reasonably well anchored” as
policy makers hold borrowing costs at a record low.  Sterling extended last week’s 1.2 percent decline against
the U.S. currency as accountancy firm BDO Stoy Hayward said
Britain’s economic growth will be “unspectacular” this year
and the central bank shouldn’t rule out more bond purchases.
Central bank policy maker  Martin Weale  is due to speak at 7 p.m.
in London.  The pound was little changed at $1.6240 as of 7:35 a.m. in
London after reaching $1.6211, the weakest since May 25. It was
also little changed versus the euro, at 88.35 pence and
strengthened 0.2 percent to 130.63 yen.  Ten-year gilts rose last week amid signs that growth is
weakening, reducing the case for higher U.K. interest rates. The
securities advanced for the ninth successive week, the longest
run since Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1989, as
reports showed factory output contracted more than economists
estimated in April and shop-price inflation slowed in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
