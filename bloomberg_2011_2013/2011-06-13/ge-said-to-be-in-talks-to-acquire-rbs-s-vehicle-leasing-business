Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, is in talks to sell its
vehicle-leasing business to  General Electric Co. (GE) ’s finance unit,
two people familiar with the matter said.  Discussions about RBS’s  Lombard Vehicle Management  are
continuing, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the negotiations are private. GE Capital’s  fleet  of more
than 1 million vehicles worldwide includes in excess of 250,000
autos in  Europe , according to the company.  Unloading Lombard would add to asset sales after RBS took
45.5 billion pounds ($73.7 billion) of government aid in the
2008 financial crisis, the most of any bank in the world. It has
shed bank branches and its credit-card processing unit, and
hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  to prepare to sell its aircraft-
leasing unit, a person familiar with that plan said last month.  Spokesmen for GE, based in Fairfield, Connecticut, and
Edinburgh, Scotland-based RBS declined to comment.  British banks, propped up by about 1 trillion pounds in
capital and guarantees after  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) 
collapsed in 2008, are trying to wean themselves off government
assistance. Regulators have been trying to craft rules that will
allow banks to fail in the future without turning to taxpayers.  Sky News reported the RBS-GE talks yesterday, citing people
it didn’t identify.  To contact the reporters on this story:
