Firefighter deaths in the U.S.
declined in 2010 to the lowest in more than three decades, the
National Fire Protection Association said today.  On-duty deaths in the U.S. dropped to 72 last year from 82
in 2009, the association said today in a statement on its
website. The figure is the lowest since the group began
compiling data in 1977.  To contact the reporter on this story:
