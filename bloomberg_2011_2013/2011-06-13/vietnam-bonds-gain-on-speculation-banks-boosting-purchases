Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained for
a second day on speculation banks are purchasing more government
debt due to an increase in foreign investment.  “According to some data from our investment department,
some commercial banks have received indirect investment from
foreign investors so they may have converted the U.S. dollar
inflow into dong and invested this money into the  bond market ,”
Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at ACB
Securities Inc. wrote in a research note obtained today.  Five-year yields fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 12.71 percent, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The dong was unchanged at 20,550 per
dollar as of 3:35 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the reference rate at 20,618 today,
unchanged from June 10, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the official
rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Sandy Hendry  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
