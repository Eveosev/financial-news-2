     June 13 (Bloomberg.com) -- Good new interview with the head
of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, the well-respected Pat
Mulroy. An excerpt on the Colorado River and whether the U.S. is
still in drought, given  California ’s no-drought declaration:
Is the Drought Over?  John McChesney:  In California, our governor declared that
the drought is over because we had a really good snow pack, you
have a good snowpack in the Rockies this year. What’s going to be
coming downstream from Lake Powell into Lake Mead this year?  Pat Mulroy: In April, under our shortage agreement, in April
of every year Interior has to firm up how much water they will be
releasing from Lake Powell to Lake Mead and over the past eleven
years we have been receiving no more than 8.23 million acre ft.
which is below the demand so Lake Mead’s been dropping. 9.5 go
out of Mead every year and when 8.23 only come in, Mead drops.
This year because of the precipitation that occurred in the upper
basin, Interior has announced that they will release 11.56
million acre ft. from Powell to Mead so Mead will slightly
recover. Much of what happens on a going forward basis is how
much inflow we have in the summer months in the lower basin
tributaries to see where we end up in the year by September 30th
which is the end of the water year. We will be either be at
elevation 1105 or 1089 depending on what the summer monsoons and
summer inflows do for Lake Mead. I would not declare the drought
over on the Colorado River. What I would say is we’ve benefited
from one really good year of hydrology. It avoided the point that
all of us have been dreading which is when the first shortage
declaration is made in lake mead, but it can turn around again
next year.  Serious Consequences  John McChesney: Why the dread? That’s a pretty strong word.  Pat Mulroy: Well, because the further you go down in Lake
Mead the faster your rate of decline. Your risk exposure becomes
that much greater. Once you pass 1075 you’re starting…imagine a
V, you’re starting to get in the lower reaches of the V so the
time it took to get from 1100 to 1075 is longer than it takes to
get from 1075 to 1050. And none of us have, or the states,
haven’t yet had the discussions what do we do if the Lake Mead
drops below 1025. I mean, you have to imagine as it rapidly
approaches elevation 1000, at 1000 Lake Mead, which has a total
capacity of 26 million acre feet, will have less than 5 million
left in the reservoir and an annual demand of 9.5. So the cuts
that were implemented getting from 1075 down to 1025 will be
nothing compared to the cuts that will occur once you get below
1025. To put that in some kind of perspective for you, I mean,
between the states we’ve agreed to cumulative cuts of around
500,000-acre feet by 1025. Below that, in order to stabilize that
reservoir at all, you’re going to have to make cuts from between
3-5 million acre feet of use. Now that gets to have some pretty
serious consequences.  Click here  to see the story as it appeared on Bloomberg.com.
