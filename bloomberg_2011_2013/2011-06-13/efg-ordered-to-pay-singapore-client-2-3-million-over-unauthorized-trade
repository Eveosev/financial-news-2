EFG International AG (EFGN) , the Swiss bank
controlled by Greek billionaire Spiro Latsis and his family, was
ordered by a Singapore judge to pay $2.3 million to a client for
making unauthorized and high-risk trades in her account.  Ng Ton Yee, a former EFG employee, made 160 unauthorized
trades in Jiang Ou’s account with the bank in Singapore,
incurring a loss of $2.3 million, Judge Steven Chong wrote in a
high court  ruling  released today.  The bank had argued that Jiang, a Chinese citizen who
opened a S$5 million ($4 million) account in 2008, was aware of
the trades as she had received the transaction statements. Jiang
said she didn’t get all the trading confirmation slips,
according to the judgment.  “It is plainly unreasonable that a bank should be able to
shift the risk of unauthorized transactions by a fraudulent
employee to an innocent customer,” Chong said.  Jiang was represented by Lawrence Quahe & Woo LLC and
Premier Law LLC acted for the bank.  The case is Jiang Ou v EFG Bank AG S1055/2009 in the
 Singapore  High Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
