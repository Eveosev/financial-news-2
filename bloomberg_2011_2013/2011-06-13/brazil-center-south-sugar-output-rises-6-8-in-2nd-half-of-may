Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, rose 6.8 percent in
the second half of May as farmers accelerated the harvest on dry
weather, industry association Unica said.  Output increased to 2.38 million metric tons between May 16
and May 31, from 2.23 million a year earlier,  Unica  said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Mills in the region turned 46 percent of the cane into
sugar, up from 44.7 percent a year ago, Unica said. The
remainder was processed into ethanol.  Farmers in the Center South, where about 90 percent of
Brazil’s sugar and ethanol is produced, harvested 42.7 million
tons of cane, up 5.5 percent from last year, the association
said. The harvest usually runs from March through November.  Ethanol production rose 1.3 percent in the second half of
May, to 1.72 billion liters (454.3 million gallons).  Brazil is the world’s largest sugar producer.  Latin
America ’s biggest economy accounts for about 54 percent of
world’s exports, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture .  To contact the reporter on this story:
