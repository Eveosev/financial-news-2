Credit-default swaps on  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal  surged to records on concern European
governments’ struggles to resolve the deficit crisis will
threaten their ability to pay their debts.  Swaps on Greece jumped 47 basis points to an all-time high
of 1,610 as of 5:30 p.m. in London after  Standard & Poor’s 
downgraded the nation, according to CMA. Contracts on Ireland
soared 27 basis points to 740, Portugal climbed 22 to 764 and
the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments jumped 7 basis points to 218, approaching the record
221.75 set Jan. 10.  Disagreement between the  European Central Bank  and  Germany 
over bailing out Greece is undermining investor confidence in
the region’s most troubled governments. ECB President Jean- Claude Trichet and German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
are at odds over who should bear the cost of the second Greek
rescue in 14 months. S&P lowered its long-term sovereign credit
rating on the nation to CCC with a negative outlook from B.  “How to make out of a bad situation an awful one seems
what European politicians are currently aiming for,” Anke Richter, a credit strategist at Mizuho International Plc in
London, wrote in a note to investors. “We still believe that
there will likely be an aid package coming forward, but we are
not so sure if the quarrelling of the last weeks will be easily
forgotten by markets.”  Swaps on Italy increased 5 basis points to 178,  Spain  rose
14 to 288 and  Belgium  was 8.5 higher at 161.5.  Greek ‘Defaults’  “In our view Greece is increasingly likely to restructure
its debt in a manner that, under the conditions of any package
of additional funding provided by Greece’s official creditors,
would result in one or more defaults under our criteria,” S&P
said today.  The cost of insuring European corporate bonds also rose.
Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 6 basis points
to 406, after earlier climbing to the highest since March 17,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The index is a benchmark for
the cost of protecting bonds against default and an increase
signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1.75 basis points to 110 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers climbed 0.5 basis points to 165.5 basis
points and the subordinated index was up 4 at 287.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
