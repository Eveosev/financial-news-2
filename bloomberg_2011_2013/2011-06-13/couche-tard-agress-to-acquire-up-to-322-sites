Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. (ATD/B) , the
operator of more than 5,800  convenience stores , agreed to
acquire locations in  California  from ExxonMobil Corp. after a
bid to boost its U.S. presence failed last year.  The acquisition of up to 322 locations will be made through
its subsidiary, Circle K Stores Inc., the Laval, Quebec-based
company said today in a statement. A purchase price wasn’t
disclosed. The companies said the deal will close in stages
starting in the last three months of this year.  Couche-Tard, led by Chief Executive Officer Alain Bouchard,
is renewing expansion efforts eight months after abandoning an
attempt to acquire U.S. convenience chain  Casey’s General Stores
Inc. (CASY)  Couche-Tard currently gets more than three quarters of its
revenue from the U.S.  The Canadian chain had offered $38.50 a share for Casey’s
General, which operates more than 1,500 locations in the U.S.
That failed when Casey’s General shareholders rejected directors
nominated by Couche-Tard.  In the quarter ended Jan. 30, Couche-Tard generated 78
percent of its revenue from the U.S. as total sales rose 14
percent to $5.6 billion.  Couche-Tard rose 33 cents, or 1.2 percent, to C$26.91 at
4:01 p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have gained
40 percent in the past year, compared with an 11 percent gain
for the S&P/Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
