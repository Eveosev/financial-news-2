North Sea loadings of Troll crude
will total 13 cargoes in July, two less than this month,
according to loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News.  Exports of Aasgard crude will be unchanged at seven
cargoes, while Grane loadings will be eight cargoes, one more
than June, the schedules showed.  Troll and Grane shipments are 600,000 barrels each and
Aasgard is 855,000 barrels.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil
and gas producer, operates the three fields.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
