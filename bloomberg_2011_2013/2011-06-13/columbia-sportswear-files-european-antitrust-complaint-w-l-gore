Columbia Sportswear Co. (COLM) , the U.S.
maker of outdoor clothing and footwear, said it filed a European
Union complaint against Gore-Tex maker W.L. Gore & Associates
Inc. for allegedly abusing its dominant market position.  W.L. Gore violates EU competition rules in its sale of
waterproof “breathable membranes” for footwear and gloves,
Columbia and its Italian subsidiary, OutDry Technologies, said
today in a statement. The complaint was filed with the Brussels-
based European Commission, which regulates competition in the
27-nation EU.  Columbia has “long been concerned that W. L. Gore &
Associates’ commercial practices systematically prevent
consumers, brand owners and manufacturers from gaining access to
competing product innovations,” the Portland, Oregon-based
company said in the statement.  The  U.S. Federal Trade Commission  in March subpoenaed W.L.
Gore seeking documents covering a 10-year period as part of an
investigation into whether the company used unfair contracts or
exclusionary practices. W.L. Gore in April filed a  request  to
quash the government request, saying it was “outrageously
overbroad and burdensome.”  A message left at W.L. Gore’s headquarters in  Newark ,
 Delaware , wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
