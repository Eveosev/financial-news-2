Makhteshim-Agan Industries Ltd. (MAIN)  rose
as  Koor Industries Ltd. (KOR)  agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit
paving the way for the completion of a sale of the world’s
largest maker of generic agrochemicals.  The shares of Makhteshim jumped 5.2 percent, the most since
March 30, to 18.51 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. in  Tel Aviv , valuing
the company at 8.1 billion shekels ($2.4 billion). Koor
increased 5.6 percent, the most since Dec. 28, to 67.23 shekels.  Koor, which owns 47 percent of Makhteshim, will pay other
shareholders $45 million to settle the lawsuit, according to a
statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange today. The lawsuit,
filed in January, claimed the distribution of proceeds from the
sale put public shareholders at a disadvantage to Koor.  The settlement is a “win-win situation all around,” Gilad Alper, a senior analyst at Meitav Investment House Ltd. in Tel
Aviv, said by telephone. “It removes the last barrier before
completing the deal.”  China National Chemical Corp. on Dec. 28 agreed to acquire
7 percent of Makhteshim from Koor and offered to buy all the
publicly traded stock to bring its stake to 60 percent in a deal
that valued Makhteshim at $2.4 billion. Koor, which is
controlled by Nochi Dankner’s IDB Holding Corp. and  Discount
Investment Corp. (DISI) , would continue to own 40 percent of
Makhteshhim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
