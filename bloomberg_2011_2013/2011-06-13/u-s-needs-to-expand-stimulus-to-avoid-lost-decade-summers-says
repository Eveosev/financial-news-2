The U.S. government should expand
stimulus by extending a  payroll tax  cut to employers to avoid a
so-called lost decade of stagnation, former U.S. Treasury
Secretary  Lawrence Summers  wrote in the Financial Times.  “Substantial withdrawal of fiscal stimulus at the end of
2011 would be premature,” Summers, now a professor at  Harvard
University , said in an article published in the London-based
newspaper today. “Stimulus should be continued and indeed
expanded by providing the payroll tax cut to employers as well
as employees.”  President  Barack Obama ’s administration, which in January
extended a 2 percentage-point reduction in worker contributions
to the payroll tax during 2011, should also increase it to 3
percentage points, Summers said. The U.S. is “half way to a
lost economic decade” and these measures would “raise the
prospect of sizeable improvement in economic performance over
the next few years,” he said.  “It is far too soon for financial policy to shift toward
preventing future bubbles and possible inflation, and away from
assuring adequate demand,” the former Treasury secretary wrote.  “The fiscal debate must accept that the greatest threat to
our creditworthiness is a sustained period of slow growth,” he
said. “Discussions about medium-term austerity need to be
coupled with a focus on near-term term growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
