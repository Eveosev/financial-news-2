Uganda  raised its tea-production
forecast this year by 9.1 percent because of increasing yields
stemming from wider plantings and use of fertilizers, the Uganda
Tea Association said.  Output in the 12 months through December may rise to 60
million kilograms (132 million pounds), George William
Ssekitoleko, the association’s executive secretary, said today
in an interview in the capital, Kampala. The association in
January forecast a crop of 55 million kilograms, while output
last year was 59.1 million kilograms.  “We are looking at 60 million kilograms this year based on
a positive trend in the last four years due to better farm
management,” Ssekitoleko said. “The impact from this year’s
drought on the crop was marginal.”  Recordings of production in the first five months of this
year fell 45 percent to 14.2 million because “many producers
haven’t filed their returns,” according to preliminary data
provided by the association today. Reported exports declined 44
percent to 12.3 million kilograms in the period because of the
delay by producers in providing data, it said.  Total shipments this year are expected to increase from
53.2 million kilograms in 2010, according to the association.
Details of last year’s export have yet to be compiled,
Ssekitoleko said.  Uganda,  Africa ’s third-biggest tea producer after  Kenya  and
 Malawi , exports around 97 percent of the crop, which is one of
the East African country’s biggest foreign-exchange earners. The
country ships most its leaves through the weekly auction at
 Mombasa  in Kenya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
