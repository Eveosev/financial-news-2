Mozambique may become a signatory to
the  Kimberley Process  by December,  Noticias  reported, citing
Mineral Resources Minister Esperanca Bias.  Bias also said that prospecting by companies and
individuals awarded licenses to explore for the gems were at an
advanced stage, the Maputo-based newspaper said. The government
issued 40 diamond permits to 21 companies and six individuals,
it said, without providing further details.  The Kimberley Process was started in 2003 to stem the trade
in so-called “ blood diamonds ” that fund conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
