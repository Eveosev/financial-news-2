Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest
chipmaker, plans to develop software in Brazil to overcome
language barriers and meet rising local demand for computers,
Steve Long, the company’s general director for Latin America
said.  “We’ll invest in Brazil’s software area in the short
term,” Long, 36, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Sao Paulo
office today. “Possibly by the end of the year we’ll have some
investments and much more next year.”  The  Santa Clara , California-based company plans to tap into
Brazil’s supply of programmers to write local-language software,
Long said. Intel researchers who visited Brazil were satisfied
with the talent available at local universities, he said.  Intel expects to double revenue in Brazil in the next five
years as an expanding economy fuels demand for personal
computers and data centers, he said. Brazil’s gross domestic
product will grow 4 percent this year, according to a central
bank survey, after a 7.5 percent expansion in 2010.  While Intel doesn’t disclose how much revenue comes from
Brazil, the Americas region accounted for 20 percent of sales
last year.  Intel gained 8 cents to $21.46 at 3:28 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It had risen 1.7 percent this
year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
