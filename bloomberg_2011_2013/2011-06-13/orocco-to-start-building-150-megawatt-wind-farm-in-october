     June 13 (Bloomberg) --  Morocco  will start building a wind
farm with a capacity of 150 megawatts in October in the
northeastern province of Taza, the Office National d’Electricite
said in an e-mailed statement, citing project manager Mohammed
el-Khalfi.  The wind farm, which will cost nearly 3 billion dirhams
($380 million) and is scheduled to be operational in 2014, is
the first to be built under a program to construct several
similar wind-powered projects with a total capacity of 1,000
megawatts, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
