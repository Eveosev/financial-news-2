Seacom Ltd., a closely held company
that operates a fiber-optic link off East Africa, said it plans
to extend the cable into Somalia, Burundi and  Southern Sudan 
through partners amid growing demand for Internet services.  “We would like to expand our footprint,” Julius Opio, the
company’s regional head, said by phone from the Kenyan capital,
 Nairobi . He declined to provide further details.  Burundi will be the first to be linked to the cable, once
the central African nation has installed 1,300 kilometers (810
miles) of fiber network next year, he said. The cable would then
be extended to Southern Sudan within a year of its independence,
scheduled for July 9, and then Somalia within the following two
to three years, he said.  The company currently has fiber-optic links in Rwanda,
 Uganda , Tanzania, Ethiopia, Djibouti and  Kenya , where its east
and north African office is based, Opio said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
