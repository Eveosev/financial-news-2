Overseas investors sold a net 4.7
billion rupees ($105.1 million) of Indian stocks on June 10,
paring their investment in the equities this year to 2.02
billion rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 19.7 billion rupees of shares and sold
24.4 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They bought 2.79 billion rupees of bonds, taking
their debt purchases this year to 145.5 billion rupees.  Overseas funds bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. The Sensex has
fallen 10.9 percent this year.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18 years. Funds
pulled out a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.47 trillion rupees in equities and 932.2 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
