Kenya delayed the resumption of
coffee sales by two weeks until June 28 after cold weather
slowed the drying the beans, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  “We won’t have an auction tomorrow because the cold
conditions delayed the drying process,” Chief Executive Officer
Daniel Mbithi said by phone today from the capital, Nairobi.  Kenya started its traditional break in coffee sales earlier
than usual on April 19 because of low supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
