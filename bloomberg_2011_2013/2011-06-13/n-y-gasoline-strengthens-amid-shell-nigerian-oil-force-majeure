New York  gasoline rose after Royal
Dutch Shell Plc’s Nigerian unit declared force majeure on a
light, low sulfur grade used by U.S. East Coast refiners to
produce fuel.  Shell said in an e-mailed statement that loadings for this
month and next must be revised because of multiple pipeline
fires. The East Coast  imported  322,000 barrels of crude a day in
March from Nigeria, about 32 percent of total imports to the
region, according to the most recent Energy Department data.  “The loss of Bonny light will impact part of that supply
and as a result, can drive gasoline prices higher,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor narrowed 2.38 cents to 10.75 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:46
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
rose 2.44 cents to $2.9109 a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  narrowed its discount to
futures 0.35 cent to 14.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
