Serbia’s foreign-exchange reserves
topped 10 billion euros ($14.37 billion) in May for the first
time since February, as the government increased euro borrowing
domestically and drew loan tranches from foreign lenders.  Foreign-exchange reserves rose by a net 112.2 million euros
in May to 10.064 billion euros, the National Bank of Serbia said
in an e-mail today.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , inched up to 5.388 billion euros from 5.37 billion euros
in April, the Belgrade-based  Narodna Banka Srbije  said.  Serbia repaid 10.3 million euros to foreign creditors in
May and 95.1 million euros to locals whose savings were frozen
in the early 1990s and which the government repays through a so-
called savings bond.  Inflows included the government borrowing of 58.9 million
euros on the local market, the central bank’s currency purchases
from banks worth 40 million euros, 15.9 million euros worth of
loans from the  European Investment Bank  and donations worth 5.9
million euros, the bank said.  Interbank trading volumes rose in May to 1.68 billion
euros, increasing by 647.9 million euros from April, while the
January through May interbank trading volumes hit 6 billion
euros, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
