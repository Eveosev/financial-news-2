Lenny Dykstra, the former  New York
Mets  and Philadelphia Phillies outfielder, pleaded not guilty to
charges he stole or destroyed more than $400,000 worth of
property from his bankrupt estate.  Dykstra, 48, entered the plea at his arraignment hearing
today, said  Thom Mrozek , a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s
office in Los Angeles. Trial was set for Aug. 9 before U.S.
District Judge Dean Pregerson, Mrozek said.  The ex- Major League Baseball  player was charged in April.
Prosecutors said he removed, destroyed and sold property from
his $18.5 million mansion after filing for bankruptcy in 2009 in
 California . Dykstra shipped chandeliers, mirrors, artwork and
other items from the mansion to a consignment store, according
to court filings.  Last week, the  Los Angeles  district attorney charged
Dykstra with drug possession and grand theft for allegedly
trying to lease cars using phony business and credit
information.  Dean Gits, a federal public defender assigned to Dykstra’s
bankruptcy-fraud case, didn’t immediately return a call to his
office.  The case is U.S. v. Dykstra, 11-415, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Los Angeles). The bankruptcy
case is In re Dykstra, 09-18409, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Central
District of California (San Fernando Valley).  To contact the reporter on this story:
