Cypress Semiconductor Corp. (CY)  filed a
U.S. trade complaint seeking to block imports of routers and
switches made by Alcatel-Lucent SA, Motorola Solutions Inc. and
Ericsson AB.  The filing with the U.S. International Trade Commission in
 Washington  on June 10 targets products that contain static
random-access memory chips supplied by  GSI Technology Inc. (GSIT) ,
which San Jose, California-based Cypress said infringes four of
its patents. Melville, New York-based  Arrow Electronics Inc. (ARW) ,
which distributes GSI circuits, was also named.  The dispute is over devices used to store instructions or
data, and the Cypress inventions let a large amount of memory be
put on a small cell, according to the complaint. Cypress, which
said it makes its circuits in  Minnesota , is seeking to block
imports of GSI chips made in Taiwan.  Cypress filed a lawsuit against Sunnyvale, California-based
GSI in March, alleging infringement of five patents.  David Chapman, a spokesman for GSI, said the company
doesnâ€™t comment on litigation.  The ITC is an independent agency that investigates claims
of unfair trade practices, including patent infringement. If it
agrees to investigate the Cypress complaint, the review would
likely take 15 to 18 months.  The case is In the Matter of Certain Static Random Access
Memories and Products Containing Same, Complaint No. 2816, U.S.
International Trade Commission (Washington). The civil suit is
Cypress Semiconductor Corp. v. GSI Technology Inc., 11cv789,
U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota ( Minneapolis ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
