The University of  Southern
California  received a $150 million pledge for medical research
from the W. M. Keck Foundation, the third gift of more than $100
million to the school since March.  The private university in  Los Angeles  will rename its
health-care offerings Keck Medicine of USC, which will comprise
a teaching hospital and medical school, it said today in a
 statement  on its website.  “This partnership with USC will fund outstanding research
to expand the boundaries of medical knowledge and improve
quality of life for vast numbers of people,” said Robert Day,
chairman and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles-based
Keck Foundation.  USC has announced more than $600 million in gifts and
pledges since Oct. 15, when C.L. Max Nikias was inaugurated as
its president. On March 9, the university received a pledge of
$200 million from Dana and David Dornsife to support
undergraduate education and on April 27, Julie and John Mork
donated $110 million for scholarships. In a May interview,
Nikias said USC may raise $1 billion by September, when it will
announce a fundraising campaign.  The  Keck Foundation  was established in 1954 by William Keck,
founder of the Superior Oil Co. Superior was acquired in 1984 by
Mobil Oil, now part of  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , based in Irving,  Texas .
The foundation gave $110 million to USC’s medical school in 1999.  USC, founded in 1880, has about 35,000 students and is the
largest private, not-for-profit U.S. university on the West
Coast. Its former students include astronaut Neil Armstrong and
actor  John Wayne .  To contact the reporter on this story:
