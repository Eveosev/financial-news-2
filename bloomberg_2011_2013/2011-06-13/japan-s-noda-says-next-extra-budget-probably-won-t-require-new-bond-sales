An extra budget that the Japanese
government will draft next month probably won’t require bond
sales as it will likely be followed by a larger package to spend
for reconstruction, Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  ordered the government to put
together a plan for the budget by early July to pay for measures
not included in the 4 trillion yen ($50 billion) first extra
budget approved by parliament in May, Noda told reporters at a
news conference today in Tokyo.  “We will have to find financial sources other than bond
issuance as we don’t have enough time to discuss issuing bonds
and how it should be funded,” Noda said. The next budget may
pay for measures such as helping indebted households that need
to borrow more money to rebuild after the March earthquake and
tsunami, he said.  Noda said there will be “multiple” extra budgets, with
measures to fund quake rebuilding needing to await
recommendations from a panel advising Kan on reconstruction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
