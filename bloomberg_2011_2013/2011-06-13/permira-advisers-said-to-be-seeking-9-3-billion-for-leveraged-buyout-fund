Permira Advisers LLP, the owner of
British clothing retailer New Look Group, plans to raise a 6.5
billion-euro ($9.33 billion) private equity fund, a third less
than its last pool, a person briefed on the matter said.  The company, which is still investing the earlier 9.6
billion-euro fund, told investors last week it will start
raising the money by end of August, said the person who declined
to be identified because the talks are private.  Private equity firms such as London-based Permira,  Apax
Partners  LLP and Cinven Ltd. are scaling back the amount they’re
seeking from investors after the credit crisis brought deal-
making to a near-halt for two years. Investors are reluctant to
commit fresh capital before receiving profits from previous
investments, executives say.  Permira ’s 2006 pool is valued at “close to par” after
being marked down by as much as 60 percent in December 2008, Co-
Managing Partner Kurt Bjorklund said in a February interview.
Permira cut the size of the fund to 9.6 billion euros from 11.1
billion euros that month, when falling markets and a drought of
takeovers forced investors to scale back commitments. The firm
has until September 2012 to spend the remaining 1.5 billion
euros in the fund, he said.  Officials at the firm declined to comment. The firm’s plans
were reported earlier today by the Financial Times.  Apax Partners, manager of the largest European private
equity fund, is seeking 9 billion euros, 20 percent less than
the 11.2 billion-euro pool raised in 2007. Cinven, the owner of
the Pizza Express restaurant chain, plans to raise 5 billion
euros, less than the 6.5 billion-euro pool it raised in 2006.  Buyout firms raised $225 billion last year, the least since
2004, according to London-based research firm Preqin Ltd. They
may raise more than $300 billion this year, Preqin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
