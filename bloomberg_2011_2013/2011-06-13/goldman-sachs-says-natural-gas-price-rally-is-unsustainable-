(Corrects recommendation in fourth paragraph of story
published June 13.)  Investors should sell October
natural gas futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  because
a 12 percent rally in prices over the past three weeks is
“unsustainable,” according to Goldman Sachs Group.  The fuel’s discount to coal has narrowed 35 percent
compared with March and a smaller amount of substitution of coal
with natural gas may take place at current prices, Goldman’s
London-based analysts, Samantha Dart and Johan Spetz, said in a
report e-mailed today. Producers switch between gas-fired
generators and coal units depending on fuel costs.  Natural gas for July delivery in New York rose 0.1 percent
to $4.761 per million British thermal units at 3:45 p.m.
Singapore time. Prices are 8.1 percent higher this year and have
gained 13 percent from May 20.  Prices above $5 per million British thermal units will also
prompt producers to raise output, increasing U.S. supplies, the
analysts said. The bank recommended selling  New York  gas futures
at an initial price of $4.84 per million British thermal units.  Goldman also recommended purchasing fourth-quarter 2012
U.K. gas contracts, as a tightening of global LNG markets may
result in a “reconnection between spot prices and oil-indexed
prices in  Europe ,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
