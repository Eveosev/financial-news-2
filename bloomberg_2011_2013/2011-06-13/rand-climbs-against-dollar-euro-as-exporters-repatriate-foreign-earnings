The rand strengthened for the first
time in four days against the dollar as exporters repatriated
foreign earnings on expectations price swings in the South
African currency will lessen in coming weeks.  The rand climbed as much as 0.5 percent to 6.7693 per
dollar and traded 0.2 percent stronger at 6.7915 at 3:48 p.m. in
Johannesburg. It declined less than 0.1 percent to 9.7685 per
euro after strengthening as much as 0.6 percent earlier.  The three-month implied volatility of the rand versus the
dollar has dropped 35 basis points, or 0.035 percentage point,
in the past two weeks to 14.72 percent, indicating currency
options traders expect price swings to narrow over the next
year. The rand’s three-month implied volatility versus the euro
has declined 82 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, since
May 13 to 12.88 percent, the most volatile among emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “We’ve seen some exporter selling of dollars, which has
created demand for rand,” Ian Cruickshanks, head of treasury
strategic research at Johannesburg-based Nedbank Capital, a unit
of  South Africa ’s fourth-biggest bank, said by phone.  The rand’s moves also reflected investor concern over the
progress in talks about a sovereign-debt bailout for  Greece ,
 John Cairns  and Nema Ramkhelawan, currency strategists at Rand
Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a research note.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  and
German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  are at odds over
whether Greek bondholders should be compelled to incur losses in
the nation’s second bailout in 14 months. The euro traded near
its weakest level this month against the dollar and declined
against 12 of its 16 most-traded counterparts today.  ‘Voluntary’ Participation  Greece is seeking its second bailout in as many years and
Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-
area finance ministers, said June 11 any additional financial
aid must include “voluntary” investor participation and meet
the approval of central bankers.  “Long euro positions lessened towards the end of last week
as the ECB reiterated its distaste for Greek debt
restructuring,” Cairns and Ramkhelawan wrote.  Bonds declined for a fourth successive trading day. The
13.5 percent notes due 2015 slipped 9 cents to 121.41 rand,
boosting the yield two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 7.50 percent. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 fell 14
cents to 89.51 rand, driving the yield two basis points higher
to 8.34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
