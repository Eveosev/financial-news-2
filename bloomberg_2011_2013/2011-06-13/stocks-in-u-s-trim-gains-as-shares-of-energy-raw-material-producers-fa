U.S. stocks trimmed gains as
declines in oil and metal prices dragged down commodity
producers, wiping out most of an early advance triggered by
mergers and acquisitions.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to 1,272.4
at 11:09 a.m. in  New York  after climbing 0.5 percent earlier.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 12.56 points, or 0.1
percent, to 11,964.47, paring a 60-point advance. Oil lost 0.9
percent to $98.37 a barrel and copper retreated 0.8 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
