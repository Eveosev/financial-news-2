The U.S. Supreme Court turned away a
bid by coal companies led by  Consol Energy Inc. (CNX)  for a refund of
some of the fees they have put into a government fund that pays
for the restoration of land scarred by mining.  The justices today rejected an industry appeal, also
pressed by units of Massey Energy Co.,  Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX) ,  Alpha
Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) ,  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) ,  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Teco Energy Inc. (TE) 
and  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU)   The companies argued unsuccessfully that the fees were
being applied to coal destined for shipment abroad, violating
the constitutional prohibition on export taxes. A lower court
said the fees were being imposed on coal as it was being
extracted, not as it was being exported.  The companies were seeking both a halt to the fee and
refunds.  Tom Goldstein , the lawyer representing the companies at
the Supreme Court, declined to say how much money they were
seeking.  The case is Consolidation Coal v. United States, 10-1020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
