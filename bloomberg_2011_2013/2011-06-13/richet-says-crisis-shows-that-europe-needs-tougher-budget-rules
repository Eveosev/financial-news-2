European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said the euro-area sovereign debt crisis
shows the region needs tougher economic and budget rules.  “The economic-governance framework devised in the 1990s
has not been implemented and, in any case, has proved too weak
during the crisis,” Trichet said in a speech delivered at the
London School of Economics today. “The crisis has exposed a
clear need for strong reform.”  European policy makers are debating how to strengthen
legislation after three euro-area countries,  Greece , Ireland,
Portugal, required a bailout. Trichet is currently embroiled in
a stand-off with German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  over
investors’ possible role in the second Greek rescue in just over
a year.  “The existing economic-governance framework has been
incorrectly implemented and, more importantly, has proved to be
insufficiently binding while lacking appropriate
comprehensiveness,” Trichet said.  The ECB wants tougher budget rules with “faster and more
automatic sanctions” for those breaching European Union
guidelines on budget deficits, Trichet said. France and  Germany 
have said that penalties against budget violators should be left
in political hands.  “The experience of the past months has vividly
demonstrated the importance of a timely correction of internal
and external imbalances,” Trichet said.  He also called on governments to “bring national policies
in line with membership of a currency union.”  -- Editors: Fergal O’Brien, Eddie Buckle  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
