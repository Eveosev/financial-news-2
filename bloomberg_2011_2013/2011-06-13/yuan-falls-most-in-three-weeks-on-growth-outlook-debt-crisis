China ’s yuan declined the most in
three weeks as signs the global economic recovery is losing
traction damped demand for emerging-market assets.  A “perfect storm” of fiscal woe in the U.S., a slowdown
in China, European debt restructuring and stagnation in  Japan 
may converge on the global economy, New York University
professor Nouriel Roubini said. A bailout for  Greece  must
include “voluntary” investor participation, Jean-Claude Juncker said June 11. Consumer prices rose 5.5 percent last
month from a year earlier, the fastest pace since July 2008,
according a Bloomberg News survey before data due tomorrow.  “Worries on global economic growth and the euro debt
crisis have overshadowed speculation that China will raise
 interest rates ,” said Edmond Law, deputy head of foreign-
exchange at BWC Capital Markets in Hong Kong.  The yuan slipped 0.1 percent to 6.4864 per dollar as of
10:28 a.m. in  Shanghai , the biggest decline since May 23,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The
currency reached 6.4755 on June 8, the strongest level since
China unified official and market exchange rates at the end of
1993. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.07 percent
to 6.4835.  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s reference rate
0.06 percent weaker at 6.4892 per dollar. The yuan isn’t allowed
to move more than 0.5 percent on either side of the daily
fixing.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.08 percent
to 6.3935 per dollar in  Hong Kong . The contracts are at a 1.4
percent premium to the onshore spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s inflation in June may exceed 6 percent, the China
Securities Journal reported today, citing Zhang Zhuoyuan, an
economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Rapid
investment growth and excessive lending are fueling price
increases, the paper reported citing Zhang.  To contact the reporter on this story:
