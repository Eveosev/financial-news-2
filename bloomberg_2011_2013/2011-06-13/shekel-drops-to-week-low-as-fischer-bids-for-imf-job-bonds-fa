Israel ’s 10-year government bond
yields rose to the highest level in a month and the shekel fell
amid concern about Israel’s ability to maintain economic
stability as central bank governor  Stanley Fischer  bid for the
International Monetary fund’s top job.  The country recovered from the global recession faster than
many other developed economies during Fischer’s tenure, with
growth of 4.7 percent in the first quarter of 2011 and 7.6
percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. The economy is likely to
expand 5.2 percent this year and 4.2 percent in 2012, the
central bank said in a June 1 forecast.  “The probability of Fischer leaving the country is gaining
momentum in the market,”  Rafael Gozlan , chief economist at
Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by telephone. “As
this is creating uncertainty about the state of the economy and
the question of Fischer’s replacement, the  risk premium  for
Israel and yields are going up.”  The yield on Israel’s 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit bond due
January 2020 rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point,
to 5.19 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, the highest
since May 11. The shekel weakened as much as 0.9 percent to
3.4394 per dollar, and was down 0.2 percent at 3.4135 at 5:10
p.m. in Tel Aviv.  Fischer, 67, is betting his experience and a shortage of
candidates will prompt IMF members to waive an age requirement
that would exclude him from the position, a person familiar with
the situation said yesterday. French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  and Mexican central bank chief Agustin Carstens also are
running.  Government Auction  “At the end of the day, the country’s economy doesn’t
depend on any one person,” Sagi Stein, chief executive officer
of Migdal  Mutual Funds , said in a telephone interview yesterday.
“I don’t believe it would harm the economy” if Fischer left,
he said.  Israel’s Ministry of Finance raised a total of 1.35 billion
shekels ($395.3 million) at debt auctions today.  It sold 250 million shekels of inflation-linked bonds due
in June 2013 paying a coupon of 0.5 percent, according to
ministry data on Bloomberg. The government also sold 300 million
shekels of bonds maturing in August 2016 and 200 million shekels
of floating-rate notes due in May 2020. It plans to sell 1.35
billion shekels in  government securities  on June 20 and 1.2
billion shekels on June 27, bringing the total sales this month
to 3.9 billion shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
