Andy Murray  started Wimbledon
preparations with his second title in the Aegon Championships at
the Queen’s Club in London.  The Briton, ranked fourth on the ATP World Tour, defeated
 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga  of France, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 today. The
match had been postponed by a day because of rain.  Murray, who also won the title in 2009, is the first
British player to win multiple championships at the Queen’s Club
since Francis Gordon Lowe triumphed in 1913, 1914 and 1925, the
ATP said.  Murray had entered Queen’s after he made his first
semifinals at the French Open, where he lost to eventual
champion  Rafael Nadal  of Spain.  Wimbledon, the third Grand Slam event of the season, starts
at the All England Club next week. The last British man to win
one of the sport’s four major titles was  Fred Perry , who
captured the U.S. National Championships in 1936. Murray reached
the semifinals in Wimbledon the past two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
