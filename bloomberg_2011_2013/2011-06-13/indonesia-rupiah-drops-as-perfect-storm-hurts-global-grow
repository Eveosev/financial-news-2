Indonesia’s rupiah retreated from
near a seven-year high as signs the global economic recovery is
losing momentum heightened  risk aversion , damping demand for
emerging-market assets.  Offshore investors were net sellers of Indonesian shares
last week, disposing of $186 million more stocks than they
bought, according to exchange data. A “perfect storm” of
fiscal woe in the U.S., a slowdown in  China , European debt
restructuring and stagnation in Japan may damage the global
economy,  Nouriel Roubini , the New York University professor who
predicted the global financial crisis, said in a June 11
interview in Singapore.  “The debt crisis in  Europe  is not over yet and America’s
economy is still uncertain,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of
treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “That’s causing
negative sentiment. What affects regional markets will affect
the rupiah as well.”  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 8,530 per dollar as of
9:39 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It reached 8,499 on June 8, the strongest level since March 2004.  Retail sales in the U.S., the third-largest buyer of non-
oil exports from  Indonesia  in April, will drop 0.5 percent in
May from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey before data due tomorrow. That
would be the first decline in 11 months.  Indonesia’s 10-year benchmark bonds were little changed,
with the yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 holding at
7.37 percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
