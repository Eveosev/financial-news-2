Spain ’s energy regulator proposed
that power companies not receive the full value of 7 billion
euros ($10 billion) of power-tariff debt they plan to sell to a
government-backed investment vehicle.  The proceeds should be reduced to achieve an “equilibrium”
between the government, consumers and the companies, which all
bear the burden of financing the power-rate deficit, the
Comision Nacional de Energia said in a report on  its website .  “This Commission considers there should be an adjustment
in the price that companies receive,” the report dated April 28
said.  The 7 billion euros of debt is a portion of the total on
the books of  Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,  Endesa SA (ELE) ,  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  and EON
AG that the utilities were authorized by the government to sell.
The sale reimburses them for subsidizing energy prices to
consumers over the last decade. Iberdrola is Spain’s largest
power supplier and its biggest producer of renewable energy.  The Spanish utilities have already sold 7 billion euros of
the debt to the tariff-deficit amortization fund, known as FADE.  Under Spanish law power companies are obliged to lend cash
to consumers to cover the gap between government-controlled
power prices and the government-approved cost of delivering
electricity.  The so-called tariff deficit it paid back over 15 years
from power bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
