The Beijing- Shanghai  bullet train,
opening later this month, will offer coach-class tickets for a
less-than-expected 555 yuan ($86), boosting the threat to local
airlines on their busiest route.  One-way trips in the two different premium classes will
cost from 935 yuan and 1,750 yuan on 300 kilometers-per-hour
(186 miles per hour) services, Vice Rail Minister Hu Yadong told
reporters today in Beijing. The line will move about 180,000
passengers a day initially, he said.  Fares on three existing bullet-train lines will also be
reduced by 5 percent as the ministry slows trains to 300 kph to
pare operating costs and boost passenger numbers, Hu said.
Beijing Capital International Airport Co. fell in Hong Kong
trading and  Air China Ltd. (753)  and  China  Eastern Airlines Corp.
dropped in Shanghai on concern the 1,318-kilometer Beijing-
Shanghai high-speed line will lure travelers from planes.  “The ticket price is competitive and it will attract some
passengers from airlines,” said Li Lei, an analyst with China
Securities Co. in Beijing. “Whether the train can retain
travelers will depend on the service levels.”  The line will run 90 services a day each way, including
cheaper ones traveling at 250 kph. Operations will begin by the
end of the month, Hu said without specifying a date. Ticket
sales will start a week before the services. The 221 billion-
yuan high-speed rail link is designed to carry 80 million
passengers a year.  Price Pressure  “The lower-than-expected ticket price is a bit of a
positive,” said Gary Wong, an analyst at Guotai Junan
Securities Co. “But the operators are facing big pressure to
cut prices further.”  Trains will be slowed on the Wuhan-Guangzhou, Zhengzhou-
Xian and Shanghai-Nanjing lines from July 1 to pare costs, Hu
said.  Zhao Jian, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University,
which specializes in railways, said this month that standard
tickets on the Beijing-Shanghai line would likely cost more than
600 yuan.  The 300 kph trains will travel from Beijing to Shanghai in
less than five hours. A flight takes about two hours, excluding
travel time to airports and waits for check-in. About 25 percent
of Chinese flights also suffer delays.  Air China, the biggest carrier in Beijing, is advertising
June 19 flights to Shanghai from 410 yuan on its  website .
Carriers will offer an average of more than 20,000 seats a day
on the route this month, the seventh-highest tally worldwide,
based on data from OAG Aviation Solutions.  Beijing Airport Shares  Beijing Airport dropped 0.6 percent to HK$3.53 in  Hong Kong ,
after earlier declining as much as 12 percent. In Shanghai, Air
China declined 2.1 percent to 8.97 yuan and  China Eastern , the
biggest airline in the city, fell 1.8 percent to 5.04 yuan. Both
carriers closed little changed in Hong Kong.  To ensure safety on the new Beijing-Shanghai line, the
operator will undertake at least four hours of inspections every
night, Hu said. A train with no passengers onboard will also be
run along the line first thing every morning as well, he said.  The new line will contribute to a 9.6 percent increase in
China’s railway passenger capacity from July 1, Hu said. Cargo
capacity will rise by 6 percent, he said.  The ministry also reiterated plans to spend 2.8 trillion
yuan on railways in the five years ending 2015. That will boost
the total network to about 120,000 kilometers, said Hu.  “Investments won’t be reduced,” he said. “The pace of
development won’t be slowed.”  --Tian Ying. Editors: Vipin V. Nair, Dave McCombs  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
