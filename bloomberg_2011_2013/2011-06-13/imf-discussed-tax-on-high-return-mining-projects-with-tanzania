The  International Monetary Fund 
backs additional taxes on mining projects with “particularly
high” returns and has held talks with the Tanzania’s Finance
Ministry about the issue, an IMF official said.  “The IMF supports the idea of what we call a resource rent
tax on mining projects,” John Wakeman-Linn, the IMF’s
representative in the East African country, commented in an e-
mailed response to questions today from  Dar es Salaam , the
commercial capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
