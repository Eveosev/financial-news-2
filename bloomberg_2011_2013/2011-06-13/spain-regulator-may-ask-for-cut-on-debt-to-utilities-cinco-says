Spain â€™s energy regulator may propose
a cut in the amount of debt it owes power producers for
subsidized tariffs they charge to reduce the cost of repaying
the money using bond sales,  Cinco Dias  reported.  Consumers face 30.87 billion euros ($44.3 billion) in
financing costs by 2026 based on the interest being paid by the
first three bond issues backed by power bills sold to investors,
the newspaper said, citing calculations in a document drafted by
CNE, the watchdog agency.  Power producers faced added costs not covered by revenue of
13.7 billion euros as of December 31 and may have a shortfall of
as much as 7.5 billion euros from 2011 to 2013, Cinco Dias said.  Spanish electricity consumers paid lower rates than were
approved for utilities for the past five years, creating a so-
called tariff deficit that the government promised to cover.  To contact the reporter on this story:
