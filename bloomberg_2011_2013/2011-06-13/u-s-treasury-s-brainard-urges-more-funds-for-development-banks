The Treasury Department’s
undersecretary for international affairs,  Lael Brainard , urged
Congress to authorize more funds for developments banks or face
a decline in U.S. influence at institutions such as the World
Bank.  Congress has yet to approve the Treasury Department’s  $3.4
billion  international aid budget for next year, which includes
funding for a capital increase at four development banks and for
the World’s Bank’s unit for the poorest nations.  “If we do not secure congressional authorization for
recapitalizing and replenishment of these multilateral
institutions, U.S. leadership will wane,” Brainard said in an
 advance copy  of her testimony scheduled for tomorrow to the
House Financial Services Committee panel that oversees
development banks.  Brainard said that not agreeing to capital increases would
threaten the U.S. veto at the  World Bank  and reduce the U.S.
share by two-thirds at the African Development Bank, just when
the  Middle East  and North Africa are undergoing “historic
transformations.”  The discussion comes as President Barack Obama’s
administration negotiates with Republicans, who control the
 House of Representatives , over cutting the federal government’s
long-term budget shortfall and raising the debt ceiling.  To contact the reporters on this story:
