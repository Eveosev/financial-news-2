Washington  Governor Christine Gregoire said she won’t seek a third term.  Gregoire, 64, a Democrat first elected in 2004, announced
her intentions today at a briefing for reporters at the
governor’s mansion in Olympia, the state capital.  “After much thought and discussion, I know it’s the right
decision for me and my family,” Gregoire said in a statement.  Gregoire, who began her career in public service as a
prison-system typist in 1969, has steered the state through the
longest recession since the Great Depression. She was elected
attorney general in 1992 and served in that capacity until she
won the state’s top elective office.  “I applaud Governor Gregoire for her decades of
outstanding service to the people of Washington,” President
 Barack Obama  said today in a statement. “Governor Gregoire has
demonstrated relentless determination in her efforts to foster
economic growth, strengthen the communities she serves and
improve the lives of millions of Americans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
