OAO Acron (AKRN)  will make phosphate at the
Russian fertilizer producer’s project in Murmansk region from
July, and study setting up rare earth output at the site.  The company, based in Velikiy Novgorod, plans to achieve
full capacity for production of apatite concentrate, a form of
phosphate, at the Oleniy Ruchey project by the end of the year,
its press office said today by phone, citing comments by
Chairman Alexander Popov at a ceremony at the facility.  Acron is also studying producing rare earth metals such as
neodimium and lanthanum from ore at the site, the office said.  Acron, a nitrogen fertilizer maker controlled by Russian
billionaire Viatcheslav Kantor, is diversifying into phosphates
and potash to be self-sufficient in the production of so-called
NPK complex fertilizers. The company is seeking investors for a
29 percent share of its Talitsky potash project in Perm region
after VEB, Russia’s state development bank chaired by  Vladimir
Putin , agreed to buy 20 percent of the deposit in December and
provide a $1.1 billion loan for development, the office said.  Acron will spend $400 million by 2015 to build an ammonia
plant with a 700,000 metric ton capacity at its main production
site in Velikiy Novgorod after opening on March 31 a $95 million
urea factory that can process 335,000 tons, boosting capacity
almost 75 percent, it said in a regulatory filing today.  Rio Tinto Group has an option to raise its stake in North
Atlantic Potash Inc., a venture with Acron that has exploration
and mining licenses in  Canada ’s Saskatchewan province, to 80
percent from 40 percent, the press office said. Even 20 percent
is enough for Acron to be self-sufficient in potash, it said.  The Rio stake was reported earlier by Interfax.  To contact the reporters on this story:
