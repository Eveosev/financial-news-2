Dell Inc. (DELL) , the world’s third-largest
maker of personal computers, agreed to buy closely held Wyse
Technology Inc. for an undisclosed sum to gain desktop devices
used by cloud-computing customers.  The acquisition of Wyse, which has shipped more than 20
million units of its devices worldwide, will boost earnings in
the second half of fiscal year 2013, Round Rock, Texas-based
Dell said today in a statement. Wyse is based in  San Jose ,
California.  “A deal for Wyse makes strategic sense for Dell as a way
to leverage its massive installed base of PCs,” like moving to
virtualization of networks on desktops, said  Brian Marshall , an
analyst with ISI Group in San Francisco, in a note to investors.
He has a neutral rating on the shares.  Dell has been using acquisitions to diversify and become a
bigger supplier of equipment and software used in corporate data
centers, while cutting back on its less profitable line of
consumer products. The company in February hired CA Inc. Chief
Executive Officer John Swainson to oversee the push.  Dell’s shares rose less than a percent to $16.62 at 9:39
a.m. in  New York . The shares have gained 16 percent in the 12
months before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
