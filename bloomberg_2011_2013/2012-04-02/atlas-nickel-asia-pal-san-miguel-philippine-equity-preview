Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Philippine (PASHR)  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading in  Manila .  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  fell 0.4 percent to
5,038.92.  Jollibee Foods Corp. (JFC)  , the nation’s biggest
restaurant operator, climbed 3.5 percent to 117 pesos, the
biggest gainer on the benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index.
The stock was rated overweight with a 135 peso share-price
target at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Investors should own a greater
proportion of the stock than benchmark indexes as the company’s
expansion in  China  will boost margins, according to JPMorgan in
a report today.  Philex Mining Corp. (PX)  , the largest Philippine copper
producer, fell 1.9 percent to 20.75 pesos, the most since Feb.
14. Copper declined for a second day, losing as much as 1.3
percent to $8,500 a metric ton in  London , as increasing
stockpiles signaled weaker demand.  TKC Steel Corp. (T)  , a producer and seller of metals,
rose 2.9 percent to 2.51 pesos, the sharpest advance since March
22. The Philippine company said it plans to buy a 70 percent
stake in a mining venture in Occidental Mindoro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
