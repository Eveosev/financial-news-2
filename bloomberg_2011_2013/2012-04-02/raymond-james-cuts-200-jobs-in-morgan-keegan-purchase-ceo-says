Raymond James  Financial Inc.
dismissed more than 200 employees as the wealth-management firm
completed its acquisition of Morgan Keegan & Co., according to
Chief Executive Officer  Paul Reilly .  Morgan Keegan employees accounted for about two-thirds of
the job cuts and the rest worked for St. Petersburg, Florida-
based Raymond James, Reilly said today in a phone interview.  The reductions were “a lot smaller than we all
predicted,” he said. “Most of those were in fixed income or
equity capital markets, where you just had the same people doing
the exact same jobs with the exact same clients.”  Raymond James, which paid about $1.2 billion to buy
Memphis, Tennessee-based Morgan Keegan from  Regions Financial
Corp. (RF) , now has 6,500 financial advisers in 2,600 locations
across the U.S., the acquiring firm said today in a statement
announcing the completion of the deal.  “Our focus will still be and will continue to be to look
at niche acquisitions -- small teams, small businesses that can
either fill holes or grow us, or hiring people one by one,”
Reilly said. “We don’t plan to be any less aggressive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
