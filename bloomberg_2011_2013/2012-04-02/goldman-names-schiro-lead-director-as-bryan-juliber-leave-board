Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  named James
J. Schiro to be lead director on its board as John H. Bryan and
Lois D. Juliber step down from the panel.  Schiro, a board member since 2009 and formerly chief
executive officer of  Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) , also will be
chairman of the corporate governance and nominating committee,
New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in a statement.  Bryan, 75, won’t stand for re-election in accordance with
the firm’s retirement policy, Goldman Sachs said. Juliber also
won’t seek another term “as a result of increasing time
commitments associated with her other activities,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
