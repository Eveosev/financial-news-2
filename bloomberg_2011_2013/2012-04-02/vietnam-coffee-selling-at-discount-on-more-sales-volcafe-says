Buyers of coffee from  Vietnam , the
world’s biggest producer of the robusta variety, were getting a
discount for the beans last week as sales accelerated, according
to Volcafe, a unit trader of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Vietnamese beans for April and May shipments were $10 a
metric ton below the price on the NYSE Liffe exchange in  London ,
after being at a premium of $10 a ton the previous week, the
Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader said in a report to clients
e-mailed March 30.  “Differentials for prompt shipments were under some
pressure this week as physical sales picked up again,” Volcafe
said. Differentials refer to the discount or premium paid to
obtain beans in relation to the futures price.  Farmers in Vietnam have sold about 70 percent of the crop,
the trader said in the report. Production will be 22.1 million
bags in the season started in October, Volcafe estimates. A bag
of coffee weighs 132 pounds (60 kilograms).  In  Indonesia , the world’s third-largest robusta grower,
coffee supplies improved and harvesting has “kicked in
properly,” Volcafe said in the report. The start of
the season this month has had “very little impact” on prices.  Indonesian beans for April and May shipments were $100 a
ton above the price on NYSE Liffe, Volcafe data show. That’s
down from a premium of $120 a ton the previous week, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
