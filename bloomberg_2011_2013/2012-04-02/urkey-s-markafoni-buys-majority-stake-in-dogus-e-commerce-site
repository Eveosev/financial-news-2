Markafoni, a Turkish private
shopping network, bought a majority stake in e-commerce website
Enmoda.com from billionaire Ferit Sahenk’s Dogus Yayin Grubu AS,
Markafoni chief executive Sina Afra said today.  Markafoni will own 75 percent of the site and Dogus will
retain 25 percent, Afra said by telephone. He declined to
disclose financial terms of the deal, saying they were
confidential.  The acquisition will allow Markafoni to benefit from
Dogus’s media position while creating a full price in-season
fashion site to complement Markafoni.com, which offers end-of-
season fashion products at discounts of as much as 90 percent,
Afra said.  Dogus Yayin Grubu bought Star TV from  Dogan Yayin Holding
AS (DYHOL)  last November for $327 million. The group is owned by Dogus
Holding AS, which has a 25 percent stake in  Turkey ’s largest
listed bank by market value,  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS. (GARAN)   Dogus signed an accord with Korea’s SK Planet in January to
cooperate in e-commerce ventures, according to a statement from
the two companies on Jan. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
