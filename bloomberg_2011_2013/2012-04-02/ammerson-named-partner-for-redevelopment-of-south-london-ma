Hammerson Plc (HMSO) , the U.K.’s third-
largest publicly traded property company, signed an agreement
with Royal  London  Asset Management Ltd. and Irish Bank
Resolution Corp.’s  IBRC Assurance unit  to manage and redevelop
the Whitgift Centre shopping mall in south London.  The Whitgift Centre has about 580,000 square feet (53,900
square meters) of retail space including 154 shops, department
stores and a supermarket, according to a statement from Royal
London and IBRC today. It attracts about 28 million shoppers a
year.  Hammerson already owns  Centrale  Shopping Centre in Croydon,
south London, which it bought last year for 98 million pounds
($130 million). IBRC’s private clients bought 50 percent of the
Whitgift Centre in 2005 and may miss payments on a 171 million-
pound loan used to make the purchase, the bank said in a report
to investors obtained by Bloomberg News last month.  Combining Centrale and Whitgift “will create a unique
opportunity to bring about a game-changing event for the benefit
the whole town,” Royal London and Dublin-based IBRC said in the
statement.  “We have a vision to kick start the much needed retail-led
regeneration of Croydon,” Lawrence Hutchings, London-based
Hammerson’s U.K. retail managing director, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
