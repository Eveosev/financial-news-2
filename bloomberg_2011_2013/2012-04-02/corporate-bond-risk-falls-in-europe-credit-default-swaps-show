The cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign an corporate debt fell, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell six basis points to 275
at 11:40 a.m. in London.  Spain  dropped 18 basis points to 471,
the lowest in more than two weeks. A decline signals improvement
in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 12.5
basis points to 662.5.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was down 2.5 at 142.5 basis points. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers declined 6.5 basis points to 249.5 and the
subordinated gauge was 3.5 lower at 414.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
