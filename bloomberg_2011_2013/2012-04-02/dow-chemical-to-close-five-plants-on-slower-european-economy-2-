Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S.
chemical maker, will close or idle five factories, cancel some
investments and cut 900 jobs because of the European economic
crisis.  The closures are expected to occur within two years and
will save about $250 million annually, Dow said today in a
statement. The company will take $350 million in first-quarter
charges related to asset impairments and write-offs, severance
and other costs related to the actions.  Dow is shifting resources from the European economy to
faster growing businesses,  Andrew Liveris , chairman and chief
executive officer of Midland, Michigan-based Dow said in the
statement.  Europe ’s unemployment rate rose to a 14-year high of
10.8 percent in February as the region’s fiscal crisis forces
companies to cut jobs and pushes economies from  Spain  to Ireland
into recessions.  “These actions, while difficult, are in full alignment
with our commitment to continually manage our portfolio to adapt
to changing and volatile economic conditions, as we are seeing
particularly in Western Europe,” Liveris said.  Styrofoam insulation factories in Estarreja, Portugal;
Balatonfuzfo, Hungary; and Charleston, Illinois, will be shut,
and another in Terneuzen, The Netherlands, will be idled,
according to the statement. A plant in Camacari, Brazil, that
makes toluene diisocyanate, used in flexible foams for
furniture, also will close, Dow said.  The job cuts affect 1.7 percent of the 51,705 people Dow
employed as of Dec. 31.  Dow rose 1 percent to $34.97 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
