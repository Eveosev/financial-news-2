Giorgio Chinaglia, a former member
of the Italian national soccer team who scored 243 goals in 256
career games with the New York Cosmos in the 1970s and 1980s,
died yesterday at the age of 65.  Chinaglia passed away in  Florida  due to complications from
a heart attack, the U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame said on its
website. Chinaglia was inducted into the shrine in 2000.  Chinaglia played alongside Pele and  Franz Beckenbauer  for
the Cosmos and became one of the most recognized players in the
North American Soccer League, winning five scoring titles in
seven seasons and helping the Cosmos win NASL championships in
1977, 1978, 1980 and 1982. A striker, Chinaglia was the most
prolific scorer in league history, with 193 goals in 213
regular-season games and another 50 in 43 playoff matches,
according to U.S. Soccer’s official  website .  Chinaglia joined the Cosmos in 1976 after playing for Lazio
in his native  Italy  for six seasons. He helped the Rome-based
club win the Serie A title in 1974 and returned as Lazio’s
president from 1983-85 following his playing career in the U.S.  Chinaglia, who started his soccer career with Swansea City
in 1964-65, also earned 14 caps with the Italian national team
and participated in the 1974  World Cup . Chinaglia had been co-
hosting “The Football Show” on Sirius XM radio since 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
