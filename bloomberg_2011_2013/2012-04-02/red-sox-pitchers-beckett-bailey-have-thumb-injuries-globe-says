Boston Red Sox pitchers  Josh Beckett 
and  Andrew Bailey  are dealing with thumb injuries as the Major
League Baseball season gets fully under way this week, according
to the Boston Globe.  With the Red Sox opening their season April 5 at the
Detroit Tigers, manager  Bobby Valentine  said that he “totally”
expects Beckett to make his scheduled start April 7 after
traveling to San Antonio today to have his thumb examined,  the
newspaper said .  Beckett, 31, didn’t miss a start this spring. His injury
was disclosed to reporters by pitcher Alfredo Aceves, who was
told by Valentine to be ready in case Beckett isn’t available,
the Globe said.  Beckett has a “little situation that he’s getting taken
care of today just for peace of mind,” Valentine said,
according to the Globe.  A three-time All-Star, Beckett went 13-7 with a 2.89 earned
run average last season.  Bailey, a closer who was acquired from Oakland in December,
will be examined for a thumb injury in  Boston  today and may
start the season on the disabled list, the Globe said.  The team declined to discuss the specifics of the injury,
according to the newspaper. Because Bailey last pitched March
26, he would be eligible to return from the 15-day disabled list
on April 10, missing four regular-season games.  The 27-year-old Bailey was named an All-Star for the
 Oakland Athletics  in 2009 and 2010. He had 24 saves and a 3.24
ERA last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
