Gilts declined, extending two months
of losses, as U.K. reports showing gains in manufacturing and
house prices damped demand for the safety of the nation’s
government debt.  Thirty-year  bonds  dropped for a second day after a gauge of
Chinese manufacturing advanced to a one-year high, adding to
signs the global economy is gaining momentum. Euro-area finance
ministers last week agreed to provide 500 billion euros ($665
billion) in bailout funds to combat the region’s debt crisis.
The pound rose to a four-month high against the dollar.  “The data we have here today and out of  China , plus the
news on European bailout funds bode well for risk assets,” said
Vatsala Datta, an interest-rate strategist at Lloyds Banking
Group Plc in London. “Yields in core bond markets may have
further to rise in the near-term.”  The yield on the  10-year gilt  climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.22 percent at 4:07 p.m.  London  time
after increasing 23 basis points during February and March. The
4 percent bond due March 2022 dropped 0.150, or 1.50 pounds per
1,000-pound ($1,603) face amount, to 115.790. Thirty-year yields
rose one basis point to 3.38 percent.  Ten-year yields will increase to 2.55 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of financial companies with
the most recent projections given the heaviest weightings.  House Prices  U.K. house prices increased in March for the first time in
21 months as buyers rushed to beat the expiration of a property-
tax exemption and prices in London gained, Hometrack Ltd. said.  A gauge of British factory output, based on a survey by
 Markit Economics  and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply , rose to 52.1 in March from a revised 51.5 in February.
The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for
a decline to 50.7 from an initially reported 51.2. A reading
above 50 indicates expansion.  Gilts have lost 1.8 percent this year, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. U.S. Treasuries dropped 1.3 percent, and
German bonds rose 0.3 percent.  The pound appreciated 0.1 percent to $1.6018 after rising
to $1.6063, the highest since Nov. 14. The U.K. currency gained
0.2 percent to 83.08 pence per euro.  European Unemployment  Sterling climbed for a third day against the euro after a
European report showed unemployment increased to a 14-year high
in February, sapping demand for the single currency.  The jobless rate in the euro region rose to 10.8 percent
from 10.7 percent in January, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said. That’s the highest since June 1997,
before the euro was introduced.  The pound has strengthened 0.4 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The euro is little changed, and the
dollar declined 2.9 percent.  Futures traders trimmed bets that sterling will weaken
versus the dollar. The difference in the number of wagers by
 hedge funds  and other large speculators on a decline in the
pound compared with those on a gain was 11,110 on March 27,
compared with 15,852 a week earlier, according to figures from
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The pound may be heading toward the Oct. 31 high of $1.6167
after it rose to the highest level in six months, with the
currency staying above its 200-day moving average of $1.5851,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
