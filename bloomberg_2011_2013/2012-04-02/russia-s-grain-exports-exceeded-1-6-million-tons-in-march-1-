Russia  exported more than 1.6
million metric tons of  grain  in March and shipments may reach a
record this season, said Arkady Zlochevsky, the country’s Grain
Union president.  Russia’s monthly grain exports for April and May are seen
remaining at the same level as they were in March, Zlochevsky
said in Moscow today. That compares with a record 3.8 million
tons in September, he said. The country’s carry-over stocks may
exceed 20 million tons by July 1.  Total exports are seen at 26 million tons this season and
would be an “absolute record,” he said, adding shipments are
expected to be between 22 million and 25 million tons in the
2012-13 marketing year.  Most of Russia’s supplies go to North Africa,  Middle East 
and  Turkey , Zlochevsky said, adding shipments go to more than 80
countries.  Exports slowed in the second half of the season because of
frozen ports in the Sea of Azov and small stockpiles in Russia’s
south, he said.  The country is losing international tenders to U.S. wheat
because Russia’s free-on-board wheat at the Black Sea port of
Novorossiysk costs about $273 a ton, or $13 more, Zlochevsky
said.  “In the past two months, we have been unable to offer
prices lower than the Americans in  Egypt ,” Zlochevsky said.
Russia will start winning tenders in September when it sells its
new crop, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
