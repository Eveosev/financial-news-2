Klaipedos Nafta AB (KNF1L) , which operates
Lithuania’s oil terminal on the  Baltic Sea , is seeking Azeri gas
supplies for the country’s planned liquefied natural gas
terminal, the Baltic News Service reported today, citing unnamed
people.  Chief Executive Officer Rokas Masiulis is meeting gas and
oil companies in Azerbaijan this week, the newswire said.  Klaipedos Nafta, which is 70.63 percent owned by the state,
plans to begin operations at a floating liquefied-natural-gas
terminal at the end of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
