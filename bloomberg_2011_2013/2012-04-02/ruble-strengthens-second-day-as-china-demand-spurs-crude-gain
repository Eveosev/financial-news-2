The ruble strengthened against the
dollar for a second day as signs the Chinese economy is
improving spurred demand for oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner.  The Russian currency gained 0.3 percent to 29.3397 per
dollar at 10:38 a.m. in Moscow. The ruble appreciated 0.1
percent to 39.185 per euro and 0.3 percent to 33.7605 against
the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Brent crude  rose 0.2 percent to $123.15 per barrel after a
purchasing managers’ index for  China  climbed to a one-year high
in March, signalling demand for commodities may increase in the
world’s second-biggest consumer of crude. Oil and gas together
contribute about 17 percent to Russia’s gross domestic product
and 50 percent of state revenue, according to government
estimates.  Investors pared bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing it at 29.6945 per dollar in three
months, compared with expectations of 29.7825 per dollar on
March 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
