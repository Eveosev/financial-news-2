Kunlun Energy Co. (135) , a Chinese gas
supplier controlled by  PetroChina Co. (857) , is seeking about $1.4
billion in a stock offering to accelerate its liquefied-natural
gas expansion.  A total of 800 million primary shares are being offered at
HK$13 to HK$13.50 each, a discount of as much as 8.3 perent to
its closing price yesterday, according to a term sheet for the
sale obtained by Bloomberg News. At the high end of the range,
the sale would fetch HK$10.8 billion ($1.4 billion).  The share sale comes as Kunlun seeks to become the
country’s biggest onshore LNG supplier and producer within the
next two years. It’s building 15 LNG plants in Chinese provinces
and regions including  Inner Mongolia , Xinjiang and Qinghai,
according to a company filing last month.  Last week, Kunlun posted full-year sales of HK$25.4 billion
and net income of HK$5.61 billion. Profit exceeded the average
 estimate  of HK$4.85 billion from a Bloomberg News survey of
eight analysts.  Kunlun’s Hong Kong-traded shares gained 28 percent  this
year , ourperforming the city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index , which
rose about 11 percent. The stock gained 1.3 percent  yesterday  to
close at HK$14.18, before the news.  To contact the reporter on this story:
