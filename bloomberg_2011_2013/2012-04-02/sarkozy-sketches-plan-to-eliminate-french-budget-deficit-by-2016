French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
plan to eliminate the  budget deficit  by 2016 relies on 75
billion euros ($100 billion) of spending cuts and 40 billion
euros of tax increases, he told three regional newspapers.  In an interview  published today in Le Republicain Lorrain,
L’Est Republicain and Vosges Matin, Sarkozy didn’t give details
on the spending reductions. He may disclose the plans later this
week in  his campaign  platform.  Tax increases worth 32 billion euros were enacted in
October and November and will produce full results starting this
year. The remaining 8 billion euros in new tax revenues will
come from levies Sarkozy has promised to impose, including a tax
on the worldwide revenue of large French companies and a levy on
fiscal exiles.  Asked if electricity prices would increase, he answered
“with nuclear energy, no” and stressed the difference with his
opponent Socialist  Francois Hollande  who pledged to reduce the
share of nuclear power in France energy output.  Hollande plans to reach zero deficits by 2017, a year later
than Sarkozy, and has pledged to collect 20 billion euros of new
taxes by the end of the five-year mandate and eliminate 29
billion euros of tax breaks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
