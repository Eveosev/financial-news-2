PBG SA (PBG) , Poland’s third-largest
construction company, advanced as Rzeczpospolita reported it may
sell property units to help pay down debt.  The shares gained as much as 4.8 percent to 40.9 zloty, the
highest level since March 20 on a closing basis, and traded 2.4
percent stronger at 39.96 zloty as of 11:14 a.m. in Warsaw.  PBG may decide to sell its PBG Dom property unit with real-
estate projects valued at 375 million zloty ($121 million), if
it finds a buyer, the newspaper reported, citing Kinga Banaszak-
Filipiak, a spokeswoman for the company. PBG said on March 27 it
is in talks to sell three units, including a subsidiary of PBG
Dom. Banaszak-Filipiak wasn’t available when contacted by phone
by Bloomberg News today.  “We have to wait for facts to assess whether the company
will manage to sell its property projects given the tough
conditions on the market,” Robert Maj, a Warsaw-based analyst
at KBC Groep NV, said by phone.  The builder needs to raise funds as its net debt surged to
1.46 billion zloty at the end of 2011 from 585 million zloty a
year earlier on payment delays and growing foreign competition
for contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
