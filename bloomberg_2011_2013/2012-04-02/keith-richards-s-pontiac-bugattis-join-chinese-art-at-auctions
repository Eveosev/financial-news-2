A Pontiac convertible formerly owned
by  Keith Richards  may fetch as much as $35,000 as Rolling Stones
fans and car collectors are lured by a U.K. auction.  The dark blue 1950 Chieftain Silver Streak was used by the
guitarist as the band recorded “Exile on Main Street” at his
home in the south of France in the early 1970s.  The car, with an estimate of 18,000 pounds ($28,850) to
22,000 pounds, stars in the Bonhams April 30 auction at the RAF
Museum, Hendon. It is being sold by a U.K. classic car and
Stones enthusiast who acquired it directly from Richards in the
mid-1980s, said the London-based auction house.  The left-hand-drive convertible was originally supplied by
the now-defunct Pontiac marque specifically for the European
market and was Richards’s runaround when he rented Villa
Nellcote, near Villefranche-sur-Mer, in 1971.  Richards acquired it second-hand from a neighbor of the
U.K. novelist Somerset Maugham, said Bonhams.  The band worked on tracks including “Rip This Joint,”
“Happy” and “Shake Your Hips” in the basement of Nellcote.
Beat novelist William S. Burroughs was among the visitors.  Denmark Bugattis  Two 1930s Bugattis will be included in an auction of more
than 175 autos from a classic-car museum in  Denmark  in August.  Offered without reserves, the cars from the Aalholm
Automobil Museum will be sold by  R.M. Auctions  on Aug. 12. The
event, featuring mostly vintage and prewar models, will be held
in the grounds of Aalholm Castle, a fortress overlooking the
harbor of Nysted.  The event has a total estimate of about 4 million euros
($5.3 million), the Canadian-based auction house said.  “It’s the first time we’ve offered a museum collection in
 Europe ,” RM’s German-based specialist Annette Abaci said in an
interview. “We’re normally associated with Ferraris and this
sale will be a chance to develop our market in Scandinavia.”  The museum was founded by auto enthusiast Baron J.O. Raben-
Levetzau in 1964 using the castle’s own 1911 Rolls-Royce Silver
Ghost “Roi des Belges” tourer as the starting point, RM said.  The Rolls-Royce will be included in the auction with an
estimate of 220,000 euros to 300,000 euros. The Aalholm Castle
estate was sold to Stig Husted Andersen in 1995 and the museum
closed in 2007 following Andersen’s death, said dealers.  A 1938 Bugatti 57C Stelvio Drophead Coupe by Gangloff has
been in the collection since 1965. It will be valued at 240,000
euros to 280,000 euros. A 1931 Bugatti Type 40A Tourer, one of
32 built, will be priced at 50,000 euros to 70,000 euros.  Many of the Aalholm museum’s more valuable cars were sold
by Sotheby’s in October 1994. That earlier auction, which also
included autos from other sellers, raised 865,778 pounds with a
top price of 83,172 pounds for a blue 1929 Mercedes-Benz 630K
tourer.  Chinese Sales  Two Chinese artifacts re-offered at auctions in  France 
after their bills failed to be paid have found new buyers -- at
far lower prices.  The Toulouse auctioneer  Chassaing-Marambat  sold an 18th-
century white jade seal associated with the Qianlong Emperor for
3.8 million euros with fees on March 31. A year earlier, it had
been bid to 12.4 million euros by an unidentified Chinese client
who paid only 2.2 million euros of the auction price.  “They’ve lost their deposit and we’re about to take legal
action against them for the difference in price,” said Paris-
based Asian-art specialist Pierre Ansas, who cataloged the
piece. “That bidder was based in Hong Kong. It’s a former
British colony, so we can sue them there, unlike bidders on the
Chinese mainland.”  Non-Payment  Slow and non-payment is a continuing issue with some Asian
bidders at auctions of Chinese works of art.  Sotheby’s (BID)  sales that were canceled on 19 lots between 2008
and 2011 amounted to about $22 million, according to court
papers. The New York-based auctioneer started lawsuits in Hong
Kong, naming successful bidders for the first time. Most of the
claims have now been settled, said Diana Phillips, a
spokeswoman.  The new buyer of the Toulouse seal was a telephone bidder
who’d been required to pay a deposit of 3 million euros in order
to compete for the piece, Ansas said.  The day before,  Olivier Doutrebente  in Paris re-offered an
Imperial 35-sheet album of 18th-century Buddhist texts that had
been bid to 3.6 million euros by another non-paying Chinese
client a year ago.  This time around, it sold for 2 million euros to a Chinese
bidder on a telephone in  Hong Kong , said Severine Berti-Wang,
who handles media enquiries for Doutrebente and other auction
houses in the French capital.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
