TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL) , the world’s
largest electrical-connections maker, won European Union
approval to buy Deutsch Group SAS from  Wendel SA (MF)  for about $2.1
billion to expand its presence in the defense and oil-and-gas
industries.  The companies “are not each other’s closest competitors as
they operate on different ends of the product spectrum,” the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today. “The
transaction would not significantly impede competition.”  TE emerged when  Tyco International Ltd. (TYC)  split into three
companies in 2007. The provider of wires, switches and sensors
will finance the deal with cash and debt, it said last year.
Deutsch, which has corporate offices in  New York , provides
connectors for harsh environments in the aerospace, defense and
offshore vehicle industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
