Sigdo Koppers SA (SK)  rose the most in
eight weeks after the Chilean industrial holding company moved
to enter the Brazilian market through an acquisition.  Sigdo Koppers gained 2.8 percent to 1,157 pesos at the
close in Santiago, the steepest increase since Feb. 8.  Enaex SA (ENAEX) , an explosives producer majority owned by Sigdo
Koppers, and  Peru ’s Brescia Group said March 30 that they had
agreed to pay 219.2 million reais ($120 million) for a two-
thirds stake in IBQ Industrias Quimicas SA, a Brazilian
explosives manufacturer.  “We see this transaction as a net positive for Enaex, both
for the compelling valuation agreed and for the potential
synergies that could have positive impacts beyond the growth of
the acquired target itself,” Alex Sadzawka, an analyst at
Celfin Capital SA, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  The deal, in which current controller CR Almeida retains a
one-third stake, values IBQ’s equity at $180 million, Sadzawka
said in the research note. The price is consistent with a
valuation of 12 times earnings, he said.  The median ratio in acquisitions of Brazilian companies
announced or completed in the past year is 19 times net income,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sigdo Koppers has spent $836 million on acquisitions in the
past year, mostly of providers of machinery and services to the
 mining industry , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
