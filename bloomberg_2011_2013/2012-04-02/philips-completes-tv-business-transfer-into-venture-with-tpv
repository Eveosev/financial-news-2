Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIL) 
completed the transfer of its unprofitable television business
into a joint venture with  TPV Technology Ltd. (903) , offloading a
business that weighed on earnings for years.  The business will be 70 percent owned by Hong Kong-based
TPV and 30 percent by Philips, be called TP Vision, and will be
headquartered in Amsterdam, according the companies. Maarten de Vries, who will lead the venture, aims to make TP Vision one of
the “top three player in the markets we play in,” he said on a
call with journalists today.  “The TV industry is changing, and we came to conclusion
that we need to team up with a partner,” Philips Chief
Executive Officer Frans van Houten said on the call. “The joint
venture does not mean the end of Philips TVs, but a great
future.”  Philips, based in Amsterdam, booked a 272 million-euro
charge ($363 million) in the fourth quarter as part of the
separation from the television business. Philips already moved
its monitor business into a partnership with TPV, a
collaboration that became profitable after two years, and De
Vries said today he aims to repeat that success with the
television partnership, declining to give a timeline.  Van Houten , who has been in charge of Philips for a year,
said there have been “no material changes” to the deal results
since the November announcement of the partnership.  Philips gained 6 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 15.26 euros as
of 9:25 a.m. local time, valuing the company at 15.4 billion
euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
