The Australian dollar gained against
most of its major counterparts before a  Reserve Bank  of
 Australia  meeting where policy makers are forecast to keep the
developed-world’s highest interest rates unchanged.  The Aussie had its biggest intraday advance against the
dollar yesterday in more than two months after U.S.
 manufacturing  expanded more than projected in March. New
Zealand’s dollar rose against the greenback as stocks and
commodities climbed.  The Australian dollar opened today at $1.0418 after
climbing 0.7 percent yesterday to $1.0419. It rose as much as
1.2 percent yesterday, the most since Jan. 25. New Zealand’s
dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, was at 82.33 U.S. cents today after
adding 0.6 percent yesterday to 82.34 U.S. cents.  The MSCI World Index of stocks gained 0.9 percent
yesterday, and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI  Index (MXWO)  of 24 raw
materials  advanced  1.7 percent.  The  Reserve Bank of Australia , which reduced its benchmark
 interest rate  in November and December, is forecast in a
Bloomberg poll to leave its benchmark  interest rate  at 4.25
percent today. Traders expect a cut of 74 basis points, or 0.74
percentage point, over the coming 12 months, according to a
Credit Suisse Group AG  index  based on overnight index swap
rates.  The Institute for Supply Management’s U.S. factory gauge
rose to 53.4 last month, from 52.4 in February. Economists
forecast an increase to 53. Fifty is the dividing line between
growth and contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
