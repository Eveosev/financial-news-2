Fisker Automotive Inc., a maker of
plug-in hybrid  sports cars , got financing that increases its
funding to $1.025 billion.  The company disclosed the $129 million investment in a
filing today that didn’t identify investors. It said in February
it had received $263 million as part of the same financing round
and at the time had $896 million in total private funding.  Fisker, based in Anaheim,  California , is working to fix a
defect in its Karma sedan as it seeks to resume work on a
stalled plant in Delaware, where it is using $529 million in
government loans to build a second model. The company is backed
by investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Palo
Alto Investors LLC and the lithium-ion battery maker  A123
Systems Inc. (AONE)   A123 said March 26 it was replacing defective batteries
that caused a Karma to shut down in a Consumer Reports test. The
U.S. Energy Department in February froze Fisker’s access to the
loans, causing the company to “temporarily” stop work on a
plant in Delaware.  To contact the reporter on this story:
