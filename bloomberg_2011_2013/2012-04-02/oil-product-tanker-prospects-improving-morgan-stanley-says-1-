Prospects for tankers hauling
refined oil products such as gasoline are improving “rapidly”
and charter rates for the vessels may increase, according to
Morgan Stanley.  Higher refinery utilization rates and stronger exports of
refined products from the U.S. Gulf Coast bolstered demand for
tankers, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Fotis Giannakoulis in
 New York  said in a report sent by e-mail today.  Demand for product cargoes may advance, sending rates
“significantly higher” for single voyages, as new refineries
replace lost capacity and more plants carry out maintenance,
Morgan Stanley said. Charterers aim to hire vessels before a
possible rebound in freight costs as gauged by so-called ton-
mile demand, the report showed.  “During the last two months, the number of period charters
has doubled compared to the previous seven months,” Morgan
Stanley said in the report. Ton-mile demand is calculated by
multiplying cargo size and distance traveled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
