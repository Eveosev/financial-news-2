South Sudanese President  Salva Kiir 
urged U.S. President  Barack Obama  to pressure Sudan to cease
border attacks and return to peace talks, Deputy Information
Minister Atem Yaak Atem said.  Kiir spoke to Obama by telephone today for 45 minutes,
according to Atem, who said he was present during the
conversation. The two presidents discussed clashes along the
border with Sudan after fighting broke out between the two
countries’ armies on March 26.  “President Kiir asked President Obama to apply pressure on
the government of Sudan to resolve the conflict through
dialogue,” Atem said by phone today from South Sudan’s capital,
Juba.  Sudan’s president, Umar al-Bashir, cancelled a meeting with
Kiir that was due to take place tomorrow in Juba. Atem said that
Kiir told Obama he would be willing to meet al-Bashir at a
location and date of the Sudanese president’s choosing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
