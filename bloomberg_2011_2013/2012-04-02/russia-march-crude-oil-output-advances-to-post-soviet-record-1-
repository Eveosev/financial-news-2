Russian crude oil and gas condensate
production climbed 1.6 percent in March from a year earlier to
10.36 million barrels a day, marking a post-Soviet  record .  Production rose 0.2 percent from February, according to
preliminary data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. The
previous high was 10.35 million barrels a day in October last
year. Soviet-era output in Russia peaked at 11.48 million
barrels a day in 1987, according to data compiled by  BP Plc. (BP/)   President-elect  Vladimir Putin  has called for Russian
producers to maintain output at more than 10 million barrels a
day for at least the next decade and lowered the  tax rate  on
crude exports last year to spur production.  “We see output at its peak, maintained by drilling,” said
 Valery Nesterov , an oil analyst at Troika Dialog in Moscow.
“But it will not last for long. The situation will remain
stable for another two to three years and then output will start
declining.”  Oil  exports  fell to 5.25 million barrels a day, down 0.3
percent from February and 6.1 percent from a year earlier.  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , the state-controlled natural-gas producer and
exporter, boosted oil output 14 percent from a year earlier to
314,800 barrels a day, maintained a lead over OAO Bashneft, the
regional producer controlled by billionaire Vladimir
Evtushenkov’s AFK Sistema.  OAO Lukoil (LKOH) ,  Russia ’s second-biggest oil company, was the
only one of the nine biggest producers to have an annual decline
in March, with output of 1.69 million barrels a day. That was a
decrease of 2.4 percent from a year earlier, while a gain of 0.1
percent from the previous month.  Russian natural-gas production rose 0.9 percent from a year
earlier to 2.01 billion cubic meters a day. Output at OAO
Gazprom, Russia’s export monopoly, fell 1.4 percent to 1.52
billion cubic meters a day in March against the same period the
previous year, and 3.6 percent from February, when a cold snap
boosted demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
