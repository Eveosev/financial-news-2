Peru ’s sol held near a 15-year high
as companies bought the currency to pay income taxes and the
central bank purchased dollars to curb gains.  The sol was unchanged at 2.6680 per  U.S. dollar  at today’s
close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The currency
earlier touched 2.6670, the strongest level since 1997,  data 
from Peru’s financial regulator show.  The country’s central bank bought $75 million in the spot
market today after companies sold dollars before an April 10
deadline for annual tax payments. The central bank paid 2.6678
soles per dollar, it said in a statement on its website.  Demand for soles will ease this month as companies “have
already bought most of the soles they need” to pay taxes, said
 Mario Guerrero , an economist at Scotiabank Peru in  Lima .  Peruvian consumer prices rose in March at the fastest pace
in eight months on increases in the cost of food, fuel and
schooling, the national statistics agency said yesterday. The
monthly inflation rate accelerated to 0.77 percent from 0.32
percent in February.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.47 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The security’s price fell 0.09 centimo to 115.66
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
