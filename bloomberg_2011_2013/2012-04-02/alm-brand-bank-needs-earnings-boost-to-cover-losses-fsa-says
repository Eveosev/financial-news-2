Alm. Brand (ALMB)  Bank, the lending arm of
Danish insurer  Alm. Brand (ALMB)  A/S, needs to increase its earnings to
cover potential losses and take more write-offs,  Denmark ’s
financial regulator said.  The bank must write down 190 million kroner ($34 million)
of mostly agricultural loans after a review of 599 loans,
including the 65 largest, the Copenhagen-based Financial
Supervisory Authority  said  today in a statement on its website.  “The bank’s business model is challenged by the fact that
the bank’s budgeted core earnings are very low and therefore can
absorb future losses to only a limited extent,” the agency
said. The bank is in the process of unwinding 7 billion kroner
in loans, or 68 percent of its total book, the FSA said.  The agency cited  Alm. Brand Bank (ALMB)  for appointing a board
member who also serves on the board of one of its customer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
