Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.16 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.12 percent on March 30 after trading
from 0.03 percent to 0.15 percent and averaging 0.07 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank plans to purchase $4.25 billion to $5
billion of securities maturing from May 2020 to February 2022
today, according to the New York Fed’s website.  The purchases are part of the Fed’s program to replace $400
billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term
Treasuries in an effort to reduce borrowing costs further and
counter rising risks of a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
