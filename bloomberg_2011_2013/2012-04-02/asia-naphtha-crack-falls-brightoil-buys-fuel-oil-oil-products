The Asian naphtha crack fell to the
lowest in a week. Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. bought fuel-
oil in  Singapore , the region’s biggest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
dropped to $118.78 a metric ton at 5:24 p.m. Singapore time from
$126.97 a ton on March 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread, a measure of the profit from
making the gasoline and petrochemical feedstock, narrowed 8.2
percent last month, the biggest decline since October.  Glencore International Plc sold 25,000 tons of open-
specification naphtha for delivery in the second half of May to
Marubeni Corp. at $1,057 a ton, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of traders who monitored transactions on the Platts
window.  BP Plc sold 50,000 barrels of  92-RON (MOGFC92S)  gasoline for loading
April 17 to April 21 to PetroChina Co. at $134.90 a barrel, the
survey showed. BP also sold 50,000 barrels of the same grade to
Trafigura Beheer BV at $134.50 a barrel.  Trafigura also bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON from Total
SA at $135 a barrel.  Fuel Oil  Brightoil purchased two 20,000-ton shipments of  380-
centistoke (N6SHS380)  fuel oil for loading from April 18 to April 22,
according to the Bloomberg survey. PetroChina and China
International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., or Unipec, each
received $2.50 a ton over benchmark quotes.  Chevron Corp. sold a similar cargo to Hin Leong Trading Pte
at a premium of $2.25 a ton to April prices for April 17 to
April 21 loading, the survey showed.  Fuel oil ’s discount to Asian marker Dubai crude narrowed
$1.02, or 15 percent, to $5.65 a barrel at 2 p.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The  discount 
shrank the most since March 16, signaling reduced losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of  180-centistoke (N6SHS180)  fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged after dropping to
$11.50 a ton, PVM said. This means bunker, or marine fuel, moved
in tandem with higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  The premium of  gasoil , or diesel, to Dubai crude rose 62
cents to $16.12 a barrel at 2 p.m. Singapore time, according to
PVM. The difference, also known as the  crack spread , widened the
most since Feb. 15.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil climbed 20 cents to 45 cents a
barrel, PVM said. That’s the highest  regrade  in four weeks,
indicating it is more profitable to make  aviation fuel .  Refinery News  Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s Japanese unit idled its Nishihara
refinery in Okinawa for maintenance until April 28, Kimi Helena Higa, a Nansei Sekiyu K.K. spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. shut a 65,000 barrel-a-day crude
distillation unit for maintenance today at the Mizue plant of
its Keihin refinery near  Tokyo , spokesman Satoshi Yoshida said
by phone. The company plans to start the unit in mid-May.  Tenders  Indian Oil Corp. offered to sell as much as 70,000 tons of
naphtha for April loading, said two traders who declined to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media.  Saigon Petroleum Co. and Thanh Le General Import Export
Trading Corp., or Thalexim, sought to buy 15,000 tons of gasoil
for May delivery, according to a joint document e-mailed to
potential suppliers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
