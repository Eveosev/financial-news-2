The European Banking Federation,
which represents lenders in the region, started a gauge of
dollar funding costs in the  interbank market .  A total  20 lenders  will contribute lending costs to fix a
dollar Euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, according to the
Brussels-based EBF. The measure was developed in response to
demand from European banks, the organization said in a March 30
 statement .  Dollar Euribor will compete with the London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, the benchmark for $360 trillion of
securities worldwide that is managed by the British Bankers’
Association in London. Regulators around the globe are probing
whether banks colluded to manipulate rates including Libor.  “Market actors have been calling for such a fixing for the
last three years,” Guido Ravoet, the Euribor-EBF’s chief
executive officer said in the statement. “We are pleased to be
able to deliver this new instrument which will contribute to
measuring the dollar funding cost in the interbank market, using
our experience in managing interbank benchmarks.”  Three-month dollar Euribor was fixed at  0.957 percent 
today, more than double dollar Libor at 0.468 percent. The rate
that London-based banks say they pay for three-month loans in
dollars has fallen from 0.581 percent at the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
