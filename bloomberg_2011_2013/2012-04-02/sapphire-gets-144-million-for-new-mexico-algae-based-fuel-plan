Sapphire Energy Inc., which produces
crude oil from algae, received $144 million from investors to
build a demonstration plant in  New Mexico .  The plant in Luna County has received a $50 million grant
from the U.S. Energy Department and a $54.4 million loan
guarantee from the U.S. Agriculture Department, closely held
Sapphire said today in a statement.  Sapphire grows oil-containing algae that’s refined into
diesel and jet fuel. The demonstration plant will be able to
produce as much as 100 barrels of algae-derived crude a day by
the end of 2014, according to Beth Llewelyn, a Sapphire
spokeswoman.  Participants in the San Diego-based company’s Series C
financing round include the private equity company Arrowpoint
Partners and  Monsanto Co. (MON) , which agreed in March 2011 to back
Sapphire as part of an effort to identify genes that stimulate
algae growth.  Investors in the company’s Series B financing round joined
the new funding, Sapphire said, including Arch Venture Partners
LP,  Bill Gates ’ Cascade Investment LLC, the London-based charity
Wellcome Trust Ltd. and Venrock Associates, the venture capital
company of the Rockefeller family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
