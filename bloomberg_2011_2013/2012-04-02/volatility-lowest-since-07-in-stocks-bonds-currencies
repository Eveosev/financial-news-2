Markets for equities, bonds and
currencies are the calmest they’ve been since 2007, and that’s
making some investors nervous.  Options that protect against Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
losses plunged 64 percent in the last two quarters, the most
ever, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Interest-rate  volatility 
is near a five-year low, while demand for hedges against extreme
moves in the dollar is close to the weakest since 2008. Bank of
America Corp.’s Market Risk cross-asset volatility  index  reached
a level not seen since November 2007.  Becalmed markets have fooled investors before. The Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index fell to a 13-year low of
9.89 in January 2007 before the financial crisis of 2008 wiped
$37 trillion from share prices worldwide. As the gauge of
options prices slipped within 5 points of that level last week
following a 28 percent  S&P 500  rally, demand has risen fivefold
for exchange-traded products whose value increases should
volatility rebound.  “Nobody is scared right now, but the fear will come
back,” Sean Heron, who manages options strategies at Glenmede
Trust Co., said in a March 30 phone interview. The Philadelphia-
based firm oversees about $20 billion. “All bets are off as
soon as we get beyond the next three months.  Europe  could rear
its ugly head again and it’s an election year in the U.S.”  Financial Stress  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s indicator of cross-asset
volatility, a component of their Global Financial Stress Index,
fell to minus 0.41 on March 29, down from a positive reading of
0.28 at the beginning of the year. It touched minus 0.48 on
March 2, its lowest level since November 2007, just before the
 U.S. economy  was about to enter an 18-month recession and a
month after the S&P 500 reached a record high.  The index is a measure of future price swings implied by
option markets in global equities,  interest rates , currencies
and commodities. A negative number means lower-than-normal
volatility expectations based on data going back to 2000.  “The rally in risk assets combined with the liquidity
support provided to the market by central banks have acted to
depress volatility,” Benjamin Bowler, San Francisco-based head
of global equity derivatives research at Bank of America Corp.,
said in a March 29 phone interview. “If the recent strength of
the U.S. economy begins to fade and markets roll over, then I
would expect to see a rise in volatility.”  The VIX averaged 18.04 from January through April 2011,
falling to 14.62 on April 28, a day before the S&P 500 peaked
and began a 19 percent decline that lasted until Oct. 3. The S&P
500 moved 1.3 percent a day from April through December,
compared with a 50-year average of 0.6 percent before the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.  Liquidity Injections  Investors have been appeased so far in 2012 as central
banks from Europe to the U.S. and  Asia  try to speed the recovery
from the first global recession since World War II. The Federal
Reserve pledged to keep rates near zero through at least late
2014, while the  European Central Bank  gave banks more than $1
trillion of three-year loans. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  unexpectedly
added 10 trillion yen ($120 billion) to an asset-purchase
program in February.  Improvements in U.S. payrolls and consumer confidence
pushed the S&P 500 to its biggest first-quarter rally since
1998. It  advanced  12 percent in 2012 to 1,408.47 on March 30.
The VIX slid a record 66 percent since its Oct. 3 high to 15.5
on March 30, below its 22-year historical average of 20.54. The
gauge, which touched its lowest level since June 2007 on March
26, gained 0.9 percent to 15.64 in  New York  today. Europe’s
VStoxx Index fell 5.9 percent to 21.22 today.  VIX’s Average  “The current equity volatility environment is supremely
challenging,” Jeremy Wien, head of VIX trading at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in New York, wrote in a March 30 e-mail. “Do we buy
volatility at low levels relative to the last few years because
of the headline risks, or do we sell volatility because the
market is hardly moving?”  Investors have piled into exchange-traded products, or
ETPs, betting the volatility decline won’t last. The number of
shares outstanding for 17 of these products that increase when
the VIX rises has jumped more than fivefold this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares (VXXSO)  of the Barclays Plc’s  IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term
Futures ETN (VXX) , the largest ETP that climbs when the VIX increases,
jumped fivefold this year to a record 114.3 million on March 23,
boosting its market value to as much as $2.18 billion on March
19. The price of the note is down 53 percent this year.  TVIX  Demand for Credit Suisse Group AG’s  VelocityShares Daily 2x
VIX Short Term ETN (TVIX) , known by its ticker symbol  TVIX (TVIXSO) , pushed
shares outstanding to 54.2 million, up almost 11-fold since the
end of last year. The Zurich-based bank on Feb. 21 stopped
issuing shares “due to internal limits on the size of the
ETNs,” according to a statement at the time. The market
capitalization of the note reached almost $700 million on March
6. The TVIX, which lost 77 percent this year, aims to generate
twice the daily return of an index tracking VIX futures.  Swings (USGG10YR)  in Treasury yields have been subdued as the Fed’s
pledge to keep borrowing costs low anchored short-term rates and
concern about European sovereign-debt crisis made investors
reluctant to sell  U.S. debt . The  10-year Treasury (USGG10YR)  yield moved
between 1.79 percent and 2.16 percent in the four-month period
ended Feb. 28.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE Index (MOVE) , which measures
volatility based on prices of over-the-counter options on
Treasuries maturing in two to 30 years,  fell to  69.9 basis
points on March 12, the lowest since July 2007. The index ended
last week at 78.6 basis points.  Quantitative Easing  “The potential for more quantitative easing has grown over
the last week,” Brian Svendahl, Minneapolis-based senior
portfolio manager of fixed income at RBC Global Asset Management
Inc., said in an interview on March 29. His firm oversees more
than $250 billion in assets. “We are likely a few data points
away -- or even a European explosion away -- from more monetary
accommodation.”  Wall Street’s largest bond trading firms think the worst is
likely over for the Treasury market as the pace of economic
activity wanes amid U.S. budget cuts and $100-a-barrel oil.
After reaching as  high as  2.4 percent, the 10-year Treasury note
yield ended the quarter at 2.21 percent. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year note will finish 2012 at 2.48 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
the 21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve .  Stability in global interest rates helped damp swings in
exchange rates over the quarter. A simultaneous fall in options
prices and demand for hedges suggests currency derivatives
investors may also be underestimating the risk of broad swings
in foreign-exchange, according to Caio Natividade of Deutsche
Bank AG.  Extreme Currency Moves  A gauge of the demand for hedges against extreme currency
moves in the dollar against the euro, known as the option
butterfly, is near a low touched in March 2011, which was the
lowest since September 2008, before the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.  Implied volatility  of options that
protect against fluctuations in developed nations’ currencies is
10.04 percent, just above 9.71 percent touched in February, the
lowest since August 2008, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co.
index.  “There clearly seems to be some underestimation of risk in
the markets,” Natividade, the London-based head of foreign-
exchange quantitative strategy for Deutsche Bank, said in a
March 29 interview. “People may think we are in a new paradigm
of low volatility, but that is not what we expect,” said
Natividade, whose firm is the world’s largest currency trader,
according to Euromoney Institutional Investor.  Euro’s Quarterly Gain  The euro had its biggest quarterly gain in a year against
the dollar during the January to March period, after European
finance ministers agreed to boost an anti-debt-crisis firewall,
adding confidence the region’s financial problems are abating.  The euro ended the quarter at $1.3343, up 2.95 percent from
$1.2961 at the end of December. The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which
Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses to track the greenback
against the currencies of six U.S. trading partners, fell 1.5
percent during the quarter to 79.004.  Global central banks’ steps to boost liquidity have reduced
the odds of a large shock to the market such as the one that
followed Lehman’s bankruptcy, said Nelson Saiers, who oversees
about $650 million as chief investment officer at Alphabet
Management LLC in New York.  “The markets have a tremendous buffer,” Saiers, who uses
options to bet on the volatility of global stocks, commodities
and currencies, said in a March 29 phone interview.
“Governments have been exceedingly willing to do what they can
to prevent a crisis.”  U.S. Payrolls  U.S. employers boosted payrolls more than forecast last
month, capping the best six-month streak since 2006. Confidence
among consumers unexpectedly rose in March for a seventh
straight month, climbing to a one-year high, the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan’s final index showed on March 30.  Traders are betting volatility will jump from its almost
five-year low.  Ownership (VIX)  of VIX calls rose to a record 4.22
million on March 20, while put open interest was 3.06 million,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. VIX  futures  expiring in six
months on March 16 traded at a record high versus the index, and
the contracts on the measure touched an open interest of 355,393
on March 20, the most ever, the data show.  “You must try to gauge what the likely catalysts for a sea
change are,”  Daragh Maher , a currency strategist at HSBC Bank
Plc in  London , said in a phone interview on March 29. It’s
“entirely conceivable that Europe throws out some other kind of
banana skin that gets markets all energized again.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
