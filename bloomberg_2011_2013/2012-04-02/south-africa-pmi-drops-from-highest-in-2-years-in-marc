South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
 index  fell from the highest level in two years in March as a
decline in sales orders curbed the outlook for manufacturing,
Kagiso Tiso Holdings said.  The seasonally adjusted index fell to 55.1 from 57.9 in
February, Johannesburg-based  Kagiso  said in an e-mailed
statement today. An index level above 50 indicates an expansion
in factory output.  “Although remaining at a favorable level, the forward-
looking indicators of the PMI also pointed to a somewhat less
optimistic outlook,” Hugo Pienaar, senior economist at the
Bureau of  Economic Research , which conducts the survey on behalf
of Kagiso, said in the statement.  Factory output, which accounts for about 15 percent of the
economy, is struggling to recover as a probable recession in
Europe crimps export demand from a region that buys about a
third of South African manufactured goods. That’s undermining
growth in  Africa ’s biggest economy, which the government
forecasts will expand 2.7 percent this year compared with 3.1
percent in 2011.  The median estimate of four economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for the purchasing managers’ index to reach 55.6
in March.  Manufacturing (SFPMNSAY)  expanded 2.4 percent in January  the
statistics office said on March 8. That was lower than a median
estimate of 2.6 in a Bloomberg survey,  New Sales Orders  The index measuring new sales orders fell 5.1 points to
59.7 last month and the business activity sub-index dropped 7.4
points to 57.8, Kagiso said. The price sub-index fell 2.8 points
to 72.9, indicating that “manufacturers’ input costs may have
peaked,” the financial services company said.  The Bureau for Economic Research, based at the University
of Stellenbosch near  Cape Town , and the Institute of Purchasing
and Supply South Africa conduct the PMI survey on behalf of
Kagiso.  The rand rose 0.3 percent to 7.6514 per dollar at 1:05 p.m.
in Johannesburg. The yield on the benchmark rand debt due in
2015 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.69
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
