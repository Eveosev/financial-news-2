Kazakhstan ’s wheat exports may be 13
million metric tons in the season starting July 1, according to
the country’s Grain Union Chairman Nurlan Tleubayev.  Wheat exports will also reach the same amount in the
current season, including 4 million tons of flour calculated in
grain equivalent, Tleubayev said today at a video conference
from Astana. Barley exports may be 600,000 tons this season, he
said.  Kazakhstan, which plans to sow 16.3 million hectares (40.3
million acres) with grains, expects to get a “medium” grain
harvest of 15 million tons in the next season, Anna Buts,
director of the farming department at Kazakhstan’s agriculture
ministry, said at the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
