Dell Inc. (DELL) , the world’s third-largest
maker of personal computers, paid about $1 billion to buy
closely held Wyse Technology Inc., according to a person with
knowledge of the matter.  Purchasing Wyse, which makes desktop devices for cloud
computing, will boost earnings in the second half of fiscal
2013, Dell said today in a statement, which didn’t disclose
terms of the deal. David Frink, a spokesman for Round Rock,
Texas-based Dell, declined to comment, as did Wyse’s Tim Smith.  Wyse sells so-called thin drives, which connect personal
computers to remote servers storing corporate data, as well as
security software and services. The  San Jose , California-based
company has shipped more than 20 million devices worldwide,
according to the statement today.  “A deal for Wyse makes strategic sense for Dell as a way
to leverage its massive installed base of PCs,”  Brian Marshall ,
an analyst with ISI Group in  San Francisco , said in a note to
investors. He has a neutral rating on the shares.  Dell has been using acquisitions to diversify its
operations and sell more equipment and software for corporate
data centers. Meanwhile, it’s cutting back on its less
profitable line of consumer products. The company hired CA Inc.
Chief Executive Officer John Swainson to oversee the push in
February.  Dell was advised by Dewey LeBoeuf LLP, while Wyse received
legal guidance from  Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP .  Dell’s shares rose 1.1 percent to $16.77 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 17 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
