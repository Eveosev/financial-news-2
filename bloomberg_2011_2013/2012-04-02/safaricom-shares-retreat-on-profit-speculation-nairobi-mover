Safaricom Ltd., (SAFCOM)   Kenya ’s biggest
mobile-phone operator, fell the most in a week on speculation
full-year earnings may not increase.  The stock slipped 1.6 percent to 3.15 shillings at 12:40
p.m. in Nairobi, the biggest intraday drop since March 26.  “Their year has just ended and there is a sense that they
recovered from first-half performance, which was quite weak, but
it might not be sufficient for them to post an increase in
profitability,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd. said in a phone interview today.  Profit for the six months through September fell 47 percent
to 4.01 billion shillings ($48.2 million) as costs increased and
after the company re-valued its foreign debt following the
Kenyan shilling’s plunge against the dollar, Safaricom said Nov.
