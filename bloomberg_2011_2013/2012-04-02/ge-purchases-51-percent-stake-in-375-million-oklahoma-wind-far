General Electric Co. (GE) , the largest
U.S. turbine maker, agreed to pay about $191 million for 51
percent of a wind farm under construction in northern Oklahoma
that will cost about $375 million.  The 235-megawatt Chisholm View project is about 85 miles
(137 kilometers) north of  Oklahoma City  and will use 140 of GE’s
1.6-megawatt turbines, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company
said today in a statement.  The project will sell power to Southern Co.’s Alabama Power
utility under a 20-year agreement.  Enel SpA (ENEL) ’s North American
unit will own the remaining 49 percent.  Chisholm View is expected to be completed by the end of the
year and will be eligible for the  production tax credit , which
provides 2.2 cents a kilowatt-hour for power produced by wind.
The credit will expire Dec. 31.  GE Energy Financial Services, an investment unit of the
company, has invested in wind farms in five countries, with 9.6
gigawatts of capacity, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
