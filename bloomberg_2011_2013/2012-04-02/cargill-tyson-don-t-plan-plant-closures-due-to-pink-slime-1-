Cargill Inc. and  Tyson Foods Inc., (TSN) 
the two largest U.S. beef processors, said they don’t plan to
close plants because of lower demand for finely textured beef,
also called “pink slime” by critics.  Cargill doesn’t plan closures or job cuts as it scales back
output of finely textured beef at two plants in  Texas , one in
 Nebraska  and one in Kansas, Mike Martin, a spokesman for the
Minneapolis-based company, said today in an e-mailed statement.
The output reduction comes after some retailers stopped using
the product in the ground beef they sell, the company said.  Celebrity chef  Jamie Oliver  is among food activists who
have criticized the use of what they dubbed “pink slime,” a
filler produced by treating finely ground beef scraps with
ammonia hydroxide to kill pathogens. The drop in demand led AFA
Foods, a ground-beef processor owned by Yucaipa Cos., to seek
bankruptcy court protection today. Beef Products Inc. last week
temporarily suspended production at three plants.  “The sale of beef trimmings is just a part of each of our
beef processing plants’ production and we do not expect this
issue to result in a plant closing,” Gary Mickelson, a
spokesman for Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson, said today in an
e-mail.  JBS USA, a unit of  JBS SA (JBSS3) , will “adjust our production
practices” if consumer preferences result in less demand,
spokeswoman Margaret McDonald said in an e-mail today. JBS sells
the trimmings used to make the contested product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
