Israel ’s budget deficit will probably
increase to 3.4 percent of gross domestic product this year as
growth slows, and narrow to 2.3 percent in 2013 as the economy
rebounds, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  Growth will probably accelerate to 3.8 percent next year,
the IMF said in a report on the Israeli economy today. The
economy grew 4.7 percent last year and the deficit was 3.3%, it
said.  While Israel’s  economy  “remains strong,” the global
downturn is slowing growth, the report said. About 40 percent of
the economy is made up of exports, with  Europe  and the U.S. the
key markets. The Bank of Israel raised its growth forecast for
this year to 3.1 percent from 2.8 percent on March 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
