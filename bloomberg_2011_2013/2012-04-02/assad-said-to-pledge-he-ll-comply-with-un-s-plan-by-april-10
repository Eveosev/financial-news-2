 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
told United Nations envoy  Kofi Annan  he’ll comply with elements
of a six-point peace plan, including a ceasefire, starting April
10, according to UN diplomats present at Annan’s briefing to the
 Security Council .  Annan told the UN Security Council via teleconference today
that Assad agreed to stop using heavy weapons on civilians and
to begin withdrawal from population centers, with implementation
of a ceasefire within 48 hours of the April 10 deadline,
according to the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity
because the briefing was closed to the public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
