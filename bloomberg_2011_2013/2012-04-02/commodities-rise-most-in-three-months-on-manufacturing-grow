The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of
24 commodities rose the most in three months, led by gains in
petroleum and metals, after a report showed manufacturing in the
U.S. expanded at a faster pace than forecast.  The index climbed 1.8 percent to 701.04 as of 3:30 p.m. in
 New York , the biggest one-day gain since Jan. 3, after the
 Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index increased to
53.4 last month from 52.4 in February, the Tempe, Arizona-based
group’s data showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey called for a gain to 53.  “The markets just took off,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at
PFG Best in Chicago. “It’s all economic based.”  Crude oil for May delivery rose $2.21, or 2.1 percent, to
settle at $105.23 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the biggest one-day increase since Feb. 21.  Prices are up 6.5
percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery advanced 7.41 cents, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $3.3822 a gallon in New York.  Natural gas for May delivery jumped 2.6 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $2.152 per million British thermal units
in New York, the biggest gain since March 16. The futures have
declined 28 percent this year, making gas the worst-performing
commodity on the S&P GSCI index of 24 raw materials.  Gold futures for June delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,679.70 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Bullion
advanced 6.7 percent last quarter.  Copper rose the most in more than five weeks. Futures for
May delivery climbed 2.5 percent to $3.921 a pound on the Comex
in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
