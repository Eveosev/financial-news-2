The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment fell,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 4 basis points to 156 basis points
as of 8:33 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge declined 47 basis points in the first
three months of the year, the biggest quarterly drop since the
period ended September 2009, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index retreated 3 basis points to
152 basis points as of 9:35 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The measure dropped 33 basis points last quarter,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index decreased 2.5 basis
points to 144.5 at 11:26 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The gauge ended the quarter down 33 basis points,
CMA data show, the second three-month decline.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
