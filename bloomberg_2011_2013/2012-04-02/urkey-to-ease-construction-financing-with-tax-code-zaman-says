Turkey  will ease financing pressures
for construction projects larger than $300 million with a tax
incentive allowing them to retain more capital,  Zaman newspaper 
reported.  Construction companies will receive refunds at the end of
each year for any value-added taxes they pay, whether or not the
project is completed, the Istanbul-based newspaper said, citing
unnamed officials from the  Economy Ministry .  The change is expected to ease financing for large
construction projects including hospitals and dams, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
