The sugar cane crop in  Brazil ’s
Center South, the main producing region of the world’s biggest
grower, will be smaller in the season staring this month than
estimated in March, according to Archer Consulting.  Cane output in the area will total 512 million metric tons,
Arnaldo Luiz Correa, a director at the Sao Paulo-based
consultancy, said in a report e-mailed March 31. It was Archer’s
third estimate for the crop and last month’s forecast was for
521 million tons. Production in the 2011-12 season totaled 494.3
million tons as of Feb. 15, data from industry group Unica show.
Most of the harvest has been gathered.  Sugar production will be 32.47 million tons, down from last
month’s forecast of 32.56 million tons, Archer said in the
report. Output this season reached 31.3 million tons as of Feb.
15, according to Unica. Sugar exports may reach 24.5 million
tons, according to the consultancy.  Ethanol production will be 21.4 billion liters (5.7 billion
gallons), down from last month’s forecast of 22.3 billion
liters, Correa said. Both sugar and ethanol are made from raw
material sugar cane in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
