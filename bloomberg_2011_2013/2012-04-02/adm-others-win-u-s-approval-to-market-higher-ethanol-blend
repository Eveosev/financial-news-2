Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) , Cargill
Inc. and 18 other companies received approval from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to market ethanol in a 15
percent blend with gasoline.  The approval comes more than 14 months after President
Barack Obama’s administration approved a waiver from the ethanol
industry to boost the allowable limit from 10 percent.  “For over 30 years ethanol has been blended into gasoline,
but the law limited it to 10 percent by volume for use in
gasoline-fueled vehicles,” the agency said in an e-mailed
statement. “Registration of ethanol to make E15 is a
significant step toward its production, sale and use” in cars
and light trucks produced in model year 2001 and later.  Growth Energy, an ethanol trade group, and the Renewable
Fuels Association pushed for the EPA to approve a waiver lifting
the limit in March 2009 to help an industry that saw at least a
dozen companies seek  bankruptcy protection  in 18 months.  E15 “has great potential,” said Bob Dinneen, president of
the association. “It doesn’t mean marketers across the country
are going to start offering this everywhere. Some are going to
take a step back and see how consumers adapt to it.”  Ethanol is mixed with gasoline to extend supplies and help
reduce U.S. dependence on crude oil. This year, gasoline prices
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  have surged 26 percent to
$3.3822 a gallon.  Gasoline’s Premium  Gasoline’s premium to ethanol touched a record $1.251 a
gallon on March 29, giving refiners an incentive to use more of
the biofuel to pocket the difference between the two, Dinneen
said.  Growth Energy, in an e-mailed statement, said filling
stations in the corn-rich Midwest may be the first to start
selling E15, perhaps this summer. The grain is used to make
ethanol in the U.S.  Under a 2007 law, the U.S. is required to consume 13.2
billion gallons of ethanol this year and 15 billion gallons by
2015. The industry has the capacity to produce 14.7 billion
gallons from its 210 refineries, according to the  Renewable
Fuels Association .  “To enable widespread use of E15, the Obama Administration
has set a goal to help fueling station owners install 10,000
blender pumps over the next 5 years,” EPA said.  Stockpiles of the biofuel fell 0.4 percent to 22.6 million
barrels in the week ended March 23 from a record 22.7 million
the previous seven days, the Energy Department said in its most
recent inventory report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
