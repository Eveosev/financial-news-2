U.S. technology stocks may drop at
least 10 percent after meeting resistance levels formed by the
retracement of losses after the dot-com crash a decade ago,
technical analysts at ING Groep NV and Mig Bank said.  The  Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP)  will probably decline toward its
200-day moving average of about 2,704, according to Ron William,
a technical analyst at Mig Bank in Neuchatel,  Switzerland . The
gauge rose 0.3 percent to 3,100.34 at 10:57 a.m. in  New York 
today, extending  the gauge’s rally this year  to 19 percent.  “The Nasdaq’s acceleration, although positive, is
unsustainable in the short term,” William said in a telephone
interview. “The index is testing a key historical price level
at the halfway mark of what it lost since the crash.”  The Nasdaq, which  sank 78 percent  from its high point in
March 2000 to its lowest level in October 2002, has recouped
half of that loss, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
William said the next resistance level for the index, or ceiling
limiting further gains, is 3,120 and the support level is 2,900.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Information Technology Index,
which posted its best quarterly gain since 2002 in the first
quarter as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  shares rallied, has reached a resistance
in an upward price channel and may fall to 435-430, said Roelof- Jan Van den Akker, senior technical strategist at ING in
Amsterdam. The measure was unchanged at 496.59 today.  Fibonacci Retracement  The S&P 500 technology gauge surged 21 percent in the first
quarter, crossing the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level
of the  83 percent drop  between March 27, 2000 and Oct. 9, 2002,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The coming decline will be a buying opportunity,” Van
den Akker said in a telephone interview. “The underlying trend
continues to be bullish.”  Apple’s  51 percent rally since the start of the year , which
has pushed its share price above $600, suggests that the  Nasdaq 
Composite will fall, according to William.  “It was almost a straight-line move to the $600 mark,” he
said before the company’s shares started trading today. “Apple
is likely to see a healthy pullback to the long-time 200-day
moving average, currently at $419.”  William said that the market has been in a counter-trend
rally, meaning the move has gone against the overall bearish
direction of the market. As part of an Elliott Wave pattern, the
market will soon enter a third phase as shares fall, the
technical analyst said.  William added that volatility is historically higher in the
spring and summer months, and this will result in the selloff of
riskier assets such as equities. The market cannot sustain its
current level of optimism, he said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
