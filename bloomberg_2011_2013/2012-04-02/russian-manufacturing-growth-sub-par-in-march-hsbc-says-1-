Russian manufacturing had a “sub-
par” expansion last month because of “modest” increases in
new orders and output, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to 50.8 in March from
50.7 in February, HSBC said in an e-mailed statement today,
citing data compiled by London-based Markit Economics. A level
above 50 signals an expansion, while below that shows a
contraction. Russia’s long-term trend level is 52.1, according
to the statement.  “Growth momentum in manufacturing remained subdued despite
somewhat faster output growth in March,”  Alexander Morozov ,
chief economist for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent
States at HSBC, said in the statement.  Risks to the economies of the  European Union (RUCREC)  and  China ,
which together account for about 60 percent of Russian trade,
threaten to stall demand for the country’s exports. New orders
from abroad returned to “sluggish growth” last month amid
signs of improving consumer demand in Russia’s CIS neighbors,
Morozov said.  The  Micex Manufacturing Index (MICEXMNF)  of 11 stocks advanced 0.3
percent to 21,22.38 as of 10:26 a.m. in Moscow. The benchmark
Micex Index advanced 0.9 percent to 1,530.76.  To contact the reporter on this story:
