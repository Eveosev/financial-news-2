PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  and  Renault SA (RNO) ,
the two largest French automakers, declined after reporting
weakening demand last month in their main home market.  Peugeot fell as much as 6.3 percent and Renault decreased
as much as 3.4 percent today in Paris trading. March vehicle
registrations in France dropped 22 percent to 233,526, the
country’s automakers’ association reported. Peugeot’s domestic
deliveries fell 32 percent, while Renault’s declined 25 percent.  “The wholesale market is going down after the French state
ended its scheme to stimulate domestic sales,” said  Marc-Rene Tonn , a Hamburg-based analyst at M.M. Warburg. “Peugeot and
Renault are hit by this reversal.”  Europe’s auto market is set to decrease 5 percent this year
because of weak economic growth, ratings agency  Standard &
Poor’s  said last week. The continent’s carmakers are also
struggling with manufacturing overcapacity, which executives
estimate at around 20 percent.  Peugeot announced plans in February to form a partnership
with  General Motors Co. (GM)  to help reduce operational costs. The
American carmaker took a 7 percent Peugeot stake as part of the
broad alliance.  Peugeot dropped as much as 77 cents to 11.31 euros and was
down 5.1 percent as of 2:36 p.m. in Paris. Renault fell as much
as 1.33 euros to 38.20 euros and traded 2.2 percent lower.  First-quarter deliveries of passenger cars and light
commercial vehicles fell 20 percent in France to 610,161.  To contact the reporter on this story:
