U.S. stocks remained little changed
after reports showed construction spending unexpectedly
decreased, while a gauge of manufacturing industries rose more
than forecast.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,408.89 at 10:03 a.m. in  New York .  Construction spending decreased 1.1 percent in February,
government data showed, compared with the median economist
forecast for growth of 0.6 percent.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index rose to
53.4 in March from 52.4 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s data showed today. Fifty is the dividing line
between growth and contraction, and economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected the gauge would climb to 53. Estimates
of the 72 economists ranged from 51.7 to 54.5.  The  S&P 500  rose 12 percent from January through March, its
best first quarter, since 1998 as economic data surpassed
estimates and investors speculated that the euro area would
contain its sovereign-debt crisis. The benchmark measure
advanced 3.1 percent in March, its fourth straight monthly
increase for the gauge’s longest streak of
monthly gains since 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
