Thessaloniki Port Authority SA (OLTH)  will
invite Aktor SA to take on a project to extend Pier 6 of
Greeceâ€™s second-biggest port after the authority disqualified
 Mochlos SA (MOCHL) , which originally won the contract,  Imerisia  said.  Mochlos was unable to provide a letter to guarantee
construction while Aktor, a unit of  Ellaktor SA (ELLAKTOR) , which came
second in the original tender, can provide the document, the
Athens-based newspaper reported today, without citing anyone.  Starting construction work on the container pier will be
delayed by at least one month, Imerisia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
