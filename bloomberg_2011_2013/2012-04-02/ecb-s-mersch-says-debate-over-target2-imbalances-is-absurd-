European Central Bank council member
 Yves Mersch  said the debate about imbalances in the euro area’s
payments system, known as Target2, is “absurd.”  It is a “curious, badly informed debate,” Mersch said
today while presenting the Luxembourg Central Bank’s annual
report. “The debate only makes sense if you are predicting the
explosion of the euro zone. This is not at all our scenario. It
is completely absurd, even improper.”  Mersch said that claims being built up by  Germany ’s
Bundesbank and the Bank of Luxembourg are similar to imbalances
that went in the opposite direction a decade ago and reflect a
“huge liquidity inflow,” especially into Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
