KKR & Co. (KKR) , which teamed up two years
ago with Premier Natural Resources LLC to buy oil and gas assets
in  North America , agreed to acquire properties in the Barnett
shale and Arkoma basin from WPX Energy Inc. for $306 million.  KKR Natural Resources, the firm’s joint venture with
Premier, will buy 27,000 net acres in north central Texas and
eastern Oklahoma and 66,000 net acres in the Arkoma basin from
Tulsa, Oklahoma-based WPX, the New York-based private equity
firm said in an e-mailed statement today.  “We see attractive opportunities to invest behind the
development of domestic energy resources and remain excited
about the opportunity to grow our natural resources platform,”
Jonathan Smidt, Head of KKR Natural Resources, said.  KKR, the buyout firm run by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , along with rivals including Blackstone Group LP are
buying energy assets as the price of oil climbs and the world’s
largest energy companies sell mature oil and gas fields to
finance new exploration.  Today’s purchase is KKR Natural Resources’s third in the
Barnett shale, KKR said today. The properties have a current net
production of about 67 million cubic feet per day, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
