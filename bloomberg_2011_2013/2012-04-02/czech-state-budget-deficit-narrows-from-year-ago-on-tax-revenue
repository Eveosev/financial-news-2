The Czech central state  budget
deficit  narrowed in the first three months from a year earlier
on larger  tax revenue , the  Finance Ministry  said.  The budget deficit totaled 22.69 billion koruna ($1.22
billion) in the January-March period, compared with a 25.2
billion-koruna gap in the same period last year, the Prague-
based ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. Tax income
was 11 billion koruna more than last year, it said.  The government plans to narrow the deficit of broader
public finances, where the central budget is the biggest part,
to 3.5 percent of economic output this year, from 3.7 percent in
2011. It raised the value-added tax and agreed to freeze part of
spending to meet the deficit goal.  Budget revenue totaled 258.45 billion koruna in the first
three months, and expenditure stood at 281.13 billion koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
