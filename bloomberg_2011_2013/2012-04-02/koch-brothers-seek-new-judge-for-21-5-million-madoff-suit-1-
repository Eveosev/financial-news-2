Koch Industries Inc., the company
run by billionaire brothers Charles and  David Koch , asked a
district judge to review a $21.5 million lawsuit filed against
it by the liquidator of Bernard Madoff’s firm.  Madoff trustee Irving Picard sued the company in bankruptcy
court in February demanding return of money withdrawn from a
feeder fund that invested with Madoff. His suit is similar to
Picard’s complaint against the New York Mets owners, which was
taken over by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff to decide such
issues as whether the trustee can recoup money from parties that
acted in good faith, Koch Industries said in a filing today in
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  One of the largest closely held companies in the world,
 Koch Industries  has businesses in chemicals, refining, consumer
products and commodities trading.  Charles Koch  is chairman and
chief executive officer of the company, and David Koch is an
executive vice president.  Madoff is serving 150 years in federal prison for running
the biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.  The case is Picard v. Koch Industries Inc., 12-01047, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
