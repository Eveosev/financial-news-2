Economists covering  Brazil  cut their
forecast for inflation over the next 12 months for the first
time in six weeks after the central bank said on March 29 that
the inflation outlook had improved since December.  Consumer prices will increase 5.4 percent in the next 12
months, down from the previous estimate of 5.41 percent,
according to a weekly  central bank survey  of about 100
economists published today.  Analysts expect the central bank to cut the benchmark rate
to 9 percent by the end of the year, and to raise it back to the
10 percent in 2013, the survey found. Central bank President
Alexandre Tombini cut borrowing costs by 2.75 percentage points
to 9. 75 percent since August, more than any other central
banker in the Group of 20 Nations.  “The focus of monetary policy was, is and will continue to
be inflation,” the central bank’s economic policy director
Carlos Hamilton said last week.  Economists cut their estimate for economic growth this year
to 3.2 percent, from 3.23 percent. Brazil’s economy will grow
4.2 percent next year, according to the survey, down from a
previous estimate of 4.29 percent.  Consumer prices will rise 5.27 percent this year, analysts
estimated, compared with the forecast of 5.28 percent the
previous week. The economists held their forecast for 2013
inflation at 5.5 percent.  The annual inflation rate fell to 5.61 percent in the mid-
March, its slowest pace since 2010, after exceeding the upper
limit of the target for eight months last year. Brazil  targets 
annual consumer price rises of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  The real weakened 6 percent last month, the worst performer
of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
