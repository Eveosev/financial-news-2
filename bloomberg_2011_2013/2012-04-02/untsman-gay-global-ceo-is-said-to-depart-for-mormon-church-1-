Robert Gay, co-founder of Huntsman
Gay Global Capital LLC, is stepping down as chief executive
officer at the private-equity firm for a full-time position with
the Church of  Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints, according to a
person familiar with the plans.  Gay was called last month to be a member of the First
Quorum of the Seventy, a group of ecclesiastical leaders based
in Salt Lake City, according to a March 31  news release  from the
church. He co-founded the Palo Alto, California-based firm in
2007 with Jon Huntsman, father of former presidential candidate
Jon Huntsman Jr. and chairman of chemical maker  Huntsman Corp. (HUN)   Gay, 60, a former managing director at Bain Capital LLC,
resigned from that firm in 2004 after 15 years to volunteer in
Africa for the Mormon church, according to Huntsman Gay’s
website. He is a supporter of fellow Mormon and former Bain
Capital CEO Mitt Romney for U.S. president.  Huntsman and Gay both plan to give their share of their
firm’s profits to charity, a company spokesman said in 2009.
Huntsman Gay’s partners include  Steve Young , the retired
National Football League quarterback, and  Gary Crittenden , a
former Citigroup Inc. executive.  Huntsman Gay finished raising its first fund in 2009,
collecting $1.1 billion amid an industry slump. Fortune Magazine
reported Gay’s departure earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
