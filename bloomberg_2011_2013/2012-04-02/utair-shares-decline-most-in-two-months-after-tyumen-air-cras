Russian aviation group UTair
retreated the most in almost two months after one of its planes
crashed in the Tyumen region, killing at least 31 of the 43
passengers and crew on board.  The shares slid as much as 4.9 percent before closing 2.3
percent lower at 19.913 rubles Moscow, the biggest decline since
Feb. 17.  The plane, which had just taken off from Tyumen en route to
Surgut, crashed while trying to make an emergency landing three
kilometers (1.9 miles) from the airport, UTair said on its
website, without elaborating on the cause of the accident. More
than 200 emergency workers arrived at the scene, the countryâ€™s
Emergency Ministry said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
