Italian bonds led gains among
 Europe ’s higher-yielding government securities after a survey
showed Chinese manufacturing improved in March, adding to
optimism the global economy is recovering.  Italy’s 10-year securities advanced for a second day as a
gauge of the nation’s factory output unexpectedly increased this
month.  China ’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index climbed to a one-year
high, the report showed yesterday. German bunds snapped a four-
day advance as the country sold 3.27 billion euros ($4.35
billion) of six-month bills.  “We’ve already had a broad boost to risk appetite from
China’s PMI,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “Then
this morning we’ve had the euro-zone data, which has seen  Italy 
beat expectations while  Spain  remains at very low levels.
Lastly, it’s the beginning of the quarter and last week’s profit
taking probably went too far.”  The Italian 10-year yield dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage points, to 5.10 percent at 4:21 p.m. London time
after falling nine basis points on March 30. The 5 percent bond
due March 2022 gained 0.16, or 1.60 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 99.75. The nation’s two-year yield fell eight basis
points to 2.84 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italy 10-year
securities over similar-maturity bunds shrank to 330 basis
points. The spread narrowed to 276 basis points on March 16, the
least since Aug. 18.  ‘Great Progress’  The euro region has made “great progress” in dealing with
its sovereign-debt crisis but it would be dangerous to be too
complacent, Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said in Beijing
on March 31.  “Italian rates are coming down smoothly,” said  Matteo Regesta , a senior fixed-income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in
London. “The market appreciates the efforts of the Prime
Minister to make sure overseas investors understand what’s
happening in Italy, particularly labor reform. Italy should be
relatively stable going forward.”  Spanish bonds also advanced, with the 10-year yield
dropping one basis point to 5.34 percent. The spread over bunds
narrowed two basis points to 354 basis points.  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index for manufacturing
advanced to 53.1 in March, the logistics federation and the
National Bureau of Statistics said. The Italian manufacturing
gauge climbed to 47.9, Markit Economics said today, surpassing
the prediction of 47.7 in a Bloomberg News  survey .  Euro-region manufacturing contracted in March, with an
indicator declining to 47.7 from 49 in February. That’s in line
with an initial estimate released last month.  Bunds Fall  The German 10-year yield rose one basis point to 1.80
percent after earlier climbing as much as seven basis points to
1.86 percent.  Germany  sold six-month bills at an average yield of 0.066
percent, compared with 0.053 percent at the previous auction on
March 12. Investors bid for 1.43 times the amount allotted,
versus 1.64 times last month.  Dutch 10-year bonds fell two basis points to 2.31 percent
after the Netherlands sold 2.14 billion euros of 86- and 267-day
bills. French two-year notes rose, with the yield slipping three
basis points to 0.53 percent, after it auctioned 7.4 billion
euros of bills.  German bunds returned 0.3 percent last quarter, their worst
performance in a year, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Portuguese bonds gained 13 percent, the biggest
advance among 26 sovereign markets tracked by the indexes.  Bond Futures  Italian 10-year bond futures may climb to a 10-month high
should they close above a key level of so-called resistance, UBS
AG said, citing trading patterns.  The contracts have “broken above the immediate resistance
offered by the 38 percent retracement of the March selloff at
104.99,”  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical
strategy at UBS in  London , wrote in a research note. Should the
price close above this level, “we will be looking for a fresh
extension of the long-term uptrend and a test of resistance
offered by the 138 percent extension of the March selloff at
109.54,” he said.  The 10-year contract expiring in June rose 0.1 percent to
104.77 after climbing as much as 0.9 percent to 105.56. The so-
called lead contract last traded as high as 109.54 on June 6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Resistance refers to an
area where sell orders may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
