U.S. stocks gained, with the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index returning to an almost four-year
high, and commodities reversed early losses following a report
showing stronger-than-forecast growth in American manufacturing.
Oil rallied the most in six weeks.  The  S&P 500  advanced 0.8 percent to close at 1,419.04 at 4
p.m. in New York, adding to its 12 percent first-quarter rally.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 52.45 points to
13,264.49, the highest since December 2007. The S&P  GSCI (SPGSCI)  Index
rose 1.7 percent as heating oil, gasoline and copper led gains
in 19 of 24 commodities. Ten-year Treasury yields lost two basis
points to 2.19 percent after decreasing as much as five points.  Stocks and commodities recovered from earlier losses after
the  Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing index
increased to 53.4 last month and a gauge of factory employment
climbed to the highest level since June. The data helped assuage
concern about the global economy after earlier reports showed
European unemployment rose to a 14-year high in February and
 manufacturing  contracted for an eighth month in March.  “Here in the  United States , things have stabilized,”
 Barry James , who helps oversee $3.3 billion as president of
James Investment Research in Xenia,  Ohio , said in a telephone
interview. “The manufacturing side has been the strength of our
economy and the exporting has been huge -- that’s what has
sustained us the past several years.”  Market Movers  The S&P 500 needs to rise only about 10 percent to reach
its previous record high of 1,565.15 set in October 2007.  Gains
in U.S. stocks today  were led by producers of raw materials and
energy, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. rallying 2.8
percent and Chevron Corp. rising 1 percent to pace the advance.
Avon Products Inc. surged 17 percent after Coty Inc. offered to
buy the cosmetics company for $10 billion.  Apple Inc. advanced 3.2 percent after  Consumer Reports  said
on its website that the new iPad’s high-resolution screen
provides the best detail and color accuracy of all tablets it
has seen.  Groupon Inc. slid 17 percent after the largest provider of
daily online deals reported a “material weakness” in its
financial controls and said fourth-quarter results were worse
than previously stated because of higher refunds to merchants.  The S&P 500 reversed a drop of 0.3 percent in the first
hour of trading after the ISM’s factory index topped the median
economist forecast of 53. The group’s production gauge climbed
to a three-month high and its measure of employment reached the
highest level since June.  The best first-quarter gain for the S&P 500 since 1998 sent
U.S. stocks above gold by the most in more than a decade, a sign
of growing investor confidence in corporate profits as analysts
raise  earnings estimates  for the first time this year.  Quarterly Returns  The S&P 500 climbed 12 percent, 5.3 percentage points more
than gold for the widest gap to start a year since 1999,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P GSCI Total
Return Index of 24 commodities gained 5.9 percent over the three
months, while Treasuries slipped 1.3 percent, trailing equities
by the most since 2009. Corporate bonds increased 2.4 percent
and the dollar fell 1.6 percent.  Thirty-year Treasury bonds fell today, erasing earlier
gains and sending their yield one basis point higher to 3.35
percent. Two-year yields were little changed at 0.33 percent.  The worst is over for the $10 trillion U.S. Treasury market
following the biggest quarterly rout since 2010, say Wall
Street’s largest bond trading firms.  After rising to  as high as  2.4 percent last month from 1.88
percent at the end of 2011, the yield on the benchmark 10-year
note will finish 2012 at 2.49 percent, according to the average
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of the 21 primary dealers
that trade with the  Federal Reserve . That’s the same as a
January poll, suggesting the market isn’t ready to declare a
 bear market  in bonds after a 30-year bull run.  Treasury Bets  Signs of strength in the economy, which caused a 5.56
percent loss in bonds maturing in 10 years or more last quarter,
may fade in the second half of 2012, the dealers say. Tax cuts
are expiring, $1 trillion of mandatory federal budget cuts are
due to kick in and $100-a-barrel oil is eating into  consumer
spending . With inflation in check, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said last week that the central bank will consider further
stimulus, even after upgrading its economic outlook March 13.  Among commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI index, heating
oil, gasoline and nickel surged more than 2.2 percent. Oil for
May delivery rose $2.21, or 2.1 percent, to settle at $105.23 a
barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. It was the biggest
gain since Feb. 21.  China Manufacturing  Commodities also advanced after data showed manufacturing
growth in  China . A  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to a one-year
high of 53.1 in March, China’s logistics federation and the
National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday. The gauge has a
pattern of rising each March. The data failed to end predictions
for policy loosening as analysts described the gain as seasonal
and a separate survey showed exporters struggling.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  increased 1.5 percent as
national benchmark gauges in the U.K. and  Germany  led gains in
the region. Among European  stocks , Oriflame Cosmetics SA jumped
2.6 percent after Coty’s offer for Avon. Cookson Group Plc
jumped 6 percent after the Sunday Times said the company may
spin off a unit.  European Debt  The yield on Italian 10-year bonds dropped one basis point
to 5.11 percent, leaving the difference in yield with bunds two
basis points lower. The Spanish 10-year yield was little changed
at 5.35 percent.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps tied to the debt of 15 governments dropped 3.2
basis points to 266.75.  The yen appreciated 1 percent versus the euro, while the
Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against those of
six trading partners, lost 0.2 percent.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index added 0.7 percent. In  South
Korea , the Kospi Index advanced 0.8 percent after the country’s
credit rating outlook was raised by Moody’s Investors Service to
positive from stable, boosting demand for the nation’s assets.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Shares Index advanced 1.3 percent
in Johannesburg. The ISE National 100 Index added 0.9 percent in
Istanbul after Turkish economic growth in the fourth quarter was
5.2 percent, exceeding economists’ estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
