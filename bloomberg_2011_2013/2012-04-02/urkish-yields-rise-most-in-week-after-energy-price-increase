Turkish bonds yields increased the
most in more than a week after the government raised electricity
and natural gas prices, threatening the central bank’s battle
against double-digit inflation.  Yields (BENCH)  on the two-year debt added seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 9.38 percent at 5 p.m. in Istanbul,
the biggest jump since March 22. The lira was little changed at
1.7845 per dollar.  The government increased natural gas prices by between 16.4
percent and 18.7 percent, the state pipeline company said March
31. It follows an 8.1 percent jump in electricity prices also
announced by the energy regulator. Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci said last month inflation will slow “significantly” from
May.  “The expected fall in inflation in May is likely to be
delayed more,” Ali Cakiroglu, a strategist at  HSBC Private
Bank , in Istanbul said by telephone. “An inflation rate
hovering around at 10 percent well into the third quarter will
exert pressure on bonds.”   Inflation (TUCPIY)  cooled to 10.4 percent in February from a three-
year high of 10.6 percent in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
