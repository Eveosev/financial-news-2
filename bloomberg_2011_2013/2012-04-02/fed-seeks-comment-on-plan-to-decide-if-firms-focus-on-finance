The Federal Reserve Board of
Governors is seeking comment on requirements for determining
whether a company is “predominantly engaged in financial
activities.”  The Fed is working to establish the criteria by which
companies can be designated for supervision by the Financial
Stability Oversight Council. The deadline for comments on the
proposed amendment to the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory
changes is May 25, the central bank said today in a statement in
 Washington .  Under the Dodd-Frank law a company can be designated for
supervision under the council only if 85 percent or more of the
company’s revenues or assets are related to activities that are
financial in nature under the Bank Holding Company Act.  To contact the reporter on this story:
