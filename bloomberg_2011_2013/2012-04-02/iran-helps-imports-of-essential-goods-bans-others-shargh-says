Iran ’s Central Bank is providing
foreign currencies at the official  exchange rate  to importers of
essential goods while importers of 180 luxury products will have
to buy foreign currencies at the market rate,  Shargh  reported.  The government has separately listed about 600 goods that
are temporarily banned from being imported, Shargh said, citing
the director of Iran’s Trade Promotion Organization, Hamid
Safdel. Some of the 600 items have domestic equivalents. The
report didn’t name any goods in the three categories cited.  Iran’s Central Bank has fixed the exchange rate at 12,260
rials for the dollar. The Association for Exchange of Iran
 listed  the market rate at 19,080 rials at 2:35 p.m. Tehran time
today. Iran’s Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  has called
on Iranians to buy domestic products instead of imported ones to
strengthen the economy in the face of international sanctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
