Gafisa SA (GFSA3) ,  Brazil ’s fifth-biggest
homebuilder by revenue, plunged to the lowest in more than three
years after posting an annual loss last year amid cost overruns
and canceled sales.  Shares  fell  4.9 percent to 4.09 reais at 11:25 a.m. in Sao
Paulo. A close at that level would be the lowest since December
2008. The company is the worst performer on the BM&F Bovespa
Real Estate  index , which dropped 0.5 percent today. The
benchmark Bovespa advanced 0.9 percent.  Gafisa posted a loss of 1.05 billion reais ($572 million)
in 2011, compared with a profit of 440 million reais in 2010,
according to preliminary results released yesterday. That
included total adjustments of 889.5 million reais related to
cost overruns, scaling back its Tenda unit and canceled
contracts with potential homeowners who no longer qualify for
mortgages, the company said.  The figures “reflect the continuous deterioration” of the
company’s results as “a great part of the necessary adjustments
were left for the end of the year,” Credit Suisse Group AG
analysts Guilherme Rocha, Daniel Gasparete and  Vanessa Quiroga 
wrote in a note dated yesterday. “Dealing with a record high
leverage and an unclear outlook, we continue to recommend
investors to be cautious on the stock.”  Credit Suisse has the equivalent of a hold recommendation
on Gafisa’s shares.  The average estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey
was for Gafisa to report adjusted net income of 104 million
reais for 2011.  Gafisa forecasts new projects in 2012 ranging from 2.7
billion reais to 3.3 billion reais, deliveries of 22,000 to
26,000 units and operating cash flow of 500 million reais and
700 million reais, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
