Tata Sons Ltd. employees sent to the
U.S. from  India  to work in information technology jobs who are
suing over wages in  California  won permission to proceed with
class-action status.  U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in Oakland, California,
issued the class certification order today, according to a
statement from lawyers representing the workers and distributed
by Businesswire. The employees alleged breach of contract and
violation of California labor laws, according to the statement.  Tata and its Tata Consultancy Services unit forced non-U.S.
citizen employees to sign over their federal and state tax
refunds to the company and deprived employees in California of
earned wages by deducting their Indian salary from their
compensation, according to the statement.  Michelle LaMar, a lawyer representing Mumbai-based Tata,
didnâ€™t immediately return a call seeking comment on the
certification.  The case is Vedachalam v. Tata America International Corp.,
06-cv-00963, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
