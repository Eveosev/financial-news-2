Mexico ’s peso gained for the first
time in five days as speculation central bank policy makers may
cut  interest rates  boosted investor demand for the country’s
fixed-rate bonds.  The peso appreciated 0.6 percent to 12.7326 per  U.S. dollar 
at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, from 12.8107 on March 30. The peso has
gained 9.4 percent this year, the most among major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s central bank directors were unanimous in their
decision announced March 16 to keep the  target lending rate  at a
record low 4.5 percent for a 25th consecutive meeting, according
to the minutes, released March 30. Most of the board members
agreed that “if current favorable conditions in the inflation
outlook are consolidated” it may be advisable to lower the
benchmark rate, the minutes said.  “The potential cuts drive appetite” for local bonds,
 Eduardo Suarez , a currency strategist at Bank of  Nova Scotia ’s
Scotia Capital unit, said by phone from Toronto. “If you expect
cuts, then the bond prices should rise as long as inflation
expectations remain anchored.”  Yields on Mexican fixed-rate peso bonds maturing in
December 2013 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
to 4.71 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price rose 0.10 centavo to 105.41 centavos per peso.  The yields on peso-denominated debt due in 2024 declined
four basis points to 6.43 percent, according to Bloomberg data.
The price rose 0.39 centavo to 130.92 centavos per peso.  The peso extended gains after a report showed stronger-
than-forecast growth in U.S. manufacturing, according to Suarez.
Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the world’s
biggest economy.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index climbed
to 53.4 last month from 52.4 in February, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s report showed today. Readings greater than 50
signal growth. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a gain to 53.  Mexico sold all 7 billion pesos of 29-day Cetes and 8
billion pesos of the 92-day securities it offered today, the
central bank said on its website.  Mexico also sold all 8.5 billion pesos in 183-day bills it
auctioned and 9.5 billion pesos in the 365-day notes, the bank
said. The yield at auction on the one-month notes fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.25 percent from the
previous auction on March 27, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
