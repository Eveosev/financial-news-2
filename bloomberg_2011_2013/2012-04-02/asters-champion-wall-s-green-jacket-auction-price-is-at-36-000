A Masters Tournament green jacket
will be given out April 7, a day before a champion is crowned.  Art Wall Jr.’s 1959 championship jacket, an item
traditionally given to the winner of the competition at Augusta
National Golf Club in Augusta,  Georgia , is up for auction, with
the  current price  at $36,498, according to Green Jacket
Auctions.  Bidding opened at $500 on March 21 and is scheduled to
close at 8 p.m.  New York  time April 7, about an hour after the
third round should finish.  There have been 31 bids on the jacket, which has Wall’s
name embroidered inside and was given to him a month after he
shot a final-round 66, with birdies on five of the last six
holes, to beat Cary Middlecoff by a stroke and  Arnold Palmer  by
two. Champions are given stock jackets for the award ceremony
and then have fitted jackets made for them after the event.  Masters champions now may only bring their jacket home for
one year before returning with it to defend their title, and all
other jackets must remain at the club. Prior to 1961, champions
were allowed to keep their jackets and have never been asked to
return them, according to GreenJacketAuctions.com. Doug Ford’s
1957 champion’s jacket was auctioned in 2010 for $63,000 by the
company, which lists its home as Denville,  New Jersey , and
Tampa, Florida.  Wall died on Oct. 31, 2001, from respiratory failure
related to pneumonia, according to the New York Times. He was a
14-time winner on the U.S.  PGA Tour  and won the Masters after
trailing by five strokes with seven holes to play.  The jacket’s seller wasn’t disclosed, though it is not
Wall’s family, according to the website.  The Masters, the golf season’s first major tournament,
begins April 5, with Charl Schwartzel of  South Africa  defending
his title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
