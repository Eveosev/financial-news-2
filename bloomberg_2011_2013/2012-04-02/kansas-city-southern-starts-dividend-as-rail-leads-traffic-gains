Kansas City Southern (KSU) , the smallest
of the seven largest North American railroads, started a
quarterly cash dividend of 19.5 cents a share after leading the
industry’s growth in freight traffic in 2011.  The first payment will be made April 27 to stockholders of
record April 16, the Kansas City, Missouri-based company said
today in a statement. The dividend rate indicates total
annualized payments of about $85.6 million, the company said. On
the basis of the March 30 closing price of $71.69 a share, the
annual yield is about 1.1 percent.  Kansas City Southern is returning cash to investors after
carloads advanced 8.3 last year and profit climbed 83 percent,
according to a company filing. Traffic rose 5.2 percent at
Norfolk Southern Corp., which had the second-biggest climb.  “As a company with abundant future growth opportunities,
as well as sufficient cash on hand and strong cash flows, we
believe KCS can continue to be a leading growth company while
returning cash to our stockholders,” Chief Executive Officer
David Starling said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
