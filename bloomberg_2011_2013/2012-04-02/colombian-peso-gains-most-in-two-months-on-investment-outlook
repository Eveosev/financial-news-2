Colombia ’s peso rose the most in two
months on speculation the expanding economy will keep attracting
investment from abroad.  The peso appreciated 0.7 percent to 1,775.66 per  U.S.
dollar  from 1,788.75 on March 30. The gain was the biggest since
Jan. 18. It has jumped 9.2 percent this year, the second-best
performance after the Mexican peso among the six most-traded
Latin America currencies.  The peso touched a six-week low on March 29, a day after
Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said the central bank
should consider boosting dollar purchases and study possible
“surprise” moves to halt the currency’s advance. In a bid to
ease gains in the peso, the central bank has said it will
purchase a minimum of $20 million daily in the  spot market  until
at least Aug. 4.  “The peso is going back to its strengthening trend as good
economic results and high  interest rates  are attracting both
foreign direct investment and portfolio investment,” said
Julian Marquez, an analyst in Bogota at Interbolsa SA,
Colombia’s largest brokerage. “The peso will have its days of
weakening as we get verbal intervention, but the general trend
is for it to trade between 1,750 and 1,770.”  Colombia’s economy grew 5.9 percent in 2011, the biggest
annual jump since gross domestic product expanded 6.9 percent in
2007, according to a March 22 government report.  The yield on the country’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 7.23 percent, according to the central bank. The price
rose 0.174 centavo to 122.021 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
