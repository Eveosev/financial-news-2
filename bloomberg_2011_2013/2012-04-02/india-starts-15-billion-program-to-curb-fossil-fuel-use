India  started a program that imposes
energy-saving targets on companies including  Reliance Industries
Ltd. (RIL) ,  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , ordering them
to reduce fossil-fuel consumption by 2015.  Starting yesterday, 563 facilities such as oil refineries,
steel plants and paper mills must begin improving the efficiency
with which they consume energy over the next three years,
according to program  rules  and  targets  published on the website
of the Ministry of Power.  The program seeks to lower fossil-fuel use in the world’s
third-largest energy consumer by forcing eight industries to
curtail their power needs. Companies can buy and sell credits to
meet their obligations and trading could reach 740 billion
rupees ($15 billion) annually in five years, according to
projections by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency.  The goals are measured in terms of metric tons of oil
equivalent.  By using energy more efficiently and reducing losses, India
may avoid building 10,000 megawatts of new power capacity,
saving 1 trillion rupees,  according to  the power ministry.
That’s the equivalent of about nine new nuclear reactors.  Companies with facilities falling under the program include
 NTPC Ltd. (NATP) ,  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , Essar Steel Ltd.,  JSW Steel
Ltd. (JSTL)  and  Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR) , according to the list of targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
