last year when the company’s shares  gained  12 percent.  Bewkes, 59, received total compensation of $25.9 million

bonus, with the remainder in stock awards and benefits,

international growth. Subscription fees for TV shows advanced 5
percent.  The company announced in February it would raise its
quarterly  dividend  by 11 percent to 26 cents a share, and

Analysts had expected a gain of about 9 percent. Bewkes’s
current employment agreement ends Dec. 31 of this year.  Time Warner fell 0.4 percent to $37.59 at the close in  New
