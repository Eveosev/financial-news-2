ArcelorMittal (ACL)  South Africa Ltd. will
be excluded from the government’s preferential procurement
policy, which is designed to benefit local manufacturers,
Business Day  reported , citing Nimrod Zalk, deputy director-
general of the Department of Trade and Industry.  All steel, regardless of origin, will be regarded as
locally manufactured to prevent  ArcelorMittal (MT) , the dominant
supplier, from pushing up prices, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper quoted Zalk as saying.  The steelmaker said its exclusion will have a minimal
impact on current prices and will further worsen the industry’s
competitive position. It may lead to further job losses, the
newspaper reported, citing ArcelorMittal spokesman Themba Hlengani.  To contact the reporter on this story:
