Egypt ’s net international reserves
dropped to $15.1 billion at the end of March, the 15th
consecutive monthly fall.  The reserves fell by $599 million from about $15.7 billion
in February, the central bank said on its website, the smallest
decline since the start of the revolt that ousted  Hosni Mubarak .  “I take some comfort from the moderation in the pace of
reserve decline,” said  Simon Williams , chief economist at HSBC
 Middle East , who had estimated a drop of $650 million.  “But I
think this reflects the depletion of the capital stock, not an
improvement in the underlying external account position.”  Egypt’s international reserves have plunged by more than
half since the uprising. The North African country is seeking a
$3.2 billion International Monetary Fund loan to help an economy
that is struggling to recover from a drop in investment and
tourism.  Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Fayza Aboulnaga said today Egypt aims to sign a memorandum of
understanding with the fund in June. She said the IMF wants
broad backing from political groups in the country before
approval is granted  The Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, which
makes up the largest bloc in parliament, has said the government
hasn’t proved it’s exhausted all alternatives before seeking
external debt. It has also criticized the government’s loan-
linked economic program as too vague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
