Rede Energia SA (REDE4) , the holding company
of nine Brazilian power distributors, is seeking to renegotiate
the terms of its dollar bonds five weeks after unit Centrais
Eletricas do Para SA filed for bankruptcy.  Sao Paulo-based Rede Energia said in a statement today that
it will begin talks with bondholders as part of a financial
restructuring of the company. Rede Energia said it hired
Rothschild as its financial advisor.  Rede Energia’s perpetual bonds have plunged since Celpa, as
the unit is known, defaulted on its dollar bonds on Feb. 28 and
Chairman Jorge Queiroz de Moraes Jr. failed to find a buyer for
all or part of his stake in the parent company.  Fitch Ratings 
cut Rede Energia’s rating two levels to C, or one step above
default, on March 9, saying Celpa’s bankruptcy will likely
prevent the parent from accessing the credit needed to roll over
its short-term debt.  The price of Rede Energia’s $497 million of bonds has
tumbled 30 cents since Feb. 27, the day before Celpa sought
relief from creditors, to 53.5 cents on the dollar, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Rede Energia said today that it made an interest payment on
its perpetual notes and has enough funds to make the next two
interest payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
