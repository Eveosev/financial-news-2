Eli Jacobs, who once owned the
Baltimore Orioles baseball team, was sued for breaching a
contract by Michael Quinn, who retired from Merrill Lynch in
1999 as vice chairman of the asset-management division.  The lawsuit, which seeks $431,000 in damages, was filed on
March 30 in federal court in  Manhattan . According to Quinn,
Jacobs refused to honor a promise to repurchase Quinnâ€™s
investment in Alternative Packaging Solutions LLC, a company
started by Jacobs.  Quinn said he made the investment after Jacobs promised him
a senior managerial role at APS and another company. Quinn said
in his complaint that he sought to recover his investment after
the two men failed to agree on employment terms.  David Ross , a lawyer for Jacobs, declined to immediately
comment on the complaint. Merrill Lynch is now a unit of
Charlotte, North Carolina-based  Bank of America Corp .  The case is Quinn v. Jacobs, 12-cv-2423, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
