Bill Gross ’s  Pimco Total Return (PTTRX) 
Fund, the world’s biggest mutual fund, attracted $1.7 billion of
investor deposits in the first quarter as performance rebounded.  The fund last had deposits in the third quarter of 2011,
when it brought in $2.3 billion, according to data compiled by
Chicago-based  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  Investors pulled about $3 billion
from the fund in the three months ended Dec. 31, bringing
withdrawals last year to $5 billion, Morningstar said.  The $252 billion Pimco Total Return has advanced 2.9
percent this year, beating 97 percent of similarly managed
funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund last
year gained 4.2 percent, lagging behind 69 percent of its peers,
after Gross missed a rally in U.S. Treasuries and put money into
riskier assets.  Gross, who eliminated Treasuries from his portfolio in
February 2011, had been increasing his holdings of the
securities until this February, when he reduced the proportion
of U.S. government securities to  37 percent  of assets, from 38
percent in January, according to Pimco’s website.  Investors put a net $6.4 billion into Jeffrey Gundlach’s
 DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund (DBLTX)  in the first quarter,
following deposits of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter,
according to Morningstar. Gundlach’s fund has risen 3 percent
this year, beating 97 percent of rivals, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
