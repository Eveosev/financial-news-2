Spain ’s government is determined to
tackle its debt and there’s no need to discuss bailing out the
euro area’s fourth-largest economy, according to an envoy of
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party.  “From what I see, there is no necessity at the moment for
there to be any talk of Spain having to apply for aid from a
rescue fund,”  Volker Kauder , parliamentary leader of Merkel’s
Christian Democratic bloc, said late yesterday after meeting
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  and other Spanish officials in
Madrid.  Spain is doing “everything it can” to reach Rajoy’s goal
of reducing the  budget deficit  to 5.3 percent of gross domestic
product in 2012, Kauder told reporters, speaking through a
translator. “It is possible to achieve it.”  Rajoy defied European Union allies by raising Spain’s
deficit target on March 2, hours after he and 24 other EU
leaders signed the German-inspired fiscal pact to stem excessive
debt. Merkel cited “fragility” in Spain and Portugal when she
announced last week that Germany backed an increase in Europe’s
financial backstop against the crisis.  Kauder, in a separate e-mailed statement, called Spain “a
partner for a stability culture in  Europe ” and said Rajoy’s
reforms during his first 100 days in office had put the country
“on the right track.”  “I got an excellent impression of the government’s
determination to master the debt crisis and achieve the savings
goals agreed with the EU,” Kauder said. Financial markets are
gaining “new confidence” in Spain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
