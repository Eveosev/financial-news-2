Hungarian state-owned development
bank  Magyar Fejlesztesi Bank Zrt.  will extend loans to financial
institutions, according to a government directive published in
the Official Gazette.  MFB will give loans of as much as 50 billion forint ($227
million) to banks -- including via bond purchases -- in forint
or euros for a maturity of as long as 15 years, according to the
directive that was e-mailed today.  The measure aims to “boost the output of the Hungarian
economy through the participation of financial institutions,”
the text said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
