Canadian natural gas rose, reversing
earlier losses, as producers pledged to cut output to pare a
glut of the fuel in storage.  Alberta  gas gained 1.2 percent after  Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s
biggest gas producer, said it’s looking for a partner to help
fund drilling for oil and gas liquids. The Calgary-based company
said in February it would shift the majority of this year’s
spending to oil and liquids, joining U.S. producers including
Chesapeake Energy Corp. in curtailing gas exploration.  “The horizontal gas rig count has declined about 34
percent from its mid-October peak,” said Stephen Smith, an
energy analyst and president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates
in Natchez, Mississippi. The cuts are “likely to result in
lower-than-current production capacity by the second half of
this quarter,” he said.  Alberta gas for May delivery rose 2 cents to C$1.7075 a
gigajoule ($1.64 per million British thermal units) as of 3:25
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 41 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 2.6 cents to settle at $2.152 per million Btu.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago gained
4.92 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $1.9808 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 4.9 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $1.8705 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, gas slipped 2.97 cents to $1.9375.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 17.1 billion cubic
feet, 248 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.91 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.1 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 878 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.78 billion cubic feet today, or 67 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.08
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
