The trading arm of  De Beers , the
world’s largest diamond producer by value, named  Tiffany & Co. (TIF) 
unit Laurelton Diamonds, Pluczenik Diamond Co NV and  Suashish
Diamonds Ltd. (SAD)  among the 75 companies it selected to sell rough
diamonds for the next three years.  Diamond Trading Co., the London-based company moving its
sorting and trading to Botswana by late 2013, increased the
number of buyers with operations in Botswana to 21 from the 16
that qualified during 2008 to 2011, according to DTC’s  website .  De Beers’ trading arm holds 10 auctions a year, attended by
prequalified buyers, or sightholders, that buy rough diamonds
produced at De Beers’ mines in  South Africa , Botswana and
elsewhere. Sales of unpolished and uncut diamonds by DTC rose to
$6.5 billion last year from $5.1 billion a year earlier.  Steinmetz Diamond Group’s Diacor International Ltd.,
 Israel ’s Leo Schachter Diamonds Ltd. and Mumbai-listed Shrenuj &
Co. Ltd. are also buyers, according to the website.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  plans to take control of the diamond
producer in a $5.1 billion deal to boost its stake to as much as
85 percent from 45 percent. De Beers, which gets about two-
thirds of its output from Botswana, produced 31.3 million carats
of the gems last year. A carat is equal to a fifth of a gram.  To contact the reporter on this story:
