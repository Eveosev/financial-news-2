Luxembourg confirmed five new cases
of Schmallenberg livestock virus, all on cattle farms, lifting
the number of sheep and cattle holdings where the disease was
found in the country to 12, the Paris-based World Organization
for  Animal Health , or OIE, wrote in an  alert  on its website
today.  The virus, named after the German town where it was first
identified in November, causes stillbirths and deformed
offspring in sheep and cattle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
