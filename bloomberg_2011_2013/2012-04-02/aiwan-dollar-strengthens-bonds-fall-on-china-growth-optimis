Taiwan ’s dollar rose to a one-month
high after better-than-expected Chinese manufacturing data
spurred optimism growth in  Asia ’s largest economy remains
intact.  Bonds (GVTWTO5)  fell by the most in more than two weeks.  A purchasing managers’ index advanced to a one-year high of
53.1 in March, official data showed yesterday, compared with the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg for a
reading of 50.8. The island ships around 30 percent of its
products to China, according to trade ministry data. Taiwan’s
 consumer-price index  increased 1.27 percent in March from a year
earlier, after a 0.25 percent gain the previous month, according
to a Bloomberg survey before data due April 5.  “ China ’s manufacturing data boosted risk sentiment
today,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at
Cathay United Bank Co. “Rising  oil prices  are posing a threat
to consumer prices.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.506
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$29.380 earlier, the strongest level in a month. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings that
traders use to price options, was little changed at 4 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.02
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the
biggest increase for benchmark five-year rates since March 15.  Taiwan’s central bank left the benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 1.875 percent on March 22 and said it will focus on
inflation rather than boosting growth in 2012.  “Traders are speculating maybe the central bank will have
to do something later this year,” Lee said.  The overnight  money-market  increased one basis point to
0.425 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
