NYSE Euronext (NYX) , meeting with
investors for the first time after regulators rejected its
takeover by  Deutsche Boerse  AG, reduced its 2012 cost forecast,
pledged $250 million in annual savings by the end of 2014 and
said a stock buyback will be completed this year.  The  exchange  said 2012 costs will be $1.627 billion to
$1.652 billion, compared with a prior forecast of less than
$1.666 million, according to a presentation today. The company
also said “Project 14,” a program aimed at generating more
savings, will generate about $90 million from technology and
“organizational efficiency.” The New York-based firm is buying
back $550 million in shares.  NYSE Euronext, operator of the New York Stock Exchange,
bourses in Paris, Lisbon, Brussels and Amsterdam, and London-
based Liffe,  Europe ’s second-largest derivatives market, is
discussing its standalone strategy with shareholders after a
year’s work on a merger with Deutsche Boerse.  Last week, NYSE said it plans to spend $85 million moving
clearing for  London  derivatives trades to its own clearinghouse,
while retaining the services of LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. for cash
equities transactions.  NYSE Liffe Clearing, a central counterparty to all trades
on the London-based Liffe futures market, will be operational by
the summer of 2013. It will shift clearing for derivatives
traded in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris to the U.K.
capital in the first quarter of 2014. The company previously
said it would build two clearinghouses: one in London and one in
Paris.  NYSE Euronext said today that 2012  capital expenditures 
will increase to about $200 million from $170 million in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
