Italian and Spanish banks may get a
revenue boost of as much as 11 billion euros ($14.7 billion)
over three years as they increase government debt holdings as
part of European Central Bank refinancing, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said.  Spanish and Italian banks acquired more than 104 billion
euros of notes from their own countries between December and
February after tapping the first three-year refinancing from the
ECB, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Jernej Omahen estimated in a
note today. “Ample additional liquidity should result in
continued sovereign-bond purchases” through the first half
after the ECB provided a second set of funds at the end of
February, the analysts wrote.  French and German banks maintained “flat” holdings of
Italian and Spanish bonds, the analysts said. Spanish and
Italian banks have probably reaped 22 billion euros in  capital
gains  on bonds from their own countries, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
