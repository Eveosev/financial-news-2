President James Bullard said global economic strength could fuel
unexpectedly high inflation in the U.S.  “The Fed is charged with controlling U.S. inflation, but
possibly global inflation will drive U.S. prices higher or cause
other problems,” Bullard said in a speech in Beijing.  Bullard delivered the remarks March 28 at an event that was
closed to press coverage. The St. Louis Fed released excerpts
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
