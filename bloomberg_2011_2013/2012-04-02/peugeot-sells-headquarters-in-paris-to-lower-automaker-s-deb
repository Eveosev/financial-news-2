     April 2 (Bloomberg) -- PSA Peugeot Citroen,  Europe ’s second
biggest carmaker, signed an agreement to sell its 48-year-old
headquarters in Paris as part of a broader effort to raise cash
and decrease its growing debt pile.  The office, located about 700 meters (765 yards) from the
Arc de Triomphe and the Avenue des Champs-Elysees, will be sold
for 245.5 million euros ($327 million) to Ivanhoe Cambridge, the
real estate arm of Caisse de depot et placement du  Quebec , the
Paris-based carmaker said in an e-mailed statement today.  The 50,900-square-meter (548,000-square-foot) building, has
about 1,900 staff members, mainly working for the corporate
holding PSA and the Peugeot unit. The French carmaker will lease
back the building for at least nine years, the company said in
the statement.  Peugeot in February announced plans to sell assets after
net debt more than doubled in the second half to 3.4 billion
euros. Peugeot last week also completed a 1 billion-euro share
sale through which General Motors Co. took a 7 percent stake in
the French automaker as part of an alliance between the two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
