Ethanol rose to the highest price in
more than a week in  Chicago  on signs of higher production costs
and a stronger economy.  Futures gained for a second session after an Agriculture
Department report last week showed stockpiles of corn, the
primary feedstock in ethanol manufacture in the U.S., fell 7.9
percent March 1 to 6.009 billion bushels, the lowest for that
date since 2004. Another report showed manufacturing climbed.  “We’re absolutely flying high,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader
at PFG Best in Chicago. “It was a bullish stocks report. That’s
going to be somewhat supportive to ethanol as well.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery advanced 2 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.285 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since March 23. The futures have climbed 3.7
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago increased 6.5
cents, or 3 percent, to $2.26 a gallon and on the West Coast the
biofuel climbed 4 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.38, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf gained 3.5 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $2.31 a gallon and in  New York  the additive jumped 8 cents,
or 3.5 percent, to $2.345.  Corn futures for May delivery advanced 11 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $6.55 a bushel. On March 30, the price surged by the
exchange limit of 40 cents, or 6.6 percent, the most in 21
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
