U.S. stocks rose, sending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  to its highest level since December
2007, on stronger-than-forecast growth in manufacturing.  All 10 groups in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced.
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  and  Alpha Natural Resources
Inc. (ANR)  added more than 1.7 percent, pacing gains among  commodity
shares . Financial companies rose as  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  climbed at least 0.9 percent.  Avon Products Inc. (AVP) 
jumped 17 percent after Coty Inc. sought to acquire the door-to-
door cosmetics seller.  The S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent to 1,419.04 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The index on March 30 completed its biggest first-quarter
rally since 1998. The Dow gained 52.45 points, or 0.4 percent,
to 13,264.49 today. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, 3.6 percent below the three-month average.  “We have solid gains that are likely to be sustained,
maybe with some slight pullbacks over coming months,” Eric Teal, Raleigh, North Carolina-based chief investment officer at
First Citizens Bancshares Inc., which oversees $4.5 billion,
said in a telephone interview. “The manufacturing data continue
to show signs of improvement. It supports our modest pro-
cyclical position.”  Equities gained as manufacturing in the U.S. expanded at a
faster pace than forecast in March, a sign that the industry is
weathering slower global growth. The Institute for Supply
Management’s factory  index  rose to 53.4 from 52.4 a month
earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s data showed. Fifty is
the dividing line between growth and contraction. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected the gauge would climb to
53.  Construction Spending  A separate report showed construction spending decreased
1.1 percent in February, compared with the median economist
forecast for growth of 0.6 percent.  The  S&P 500   rose 12 percent  in the first quarter as
economic data surpassed estimates and investors speculated that
the euro area would contain its sovereign-debt crisis. The
benchmark measure advanced 3.1 percent in March, its fourth-
straight monthly increase for the gauge’s longest streak of
monthly gains since 2009, as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said he will keep stimulating the economy and  Europe 
agreed to increase rescue funds.  “We don’t see any big negatives that would cause people to
run for the hills,”  Joseph Keating , who helps oversee $1
billion as chief investment officer at CenterState Wealth
Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said in a telephone
interview. “Easy monetary policies are in place around the
globe. Investor sentiment has picked up.”  Commodity Producers, Banks  Commodity shares rose the most among  10 groups  in the S&P
500 after a gauge of manufacturing in  China  signaled stronger
demand. A Purchasing Managers’ Index touched a one-year high of
53.1 last month, China’s logistics federation and the National
Bureau of Statistics said. Readings above 50 signal growth.  Freeport-McMoRan jumped 2.8 percent to $39.11.  Alpha
Natural , a coal producer, rallied 1.7 percent to $15.47.  Alcoa
Inc. (AA)  added 1.5 percent, the most in the Dow, to $10.17, while
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  increased 1 percent to $108.30.  Investors snapped up shares of companies most tied to the
economy. The  Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC)  rallied 0.8 percent.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average, a proxy for economic
growth, climbed 1 percent.  Financial shares advanced 0.8 percent as a group in the S&P
500. Bank of America added 1.2 percent to $9.68, while Morgan
Stanley increased 0.9 percent to $19.81.  Non-Binding Proposal  Avon surged 17 percent, the most since July 2008, to
$22.70. Coty said it has submitted a non-binding proposal to
acquire the door-to-door cosmetics seller for $23.25 a share in
cash. The purchase price represents a premium of about 27
percent over the three-month average weighted price for Avon
shares, Coty said.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  advanced 3.2 percent to $618.63 after its new
iPad was named the best tablet computer in a ranking. Consumer
Reports said on its website that the new iPad’s high-resolution
screen provides the best detail and color accuracy of all
tablets it has seen, two weeks after the magazine said the
device runs “significantly hotter” than previous models.  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG)  rose 4.1 percent,
the third-biggest gain in the S&P 500, to $21.95. The insurer
being pressured by investor  John Paulson  to break up said it
will pay about $2.43 billion to buy back debt and warrants
issued to Allianz SE.  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF)  climbed 4.1 percent to $51.62, the
most since Feb. 15. The teen-clothing retailer was raised to buy
from hold at Brean Murray Carret & Co.  ‘Material Weakness’  Groupon Inc. tumbled 17 percent to $15.28 after the largest
provider of daily deals online reported a “material weakness”
in its financial controls and said fourth-quarter revenue was
lower than it had stated because of higher refunds to merchants.  The S&P’s first-quarter rally sent U.S. stocks above gold
by the most in more than a decade, a sign of growing investor
confidence in corporate profits as analysts raise earnings
estimates for the first time this year.  The S&P 500’s rise of 12 percent was 5.3 percentage points
more than gold for the widest gap to start a year since 1999,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  S&P GSCI Total
Return Index (SPGSCITR)  of 24 commodities gained 5.9 percent over the three
months, while Treasuries slipped 1.3 percent, trailing equities
by the most since 2009. Corporate bonds increased 2.4 percent
and the  dollar  fell 1.6 percent.  Gaining Traction  Stocks are diverging from defensive investments such as
gold as appetite for risk increases. While bulls see it as a
sign  profits  and the economy are gaining traction, bears point
to Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s warnings that more
stimulus may be needed as evidence that the rally has gone too
far. To money manager  Laszlo Birinyi , slower gains in precious
metals signal pessimism is starting to fade.  “The problem with gold now is that people are starting to
accept the economy recovery,” Birinyi, president of Westport,
Connecticut-based Birinyi Associates Inc., said in a March 29
phone interview. Even as confidence builds, “people are still
too focused on the concerns and the fact that this looks similar
to last year, where everyone said sell in May and go away,” he
said. “That’s exactly the kind of thing we look for.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
