Hurriyet Gazetecilik AS (HURGZ) , the
publisher of Turkey’s Hurriyet newspaper, dropped after
reporting a full-year loss that was almost quadruple analysts’
estimates.  The shares fell 1.7 percent to 1.16 liras by the close in
Istanbul after declining as much as 3.4 percent in intraday
trading.  Hurriyet’s loss widened to 235.7 million liras ($132
million) in 2011 from 40.1 million liras in 2010, it told the
 Istanbul Stock Exchange  on March 31. The company was forecast to
lose 62.1 million liras, according to the average of 10 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The worse-than expected net loss mainly stemmed from
higher-than-expected operational expenses at  Trader Media East
Ltd. (TME) ,” or TME, “and a goodwill impairment of 113 million
liras,” also mainly related to TME, Oyak Securities said in a
report today.  Hurriyet owns a 67 percent stake in TME, an Amsterdam-based
publisher of classified advertising in eastern European media.  To contact the reporter on this story:
