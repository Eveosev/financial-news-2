Polish manufacturing unexpectedly
increased in March from the previous month as rising output by
companies outweighed a decline in orders and job cuts.  The purchasing managers’ index, a gauge of manufacturing,
rose to 50.1 from 50 in February,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  said in an
e-mailed statement summarizing the results of a survey by  Markit
Economics . The median estimate of 21 economists in a Bloomberg
survey was 49.7. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a
figure below 50 shows a contraction.  Poland’s economy, set to grow at the fastest pace this year
among the European Union’s 27 members, is slowing  as austerity
measures curb growth the euro area, its main export market.
Manufacturing has been in “stagnation” since January’s 52.2
reading on PMI broke two months of contraction, HSBC said.  “The PMI is marginally disappointing and fits with
expectations of slowing growth in 2012,”  Agata Urbanska , a
London-based economist at HSBC, said in an e-mailed statement.
“It underscores that the stronger January reading was more of
an outlier and that the near-term outlook is for stagnation.”  The zloty weakened to 4.1412 per euro as of 10:46 a.m. in
Warsaw from 4.1405 before the PMI release and was 0.2 percent
stronger from March 30. It has gained 7.8 percent this year, the
best performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  New export orders were flat in March as the EU’s debt
crisis creates “tough and unstable” conditions, according to
the statement.  Economic expansion will slow to 2.5 percent this year from
4.3 percent in 2011, according to the European Commission, the
EU’s executive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
