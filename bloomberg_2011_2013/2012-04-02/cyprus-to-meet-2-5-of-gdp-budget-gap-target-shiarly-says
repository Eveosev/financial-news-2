Cyprus’s finance minister Vassos
Shiarly said that the east Mediterranean island’s fiscal deficit
this year will range between 2.5 percent and 2.7 percent of
gross domestic product.  The commitment given to the Eurogroup, the euro area’s
finance ministers body, by his predecessor Kikis Kazamias “will
be adhered,” Shiarly told lawmakers in Nicosia today. “We will
take all necessary measures to stay within this target should
there be any deviation. In 2013, the deficit will be 0.5 percent
of GDP which means we are close to a balanced budget”.  Shiarly, an ex Bank of Cyprus executive, said that the euro
area’s third smallest economy will prepare within “a few weeks
time” a bill to enshrine in its legislation the provisions of
the euro area’s fiscal compact which European leaders signed on
March 2, which aims at eliminating fiscal deficits.  Cyprus, which had a fiscal deficit of 6 percent of GDP in
2011 and is shut out of markets since May on rising borrowing
costs, will not run out of liquidity after it signed a 2.5
billion euros ($3.3 billion) loan with  Russia , the finance
minister said.  -- Editor: Tim Farrand  To contact the reporter on this story:
