For BlackBerry fans, these are dark
days.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  is losing market share to  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  New Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins
has even said he would consider a sale or partnership. That has
BlackBerry devotees fretting over their favorite phone’s future.  Like fans of many iconic products, BlackBerry loyalists
love the design of their phone. They praise its fast messaging
features and, perhaps most of all, the tactile pleasure of
typing on a real keyboard. BlackBerry loyalists, from high-
powered CEOs to freelance artists and students, come from all
walks of life. They all have one thing in common: They can’t
imagine a world without BlackBerrys.  “As long as I stay involved in this type of job, I’ll need
a BlackBerry,” said John Yester, who has been a firefighter
outside Pittsburgh for the past 15 years.  Yester, 31, started using his BlackBerry’s instant-
messaging service three years ago to coordinate with fellow
firefighters when responding to emergencies. He likes that it’s
fast, with a notification system, and easy, with a physical
keyboard.  “BlackBerry is reliable in my line of work, especially
with the dispatch center and in any emergency,” Yester said.
“I tried Android last year and the e-mail capabilities were
actually very frustrating. I switched back.”  BlackBerry phones aren’t likely to go the way of the Palm
Treo, Kodachrome film, or Saab cars anytime too soon.  Growth Overseas  Fortunately for RIM, there are more than 75 million others
out there like Yester, including U.S. President  Barack Obama  and
Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez .  While Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM’s BlackBerry has lost its
top spot in  Canada  and U.S. to the iPhone, it continues to grow
in  emerging markets . The company still has seen its  stock  slide
74 percent in 12 months, and the challenge for CEO Heins is to
recover the magic in  North America  before it’s too late.  RIM slipped 2.2 percent to $14.37 at the close in New York.  Kevin Michaluk, who founded fan site  Crackberry.com  after
“crackberry” became Webster’s 2006 word of the year, says
traffic has stayed level as international users replace those in
the U.S. RIM outshipped Apple by a margin of more than 3-to-1 in
the Middle East and  Africa  last year and BlackBerry outsold
iPhone in Latin America 5-to-1, according to research firm IDC.  Michaluk said he likes that a BlackBerry allows him to be
more efficient, by emphasizing fast messaging, as opposed to
helping him waste time with games.  ‘Priorities’  “People’s priorities are so messed up because if they
actually knew the BlackBerry experience and how much faster it
is, they wouldn’t use the other phones,” he said.  That’s all that Michael Hayes, a 32-year-old investor, says
he needs. As he works from home in Tampa,  Florida , he can step
outside and run errands, staying connected to work to the extent
that he has calluses on the hand where his phone sits. His
girlfriend makes fun of him.  “I don’t use my phone to play Draw Something or Angry
Birds or anything,” he said, referring to the games that take
advantage of touch screens on iPhone and Android phones. “If
I’m doing something, it’s pretty important.”  Some customers are hanging on for BlackBerry Messenger, a
system that comes loaded on the devices which allows any two
people to communicate instantly for free. Clyde Berry, a 45-
year-old music producer in Fall River,  Massachusetts , uses the
service to communicate with all his clients. You couldn’t pay
him to give up his 2007 BlackBerry Curve in exchange for a new
iPhone, he said.  Mobile Romance  “I’m able to keep in contact faster with clients, and we
can actually have real conversation,” said Berry, who describes
himself as a “crackberry addict” in his Twitter profile. “I
also use the password protector a lot and keep a lot of personal
and confidential information.”  BlackBerry continues to thrive  overseas . In  Saudi Arabia ,
teenagers have embraced RIM because they can flirt using its
encrypted and free BlackBerry Messenger, which allows them to
avoid local religious police who restrict interaction between
unmarried men and women.  In  Venezuela , where the device is ubiquitous on the streets
of Caracas, President Chavez has dubbed his BlackBerry and
Twitter account his “secret weapon.”  RIM is also popular in  Indonesia , where the company is
planning to add 4,000 retail stores, kiosks and other outlets to
keep up with demand. Rioting broke out at a November event in
Jakarta, sending 10 people to the hospital, when a promotion for
RIM’s latest BlackBerry Bold phone ran out of devices.  RIM could still make a comeback in the U.S. market, its
loyal fans insist, especially with the planned release later
this year of BlackBerry 10, a new feature-rich operating system.  “BlackBerry has a strong brand,” Michaluk said. “America
loves a comeback story. And if RIM can pull together the
BlackBerry 10 story, people will buy it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
