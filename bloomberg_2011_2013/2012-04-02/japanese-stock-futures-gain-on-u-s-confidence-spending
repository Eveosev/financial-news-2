Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average closing higher for the first time in
four days, as stronger-than-forecast U.S. consumer sentiment and
spending bolstered optimism on the global economic recovery.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets almost half of its
revenue in  North America , advanced 2.1 percent. Fanuc Corp., a
producer of robotics for mainland factories, gained 2 percent on
stronger Chinese manufacturing data.  NGK Insulators Ltd. (5333)  sank
8.8 percent after saying it may not be able to supply batteries
for a regional utility’s power plant.  “The  U.S. economy  is moving toward a recovery, boosting
expectations  Japan  will follow,” said Koichi Kurose, chief
economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd. “Investors are buying
shares, looking on the bright side of Chinese data.”  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 percent to 10,109.87 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, with volume 7.6 percent lower than the 30-day
average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index added 0.2 percent to 856.05,
paring gains in the final minutes of trading after rising as
much as 1 percent as the Bank of Japan’s Tankan survey showed
companies are skeptical the yen will continue to depreciate.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.2 percent
today. The gauge gained 0.4 percent in  New York  on March 30
after a report showed U.S.  consumer sentiment  climbed to the
highest since February 2011, boosting prospects for exporters.
Americans increased spending by the most in seven months,
according to a separate report from the U.S. Commerce Department.  Honda rose 2.1 percent to 3,210 yen. Canon Inc., the
world’s biggest camera maker, climbed 2.1 percent to 3,990 yen.
The stock also got rose after its target price was raised to
4,300 yen from 4,000 yen by  Barclays Capital .  China Manufacturing  The yen weakened after better-than-expected Chinese
manufacturing data boosted confidence in the global economy. A
Purchasing Managers’  Index (CPMINDX)  rose to a one-year high in March, the
National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday. A similar gauge
from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics fell to a four-month
low, with HSBC saying the government-backed PMI was skewed to
large enterprises and usually gained after the Lunar New Year.  Fanuc (6954)  gained 2 percent to 14,970 yen. TDK Corp., a
manufacturer of electronic parts which gets almost a third of
its revenue from  China , climbed 2.4 percent to 4,800 yen.  The yen depreciated to as low as 83.30 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 81.93 at the close of  stock
trading  on March 30. Japan’s currency weakened to 111.14 against
the euro from 109.38. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Tankan Index  Stocks pared gains in the final minutes after a note from
Jeffries Japan Ltd. said the Bank of Japan hasn’t done enough to
bolster business confidence. Today’s  Tankan survey  showed that
executives expect the sentiment index to remain negative at
minus 3 in June and the yen to strengthen about 6 percent from
today’s level to average 78.14 per dollar this fiscal year.  The  Topix (TPX)  has risen 8.8 percent since Feb. 14, when the
 Bank of Japan  extended its government-bond purchases, weakening
the yen. The gain has boosted the  value  of stocks on the Topix
to 1.05 times book value, up from 0.88 in December, according to
Bloomberg data. A number below one means companies can be bought
for less than value of their assets.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest lender
by market value, jumped 3.4 percent to 426 yen, the most-active
stock by value in Japan. The lender is considering spending
“several billion” dollars to buy a U.S. regional bank,
incoming bank unit President Nobuyuki Hirano said.  The lender is searching for targets mainly on the West
Coast to expand its commercial operations, said Hirano, who
became head of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. yesterday.  Shippers Gain  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., Japan’s third-largest shipping
line by revenue, gained the most in the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , jumping 6
percent to 193 yen after a measure of commodity-shipping rates
gained on higher grain exports from  South America . Mitsui O.S.K.
Lines Ltd., the No. 2, rose 2.5 percent to 369 yen, while Nippon
Yusen K.K., the largest, jumped 3.1 percent to 268 yen.  NGK Insulators declined the most on the Nikkei 225,
plunging 8.8 percent to 1,077 yen after saying Tohoku Electric
Power Co. is reviewing a plan to install NGK Insulators’
batteries at the utility’s Noshiro power plant. Tohoku Electric
slipped 1 percent to 935 yen.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility  Index (VNKY) , a measure of
Japanese option prices, slid 2.5 percent to 18.94 today,
suggesting a possible 5.4 percent swing in the Nikkei 225 in the
next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
