Oil rose the most in almost six
weeks after a report showed that manufacturing in the U.S.
expanded at a faster pace than forecast, signaling economic
growth in the world’s biggest crude-consuming country.  Futures climbed 2.1 percent as the Institute for Supply
Management’s  factory index  increased to 53.4 last month from
52.4 in February, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s data showed.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a gain
to 53. Crude fell earlier after a report showed euro-region
manufacturing contracted.  “The ISM really renews confidence in the  U.S. economy  as
we enter the new quarter,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at
Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on
energy. “It looks like the U.S. economy will continue to grow
at a steady clip in the second quarter.”  Crude oil for May delivery rose $2.21 to settle at $105.23
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the biggest
gain since Feb. 21. Earlier, futures touched $102.06 a barrel,
the lowest intraday level since Feb. 16. Prices are up 6.5
percent this year.  Brent oil for May settlement climbed $2.55, or 2.1 percent,
to end the session at $125.43 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract’s
 premium  to New York-traded West Texas Intermediate crude widened
to $20.20 at the settle, the most since October. The spread
reached a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Forecasts for the U.S. ISM index ranged from 51.7 to 54.5
in a Bloomberg survey of 72 economists. The gauge averaged 55.2
in 2011 and 57.3 a year earlier.  The gain in  oil prices  accelerated as U.S. equities
increased. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 1 percent at
3:09 p.m. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities
climbed 1.7 percent.  New Quarter  “Equities are up, so oil is up,” said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.
“There’s probably a lot of fresh buying because of the kickoff
of the second quarter. Money managers are probably coming back
irrespective of the market fundamentals.”  Futures in New York dropped as much as 0.9 percent earlier
as London-based Markit Economics said euro-area manufacturing
declined for an eighth month in March. The European
 manufacturing gauge , based on a survey of purchasing managers,
fell to 47.7 from 49 in February, remaining below the 50 line
that divides expansion from contraction.  The U.S. was responsible for 21 percent of global oil
demand in 2010, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of
World Energy released in June. The 17 countries using the euro
accounted for about 12 percent of world use.  Oil reached $110.55 on March 1, the highest level since May
4, amid speculation that Western sanctions aimed at halting
 Iran’s nuclear program  will disrupt Middle East shipments.  Iranian Viewpoint  “The West thinks that Iran, like many other countries,
will surrender under pressure from the U.S., but this belief is
wrong,” Foreign Minister  Ali Akbar Salehi  said in an interview
with the official  Islamic Republic News Agency  published today.
“Sanctions create minor problems for us but we will continue on
our path.”  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said March 31 that
negotiations between  Iran  and the five permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council plus  Germany  are set to be held
on April 13 and 14 in Istanbul. The last talks of the kind were
held in Turkey in January 2011, and broke down without any
commitments to hold another round.  Futures dropped 3.6 percent last week, the biggest decline
since December, amid speculation that emergency reserves would
be released to lower prices. French Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  said March 29 that the prospects of an accord on tapping
strategic stockpiles are good.  French Reserves  France ’s Comite Professionnel des Stocks Strategiques
Petroliers said it hasn’t been asked to prepare for a release of
emergency oil reserves,  Platts reported , citing an official at
the agency.  The CPSSP, as the department that holds inventories at 100
locations throughout the country is known, hasn’t received
instructions on this from the government, Platts said, citing
Jean-Marc Tenneson, general delegate at the agency.  Iraq’s oil exports in March rose to the highest level since
1980, a year after former President  Saddam Hussein  came to
power,  Asim Jihad , an Oil Ministry spokesman, said yesterday in
an e-mailed statement. The Middle East country exported 71.83
million barrels, or 2.32 million barrels a day, in March, he
said.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 469,268
contracts as of 3:10 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 459,683
contracts on March 30, 29 percent below the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.55 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
