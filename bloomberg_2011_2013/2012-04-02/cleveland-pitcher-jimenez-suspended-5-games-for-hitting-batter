Pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez of the
Cleveland Indians received a five-game suspension and was fined
an undisclosed amount for intentionally throwing a pitch at
former teammate Troy Tulowitzki of the Colorado Rockies.  The sanctions were announced yesterday by  Major League
Baseball , a day after the incident occurred in a spring training
game. Indians Manager Manny Acta said Jimenez will appeal the
suspension.  Jimenez was traded from Colorado to Cleveland in July and
has said in recent weeks that he wasn’t happy with the way the
Rockies treated him last season. Tulowitzki recently criticized
Jimenez for his attitude last year.  X-rays on Tulowitzki’s elbow were negative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
