Winter crops in  Russia ’s main
breadbasket area should have satisfactory weather for
development in April, the Federal Hydrometeorological Center
 said  on its website.  Russia’s southern and North Caucasus federal districts
accounted for 35 percent of the country’s grain crop last year
after harvesting about 32.6 million metric tons jointly,
according to state statistics data. Weather conditions for
spring sowing “will be close to the multi-year average” in
Russia’s southern regions this month, the center said.  Rainfall in the North-Caucasus federal district will be in
the normal range and across Russia’s southern federal district
it will be 10 percent to 35 percent above the average this
month, the Federal Agency on Hydrometeorology and Environmental
Monitoring said in an e-mailed statement today.  Temperatures will be about normal, varying between 9.2
degrees Centigrade (48.56 Fahrenheit) and 12.1 degrees
Centigrade in the two districts this month, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
