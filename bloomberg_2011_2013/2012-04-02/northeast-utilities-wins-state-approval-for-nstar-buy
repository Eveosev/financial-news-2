Northeast Utilities (NU)  won approval
from Connecticut for its $5.04 billion takeover of Nstar,
leaving one remaining regulatory consent needed for the creation
of New England’s largest utility owner.  Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority voted
in favor of the acquisition at a meeting today in Hartford,
Albert Lara, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, said in a
telephone interview. The purchase of Boston-based Nstar was
announced in October 2010 and still needs approval from
Massachusetts regulators.  Northeast Utilities, based in Springfield, Massachusetts,
and run from Hartford, Connecticut, has asked Massachusetts
regulators to review the deal by April 4, Lara said. The company
said  last month  it expects to complete the purchase by April 16.  “We’re still reviewing today’s decision but it represents
a positive step toward the mid-April completion of our merger,”
Lara said in an e-mail.  Northeast Utilities fell 0.2 percent to $37.05 at the close
in  New York .  Nstar (NST)  decreased 0.2 percent to $48.53.  To contact the reporter on this story:
