Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened
after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  shut a fluid catalytic cracker for
maintenance at the McKee refinery in Texas.  The 55,000-barrel-a-day unit was taken offline over the
weekend for the work that’s expected to last five weeks,  Bill
Day , a Valero spokesman, said in an e-mail statement. It is the
plant’s only fluid catalytic cracker, he said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  narrowed 0.88 cent to 10.5 cents under New York
Mercantile Exchange futures at 1:39 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 5.75 cents to
$3.2519 a gallon.  Reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, strengthened
0.12 cent to a premium of 6.5 cents a gallon.  Valero will shut a fluid catalytic cracker for work at its
Houston refinery in September, said two people familiar with the
plans, who declined to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  The Houston refinery has a capacity of 145,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
