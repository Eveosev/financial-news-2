Sandhill Cranes gather in a cornfield near the Rowe Sanctuary, south of Gibbon, on Monday, Jan. 16, 2012. The cranes usually spend the winter further south in  Texas  and  Oklahoma  but due to drought conditions many cranes have been spending the winter in Kansas and Nebraska. In a typical winter, the Texas Gulf Coast is packed with tens of thousands of birds-- songbirds, waterfowl, catbirds, gnatcatchers, warblers and other migrants. But this year, an annual count done just before Christmas found the population had dropped steeply.
