Soybeans rose, extending a rally to
a six-month high, after the government said U.S. farmers intend
to plant  less  this year. Corn rose on shrinking inventories, and
wheat fell on beneficial weather for winter crops.  Farmers will sow 73.902 million acres with soybeans this
year, down 1.4 percent from 2011 and the lowest in five years,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on March 30 after
surveying farmers. Stockpiles of corn on March 1 fell 7.9
percent to 6.009 billion bushels, the lowest for the date since
2004, the agency said.  “Corn and soybeans continue to rise on tightening supply
outlooks,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in
 West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in telephone interview. “If the
U.S. has a weather problem for a third straight year, then
prices will be explosive this summer.”  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 1.9 percent to
$14.22875 a bushel at 10:17 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the oilseed touched $14.3375, the highest for a most-
active contract since Sept. 7. In the first quarter, the price
jumped 16 percent, the most since the end of 2010, after drought
reduced South American output.  Corn futures for May delivery advanced 1 percent to $6.5025
a bushel. On March 30, the price surged by the exchange limit of
40 cents, or 6.6 percent, the most in 21 months.  Corn futures for delivery in December, after the harvest,
fell 0.3 percent to $5.385 a bushel. The USDA said on March 30
that farmers intend to plant the most acres in 75 years.  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 1.4 percent to $6.515 a
bushel, the fourth drop in five sessions. The price climbed 1.2
percent in the first quarter.  Today, the USDA reported that exporters sold 120,000 metric
tons of soybeans to  China  for delivery before Aug. 31. Exporters
also sold 120,000 tons of soy-based livestock feed to unknown
destinations for delivery after Oct. 1.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
