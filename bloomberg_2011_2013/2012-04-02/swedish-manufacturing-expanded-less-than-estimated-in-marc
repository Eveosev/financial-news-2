Swedish manufacturing expanded less
than estimated in March as production contracted.  The  purchasing managersâ€™ index  fell to a seasonally
adjusted 50.2 in March from 50.3 the previous month, Stockholm-
based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  said today. A reading above 50 signals a
contraction. The  average estimate  of six economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for the index to rise to 51.4.  The Swedish central bank in February indicated it will keep
its main  interest rate  unchanged for a year after cutting it by
a quarter of a percentage point to ward off a recession as the
economy shrank last quarter.  The production sub-index fell to 48.6 from 51.9 while
orders rose to 50.5 from 49.5. The employment index rose to 49.5
from 48.3.  Swedish central bank Deputy Governor Karolina Ekholm last
week said data show the economy has bottomed.  Manufacturing
confidence (SWMILSA)  in the largest Nordic country, which relies on
exports for about half of its output, improved more than
forecast to the highest since July last month.  Consumer
confidence (SWECCI)  rose to a seven-month high after  retail sales  rose at
the fastest pace since April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
