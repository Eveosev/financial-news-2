U.S. officials, during a six-day
sweep, arrested more than 3,100 illegal immigrants who have been
convicted of crimes or failed to leave the country after being
ordered to do so.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and
Customs Enforcement division announced the results of its third
national “Cross Check” operation today in a statement.  “The results of this targeted enforcement operation
underscore ICE’s ongoing commitment and focus on the arrest and
removal of convicted criminal aliens and those that game our
nation’s immigration system,” said  John Morton , the agency’s
director, in the statement.  Those arrested include 2,834 people with convictions for
crimes including murder, drug trafficking and child abuse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
