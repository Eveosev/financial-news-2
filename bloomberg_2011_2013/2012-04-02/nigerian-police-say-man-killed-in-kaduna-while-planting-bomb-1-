A man was killed while trying to
plant a bomb on a petrol tanker in the north-central Nigerian
city of Kaduna yesterday, police spokesman Aminu Lawan said.  “The bomb exploded with the man and killed him; he is the
only person that died,” Lawan said by phone today from the
city.  Authorities in  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer, blame
Boko Haram, a militant Islamic group, for a surge of attacks
since 2009 against government buildings and security forces in
the mainly Muslim north and Abuja, the capital.  The group claimed responsibility for multiple blasts and
attacks in the city of Kano on Jan. 20 that killed at least 256
people, according to the Civil Rights Congress. In February, a
blast at a military checkpoint in Kaduna killed at least one
person.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation with more than 160
million people, is split between a mainly Muslim north and a
predominantly Christian south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
