UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
said Tokyo-based chief equity strategist Shoji Hirakawa has left
the firm along with three analysts covering electronics, media
and insurance companies.  Mariko Eguchi, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for the bank,
confirmed the departures. She declined to comment on the timing
of the moves or whether they were voluntary.  UBS, which took a $2.3 billion loss from unauthorized
trading last year, is among banks worldwide that are paring
operations to cope with Europe’s debt crisis and stricter
banking regulations. Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Ermotti  said
in November that he plans to cut 2,000 jobs in  investment
banking  by 2016 to help reduce risk and boost profit.  Fumihide Goto, an analyst covering makers of electronic
parts, Shinsuke Iwasa, who covered media stocks, and Aya Fujiki,
an insurance company analyst, have also left the company, Eguchi
said. Attempts to contact the former UBS employees at their work
phone numbers were unsuccessful.  Hirakawa, who started at Zurich-based UBS in 2002 according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, was ranked  Japan ’s fifth-best
equity strategist last month by Nikkei Veritas magazine. Goto
was the No. 2 analyst for the electronic-parts sector.  The bank’s Tokyo-based team of equity analysts was ranked
second in Japan behind Nomura Holdings Inc. by the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
