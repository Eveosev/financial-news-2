European winter wheat losses from
frost damage may be 6 million metric tons, more than previously
expected, French farm adviser Agritel said.  Winter kill losses in  France  may be 2.2 million tons and
damage in Germany may cut soft-wheat production by 1.5 million
tons, with the remainder of losses elsewhere on the continent,
Paris-based Agritel wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Paris-traded milling wheat for November delivery rose above
grain for December delivery in  Chicago  for the first time in the
contracts’ lifetime on Feb. 7. Buyers now need to pay about
$274.46 a ton for French wheat, $16.91 a ton more than for soft
red winter wheat.  “The damages from freezing in  Europe , following the month
of February, seem to be higher than the first estimates by the
operators,” Agritel wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
