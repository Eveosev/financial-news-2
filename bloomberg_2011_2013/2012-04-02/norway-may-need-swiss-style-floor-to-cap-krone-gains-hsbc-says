Norway ’s central may need to
establish a Swiss-style floor for the krone-euro exchange rate
as it has limited ability to cut  interest rates  further without
stoking imbalances, HSBC Holdings Plc said in a note.  “The growing financial imbalance will make it more
difficult to cut interest rates again, suggesting any future
excessive krone strength might require a different preventative
strategy, namely the introduction of a Swiss-esque floor” for
the euro-krone, HSBC said in a note to clients.   The Norwegian central bank last month cut rates for a
second time since December to avoid excessive gains in the
krone, after it last month touched a nine-year high.  The currency has risen about 1 percent in the past three
trading sessions, and was up 0.5 percent at 7.5535 per euro as
of 4:38 p.m. in Oslo.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
