Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
 Brazil ’s second-biggest airline by market share, dismissed 131
crew members after cutting 80 of its 900 daily flights,
according to an e-mailed statement.  Another statement on Brazil’s Airline Workers Union  website 
said Sao Paulo-based Gol dismissed 86 pilots and 45 flight
attendants.  “The measure ensures a flight crew size that’s in line
with the company’s operational needs,” according to the e-
mailed statement, which was sent by Gol’s press office. The
reduction in the number of flights aims to adapt the company to
a new market reality, the company said.  Gol said on March 27 that net income dropped 59 percent to
54.3 million reais ($29.6 million) in the fourth quarter after a
41 percent increase in costs and operating expenses, including a
30 percent increase in payroll expenses to 447.6 million reais.  Gol shares  fell  1.2 percent to 12.04 reais today at the
close of trading in  Sao Paulo . Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index
rose 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
