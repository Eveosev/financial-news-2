Greece  will require immigrants to
obtain health certificates before being granted work permits and
those with contagious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis
will be quarantined in medical facilities, Health Minister
Andreas Loverdos said.  HIV cases in areas of central Athens, where illegal
immigrants and intravenous drug users congregate, will probably
reach more than 500 cases this year compared with 250 last year
and 15 in 2010, Loverdos said at a press conference yesterday,
according to an e-mailed transcript from the ministry.  In the first three months of the year more than 100 cases
of HIV were recorded in the area, the minister said. Hundreds of
unlicensed brothels in Athens and other cities are leading to
the further spread of disease, the minister said.  Last week, Greece announced a plan to create 30 detention
centers across the country, each to house as many as 1,000
illegal immigrants. The first is likely to open this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
