Rosatom Corp., Russia’s state-run
nuclear holding, may buy a stake in the $24 billion Horizon
project to build atomic power stations in the U.K.,  Kommersant 
reported, citing an unidentified company official.  RWE AG (RWE)  and  EON AG (EOAN) , Germany’s biggest utilities, said March
29 that they won’t build reactors in the U.K. through their
Horizon Nuclear Power venture, threatening government plans to
wean the country off fossil fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
