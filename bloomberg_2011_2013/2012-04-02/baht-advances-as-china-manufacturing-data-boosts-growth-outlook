Thailand ’s baht rose for a second
day and  government bonds  dropped after Chinese manufacturing
data beat economists’ estimates, fueling optimism economic
growth in Asia remains intact.  China ’s purchasing managers’ index climbed to a one-year
high of 53.1 in March, official data showed yesterday, compared
with a median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey for
50.8. Thailand’s gross domestic product will increase by 5
percent to 6 percent this year, after rising 0.1 percent in 2011,
the finance ministry said on March 26. Global funds bought $237
million more local stocks than they sold last month, exchange
data show.  “China’s manufacturing data has relieved investors’
concern of a hard landing,” said  Frances Cheung , a strategist
at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . “Foreign funds should
continue to flow into Thailand.”  The baht climbed 0.1 percent to 30.82 per dollar as of 3:16
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched a three-day high of 30.74 earlier. The currency advanced
2.3 percent last quarter, the most since the three months
through September 2010. The baht’s one-month implied volatility,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
steady at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent government notes due June
2017 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.69
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
