German stocks advanced as U.S.
manufacturing expanded at a faster pace than forecast in March.  The benchmark DAX Index advanced 1.4 percent to 7,044.18 at
5:01 p.m. in  Frankfurt . The gauge rallied 18 percent in the
first quarter, its best start to a year since 1998, amid
optimism that the euro area’s leaders would contain their
region’s sovereign-debt crisis and as U.S. economic data topped
estimates. The broader HDAX Index added 1.4 percent today.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index climbed
to 53.4 last month from 52.4 in February, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s report showed today. Readings greater than 50
signal growth. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a gain to 53. Production accelerated to a three-month
high and a gauge of factory employment climbed to the highest
level since June.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
