Home prices  in  Australia ’s eight
capital cities rose 0.2 percent in March from February, led by
increases of 1.4 percent in Perth and 0.8 percent in Brisbane,
according to figures from RP Data and Rismark International.  Prices were unchanged across the nation’s eight capital
cities in the three months ended March 31, according to the RP
Data-Rismark  home value index . Hobart was the best performer
during the quarter, with prices jumping 7.3 percent, while
Adelaide fared the worst, with prices dropping 1.5 percent.  “While the housing market remains soft, the zero percent
change over the first quarter of 2012 demonstrates that it is
consolidating its position following the decline seen in
calendar year 2011,” Ben Skilbeck, managing director of
Rismark, said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
