Hungaryâ€™s public debt level dropped
to 80.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 from 81.4
percent in 2010, the central bank said.  The debt load fell by 266 billion forint ($1.2 billion) in
the fourth quarter from the third quarter as net repayments cut
the burden by 1 trillion forint, while the depreciation of the
forint increased it by 764 billion forint, the  Magyar Nemzeti
Bank  said in an e-mail today.  A 1 forint change in the exchange rate causes a 0.14
percentage point change in the public debt level, the central
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
