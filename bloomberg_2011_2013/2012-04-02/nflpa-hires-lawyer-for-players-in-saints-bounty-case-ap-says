The National Football League Players
Association hired a lawyer to represent any players who might
face criminal charges as a result of the  New Orleans Saints ’
bounty program, the Associated Press reported.  The NFLPA has told the players involved that they could
face charges, AP said, citing two people familiar with the
situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the
investigation is continuing. Union officials have suggested that
players should have a lawyer and NFLPA representative with them
when they meet with NFL investigators, AP said. The NFLPA plans
to meet with the league’s security staff this week in  New York 
to review evidence in the case, AP added.  Twenty-two to 27 Saints defensive players paid each other
as much as $10,000 for targeting opponents such as Super Bowl-
winning quarterbacks  Kurt Warner  and  Brett Favre  for injury from
2009 to 2011, the NFL said last month in handing down a one-year
suspension to coach Sean Payton and eight-game ban for Saints
General Manager Mickey Loomis.  Payton and Loomis will meet with NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  tomorrow to appeal their suspensions,  ESPN reported ,
without saying where it got the information. The Saints
confirmed last week that Payton and Loomis planned to appeal the
discipline, the stiffest ever imposed on an NFL team and its
leadership. Goodell is now determining how to punish the players
who were involved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
