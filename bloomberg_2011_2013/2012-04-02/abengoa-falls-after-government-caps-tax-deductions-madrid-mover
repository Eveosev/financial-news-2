Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish solar-power
plant developer, dropped the most in almost two years after the
government capped tax deductions on financial costs.  Abengoa fell as much as 10 percent, the biggest intraday
drop since May 2010, and was 5.5 percent down at 12.94 euros as
of 12:53 p.m. in Madrid. It was the worst performer on the
benchmark  IBEX 35 (IBEX)  Index today.  The Spanish government pledged last week the deepest budget
cuts in more than 30 years. As part of the measures, it will cap
tax deductions on financial costs to 30 percent of earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Previously,
companies could deduct financial costs without limits.  “This is negative news for companies with a high level of
debt, particularly for Abengoa,” Manuel Dias Coelho, an analyst
at Banco BPI in Porto, Portugal, said by phone today. “Then you
also need to take into account the great regulatory uncertainty
within the renewable energy market, which is also having a
negative impact.”  Spanish builders including  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  and wind-
energy companies such as  Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM)  also fell
in Madrid. Sacyr slid 3.5 percent to 2.20 euros and Gamesa lost
2.6 percent to 2.32 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
