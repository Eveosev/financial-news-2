Agrobanka AD (AGBN) , a Serbian bank that
was placed into receivership three months ago, reported a 29.7
billion-dinar ($355 million) loss last year.  That compares with a pretax profit of 1.18 billion dinars
for 2010. The financial statement showed zero capital and
accumulated losses of 17.6 billion dinars at the end of 2011,
according to an Agrobanka financial statement released by the
central bank today.  The lender’s assets shrank to 61.6 billion dinars from 74.4
billion dinars at the end of the previous year.  “Agrobanka seems to have written off a lot more claims
than realistically required,” said Nenad Gujanicic, chief
broker at Belgrade-based  Sinteza Invest Group AD  brokerage.
“The problem is that in its present shape, it will be
impossible to find a strategic partner for Agrobanka” while the
government has no money in its budget to boost the bank’s
capital, he said.  Serbia ’s central bank fired the management of Agrobanka on
Dec. 29 and placed it in receivership after inspectors
discovered its capital didn’t match the risk it had assumed with
its business. The bank, with a market share of less than 3
percent and ranked 12th among 33 banks operating in the Balkan
country, is 20 percent state-owned.  Deputy Finance Minister Goran Radosavljevic said a month
later that the bank would need at least 100 million euros ($133
million) to put it back to business.  Agrobanka closed 2.41 percent down today at 1,415 dinars
per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
