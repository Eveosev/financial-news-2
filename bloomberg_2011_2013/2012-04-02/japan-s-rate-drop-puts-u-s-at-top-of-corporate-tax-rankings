U.S. corporations are pointing to
the country’s new status as the major economy with the highest
statutory corporate  tax rate  as a reason for overhauling the tax
code and cutting the rate.  Japan  reduced its rate, effective this month, putting that
country’s statutory tax rate at 38.01 percent, according to the
 Tax Foundation , a Washington group that favors a broader tax
base and lower rates. The U.S. rate, including state and local
income taxes, is 39.2 percent.  “In terms of forcing the idea of lowering the corporate
tax rate as a vital part of U.S. economic strategy, we’re
encouraged,” said James Pinkerton, co-chairman of a  coalition 
of companies that support lower rates, including  CVS Caremark
Corp. (CVS)  and  Raytheon Co. (RTN)   Because of various tax breaks, the effective tax rate for
many U.S. companies is far below 35 percent, and many of the
breaks remain popular with companies and politicians.  U.S. lawmakers have been debating a corporate tax rate cut.
Last week,  House Republicans  adopted a budget that called for
dropping the federal rate to 25 percent from 35 percent. They
haven’t specified how they would broaden the tax base.  President Barack Obama, in a corporate tax framework
released in February, called for a 28 percent top rate and a 25
percent rate for manufacturers. The administration suggested
getting rid of many tax breaks and changing the tax treatment of
corporate interest expenses.  “We’re fully aware that there are tradeoffs involved in
this,” Pinkerton said. “Awareness is not the same as
enactment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
