BlackRock (BLK)  Inc. said Som Seif, who
founded and led the Canadian investment unit it agreed to buy in
January from Guggenheim Partners LLC, will leave the company
this month to pursue other opportunities.  Seif, 35, was president and chief executive officer of
Toronto-based Claymore Investments Inc., which managed $6.9
billion in exchange-traded and closed-end funds when BlackRock
made the deal. Mary Anne Wiley, who was named head of iShares
Canada following the announcement of the sale, which was
completed on March 7, will assume responsibility for the
Claymore business,  Brian Beades , a spokesman for New York-based
BlackRock, said today in an e-mailed statement.  BlackRock, which has pushed for more transparent labeling
of exchange-traded products to help investors identify risks,
said today it will liquidate a C$2.6 million ($2.6 million)
Canadian ETF because of its speculative nature. The fund was
designed to rise in value when an index linked to 10-year
Canadian  government bonds  fell.  Assets in the Claymore Inverse 10-Year Government Bond ETF
had fallen from C$4.9 million in the past 11 months. The fund
will be terminated by June 22 and the money returned to
investors, BlackRock said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
