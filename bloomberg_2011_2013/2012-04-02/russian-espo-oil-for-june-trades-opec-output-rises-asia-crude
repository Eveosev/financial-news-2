A cargo of  Russia ’s East Siberia
Pacific Ocean pipeline crude for June loading traded at the
biggest reported premium since April shipments sold last month.  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  paid about $4.60 to $4.90 a
barrel more than benchmark Dubai prices to  OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  for a
100,000-metric-ton cargo of so-called ESPO for loading May 30 to
June 2, according to two traders who participate in the market,
declining to be identified because the information is
confidential.  ESPO prices are linked to the monthly average of Dubai
crude as published by the Platts oil-pricing company. The
Rosneft cargo bought by Glencore was sold against June
assessments, the traders said.  The premium was the highest since  Japan ’s JX Nippon Oil &
Energy Corp. paid $5.40 a barrel above Dubai for an early-April
shipment, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rosneft also
sold a May 19 to May 22 ESPO cargo to  BP Plc (BP/) , according to two
traders. The price was not known.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will announce the official selling
prices for its crude in May by April 5. Saudi prices are used as

an average 31.22 million barrels a day from a revised 31.11
million in February, according to the survey of  oil companies ,

1980, a year after former President  Saddam Hussein  came to

now is  greater  than that for later, rose by 5 cents. Swaps for
