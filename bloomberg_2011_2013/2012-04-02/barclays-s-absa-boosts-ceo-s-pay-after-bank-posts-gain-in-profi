Absa Group Ltd., (ASA)  the South African
lender controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , increased Chief Executive
Officer Maria Ramos’s pay by 5.6 percent after profit rose in
2011 on higher income from consumer banking and lower costs.  Ramos’s total remuneration of 20.7 million rand ($2.7
million) included guaranteed pay of 6.66 million rand and
deferred awards valued at 14 million rand, according to the
Johannesburg-based bank’s  annual report  that was released on
March 30. The CEO received 19.6 million rand in 2010 and a one-
time “key leaders” award equivalent to 8 million rand.  Absa,  South Africa ’s largest retail bank, said on Feb. 10
that 2011 net income climbed 19 percent to 9.67 billion rand and
earnings per share excluding one-time items beat the median
estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. This year the
company is reorganizing to improve efficiency and integrate its
systems with Barclays, which may cause job losses. Since
September, six Absa executives including Chairman Garth Griffin,
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Louis von Zeuner and  consumer
banking  head Gavin Opperman have announced their resignations.  Von Zeuner, who has been with the bank for 32 years, is
eligible for a total termination payment of more than 14.5
million rand, according to the annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
