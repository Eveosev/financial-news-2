Aluminum traders probably added to
wagers on lower prices, or short positions, as the metal slid at
the same time that the number of outstanding contracts rebounded
from a seven-month low.  Open interest in London Metal Exchange aluminum futures
rose by 17,101 contracts to 1.21 million lots in the week ended
March 29, according to bourse figures. Aluminum for three-month
delivery, the benchmark contract, fell 1.5 percent in that
period. Each contract represents 25 metric tons of the
lightweight metal.  Higher open interest and lower prices suggest new short
positions, according to Sydney-based Macquarie Group Ltd. Open
interest declined to 1.18 million lots on March 21, the lowest
since Aug. 18.  Following are changes to market open interest for LME
members and clients compiled by the exchange for the six biggest
industrial-metals futures traded on the bourse in the week ended
March 29, along with price movements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
