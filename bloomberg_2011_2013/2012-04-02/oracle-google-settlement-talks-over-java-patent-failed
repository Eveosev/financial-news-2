Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  have
reached an “irreconcilable impasse” in settlement talks to
resolve an intellectual property dispute over the Java
programming language and their lawsuit should proceed to trial
on April 16, a judge said.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal in  San Jose ,  California ,
wrote in a filing today that no further settlement conferences
will be scheduled. Oracle accused Google in a 2010 lawsuit of
infringing patents related to its Java software in the company’s
Android mobile software. With a settlement, the companies avoid
the risk of a jury deciding whether Google owes royalties.  The case is Oracle America Inc. v. Google Inc., 10-03561,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California ( San
Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
