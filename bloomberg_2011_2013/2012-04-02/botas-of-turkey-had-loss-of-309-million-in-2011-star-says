Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS,
 Turkey ’s state-owned pipeline company which is known as Botas,
had a loss of 550 million liras ($309 million) in 2011 because
it subsidized domestic natural gas sales,  Star  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Rising oil and gas prices, depreciation of the lira and
Botas’s payment of $2.5 billion to  Russia  for contracted gas it
didn’t buy under the so-called take-or-pay liability were the
reasons for the loss, the Istanbul-based newspaper said. Botas
has sold gas in the domestic market at $50 less than the
purchase price per 1,000 cubic meters, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
