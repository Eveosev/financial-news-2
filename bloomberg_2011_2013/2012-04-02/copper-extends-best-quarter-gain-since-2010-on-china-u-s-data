Copper climbed, extending its
biggest quarterly gain since the end of 2010, on signs of
strengthening economic growth in  China  and the U.S., the world’s
two largest consumers of the metal.  Three-month copper rose as much as 1 percent to $8,530 a
metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange and traded at $8,492.25
by 3:56 p.m. Tokyo time. The metal advanced 11 percent in the
first quarter. May-delivery metal climbed 0.8 percent to $3.8565
a pound on Comex in  New York . Markets in China are closed for
holidays.  “Positive economic data from China and the U.S. boosted
 market sentiment  and copper prices,” said Hwang Il Doo, a
senior trader at  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  Futures Co. in  Seoul . A
decline in Shanghai stockpiles also helped, he said.  A Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to a one-year high of
53.1 last month, China’s logistics federation and the National
Bureau of Statistics said. Payrolls in the U.S. probably
increased in March for a fourth consecutive month, economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News said before an April 6 report from
the Labor Department. Employment rose by 205,000 after climbing
by 227,000 in February, the survey showed.  Copper in London rose 1.1 percent on March 30 after the
Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its business
barometer was at 62.2 in March. Readings greater than 50 signal
growth. U.S. consumer purchases rose 0.8 percent in February,
the Commerce Department said the same day.  Copper inventories in LME warehouses are down 31 percent
this year to 256,275 tons, according to exchange data. Orders to
draw copper from LME inventories fell 1.3 percent to 84,300 tons.  Stockpiles (SHFCCOPD)  of copper monitored by the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange fell 4,818 tons to 218,814 tons last week, declining
for a second week, according to a survey of 10 warehouses in
Shanghai, the exchange said March 30. Those at bonded warehouses
rose 900 tons to 19,681 tons.  On the LME, aluminum was unchanged at $2,125 a ton, zinc
was up 0.9 percent at $2,017.50 a ton and lead rose 0.3 percent
to $2,049 a ton. Tin increased 1.1 percent to $23,050 a ton and
nickel climbed 1.5 percent to $18,100 a ton.  To contact the reporter for this story:
