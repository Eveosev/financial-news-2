Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures rose the most in almost six weeks after a
report that manufacturing in the U.S. expanded at a faster pace
than forecast.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 24.52 percent as of 3:50 p.m. on the New
York Mercantile Exchange versus 24.87 percent March 30.  Crude for May delivery advanced $2.21, or 2.1 percent, to
settle at $105.23 a barrel on the Nymex after the Insitute for
Supply Managementâ€™s factory index climbed to 53.4 percent last
month from 52.4 in February. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey called for a gain to 53.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $100 puts, which fell 87 cents to $1.73 a barrel at 4:04
p.m. with 3,544 contracts trading. May $100 puts were the
second-most active with 3,429 lots changing hands. They fell 63
cent to 54 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 56 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish options accounted for 57 percent of the 104,500
trades March 30. May $110 calls were the most actively traded,
with 5,383 lots changing hands as they fell 1 cent to 33 cents a
barrel. The next-most active options, May $100 puts, declined 9
cents to $1.17 on volume of 4,854.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 45,662
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 38,578 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,927.  To contact the reporter on this story:
