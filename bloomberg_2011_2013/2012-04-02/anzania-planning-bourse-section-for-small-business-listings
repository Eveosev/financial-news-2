Tanzaniaâ€™s central bank is planning
to create a section on the Dar es Salaam-based stock exchange to
let small businesses raise capital and list shares.  The bank is seeking consultants to prepare the plan for the
capital markets regulator, which will start in the 2012-13
fiscal year, it said in a statement published in the Daily News
today. The plans also include trading of municipal bonds on the
bourse and setting up a commodities exchange, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
