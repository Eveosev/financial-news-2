Greece â€™s economy will contract
further this year as austerity measures curb domestic demand,
the Athens-based Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research
said.  The economy will shrink by about 5 percent after
contracting 6.8 percent in 2011, the foundation, also known as
 IOBE , said today in its latest quarterly  report  on the  Greek
economy .  Exports also may decline as growth and demand worldwide
falter and unemployment may reach around 20 percent after rising
in December to a record 21 percent and 51 percent among younger
people, the IOBE said in the e-mailed report.  Greece is now in its fifth year of recession. Austerity
measures adopted as part of a deal to obtain international
financial aid include property taxes paid through electricity
bills, an additional 12 percent cut in pensions and salaries for
state workers this year and a 22 percent reduction in the
minimum wage to 638 euros ($850) a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
