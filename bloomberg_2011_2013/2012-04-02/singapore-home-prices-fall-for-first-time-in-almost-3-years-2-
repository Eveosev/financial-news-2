Singapore  home prices fell for the
first time in almost three years after the government imposed
new taxes on house purchases.  The island state’s private residential property price index
declined 0.1 percent to 206 points in the quarter ended March 31
from the previous three months, according to flash estimates
released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority today. That’s the
first drop in prices since June 2009.  “The decline last quarter has been marginal, but it will
have a psychological impact on people,” Nicholas Mak, an
 executive director  at SLP International Property Consultants in
Singapore, said in a phone interview today. “The rate of
decline can increase this quarter but I don’t think it will
exceed 1 percent.”  Singapore has been attempting to rein in prices since 2009,
when it barred interest-only loans for some housing projects and
stopped allowing developers to absorb interest payments for
apartments still being built. Foreigners and corporate entities
have to pay an additional 10 percent stamp duty following
measures introduced in December.  The  FTSE Strait Times Real Estate Index (FSTRE)  fell 0.1 percent as
of 11:25 a.m. in Singapore trading. City Developments Ltd., the
city-state’s second-largest real-estate company, slid 1.1
percent to S$11.23, the first retreat in five days, and  Wing Tai
Holdings Ltd. (WINGT)  lost 1.2 percent to S$1.265.  Extra Levy  The extra levy is 3 percent for permanent residents
purchasing a second home and for citizens buying their third
residential property. The government earlier imposed a 1 percent
duty on the first S$180,000 ($142,879) of the property price, 2
percent on the next S$180,000 and 3 percent for the remainder.  In January 2011, the government also raised down-payment
requirements for second mortgages and extended the period
homeowners must hold their properties to avoid a sales
transaction tax to fend off speculators.  Still, home sales rebounded in February to the highest
since July 2009, boosted by purchases in suburban areas as some
developers offered incentives after the government curbs.
Private home sales rose to 2,413 units in February from 1,872
units in January, according to data from the  Urban Redevelopment
Authority .  Developers are increasing sales by offering smaller units,
according to CBRE Group Inc., the Los Angeles-based property
broker. The median size of units declined 24 percent to 667
square feet in the quarter ended March from the previous three
months while the median price slid 18 percent to S$786,340, it
said.  Developers sold about 5,200  apartments  in the past three
months, the highest since the quarter ended September 2009, CBRE
said in a statement on March 30.  “We are seeing good sales in the primary market as
developers are holding prices and not competing with each other
to cut prices,” Mak said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
