Slovenia’s central bank revised its
forecast for the country’s economy to a contraction from an
expansion for 2012, citing a weakening demand in  Europe .  Gross domestic product, the value of goods and services, is
expected to contract 1.2 percent this year before expanding 0.6
percent in 2013, Damjan Kozamernik, head of research at the
Slovenia central bank, told reporters in Ljubljana today. The
central bank’s October forecast had been an expansion of 1.7
percent for 2012 and 2.5 percent for next year.  “The biggest risk to the forecast of Slovenia is the
uncertainty over demand in euro region on which the country so
depends on,” Kozamernik said. “If euro region shrinking more
than foreseen, our GDP will contract more.”  GDP will probably accelerate to 1.7 percent in 2014, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
