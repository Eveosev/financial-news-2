The 15 percent of U.S. high school
seniors who abuse alcohol and drugs first began using them at
age 14 or 15, according to a study that’s one of the first to
track substance-abuse trajectories during this key period.  The finding, reported today in the  Archives of General
Psychiatry , suggests that prevention programs should begin early
in adolescence before problems arise, rather than when abuse
becomes obvious, said Joel Swendsen, the lead author.  Teenagers whose substance abuse caused problems socially,
in school or with the law, started drinking or doing drugs when
they were 14 or 15 years old, the research found. By the time
kids reach age 18, almost half consumed at least 12 drinks a
year and 15 percent were abusers, according to the report. About
43 percent of older teens used drugs at least once and 16
percent abused them, the study found.  “This is showing us that we should intervene well before
14 or 15 years old,” said  Swendsen , director of research at the
National Center for Scientific Research at the University of
Bordeaux,  France , by telephone. “The earlier you can intervene,
the bigger the payoff in terms of preventing these problems.”  The researchers re-analyzed data from a national face-to-
face  survey  of 10,123 adolescents ages 13 to 18 years in the
U.S., conducted between February 2001 and January 2004. Previous
reports from the earlier research only looked back a year on
student drug use, according to the researchers from the  National
Institutes of Health  in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The most-recent report found that white and Hispanic kids
were more likely than those of other racial groups to consume
alcohol or drugs. Boys were more likely than girls by the age of
17 or 18 to drink or do drugs, the study showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
