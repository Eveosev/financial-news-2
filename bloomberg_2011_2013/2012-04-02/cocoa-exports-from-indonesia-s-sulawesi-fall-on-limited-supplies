Cocoa-bean exports from  Indonesia ’s
Sulawesi island, the main growing areas of the world’s third-
biggest producer, fell for the third straight month due to
limited supplies ahead of the main harvest.  Overseas shipments from Central and South Sulawesi
provinces plunged 53 percent to 3,506 metric tons in March from
a month earlier, according to data released today by the
Indonesia Cocoa Association.  Falling shipments from the Southeast Asian country may help
to extend the 5 percent gain on the price of the chocolate
ingredient in New York this year, adding to concern that demand
may exceed supplies. The two provinces represent about 75
percent of bean exports and output from Indonesia.  “The harvest has already started in some areas, but only
in small quantities ahead of the main harvest, which will start
next month,” Dakhri Sanusi, secretary general of the trade
group, said by telephone from Makassar, South Sulawesi today.
“Exports will start to pick up in May but it’s unlikely to be a
huge jump as local demand is also high.”  Shipments in the first quarter plunged 66 percent from a
year earlier to 10,914 tons, association data showed.  May-delivery Cocoa futures fell 0.2 percent to $2,219 a ton
on the ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  on March 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
