Iraq  has asked Qatar to hand over
the country’s Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who is wanted on
terrorism charges and is now in Doha, according to Deputy Prime
Minister Hussain al-Shahristani.  Hashimi left Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region for
Qatar and is due to visit a number of unspecified countries
before returning to the Kurdish region, his office said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Qatari officials were not
immediately available for comment.  Hashimi left Baghdad for Erbil in the Kurdistan region
after an arrest warrant was issued against him. State-sponsored
Iraqiya television aired what it described as confessions by his
bodyguards saying that they were paid to carry out murders at
his request. Hashimi said the confessions were fabricated and
asked to be tried in Kurdistan.  Kurdish authorities should not have allowed Hashimi to
leave the country because he was named in an arrest warrant,
Shahristani said at a news conference in  Baghdad .  To contact the reporter on this story:
