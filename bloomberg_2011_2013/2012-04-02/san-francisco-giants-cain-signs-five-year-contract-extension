San Francisco  Giants pitcher  Matt Cain  signed a five-year contract extension that would keep him
with the club through the 2017 Major League Baseball season.  The contract also has an option year, the Giants said today
in a  news release  on their website. Financial terms weren’t
disclosed. The deal is worth $112.5 million over five years,
according to the San Francisco Chronicle, which would make it
the biggest long-term contract for a right-hander.  The agreement includes a no-trade clause and a club option
for 2018 that vests automatically for $21 million if Cain hits
an innings target in 2017, the Chronicle said.  Left-handers CC Sabathia of the  New York Yankees  and  Johan Santana  of the New York Mets are the only pitchers whose
contracts are worth more, according to ESPN. Sabathia signed a
$161 million contract from 2009 to 2015 and had an additional
year and $30 million in guaranteed money added last year, while
Santana has a $137.5 million deal that runs from 2008 to 2013,
ESPN said.  The previous record for a right-hander was the $105 million
the  Los Angeles Dodgers  gave Kevin Brown after the 1998 season,
ESPN said.  Cain, a two-time All-Star, went 12-11 last season with a
2.88 earned run average. Having played his entire seven-year
major league career in San Francisco, the 27-year-old is 69-73
with a 3.35 ERA. He has made more than 30 starts in each of his
six full seasons with the Giants.  Cain helped the Giants to the World Series title in 2010,
going 2-0 without allowing an earned run in three starts,
pitching 21 1/3 innings in the postseason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
