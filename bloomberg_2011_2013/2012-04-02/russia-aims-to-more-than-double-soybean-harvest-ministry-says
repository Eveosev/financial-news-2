Russia aims to more than double its
soybean harvest by 2020 to ensure the country has enough animal
feed for livestock, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  The government is targeting annual output of 3.75 million
metric tons, against last year’s 1.7 million tons, the ministry
said today in an e-mailed statement. Sowing of the oilseed is
planned to expand this year by 137,500 hectares (339,770 acres)
to 1.3 million hectares before reaching 1.5 million hectares in
2013 and 2.5 million hectares in 2020, it said.  The increase will help “to secure protein needs of
livestock breeding sector,” Agriculture Minister  Yelena
Skrynnik  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
