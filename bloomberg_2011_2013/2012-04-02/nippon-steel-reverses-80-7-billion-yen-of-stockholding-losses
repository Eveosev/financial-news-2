Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) ,  Japan ’s largest
steelmaker, reversed 80.7 billion yen ($975 million) of losses
last quarter after the stock market recovery increased the value
of its holdings.  The loss in the valuation of securities held by the company
narrowed to 3.8 billion yen, Tokyo-based Nippon Steel said today
in a statement. It booked an 84.6 billion yen charge in the nine
months ended Dec. 31 to write down the value of shares it owns
in other companies.  The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index rose 19 percent in the
three months ended March 31, its biggest quarterly gain in more
than two years.  Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405) , Nippon Steel’s
largest investment and its merger partner, also advanced 19
percent in Tokyo trading last quarter.  Nippon Steel is compiling full-year earnings and will
announce its profit outlook later if necessary, according to the
statement. In January, the company forecast it would break even
for the full year, compared with a profit of 93.2 billion yen a
year earlier.  Nippon Steel  shares , which have gained 16 percent this
year, fell 1.8 percent to 233 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
