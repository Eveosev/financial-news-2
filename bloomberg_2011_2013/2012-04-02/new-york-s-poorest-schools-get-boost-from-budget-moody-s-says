New York (STONY1)  poorest schools will get a
boost from the $132.6 billion state budget passed last week as
education aid grows by 4 percent and districts work to stay
below the 2 percent tax cap, Moody’s Investors Service said.  The state deems about one-third of its 676 school districts
to be “high-need,” including the five biggest cities --  New
York ,  Buffalo, (9638MF)   Rochester (8387MF) ,  Syracuse (28446MF)  and  Yonkers (8332MF)  -- Moody’s said
in a report today. Those systems will collectively receive
almost half of the $805 million increase in school aid provided
for in the fiscal 2013 budget, Moody’s said.  “The budget’s passage is credit positive for less-affluent
school districts struggling to overcome constraints caused by
the state’s new 2 percent cap on annual increases in property
tax levies,” Moody’s said in the report.  The property-tax cap, approved by lawmakers in June, went
into effect Jan. 1. Most school districts in New York are
currently developing their budgets for the next fiscal year and
will submit them for voter approval as early as May.  About half of the aid increase is for general operations,
and 76 percent of that will go to schools in need, which the
state defines as those with high rates of poverty relative to
the district’s wealth, the report said.  Under the fiscal 2013 budget,  New York City  will receive
$292.1 million more than last year, raising its total aid to
$7.9 billion, Moody’s said. The state fiscal year began April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
