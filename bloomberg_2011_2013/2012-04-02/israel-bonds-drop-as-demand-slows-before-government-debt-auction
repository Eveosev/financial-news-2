Israel ’s bonds fell for the first
time in four days as demand for existing securities slowed
before the government sells 1.2 billion shekels ($323 million)
of debt at an auction today.  The yield on the most-traded 4.25 percent bonds due August
2016 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.58
percent, at 10:45 a.m. in Tel Aviv. The yield on the 5.5 percent
notes maturing in January 2022 increased two basis points to
4.70 percent, the highest level since March 22, after climbing
14 basis points last quarter.  The  finance ministry  will offer 250 million shekels each of
the 2016 and 2022 securities at today’s auction, according to
official data posted on Bloomberg. It plans to sell 250 million
shekels of inflation-linked bonds due May 2017. The government
is also issuing 2.75 percent consumer price-linked notes due
2022 and 2041.  “Yields are rising ahead of the offering as investors are
waiting to buy at the government bond auction,” said Effi Cohen, a bond trader at  Leader Capital Markets (LDRC)  Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  The one-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
Israel’s inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate notes of similar
maturity, rose two basis points to 293. That implies an average
annual inflation rate of 2.93 percent, near the higher end of
the central bank’s target range of 1 percent to 3 percent.  One-year interest-rate  swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for rates, advanced two basis points to 2.60
percent, the highest closing level since Nov. 22, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Tel-Bond 40 Index (TEL-B40)  of corporate
bonds rose 0.1 percent to 263.58.  The shekel weakened for the first time in three days,
declining 0.2 percent to 3.7177 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
