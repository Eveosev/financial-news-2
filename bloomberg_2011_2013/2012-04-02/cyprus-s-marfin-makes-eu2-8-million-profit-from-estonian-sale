Marfin Popular Bank Pcl (CPB) , Cyprus’s
second-biggest lender, said it made a profit of about 2.8
million euros ($3.7 million) from the sale of a 71 percent stake
in Marfin Pank Eesti AS, its Estonian unit.  Marfin completed the sale to Ukraine’s Ukrselhosprom Pcf
LLC for 6.6 million euros, as part of a strategy to refocus on
its Cypriot base, the Nicosia-based bank said in a  statement  to
the Cyprus Stock Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
