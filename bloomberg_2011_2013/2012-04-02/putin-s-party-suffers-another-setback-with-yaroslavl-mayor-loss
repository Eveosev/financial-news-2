Prime Minister and President-elect
Vladimir Putin’s United  Russia  party suffered another electoral
setback with an opposition politician’s landslide election as
mayor of Yaroslavl.  Local lawmaker Yevgeny Uralshov won yesterday’s second-
round election with almost 70 percent of the vote, while  United
Russia ’s Yakov Yakushev got about 28 percent, according to
preliminary results released today by municipal electoral
authorities. Yakushev, a businessman, was appointed deputy mayor
of the city, which lies 250 kilometers (160 miles) northeast of
Moscow, two weeks before the first round of the election on
March 4, state news service RIA Novosti said.  United Russia lost its two-thirds majority in December
parliamentary elections, with opposition groups claiming the
official result inflated the ruling party’s score to about 50
percent from 30 percent. The allegations of fraud sparked the
biggest protests in Putin’s 12 years in power.  While Putin, 59, won election to a six-year Kremlin term in
last month’s presidential poll, he faces a series of regional
electoral challenges after agreeing to legislation to restore
direct elections for governors, who have been appointed since
2004. Up to a quarter of Russia’s 83 governors may be replaced
this year, according to  Standard & Poor’s .  An opposition candidate, Sergei Andreyev, was elected last
month as mayor of the Volga city of Togliatti, where the
country’s largest carmaker,  OAO AvtoVAZ (AVAZ) , is based. United Russia
also lost control of the mayor’s post to the opposition
Communists in the regional capitals of Oryol and Naryan-Mar in
January and March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
