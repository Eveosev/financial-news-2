Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos probably won’t lose power in  Africa ’s second-biggest
crude producer, as oil income strengthens his rule, said former
Prime Minister Marcolino Moco, a member of the ruling Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola.  “It’s a dictatorship of oil that we have,” Moco told
reporters today in Johannesburg, in neighboring South Africa.
“The president dominates completely. It’s not a one-party
state; it’s a one-person state.”  Foreign companies including  ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Chevron
Corp. (CVX) , BP Plc and  Total SA (FP)  are pumping oil in Angola, where Dos
Santos has ruled since 1979. The country produced about 1.78
million barrels a day in March,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  A lack of respect for human rights, corruption and
authorities not respecting the law indicate “things are not
good,” said Moco, who was prime minister from 1992 to 1996 and
has been a frequent critic of  Dos Santos . “As a lawyer and as a
citizen, I am very concerned.”  Rui Falcao, an MPLA spokesman, didn’t immediately answer
phone calls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
