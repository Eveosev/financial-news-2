The price of German  milk-production
rights  was unchanged from five months ago as farmers prepare for
the end of the European Union’s quota system in 2015,
agricultural lobby Deutscher Bauernverband reported.  The right to produce a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cow’s milk
in Germany sold for an average 11 euro cents ($0.10) at auction
today, the same as in November, the Berlin-based DBV wrote in a
 report  on its website.  Farmers in Germany, the EU’s biggest milk producer, trade
milk-production rights three times a year. Prices have dropped
to less than half of the 23 cents a kilogram paid in April 2009.  The price to produce milk fell 1 cent to 12 cents a
kilogram in western  Germany  while climbing 1 cent to 4 cents in
the eastern part of the country, according to the DBV. Farmers
traded rights to produce 204.2 million kilograms of milk,
according to the auction report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
