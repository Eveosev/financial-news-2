Ecuador’s President  Rafael Correa 
said he will skip the upcoming Summit of the Americas, a meeting
of regional leaders, after Cuba wasn’t invited.  “While I’m president I won’t attend another Summit of the
‘Americas’ until they make the decisions that the great
fatherland demands of us.” Correa said today in a statement
published in the official gazette. “It’s unacceptable that
these summits skirt such fundamental issues as the inhuman
blockade of Cuba.”  The U.S.-backed summit, which President Barack Obama is
scheduled to attend, is scheduled to begin April 14 in the
Colombian resort city of Cartagena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
