A person has been injured at  AGL
Energy Ltd. (AGK)  and Meridian Energy Ltd.’s MacArthur wind farm site
in Australia, said Andrew Hilton, a spokewman for  Vestas Wind
Systems A/S (VWS) , which supplied turbines for the project.  Hilton didn’t immediately have further details. The
Australian Broadcasting Corp. cited police as saying a man in
his 20s suffered chest and pelvic injuries after being caught by
a turbine blade at the wind farm today.  The 420-megawatt MacArthur farm is Australia’s largest wind
energy project, and will cost about $1 billion to build
according to the project  website . The project is due for
completion early next year. It will have 140 3-megawatt Vestas
V112 turbines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
