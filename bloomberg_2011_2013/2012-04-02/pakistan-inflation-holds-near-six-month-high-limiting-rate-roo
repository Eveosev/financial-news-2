Pakistan ’s inflation held at close
to a six-month high in March, limiting scope to bolster economic
expansion by lowering interest rates.  Consumer prices rose 10.8 percent from a year earlier, the
 Bureau of Statistics  said in Islamabad today, compared with an
11.05 percent gain in February and the median 11.03 percent
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of eight economists.  The fastest inflation in Asia after Vietnam prompted the
central bank to leave interest rates unchanged at 12 percent for
a second meeting in February. Price rises, the lingering impact
of floods in 2010 and 2011 and an insurgency near the Afghan
border are crimping expansion in the $200 billion economy.  “The central bank will remain on the sidelines,” Khalid Iqbal Siddiqui, the head of research at Karachi-based United
Bank Ltd., said before the report. “Inflationary pressures are
not going away and that’s the biggest worry for policy makers.”  Pakistan’s rupee weakened to a record low against the  U.S.
dollar  on March 23, threatening to spur the cost of imports such
as oil. Petroleum-product costs,  currency devaluation  and
 government borrowing  from the central bank are likely to push
prices higher, the  State Bank  of Pakistan said on March 20. The
nation raised fuel tariffs on April 1.  Pakistan’s inflation rate is the second-highest in a basket
of 17 Asia-Pacific economies tracked by Bloomberg. The monetary
authority next reviews rates on April 13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
