Brazilian industrial-machinery maker
 Weg SA (WEGE3)  expects sales in Europe to grow as much as 12 percent
this year as it seeks acquisitions and boosts its team,
according to International Director Gustavo Iensen.  The company forecasts that net sales will increase 8
percent to 12 percent in 2012 from about 310 million euros ($412
million) last year, Iensen said in a telephone interview from
the company’s headquarters in Santa Catarina,  Brazil .  “In some European countries we have plenty of space to
grow, in spite of the crisis,” said Iensen. “We are still
optimistic and we are introducing new products.”  Weg plans to increase its team in Europe by as much as 10
percent, mostly in sales, he said. The company currently employs
about 750 people in  Europe , according to Iensen.  The company is currently seeking acquisitions in Europe in
the field of electric engines and automation, Iensen said.  “We are targeting some companies already,” he said,
declining to name them. The company is likely to make at least
one acquisition in the second half, he said.  Weg also expects its core low-voltage motors business in
Europe to benefit from a European Union law introduced last June
which stipulates minimum efficiency levels for electric engines
sold in the region, Iensen said.  Weg  rose  1.1 percent to 20.01 reais at 4:53 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo . The benchmark Bovespa stock index climbed 1.3 percent.  -- Editor: Adriana Brasileiro  To contact the reporter on this story:
