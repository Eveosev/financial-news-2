Ukraine will need to re-seed 2.5
million hectares (6.2 million acres) of winter grains for the
2012 harvest, said Serhiy Petrenko, deputy head of the agrarian
market department of Ukraine’s  Agriculture Ministry .  That’s lower than the ministry’s month-ago estimate of 3
million to 3.5 million hectares and is based on samples of
grains taken in March, the official said today in Kiev.  The winter grain loss will be compensated by expanding corn
areas, Petrenko said, reiterating the ministry’s grain harvest
forecast of 45 million metric tons to 50 million tons. The wheat
harvest will be between 8 million tons and 14 million tons, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
