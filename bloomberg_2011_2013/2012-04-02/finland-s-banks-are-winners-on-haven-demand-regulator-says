Finland ’s banks are tapping lower
short-term borrowing costs because of investor demand for safer
assets, the AAA rated country’s financial regulator said.  Banks doing business in Finland, including  Nordea Bank AB (NDA) 
and Sampo Bank, a unit of Danske Bank A/S, have attracted “safe
haven demand,” the Helsinki-based Financial Supervisory
Authority said in a report today. This has pushed down the
banks’ short-term borrowing costs, the regulator said.  “Large Finnish banks have benefited from their relatively
strong position among European banks,” the FSA said.  Lenders in the Nordic nation have “good” liquidity and
“sound” solvency, with the core Tier 1 capital ratio at 13.1
percent at the end of last year, the regulator said.  Banks need to protect their operations as the implied risk
from the region’s debt crisis to the Finnish financial industry
remains “significant,” Anneli Tuominen, who heads the
regulator, said in the statement. The risks mean lenders must
“maintain a good level of vigilance,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
