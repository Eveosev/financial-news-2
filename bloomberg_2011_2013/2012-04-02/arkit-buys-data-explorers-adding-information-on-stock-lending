Markit Group Ltd. bought  Data
Explorers , which collects and sells information on securities
lending, from private-equity firm Bowmark Capital LLP.  The price wasn’t disclosed. Markit, with more than 2,300
employees, provides derivative and bond data and competes with
Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP in selling information to the
financial-services industry. Data Explorers, whose information
is carried by Bloomberg, says it offers data on more than $12
trillion of securities and 20,000 institutional funds.  “This acquisition comes as the new regulatory environment
is changing the dynamics of the securities financing markets,”
the companies said in a statement today. “By combining Data
Explorers’ data set with its own products and services, Markit
will be able to develop new offerings allowing clients to
optimize their use of collateral.”  Data Explorers provides information on  securities lending 
as a lens into short sales, which involve borrowing a stock and
selling it in a bet that the price will fall. Markit said it
plans to develop new products in exchange-traded funds, dividend
forecasting and quantitative research after the Data Explorers
purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
