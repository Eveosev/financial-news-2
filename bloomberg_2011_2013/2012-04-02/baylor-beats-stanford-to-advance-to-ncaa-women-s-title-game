Baylor University improved its
record to 39-0 and advanced to the championship game of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association women’s basketball
tournament with a 59-47 win over  Stanford University .  With one more victory -- against the  University of Notre
Dame  in tomorrow’s title game -- Baylor would be the first team
in college basketball history to win 40 games in a season.  Baylor beat Notre Dame in an earlier meeting between the
schools this season, winning 94-81 on Nov. 20. The Fighting
Irish (35-3) defeated the University of Connecticut 83-75 in
overtime in yesterday’s first semifinal game in Denver, which is
also where the championship will be held.  “We beat them earlier in the season, but we’ve got to
erase that because this is the game everybody wants,” Baylor
All-American center Brittney Griner, who had 32 points and 14
rebounds against  Notre Dame  in November, said in a televised
interview.  Griner had 13 points and nine rebounds yesterday while
Terran Condrey added 13 points for Baylor, which used a 10-1
scoring run early in the second half in Denver to break open a
one-point game.  Nnemkadi Ogwumike had 22 points and nine rebounds for
Stanford, which finishes the season 35-2 after having its 32-
game winning streak snapped.  Notre Dame outscored Connecticut 16-8 in overtime as
Brittany Mallory hit a pair of three-pointers and scored seven
of her 11 points to help snap a 67-67 tie.  “We didn’t want this to be our last game,” Mallory said.
“We dug deep.”  Natalie Novosel had 20 points and Skylar Diggins added 19
for the Fighting Irish, who return to the championship game for
the second year in a row. Notre Dame, which won its lone title
in 2001, also beat  Connecticut  (33-5) at last year’s Final Four
before losing to  Texas A&M  in the final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
