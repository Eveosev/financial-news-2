Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced,
reversing an earlier decline, on speculation the central bank
intervened to currency losses that may spur inflation.  Consumer-price gains quickened to 3.97 percent in March,
from 3.56 percent in February, the  Central Bureau of Statistics 
said in Jakarta today. The median forecast of 19 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase of 4 percent.  Bank
Indonesia  will continue to monitor and intervene in the currency
and secondary bond markets to stabilize the rupiah, according to
a statement posted on its website March 8.  “The central bank has signaled that it is very aggressive
in intervening near the 9,200 level,” said Aris Setiawan, a
foreign-exchange trader at PT Rabobank International Indonesia
in Jakarta.  The rupiah rose 0.3 percent to 9,140 per dollar as of 4:56
p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency weakened as much as 0.2 percent to
9,185 earlier. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined 0.3
percentage point to 7.50 percent, the lowest since September.  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds
dropped seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 5.86
percent, according to final prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
