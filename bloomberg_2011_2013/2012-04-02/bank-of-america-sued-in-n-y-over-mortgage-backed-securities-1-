Bank of America Corp.  was sued by
 Bank Hapoalim BM (POLI)  and Principal Life Insurance Co. for fraud and
breach of contract over the sale of almost $960 million worth of
mortgage-backed securities.  Principal Life sued Charlotte-based Bank of America over
its investment in $239 million worth of the securities,
according to documents filed in New York State Supreme Court in
 Manhattan  on March 30. Principal Life, a unit of  Des Moines ,
Iowa-based Principal Financial Group, sued JPMorgan Chase & Co.
in the same court earlier this month over $114.9 million worth
of the securities.  Bank Hapoalim, Israelâ€™s second-biggest bank by assets, sued
over $721 million. Pools of home loans securitized into bonds
were a central part of the housing bubble that helped send the
U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing
market collapsed, and the crisis swept up lenders and investment
banks as the market for the securities evaporated.  Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, said he
had no immediate comment on the lawsuits.  The cases are Principal Life Insurance Co. v.  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) , 651015/2012 and 651017/2012, and Bank Hapoalim
B.M. v. Bank of America Corp., 651022/2012, New York State
Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
