JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  was sued by  DZ
Bank (DZBK) , Germany’s largest cooperative lender, over allegations the
bank made false and misleading statements in selling residential
mortgage-backed securities.  The lawsuit, filed March 30, seeks about $402 million in
damages, according to a court filing.  The complaint was the second filed this year by  DZ Bank 
against JPMorgan in New York state Supreme Court over the
investments, pools of home loans securitized into bonds that
were a central part of the housing bubble that helped send the
U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s.  DZ Bank sued New York-based JPMorgan on Jan. 31, saying it
bought $85 million worth of the securities based on flawed
offering materials. It sued HSBC Holdings Plc,  Europe ’s biggest
bank, the next day over $122 million worth of the investments.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the suit.  The case is Deutsche Zentral Genossenschaftsbank AG v.
JPMorgan Chase & Co., 651021/2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
