Czech manufacturing output rose at
the fastest pace in six months in March as new domestic orders
continued to grow.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI rose to 52.1 from
50.5 in February, the bank said today in an e-mailed report. A
result greater than 50 signals improvement in manufacturing
performance.  Czech economic  growth  depends on demand for its products
from the European Union, which buys about 80 percent of the
countryâ€™s exports with Germany accounting for a third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
