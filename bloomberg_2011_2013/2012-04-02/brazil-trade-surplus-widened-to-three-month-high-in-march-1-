Brazil ’s trade surplus widened to
its biggest since December last month as the real weakened by
more than any other major currency in March.  Brazil posted a  trade  surplus of $2.02 billion, the Trade
Ministry said in a report distributed today in Brasilia.
Economists had expected a surplus of $1.5 billion, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 21 analysts.  The real weakened 6 percent against the dollar in March,
the biggest fall of all the currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
after President  Dilma Rousseff  raised taxes on foreign
investment to protect Brazil from what she called a “monetary
tsunami” created by stimulus policies in rich nations.  Exports rose to $20.9 billion from $19.3 billion the same
month a year earlier, while imports increased to $18.9 billion
from $17.7 billion. Economists expected exports of $21.1 billion
and imports of $19.6 billion, according to the median forecast
from 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.8311 per dollar at 3:39
p.m. local time. In the first two months of the year, the
currency gained 8.7 percent, the most among 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, prompting the government to take measures
to weaken the real to help the nation’s manufacturers.  Industrial output suffered its biggest drop in three years
in January, even after retail sales grew at the fastest pace
since February 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
