The World Bank’s  International
Finance Corp.  unit is studying renewable-energy project funding
for  Morocco  and Jordan this year as their governments seek to
reduce imports of fossil fuels.  “These are countries with strong renewables potential
where the sector could potentially be a competitor with
industrial sources of generation,” Adam Schwartzman, an
Istanbul-based senior investment officer at the unit, said in a
telephone interview.  The IFC has allocated a greater share of its power-
generation funding to renewables since 2008 as nations seek to
meet rising demand without adding to emissions. Jordan, which
relies mostly on imported energy, has suffered disruptions in
natural-gas deliveries from  Egypt  amid pipeline attacks, while
Morocco, also dependent on imported fossil fuels, is developing
a plan for 2,000 megawatts of solar capacity by 2020.  The IFC is studying funds for wind and solar technologies
as  Jordan  faces fuel-supply constraints, Schwartzman said.
Further north, Albania, Croatia and Ukraine are also “bringing
potentially attractive projects to market,” he said, without
elaborating.  Investments in clean sources of power now account for 60
percent of the IFC’s electricity generation business after the
Washington-based unit invested $3.8 billion in 90 projects, or
about 4,500 megawatts, in four years, according to Schwartzman.  Loans to the 60.4-megawatt Karadzhalovo solar project in
Bulgaria, the 68-megawatt Zorlu wind project in  Pakistan  and the
228-megawatt  Cernavoda and Pestera  wind parks in  Romania  show
that “significant, path-breaking renewables transactions can
still be financed in these difficult times,” he said, adding
that those nations continue to present financing opportunities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
