Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  reversed
earlier gains, heading for its fourth day of decline, on
speculation China’s policy makers will maintain lending curbs
after a manufacturing report beat estimates.  Sany Heavy Equipment International Holdings Co. (631) , a Chinese
maker of construction equipment, sank 2.9 percent. Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd. dropped 2.5 percent, extending a 13 percent
plunge on March 30 after the arrests of the company’s co-
chairmen in a bribery probe. Jiangxi Copper Co. added 2 percent
as futures on the metal gained.  “It’s not like it’s all good now and we can all go off to
the races,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based strategist at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd., which manages almost $100 billion.
“Concerns about  China ’s slowdown will continue until we see
growth numbers clearly recovering. We still need to see more
commitment to easing.”  The Hang Seng Index slipped 0.3 percent to 20,492.73 at the
midday trading break in Hong Kong, reversing gains of as much as
0.5 percent. Volume on the index was about 37 percent lower than
the 30-day moving average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The benchmark index has fallen 3.6 percent in the
past two weeks as companies from PICC Property & Casualty Co.
and China Shipping Container Lines Co. missed earnings estimates.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
was little changed at 10,642.23 after a gauge of Chinese
manufacturing climbed to a one-year high, according to a report
released yesterday by the government.  ‘Easing Needed’  “Policy easing is still needed to avoid a hard landing,”
said Shen Jianguang, a Hong Kong-based economist for Mizuho
Securities Asia Ltd., who previously worked for the
 International Monetary Fund  and the  European Central Bank .  Mainland builders and makers of construction equipment
declined.  China Communications Construction Co. (1800)  decreased 3.3
percent to HK$7.53. Sany Heavy dropped 2.9 percent to HK$5.70.  Sun Hung Kai fell 2.5 percent to HK$94.05, extending
declines for a second day after the arrest of co-chairmen Thomas
and  Raymond Kwok  by Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against
Corruption.  Standard & Poor’s  lowered the outlook for the
developer’s A+  credit rating  to negative, saying the probe may
“weaken” management’s stability and the company’s reputation.  SouthGobi Surges  Among stocks that advanced, SouthGobi Resources Ltd. surged
17 percent to HK$59.85 after Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. agreed
to buy Ivanhoe Mines Ltd.’s stake in the coal miner for C$889
million ($891 million).  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal,
climbed 2 percent to HK$18.22. Copper climbed on signs of
strengthening economic growth in China and the U.S., the world’s
two largest consumers of the metal.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent
today. The index gained 0.4 percent in  New York  on March 30
after Americans increased spending by the most in seven months,
according to the U.S. Commerce Department. A separate report
showed that consumer sentiment climbed to the highest since
February 2011.  Exporters gained. Yue Yuen Industrial (Holdings) Ltd., a
maker of shoes for Nike Inc., increased 4.6 percent to HK$28.50.
 Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , maker of Ryobi power tools, added 0.4
percent to HK$10.54.  The Hang Seng Index climbed 12 percent in the first quarter
as signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering fueled confidence in the
outlook for exports. The rally boosted the value of  stocks  on
the gauge to 10.3 times  estimated earnings . That compares with
13.5 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11 times for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index expiring this month fell 0.2
percent to 20,468. The HSI Volatility Index added 0.8 percent to
20.41, indicating options traders expect a swing of about 5.9
percent in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
