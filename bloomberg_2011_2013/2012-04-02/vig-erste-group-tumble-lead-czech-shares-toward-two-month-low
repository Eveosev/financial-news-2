Vienna Insurance Group AV (VIG)  and  Erste
Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led a drop in Czech shares as euro-area
manufacturing contracted an eighth month and unemployment rose
to the highest in more than 14 years.  VIG fell 2.4 percent to 799 koruna by 12:38 p.m. in Prague
and Erste retreated 0.8 percent to 423.5 koruna. The 14-member
 PX (PX)  gauge, where the two Austrian companies have a combined 32
percent weighting, slid 0.4 percent to 968.8, headed for its
lowest close in two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
