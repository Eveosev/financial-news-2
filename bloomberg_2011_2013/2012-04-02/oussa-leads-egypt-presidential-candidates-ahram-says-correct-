(Corrects spelling of candidate’s name in second
paragraph.)  Amre Moussa is the front-runner
among Egyptian presidential candidates, according to a survey
published by the state-run  Al Ahram  newspaper.  Moussa, a former foreign minister, came first with 31.5
percent, followed by 22.7 percent for Hazem Salah Abou Ismail, a
Salafist candidate, the survey, conducted by Al Ahram Center for
Political and Strategic Studies, showed, according to the Cairo-
based newspaper. Moussa’s support fell from 41.1 percent in an
October survey, the newspaper said.  The survey was based on interviews between March 25 and
March 29 with 1,200 people nationwide except in border
provinces, Al Ahram said. Ninety-four percent of those surveyed
said they will vote in the election, Al Ahram said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
