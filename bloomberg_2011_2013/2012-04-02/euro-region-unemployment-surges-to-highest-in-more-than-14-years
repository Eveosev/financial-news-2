European  unemployment  increased to
the highest in more than 14 years in February as companies from
 Spain  to  Italy  eliminated jobs to weather the region’s crisis.  The jobless rate in the 17-nation euro region rose to 10.8
percent from 10.7 percent in January, the European Union’s
 statistics office  in Luxembourg said today. That’s the highest
since June 1997, before the euro was introduced, and in line
with the median forecast of 33 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. At 23.6 percent, Spain had the highest jobless rate
among member states.  European companies are under pressure to cut costs and
eliminate jobs after tougher austerity measures eroded consumer
demand and pushed economies from  Greece  to Ireland into
recession. While leaders have stepped up efforts to contain the
region’s fiscal crisis, confidence in the economic outlook
declined in March and manufacturing contracted.  In the 27-nation EU, the jobless rate rose to 10.2 percent
in February from 10.1 percent in the previous month, today’s
report showed. About 17.13 million people in the euro area were
unemployed in February, up 162,000 from the previous month.  In  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, the jobless rate held
at 5.7 percent in February, according to the trend component,
while unemployment in France remained at 10 percent. In Italy,
the jobless rate rose to 9.3 percent from 9.1 percent based on
provisional data. There was no data available for Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
