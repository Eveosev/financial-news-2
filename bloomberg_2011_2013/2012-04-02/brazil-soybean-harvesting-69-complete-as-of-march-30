Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer after the U.S., harvested 69
percent of the current crop as of March 30, down from 70 percent
a year earlier, crop researcher AgRural Commodities Agricolas
said.  The outlook for the country’s soybean output in the crop
year that started Sept. 1 was maintained at 66.7 million metric
tons, Curitiba, Brazil-based AgRural said in an e-mailed report.  Output of the oilseed will be less than 75.3 million tons
reaped in the previous harvest and 73.1 million tons estimated
initially for the current crop before dry weather damaged fields
in southern Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
