Car sales in  Italy  fell 27 percent
in March to 138,137, the Transport Ministry said on its website
today.  Fiat Group’s sales fell 36 percent to 35,990. Its market
share contracted to 26 percent, according to foreign carmaker
association UNRAE.  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne , who expects
Italian car sales to fall to the lowest since 1985 this year,
said last week that March was a “horrible” month for
deliveries in the country.  “Hundreds of thousands of jobs are at risk becuase of the
sales crisis,” Filippo Pavan Bernacchi, head of the dealer
association Federauto, said today in an interview in Rome.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
