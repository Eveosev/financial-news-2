The worst is over for the $10
trillion U.S. Treasury market following the biggest quarterly
rout since 2010, say Wall Street’s largest bond trading firms.  After rising to as high as 2.4 percent last month from 1.88
percent at the end of 2011, the  yield  on the benchmark 10-year
note will finish 2012 at 2.49 percent, according to the average
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of the 21 primary dealers
that trade with the  Federal Reserve . That’s the same as a
January poll, suggesting the market isn’t ready to declare a
bear market in bonds after a 30-year bull run.  Signs of strength in the economy, which caused a 5.56
percent loss in bonds maturing in 10 years or more last quarter,
may fade in the second half of 2012, the dealers say. Tax cuts
are expiring, $1 trillion of mandatory federal budget cuts are
due to kick in and $100-a-barrel oil is eating into  consumer
spending . With inflation in check, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said last week that the central bank will consider further
stimulus, even after upgrading its economic outlook March 13.  “The back-up that we’ve seen over the past three or four
weeks was not fully justified by what we’re seeing in the
data,” said  Aneta Markowska , a senior U.S. economist at primary
dealer  Societe Generale  SA in New York. The 10-year yield will
end the year at 2.25 percent, she said in an interview March 27.  Dealer Holdings  Primary  dealer holdings  of U.S. government debt rose to $91
billion last month, from a net bet against the securities of
$53.4 billion in May, according to the Fed. In the survey, 15
say the odds are that the Fed will need a third round of bond
purchases, or  quantitative easing , to bolster the economy.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note dropped three basis
points or 0.03 percentage point at 10:24 a.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
security due in February 2022 rose 8/32, or $2.50 per $1,000
face amount, to 98 12/32.  Housing reports the last two weeks showed a key part of the
economy remains under pressure. The Commerce Department said
March 23 new home sales fell to a 313,000 annual pace in
February, the slowest since October, from the 318,000 rate in
January that was weaker than previously reported. The National
Association of Realtors said existing-home  sales  eased to a 4.59
million rate last month from January’s 4.63 million.  ‘Unusually Large Layoffs’  The economic recovery isn’t yet assured and unemployment
remains too high, Bernanke told ABC News anchor  Diane Sawyer ,
according to transcripts of the interview released March 27.  The remarks came a day after Bernanke said in a speech that
the drop in the  unemployment rate  to 8.3 percent may reflect “a
reversal of the unusually large layoffs that occurred during
late 2008 and over 2009.” Significant further improvement would
likely require faster growth, he said. The Fed hasn’t tightened
monetary policy with joblessness at the existing level since it
fought surging inflation in the 1980s.  “In the past week Bernanke’s gotten in front of every
microphone he could find and gotten the market to realize that
we shouldn’t have priced out QE3 and even if you don’t think
it’s going to happen you have to attribute some sort of
probability to it, and that he’s going to stay accommodative and
potentially increase accommodation,”  John Briggs , a U.S.
government bond strategist at primary dealer RBS Securities Inc.
in Stamford,  Connecticut , said in an interview on March 28.  Forecast Range  Yield forecasts at the primary dealers range from 2 percent
at RBS, Scotia Capital and  Barclays Capital  to 3 percent at
Deutsche Bank AG, Jefferies & Co. and BMO Financial.  Even if the most bearish forecasts prove true, yields would
remain below the average of 3.85 percent over the past decade,
4.98 percent over the past 20 years and 6.48 percent since 1982.  The bull market for bonds began after then-Fed Chairman
Paul Volcker began to lower borrowing costs from a high of 20
percent in 1980 after taming inflation.  President Barack Obama needs the support of the  bond market 
to help finance a  budget deficit  projected to exceed $1 trillion
for the fourth year as he runs for re-election in November.  While the amount of  marketable debt  outstanding has more
than doubled to $10.2 trillion from $4.34 trillion in mid-2007
as the U.S. sold bonds to pay for spending programs designed to
pull the economy out of the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression, interest expense equaled 3 percent of the
economy in fiscal 2011 ended Sept. 30. That’s down from 4
percent in 1999, when the U.S. ran budget surpluses.  Bond Losses  Bernanke helped spark last quarter’s selloff when the
central bank upgraded its assessment of the economy at its March
13 policy meeting. Losses in long-term bonds were the most since
they tumbled 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, and compare with a
3.22 percent return for company debt and a 12.6 percent gain in
the Standard & Poor’s 500, including reinvested interest.  Traders immediately reduced bets the central bank would
favor more bond purchases and moved forward the date that they
anticipated the Fed would raise  interest rates  to 2013 from late
2014.  “At this point in the policy cycle it is common for market
participants to get ahead of themselves,” said  Vincent Reinhart , chief U.S. economist at primary dealer Morgan Stanley
and a former senior Fed official, in an interview on March 28.
“The market’s got a rosier view of the outlook.”  Reinhart forecasts 10-year yields will end the year at 2.25
percent, and there’s a better than even chance of QE3 after the
Fed already bought $2.3 trillion of bonds from December 2008 to
June to avert deflation and spur growth. It’s now replacing $400
billion of shorter-term maturity Treasuries in its holdings with
longer-term debt in a policy traders call Operation Twist.  Rising Loans  There are enough signs of strength in the economy and
credit markets to keep the Fed from adding more stimulus,
according to  Maury Harris , the chief economist at primary dealer
UBS Securities LLC in New York. Fed data show commercial and
industrial  loans  outstanding rose to $1.38 trillion as of March
14 from the post-crisis low of $1.2 trillion in October 2010.  “The banks are expanding lending now as a result of the
earlier QE, and that’s a reason why now we’re seeing better job
growth,” Harris said in a March 28 telephone interview. “You
put so much in the system, some of it made a difference.”  UBS expects 10-year yields will end 2012 at 2.7 percent.  Gross domestic product in the U.S. will probably expand 2.2
percent in 2012, according to the median estimate of more than
70 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That’s slower than the 3.1
percent posted in 2005 and 2.7 percent in 2006 before the
recession and financial crisis.  ‘Spring Slowdown’  “We’re going to have some Spring slowdown in housing, some
Spring slowdown in employment, and the first opportunity they
get to juice the system they will,” Steven Ricchiuto, chief
economist in New York at primary dealer Mizuho Securities USA,
said in a March 28 telephone interview in reference to Fed
policy makers.  The firm sees 10-year yields ending the year at 2.5
percent, and places a greater than 50 percent chance on QE3.  RBC Capital Markets  is focusing on  Europe , where the
sovereign debt crisis may still curb the global economy.
European leaders capped new lending for bailouts last week at
500 billion euros ($667 billion), after a Germany-led coalition
opposed a further expansion of the region’s anti-crisis
firewall.  The International Monetary Fund’s mission chief to  Greece ,
 Poul Thomsen , said March 28 that while the nation has made an
“aggressive” start, it will take at least a decade to fully
complete the country’s restructuring. Two days later,  Spain ,
under threat of falling victim to the crisis, said it will raise
taxes and cut spending to achieve 27 billion euros in deficit
cuts as it tries to trim its  budget deficit  by a third.  Tom Porcelli , chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets,
expects 10-year yields will end 2012 at 2.25 percent and the Fed
will implement QE3, he said in a March 29 interview.  “Europe will continue to be a factor on the macro backdrop
for the foreseeable future.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
