Eisai Co. (4523) ’s Halaven medicine failed
to win the backing of the U.K.’s health-cost agency in final
guidance on the treatment of advanced  breast cancer , even after
the Japanese drugmaker offered to reduce the price.  While Halaven may help some patients live a little longer,
the drug also caused more side effects than treatments already
available on the National Health Service, the  National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence  said today in an e-mailed
statement. The agency, known as NICE, advises the state-run NHS
on which treatments represent value for money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
