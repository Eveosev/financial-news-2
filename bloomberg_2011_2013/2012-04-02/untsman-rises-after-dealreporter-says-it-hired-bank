Huntsman Corp. (HUN) , the U.S. chemicals
producer founded by Jon Huntsman Sr., rose the most in three
weeks after DealReporter said it hired Bank of America Corp. to
explore a potential sale of the company.  Huntsman rose 5.6 percent to $14.79 as of 2:20 p.m. in New
York. Earlier it climbed as much as 6.1 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since March 8.  DealReporter cited two people in the industry whom it
didn’t identify.  Gary Chapman , a spokesman for Huntsman, which
is run from  Salt Lake City  and The Woodlands, Texas, declined to
comment in an e-mail.  Jon Huntsman Sr. said in a March 8 investor presentation
that he’d pursue a sale of the company “at the right price”
because it’s being undervalued by the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
