U.S. corn  planting  is off to
the fastest start since at least 1980 as record Midwest
temperatures warmed and firmed fields for early fieldwork,
the government said.  About 3 percent of the corn was planted as of
yesterday, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in
a report. The government did not report planting progress
before the first or second Sunday in April in the past 32
years. Seeding on April 10 last year was 3 percent
completed, with 1 percent or less in Iowa, Illinois,
Nebraska and Minnesota, the biggest growers.  “Soil moisture will be favorable throughout the
Midwest during the next two weeks and most of the rain that
falls periodically will not be heavy enough to stall
fieldwork for very long,” Drew Lerner, the president of
World Weather Inc. in  Overland Park , Kansas, said today in
a report. “Conditions for planting, germination and early
crop development should be favorable.”  Across the U.S., 7,700 daily high temperature records
were set or matched in March, according to the National
Climate Data Center in Asheville,  North Carolina .  In Iowa, the biggest corn-producing state, the warm
weather boosted soil temperatures at 4-inch depths to more
than 60 degrees, according to Iowa State University
reserachers. Corn requires soil to remain above 50 degrees
for about seven days to germinate,  Bob Nielsen , an
agronomist at  Purdue University  in Lafayette, Indiana, said
in a  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
