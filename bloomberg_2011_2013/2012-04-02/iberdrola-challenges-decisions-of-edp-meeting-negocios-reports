Iberdrola SA (IBE)  has asked a court in
Lisbon to cancel the decisions taken at a shareholder meeting of
Portuguese utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA on Feb. 20,
Jornal de Negocios reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  Voting right limits in EDP were increased to 25 percent at
that shareholder meeting, which also appointed board members
including representatives of  China Three Gorges Corp. (CJSXGZ) , the
Portuguese newspaper said. Before the meeting, Iberdrola said
that the Portuguese state should not vote on those points,
according to Jornal de Negocios.  Spanish utility Iberdrola holds 6.79 percent of EDP and
does not have a seat on the Portuguese companyâ€™s board due to
competition issues, Jornal de Negocios said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
