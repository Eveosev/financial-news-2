South  Korea ’s won maintained gains
and credit-default swaps declined as Moody’s Investors Service
raised the outlook on the nation’s credit rating to positive
from stable.  Government bonds  fell as investors favored riskier
assets.  The ratings company cited the nation’s fiscal strength and
increased resilience to market turmoil in a statement today.
South Korea’s government announced yesterday a $2.3 billion
 trade surplus  for March, more than the median forecast of $1.5
billion in a Bloomberg survey. Inflation eased to a 20-month low
of 2.6 percent, less than all 11 estimates in a Bloomberg poll,
data released today show. Euro-area finance ministers decided
March 30 that 500 billion euros ($667 billion) of money would be
added to the 300 billion euros committed to fight the debt
crisis.  “The mood in and out of Korea is positive for the won,”
said Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-based analyst at Woori Futures Co.
“The  trade surplus  for two straight months is supportive for
the currency, but gains will be limited as we saw a drop in both
exports and imports.”  The won rose 0.5 percent to 1,127.88 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, after strengthening 1.7 percent in the first
quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,126.85 today, the strongest since March 21. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of
shares jumped 0.8 percent.  “The won reacted for a short moment to the Moody’s report
today, and it seems the upgrade will help prevent sharp declines
in future for the currency,” said Lee Yong Hee, a Seoul-based
currency trader at the Industrial Bank of Korea.  One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, slid 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 7.98 percent. Credit-
default swaps on Korea dropped two basis points to 117 as of
11:54 a.m. in Seoul, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc.  Bonds Fall  South Korea ’s exports fell 1.4 percent from a year earlier
in March, while imports decreased 1.2 percent, government
figures showed yesterday.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 climbed three basis points to 3.58 percent, after declining
eight basis points last week, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
Three-year debt futures dropped to 103.73 from 103.85 on March
30 and the one-year interest-rate swap fell one basis point to
3.54 percent.  “Bonds are declining as there isn’t much momentum to
extend last week’s technical gains,” said Kim Nam Hyun, a
Seoul-based fixed-income analyst at Eugene Investment & Futures.
“The inflation was slower than expected, but considering last
year’s high consumer prices, the figure itself isn’t enough to
support bond prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
