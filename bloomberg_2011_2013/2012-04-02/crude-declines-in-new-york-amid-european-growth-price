Oil declined to near its lowest in
six weeks in  New York  as economic contraction in Europe
countered signs of growth in the U.S. and  China , the world’s
largest consumers of crude.  West Texas Intermediate fell as much as 0.7 percent,
erasing an earlier gain of 0.5 percent. Euro-region
manufacturing declined for an eighth month in March, London-
based Markit Economics said today. While China’s Purchasing
Managers’ Index yesterday rose to a one-year high of 53.1 in
March, analysts described the gain as seasonal and a separate
survey showed exporters struggling.  “High  oil prices , while superficially benefiting
producers, may yet be a curse for the economic recovery,” said
 Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd. in
London, who correctly predicted  Brent crude ’s rise to more than
$120 a barrel this year. “It’s far from clear in which
direction the market will break out of this range, but right now
it looks as if people are betting on a move lower.”  Oil for May delivery slipped as much as 72 cents to $102.30
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $102.46 at 12:56 p.m. London time. It
dropped to $102.13 on March 29, the lowest since Feb. 16. Prices
fell 3.8 percent last month.  Brent oil for May settlement fell 65 cents to $122.23 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The
European benchmark contract’s  premium  to New York-traded WTI was
at $19.97, having settled at $19.86 on March 30, the most since
Oct. 24.  Quarterly Advance  Futures in New York gained 4.2 percent in the first three
months of the year, a second quarterly advance. U.S. payrolls
probably increased in March for a fourth consecutive month,
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said before an April 6
report from the Labor Department. Employment rose by 205,000
after climbing by 227,000 in February, the survey shows.  The European  manufacturing gauge , based on a survey of
purchasing managers, fell to 47.7 from 49 in February, remaining
below the 50 line that divides expansion from contraction,
London-based  Markit Economics  said today. That’s in line with
Markit’s initial estimate.  Oil output in March from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries climbed to the highest level in more than
three years, led by a Libyan production gain, a Bloomberg News
survey showed on March 30.  Production increased 110,000 barrels, or 0.4 percent, to an
average 31.22 million barrels a day in March from a revised
31.11 million in February, according to the survey of  oil
companies , producers and analysts. Output increased to the
highest level since October 2008. The February total was revised
55,000 barrels a day higher. Iranian production fell to the
lowest level in almost 10 years.  China Data  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to 53.1 last month,
China’s logistics federation and the National Bureau of
Statistics said. The gauge has a pattern of rising each March.
In contrast, a PMI from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
showed manufacturing contracting and export orders falling.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators decreased bullish
oil wagers by 6,460, or 2.6 percent, to 241,367 contracts in the
seven days ended March 27, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders report on March 30.  In London, money managers boosted bullish bets on Brent
crude by 11,305 contracts in the week ended March 27,  according
to data from ICE Futures Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 150,883 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
