Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  and Pfizer Inc.’s
experimental Alzheimer’s medicine may reduce the development of
tau tangles in the brain, a hallmark trait of the degenerative
condition, a small study suggested.  More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s, a disease
marked by the buildup of amyloid plaque and snarls of the tau
protein. The drug bapineuzumab is being jointly developed by J&J
and Pfizer to attack the disorder.  The study, reported in the  Archives of Neurology , is the
first to suggest it may work on the tau side of the disease.
While the data showed no difference in beta amyloid levels, the
drug reduced levels of a two forms of tau, according to the
researchers from the University of Gothenburg in  Sweden .  It’s not clear whether the changes will translate into a
clinical benefit, the scientists said. The study analyzed
cerebral spinal fluid for 27 patients treated with bapineuzumab
and 19 given a placebo.  Results from the first pivotal trial designed to show if
bapineuzumab can slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease,
rather than just ease its symptoms, is expected later this year.
At least a dozen potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease in
mid- to late-stage testing have failed in the last decade.  J&J, based in  New Brunswick ,  New Jersey , gained its share
in the drug with its 2009  purchase  of an 18 percent stake in
Dublin-based Elan Corp. for $1 billion. Elan and Wyeth, which
New York-based  Pfizer (PFE)  acquired in 2009, funded the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
