U.K. Foreign Office Minister Mark
Simmonds said the government of Chad should meet its
international obligations and arrest Sudanese President  Umar al- Bashir .  “If President Bashir is not arrested, this will be the
third time the government of Chad has failed to implement
warrants issued by the International Criminal Court for war
crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide,”  Simmonds  said in
a statement today. “The U.K. expects Chad to stand by its
obligations and will be disappointed if it does not do so.”  Bashir is visiting Chad this weekend to attend a summit,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
