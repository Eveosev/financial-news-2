Billy Hunter  was fired as executive
director of the National Basketball Association players union,
one month after an audit of the organization’s finances
concluded he put personal interest ahead of the organization.  The decison was made unanimously by player representatives
from all 30 NBA teams during meetings at a Houston hotel prior
to tomorrow’s All-Star Game and announced at a news conference.
The 70-year-old former federal prosecutor was not allowed to
address players at the meeting.  “Today is a day of change,” union President Derek Fisher
said at the news conference.  The audit concluded that Hunter’s actions, though not
illegal, were ill-advised. That included improper management of
his conflicts of interest and failure to reveal his $3 million-
a-year contract wasn’t properly ratified.  Hunter was placed on indefinite paid leave on Feb. 1
following the audit conducted by the New York law firm Paul
Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison.  Under Hunter’s guidance, the average NBA player’s salary
has grown past $5 million, the highest in U.S. team sports.  NBPA staff attorney  Ron Klempner  was chosen Feb. 1 to serve
as interim executive director until a permanent successor to
Hunter is selected.  To contact the reporters on this story:
