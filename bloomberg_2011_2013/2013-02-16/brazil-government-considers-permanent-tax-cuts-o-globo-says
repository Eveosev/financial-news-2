Brazil’s government is considering
making permanent certain tax cuts that were implemented to spur
the economy, local newspaper O Globo reported.  One of the reductions that would be made permanent is a 3
percent credit for companies that export manufactured goods,
according to the newspaper. Aside from sparking growth, the tax
cuts also would help control inflation, O Globo said  Brazil’s government will implement tax cuts of 85 billion
reais ($43.2 billion) this year, which will include 40 billion
reais in new stimulus for producers, O Globo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
