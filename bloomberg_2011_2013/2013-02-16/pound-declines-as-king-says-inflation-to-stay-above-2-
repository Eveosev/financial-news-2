The pound had its biggest weekly
drop against the dollar since June after Bank of England
Governor  Mervyn King  said inflation will stay above the Bank’s 2
percent target for the next two years even with weak growth.  The pound declined against all of its 16 major peers this
week as the Confederation of British Industry, the U.K.’s
biggest business lobby group, lowered its 2013 growth projection
to 1 percent from 1.4 percent. King said on Feb. 13 that the
economy faces “big challenges” and there were “limits” to
what policy makers could achieve. Gilts fell, with the  10-year
yield  climbing to the highest level since April.  “It’s hard to recommend sterling as a buy,” said  John Hardy , head of currency strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in London.
“When the Bank of England implied they are comfortable with
inflation and that there could be further easing, a longer-term
outlook for sterling is not positive.”  The pound dropped 1.8 percent last week to $1.5521 at 5:10
p.m. in London yesterday, the steepest decline since the period
ended June 1. It fell to $1.5462, the lowest since July 25.
Sterling depreciated 1.8 percent from Feb. 8 to 86.06 pence per
euro. That’s the fifth weekly drop against the single currency
in seven.  Data last week added to evidence that the U.K. economic
expansion is slowing. Retail sales unexpectedly fell in January
for a second consecutive month.  Sales  including fuel declined
0.6 percent from December, when they dropped a revised 0.3
percent, the Office for National Statistics said yesterday. The
median forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for an increase of 0.5 percent.  Pound’s Slide  The pound depreciated 4.4 percent this year, making it the
second-worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 0.7 percent and the euro rose 2.1 percent.  The outlook for consumer prices is higher than was forecast
in November because of a weaker pound and increases in energy
bills, the Bank of England said in its quarterly Inflation
Report released on Feb. 13. The Monetary Policy Committee kept
its asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds and its main
 interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent when it met on Feb. 7.  The  10-year gilt  yield rose 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, from Feb. 8 to 2.19 percent. The rate climbed
to 2.27 percent on Feb. 14, the highest since April 2. The price
of the 1.75 percent bond due September 2022 fell 0.815, or 8.15
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 96.205.  Inflation expectations rose to the highest level in nearly
two years. The 10-year  break-even rate , a market gauge of
inflation expectations derived from a yield gap between gilts
and index-linked securities, increased to 3.29 percentage points
on Feb. 14, the most since April 13, 2011.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 2.7 percent this year
through Feb. 14, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds dropped 1.6 percent and Treasuries fell 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
