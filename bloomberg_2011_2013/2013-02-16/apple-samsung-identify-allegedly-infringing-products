Apple Inc.  and  Samsung Electronics
Co.  identified products they allege infringe their patents for
smartphones and tablet computers as part of a lawsuit in federal
court in San Jose, California.  The filings yesterday were made in a newer of two related
patent cases. The lawsuit, scheduled for  trial  in March 2014,
was filed last year and covers technology in newer smartphones
made by both companies, including Samsung’s Galaxy S III and
Apple’s iPhone 5.  In its filing yesterday, Cupertino, California-based Apple
identified Samsung’s Galaxy Note smartphones and tablet
computer. Samsung claimed “all generations” of Apple’s iPhone
and iPads infringe at least three of its patents, according to
its filing.  U.S. District Judge  Lucy H. Koh  last month rejected Apple’s
request to add additional damages to the first patent
infringement case between the two companies in San Jose. In that
case, a jury awarded Apple $1.05 billion, finding the Suwon,
South Korea-based company infringed six of the iPhone maker’s
mobile-device patents.  Koh said this week she is considering freezing the more
recent smartphone patent dispute scheduled for trial next year
while an appeals court reviews the August verdict.  Last year’s case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co.
Ltd., 11-cv-1846, the case scheduled for trial next year is
Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-cv-630,  U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporters on this story:
