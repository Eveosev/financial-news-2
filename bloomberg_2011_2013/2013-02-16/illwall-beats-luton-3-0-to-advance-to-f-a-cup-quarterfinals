Millwall beat Luton 3-0 to advance
to the quarterfinals of soccer’s F.A. Cup.  James Henry, Rob Hulse and Dany G’Guessan scored the goals
as Millwall reached the final eight of England’s top club
competition for the first time since 2004.  Luton plays in England’s fifth tier and was the seventh
non-League team to reach the fifth round since World War Two.
The Hatters upset Norwich of the Premier League 1-0 in the last
round.  Arsenal hosts Blackburn, MK Dons play Barnsley and Everton
visits Oldham in today’s other F.A. Cup matchups.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
