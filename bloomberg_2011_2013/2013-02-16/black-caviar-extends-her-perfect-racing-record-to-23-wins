Black Caviar, the world’s top-ranked
thoroughbred sprinter, extended her perfect record to 23
straight victories by winning an Australian race that now
carries her name.  The 6-year-old mare, ridden by Luke Nolen and trained by
Peter Moody, beat Moment Of Change by two lengths to win the
1,000-meter Black Caviar Lightning Stakes race at Melbourne’s
Flemington Racecourse in track record time.  It was the Australian thoroughbred’s first race since
preserving her unbeaten record by winning the Diamond Jubilee
Stakes at the U.K.’s Royal Ascot on June 23, when she scraped
home in a photo finish after Nolen eased her up before the line.  “It’s good to have her back,” Moody said in a Channel 7
television interview after the race. “She’s a good-news
story.”  Asked whether Black Caviar will race again, he said
“let’s wait and see.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
