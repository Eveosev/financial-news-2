Spanish and Italian bonds rose as
debt sales this week allayed concern the nations may struggle to
raise funds amid political instability before Italy goes to the
polls to elect a new prime minister.  Yields on Spain’s 10-year bonds fell for the first week in
five as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the
country had achieved “enormous progress” in its reforms.
Demand for the nations’ securities was also buoyed as a report
showed industrial production in the euro-area rose more than
economists forecast. Spain exceeded the Madrid-based Treasury’s
sales target when it auctioned six- and 12-month bills on Feb.
12. Italy sold bonds on Feb. 13 in its last offering before the
Feb. 24-25 elections. German bunds declined.  “The auctions went OK and didn’t cause any upset,” said
 Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at Investec Bank Plc in
London. “Yields had widened out a bit, and maybe we saw a bit
of buying at the back of the wider levels.”  Spain’s 10-year yield fell 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, this week to 5.19 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday after slipping to 5.16 percent on Feb. 14, the
least since Feb. 1. The 5.4 percent securities due January 2023
gained 1.29, or 12.90 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,335) face amount,
to 101.57. The  Italian 10-year yield  declined 17 basis points to
4.38 percent.  Yield Spread  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds instead of comparable German debt narrowed 21 basis points
to 354 basis points. The so-called spread reached 348 basis
points on Feb. 14, the least since Feb. 4. The  Italian 10-year
yield  spread declined 22 basis points to 273 basis points, from
294 basis points on Feb. 8.  The euro region’s manufacturing and services industries
shrank at a slower pace this month, according analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg before the data is released on Feb. 21. The
European Commission is scheduled to release the region’s growth
forecasts the following day.  Spain and Italy’s debt declined in previous weeks as polls
signaled former Italian premier  Silvio Berlusconi  was closing
the gap on election frontrunner  Pier Luigi Bersani  and Spanish
Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy faced opposition calls to resign
over corruption allegations, which he denies.  Italian and Spanish securities held gains even as a report
on Feb. 14 showed the region’s recession deepened more than
economists predicted.  German government bonds handed investors a loss of 1.6
percent this year through Feb. 14, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Italian debt returned 1.2 percent and Spanish
securities gained 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
