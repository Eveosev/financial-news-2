Air Arabia PJSC’s  full-year profit
increased 55 percent as more passengers used the Middle East’s
biggest discount airline for travel.  Net income  climbed to 425 million dirhams ($116 million)
from 274 million dirhams a year earlier, the Sharjah, United
Arab Emirates-based airline said in an e-mailed statement today,
without specifying if the figures included minority interests.
The average estimate of eight analysts was for a profit of 404
million dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Air Arabia continued to demonstrate its concerted efforts
to enter into new markets and launch new ventures,” Chairman
 Sheikh Abdullah Bin Mohammad Al Thani  said in the statement.
“The year 2012 saw Air Arabia expand its global network by
entering new markets and taking more aircraft deliveries.”  Air Arabia, which competes with state-owned FlyDubai, is
adding aircraft to its bases in Morocco and Egypt to capture a
rebound in demand for travel following last year’s so-called
Arab Spring, Chief Executive Officer  Adel Ali  said in March. The
airline halted plans to establish a hub in Jordan in 2011 amid
concern about uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa.  The airline carried more than 5.3 million passengers last
year compared with 4.7 million a year earlier, with an 82
percent seat-load factor, or passengers carried as a percentage
of available seats. Fourth-quarter profit rose 6 percent to 83
million dirhams, while sales climbed 18 percent to 755 million
dirhams.  The carrier, which now operates flights to 82 destinations
from three regional hubs, started nine destinations last year
from its primary hub in Sharjah, the company said. Air Arabia
took delivery of six new A320 aircraft from Airbus SAS in 2012
as part of an order for 44 aircraft placed in 2007.  The company plans to pay a  dividend  of 7 fils a share for
last year.  The stock  climbed 42 percent in 2012 compared with a
20 percent increase for the benchmark Dubai Financial Market
General Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
