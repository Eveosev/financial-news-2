Saudi Arabian shares climbed for the
 sixth trading day , the longest winning streak in more than six
months, after Kingdom Holding Co. bought a stake in a Chinese
online retailer and U.S. stocks rose last week.  Kingdom Holding advanced as much as 6.1 percent to 22.50
riyals, the highest level in five years.  Saudi Basic Industries
Corp.,  the world’s biggest petrochemicals maker, rose the most
in four days. The benchmark  Tadawul All Share Index  added 0.4
percent to 7087.82 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh.  Kingdom Holding, the investment company controlled by
billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, led a group of investors
to purchase a stake valued at 1.5 billion riyals ($400 million)
in 360buy Jingdong Inc., a Beijing-based online retailer. Prince
Alwaleed and Kingdom Holding, who hold stakes in Twitter Inc.,
Apple Inc. and News Corp., have been investing in e-commerce and
technology companies as demand for technology and Internet
services increases.  U.S. stocks rose last week, sending the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index to its longest winning streak in two years, amid
optimism over corporate dealmaking and better-than-estimated
economic data. Among economic reports, claims for jobless
benefits plunged in the latest week, showing U.S. employers have
little need to trim staff as demand improves.  Kingdom Holding closed 2.4 percent higher at 21.7 riyals.
Saudi Basic Industries climbed 0.5 percent to 94 riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian gulf
bourse that operates Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
