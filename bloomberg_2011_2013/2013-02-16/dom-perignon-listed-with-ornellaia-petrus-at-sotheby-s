Dom Perignon Champagne from vintages
spanning more than 30 years goes on sale at a Sotheby’s auction
in New York this month, along with Tuscan Ornellaia wines from
the past two decades and lots from top Bordeaux vineyard Chateau
Petrus.  A four-magnum lot of Dom Perignon Rose Oenotheque 1978 is
estimated to fetch as much as $20,000 at the sale on Feb. 23,
according to the online  Sotheby’s  catalog. The top estimate for
three magnums of the 1966 vintage is $18,000, and $15,000 for
four magnums from 1982.  The sale comes after the London-based Liv-ex  Fine Wine 50
Index  rose 3.5 percent last month, its biggest monthly gain for
two years, after a decline of 9.7 percent in 2012. It has
climbed more than 7 percent since touching a 2½ year low in
November as investors and collectors sought Bordeaux that lost
value during the financial crisis and focused on rarer
Burgundies.  “Some momentum is building,”  Miles Davis , co-founder and
partner in  Wine Asset Managers LLP  in London, said in a phone
interview. “Nearly everything’s bounced off the bottom now.”
WAM has $20 million under management in two funds.  Other wines in the auction include selections from Tuscan
coastal vineyard  Tenuta dell’Ornellaia  covering most vintages
since 1990. A 12-liter Balthazar from 2010 is valued by
Sotheby’s at as much $6,000 while six double-magnums spanning
the years 1997 to 2002 have top estimates of $5,000.  Among the auction lots carrying the highest estimates by
Sotheby’s are a case of  Chateau Petrus  2000 Pomerol, valued at
as much as $35,000, and 12 bottles of Medoc first-growth Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild from the same year with an estimate range to
$20,000.  Here is a list of global wine sales scheduled so far this
year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to auction
house sale catalogs and websites.
