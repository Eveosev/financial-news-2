The U.K.’s opposition Labour Party
will call a parliamentary vote on leader  Ed Miliband ’s plan to
levy a tax on houses valued at more than 2 million pounds ($3.1
million), in an effort to embarrass Liberal Democrat ministers.  The Liberal Democrats, the junior partners in Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s coalition, have advocated such a
“mansion tax” as a key policy, arguing that it could help
discourage investment in property and would also raise money
from the wealthy.  Cameron’s Conservatives oppose more property taxes. That
means Liberal Democrat lawmakers might be obliged to vote
against the plan. The vote wouldn’t in any case be binding on
the government.  “The Lib Dems say they are in favor of a mansion tax,”
Miliband will say, according to his office, on a visit to the
southern English town of Eastleigh today, where voters will
elect a new lawmaker on Feb. 28. “Or will the Liberal Democrats
do what they’ve done for 2 1/2 years: prop up a Tory Government
that is squeezing the living standards of the middle harder and
harder?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
