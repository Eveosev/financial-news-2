Forward  Chris Kreider  was recalled
by the New York Rangers one day after he was sent down to the
American Hockey League’s Connecticut Whale, General Manager  Glen Sather  said.  Kreider will be with the team today when the Rangers host
the Washington Capitals.  Kreider, 21, who had one shot on goal two nights ago in
Connecticut’s 4-1 victory over Portland, was demoted less than a
year after he became the first player in more than two decades
to win a college title and debut in that year’s National Hockey
League playoffs.  Kreider had a goal and an assist with four penalty minutes
in seven games for the Rangers this season. His five postseason
goals last year tied an NHL record for playoff scoring by a
rookie who hadn’t appeared in a regular-season game.  Kreider won the National Collegiate Athletic Association
championship with Boston College in April 2012 and then signed
with the Rangers, who selected him in the first round of the
2009 entry draft, in time to participate in the playoffs.  Kreider was the first player to jump from a college
championship to the NHL postseason since 1987, when Tony Hrkac
won a college title with the University of North Dakota before
playing for the St. Louis Blues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
