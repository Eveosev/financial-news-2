Peruvian President Ollanta Humala
said yesterday that he doesn’t believe there’s a kidnap threat
for U.S. tourists visiting the ruins of Machu Picchu, RPP
reported.  Humala, during a press conference, said the alert issued
Feb. 14 by the U.S. State Department, is “baseless,” the Lima-
based news website said. The U.S. agency has barred travel by
officials to Cuzco, where Machu Picchu is located, saying a
criminal organization may be planning to abduct U.S. tourists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
