Toshiba Corp . agreed to pay $13.5
million to settle a lawsuit accusing makers of picture tubes
used in televisions and computers of fixing prices, lawyers for
direct purchasers of the products said in a court filing.  Toshiba and other display tube makers were sued in 2007 in
federal court in San Francisco on claims they operated a cartel
from 1995 through 2007 to offset a drop in demand for cathode-
ray tubes caused by the introduction of more advanced liquid-
crystal and plasma-display technology, according to the lawsuit.  Toshiba denied wrongdoing, according to the settlement
agreement, filed yesterday in conjunction with a request for
preliminary approval of the accord.  The price fixing conspiracy stabilized tube prices when
they should have fallen, and caused buyers to pay more,
according to the lawsuit.  LG Electronics  agreed to pay $25
million to settled the claims, and other manufactures have also
agreed to settlements ranging from $10 million to $17 million,
Guido Saveri, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in
yesterday’s filing.  Julius Christensen, a Toshiba spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail yesterday seeking comment on the
settlement.  The case is In Re Cathode Ray Tube Antitrust Litigation,
07-5944, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
