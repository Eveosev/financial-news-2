Teenager Mikaela Shiffrin became the
youngest alpine skiing world champion in 28 years after winning
the women’s slalom today in Schladming, Austria.  Shiffrin, at 17 years, 340 days, was in third place after
the first run and finished with a combined time of 1 minute,
39.85 seconds. She beat Austria’s Michaela Kirchgasser by 0.22
seconds, with first-run leader Frida Hansdotter of Sweden a
further 0.04 seconds back in third.  Shiffrin was born in Vail, Colorado, and moved to New
Hampshire at the age of 8 when her father took a job as an
anesthesiologist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Her dad,
Jeff, who skied on Dartmouth’s team, acts as her manager.  “I haven’t yet realized what just happened,” Shiffrin
said on the  World Cup skiing  website. “In the first run I
wasn’t quite awake and aware of the situation. Two minutes
before the second run I felt I could win and I did.”  Shiffrin is the youngest world champion in any discipline
since American Diann Roffe-Steinrotter, who was 21 days younger
when she won the giant slalom in 1985. Only Hanni Wenzel of
Liechtenstein, at 17 years, 56 days in 1974, and Britain’s Esme
Mackinnon, at 17 years, 82 days, in 1931 were younger slalom
champions.  Shiffrin took the lead with a second run time of 49.26
seconds. She then had to wait for Poutiainen and Hansdotter to
ski, but neither could overtake the teenager.  The U.S. leads the gold medal standings with four, while
its five total medals are one behind host Austria. The
championships conclude tomorrow with the men’s slalom, where
American  Ted Ligety  goes for his fourth gold medal in
Schladming.  To contact the reporter on this story:
