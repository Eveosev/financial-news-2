China believes it can agree with the
European Union on ways to limit airline emissions without
relying on the emissions trading system, National Development
and Reform Commission vice chairman  Xie Zhenhua  said.  “We have lot of options besides the emissions trading
system to achieve emission targets in the aviation sector,” Xie
said in an interview in the south Indian port city of Chennai.
“For example, to save energy, improve energy efficiency, to
improve the level of management. All can work together and the
emission trading system can help.”  A United Nations meeting on climate change in Warsaw at the
end of this year is important because it will lay the basis for
future negotiations, Xie said.  “China will actively participate in the negotiation for
emission reduction and we do hope that through our joint efforts
we can achieve a result this year,” the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
