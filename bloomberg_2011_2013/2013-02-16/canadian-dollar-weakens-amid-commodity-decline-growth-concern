Canada’s dollar fell for a second
week against its U.S. counterpart as commodities declined and
concern increased that growth is slowing in the world’s 11th-
largest economy.  The currency slid versus 13 of its 16 most-traded peers as
manufacturing sales fell the most since 2009. The data followed
a report last week that showed an unexpected drop in jobs.
Canada’s dollar traded in the tightest range in a month versus
the greenback as crude oil, the nation’s biggest export, reached
a three-week low. The  inflation rate  slipped to the lowest in
more than three years, a report next week may say.  “Some of the data out of Canada has been weaker, and it’s
taken a bit of the shine off of the currency,”  Robert Lynch ,
head of currency strategy at HSBC Holdings Plc in New York, said
in a telephone interview. “The recent data has created headwinds
for the currency that didn’t previously exist.”  The Canadian dollar, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.4 percent to
C$1.0064 per U.S. dollar this week in Toronto. It touched
C$1.0082, approaching the C$1.0100 level it reached last month,
the weakest since July 27. One Canadian dollar purchases 99.36
U.S. cents.  The loonie traded between C$1 and C$1.0087, the narrowest
weekly range since Jan. 11. It remained below its 200-day moving
average throughout the week. The average was 99.91 Canadian
cents yesterday.  Bets Reduced  Hedge funds and other large speculators decreased bets for
a fourth straight week that the Canadian dollar will gain
against the greenback, reducing them to the lowest since August,
figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission show. The difference in the number of wagers on an
advance in the loonie compared with those on a drop -- so-called
net longs -- was 26,565 on Feb. 12, compared with 27,761 the
week before.  Canada’s government bonds fell, pushing the yield on
benchmark 10-year debt up six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 2.01 percent. The price of the 2.75 percent security
maturing in June 2022 declined 53 cents to C$106.20.  The Bank of Canada sold C$3.3 billion ($3.3 billion) of
two-year notes at an average yield of 1.168 percent on Feb. 13.
The one percent securities are due in May 2015. The offering
drew C$8.5 billion in bids.  The central bank said it will auction C$400 million of
real-return bonds on Feb. 20. The inflation-linked debt matures
in 2044. At its last RRB auction on Dec. 5, the BOC sold C$700
million of 30-year bonds at a median yield of 0.3 percent.  Manufacturing Sales  The loonie weakened yesterday after  factory sales  in
December fell more than forecast. They sank 3.1 percent to C$48
billion, from C$49.6 billion the previous month, Statistics
Canada said Friday in Ottawa. The decline was larger than the
most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 17
economists that had a median estimate of a 0.8 percent decline.  “The data was quite a bit softer than expected, and it
painted a sluggish picture of the Canadian economy for the
latter part of last year,”  Shaun Osborne , chief currency
strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities, said
yesterday in a telephone interview from Toronto. “It reaffirms
the low-for-longer outlook for interest rates.”  Employment unexpectedly fell in January for the first time
in six months, decreasing by 21,900 jobs, Statistics Canada data
showed on Feb. 8. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had
projected a 5,000-job increase.  Rate Outlook  Bank of Governor Mark Carney reiterated to lawmakers this
week in Ottawa that an increase in the benchmark  interest rate ,
which has been 1 percent since 2010 to spur growth, is less
urgent because inflation has been slower than forecast and will
stay below the 2 percent target rate through mid-2014. The bank
pared its 2013 growth forecast last month to 2 percent, from a
2.3 percent estimate in October.  The consumer price index advanced 0.7 percent in January
from a year earlier, economists in a Bloomberg News survey
forecast before the government reports the data on Feb. 22. It
was 0.8 percent in  December , the lowest since October 2009.  The Canadian dollar fell this week as Standard & Poor’s
 GSCI Index  of 24 raw commodities declined 0.3 percent. Crude oil
for March delivery touched $94.97 a barrel in New York on Feb.
11, the lowest since Jan. 23.     Raw materials including oil
account for almost half of Canada’s export revenue.  G-20 Meeting  The loonie weakened against the euro, losing 0.4 percent to
C$1.3445, as Group-of-20 finance ministers and central bankers
met in Moscow. The group will urge members to avoid devaluations
and to let their exchange rates be set by markets, a G-20
official said.  “The Canadian dollar is very much on the sidelines of the
broader debates which are going around markets right now, which
is the currency-war theme,”  Jane Foley , senior currency
strategist at Rabobank International, said Feb. 12 by phone from
London. “Whether or not Canada can win back some ground, that’s
definitely a potential, but not until the Bank of Canada drops
its more dovish tone.”  Canada’s dollar has fallen 0.9 percent this year among the
10 developed-nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. dollar rose 0.7 percent,
and the euro climbed 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
