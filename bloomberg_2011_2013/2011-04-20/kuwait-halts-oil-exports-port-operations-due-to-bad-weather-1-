Kuwait, OPEC’s fifth-biggest oil
producer, temporarily halted all crude exports and port
operations because of low visibility caused by a sandstorm,
officials said today.  “Oil exports were suspended this morning, until the
weather improves,” Mohammed al-Ajmi, a spokesman for state-
refiner Kuwait National Petroleum Co., said today by telephone.
Kuwait routinely halts oil exports during bad weather.  It is the fourth sandstorm in as many weeks to hit the
country, which on April 13 halted all crude exports, closed
schools and suspended flights till the dust subsided.  All marine operations were also halted, the state news
agency  KUNA  reported, citing the Kuwait Ports Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
