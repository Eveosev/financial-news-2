India ’s 11-year bonds declined,
pushing yields to a two-month high, on speculation accelerating
inflation will prompt the central bank to raise borrowing costs.  The wholesale price index rose 8.98 percent in March from a
year earlier, compared with 8.31 percent in February, according
to official data last week. A 20 percent gain in the price of
oil this year has pushed up import costs for  Asia ’s second-
largest economy, which produces about a quarter of the crude it
uses. The Reserve Bank of India has lifted its benchmark rate by
two percentage points to 6.75 percent since the beginning of
last year and its next review is due May 3.  “Inflation has been the main concern for a long time
now,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at Development
Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “With  oil prices  also staying high,
another rate hike is in the offing.”  The yield on the 8.08 percent note due August 2022 rose two
basis points to 8.26 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate is the
highest level since Feb. 8. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  India sold 60 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) of 70-day cash
management bills at an auction, the  Reserve Bank  of India said
in an e-mailed statement today. It will sell 60 billion rupees
of similar bills maturing in 49 days tomorrow.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose two basis points to 7.79 percent, the highest level since
October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
