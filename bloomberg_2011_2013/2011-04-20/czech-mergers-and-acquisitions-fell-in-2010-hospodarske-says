The total volume of mergers and
acquisitions involving Czech companies fell 66 percent last year
to $2.1 billion, according to a study conducted by Ernst &
Young,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported.  Foreign investors remain wary of an unstable political
situation in the country and its unclear regulatory and tax
environment, the newspaper said.  The volume peaked at $8.7 billion in 2007, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
