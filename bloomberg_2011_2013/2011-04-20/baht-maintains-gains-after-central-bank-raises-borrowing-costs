Thailand â€™s baht held advances after
the central bank raised borrowing costs for a third time this
year.  The Bank of Thailand increased the one-day bond repurchase
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.75 percent as
predicted by all of 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The baht rose 0.1 percent to 30.03 per dollar as of 2:33
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
