Sumant Sinha, former chief
operating officer of  India ’s largest wind-turbine maker  Suzlon
Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , may develop wind projects with his old company and
with Germany’s  Kenersys GmbH  and Regen Powertech Pvt.  Sinha, who left Suzlon last May, has started a new company,
ReNew Power Pvt., which plans to set up wind farms and solar
power plants in India.  ReNew has signed agreements with Suzlon, Kenersys and Regen
Powertech to identify sites and develop farms, Sinha said in a
phone interview from Mumbai. ReNew has arranged some financing
and may seek to raise more funds later this year, Sinha said,
declining to elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
