Natural gas shipments to U.S.  power
plants  climbed for a third day on forecasts of above-normal
temperatures that may boost air-conditioning demand. Shipments
to Texas rose for a fifth day.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to power generators in the
U.S. and Canada was up 0.2 percent to 15.1 million dekatherms
(14.7 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg as of 9:40 a.m. in New York.  Power plants in Texas were to receive 1.74 million
dekatherms of gas, 17 percent more than yesterday, Bloomberg
data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences declined 3 percent
to 27.7 million dekatherms.  The high temperature in El Paso, Texas, tomorrow may be 88
degrees Fahrenheit (31 Celsius), 8 above normal, according to
 Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan.  Natural gas at the El Paso Permian hub, where the fuel is
delivered into the Southwest from Texas, rose 1.46 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $4.0494 per million British thermal units yesterday
on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
dropped 3.92 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $4.1938 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
