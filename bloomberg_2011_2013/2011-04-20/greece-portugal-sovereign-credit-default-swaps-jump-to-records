The cost of insuring debt sold by
 Greece  and  Portugal  rose to records, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on Greece jumped 62 basis points to 1,303 basis
points according to closing prices in London, signaling a 67
percent chance of default within five years. Portugal climbed 24
basis points to 636.  That helped push the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe
Index of swaps on 15 governments 2 basis points higher to 189,
the highest in three weeks. The gauge is up from 157.5 basis
points April 8, the lowest in five months.  Contracts on Ireland increased 28 basis points to 623,
while Italy was unchanged at 149 and  Spain  rose 1.5 to 243, CMA
prices show. An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of
 credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers fell 1.5 basis points to 132, and the
subordinated index was also 1.5 lower at 234, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 8 basis points to 365 and
the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings fell 2 to 98.75, JPMorgan prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($14.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
