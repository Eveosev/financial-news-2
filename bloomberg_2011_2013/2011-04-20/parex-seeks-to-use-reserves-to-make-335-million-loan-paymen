Parex Banka AS asked Latvia’s
central bank and bank regulator for permission to use mandatory
reserves to make the final payment on a syndicated loan.  Parex, which no longer gives loans and holds non-performing
assets, must repay 164 million lati ($335 million) by May 5, the
final installment of a loan that was rescheduled after the bank
was taken over by the state in 2008. The bank is asking
authorities to release 26 million lati in reserves held at the
central bank for the payment, Parex said today in a statement.  Latvia turned to a group led by the European Commission and
the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.9
billion) bailout after Parex failed. The government split Parex
into an  asset management company  and created a new retail bank
called Citadele Banka AS in preparation for the sale of both.  “Our mandatory reserves are calculated and accumulated
largely on the basis of the bank’s liabilities toward the
investments made by the Ministry of Finance and repayment of the
syndicated loan,” Chairman Christopher Gwilliam said today in
the statement to the Riga Stock Exchange. “Therefore the use of
these funds for repaying the loan is a logical step.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
