Ireland should sell parts of state-
owned utility companies Electricity Supply Board and Bord Gais
to help it cut mounting debt, according to a government-
commissioned report.  The ESB’s energy supply business and Bord Gais non-
transmission operations should be sold and the government should
sell its shares in  Aer Lingus (AERL)  Group Plc as “soon as
opportune,” according to the report, written by economist Colm McCarthy, who was hired in July by the previous government to
review of state assets. The assets recommended for sale have a
net value of 5 billion euros, the report said.  Ireland’s new government, established last month, committed
to the sale of 2 billion euros of “non-strategic” state assets
as public debt mounts amid a slump in tax revenues and rising
bank-bailout costs, after the collapse of a real-estate boom.
The country’s solvency is “fragile,” said  Fitch Ratings  on
April 18, as it forecast national debt may rise to 116 percent
of gross domestic product in 2013 to 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
