Bank of Italy Governor  Mario Draghi 
is a “qualified candidate” to replace Jean-Claude Trichet at
the helm of the European Central Bank, former Bundesbank
President Hans Tietmeyer said.  “I know him very well,” Tietmeyer said in a Bloomberg
Television interview at an event hosted by the Official Monetary
and Financial Institutions Forum in  London  today. “I like him.
He’s a qualified candidate.”  The resignation of Bundesbank President  Axel Weber ,
previously tipped by economists as the frontrunner to succeed
Trichet, opened up the race for the ECB’s top job to candidates
from Draghi to Luxembourg’s  Yves Mersch , Erkki Liikanen of
Finland and Nout Wellink of the Netherlands.  “I will not comment on the candidates,” Tietmeyer said,
when asked who he would prefer to get the position. “It’s not
my decision and not my job to make a comment.”  Whether Draghi wins the ECB job depends on politicians who
are struggling to persuade their electorates to back financial
aid for debt-strapped nations on the euro region’s periphery.
 Greece  has yet to convince investors it can pay its debts almost
a year after it was rescued amid growing speculation the country
will need to restructure.  “I don’t see a likelihood of a Greece default, but it
depends very much on what the Greek policy will do in reality,”
Tietmeyer said. “They have to address their problems in an
appropriate way.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
