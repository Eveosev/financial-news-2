Crude oil surged the most in a
month as climbing stocks increased optimism the economic
recovery is accelerating, and the dollar tumbled, bolstering
investor demand for commodities.  Oil rose 2.9 percent as the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
advanced to the highest level since June 2008 after sales at
companies from  Intel Corp . to Yahoo! Inc. beat projections. The
U.S. currency’s drop sent gold to a record and silver to a 31-
year high. Futures extended gains after the Energy Department
reported an unexpected decline in crude supplies.  “The stock market is a leading economic indicator, so it
shouldn’t be a surprise that oil is up as well,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank AG in
 Washington . “If the stock market is higher, there’s a good
chance that oil demand will be up as well.”  Crude oil for June delivery climbed $3.17 to settle at
$111.45 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the
biggest increase since March 17. Prices are up 34 percent from a
year ago.  Brent crude oil for June settlement rose $2.52, or 2.1
percent, to end the session at $123.85 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest settlement
since April 11.  Supplies of crude oil fell 2.32 million barrels to 357
million last week, the first drop since February, the Energy
Department said today in a weekly report. Inventories were
forecast to increase by 1.3 million barrels, according to the
median of 13 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Fuel Stockpiles  Inventories of gasoline dropped 1.58 million barrels to
208.1 million, the lowest level since the week ended Nov. 12,
the report showed. Stockpiles were forecast to decline by 1.75
million barrels, according to the survey. Demand for the motor
fuel was little changed at 8.99 million barrels a day over the
past four weeks, 1.8 percent lower than a year earlier.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 4.42 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $3.2773 a gallon in  New York , the highest settlement price
since July 16, 2008.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 0.2 cent to $3.837 a gallon yesterday, the highest
level since Sept. 16, 2008, the AAA said on its  website .  “The market is rising on perceptions about the strength of
demand, which are based on the stock market,” said  Tim Evans ,
an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.
“This distracts attention from the actual strength of demand.
Gasoline consumption remains lower than a year ago.”  The Dow climbed 179.3 points to 12,446.05, and the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index advanced 1.2 percent to 1,328.74 at 3:25 p.m.  Dollar Slump  “The dollar continues to weaken and we’re getting strong
corporate earnings, which is sending oil higher,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The recent high for the June contract
was $114.05 on April 11 and that’s got to be our next target.”  The dollar fell as much as 1.5 percent to $1.4548 per euro,
the lowest level since January 2010. The Dollar Index, a measure
of the currency versus those of six U.S. trading partners, slid
as much as 1 percent to 74.272, the lowest level since Dec. 1,
2009. A drop in the dollar makes commodities priced in the
currency more attractive for investors.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
climbed 1.3 percent to 365.53. Gold for June delivery rose
$3.80, or 0.3 percent, to $1,498.90 an ounce on the Comex in New
York. It was a record settlement price for the precious metal.  “The dollar is getting hammered again and all the
commodities are flying,” said Todd Horwitz, chief strategist at
Adam Mesh Trading Group in New York. “The falling dollar and
inventories as well as the outlook for increasing demand are
pushing the oil market higher.”  Middle East Unrest  Oil has advanced 22 percent in New York this year. Unrest
in the Middle East and North  Africa  has toppled leaders in Egypt
and Tunisia and spread to  Libya , Algeria,  Bahrain ,  Iran , Oman,
Syria and Yemen. Libyan crude-oil output, which averaged 1.6
million barrels a day last year, fell to 390,000 barrels a day
in March, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  At least 153 people died in riots across northern  Nigeria 
by supporters of opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari, who lost
the April 16 presidential vote in Africa’s top oil-producing
country, a civil rights group said. Attacks by armed groups cut
more than 28 percent of the country’s oil output between 2006
and 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  “The post-election violence in Nigeria is adding to the
fear factor that’s helped drive prices higher this year,” said
Sean Brodrick, a natural resource analyst with  Weiss Research  in
Jupiter,  Florida .  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 462,412
contracts as of 3:14 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 557,023
contracts yesterday, 29 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.54 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
