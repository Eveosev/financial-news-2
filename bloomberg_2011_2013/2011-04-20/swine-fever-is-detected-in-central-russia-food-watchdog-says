Russia registered a new outbreak of
African swine fever in the central Nizhny Novgorod region, food-
safety watchdog  Rosselkhoznadzor  said.  The virus was found in the bodies of dead and ill pigs at a
private farm with 28 animals in the village of Mulino, Moscow-
based Rosselkhoznadzor said in an e-mailed statement today.  About 17,000 pigs have died or been slaughtered this year
in Russia because of the disease, on top of 60,000 last year,
Nikolai Vlasov, Rosselkhoznadzorâ€™s deputy chief, said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
