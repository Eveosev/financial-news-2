Treasuries declined for the first
time in four days as investors sought higher-yielding assets,
sending stocks up, while traders pared bets the  Federal Reserve 
will raise borrowing costs by early next year.  Thirty-year bond yields rose from the lowest level in more
than three weeks as a gauge of traders’ expectations for
consumer prices was at almost the highest since March 2008. Gold
climbed to a record as investors sought to guard against
inflation. The U.S. will sell $99 billion in notes next week,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “Stocks are rallying and people are taking money out of
the bond market,” said  Charles Comiskey , New York-based head of
Treasury trading at Bank of Nova Scotia. “It’s easy money for a
long time creating a bid for commodities and stocks. It feels as
though the Fed is going to stay on hold for another year.”  Yields on 10-year notes increased five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 3.41 percent at 5:01 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.625 percent
note due in February 2021 dropped 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 25/32.  Two-year note yields rose two basis points to 0.66 percent
after reaching 0.64 percent yesterday, the lowest level since
March 24. Thirty-year bond yields increased three basis points
to 4.47 percent after touching 4.42 percent yesterday, the
lowest since March 23.  Rate Wagers  The likelihood policy makers will raise the target rate for
overnight lending between banks at their March meeting declined
to 46 percent, from 55 percent a week ago, Fed funds futures
showed. The Fed has kept the benchmark at zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008, and all 74 economists in a Bloomberg survey
expect policy makers to keep it there at an April 27 meeting.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 1.5 percent to
12,453.54, its highest closing level since June 2008, and the
MSCI World Index climbed 2 percent.  The dollar sank to a 16-month low against the currencies of
major U.S. trading partners as the stock rally damped demand for
refuge. IntercontinentalExchange’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against six currencies including the euro and yen,
touched 74.272, the lowest since December 2009.  “For the day, risk is on,” said  George Goncalves , New
York-based head of interest rate strategy at Nomura Holdings
Inc., one of 20 primary dealers that trade directly with the
Fed. “It’s all about stocks.”  Treasuries slipped amid lower-than-average volume as a
holiday weekend approached. The Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association  recommends  that trading in U.S.,
U.K. and Japanese financial markets cease at 2 p.m. New York
time tomorrow and remain closed the following day for the Easter
weekend.  ‘Quiet Market’  About $219 billion of Treasuries were traded today as of
5:01 p.m., the least since April 11, according to Icap Plc, the
world’s largest interdealer broker. About $242 billion changed
hands yesterday. The full-day average this year is $329 billion.  “It’s a quiet market,” said Theodore Ake, head of
Treasury trading at the primary dealer  Societe Generale  in New
York. “We have a holiday-shortened week and a strong stock
market. Over the next three to four trading sessions, 3.45
percent to 3.33 percent is where we will be doing 90 percent of
our trading.”  The 10-year note yield will rise to 3.91 percent by year-
end, according to the average forecast of 75 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey, with the most recent forecasts given the
heaviest ratings.  Break-Even Rate  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, widened to as
much as 2.66 percentage points. The spread, known as the break-
even rate, touched 2.67 percentage points on April 11, the most
in three years.  The 10-year break-even rate reached 2.74 percent in 2006
and averaged 2.35 percent in the five years through December
2007, when the U.S. recession began.  A  bond market  measure of inflation expectations the Fed
uses to help determine monetary policy increased to 3.13
percentage points, from 2.82 percentage points on March 23. It
reached a 10-month high of 3.28 percent in December. The five-
year, five-year forward break-even rate projects what the pace
of consumer price increases may be beginning in 2016. It
averaged 2.78 percentage points over the past five years.  Gold rose above $1,500 an ounce to a record in  London  and
New York as concern inflation will accelerate spurred demand for
an alternative investment.  Fed Purchase  The central bank  bought  $1.5 billion of TIPS maturing from
July 2020 to February 2041 today as part of its plan to acquire
$600 billion of  U.S. debt  through June to spur economic growth.  The U.S. will sell $35 billion in two-year notes, $35
billion in five-year debt and $29 billion in seven-year
securities next week, according to the average forecast of nine
primary dealers in a Bloomberg survey. It would be the seventh
straight month the amounts have been the same. The Treasury
Department will announce auction details tomorrow.  Treasuries gained yesterday amid speculation any agreement
in Congress to curb the nation’s budget deficit will impede
economic growth.  S&P lowered the U.S. credit-rating outlook this week to
negative, citing the widening budget deficit. Treasury Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner  said yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg
Television that he’s confident U.S. political leaders will
bridge differences on spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
