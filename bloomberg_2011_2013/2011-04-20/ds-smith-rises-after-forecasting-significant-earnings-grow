DS Smith Plc (SMDS) , owner of the Spicers
office-products brand, rose the most since December after
forecasting “significant” full-year earnings per share growth.  Corrugated packaging operations have experienced underlying
volume growth of about 8 percent for the year ending April 30,
the London-based company said in a statement. The stock gained
6.8 percent.  DS Smith, which collects boxes from supermarkets including
 J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY) , is looking to focus on supplying recycled
packaging. It’s uniting its U.K. and French packaging businesses
under the DS Smith name to focus marketing and sales efforts.  “We’ve had a very strong last few months, and we’re on
track to deliver significant earnings per share growth,” Chief
Executive Officer Miles Roberts said in a telephone interview.  Planning approval for a proposed 350 million-pound waste-
to-energy plant is “progressing extremely well,” Roberts said.
The plant, a venture with  E.ON AG (EOAN)  and Wheelabrator Technologies
Inc., would supply electricity to DS Smith’s existing paper mill
in Kemsley, outside  London .  The company wants the new plant to be running within five
years, Roberts said.  The shares climbed 13.5 pence, or 6.8 percent, to 211 pence
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The shares have gained 4.4
percent so far this year, giving it a market value of 919
million pounds ($1.5 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
