Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) , the largest publicly traded copper producer, said it will
pay a one-time 50-cent-a-share dividend and raised its 2011
sales forecast as the industrial metal traded close to a record.  First-quarter net income climbed 67 percent to $1.5
billion, or $1.57 a share, from $897 million, or $1, a year
earlier, the Phoenix-based company said today in a statement.
That beat the $1.35 average estimate of two analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Sales gained 31 percent to $5.71 billion from
$4.36 billion. Freeport rose as much as 6.2 percent in New York
trading, the most in five months.  Freeport, which operates mines in the U.S.,  Africa  and
 Indonesia , forecast full-year copper sales of 3.9 billion pounds
and gold sales of 1.6 million ounces, up from its prediction in
January of 3.85 billion pounds and 1.4 million ounces
respectively.  Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson is moving to
counter falling output by resuming operations suspended during
the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. Freeport said today it’s
restarting its Chino copper mine in  New Mexico  and has begun
mining at the Miami project in  Arizona .  “These results highlight Freeport’s very strong asset
base,” David Radclyffe, a London-based mining and metals
analyst at BMO Capital Markets who has an “outperform”
recommendation on the shares, said in an interview. “Strong and
robust cash flows are dramatically changing this company,
allowing it to reward shareholders.”  Gold Ore  Increased gold production from higher-grade ore in the
open-pit section of Freeport’s Grasberg mine in Indonesia also
buoyed profit, the company said. Freeport is continuing with
plans to begin underground mining at Grasberg to extend the
economic life of the mine.  The supplemental dividend of 50 cents, which was declared
in addition to Freeport’s regular 25-cent quarterly payout, will
be paid June 1, the company said.  Adkerson reiterated that Freeport is focused on expanding
its metals output through its own exploration and development
projects, while not ruling out acquisitions.  “If an attractive acquisition came to us, we are
financially and technically available,” Adkerson said today on
a conference call with analysts and investors. “We don’t expect
it. It’s not part of our strategy.”  Copper for delivery in three months on the  London  Metal
Exchange averaged $9,629 a metric ton in the first quarter, 32
percent more than a year earlier. It was 2.3 percent higher at
$9,555 a ton as of 4:38 p.m. in London. Copper traded at a
record $10,190 on Feb. 15.  Freeport rose $1.58, or 3.1 percent, to $53.30 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
climbed 32 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
