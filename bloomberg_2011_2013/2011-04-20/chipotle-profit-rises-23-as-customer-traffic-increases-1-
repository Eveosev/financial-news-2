Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) , the
burrito chain spun off from McDonald’s Corp. in 2006, reported a
23 percent gain in first-quarter profit as consumers dined out
more.  Net income rose to $46.4 million, or $1.46 a share, from
$37.8 million, or $1.19, a year earlier, the Denver-based
company said in a statement today. Analysts projected $1.43, the
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Chipotle’s operating margin fell 90 basis points to 25.2
percent in the quarter because of higher food costs, according
to the statement. The burrito chain joins restaurants including
Yum! Brands Inc.,  Cheesecake Factory Inc. (CAKE)  and  BJ’s Restaurants
Inc. (BJRI)  in reporting results today. All face surging costs for
ingredients such as beef, eggs and milk, which have forced some
chains to raise prices.  “It’s really a produce issue,” said Steve West, an
analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in  St. Louis . There was a
freeze in Mexico and Argentina that hurt fruit and vegetable
crops, including avocados and tomatoes, he said. West advises
buying the shares.  Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum said first-quarter profit
rose 9.5 percent to $264 million, or 54 cents a share, compared
with a year earlier. The company operates the Taco Bell and KFC
chains, with more than 37,000 locations worldwide. Calabasas
Hills, California-based Cheesecake Factory, which has about 160
U.S. restaurants, posted a 9.6 percent gain in profit for the
first quarter.  Labor Issue  Chipotle fell $9.10 to $279 at 5:42 p.m. in late New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares closed up $8.25, or
2.9 percent, at $288.10 today and have gained 35 percent this
year.  Yum rose $3.15, or 6.1 percent, to $54.70 in  New York .
Cheesecake Factory fell $1.01, or 3.3 percent, to $29.59 on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, after closing up 2.5 percent.  Chipotle is now working with the criminal division of the
U.S. Attorney’s office in  Washington , in addition to U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to provide them with
certain documents as a part of a review, co-Chief Executive
Officer Montgomery Moran said on a conference call today. The
company had to fire about 450 workers when an immigration
investigation began in  Minnesota  earlier this year.  "A lot of noise is being made about this investigation,"
West said. "There is risk because we don’t know what the final
outcome is going to be."  Chipotle sales rose 24 percent to $509 million in the three
months ended March 31, the company said. Revenue was $410
million in the year-ago quarter.  There are about 1,100 Chipotle stores in the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
