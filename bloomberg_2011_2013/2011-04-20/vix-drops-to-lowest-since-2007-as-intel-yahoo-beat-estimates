The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options slumped to its lowest intraday level since June 2007 as
shares rallied on better-than-estimated quarterly reports from
companies including  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and Yahoo! Inc.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, decreased 8.9 percent to 14.55 at 9:40 a.m. in
New York. The index measures the cost of using options as
insurance against declines in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
which added 1.3 percent.  May VIX futures fell 3.4 percent to 18.45 while July
contracts slumped 2.1 percent to 21.45. The biggest advance
among all VIX options was on the May 15 puts, which rose to 10
cents from 5 cents. This year’s lowest VIX close before today
was 15.32 on April 15. The gauge has averaged 20.37 in its two-
decade history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
