The shekel rose the most in a week
against the dollar on concern about the ability of the U.S. to
deal with its debt burden and before a decision on  interest
rates  as the Bank of  Israel  seeks to tame rising prices.  The U.S. government risks losing its AAA credit rating
unless policy makers agree on a plan by 2013 to trim budget
deficits,  Standard & Poor’s  said April 18 as it lowered its U.S.
outlook to negative from stable. The dollar fell against 15 of
16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The U.S. currency is weakening a little around the world
on concern about how the U.S. will deal with its deficit and
high inflation,” Adiv Kabiri, senior currency dealer at Gift
Asset Management Ltd. in Tel Aviv said by telephone. “The
shekel is keeping its strong momentum as investors are awaiting
the rate decision next week.”  The Israeli currency advanced as much as 0.8 percent to
3.4099 per dollar and was trading at 3.4146 as of 4:44 p.m. in
 Tel Aviv . The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020
rose, pushing the yield on the 5 percent note down 1 basis point
to 5.25 percent at the 2:45 p.m. close.  The  Bank of Israel  will leave the rate at 3 percent when it
announces its next decision April 24, according to 11 of 17
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Six predict a quarter
percentage point increase to 3.25 percent. Consumer prices are
expected to rise 3.1 percent in the next 12 months, according to
the average of forecasters surveyed by the central bank,
released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
