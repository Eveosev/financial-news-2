OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest
gas producer, plans to start exploration for the fuel in
 Bangladesh  this year as the Asian country aims to expand output
to meet rising demand.  Bangladesh asked Gazprom to help drill exploration and
production wells and build gas compressor stations, Gazprom
International, a unit of the Russian gas exporter, said in an e-
mailed statement after Managing Director Valery Gulev visited
Bangladesh today. Gazprom and Petrobangla, the state energy
company, may from a joint venture, according to the statement.  “Drilling may begin as early as this fall if work
progresses well,” Gulev said, according to the statement.  Bangladesh increased both production and consumption of gas
