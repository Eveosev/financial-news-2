Dutch sugar-beet planting was
completed by April 18, the fastest pace in at least eight years,
after a “very early” start to sowing, national beet researcher
IRS said.  “Exceptionally nice weather with sufficiently high
temperatures and the occasional shower” meant a good start for
the earliest-sown beets, Bergen op Zoom, Netherlands-based IRS
said in a  report  on its website yesterday.  The advanced stage of vegetation development for the beets
means an “excellent starting position” for high sugar
production, according to the researcher. At the same time last
year planting was 90 percent complete,  IRS data  shows.  A key indicator marking the start of beet development is
when the roots on average contain 4 grams (0.14 ounce) of sugar.
That point is expected to be reached on June 7, two weeks ahead
of the 10-year average, IRS said. Earlier beet sowing and
development can boost sugar yields.  The Netherlands is the European Union’s fifth-largest
sugar-beet grower after  France ,  Germany , the U.K. and  Poland ,
according to  data  from the bloc’s statistical office Eurostat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
