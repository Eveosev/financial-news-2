Commercial International Bank Egypt
SAE (COMI)  led declines among Egyptian banks after Moody’s Investors
Service revised its outlook to “negative” for the industry,
citing “elevated political uncertainty.”  Commercial International, the nation’s biggest publicly
traded lender, lost 4.4 percent to 27.37 Egyptian pounds, the
lowest level since December 2009. Credit Agricole Egypt
retreated 1.7 percent to 10.73 pounds, its lowest level in more
than three weeks. All 10 bank stocks traded in Egypt declined.
The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  fell 1.9 percent.  “We can’t expect these banks to be as profitable as last
year,” said Ryan Ayache, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in
Dubai, who expects up to a 15 percent decline in profits for
Egyptian banks. “Profitability is critical but it’s not
everything. Other things we’ll be looking at include asset
quality, capital position and liquidity, which we expect to be
relatively resilient.”  Moody’s yesterday lowered its outlook for the Egyptian
banking industry in the next 12 to 18 months from “stable,” as
the profitability of Egyptian banks is expected to come “under
pressure.”  Egypt ’s economic growth may slow to 2 percent over that
period and there’s increased “risk involved in an orderly
transition toward democratic rule,” Limassol, Cyprus-based
analyst Nondas Nicolaides wrote in a research note yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
