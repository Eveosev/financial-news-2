Eurus Energy Holdings Corp., a unit
of Tokyo Electric Power Co., has completed a 30-megawatt wind
farm in southern  Japan .  The new farm on the Osumi peninsula in Kagoshima prefecture
with 15 windmills made by Japan Steel Works Ltd. started
operations on March 18, the Tokyo-based company said today in an
e-mailed statement.  The announcement comes as the parent company, known as
TEPCO, tries to bring a damaged nuclear plant under control five
weeks after a deadly quake and tsunami to the north and amid
public concerns about possible power outages.  The latest addition will bring the company’s total wind
power generation capacity to more than 2 gigawatts, according to
Mitsue Usami, a spokeswoman for Japan’s biggest wind farm
operator. Outside Japan, Eurus Energy operates farms in  South
Korea , the  United States  and  Europe .  To contact the reporters on this story:
