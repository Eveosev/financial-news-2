Computacenter Plc (CCC) , a supplier of
computer services to  BT Group Plc (BT/A) , said its performance will
meet management forecasts this year because of “solid” growth
in its services unit.  Group revenue rose 2 percent in the first quarter while
services revenue grew 6 percent in the period, the Hatfield,
England-based company said in a Regulatory News Service
statement today.  “We remain confident that 2011, as a whole, will be
another year of improvement for Computacenter’s performance,”
the company said in the statement. “While much remains to be
done, we are trading in line with management expectations for
the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
