RWE AG (RWE)  said the German government’s
decision to give federal states veto rights in the
implementation of carbon capture and storage, or CCS, facilities
will hinder the technology in the country.  “CCS won’t be able to help here in Germany,”  Juergen Grossmann , RWE’s chief executive officer, said in a copy of a
speech to be delivered to shareholders at their annual meeting
in the German city of Essen today. “There’s no more effective
way to stop CCS in Germany” than the veto right.  The proposed legislation sets federal rules for carbon-
capture projects while allowing state governments to pass laws
that bar carbon capture in their territory. RWE is Germany’s
second-largest utility.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
