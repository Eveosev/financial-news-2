Standard & Poor’s Financial
Services LLC, a unit of  McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) , can’t be sued in
 Frankfurt  over its ratings of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a
German court ruled.  A German pensioner seeking compensation for 30,000 euros
($43,500) he lost investing in Lehman certificates had his suit
turned away today, Frankfurt court spokesman Arne Hasse said in
an interview, because the tribunal doesn’t have jurisdiction to
decide the case. The suit claimed S&P’s A+ rating for the
securities in May 2008 was misleading.  Rating companies have come under fire for their alleged
failure to foresee the financial crisis and for granting top
rankings to mortgage bonds that fell in value after home-loan
defaults. Investors brought cases in  Germany  after a U.S. court
ruled the ratings companies can’t be held liable because their
ratings are protected speech.  A different chamber of the Frankfurt court last month sent
another case against S&P to a Munich tribunal, saying that court
may have jurisdiction because the firm owns a trademark
registered with the German trademark office based in that city.  The judges in March rejected a similar suit against  Moody’s
Corp. (MCO)  saying the New York-based company couldn’t be sued in
Frankfurt. That case is now on appeal.  Today’s case is: LG Frankfurt, 2-13 O 111/10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
