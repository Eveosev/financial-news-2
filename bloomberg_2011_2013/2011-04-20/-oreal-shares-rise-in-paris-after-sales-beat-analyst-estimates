L’Oreal SA (OR)  advanced in Paris
trading after the world’s largest cosmetics-maker reported
first-quarter sales that beat analysts’ estimates and said it
expects to outperform the global market in 2011.  The stock climbed as much as 2.68 euros, or 3.2 percent, to
85.88 euros. L’Oreal has risen about 3 percent this year,
valuing the maker of Garnier shampoo at 51.6 billion euros ($74
billion).  Revenue climbed 9.3 percent to 5.16 billion euros, the
Paris-based company said yesterday in a statement. The average
estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for sales of
5.03 billion euros. Excluding acquisitions and currency shifts,
revenue rose 5.8 percent. Sales from  North America  rose 12
percent.  “North America was the star performer,” Simon Marshall- Lockyer, an analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a note after the
release. He said the quarter was a “blowout” and a “strong
omen for 2011.”  L’Oreal said it’s confident of outperforming the global
cosmetics market, which it now expects to grow at the top end of
a February estimate of 3 percent to 4 percent in 2011.  “Given market growth and L’Oreal’s outperformance so far,
L’Oreal should be able to grow solidly in the 5 percent to 6
percent range in 2011,”  Andrew Wood , an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, wrote today in a note. He has an “underperform”
rating on the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
