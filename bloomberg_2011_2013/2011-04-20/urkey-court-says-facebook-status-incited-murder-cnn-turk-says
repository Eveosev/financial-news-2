A Turkish court ruled that a woman
who left her relationship status blank on Facebook provoked her
husband to murder her,  CNN Turk  reported.  A court in the eastern city of Malatya accepted defense
lawyers’ arguments that the murdered woman’s use of her maiden
name and not listing herself as married on the social networking
site qualified as “unjustified incitement,” CNN Turk said. The
ruling meant her husband’s jail term for the alleged killing in
February last year was reduced from life to 20 years, it said.  Kadime Sanli, 42, was found by her daughter after being
stabbed to death by her husband Huseyin Sanli, 48, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
