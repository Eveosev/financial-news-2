Guinea and mining companies will
discuss a new mining code during a conference and exhibition
from May 10 through May 12, general secretary at the Mining
Ministry Guillaume Curtis said.  The mining symposium will allow discussions on mining
policy and legal reform, Curtis told reporters at a press
conference in the capital Conakry yesterday. “Guinea will revise
agreements without exceptions to maximize its mining income,” he
added.   Companies including  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Hyperdynamics
Corp. (HDY)  and  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  are expected to attend, the minister
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
