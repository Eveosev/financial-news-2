Rangers Football Club Plc (RFC)  may get
an alternative offer from David King, a South Africa-based
businessman, the Herald newspaper said without saying where it
got the information.  Rangers is already in talks with Craig Whyte about a
possible takeover, the Glasgow-based newspaper said. The
Scottish soccer champions said yesterday that a board director
wanted the club to consider an alternative funding option. The
statement didn’t name King.  King may put up 25 million pounds to repay loans from
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and buy owner David Murray’s 93 percent
stake, the newspaper said.  The possibility of a second bidder is designed to disrupt
Whyte’s proposed transaction, the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified person close to Whyte.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
