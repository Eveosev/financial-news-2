Standard & Poor’s  created low-
volatility and high-sensitivity subindexes of components in the
 S&P 500 , the benchmark gauge of U.S. stocks, S&P said.  The S&P Low Volatility Index comprises the 100 least-
volatile stocks in the gauge in which constituents are weighted
based on the inverse of their volatility, while the S&P 500 High
Beta Index tracks the 100 shares most sensitive to market
returns where weighting is proportionate with market
sensitivity, or beta, S&P said in a press release today.  Both indexes have been licensed to  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) ’s
PowerShares unit and will eventually serve as the basis for
exchange-traded funds, S&P said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
