The pound slipped against the euro
for a second day before the  Bank of England  publishes the
minutes of its last meeting that may show policy makers remain
split over whether to raise  interest rates .  Britain’s currency strengthened versus the dollar. The
bank’s Monetary Policy Committee voted on April 7 to leave the
benchmark rate at a record low 0.5 percent, judging support for
the economic recovery should take precedence over tackling the
fastest inflation in more than two years.  “There will be some sterling bulls looking for additional
MPC members to join the hawk camp and they’ll be disappointed
when they don’t and they’ll sell sterling against the dollar and
the euro,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge fund sales
in London at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.  The pound declined 0.3 percent to 88.09 pence per euro as
of 8:33 a.m. in  London . Against the dollar, sterling gained 0.3
percent to $1.6371.  U.K. government bonds opened lower, pushing the yield on
the 10-year gilt up four basis points to 3.59 percent. Two-year
yields climbed three basis points to 1.18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
