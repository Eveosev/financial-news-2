The U.S. and the European Union are
finding it hard to agree on collection of air passenger data,
the  Financial Times Deutschland reported .  The U.S. wants to collect data on anyone suspected of
crimes carrying sentences of more than a year, and it wants to
save the information for 15 to 20 years, the newspaper said.  The EU wants data to be handed over only in individual
cases related to fighting terrorism or organized crime; it also
wants to restrict the length of time data can be saved and the
passing of information to third parties, the FTD said.  If no agreement can be reached, the U.S. would have to
pursue accords with individual EU states, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
