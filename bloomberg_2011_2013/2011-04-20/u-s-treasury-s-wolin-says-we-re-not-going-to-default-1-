Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin, said the nation won’t default on its obligations and that
Congress will vote to raise the debt limit.  “We’re not going to default,” Wolin said in an interview
today with CNBC. “Congress understands well that they are on
the hook for increasing the debt limit.”  JPMorgan Chase & Co. fixed income strategist Terry Belton
warned today of “large systemic effects with long-term adverse
consequences” if Congress doesn’t raise the debt limit in time.
Even a “technical” default caused by a short-term delay would
“severely” disrupt markets, he said.  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  has said the limit
will be reached no later than May 16, and that Treasury’s
emergency actions to continue borrowing will be exhausted by
around July 8. Geithner also has said that a U.S. default would
trigger a worse financial crisis than that of 2008 and 2009.  Wolin said today that he’s confident Congress will act to
avoid gaps in payments to retirees and members of the military.
He said he also sees an agreement emerging between Democrats and
Republicans on the terms of a plan to reduce budget deficits
over the long term.  Standard & Poor’s  put the U.S. government on notice this
week that it risks losing its AAA credit rating unless policy
makers agree on a plan by 2013 to reduce budget deficits and the
national debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
