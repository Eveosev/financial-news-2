The European Union cut greenhouse-
gas emissions by 7.2 percent in 2009 on lower demand for
electricity and heating in  Germany , the U.K. and Italy,
according to  preliminary data published  by the  United Nations .  The blocâ€™s 27 nations emitted 4.6 billion metric tons of
carbon dioxide equivalent, compared with 5 billion tons a year
earlier, according to the data released today by the UN
Framework Convention on  Climate Change  in Bonn. The so-called
national inventory report was provided by the European
Environment Agency in Copenhagen.  Emissions for the EU-15 fell below their Kyoto Protocol
target for the first time, the agency said. They dropped 12.9
percent compared with 1990, compared with a target of minus 8
percent in the five years through 2012.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
