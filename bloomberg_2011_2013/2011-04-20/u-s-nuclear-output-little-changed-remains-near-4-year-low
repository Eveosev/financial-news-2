U.S. nuclear-power output remained
near a 4½-year low for a third day, the  Nuclear Regulatory
Commission  said.  Power generation nationwide increased 57 megawatts to
72,319 megawatts, or 71 percent of capacity, according to an NRC
report today and data compiled by Bloomberg. Output sank
yesterday to the smallest since Oct. 22, 2006. Twenty-nine of
the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Constellation Nuclear Energy Group LLC, a joint venture of
 Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG)  and Electricite de France SA,
boosted output at its 621-megawatt Nine Mile Point Unit 1 to 34
percent of capacity from 1 percent yesterday.  The reactor is located about 6 miles northeast of Oswego,
New York, and was shut for refueling on March 21. Another unit
at the site, the 1,140-megawatt Unit 2, is operating at full
power.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
