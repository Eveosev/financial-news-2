German producer-price inflation
unexpectedly slowed in March.  Producer prices rose 6.2 percent from a year earlier after
increasing an annual 6.4 percent in February, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said in an e-mailed statement
today. Economists forecast an acceleration to 6.6 percent,
according to the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. In the month, prices rose 0.4 percent, half the 0.8
percent gain predicted by economists.  Energy prices showed the biggest annual gains, the
statistics office said, with light heating oil up 35.2 percent
and diesel 19.5 percent more expensive. Excluding energy costs,
producer-price inflation was at 4.4 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
