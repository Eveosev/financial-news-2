Australia will host  New Zealand  in
a soccer exhibition match in Adelaide on June 5, the teams’
second meeting in 13 months.  New Zealand, the only unbeaten nation at last year’s World
Cup in  South Africa , will take on the Socceroos three days after
facing Mexico in Denver, New Zealand Football said today.  World governing body FIFA will decide in July whether the
winner of New Zealand’s Oceania group will play off against
Asian, North American or South American opposition for a place
at the 2014 World Cup.  “We don’t know which part of the world our qualification
path will end in,” New Zealand coach Ricki Herbert said in a
statement. “So it’s important that as part of our preparations
we taste different environments until we know for sure where
that path leads.”  Prior to last year’s  World Cup  tuneup in Melbourne, won 2-1
by Australia, the trans-Tasman rivals hadn’t met since 2005.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
