The Australian dollar rose to a
record against its U.S. counterpart as stocks and commodities
rallied, boosting demand for assets linked to growth.  Australia ’s currency advanced for a second day against the
greenback after a government report showed prices increased for
the South Pacific nation’s exports, giving the central bank more
reason to raise  interest rates . The Australian and New Zealand
dollars strengthened versus the yen amid gains in raw materials,
which account for more than half of the nations’ exports.  “Economies globally seem to be recovering in a sustainable
way,” said  Marito Ueda , senior managing director in Tokyo at FX
Prime Corp., a foreign-exchange margin company. “Sentiment may
be risk on, so high-yielding currencies could be bought.”  The Aussie rose 1.3 percent to $1.0666 at 3:20 p.m. in  New
York , from $1.0526 yesterday. It earlier climbed to $1.0692, the
strongest since it was freely floated in 1983. The currency
gained 1.1 percent to 87.89 yen. New Zealand’s dollar advanced
0.7 percent to 79.40 U.S. cents and strengthened 0.4 percent to
65.43 yen.  Australia’s export price index climbed 5.2 percent in the
three months through March, the Bureau of Statistics said in
Sydney. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimated a 5 percent
increase. Import prices rose 1.4 percent.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of stocks climbed 1.9 percent and the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials increased
1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
