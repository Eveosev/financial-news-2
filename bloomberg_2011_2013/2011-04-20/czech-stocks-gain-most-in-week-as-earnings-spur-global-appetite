The Czech Republic’s main equity
index rose the most in a week, led by  New World Resources NV (NWR)  and
 CEZ AS (CEZ) , as company earnings in  Europe  and Asia beat estimates,
boosting investor demand for riskier assets.  The PX gauge of 15 companies gained 0.8 percent to 1,241.9
at its 4:28 p.m. close in Prague, a second day of advances. NWR,
the biggest Czech producer of coal for steelmakers, gained the
most in three months, rising 3.6 percent to 277 koruna.  Equities and commodities rallied worldwide as  Intel Corp .
forecast higher sales and better-than-expected earnings from
companies including PSA Peugeot Citroen and L’Oreal SA spurred
investor optimism in the global economic recovery.  “The Prague bourse was positively influenced today by the
good mood that ruled all global indexes,” Josef Bittner, an
analyst at Cyrrus, wrote in a report to clients today. The
brokerage is based in Brno, the second-largest Czech city.  CEZ rose the most since April 4, adding 1.4 percent to 890
koruna. The biggest Czech power producer extended gains after
Standard & Poor’s Equity Research raised its recommendation for
the stock to “hold” from “sell.”  Telefonica O2 Czech Republic AS (SPTT) , the largest phone operator
in the country, jumped 1.7 percent to 416.8 koruna, its highest
close in more than seven months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
