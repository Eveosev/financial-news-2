Steel output in  Japan , the world’s
second-largest producer, fell 2.7 percent in March from a year
earlier, the first drop in 17 months after the nation’s worst
earthquake damaged plants in devastated areas.  Crude steel output totaled 9.09 million metric tons, the
Japan Iron and Steel Federation said today in a  release . For the
financial year ended March, steel production increased by 15
percent to 110.8 million tons.  The magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami that struck
northeastern Japan on March 11 damaged plants operated by mills
such as Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. in affected areas.
Steelmakers are also delaying shipments to customers including
carmakers that slashed output due to parts shortage stemming
from the quake, Japan Iron and Steel Federation Chairman  Eiji
Hayashida  said yesterday.  Japanese steel output from blast furnaces fell 4.2 percent
from a year earlier to 7.08 million tons in March, while
production from electric-arc furnaces gained 3.3 percent to 2.01
million tons, the federation said today.  Sumitomo Metal, Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, said last
week it will take a charge of 60 billion yen ($724 million) for
the financial year ended March because of losses caused by the
earthquake.  New car sales in Japan decreased 37 percent in March from a
year earlier, the biggest drop for the month, according to the
Japan Automobile Dealers Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
