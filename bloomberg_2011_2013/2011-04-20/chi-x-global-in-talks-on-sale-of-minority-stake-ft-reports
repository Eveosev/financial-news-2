Chi-X Global, an alternative share-
trading platform operator, is in advanced talks with four banks
and trading firms to sell a minority stake, the Financial Times
reported, citing three unidentified people familiar with the
matter.  The four interested parties are Getco, a Chicago-based
proprietary trading firm, Quantlab Financial of Houston,
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the
newspaper said.  A transaction might value Chi-X, which is owned by  Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604)  through its Instinet agency broking service, at
$50 million, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
