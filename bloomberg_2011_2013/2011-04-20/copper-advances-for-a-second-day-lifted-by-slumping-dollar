Copper rose the most in four weeks
in New York as the dollar slumped, boosting demand for metals as
an alternative investment. Aluminum reached the highest since
August 2008 in  London .  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, fell as much as 1 percent to the lowest
level since December 2009. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of 19 raw materials gained the most in almost three weeks,
led by advances in silver, sugar and nickel. The six base metals
trading on the London Metal Exchange all climbed.  “It’s partly on dollar weakness and gradual recovery of
sentiment after the shock developments we had on Monday,” said
Stephen Briggs, a London-based analyst at BNP Paribas SA. Copper
reached a one-month low on April 18 after  Standard & Poor’s  put
a “negative” outlook on the AAA credit rating for the U.S.,
the second-largest user of the metal.  Copper futures for July delivery rose 11.05 cents, or 2.6
percent, to close at $4.359 a pound at 1:14 p.m. on the Comex in
New York, the biggest gain for the most-active contract since
March 23.  Before today, copper jumped 21 percent in the past year,
reaching an all-time high of $4.6575 on Feb. 15.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) , the world’s biggest
publicly traded copper producer, raised its 2011 sales forecast
as the industrial metal traded close to a record.  The outlook for copper is “extremely positive” as the
global economic recovery strengthens, Chief Executive Officer
Richard Adkerson said today on an earnings conference call.
“The world is going to need copper.”  On the LME, copper for three-month delivery climbed $240,
or 2.6 percent, to $9,580 a ton ($4.35 a pound).  Aluminum rose $16, or 0.6 percent, to $2,730 a metric ton,
after reaching $2,745, the highest since Aug. 29, 2008.  Lead, zinc, nickel and tin also rose in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
