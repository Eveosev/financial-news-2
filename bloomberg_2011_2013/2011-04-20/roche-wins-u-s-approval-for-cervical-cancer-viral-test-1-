Roche Holding AG (ROG) , the worldâ€™s
biggest diagnostics company, won U.S. approval for a test to
identify women at high risk of developing cervical cancer.  The test can be used to detect two types of the  human
papillomavirus , or HPV, that account for more than 70 percent of
cervical cancer cases, the Basel, Switzerland-based company said
today in a  statement . The Roche product also identifies 12 other
types that pose an increased risk of causing the disease.  U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the test was
based on a study of more than 47,000 American women. Cervical
cancer was responsible for more than 4,000 deaths in the U.S. in
2010 and more than 12,000 cases of the disease were diagnosed,
according to the  National Cancer Institute.  Screening usually is
carried out by means of a Pap smear in which cells are scraped
from the surface of the cervix and examined under a microscope.  The test is the only one that allows HPV 16 and 18
genotyping concurrently with high-risk HPV testing and has FDA
approval, Roche said in the statement.  Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV, a sexually
transmitted infection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
