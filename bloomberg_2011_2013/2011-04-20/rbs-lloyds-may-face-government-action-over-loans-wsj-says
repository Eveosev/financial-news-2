Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and
Lloyds Banking Group Plc should face government sanctions if
they fail to meet new lending targets, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing a report to be published today.  The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee will say in
its report that the Treasury appears to “lack strong
determination to use its influence to increase lending to small
businesses,” and an “effective mechanism” should be created
to ensure loan pledges are fulfilled, the newspaper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
