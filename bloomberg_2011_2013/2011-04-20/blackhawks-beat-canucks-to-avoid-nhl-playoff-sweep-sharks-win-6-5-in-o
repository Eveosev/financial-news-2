The  Chicago  Blackhawks beat the
Vancouver Canucks 7-2 to keep the defending Stanley Cup champion
alive in the National Hockey League playoff series.  Patrick Sharp had two goals less than 11 minutes apart in
the third period for Chicago last night, while Bryan Bickell,
Brian Campbell, Duncan Keith, Dave Bolland and Michael Frolik
also scored for the Blackhawks at United Center in Chicago.  The top-seeded Canucks lead the best-of-seven Western
Conference series 3-1 and can advance to the second round by
winning Game 5 tomorrow in Vancouver.  Sami Salo and Daniel Sedin scored the Canucks’ goals last
night.  At the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Devin Setoguchi’s
goal 3:09 into overtime lifted the  San Jose  Sharks to a 6-5 win
over the Los Angeles Kings and a 2-1 lead in their series.  Ryane Clowe scored two goals for the Sharks, who had
trailed 4-0 early in the second period. Patrick Marleau, Logan Couture and Joe Pavelski got the other goals for San Jose, which
travels to Los Angeles for Game 4 tomorrow.  Willie Mitchell, Kyle Clifford, Michal Handzus, Brad Richardson and Ryan Smyth tallied goals for the Kings.  The  Detroit Red Wings  can sweep their series with a win at
the  Phoenix Coyotes  tonight, when the top-seeded Washington
Capitals look to extend their lead to 3-1 at the  New York
Rangers . Elsewhere, the Pittsburgh Penguins take a 2-1 advantage
to the Tampa Bay Lightning, and the Nashville Predators host the
Anaheim Ducks leading 2-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
