Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY) ,  Malaysia â€™s
biggest lender by assets, issued S$1 billion ($806 million) of
3.8 percent bonds maturing in April 2021 in its biggest sale of
debt in the currency.  The subordinated notes, which count as Tier 2 capital, are
callable after five years, according to an e-mailed statement
from DBS Group Holdings Ltd., which helped manage the sale with
HSBC Holdings Plc, Kim Eng Securities, Oversea-Chinese Banking

of bonds and loans maturing before the end of 2021, the data
