European Union carbon permits rose
as  natural gas  and German power prices climbed.  EU emission allowances for December advanced 1 percent to
16.98 euros ($24.64) a metric ton as of 5 p.m. on  London ’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange. They’ve jumped 19 percent this year as
power utilities buy to hedge forward sales of electricity
through 2014 and beyond.  German power for 2012 gained 1.3 percent to 59.05 euros a
megawatt-hour, according to prices from brokers compiled by
Bloomberg. U.K. gas for the six months through September next
year, the summer contract, rose 1.4 percent on ICE. Coal for
next year also climbed 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
