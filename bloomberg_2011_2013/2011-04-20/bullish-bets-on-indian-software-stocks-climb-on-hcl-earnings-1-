Futures traders increased bullish
bets on Indian software exporters after  HCL Technologies Ltd. (HCLT) ,
the fourth-largest, reported better-than-expected earnings.  Open interest, or the number of contracts held by traders,
in  Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO) , India’s second-biggest software
maker, rose 4.9 percent to 44,620, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It rose 23 percent to 5,934 in HCL and 1.5 percent to
6,840 in  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)   “Traders are building long-positions on software shares
after HCL earnings on hopes its peers will post an improvement
in operating margins,” said Navneet Daga, derivatives analyst
at K.R. Choksey Shares and Securities Pvt. in Mumbai.  HCL surged 9.7 percent to 522.85 rupees, the most in 20
months, after third-quarter profit increased 33 percent to 4.68
billion rupees. That exceeded the 4.22 billion rupees average
estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Open interest in  call options  of  Tata Consultancy Services
Ltd. (TCS) , the biggest software maker, surged to 8,892, or more than
twice the 20-day average, before its earnings report tomorrow.
The stock added 4.6 percent to 1,218.7 rupees. Infosys had a
four-fold jump in open interest for its call options, Bloomberg
data show. The stock added 0.7 percent to 2,907.3 rupees, ending
a three-day, 13-percent decline.  “In Tata Consultancy, traders are buying options at the
1,250 strike price as they expect the stock to jump after
earnings,” Daga said. “In Infosys, traders are covering short
positions after the sharp decline.”  A call option gives the right to buy a security at a set
price by a specific date. A  put option  conveys the right to
sell. Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in the
price of securities they own, speculate on share-price moves or
bet that volatility will rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
