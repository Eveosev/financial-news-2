The chief judge of a Turkish court
faced peer pressure to reject a request to release military
officers from jail during their trial for an alleged plot to
overthrow the government, Vatan said.  The judge voted in favor of freeing the suspects, though
was out-voted by his two colleagues on the three-member legal
panel at the Istanbul court, the Istanbul-based newspaper
reported.  Some colleagues refused to talk to the judge and one judge
told him he expected him to make a “foolish” decision, Vatan
said.     Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
