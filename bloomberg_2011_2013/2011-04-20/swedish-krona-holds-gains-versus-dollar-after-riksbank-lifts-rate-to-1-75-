Sweden’s krona rallied to the
strongest in more than 2 1/2 years against the dollar after the
nation’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the
sixth time since July to curb inflation.  The Scandinavian currency appreciated versus all of its 16
major peers, advancing most against the dollar and the Japanese
yen. The  Riksbank  raised its key rate 25 basis points to 1.75
percent, as predicted by all 28 economists polled by Bloomberg,
and kept its rate forecast unchanged at an average 2.5 percent
in the first quarter of next year and 3.2 percent in the first
three months of 2013. Norway’s krone appreciated the most
against the dollar in more than a week.  “The Riksbank is still expected to hike rates at every
meeting this year, so the Swedish krona is still a good buy,”
said  John Hydeskov , chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S in London.
“There’s scope for the krona to accelerate further.”  The krona traded 1.5 percent stronger at 6.1298 per dollar
as of 4:29 p.m. in London, after reaching 6.1117, the strongest
since August 2008. Sweden’s currency gained 0.3 percent to
8.8902 per euro, a second day of gains.  Sweden’s currency has gained 4.5 percent this year against
a basket of its nine most-traded peers, the best performer
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The
gains come as rising economic growth fuels consumer spending and
inflation, forcing policy makers to raise borrowing costs.  Tighter Policy  Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said before today’s
decision that he can’t rule out tightening monetary policy at
every rate meeting this year.  The central bank raised its forecast for so-called headline
inflation to 3.2 percent this year from a 2.5 percent prediction
in February. The Swedish economy grew 5.5 percent last year and
will probably expand 4.6 percent in 2011, the bank estimates.  Norway’s krone appreciated as much as 1.4 percent to 5.3472
per dollar, the steepest intraday advance since April 8, before
trading at 5.3676. The Norwegian currency was 0.1 percent weaker
against the euro at 7.7854.  To contact the reporter on this story:
