OAO  Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s largest miner
of coal for steelmakers, said the Justice family sold $528
million of preferred shares in the company.  The family sold 32 million of the shares at $16.50 each,
Mechel said in a statement today. That’s a 17 percent discount
to the closing price of preferred American depository receipts
in  New York  yesterday, according to Bloomberg calculations.  The family sold Bluestone Coal Corp., a U.S. producer, to
Mechel in May 2009 for $436 million in cash and about 83 million
preferred shares. The Justices retain about 26 million of the
securities, after a sale last year, and are prohibited from a
further sale for 90 days, the offering prospectus shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
