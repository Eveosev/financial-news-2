U.S. stocks rallied, sending the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  to its highest level since June
2008, as sales at companies from  Intel Corp. (INTC)  to Yahoo! Inc.
exceeded estimates and commodity producers gained.  Intel climbed 7.8 percent, the most since March 2009, 
after the world's largest chipmaker also forecast revenue that
may top projections. Yahoo! Inc., the most-visited U.S. Web 
portal, jumped 4.7 percent.  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , the maker
of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Carrier air conditioners, rose
4.3 percent after lifting the lower end of its sales forecast. 
 Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  added at least 1.2 percent as 
commodity prices advanced amid a weaker  U.S. dollar .  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1.4 percent, the
most in a month, to 1,330.36 at 4 p.m. in  New York . The Dow
average surged 186.79 points, or 1.5 percent, to 12,453.54. The
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which measures
the cost of using options as insurance against losses in the  S&P
500 , slid 4.8 percent to 15.07, the lowest since 2007.  “We’ve had enough good earnings,” said Peter Tuz,
president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville,
 Virginia , which manages $1.5 billion. “For lots of companies
across different industries, this was a wait-and-see quarter,
where people wondered -- was the economy slowing down? A lot of
the companies have come through that with good numbers and a
pretty positive outlook. That’s a bullish indication.”  Earnings Scorecard  Earnings-per-share beat analysts’ estimates at 76 percent
of the 59 companies in the S&P 500 that reported results since
April 11, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Companies in the
index have topped estimates for eight straight quarters, the
longest streak since at least 2006, helping propel the gauge up
as much as 99 percent from the market bottom on March 9, 2009,
Bloomberg data show.  The benchmark gauge this month rose to near the highest
closing level for the rally, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The S&P 500 advanced to 1,335.54 on April 6, or 7.47
points below the high on Feb. 18.  Stocks extended gains today after sales of previously owned
U.S. homes increased 3.7 percent to a 5.1 million annual rate in
March, exceeding the 5 million median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, data from the National Association
of Realtors showed. The median price fell from a year earlier,
and 40 percent of sales were distressed properties.  Companies most-tied to economic growth, including
technology, energy and consumer discretionary shares, led the
gains in the S&P 500 within 10 groups. The Morgan Stanley
Cyclical Index rallied 1.8 percent as 29 of its 30 stocks
advanced.  Chipmakers Surge  A gauge of chipmakers in the S&P 500 surged 5.3 percent,
leading the gains among 24 industries.  Intel jumped 7.8 percent to $21.41 for the biggest gain in
the Dow as the company’s forecast added to evidence of booming 
demand for machines that deliver computing over the Internet. 
Second-quarter revenue will be $12.8 billion, plus or minus $500
million, Intel said. That compares with $11.9 billion, the average
of analysts’ projections.  First-quarter net income rose 29 percent to $3.16 billion,
or 56 cents a share, from $2.44 billion, or 43 cents, a year
earlier. Analysts on average had estimated profit of 46 cents.
Sales increased 25 percent to $12.8 billion, compared with an
average prediction of $11.6 billion.  Yahoo climbed 4.7 percent to $16.87. The most-visited U.S.
Web portal reported first-quarter sales that topped estimates as
companies stepped up their use of  Internet advertising .
Excluding sales passed on to partner sites, revenue was $1.06
billion. Analysts had estimated $1.05 billion on average.  All Five Divisions  United Technologies increased 4.3 percent to $85.90 after
raising the lower end of its sales forecast for the year as the
Carrier air-conditioning unit led revenue gains in all five
divisions. Sales in 2011 may be $57 billion, up from a previous
forecast of at least $56 billion. Chief Executive Officer  Louis Chenevert  raised the full-year profit forecast by a nickel to as
much as $5.40.  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  added 6.5 percent to $147.92. The owner
of the Wynn and Encore casinos reported first-quarter profit
rose sixfold, beating analysts’ estimates, lifted by a second
Macau resort and improved results in Las Vegas.  “The risk-on trade is in full-blown mode,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Philadelphia-based
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages $53 billion. “The
surprise factor was sort of being lost in the market. The good
corporate earnings across the board reinforce the idea that the
global recovery is in place. As a consequence, equities and
commodities are feeling the benefits of that.”  Commodity Rally  Commodity producers rallied as a weaker dollar and concern
about debt and faster inflation spurred demand for an
alternative investment. The Dollar Index, a gauge of the
currency against six major peers, slid 0.9 percent to 74.33, its
lowest level since 2009. A U.S. bond market gauge of trader
inflation expectations approached the highest level since 2008.
Gold futures rose to a record above $1,500 an ounce.  Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, rallied 1.2
percent to $16.64. Chevron, the second-biggest U.S. energy
company, increased 2.3 percent to $107.81.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  gained 3.1 percent to
$53.30. The largest publicly traded copper producer said it will
pay a one-time 50-cent-a-share dividend and raised its 2011
sales forecast as the industrial metal traded close to a record.  Special Dividend  Freeport, which operates mines in the U.S.,  Africa  and
 Indonesia , forecast full-year copper sales of 3.9 billion pounds
and gold sales of 1.6 million ounces, up from predictions in
January. The supplemental dividend of 50 cents, which was
declared in addition to Freeport’s regular 25-cent quarterly
payout, will be paid June 1, the company said.  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  fell 0.4 percent to
$164.75. The world’s largest computer-services provider said
first-quarter services signings fell 14 percent from a year
earlier. Still, IBM said operating earnings will be at least
$13.15 a share this year, higher than a previous projection of
at least $13 and the $13.08 average estimate of analysts.  Banks had the only decline in the S&P 500 within 24
industries, slumping 2.3 percent as a group.  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  tumbled 4.1 percent to $28.83. The
largest U.S. home lender said first-quarter revenue fell 5.2
percent to $20.3 billion as fees from mortgage banking declined
and average loans outstanding decreased.  Banks Trail S&P 500  Bank stocks are underperforming the S&P 500, even after
Federal Reserve stress tests showed some financial institutions
have regained enough strength to boost dividends and buy back
their shares. A lack of loan growth and increased costs from new
regulations plague the industry, according to  Paul Miller , a
former examiner for the Fed Bank of Philadelphia and a bank
analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia.  “I don’t think we’ll get enough economic growth to spur
strong loan demand, which is the primary revenue-driver,” he
said. “Some investors are concerned the economy will just slug
around for the next three or four more years.”  Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)  slumped 1.3 percent to $96.07. The
biggest U.S. railroad by sales posted profit that trailed
analysts’ estimates after fuel prices climbed and winter
snowstorms curbed first-quarter growth. Net income advanced to
$639 million, or $1.29 a share, from $516 million, or $1.01, a
year earlier. Earnings were projected to be $1.31, the average
of 28 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
