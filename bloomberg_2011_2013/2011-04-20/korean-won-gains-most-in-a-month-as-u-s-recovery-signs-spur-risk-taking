South Korea ’s won strengthened the
most in more than two months after U.S. housing starts rose and
earnings beat estimates at companies including Johnson & Johnson,
bolstering confidence in the global economic recovery.  The currency climbed to its strongest level since September
2008, supported by an improved outlook for exports and
speculation overseas investors will pump more funds into
emerging-market assets. The Kospi stock index closed at a record
high, having dropped yesterday for a third day after  Standard &
Poor’s  cut the outlook on its AAA credit rating for the U.S.  The impact of the “U.S. long-term credit outlook cut to
negative proved short-lived,” said Seo Jeong Hun, a currency
analyst at Korea Exchange Bank in  Seoul . “In the longer term,
there are more factors for the won to appreciate, and more
dollar inflows are expected from the nation’s exporters and
foreign stock investors.”  The won climbed 0.8 percent to 1,082.35 at the 3 p.m. close
in Seoul, the biggest jump since Feb. 2, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,082.05, the strongest level
since Sept. 8, 2008.  Overseas funds bought more stocks listed on the Kospi than
they sold today, for the first time in seven days, exchange data
showed.  Government bonds  fell, with the yield on South Korea’s 3
percent bond due December 2013 increasing two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 3.73 percent, according to prices from
Korea Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
