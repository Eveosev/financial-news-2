Sugar may fall on signs that
production will exceed estimates and reach a record in  Thailand ,
the world’s biggest exporter after  Brazil .  Ten of 11 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said that raw sugar traded in New York will fall.
One said it will rise. Before today, futures for July delivery
dropped 5.4 percent this week to 22.51 cents a pound.  Nine of 11 respondents said refined sugar on  London ’s NYSE
Liffe exchange will decline, one said it will gain, and one
expected little change. Through yesterday, the price lost 3.8
percent this week to $615.10 a metric ton.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener may narrow next
week, according to six of 11 respondents. Three forecast little
change, and two said the spread will widen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
