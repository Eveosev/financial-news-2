The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options slumped to its lowest intraday level since July 2007 as
shares rallied on better-than-estimated quarterly reports from
companies including  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and Yahoo! Inc.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, decreased 4.8 percent to 15.07 at 4:15 p.m. in
 New York , after falling as low as 14.30. The index measures the
cost of using options as insurance against declines in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which added 1.4 percent.  “There’s a lack of buying interest because people either
are already protected or they feel like they just don’t need it
right now,”said Philippe Trouve, the VIX options trader and
director for equity derivatives at Bank of America Corp. in New
York. “Also we have a three-day weekend and  Europe  has four
days, so people don’t want to own short-dated options.”  U.S. stocks advanced, sending the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  to the highest level since June 2008, after Intel, the
biggest chipmaker, forecast revenue that may top projections and
Yahoo, the most-visited U.S. Web portal, reported first-quarter
sales that beat estimates. Of the 58 S&P 500 components that
have reported earnings since April 11, 78 percent have beaten
analysts’ per-share earnings estimates.  May VIX futures fell 5 percent to 18.15, while July
contracts slumped 1.6 percent to 21.55. The biggest advance
among all VIX options was on the May 14 puts, which rose to 5
cents from 2 cents. This year’s lowest VIX close before today
was 15.32 on April 15. The gauge has averaged 20.37 in its two-
decade history.  In Europe, the benchmark gauge of stock-market volatility
fell. The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protecting
against a decline in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, slumped 8.3
percent to 19.08. It fell to 17.32 earlier, the lowest level
since December 2007. The Euro Stoxx 50 index gained 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
