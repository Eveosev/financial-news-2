BP Plc (BP/)  is alone among peers in
failing to follow oil prices higher a year after the blowout in
the Gulf of Mexico started the worst U.S. spill.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how BP shares have become
unhinged from West Texas Intermediate crude futures in New York
trading. Rivals  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  have
tracked the 31 percent gain in oil prices since the accident on
April 20, 2010.  BP Chief Executive Officer  Robert Dudley  has set aside $41
billion to cover cleanup and legal costs from the spill, sold
off more than $24 billion in assets and focused the company on
exploration. The shares are down 7 percent since Jan. 14, when
Dudley agreed to an alliance with OAO Rosneft that was later
blocked in court by partners in the TNK-BP venture. Crude prices
have gained 20 percent since then.  “BP has two crosses to bear in the  Gulf of Mexico  in
Russia,” said Doug Youngson, an analyst at Arbuthnot Securities
Ltd. in London who has a “sell” rating on BP. “We don’t have
any visibility on the legal outcomes and I struggle to see where
they’re going. They’re not in a good place.”  BP releases first-quarter earnings on April 27. Exxon and
Shell give their results the following day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
