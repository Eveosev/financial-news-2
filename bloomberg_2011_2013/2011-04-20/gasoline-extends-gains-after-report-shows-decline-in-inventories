Gasoline futures extended their
gains after the U.S. Energy Department reported a decline in
inventories and an unexpected drop in crude oil inventories.  Stockpiles of gasoline dropped 1.58 million barrels to
208.1 million, the report showed. The median forecast of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a decline of 1.75
million barrels.  Crude oil stockpiles fell 2.32 million barrels to 357
million. Analysts had expected a gain of 1.3 million barrels.  Gasoline demand slipped 1.3 percent to 9.06 million barrels
a day. The four-week average was little changed at 8.99 million.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 1.94 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $3.2525 a gallon at 10:33 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price, which settled yesterday at $3.2331, was
$3.2464 before the report was released at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
