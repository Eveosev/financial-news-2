Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , a unit of the
casino operator founded by billionaire Steven Wynn, rose in  Hong
Kong  trading as Chinese high-stakes gamblers boosted first-
quarter profit by 66 percent.  The owner of Macau’s Wynn and Encore casinos gained 1.1
percent to HK$27.35 at the close in Hong Kong trading after
climbing as much as 4.8 percent to HK$28.35, the highest
intraday level since it started trading in October 2009. The
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose 1.6 percent.  The opening of a second resort in the world’s biggest
gambling hub and better-than-expected winnings in  Las Vegas  led
parent  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  to post a sixfold growth in first-
quarter profit, beating analysts’ estimates. The company expects
government permission to start building a third Macau resort
“any day now,” Wynn said yesterday.  “ Wynn Macau  is the best proxy of Macau,” Karen Tang, a
Hong Kong-based analyst for Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a note to
clients today. Its casinos offer “superior customer
experiences, which lengthen play,” she said.  Wynn Macau opened Encore Macau in April 2010 in the former
Portuguese colony, the world’s biggest gambling hub and the only
place in  China  where casinos are legal.  First-quarter net income at Wynn Resorts expanded to $173.8
million from $27 million a year earlier, the Las Vegas-based
company said yesterday.  Slots Revenue  Wynn Macau’s profit grew to $189.7 million from $114.3
million, it said today. VIP sales rose 45 percent to $29.3
billion, and slot-machine revenue increased 59 percent to $1.5
billion, the company said.  “This quarter, the most impressive segment was slots,”
Tang said. “Wynn Macau has carved out a nice niche in the high-
end slot segment in Macau.”  Gambling in the Chinese city has surged since the
government ended billionaire  Stanley Ho ’s 40-year monopoly and
allowed companies including Wynn,  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  and  MGM
Resorts International (MGM)  to build resorts.  Casino gambling revenue  in Macau climbed 43 percent to 58.5
billion patacas ($7.3 billion) in the three months ended March
as gamblers from mainland China placed more bets. Total casino
revenue expanded 58 percent last year to 188.3 billion patacas
or $23.5 billion, about four times that of the $5.8 billion for
the Las Vegas Strip.  Chinese High Rollers  Revenue from VIP or high-stakes gamblers, who wager as much
as 2 million patacas a hand, was 42.6 billion patacas,
accounting for 73 percent of Macau’s total first-quarter casino
gambling revenue, government data show. That’s up from 70
percent in the same period in 2010.  Most of the VIP gamblers are brought into the city by
junket operators from mainland China, which doesn’t include Hong
Kong, Macau and Taiwan.  Wynn is founder and chief executive officer of Wynn
Resorts, which owns about 72 percent of the Hong Kong-listed
Macau unit.  Separately,  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  posted a 71
percent increase in earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to HK$712 million ($92 million)
today, and predicted record first-half earnings on revenue from
high-stakes gamblers.  Galaxy,  part-owned  by Permira Advisers LLP, surged 6
percent to HK$13.82 in Hong Kong trading, the highest level
since it began trading in October 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
