American Airlines parent  AMR Corp. (AMR) 
posted a smaller first-quarter loss than analysts estimated and
trimmed planned growth as rising prices pushed fuel to its
biggest expense.  Excluding certain costs related to aircraft, the loss was
$405 million, or $1.21 a share, compared with $452 million, or
$1.36, a year earlier, the  Fort Worth , Texas-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts anticipated $1.32, the average of
13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  American paid 24 percent more for each gallon of fuel,
compared with a year earlier, and the expense accounted for 32
percent of operating costs. The airline reduced 2011 capacity
growth for a second time in less than two months, to 2.2 percent
from 3.6 percent, to reduce fuel consumption.  “ Oil prices  have increased substantially and that has made
a number of marginal routes and flights less profitable for the
airlines,” said Matthew Jacob, an analyst with ITG Investment
Research in  New York . “As oil prices stay high, and there’s
expectations they could go higher, we are likely to see more
airlines cut capacity and airlines that already have cut to look
to cut even more.”  AMR fell 6 cents to $5.64 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 28 percent
this year.  Airlines’ Losses  American is the first of the five largest U.S. carriers to
report first-quarter results. Among them, only  Southwest
Airlines Co. (LUV)  is projected by analysts to post a profit. United
Continental Holdings Inc. and Southwest are scheduled to report
results tomorrow, with  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and  US Airways Group
Inc. (LCC)  set for April 26.  American and other major U.S. airlines implemented six
broad fare increases during the quarter to help offset a 41
percent surge in the average benchmark price of  jet fuel .
American’s international passenger traffic, which generally
carries the highest fares, rose 5.8 percent.  “High fuel prices remain one of the biggest challenges to
our industry and our company,” Chief Executive Officer Gerard Arpey said in the statement. AMR expects its fuel bill this year
to increase as much as $2.1 billion over the $6.4 billion it
spent in 2010, he said on a conference call. AMR spent $1.84
billion on fuel in the first quarter.  The company’s net loss narrowed to $436 million, or $1.31 a
share, from $505 million, or $1.52, a year earlier. This year’s
loss includes $31 million in one-time, non-cash costs linked to
aircraft that AMR sold and then leased back.  Storms, Fire, Earthquake  Sales rose 9.2 percent to $5.53 billion from a year
earlier. Winter storms that forced cancellation of 9,000
American flights, a fuel farm fire at the Miami airport, the
Japan earthquake and tsunami, and a dispute with online travel
agencies reduced revenue by more than $100 million, Chief
Financial Officer Bella Goren said today.  American suspended two of six daily U.S.-Japan flights on
April 6 because of a drop in demand following the earthquake,
and said then the service would resume April 26. The carrier is
monitoring demand, Goren said, and hasn’t “made further
decisions.” She agreed with some estimates that demand has
declined as much as 30 percent.  The airline will retire at least 25 MD-80 aircraft from its
fleet this year as it works to replace the aging planes with
more fuel-efficient  Boeing Co. (BA)  737-800s. American has 219 MD-
80s, with an average age of 19 years. The planes account for 35
percent of American’s total fleet.  The airline is “hoping” it can manage the capacity
reduction without employee layoffs, counting instead on expected
retirements and attrition, Arpey said.  American also said today it exercised options for two more
Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to be delivered in 2012 and 2013. The
action brings to five the number of 777-300ERs that will be
delivered to the carrier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
