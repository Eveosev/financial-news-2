Zaklady Azotowe Pulawy SA (ZAP) , Poland’s
largest fertilizer maker, may use natural gas instead of coal in
a planned 1,400-megawatt power plant, said Wojciech Kozak, the
company board member responsible for the project.  The company is in talks with a new partner for the facility
after Vattenfall AB, its initial partner, decided in September
to sell Polish assets, Kozak said today by telephone from
Pulawy, central Poland.  “We are in talks with a new partner, who is very
interested in building a gas-fired power plant,” Kozak said
today in a phone interview. “Initially our primary
consideration was to use coal as fuel, now we’re focused on gas,
although other options are not excluded.”  Uncertainty about  Poland  being able to keep getting carbon
emission rights for free after 2012 is a factor as the fuel
emits about half as much CO2 per megawatt generated as coal,
Kozak said. Negotiations with the new partner may be completed
next month or in June and the plant’s capacity may be reduced to
800 megawatts if gas is chosen, according to Kozak.  In 2008, the European Union said Poland and other eastern
European countries would be able to phase-in the cost of
emission rights after 2012 in their carbon-intensive power
sectors. Meanwhile, eligibility criteria are still to be settled
and applying countries may have to wait until next year to find
out if their utilities will get some permits free, extending the
uncertainty for investments in carbon-intensive power
generation.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE) , Poland’s second-largest company,
said April 14 it switched to natural gas from coal as fuel for a
plant with capacity of 810 to 900 megawatts it wants to build
with copper producer  KGHM Polska Miedz SA. (KGH)   To contact the reporter on this story:
