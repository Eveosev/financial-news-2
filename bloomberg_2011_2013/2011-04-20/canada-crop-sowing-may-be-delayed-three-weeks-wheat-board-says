Grain planting in  Canada  may be one
week to three weeks delayed as cold, wet weather slows snow melt
and prolongs floods, the Canadian Wheat Board said in a
 statement  on its website.  Canadian Prairies had as much as 3 centimeters (1.2 inches)
of precipitation last week, and temperatures in western and
central growing areas were as much as 5 degrees Celsius below
normal, the board said. Slowly melting snow is delaying river
crests, and floods in the Frenchman River Basin may be the
largest since 1952, the board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
