Saipem SpA (SPM) , Europe’s largest
oilfield services contractor, rose the most in more than a month
after it said new orders mean the company will beat 2011 profit
and sales targets.  Both net profit and revenue will increase 8 percent this
year instead of the forecast 5 percent boosted by contracts won
in the offshore segment and “operational activities on some
onshore projects which have been brought forward,” the Milan-
based company said today in a stock-exchange statement.  Shares rose as much as 2.6 percent today in Milan trading,
the most since March 18, and traded at 37.5 euros as of 2:35
p.m. local time. That gives the company a market value of 16.5
billion euros ($23.9 billion).  Saipem is seeking to boost its offshore business by
expanding its drilling fleet. The company said today it will
increase 2011 investments 10 percent to 1.1 billion euros.  Saipem  posted a 17 percent rise in first-quarter net
profit to 213 million euros ($309 million) on increased revenue
in northern  Europe ,  Kazakhstan  and the Middle East.  Sales rose 12 percent to 2.95 billion euros. The company
was awarded new contracts for 2.9 billion euros in the quarter,
compared with 2.7 billion euros in the first quarter of last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
