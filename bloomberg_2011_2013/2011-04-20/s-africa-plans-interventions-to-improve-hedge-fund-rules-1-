South Africa  is looking at
“interventions” to improve regulation of  hedge funds , Deputy
Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene said.  These interventions will add to existing rules governing
hedge fund managers in South Africa, Nene said at a conference
of securities regulators in Cape Town today, without giving
details of the planned rules.  South Africa’s Financial Services Board expects draft
legislation for hedge funds to be adopted by the first half of
2010, the regulator said in November. Hedge funds are not
governed by the same rules as mutual funds, although hedge fund
managers are subject to the regulator’s supervision.  “We are looking at interventions to regulate hedge funds
in South Africa, bearing in mind that hedge fund managers are
already regulated,” Nene said at the annual conference of the
 International Organization of Securities Commissions .  The U.S. and European Union have stepped up regulation of
the hedge fund industry blamed by lawmakers for exacerbating the
financial crisis. Hedge funds are mostly private pools of
capital whose managers participate substantially in the profits
from their speculation on whether the price of assets will rise
or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
