Poland ’s WIG20 Index climbed for a
second day, increasing 46.60, or 1.6 percent, to 2,934.69 at
2:44 p.m. in Warsaw, heading for the highest close in almost
three years.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Cinema City International NV (CCI)   dropped 0.39 zloty,
or 1 percent, to 37.9 zloty as central Europe’s largest movie-
theater operator was cut to “hold” from “buy” at UniCredit
SpA.  Grupa Kety SA (KTY)   gained for the first time in five
days, adding 2.8 zloty, or 2.2 percent, to 133.3 zloty. Poland’s
largest aluminum products maker said first-quarter net income
rose 25 percent to 18.8 million zloty ($6.8 million) as sales
increased to 322.6 million zloty. That compares with a March 30
forecast of 15 million zloty to 17 million zloty on sales of 300
million zloty to 310 million zloty.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, jumped 7.7 zloty, or 4.1 percent,
to 197.7 zloty, heading for the highest close since the stock
started trade in 1997. Copper rose as the dollar slumped, making
metals priced in the currency cheaper in terms of other monies
and spurring demand for raw materials as an alternative
investment.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, rose
1.45 zloty, or 2.6 percent, to 57.85 zloty.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-largest refiner, added 0.89 zloty, or 1.9
percent, to 48.99 zloty. Oil rallied as signs of an improving
economy in the U.S., the world’s biggest consumer of crude,
stoked speculation demand for fuel may increase.  Trakcja Polska SA (TRK)   declined 0.05 zloty, or 1.4
percent, to 3.58 zloty, heading for the lowest close in almost
two weeks. The Polish railway builder completed a purchase of
Tiltra Group, Lithuania’s largest construction company, after
saying April 1 that the deal had expired. The 777.5 million-
zloty price in the agreement may be adjusted based on Tiltra’s
earnings under an agreement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
