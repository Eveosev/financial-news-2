Kenya ’s average asking price for a
house or apartment increased by 4.4 percent in the first quarter
amid an expansion in mortgage lending and higher economic
growth, according to the Hass Property Index.  Kenyan home-sellers asked for 21.94 million shillings
($261,190) compared with 21.01 million shillings three months
earlier,  HassConsult Ltd. , a real-estate agency based in the
capital, Nairobi, said in a statement handed to reporters today.
The average asking price for a home in the East African nation
rose 15 percent from a year earlier, it said.  Housing developers are opting to build multi-unit
residences to create more rental income, Farhana Hassanali,
HassConsult’s property development director, told reporters in
Nairobi today. The units sit empty for long periods because
buyers are looking for stand-alone homes, Hassanali said.  “The land prices themselves are moving beyond viability
and have created the possibility of a bubble,” she said. The
situation may “see some investors and speculators take losses
once land cannot be profitably developed for residential use.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
