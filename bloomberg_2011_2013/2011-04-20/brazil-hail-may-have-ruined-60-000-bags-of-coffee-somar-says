Hail in Brazil’s  Minas Gerais  state
last week may have ruined 60,000 bags of coffee, or less than 1
percent of this year’s harvest, according to Marco Antonio dos
Santos, an agronomist at the Sao Paulo-based Somar Meteorologia.  About 2,400 hectares (5,930 acres) of coffee plantations
were affected in Nova Rezende in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil’s
largest coffee-producing region, Santos said in a report
yesterday.  “That would amount to losses of between 50,000 and 60,000
bags in Nova Rezende,” Santos said by phone from  Sao Paulo 
today. Some trees won’t produce beans until two years, he said.  Brazil, the world’s largest producer of coffee, is forecast
to produce between 41.9 million bags and 44.7 million bags of
coffee this year, the Agriculture Ministry said in January. It
mostly produces arabica coffee beans, favored by coffee shops.  A cold air mass from the  South Pole  may reach southeast
Brazil in the week starting May 9, Santos said. That region
includes Minas Gerais and  Espirito Santo , the country’s biggest
producer of robusta coffee beans. A frost is not forecast, he
said. Robusta beans are used in instant coffee.  Arabica coffee for July delivery advanced as much as 8.25
cents, or 2.8 percent, to $3.025 a pound on ICE Futures U.S, the
highest price for a most-active contract since May 1997. Robusta
coffee for July delivery rose $37, or 1.5 percent, to $2,489 a
metric ton by 4:24 p.m. in  London  on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
