Brazil â€™s Trade Minister Fernando Pimentel said the government will soon adopt measures to contain
the appreciation of the local currency.  Pimentel, speaking today on Brazil Public Radio, said the
strong real is damaging domestic manufacturers.  The real gained 0.83 percent to 1.5633 per U.S. dollar at
8:06 a.m. New York time. Since the end of 2008, the real has
jumped 47 percent, the second best performer after the
Australian dollar amid the 16 most traded currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Since October, the government has increased taxes on
foreign capital inflows, stepped up dollar purchases in the spot
and futures market and imposed  reserve requirements  for banks
betting against the dollar to contain the rally of the real.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega , speaking to reporters April
18, also said the government would keep taking measures to
contain the currency gains.  To contact the reporters on this story:
