Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego is
“more likely” to sell euro-denominated bonds to finance  road
construction  in the third quarter than in the second, Wojciech
Kowalczyk, managing director in charge of the treasury
department at the state-owned Polish lender, said in a telephone
interview today.  Interest from foreign investors in the state-guaranteed
debt is “very strong” and the bank known as BGK could “easily
raise significant amounts,” Kowalczyk said. By selling road
bonds in euros BGK would sell fewer zloty-denominated bonds, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
