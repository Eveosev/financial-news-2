Ukraine expects to have a bigger
grain harvest this year as a result of a large winter crop,
Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said today in the capital Kiev.  The grain condition was better this winter than last year,
according to the Agriculture Ministry. Winter grains in good and
satisfactory condition accounted for 93.4 percent of the crop as
of April 8, compared with 85 percent a year earlier, according
to ministry data.  “This allows us to expect a significantly bigger harvest
than last year” if the weather is favorable, Azarov said today,
at a government meeting.  Winter grains, which typically make up the bigger of the
two annual crops, have been fertilized on 7.5 million hectares,
or on more than 90 percent of all plantings, he said.  Ukraine harvested 39.2 million tons of grains in 2010,
according to statistics office data.  Rain in the Ukraine last week helped winter grains and
slowed the spring planting.  About 3.08 million hectares (7.6 million acres) of spring
grains had been planted as of yesterday, compared with 3.84
hectares in the year earlier period, according to the
Agriculture Ministry data. That’s a drop of 20 percent.  Spring grain planting covers 76 percent of the planned
area, Halyna Karpa, the spokeswoman of the Agriculture Ministry,
said by phone today.  Some regions have started planting sunflowers and corn,
Azarov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
