BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , a U.K. oil explorer
focused on Cameroon, said it found more oil and gas in the
Sapele well off the African country’s coast.  The company drilled the Sapele-1 sidetrack, which
encountered a total of 23 meters (75 feet) of hydrocarbon-
bearing interval in the Omicron reservoir, the Edinburgh-based
company said today in a statement. It will need more tests to
estimate the deposit’s resource potential.  “Due to the stratigraphic nature of the Omicron
discoveries further appraisal will be required,” BowLeven said.
“The Sapele-2 well, intended to appraise both the Lower and
Deep Omicron discoveries.”  BowLeven is drilling Block 5 in Cameroon, which may hold as
much as 1 billion barrels oil equivalent, BowLeven Chief
Executive Officer Kevin Hart forecast last month. The Sapele-1
side track and Sapele-2 wells may hold in excess of 100 million
barrels of recoverable oil, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
