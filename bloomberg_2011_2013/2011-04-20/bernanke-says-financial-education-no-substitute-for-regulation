Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said financial literacy education and research must be
combined with strong regulation to protect consumers from
“abusive and fraudulent practices.”  Bernanke didn’t comment on the outlook for the  U.S. economy 
or monetary policy in a prepared statement released today and
provided for the record of a subcommittee hearing by the Senate
 Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs Committee. The panel
held a hearing on financial literacy April 12.  The central bank is working closely with the U.S. Treasury
Department to transfer some powers to the new Bureau of Consumer
Financial Protection, Bernanke said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
