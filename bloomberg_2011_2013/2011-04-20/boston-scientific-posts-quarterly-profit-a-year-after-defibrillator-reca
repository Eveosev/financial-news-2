Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) , the
second-largest maker of heart devices, raised its 2011 earnings
forecast and reported a quarterly profit a year after
withdrawing implantable defibrillators from the market.  First-quarter net income was $20 million, or 1 cent a
share, compared with a net loss of $1.59 billion, or $1.05, a
year earlier, the Natick, Massachusetts-based company said today
in a statement. Earnings excluding certain items were 22 cents a
share, beating the 4-cent average estimate of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue was more than analysts expected.  Boston Scientific rose in extended trading after the
company increased its forecast for full-year profit excluding
one-time items by 8 cents to a range of 58 to 68 cents a share.
The shares had declined this year, weighed down by Chief
Executive Officer Ray Elliott’s prediction in February that it
would be a “difficult” year for the device maker as economic
pressures curb sales of defibrillators and heart stents.  “At first glance -- despite challenging markets -- it
seems like the major franchises were roughly in line with
expectations and even somewhat above for the stent business,”
said  Rick Wise , an analyst at Leerink Swann & Co. in  New York ,
in an e-mail. The results “should be positive for the stock.”  Shares Rise  Boston Scientific rose 27 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $7.35
at 5:18 p.m. in extended trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares have fallen 6.5 percent this year, making the stock
the worst performer among 13 companies in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Health-Care Equipment Index.  Revenue fell 1.8 percent to $1.93 billion, $30 million
ahead of the average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Global defibrillator sales rose 6.9 percent to $417
million, and drug-coated stent sales fell 6.9 percent to $379
million. Wise projected a 12 percent decline in the stent sales
because of negative pricing pressure.  First-quarter earnings included $723 million in costs to
write down the value of the cardiac rhythm management business
and a $530 million gain from the sale of a neurovascular
business to  Stryker Corp. (SYK) , Boston Scientific said. The year-
earlier results were lowered by $1.8 billion in costs tied to
the March 15, 2010, defibrillator recall after the company
failed to notify regulators of manufacturing changes.  Boston Scientific said full-year sales will be $7.6
billion to $7.9 billion, up from a low of $7.5 billion forecast
on Feb. 2.  Medtronic Inc. (MDT) , of  Minneapolis , is the largest maker of
heart devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
