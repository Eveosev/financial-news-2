North American investors last month
bought the most Japanese stocks in more than five years, lured
by a buying opportunity following an earthquake and tsunami that
devastated the countryâ€™s northeast coast, triggered a nuclear
accident and sent stocks tumbling.  North American investors bought 928.6 billion yen ($11.2
billion) of Japanese shares in March, the most since Sept. 2005,
according to  data  from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY) 
Stock Average tumbled 16 percent in the two days after a 9-
magnitude earthquake and tsunami struck on March 11, leaving
almost 28,000 people dead or missing, and causing explosions and
radiation leaks at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi power station.  Investors in  North America  have been net buyers of Japanese
equities for nine months. Asian investors were also net
purchasers for a seventh month in March buying shares worth
549.7 billion yen, the most since Feb. 2007, the data shows.
Traders in  Europe  sold, unloading 125.8 billion yen in shares.  The Nikkei has rebounded 12 percent since hitting a post-
quake low on March 15. The broader Topix has risen 9.3 percent
in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
