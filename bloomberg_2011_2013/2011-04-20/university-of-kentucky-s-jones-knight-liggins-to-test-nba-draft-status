University of  Kentucky  freshmen
Terrence Jones and Brandon Knight, and junior DeAndre Liggins
declared for the National Basketball Association draft without
signing with an agent.  The trio helped lead the Wildcats to the Final Four of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament this season.
By not signing with an agent, they retain their college
eligibility as they weigh the option to play professional
basketball. They have until May 8 to withdraw from the draft and
return to Kentucky.  “I support the decision these three have made to take
advantage of the process,” Kentucky coach John Calipari said in
a statement from the school.  Jones, a 6-foot-8 forward, and Knight, a 6-foot-3 guard,
are projected as first-round picks by  NBAdraftnet.com  and  ESPN ,
while Liggins, a 6-foot-6 guard, may not be selected. Jones
averaged 15.7 points and 8.8 rebounds last season, and Knight
led the team with averages of 17.3 points and 4.2 assists.
Liggins averaged 8.6 points and four rebounds a game for the
Wildcats.  The NBA Draft will be held June 23 in  Newark ,  New Jersey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
