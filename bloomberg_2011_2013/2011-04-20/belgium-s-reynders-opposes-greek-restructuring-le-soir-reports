Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  doesn’t support a restructuring of  Greece ’s public
debt, Le Soir reported, citing an interview.  “No,” the newspaper cited the minister as saying when
asked whether a restructuring was the solution to Greece’s
fiscal problems. “The good step is exactly the opposite: we
must help the country to find a sustainable level of debt,”
Reynders said. “What concerns me is that many speculators are
pushing in a certain direction and are helped by certain
declarations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
