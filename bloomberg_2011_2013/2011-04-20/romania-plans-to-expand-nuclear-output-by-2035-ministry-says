Romania plans to expand its nuclear
power generation in the next 24 years by building two reactors
at its only atomic plant and building a new facility, the
country’s  Economy Ministry  said.  The Balkan nation plans to add as much as 4,600 megawatts
of nuclear capacity by 2035 to its existing output of 1,400
megawatts, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.
The country aims to install the two reactors at its Cernavoda
plant, operated by atomic-power company Nuclearelectrica SA, by
2020 and complete the new facility by 2030.  Radiation leaks from the Fukushima nuclear plant in  Japan 
following a devastating earthquake and tsunami on March 11 has
prompted governments such as  Germany  to rethink their nuclear
expansion plans. The Bucharest-based government is currently
seeking investors for the two nuclear reactors estimated at 4
billion euros ($5.8 billion), after CEZ AS,  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, RWE AG
and Iberdrola SA pulled out in January, citing unclear
regulations and doubts about future power demand.  “The most efficient solution to produce electricity, for
the period between 2020 and 2035, is a new nuclear power
plant,” the ministry said. “We will install the third and
fourth reactors at the Cernavoda plant by 2020, and after that,
depending on the evolution of consumption, we will start working
on the second nuclear power plant.”  Romania needs to invest as much as 40 billion euros in
installing new energy capacity of 14,800 megawatts in the next
24 years as it will probably close its outdated power plants,
which now produce half of the country’s total electricity
output, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
