The  Boston Celtics  defeated the
injury-depleted New York Knicks 96-93 to lead their National
Basketball Association Eastern Conference series by two games to
none.  Kevin Garnett  scored with 13 seconds left to give the
Celtics a 94-93 lead at TD Garden in Boston. Garnett then stole
a pass and Delonte West completed the scoring with two free
throws.  The Knicks played the second half without leading scorer
Amar’e Stoudemire, who left the game with back spasms 3 minutes,
21 seconds before halftime. Stoudemire had four points on 2-for-
9 shooting in 18 minutes of action. New York was also without
point guard  Chauncey Billups , who has a strained left knee.
Carmelo Anthony had 42 points and 17 rebounds for the Knicks,
who haven’t won a postseason game since April 29, 2001.  Also tonight, the  Orlando Magic  beat the Atlanta Hawks
88-82 to tie their Eastern Conference first-round series at one
game each.  Dwight Howard  led the Magic with 33 points and 19
rebounds at the Amway Center in Orlando. The best-of-seven
series moves to Atlanta for the next two games.  Rajon Rondo scored 30 points for the record 17-time NBA
champion Celtics, Paul Pierce had 20 and Ray Allen added 18.  It’s unclear whether Billups will be available for Game 3,
which is set for April 22 at New York’s Madison Square Garden,
Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni said before tonight’s game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
