Brazil ’s inflation rate accelerated
to its fastest since November 2008, driven by food, beverages
and fuel prices.  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index rose 6.44
percent in the year through mid-April, the  national statistics
agency  said in  Rio de Janeiro  today. Brazil’s mid-month
inflation rose 0.77 percent in April from March, in line with
the median of 41 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “Inflation is spreading,” Flavio Serrano, senior
economist at Espirito Santo Investment Bank, said in a telephone
interview from  Sao Paulo . “The central bank can’t adopt a not-
so-tight policy when there is this deterioration.”  Inflation will converge back to the government’s 4.5
percent target by the end of next year after interest rate
increases, spending cuts and the adoption of measures to curb
 consumer credit , policy makers said in their latest quarterly
inflation report.  Food and beverage prices rose 0.79 percent in April after
increasing 0.46 percent in March, fueled by higher prices of
onions, milk, potatoes, eggs and beans.the agency said,  Gasoline prices rose 4.28 percent after increasing 0.76
percent in March, after ethanol prices jumped 16.4 percent
compared with 4.68 percent the previous month. The biofuel
accounts for 25 percent of gasoline sold to consumers in Brazil.  The yield on the interest-rate future contract due in
January 2012 fell one basis points, or 0.01 percentage point, to
12.24 percent at 9:10 a.m. New York time. The real rose 0.5
percent to 1.5679 per  U.S. dollar .  Rate Increase  Traders are wagering that the central bank will raise
borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage point today to cool inflation
that is threatening to breach the bank’s target range, according
to Bloomberg estimates based on interest rate futures. Brazil
targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage
points.  The central bank must raise the benchmark interest rate by
50 basis points today for the third straight meeting, besides
assessing possible new measures to curb credit ahead, Serrano
said.  Economists raised their 2011 inflation forecast to 6.29
percent, from 6.26 percent a week earlier, according to an April
15 central bank survey of about 100 economists. Economists
expect inflation to slow to 5 percent in 2012, the survey found.  Brazilian economists estimate that the credit curbs have
the same impact on inflation as a 0.75 percentage-point interest
rate increase.  Heated Economy  Brazil’s unemployment rate rose less than economists
expected in March, reaching the lowest on record for the month,
indicating that the economy remains heated.  Unemployment in March rose to 6.5 percent from 6.4 percent
in February, below the median 6.7 percent forecast of 36
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the national statistics office
said yesterday.  Latin America’s largest economy is currently “almost at
full employment” and faces labor shortages in many industries,
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said April 18.  Brazil’s retail sales unexpectedly declined in February,
the first decline since April last year, on lower sales of
automobiles, furniture, office supplies and housing and building
materials.  Sales fell 0.4 percent in February from January, down from
a revised 1.1 percent increase the previous month, the national
statistics agency said last week. The median forecast from 30
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was that retail sales would
remain flat. Sales rose 8.2 percent in February from a year ago,
down from 8.3 percent in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
