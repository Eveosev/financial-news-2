Kenya ’s shilling snapped three days
of gains as traders bought dollars to minimize their risk
exposure before a four-day Easter holiday that will shut most
domestic banks.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy weakened 0.3
percent to 84 per dollar as of 3:20 p.m. today in the capital,
Nairobi.  “There is some inter-bank activity, with the market trying
to reduce risk exposure,” Wilson Mutai, a dealer at African
Banking Corp., said by phone from Nairobi today. Trading
activity in Kenya’s currency market will probably be subdued
over the holiday, he said.  Currency dealers who work in trading between banks are
buying dollars to “square positions ahead of the long
weekend,” Steve Lagat a dealer with CFC Stanbic Bank, said by
phone from Nairobi today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
