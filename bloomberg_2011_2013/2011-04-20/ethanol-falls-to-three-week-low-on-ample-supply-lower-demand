Ethanol futures slipped to a three-
week low in  Chicago  amid ample supply of the fuel and lower
demand for gasoline.  The grain-based additive declined after the Energy
Department reported that gasoline demand fell 1.3 percent last
week to 9.06 million barrels a day, about 1.5 percent lower than
a year earlier, and that ethanol stockpiles are up 19 percent
this year to 20.1 million barrels. The biofuel is mixed with
gasoline to stretch supply.  “They’re putting through less gasoline,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “It’s kind of a
temporary phenomenon. You’re going to have to go through these
stockpiles.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery dropped 5.2 cents, or 2
percent, to $2.569 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have risen 64 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast gained 5
cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.76 a gallon and in Chicago the
biofuel increased 2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.64, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  rose 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$2.725 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel advanced 2
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.755.  Corn futures for July delivery decreased 16.5 cents, or 2.2
percent, to close at $7.405 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel
distills into at least 2.75 gallons of the fuel.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are losing 2 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are breaking even on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
