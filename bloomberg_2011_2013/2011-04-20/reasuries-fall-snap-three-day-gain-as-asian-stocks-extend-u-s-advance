Treasuries fell, snapping a three-
day advance, as Asian stocks extended gains in U.S. shares and a
gauge of trader inflation expectations approached the highest
level since 2008.  Benchmark 10-year yields have climbed almost a quarter
percentage point from last month’s low on speculation the
economy is strong enough for the  Federal Reserve  to end its $600
billion bond-purchase program as scheduled in June. The
difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, widened to 2.65
percentage points. It was 2.67 percentage points on April 11,
the most in three years.  “I’m more bearish” on Treasuries than earlier in the
year, said Kei Katayama, leader of the foreign fixed-income
group in Tokyo at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which oversees the
equivalent of $55 billion. “The economic situation is not that
bad. We’ll see gradual, slow growth with higher inflation
pressure, especially from the commodities market.”  Ten-year yields increased two basis points to 3.38 percent
as of 11:07 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 3.625 percent note due in February 2021 declined
1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 102 1/32. Katayama said
he’s considering trimming his Treasury holdings this month.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares rose 1 percent, its
first gain in four days, after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
advanced 0.6 percent in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
