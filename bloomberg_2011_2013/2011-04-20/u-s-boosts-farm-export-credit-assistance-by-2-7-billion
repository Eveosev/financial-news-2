The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said it is adding about  $2.7 billion in funds  to support farm
exports.  The biggest single target for the export-loan credits was
 South Korea , at $650 million, according to statements released
today by the USDA. Shippers with goods for  Central and South
America , the  Middle East, Africa  and  China  could also benefit.  The departmentâ€™s  GSM-102 program  underwrites loans that
foreign banks grant for the purchase of U.S. farm products,
including corn and wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
