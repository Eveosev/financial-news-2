Japanese stocks advanced the most
in almost two weeks after U.S. housing starts increased and
earnings beat estimates at companies including Johnson & Johnson,
signaling the world’s biggest economy is recovering.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) ,  Japan ’s biggest maker of industrial robots,
gained 2.3 percent.  Toshiba Corp. (6502) ,  Advantest Corp. (6857)  and other
makers of chips and related tools advanced after  Intel Corp. (INTC) 
forecast sales that may top estimates.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the nation’s
largest oil explorer, soared 3.1 percent as crude prices rose.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 1.8 percent to 9,606.82
as of the close in  Tokyo , the biggest gain since April 8. The
broader Topix advanced 1.2 percent to 837.17. The index has
declined about 10 percent since the magnitude-9 earthquake and
tsunami on March 11 that devastated Japan’s northeast coast and
crippled a nuclear-power plant.  “You’re seeing signs the U.S. and  Europe  are still on
track for recovery,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager
at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “That’s helped to ease
nerves.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.6 percent
yesterday in  New York  after the Commerce Department said housing
starts increased 7.2 percent in March from February. Work began
on 549,000 homes, exceeding the 520,000 median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Exporters Climb  Japan’s exporters gained after the housing report. Fanuc, a
maker of factory equipment that gets about 80 percent of sales
overseas, increased 2.3 percent to 13,190 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,
Japan’s biggest exporter of electronics, rose 0.9 percent to
2,458 yen. Automakers including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Honda Motor
Co. and Nissan Motor Co. advanced.  Shares also gained after companies in the U.S. and Europe
yesterday reported results that beat projections, helping boost
confidence in the global recovery. Johnson & Johnson, the
world’s second-biggest seller of health products, forecast full-
year earnings of $4.90 to $5 a share, better than an estimate of
$4.80 to $4.90 in January.  Chip-related companies advanced after Intel, the world’s
biggest producer of semiconductors, forecast second-quarter
sales that may top analysts’ estimates. Demand for processors
for high-powered machines that handle Web services is
outweighing slower personal computer growth, the  Santa Clara ,
California-based company said.  Intel Boosts Chipmakers  Toshiba, the world’s second-largest manufacturer of chips
used to store music and photos in smartphones and other portable
devices, soared 3.7 percent to 416 yen. Advantest, the largest
maker of semiconductor-testing equipment, and  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) ,
Japan’s sole maker of PC memory, also climbed.  Toshiba got a boost after Nomura Holdings Inc. reiterated
its “buy” rating on the company, saying the chip business
would drive earnings, even as nuclear power-related sales fall
in the wake of last month’s disaster. Shares of the company,
which makes everything from semiconductors to atomic plants,
have fallen 17 percent since the quake and tsunami that caused
explosions and radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi power station.  Japan’s currency weakened, giving relief to the country’s
exporters. The yen depreciated to as low as 119.67 against the
euro today in Tokyo, compared with 117.24 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday, on speculation the  European Central Bank  will
raise  interest rates  further. Against the dollar, Japan’s
currency weakened to 83.10 from 82.44.  Oil and trading companies advanced as crude and metal
prices increased. Inpex climbed 3.1 percent to 601,000 yen after
crude oil for May delivery gained $1.03 to settle at $108.15 a
barrel yesterday in New York.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s biggest
commodities trader, advanced after the London Metal Exchange
Index of six metals had its biggest gain in almost two weeks.  To contact the reporters for this story:
