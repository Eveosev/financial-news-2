Russia’s winter grains harvest this
year may be between 33 million and 35 million metric tons due to
sufficient snow, good crop conditions and sufficient moisture in
the soil, according to the  Institute for Agricultural Market
Studies , or Ikar.  In the south, only 3 percent of winter plantings may be
ruined, less than an earlier forecast of between 4 and 5
percent, Ikar analyst Oleg Sukhanov said today by phone. In
central Russia, winter-crop loss may be 7 percent, down from an
earlier forecast of 9 to 10 percent, he said.  A “difficult” situation persists in the Volga area, where
as much as 25 percent of the country’s winter grains are
traditionally harvested, because “autumn sowing was bad and
winter weather conditions worsened the shape of crops,”
Sukhanov said. “Harsh temperature fluctuations led to an ice
crust in the fields there in the winter.”  Up to 30 percent of winter crops may be lost in the  Volga
area, compared with an average 15 percent, and the harvest may
be 8.5 million tons there, he said. Ikar has forecast  Russia ’s
total grain harvest at between 80 and 88 million tons in 2011.
The total harvest was 60.9 million tons in 2010 after the
country’s worst drought in a half century damaged crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
