president of Clearwater, owns a minority interest in Reconcile,
according to the filing.  Brightwater Club  is described on a  website  as a private
gated community of 963 acres in the Gypsum Creek Valley 35 miles

ponds, trails and a golf course.  The largest listed creditor is Kennedy Funding Inc., with a

unsecured.  The case is Clearwater Development Inc., 11-18725, U.S.
