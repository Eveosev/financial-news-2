EBay Inc. (EBAY) , owner of the world’s
largest e-commerce marketplace, has acquired WHERE Inc., a
service that lets mobile-phone users get information about
nearby businesses, a person familiar with the matter said.  WHERE , based in  Boston , helps more than 4 million active
users recommend favorite stores, restaurants and other local
establishments. EBay won’t disclose terms of the deal, which may
be announced as soon as today, said the person, who asked to
remain anonymous because the deal hasn’t been made public.  EBay will use the takeover to expand beyond its online
commerce site and reach consumers as they shop in brick-and-
mortar stores or search for items via smartphones. The company
said in December that it bought Milo.com, a service that helps
people find items in nearby shops.  EBay, based in  San Jose ,  California , has more than $6.5
billion in cash and short-term investments and raised $1.5
billion in debt in October. The company also announced plans in
March to acquire GSI Commerce Inc. for $2.4 billion.  PayPal, an online-payments service owned by EBay, is also
preparing to expand into storefronts and hired Blackhawk Network
founder Don Kingsborough in March to oversee that push.  John Pluhowski, a spokesman for EBay, declined to comment.  EBay rose 68 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $31.83 at 9:36 a.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It had risen 12
percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
