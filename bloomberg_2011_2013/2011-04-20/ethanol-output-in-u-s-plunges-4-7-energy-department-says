U.S. ethanol production tumbled 4.7
percent to a six-month low of 856,000 barrels a day last week,
according to the Energy Department. The decline was the steepest
since December.  Stockpiles dipped 2.1 percent to 20.1 million barrels from
a record 20.5 million last week, the department said in a report
released in  Washington .  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
rose 1.7 percent to 4.98 million barrels a day. Refiners receive
a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into
the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery climbed 1.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.636 a gallon at 10:34 a.m. New York time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have climbed 68 percent in
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
