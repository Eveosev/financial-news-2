United Arab Emirates Foreign
Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan warned that no one
“is above the law,” when asked about the recent arrests of
several pro-democracy activists.  “The prosecution in the U.A.E. has sent subpoenas to a
number of people,” Sheikh Abdullah said in  Abu Dhabi  today.
‘This is fully in procedure with laws and rules of U.A.E. We
have full trust in our judiciary and I do not believe that any
person is above the law.” He didn’t elaborate on the charges or
say how many people have been arrested.  At least four pro-democracy activists have been arrested
this month, according to lawyer Mohamed al-Mansouri. The
activists include Nasser bin Ghaith, an economics professor at
the Abu Dhabi branch of  France ’s Sorbonne University and
Abdullah bin Qious Al-Shehhi, a former army officer, al-Mansouri
said.  The U.A.E. has been spared in the wave of protests taking
place across the Arab world this year. The government said March
2 that it would allocate 5.7 billion dirhams ($1.6 billion) to
fund water and infrastructure projects in the country’s northern
emirates, which have traditionally lagged behind the rapid
development of others such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
