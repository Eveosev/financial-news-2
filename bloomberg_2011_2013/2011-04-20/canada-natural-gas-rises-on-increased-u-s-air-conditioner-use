Canadian natural-gas prices rose as
hot weather in the U.S. South boosts air-conditioner use and
demand for power-plant fuels.  Cooling needs across the U.S. will be 70 percent above
normal tomorrow and top out at 77 percent higher April 24,
according to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives.
Temperatures in Houston may touch 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32
Celsius) today, about 10 degrees hotter than normal, said
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  “There are some warmer-than-normal temperatures in the
southern U.S.,” said  Tim Evans , energy analyst for Citi Futures
Perspective in  New York . Natural gas is facing less competition
from nuclear plants because of seasonal maintenance, he said.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
jumped 14.46 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $4.574 per million
British thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance
is an express line that can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a
day to the Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas gained 2 cents to $4.1213, according to ICE. At
Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas was up 4.56 cents to $4.2217.  Alberta  gas for May delivery rose 6 cents to C$3.52 per
gigajoule ($3.50 per million Btu) as of 1:45 p.m. New York time,
according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the
exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and is priced on
TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Nymex Trading  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained 4.8 cents to $4.312 per million Btu as of 2:09
p.m.  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3 billion cubic
feet as of 12:30 p.m. in New York, about 5 million below its
target level.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.75 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.8 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 586 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.93 billion cubic feet today, about 77 percent of its
capacity of 2.51 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.83
billion cubic feet at 12:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
