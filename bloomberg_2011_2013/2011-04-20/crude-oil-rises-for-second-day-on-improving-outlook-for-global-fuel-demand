Oil rose for a second day in  New
York  before a weekly U.S. government report on supply levels,
amid signs that recovery in the world’s biggest economy is
supporting fuel consumption.  Futures gained as much as 1.6 percent as the dollar traded
near its weakest level against the euro in a more than a year,
boosting the appeal of commodities to protect against inflation.
The Energy Department will release its report today. The
industry-funded American Petroleum Institute said yesterday that
gasoline inventories fell 1.8 million barrels to 212.7 million.
European equities rose, with the Stoxx 600 adding 1.6 percent.  “There is generally better sentiment for risk assets as
equity markets rise,” said  Hannes Loacker , an analyst with
Raiffeisen Bank AG in Vienna. “Oil fundamentals still look OK
in the emerging markets. However, a price of $120 to $130 will
probably dampen demand. The high oil price may become the
biggest risk in itself.”  Oil for June delivery rose as much as $1.71 to $109.86 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $109.61 at
1:24 p.m.  London  time.  Brent crude  for June settlement climbed
$1.36, or 1.1 percent, to $122.69 a barrel on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London.  Brent’s premium over the U.S. benchmark narrowed for a
second days, to $13.04 a barrel. Yesterday, crude in New York
added 59 cents to $108.28, the highest settlement price since
April 15.  U.S. Economy  Purchases of existing U.S. homes climbed 2.5 percent in
March after dropping 9.6 percent in February, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before the National Association of
Realtors report today.  A Commerce Department report yesterday showed work began on
549,000 houses at an annual pace, up 7.2 percent from the prior
month and exceeding the 520,000 median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The weaker  U.S. dollar  and stronger equities offset
concerns over European sovereign debt and slowing demand from
high  oil prices ,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in
a note today.  The Dollar Index, a measure of the currency versus those of
six U.S. trading partners, slid for a second day to 74.68,
Bloomberg data showed. It is down 5.5 percent since the start of
the year. A decline in the dollar makes commodities priced in
the U.S. currency more attractive for investors. The U.S.
currency was at $1.4468 against the euro.  U.S. Stockpiles  U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose 667,000 barrels last week to
356.1 million, according to the industry-funded  American
Petroleum Institute . An Energy Department report today may show
supplies increased 1.3 million barrels from 359.3 million,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  The Commerce Department said work began on 549,000 houses
at an annual pace, up 7.2 percent from the prior month and
exceeding the 520,000 median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.6
percent to 1,312.62 at the 4 p.m. close in New York.  Oil has advanced 20 percent in New York this year. Unrest
in the Middle East and North  Africa  has toppled leaders in Egypt
and Tunisia and spread to  Libya , Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Oman,
Syria and Yemen. Libyan crude output, which averaged 1.6 million
barrels a day last year, shrank to 390,000 barrels a day in
March, according to a Bloomberg News survey of producers,
analysts and companies.  Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan  suspended his interior
minister after protests against his election victory killed at
least six people in Africa’s biggest oil producer. Clashes
between Christians and Muslims broke out for a second day in the
northern city of Kaduna, Shehu Sani, head of the Civil Rights
Congress, said April 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
