Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d., the
largest publicly traded retail chain in the Balkans, rose the
most in a month in Ljubljana after Agrokor d.d. of  Croatia  said
it has improved its offer for the Slovenian company.  Mercator advanced 3.70 euros, or 2.2 percent, to close at
169.90 euros on the Ljubljana stock exchange after climbing as
much as 3.5 percent. The stock has gained 7.7 percent this year,
giving Mercator a market value of 640 million euros ($929
million).  Agrokor d.d. President Ivica Todoric said yesterday
Croatiaâ€™s largest private company increased the offer for a 23
percent stake in Mercator to 221 euros a share. The Mercator
holding is being sold by  Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d. as the
Slovenian drinks company seeks to cut debt.  -- Editors: Tim Farrand, Peter Woodifield  To contact the reporter on this story:
