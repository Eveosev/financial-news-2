Swaziland’s labor unions will hold
protests each month to push for a democratic political system,
said Quinton Dlamini, president of the National Public Service
and Allied Workers Union.  The unions rejected a government plan to cut state wages as
part of measures to deal with a fiscal crisis, Dlamini said
today by phone from Mbabane, the capital. The decisions follow a
meeting of main labor unions to discuss the government’s
reaction to a three-day protest.  The Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions, Swaziland
National Association of Teachers and Swaziland Federation of
Labour agreed to join to form the Trade Union Confederation of
Swaziland, he said.  Police detained union leaders and journalists and used
teargas, rubber bullets and water cannons last week to break up
marches in support of democracy in Swaziland,  Africa ’s third-
largest sugar producer.  The government plans to raise taxes, cut budget spending
and reduce civil servants salaries to ease a  budget crisis . The
country, wedged between  South Africa  and Mozambique, is sub-
Saharan Africa’s last absolute monarchy, ruled by King Mswati III.  The youth wing of South Africa’s ruling  African National
Congress  called in an e-mailed statement today for a boycott of
Swaziland goods and for South African companies to stop doing
business with the country to help isolate Mswati.  To contact the reporter on this story:
