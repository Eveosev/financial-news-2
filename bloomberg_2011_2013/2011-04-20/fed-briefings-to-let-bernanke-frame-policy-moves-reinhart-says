Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will be able to frame policy decisions before other
officials by holding regular press conferences, which start this
month, according to the Fed’s former monetary affairs director.  The briefings will enable Bernanke to concentrate his power
inside the Fed system while ensuring reporters greater equality
of access to the central bank,  Vincent Reinhart , now a resident
scholar at the  American Enterprise Institute  in Washington, said
today on Bloomberg Radio’s “The Hays Advantage.”  The Fed chairman holds the first briefing on April 27,
after the Federal Open Market Committee releases a statement at
the conclusion of a two-day meeting. He will get the opportunity
to alter market expectations by being the first official to
explain any central-bank actions.  “It’s his opportunity to frame the policy decision,”
Reinhart said in an interview. Fed officials are “committed”
to completing the $600 billion Treasury-securities purchase
program through June and could simply “just change the date on
the last statement and send that out,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
