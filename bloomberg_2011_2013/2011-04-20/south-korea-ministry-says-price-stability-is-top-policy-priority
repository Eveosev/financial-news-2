The South Korean government will
continue to pursue  price stability  as its top policy priority as
 oil prices  may stay high for some time, the  finance ministry 
said.  The ministry will closely watch how developments in Japan
and the Middle East affect the local economy, it said in a
report prepared for parliament today. The ministry, in Gwacheon,
south of Seoul, will take prompt action to absorb any external
shocks if needed, it said.  Oil and food costs have pushed consumer inflation above the
central bank’s 4 percent ceiling each month since the start of
2011, prompting policy makers to raise interest rates by a
quarter of a percentage point in January and again in March. The
government has stepped up price controls by freezing power and
gas charges and by pressing companies to cut gasoline costs and
mobile phone fees.  Consumer prices climbed 4.7 percent from a year earlier in
March, the biggest increase since October 2008. Bank of Korea
Governor Kim Choong Soo said on April 12 that high inflation
will likely persist in coming months and that he will take
monetary-policy action “neither too slowly nor too fast.”  President  Lee Myung Bak  declared a “war” against
inflation in January and said it should be capped at 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
