Shareholders of CIG Pannonia
Eletbiztosito Nyrt., a Hungarian life insurance company,
authorized an increase in the company’s capital, opening the way
for GEM Global Yield Fund to boost its stake in line with an
earlier agreement,  Napi Gazdasag  reported.  The Switzerland-registered U.S. fund signed an agreement in
January to invest as much as 20 million euros ($29 million) in
CIG Pannonia during the next three years, the newspaper said.
GEM has an option to buy an extra 4 million shares if CIG’s
share price development meets set conditions, Napi said.  The Budapest-based company expects to break even by 2014
after booking a net loss of 6.4 billion forint ($35 million)
last year, the newspaper said, citing Bela Horvath, the
chairman.  To contact the reporters on this story:
