German electricity for delivery
next year rose for the first day in three after fuels advanced,
signaling higher costs for power stations in  Europe ’s biggest
market.  Baseload power for 2012 climbed 70 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to 59 euros ($83), according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg as of 6 p.m. Berlin time. Baseload is delivered around
the clock.  The contract earlier this month climbed to its highest
price since June 2009 after  Germany  shut nuclear reactors for a
safety review after the nuclear disaster in Japan.  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp also rose for the first day in three, advancing 1.4
percent to $130.75 a metric ton. The fuel accounted for about a
fifth of Germany’s power last year. Germany also produces
electricity from lignite, or brown coal, natural gas, wind and
solar plants.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
