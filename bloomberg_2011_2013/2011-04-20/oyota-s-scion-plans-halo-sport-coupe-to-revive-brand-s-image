(Corrects name of concept car in second paragraph of story
published April 20.)  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Scion line
plans to add a new sports car to its U.S. offerings next year in
a bet that a more expensive, high-performance model will boost
sales and interest in the brand.  The FR-S concept car unveiled at the  New York  International
Auto Show today will be the basis for the rear-wheel-drive Scion
car due sometime in 2012, said Jack Hollis, head of sales for
the brand. The car results from Toyota’s collaboration with Fuji
Heavy Industries Ltd., which makes Subaru brand autos and is 16
percent owned by Toyota.  “This is a halo car for our brand,” Hollis said in an
interview today in New York. “It’s going to stretch us further
as a brand.”  Scion, begun in 2003 to attract younger buyers with
unconventional designs and prices lower than $20,000, had annual
sales peak at 173,034 in 2006. Deliveries of xB wagons, xD
hatchbacks and tC sport coupes dropped to 45,678 last year.  Sales for Scion have risen 33 percent this year through
March, aided by a new version of tC that went on sale last year.
The brand also is adding the iQ minicar this year, which was
delayed because of production disruptions from the earthquake in
 Japan , Hollis said.  The new sports car will be priced higher than the tC and
less than $30,000, Hollis said, without being more specific.
Outside of the U.S., the model will be sold as a Toyota brand
vehicle, he said.  Toyota is considering adding a sports car derived from the
FR-S concept to its U.S. lineup,  Bob Carter , U.S. group vice
president, said today in New York, without elaborating.  Scion is based in Torrance,  California , at Toyota’s U.S.
sales unit.  Toyota’s American depositary receipts, each representing
two ordinary shares, rose $1.14, or 1.5 percent, to $77.26 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
