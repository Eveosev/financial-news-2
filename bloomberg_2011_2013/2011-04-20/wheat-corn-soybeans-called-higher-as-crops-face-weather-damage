What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 15 cents to 18 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade
and the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  as adverse weather threatens
to reduce yields in the U.S., China, Canada and Europe, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.  -- Corn futures are called to open 10 cents to 14 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on speculation that wet, cool weather forecast
over the next 10 days in the Midwest will slow planting and the
emergence of plants on fields already seeded, Gerlach said.  -- Soybean futures may open 13 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT as adverse weather may reduce production in the
Northern Hemisphere, while improving economic growth in emerging
nations boosts demand for  animal feed  and cooking oil, Gerlach
said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.55 cent to 0.7
cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open up $2 to
$3 for 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
