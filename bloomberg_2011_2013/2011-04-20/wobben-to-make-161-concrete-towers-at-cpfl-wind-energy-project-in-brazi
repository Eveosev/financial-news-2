Wobben Windpower, a unit of the
German wind power equipment maker Enercon GmbH, will manufacture
161 concrete towers for  CPFL Energia SA (CPFE3)  and  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4) ’s wind projects in  Brazil ’s north.  The towers will be produced in segments from a factory
built at the site of the Sao Paulo-based energy company CPFL
Energia’s 188-megawatt wind project in Parazinho, Eduardo Lopes,
commercial director of Wobben, said in an e-mail.  The heaviness of each segment means it’s advantageous to
produce them near the site, Lopes said. “You save money on
transport.”  Wobben has opted for concrete towers instead of the steel
that’s used at most other Brazilian wind farms because they’re
cheaper to make, which means you can build them higher and
harness stiffer winds, he said.  Another advantage is that the developer won’t be dependent
on the schedules of sub-suppliers as concrete is made from
cement, sand, gravel and water that are readily available, he
said.  The factory, which started at the beginning of this month,
will furnish Petroleo Brasileiro, known as Petrobras, with
towers for its 104-megawatt wind farm in Guamare and possibly
other projects in the region, Lopes said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
