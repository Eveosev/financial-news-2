Carol Lin, a managing director who
headed the sourcing and distribution platform in Asia for loans,
distressed and stressed assets at  Morgan Stanley (MS) , has left the
bank, according to three people with knowledge of the move.  She will join  Barclays Capital , the investment banking unit
of  Barclays Plc (BARC) , as a so-called senior distressed-debt sourcer,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the move
hasn’t been announced publicly.  Noel Cheung, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, confirmed Lin’s
departure and declined further comment. Lin said in an e-mail
she has resigned from Morgan Stanley and declined further
comment.  This is the second managing director Barclays has hired for
distressed-debt trading in the past year. The London-based bank
hired Peter Benoist as head of distressed loan trading from
Deutsche Bank AG in New York last year.  Lin, who will be based in  New York , will report to Dan Crowley, head of distressed-debt trading at Barclays, the people
said. Erica Chase, a Barclays spokeswoman, declined to comment.  A sourcer is someone who locates and purchases distressed
loans, bonds or claims for a bank’s trading group and its
clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
