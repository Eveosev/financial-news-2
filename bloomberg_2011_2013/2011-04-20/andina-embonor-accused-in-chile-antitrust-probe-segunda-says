Chilean Coca-Cola bottlers
 Embotelladora Andina SA (AKO/A)  and  Coca-Cola Embonor SA (EMBONOA)  have been
accused by  Chile ’s national economic prosecutor of abusing their
dominant market position, La Segunda reported.  The prosecutor, known as the FNE, accused Andina and
Embonor of blocking the entry of new participants, the Santiago-
based newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the
process who it didn’t identify. The FNE asked for a fine of $10
million for the companies, La Segunda said, without elaborating.  Karen Calcagno, an FNE press officer, told Bloomberg News
that the prosecutor’s policy is not to comment on cases that
haven’t been formally accepted by Chile’s antitrust tribunal and
posted on its website.  Gerardo Cohen, Andina’s corporate legal manager, wasn’t
available to comment, an assistant said by phone. Mauricio
Contreras, an external public relations representative of
Embonor, didn’t respond to two phone calls and an e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
