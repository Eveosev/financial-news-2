Russia will spend more than 700
billion rubles ($25 billion) this year on roads and about 350
billion rubles on railways, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said,
citing the need to upgrade transport infrastructure to spur
economic development.  Russia will build about 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) of
new federal and regional roads over the next five years and will
upgrade all federal highways by 2020, Putin said in an address
to the State Duma today. Russia will also spend more than 300
billion rubles by 2015 on airport infrastructure, he said.  “Over the next decade we have to lay down the new
infrastructure base for the country,” Putin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
