India ’s rupee rose, snapping a two-
day decline, on speculation exporters will sell dollars to take
advantage of the local currency’s decline to a one-week low
yesterday.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index climbed 1
percent, the most in a week. That raised optimism that overseas
investors are buying more of the nation’s assets, said  Roy Paul ,
deputy general manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  “Some exporters may see this as an opportunity to convert
earnings because the stock market’s trend is bringing in some
positivity for the currency,” he said.  The rupee strengthened 0.1 percent to 44.435 per dollar as
of 11:08 in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 44.700 yesterday, the weakest since April 7.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.18 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.29
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
