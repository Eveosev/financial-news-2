Belgian  consumer confidence  rose in
April, partially recovering from March’s steepest decline in 10
months, as households’ assessments of the economic outlook and
their personal financial situations improved.  The consumer sentiment index for  Belgium , the euro region’s
sixth-largest economy, increased to minus 1 from minus 2 in
March, the Brussels-based National Bank of Belgium said today in
an e-mailed statement. A sub-index gauging households’
assessment of the economy in the coming year increased to minus
1 from minus 5 in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
