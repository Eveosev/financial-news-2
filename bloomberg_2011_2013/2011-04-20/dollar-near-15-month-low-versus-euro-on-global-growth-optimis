The dollar slid to a record against
the Australian dollar and touched the lowest level in 16 months
versus the euro as signs of sustained global growth boosted
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The greenback depreciated to the weakest in at least 40
years versus the Swiss franc and lows of two years or more
against the Swedish krona, the South Korean won and the New
Zealand dollar on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will lag
behind other central banks in raising  interest rates .  “Fed policy is going to stay the way it is for some
time,” said  Mary Nicola , a currency strategist at BNP Paribas
SA in New York. “You’re looking to capture yield, so you’re
going to move out of the dollar, which is lower-yielding, and
move into something that’s higher-yielding.”  The dollar depreciated 0.2 percent to $1.4556 versus the
euro at 3:59 p.m. in New York, from $1.4523 yesterday, extending
this week’s decline to 0.9 percent. It earlier slid to $1.4649,
the weakest level since December 2009. The greenback dropped 0.9
percent to 81.82 yen, from 82.56, after touching 81.62, the
lowest level since March 29. The yen appreciated 0.7 percent to
119.10 versus the euro, from 119.90.  Sterling rallied against the dollar as a report showed
retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2 percent in March as spending
on food surged. The median forecast of 20 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.5 percent decline.  Gain in Pound  The pound gained 0.5 percent to 88.07 pence against the
euro and advanced 0.7 percent to $1.6528 after touching $1.6599,
the highest level in 16 months.  Australia ’s dollar climbed as much as 0.6 percent to
$1.0775, the strongest level since it was freely floated in
1983, before trading at $1.0745, compared with $1.0714.  Producer prices in Australia rose 1.2 percent in the first
quarter after a 0.1 percent gain in the prior three months, the
Bureau of Statistics said. The median forecast of 14 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 1 percent gain.  Australian Foreign Minister  Kevin Rudd  ruled out
intervention in the Aussie, which has gained 16 percent in the
past year against the greenback. Spurred by revenue from
shipments of coal and iron ore to  China , the currency’s surge
has hurt Australian tourism, manufacturing and education.  “We are not in the business of regulating exchange
rates,” Rudd told Bloomberg Television at his Brisbane office
yesterday. “We don’t intend to drift back to anything which
seeks to manipulate our exchange rate.”  ECB Rate Outlook  The euro rose earlier against the dollar on speculation the
 European Central Bank  will boost its main refinancing rate
further after increasing it on April 7 for the first time since
the financial crisis.  Spain ’s 2.49 billion euros ($3.63 billion) offering
yesterday of 10-year bonds drew higher demand, damping
speculation the nation will require a bailout.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback versus the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, dropped as much as 0.9 percent to 73.735, the
lowest level since August 2008.  The Fed isn’t expected to increase its target lending rate
until the first quarter of 2012, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “The dollar is paralyzed, absolutely paralyzed by the
low-rate structure here while the rest of the world is hiking
rates,”  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency strategist at
Westpac Banking Corp. in  New York , said in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  Multiyear Lows  The dollar fell to multiyear lows against the Swiss franc,
Sweden’s krona, the South Korean won, New Zealand’s kiwi and
 Canada ’s dollar.  The U.S. currency sank to a record low against the franc,
touching 87.81 centimes, the weakest level since at least 1971,
when Bloomberg records start.  Sweden’s krona appreciated as much as 0.9 percent to 6.0736
versus the dollar, the strongest level since August 2008, a day
after the Riksbank raised its benchmark lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point to 1.75 percent.  The won reached 1,078.30 per dollar, the strongest level
since September 2008. The kiwi, as  New Zealand ’s currency is
known, reached 80.38 U.S. cents, the highest since March 2008,
and the loonie touched 94.55 cents per  U.S. dollar , the
strongest level November 2007.  The euro pared its gain on reduced risk demand as reports
showed the U.S. economic recovery may be losing momentum.
Initial claims for jobless benefits fell less than economists
forecast, the Labor Department reported. Manufacturing in the
Philadelphia region slowed more than forecast as measures of
orders and sales dropped, the Philadelphia Fed reported.  “The slight disappointment on the U.S. data side led to a
little bit less optimism and a little bit of a decline in risk
appetite,” said  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at
 Wells Fargo & Co . in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
