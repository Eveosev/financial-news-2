South Africa  aims to attract 15
million foreign tourists annually by 2020, up from 7 million in
2009, Tourism Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk said.  The government wants tourism’s contribution to the economy
to increase to 499 billion rand ($73 billion) by 2020, up from
189 billion rand in 2009, Van Schalkwyk said in a speech to
lawmakers in Cape Town today. South Africa attracted 8.07
