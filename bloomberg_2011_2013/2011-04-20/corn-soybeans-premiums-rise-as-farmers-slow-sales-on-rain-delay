Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped in April to terminals near  New Orleans  declined relative
to Chicago futures after adverse weather threatened to delay
planting, prompting farmers to slow sales.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 54 cents to 60 cents a bushel above May futures,
compared with 54 cents to 57 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis for April deliveries
rose to 64 cents to 68 cents a bushel from 58 cents to 67 cents.
The average premium, 66 cents, is the highest in almost four
weeks.  “The basis is firmer because of slow farmer selling as
many remain nervous about planting delays,” said Tim Emslie,
the research director for Country Hedging Inc. in Inver Grove
Heights,  Minnesota . “Exporters are raising bids to get
elevators to sell some inventories.”  Corn futures for May delivery fell 16.25 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $7.3275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 15.75 cents to
$13.5775 a bushel, the highest settlement for the contract since
April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
