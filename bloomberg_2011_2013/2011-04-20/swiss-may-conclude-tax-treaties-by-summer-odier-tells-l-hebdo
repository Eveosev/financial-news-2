Switzerland  may agree a withholding
tax with the U.K. and  Germany  by the Summer, Swiss Bankers
Association Chairman Patrick Odier was cited as saying in an
interview with L’Hebdo.  “We hope the negotiation will end in the summer,” Odier
told the Lausanne, Switzerland-based magazine in an e-mailed
pre-release of the interview.  Odier was commenting on talks over a tax that raises
revenue from offshore Swiss bank accounts while keeping client
identities secret.  To contact the reporter on this story:
