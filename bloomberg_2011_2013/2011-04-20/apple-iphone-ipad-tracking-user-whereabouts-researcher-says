Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and iPad track
and store the movements of people using the devices, according
to a report by O’Reilly Radar.  Apple’s iOS 4 operating system for the iPhone and iPad 3G
logs latitude-longitude coordinates along with the time of the
visit, according to Alasdair Allan, a senior research fellow in
astronomy at the University of Exeter in England, who co-wrote
the study with Pete Warden. The findings were posted on the
 website  owned by O’Reilly Media, a Sebastopol, California-based
publisher that organizes technology trade conferences.  The tracking, which is likely based on the location of
nearby mobile-phone towers, raises security and privacy
questions, Allan and Warden wrote. The information, which can
total tens of thousands of data points, isn’t encrypted,
according to the authors, who were going to present the results
today at the  Where 2.0  conference in  Santa Clara , California.  There’s no evidence the information is being shared,
according to the report. Mobile phone carriers have always had
access to this information and it takes a court order for it to
be accessed, the authors said.  Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, didn’t immediately
return a telephone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
