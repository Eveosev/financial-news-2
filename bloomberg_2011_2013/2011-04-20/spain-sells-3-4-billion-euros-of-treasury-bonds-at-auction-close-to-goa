Spain  sold 3.4 billion euros ($4.9
billion) of bonds and demand rose even as its borrowing costs
increased amid expectations Greece may restructure its debt.  The Treasury said it sold 2.49 billion euros of 10-year
bonds at an average yield of 5.472 percent, compared with 5.162
percent at the previous auction on March 17. It also sold 885
million euros of bonds maturing Jan. 31, 2024 at 5.667 percent.  Demand for the 10-year benchmark bonds was 2.1 times the
amount sold, compared with 1.81 last month, and the bid-to-cover
ratio for the 2024 debt was 2.27. The Treasury aimed to sell a
maximum of 3.5 billion euros.  Spain is trying to distance itself from other so-called
peripheral economies as investors increase bets that Greece will
be forced to restructure its debt. Finance Minister Elena Salgado played down yesterday the surge in Spain’s borrowing
costs to three-month highs, saying economic “fundamentals” are
unchanged from last week and the government will press ahead
with cutting the deficit and forcing struggling savings banks to
bolster capital.  “It’s somewhat a relief, they cleared it quite
comfortably,”  Orlando Green , a strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in  London , said. “The authorities
are doing what they can to at least try to convince the market
that they are on the path to a more sustainable position.”  Spread Narrows  The 10-year debt was sold at a lower yield than the 5.516
percent on the secondary market before the auction. That yield
fell to 5.464 percent after the sale, and the euro strengthened
1.2 percent to 1.4501 against the dollar.  The gap between Spanish and German 10-year yields narrowed
to 215 basis points from 223 basis points yesterday. That
compares with a euro-era record of 298 basis points on Nov. 30,
after Ireland became the second euro nation following  Greece  to
seek a European Union bailout, and an average of 15 basis points
in the first decade of monetary union.  Spain is implementing the deepest budget cuts in at least
three decades and overhauling laws on labor, wages and pensions
as it seeks to rein in the region’s third-largest budget deficit
and steer the economy back to growth after a three-year slump.  While Greek Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said
on April 16 that his nation has no plans to restructure its debt
and French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  also ruled out a
restructuring yesterday, German officials have openly discussed
the possibility. Greece will probably have to restructure its
debt, and bond buybacks are a possible solution, Lars Feld, a
member of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council of economic
advisers, told Deutschlandfunk radio today.  Greece paid 4.1 percent to sell 13-week Treasury bills
yesterday, as its two-year yields rose above 20 percent to a
euro-era record.  To contact the reporters on this story:
