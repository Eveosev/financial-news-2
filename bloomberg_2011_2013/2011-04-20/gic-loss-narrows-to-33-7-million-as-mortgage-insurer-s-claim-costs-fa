MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG)  led mortgage
insurers lower after the company posted its third straight loss,
missing analysts’ estimates, and said it may become less
successful rejecting claims it believes are unjustified.  MGIC, the largest U.S. guarantor of home loans, dropped 94
cents, or 11 percent, to $7.45 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. No. 2  Radian Group Inc. (RDN)  fell 9.9
percent and  PMI Group Inc. (PMI)  fell 10 percent.  Mortgage insurers pay lenders when homeowners default and
foreclosures fail to recoup costs. The benefit from rejected
claims, or rescissions, was about $200 million in the first
quarter, compared with annual totals of about $1.2 billion in
2009 and 2010 the company said today. The operating loss, which
excludes some investment results, was 20 cents a share, missing
by 7 cents the average estimate of eight analysts.  “Rescissions will not continue at the same rates, as a
percentage of claims received, we have previously experienced,”
the Milwaukee-based company said today in a statement.  The net loss was $33.7 million for the company, which has
been unprofitable in 14 of the past 15 quarters. Book value per
share, a measure of assets minus liabilities used by analysts
and investors, slipped to $8 from $8.33 as of December 31.  MGIC has dropped 27 percent this year in New York trading,
beating the 33 percent fall at Philadelphia-based Radian and 44
percent plunge at PMI. Walnut Creek, California-based PMI and
Radian are scheduled to report first-quarter results on May 5
and each company is expected to post an operating loss,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  U.S. home prices fell 3.9 percent in January from a year
earlier as the housing market struggled to recover from the
worst crash in seven decades.  Until 2007, private mortgage policies had been among the
most profitable types of coverage sold by insurers. From 2000 to
2006, members of the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America
reported a profit margin of at least 35 cents for every dollar
collected in premiums.  To contact the reporter on this story:
