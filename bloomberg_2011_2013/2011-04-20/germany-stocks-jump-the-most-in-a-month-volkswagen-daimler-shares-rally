German stocks rallied the most in
almost 11 months as earnings from France’s PSA Peugeot Citroen
boosted investor optimism in the outlook for carmakers and
chemical and technology companies rose.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Daimler AG (DAI)  surged more than 4 percent as
a gauge of automakers posted the best performance of 19 industry
groups in the benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.  BASF SE (BAS) , the
world’s largest chemicals company, jumped to an 18-year high.
 Infineon Technologies AG (IFX)  rallied after Intel Corp.’s second-
quarter sales forecast topped analysts’ estimates.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  soared 209.88, or 3 percent, to 7,249.19 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt, the biggest jump since May 27.
The gauge has climbed 11 percent from this year’s low on March
16 as investors speculated that the global economic recovery
will withstand Japan’s March 11 quake and popular revolts in the
Middle East and north Africa. The broader  HDAX Index (HDAX)  increased
2.9 percent today.  “Earnings are coming in as strong as projected,” Andre Wallenhorst, a trader at Nord LB in Hannover, Germany said.
“The market is completely ignoring the sovereign debt crisis,
the ongoing unrest in the Middle East and ever-climbing
commodities.”  Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker, rose 4.8 percent to
118.4 euros, the largest gain in two months. Peugeot posted
first-quarter revenue of 15.4 billion euros ($22.2 billion),
beating the average analyst estimate for sales of 14 billion
euros. France’s biggest automaker also reiterated its full-year
forecast, helped by the introduction of vehicles such as the
Citroen DS3 minicar.  VW in  China   Separately, Volkswagen plans to double the size of its
factories in China, Weiming Soh, VW’s China sales chief, said at
a forum in  Shanghai  today.  Daimler, a maker of luxury cars, advanced 4.2 percent to
51.12 euros.  Gauges of European chemicals and technology companies both
rallied more than 2.5 percent today, helping pull German
equities higher. BASF soared 4.8 percent to 65.3 euros, the
highest close since at least August 1992.  Infineon, Europe’s second-largest chipmaker, climbed 4.3
percent to 7.45 euros.  Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, forecast second-
quarter revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million.
That beat the $11.9 billion average estimate in a survey of
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  surged 4.1 percent to 30.03 euros as
JPMorgan Chase & Co. recommended the steelmaker.  A “reversal of losses at Steel Americas and non-steel
divisions earnings” will lead to “outperformance versus plain-
vanilla steel peers,” Alessandro Abate, an analyst at the bank,
wrote in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
