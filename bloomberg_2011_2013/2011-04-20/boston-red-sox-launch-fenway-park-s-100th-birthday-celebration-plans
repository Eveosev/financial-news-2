Fenway Park turns 100 years old
next year and the Boston  Red Sox  have started making plans to
celebrate  Major League Baseball ’s oldest stadium.  On the 99th anniversary of the first game played at Fenway,
the Red Sox today unveiled a new 2012 stadium logo and website,
where fans can join in the planning process by sharing memories
and stories of the ballpark.  The Red Sox have invested more than $285 million over the
past decade to upgrade the stadium, including seats above the
36-foot-high left-field wall known as the Green Monster. The
100-year celebration will highlight Red Sox history and
commemorate the sports, music, civic and community events hosted
at Fenway Park.  “With a celebration built around the sentiments and ideas
of our fans, we plan to honor this iconic ballpark’s connection
to  New England  and a nation,” Red Sox Chairman  Tom Werner  said
in a statement.  The stadium’s new website,  www.fenwaypark100.com , features
information, photos and video on Fenway Park’s architecture and
history. The Red Sox have also launched the sale of
commemorative seats from Fenway Park and 100th anniversary
bricks with personalized messages that will be placed in the
stadium’s concourse area.  “The preservation of this ballpark has been an issue of
paramount importance to our ownership group,” Red Sox principal
owner  John Henry  said. “Without a doubt, Fenway Park is
renowned for its architectural and aesthetic charm. But the
character of this ballpark has always been a reflection of the
fans who call it home.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
