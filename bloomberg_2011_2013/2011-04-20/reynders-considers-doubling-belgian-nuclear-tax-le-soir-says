Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  is considering doubling a levy on owners of nuclear
power-generation capacity in  Belgium  from a combined 250 million
euros ($360 million) to 500 million euros,  Le Soir  reported,
citing an interview with the minister.  “It would not be unreasonable to double the tax,”
Reynders told Le Soir. “I believe that 500 million is a
realistic figure, provided that we stabilize the system by
indexing deductions according to European energy prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
