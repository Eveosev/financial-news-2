Taiwan ’s dollar gained the most in
almost two weeks on optimism the global economic recovery is
intact after housing starts in the U.S. rose more than
economists predicted.  The currency snapped a three-day decline after the U.S.
Commerce Department said work began on 549,000 houses in March,
compared with the median 520,000 forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The U.S. is Taiwan’s second-biggest overseas
market. Global investors bought $1.3 billion more Taiwanese
shares than they sold this month, contributing to the local
dollar’s 1.4 percent advance during the period.  “The  Taiwan dollar  and other Asian currencies were
supported by the improved U.S. data,” said Eric Hsing, a debt
trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Movements of the
currency have been largely decided by foreign fund flows
recently.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to NT$29.025
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. That was the biggest one-day gain
since April 7.  The government reported today that export orders gained
13.4 percent in March from a year ago, better than the 4.7
percent gain forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Orders rose 5.3 percent in February.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 1
percent note due January 2016, the most-active government
security, was 1.072 percent, from 1.073 percent yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
