Korea Gas Corp. (036460)  is studying plans
to build a liquified natural gas port on the northern coast of
Canadaâ€™s Northwest Territory to take gas from the region and
ship it to Asia, the Globe and Mail reported, citing Chad Yang,
general manager of Kogas Canada Ltd.   The company last February agreed to a joint venture with
Encana Corp. to invest $1.1 billion in British Columbia gas
