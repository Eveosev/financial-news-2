The following is the text of the
Electric Power Flash report from the U.S. Department of Energy:  In February 2011, the contiguous  United States  as a whole
experienced temperatures that were near normal.  Accordingly,
the total population-weighted heating degree days for the United
States were just 1.5 percent above the February normal.  Retail sales of electricity increased 0.2 percent from February
2010.  Over the same period, the average U.S. retail price of
electricity increased 3.0 percent.  For the 12-month period
ending February 2011, the average U.S. retail price of
electricity increased 1.6 percent over the previous 12-month
period ending February 2010.  Total electric power generation in the United States decreased
3.0 percent compared to February 2010 (the change in electric
power generation does not necessarily coincide with the change
in retail sales of electricity because utility billing cycles
tend to lag electricity production in many areas).  This was due
to the much colder weather experienced in February 2010.  Over
the same period, coal generation decreased 9.5 percent, while
natural gas generation decreased 2.6 percent and petroleum
liquids generation increased 8.5 percent.  Conventional
hydroelectric generation increased 18.5 percent from the
previous year, mainly due to a stronger than expected snowmelt
in the Northwest region.  All other generation showed the
largest change, increasing by 31.9 percent.  This was largely
due to the addition of several new wind farms, most notably
Streator Cayuga Ridge South in  Illinois .  Total coal stocks decreased 2.1 percent from January 2011.
However, following the winter pattern observed in previous years,
the average number of days of burn for coal plants consuming
bituminous or subbituminous coal as their primary fuel increased
from the previous month.  SOURCE: U.S. Department of Energy
