U.S. Gulf crude premiums narrowed
against West  Texas  Intermediate as Brent oil’s spread against
the U.S. benchmark shrank for the second consecutive day.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery decreased 54 cents to $12.51 a barrel at 1:43 p.m. in
 New York . The differential for the contract nearest to
expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European grade.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed 15 cents to
$15 a barrel at 11:48 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium was
unchanged at $15.75 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend weakened 25 cents to $8.50 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium decreased 30 cents to $9 a barrel. Southern Green
Canyon’s premium lost 95 cents to $7.30 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium gained 25 cents to $10.75 a barrel.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to $3.05 a
barrel. The grade has tracked more closely to its historical
average discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland,
Texas, away from the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
the delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $12.35 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$15.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
