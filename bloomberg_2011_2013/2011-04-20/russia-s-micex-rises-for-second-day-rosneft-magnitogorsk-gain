Russian stocks rose to the highest
level in a week, led by commodity producers, as oil, the
country’s chief export, gained.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  climbed 1.6 percent to 1,783.38 by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow. The dollar-denominated RTS Index rose 2.2
percent to 2,030.97.  Oil for June delivery rallied 1.9 percent to $110.18 a
barrel as signs of an improving economy in the U.S., including a
March housing report released by the Commerce Department
yesterday, kindled speculation demand for fuel may increase.
Work began on 549,000 houses at an annual pace, up 7.2 percent
from the prior month, exceeding the 520,000 median forecast of
economists, the report showed.  OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil unit of Russia’s gas export
monopoly, jumped 4.7 percent, the biggest gain on the Micex
today, to 145.05 rubles. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil
company, increased 1.8 percent to 253.94 rubles. The company
said late yesterday it will buy back as much as $200 million of
its shares in the “coming months.”  OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel added 1.7 percent to 28.642
rubles, its highest closing level in a week, after the
steelmaker said it may pay 33 kopeks a share in dividends for
2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
