German insurers would be able to
handle a restructuring of  Greece ’s debt as the industry’s total
capital investment in the country was 4.9 billion euros ($7.1
billion) as of Sept. 30,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing figures
from  Germany ’s finance ministry.  That amount equals 0.3 percent of all of the companies’
capital investment, according to the report. Nearly the entire
amount is made up of loans to the government, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
