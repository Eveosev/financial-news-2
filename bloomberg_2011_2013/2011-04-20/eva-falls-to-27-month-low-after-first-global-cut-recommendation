Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. (TEVA) , the world’s biggest maker of generic drugs, dropped to the
lowest level in more than two years after First Global (UK) Ltd.
cut its recommendation.  The shares retreated 1.9 percent to 168.3 shekels at the
2:45 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , the lowest since February 2009.  First Global examined the recently released results of the
first of the company’s two Phase III drug trials, dubbed
Allegro, on Laquinimod, its new oral multiple sclerosis drug.
The drug cut relapses by 23 percent, less than older injected
treatments, compared with a placebo in a study of 1,106
patients. First Global lowered its recommendation on Teva to
“market perform” from “market outperform.”  Laquinimod was expected to reduce relapses by 25 percent to
30 percent, matching older injected drugs from Bayer AG, Merck
KGaA and  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB) , Credit Suisse analysts including Ravi
Mehrotra wrote in a note on April 7. The Teva pill was also
expected to reduce disability by 30 percent to 40 percent,
almost as much as Tysabri, an infused therapy from Biogen and
Elan Corp., according to Mehrotra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
