Iran ’s interior minister Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar said the kidnapping this week of 12 Iranian
engineers in southwestern  Afghanistan  was not politically
motivated and the men will be released within “two days,”
 Press TV  reported.  In a report to the Iranian Parliament’s National Security
and Foreign Policy Committee the interior minister dismissed
claims that the men had been kidnapped by Taliban militants, the
committee’s secretary, Fatemeh Alia, said, according to the
state-run news channel.  The head of the town where the engineers were at work
opposed the men’s construction activities and ordered them to be
seized by locals and taken to a distant location, Alia said.
Negotiations for their release are underway, she said, citing
Mohammad-Najjar.  The engineers, who worked at the site of an Iranian company
in the city of Farah, were attacked on April 18 by unidentified
gunmen, state media then said citing Naqibullah Farahi, an
Afghan provincial government spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
