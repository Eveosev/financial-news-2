BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , a U.K. oil explorer
focused on Cameroon, plunged the most in two years after its
Sapele well off the African country’s coast found less oil than
analysts expected.  BowLeven fell 13 percent to 300 pence in London, the
biggest drop since August 2009.  The company drilled the Sapele-1 sidetrack, which
encountered a total of 23 meters (75 feet) of hydrocarbon-
bearing interval in the Omicron reservoir, the Edinburgh-based
company said today in a statement. It will need more tests to
estimate the deposit’s resource potential.  “The positive is that hydrocarbons have been encountered,
the negative is that the net pay encountered looks to have come
in under expectations,” Phil Corbett, an analyst at Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in an e-mailed report. “The flow
test results will be key.”  BowLeven is drilling Block 5 in Cameroon, which may hold as
much as 1 billion barrels oil equivalent, BowLeven Chief
Executive Officer Kevin Hart forecast last month. The Sapele-1
side track and Sapele-2 wells may hold in excess of 100 million
barrels of recoverable oil, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
