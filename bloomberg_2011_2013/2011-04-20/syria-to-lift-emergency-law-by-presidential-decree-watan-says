Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
will issue a decree today approving the lifting of a state-of-
emergency law, privately run  Al Watan newspaper  reported, citing
an unidentified senior government official.  The emergency law won’t be replaced by a special anti-
terrorism law, according to the Damascus-based  newspaper , which
is close to the regime. An existing general punishment law
applies to terrorism crimes, it said.  Assad will also issue a decree today canceling the supreme
state security court and on the organization of peaceful
protests,  Al Watan  said.  Syria ’s Cabinet yesterday endorsed a draft decree to scrap
the 48-year-old emergency law, the main demand of demonstrators
challenging Assad’s rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
