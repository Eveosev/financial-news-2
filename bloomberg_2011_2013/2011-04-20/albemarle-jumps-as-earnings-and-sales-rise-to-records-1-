Albemarle Corp. (ALB) , the worldâ€™s
biggest maker of refinery catalysts, climbed the most in more
than two years as rising prices for flame retardants helped lift
first-quarter sales and earnings to a record.  Albemarle rose $7.05, or 12 percent, to $64.87 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest gain
since November 2008. The shares have increased 16 percent this
year.  Net income increased 68 percent to $106.6 million, or $1.15
a share, from $63.3 million, or 69 cents, a year earlier,  Baton
Rouge , Louisiana-based Albemarle said yesterday in a statement.
Sales rose 20 percent to $696.5 million. Analysts projected
profit of 96 cents, the average of 11 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Analysts also predicted sales of $636.3 million.  The polymer additives unit, which makes flame retardants
for electronics, contributed most of the earnings surprise,
according to analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets, Jefferies and
Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The company will earn more than $4 a share this year,
exceeding its 2012 earnings forecast a year early, Chief
Executive Officer Mark Rohr said on a conference call with
analysts today. Profit in 2011 is estimated to be $4.08, the
average of 12 analysts in the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
