Barcelona midfielder  Andres Iniesta 
will be able to play in the first game of the Champions League
semifinal against Real Madrid after escaping further penalty for
allegedly getting a yellow card on purpose.  A report from match officials said he deliberately incurred
the booking in the 5-1 opening quarterfinal game against
 Shakhtar Donetsk  on April 6. That earned him a mandatory ban for
the return match, which Barcelona won 1-0.  Barcelona appealed against proposed additional sanctions
from European governing body  UEFA , which said on its website
today that disciplinary proceedings have now been dropped.  “UEFA has announced it will not be suspending the
midfielder,” Barcelona said on its  website . “UEFA have also
announced that he will not face any financial penalty.”  Real  Madrid  hosts the first semifinal game April 27, with
the return match six days later at the Nou Camp Stadium. The
winner will meet Manchester United or Schalke in the final May
28 at London’s Wembley Stadium.  UEFA did fine Spanish club Villarreal and players Nilmar
and Santi Cazorla after the two picked up deliberate yellow
cards in a Europa League quarterfinal match.  Villarreal was fined 60,000 euros ($87,000), with the
players being fined 20,000 euros each,  UEFA said . Villarreal has
three days to appeal.  Nilmar and Cazorla were booked as Villarreal beat FC Twente
5-1 in their quarterfinal game April 7, ruling them out of the
return match a week later. Villarreal advanced to the semifinal,
where it will face Porto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
