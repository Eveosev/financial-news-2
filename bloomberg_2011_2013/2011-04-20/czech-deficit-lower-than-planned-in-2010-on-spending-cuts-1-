The Czech public-finance deficit in
2010 was lower than the target as the government cut spending in
an effort to wipe out the shortfall in five years, Finance
Minister Miroslav Kalousek said.  The gap was 4.71 percent of gross domestic product,
compared with a plan for 5.3 percent, Kalousek told reporter in
 Prague  today after a cabinet meeting. The government plans to
cut the deficit to 3.5 percent next year, 2.9 percent in 2013
and 1.9 percent in 2014, and have balanced public finances in
2016, he said.  Public spending will be capped at 1.154 trillion koruna
($69 billion) next year, 1.177 trillion koruna in 2013 and 1.212
trillion koruna in 2014, Kalousek said, citing a draft medium-
term spending plan the cabinet discussed today.  The spending plan is “an immensely important instrument of
financial discipline,” Kalousek said. “If the economy is doing
better, if we collect more taxes and have higher revenue, this
revenue must not be spent but is used to liquidate the
deficit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
