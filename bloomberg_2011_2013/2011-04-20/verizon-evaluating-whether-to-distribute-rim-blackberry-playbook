Verizon Wireless , the largest U.S.
wireless carrier, said it is still evaluating whether to offer
 Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) ’s BlackBerry Playbook tablet computer to
its customers.  Brenda Raney , a spokeswoman for Verizon, declined to say
when the carrier might make a decision. On March 22, RIM said in
a release that Verizon was one of the carriers expected to offer
the device, along with  AT&T Inc. (T)  and  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)   The PlayBook went on sale yesterday in about 20,000 stores
in Canada and the U.S. including Best Buy Co. and Staples Inc.
outlets. The initial version of the tablet is Wi-Fi only, which
doesn’t offer the potential for carriers to make money selling
contracts for the device.  RIM said in January that Sprint planned to offer a 4G
version of the device this summer. The Waterloo, Ontario-based
company said in February that it would introduce models of the
PlayBook based on LTE, or long-term evolution, and HSPA+
technology used by Verizon and AT&T.  Marisa Conway, a spokeswoman for RIM, did not immediately
return a message seeking comment.  RIM rose $1.24, or 2.3 percent, to $54.46 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock market trading.  Verizon Communications
Inc. (VZ) , which co-owns the wireless company with  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,
climbed 55 cents to $37.79.  To contact the reporters on this story:
