Russia â€™s government will spend a
further 9 billion rubles ($320 million) to support pork and
poultry producers, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said in an
address to legislators.  Domestic producers now satisfy three-quarters of national
meat demand, according to Putin. Russia will import about
300,000 metric tons of poultry in 2011, down from 1.3 million
tons five years ago, after the local industry expanded, he said
today.  Total budget spending for additional support of agriculture
comes to 13 billion rubles this year, the prime minister said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
