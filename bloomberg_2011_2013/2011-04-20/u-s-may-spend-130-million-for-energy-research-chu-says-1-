The U.S.  Energy Department  said it
will provide as much as $130 million for projects in its
 Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy , known as ARPA-E.  The funding is for five categories: producing biofuels as
an alternative to oil, storing thermal energy, finding
alternatives to expensive rare-earth minerals, maintaining
electric grid reliability as renewable sources are added and
reducing costs for solar power, according to a statement.  “ARPA-E is unleashing American innovation to strengthen
America’s global competitiveness and win the clean energy
race,” Energy Secretary Steven Chu said today in a statement.  The agency, created in 2009, backs technologies that are
too risky to lure business investments alone. President  Barack Obama ’s administration has asked Congress to provide ARPA-E with
$650 million for fiscal year 2012.  ARPA-E received $363 million in economic stimulus money,
which has funded 121 projects in 30 states, the Energy
Department said. Six of those projects have drawn $100 million
from private investors, the agency said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
