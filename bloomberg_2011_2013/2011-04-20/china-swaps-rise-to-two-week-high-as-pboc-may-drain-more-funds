China ’s interest-rate swaps climbed
to the highest level in two weeks on speculation the central
bank will drain more funds from the banking system, pushing up
short-term money market rates.  People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor  Hu Xiaolian  said
policy makers have “considerable” room to raise banks’ reserve
requirements, according to a  statement  published on its website
yesterday. The central bank ordered lenders to set aside more
cash as reserves on April 17 for a fourth time this year, with
the move due to take effect April 21.  “Traders speculate more tightening measures will be
introduced to push up short-term money-market rates,” said Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial Bank Co. in  Shanghai . “But
space for a further increase in swap rates is limited because
maturing bills and capital inflows are helping add cash to the
financial system.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose three basis
points to 3.42 percent as of 10:06 a.m. in Shanghai, the highest
level since April 6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, gained six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 3.02 percent, according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.
It touched 3.04 percent, the highest level since Feb. 28.  A total of 191 billion yuan ($29.3 billion) of central bank
bills and  repurchase agreements  will be redeemed this week,
according to Liu Junyu, a Shenzhen-based bond analyst at China
Merchants Bank Co. The monetary authority sold 55 billion yuan
of one-year bills and 32 billion yuan of 28-day repurchase
agreements yesterday.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due March
2021 was unchanged at 3.92 percent, according to the Interbank
Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
