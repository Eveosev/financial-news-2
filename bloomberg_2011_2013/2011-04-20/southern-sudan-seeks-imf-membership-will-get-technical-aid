Southern Sudan , which is scheduled
to become independent in July, is seeking membership in the
 International Monetary Fund , the lender said.  The Washington-based IMF, which currently has 187 member
countries, said in a statement today that it will seek donor
contributions for a  trust fund  that would provide technical
assistance to the country as it seeks to build its economic
institutions.  The trust fund would “total $10.6 million for just under
four years and aims to mobilize quickly, given the urgency of
needs in South Sudan,” the IMF said.  Its aim will be to “enable the design, implementation and
monitoring of sound macroeconomic policies, including by
developing a fiscal framework, establishing the central bank and
its core activities, building statistical capacity and putting
in place the legislative framework required for effective
economic and financial management.”  Almost 99 percent of Southern Sudanese voters chose to
secede from  Sudan  and form an independent country in a January
referendum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
