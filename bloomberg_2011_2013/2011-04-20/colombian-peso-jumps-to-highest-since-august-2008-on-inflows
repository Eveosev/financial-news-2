Colombia’s peso advanced to its
highest level since August 2008 amid rising foreign direct
investment into the oil and mining industries and as companies
repatriated profits from abroad to pay taxes this month.  The peso climbed 0.5 percent to 1,780.27 per  U.S. dollar  at
3:07 p.m. New York time, from 1,788.45 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,776.20, the strongest level since August 2008. The
currency has jumped 5.1 percent so far this month, the best
performance among world currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “Both FDI and portfolio investment flows have been rising
compared to what we had last year,” said  David Aldana , head
analyst at brokerage Ultrabursatiles SA in Bogota. “The peso
has also been helped by companies bringing in dollars to pay
taxes, which is something that will continue into next week.”  Foreign direct investment rose to $3.23 billion in the year
through March, with 86 percent going into oil and mining,
according to trade balance figures from the  central bank . That
compares to $2.17 billion in the first three months of 2010.  Portfolio inflows have risen to $825 million in the year
through March, compared to a net decline of $21 million a year
ago, according to the central bank.  Companies are scheduled to pay taxes in  Colombia  between
April 8 and April 25.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.25
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price declined 0.244 centavo to 113.738 centavos per peso.  Colombian markets are closed April 21-22 for Easter
holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
