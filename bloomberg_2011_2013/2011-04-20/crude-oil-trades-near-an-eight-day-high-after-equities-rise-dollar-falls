Oil rose for a third day in  New
York  as signs of an improving economy in the U.S., the world’s
biggest crude-consuming nation, stoked speculation demand for
fuel may increase.  Futures for June delivery climbed as much as 0.9 percent,
extending yesterday’s 2.9 percent gain, as  Asia ’s equities
benchmark advanced to a six week high after Apple Inc.’s profit
beat projections. Prices also gained after the Energy Department
reported an unexpected drop in U.S. crude supplies.  “We had better-than-expected earnings yesterday for the
technology sector and that supports the idea that demand seems
intact despite concerns over higher commodity prices,” said
Serene Lim, a commodity strategist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore . “The bullish inventory report
overnight will bolster the market today.”  Crude oil for June delivery gained as much as $1.03 to
$112.48 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It was at $111.77 at 3:20 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, the contract climbed $3.17 to $111.45, the
highest since April 8. Prices are up 34 percent the past year.  Brent crude oil for June settlement advanced 38 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $124.23 a barrel. Yesterday, it rose $2.52, or
2.1 percent, to end the session at $123.85 on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange, the highest close since April 11.  Crude Inventories  The European benchmark traded at a premium of $12.40 a
barrel to U.S. futures yesterday. The difference between front-
month contracts in  London  and New York surged to a record $19.54
on Feb. 21. The spread averaged 76 cents last year.  U.S. crude oil supplies fell 2.32 million barrels to 357
million last week, the first drop since February, the Energy
Department said yesterday in a weekly report. Inventories were
forecast to increase by 1.3 million barrels, according to the
median of 13 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.58 million barrels to 208.1
million, the lowest level since the week ended Nov. 12, the
report showed. Stockpiles were forecast to decline by 1.75
million barrels, according to the survey.  The MSCI World Index rose 0.5 percent as of 4:08 p.m. in
 Tokyo , the MSCI Asia Pacific Index jumped 1.3 percent and the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.2 percent. Standard & Poor’s 500
Index futures rose 0.4 percent.  Middle East  Oil has advanced 22 percent in New York this year. Unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa has toppled leaders in Egypt
and Tunisia and spread to  Libya , Algeria, Bahrain,  Iran , Oman,
Syria and Yemen. Libyan crude output, which averaged 1.6 million
barrels a day last year, fell to 390,000 barrels a day in March,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  At least 153 people died across northern  Nigeria  in riots
by supporters of opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari, who lost
the April 16 presidential vote in  Africa ’s top oil-producing
country, a civil rights group said yesterday. Attacks by armed
groups cut more than 28 percent of the country’s output between
2006 and 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
