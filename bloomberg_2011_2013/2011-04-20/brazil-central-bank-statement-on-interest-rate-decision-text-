Following is a translation of the
statement by  Brazil ’s central bank on its interest rate decision
today.  “Following the process of adjustment of monetary
conditions, the Copom decided to raise the Selic rate to 12
percent a year, without a bias, with five votes in favor, and
two votes in favor of raising the rate 0.5 percentage point.  Taking into account the balance of inflation risks, the
still uncertain rhythm of the moderation of domestic activity,
as well as the complexity of the international environment, the
committee understands that, at the moment, the implementation of
adjustment in monetary conditions for a sufficiently long period
is the most adequate strategy to guarantee the convergence of
inflation to the target in 2012.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
