Lawmakers in Niger elected former
Prime Minister Hama Amadou as the speaker of parliament,  la Voix
du Sahel  reported, citing a vote late yesterday.  Amadou was backed by 103 of the 104 lawmakers present in
parliament in the capital, Niamey, the state-owned broadcaster
said. In January, Amadou came third in the first round of
presidential elections before urging his supporters to back
Mahamadou Issoufou, the eventual winner of the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
