Sephaku Holdings Ltd. (SEP)  said its
cement unit plans a 3,000 metric ton per day clinker and cement
production facility in  South Africa ’s Limpopo province.  Construction of the plant is expected to begin in 2013,
Sephaku Cement Managing Director Pieter Fourie said in a
statement to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange today. Production
should follow two years later, helping to reverse shrinking
clinker capacity for next five to eight years, he said.  Sephaku Cement is 64 percent-owned by Dangote Cement
Industries Plc, Africa’s biggest cement maker.  The company did not say how much it would spend on the
plant in the Limpopo town of Dwaalboom, about 300 kilometers
north (186 miles) of Johannesburg. Dangote Cement, which is
listed in  Nigeria , said April 13 that it would invest $3.9
billion constructing plants in South Africa, Ethiopia, Cameroon,
the Republic of Congo and Gabon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
