Formula One head  Bernie Ecclestone 
said the autoracing body hasn’t been approached by  News Corp. (NWSA)  or
Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim  about a takeover.  CVC Capital Partners Ltd., the majority owner of the sports
group, isn’t the “slightest bit” interested in selling,
Ecclestone said today in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
