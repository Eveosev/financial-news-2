Kevin Garnett  hit a shot with 13
seconds remaining and then stole a pass as the Boston Celtics
defeated the New York Knicks 96-93 to take a 2-0 lead in their
National Basketball Association playoff series.  Carmelo Anthony had 42 points and 17 rebounds for the
Knicks in the game tonight at TD Garden in Boston.  The Knicks played without point guard  Chauncey Billups , who
has a strained left knee. It was unclear whether Billups would
be able to return for Game 3, which is set for April 22 at New
