Biofuels may account for 27 percent
of world transportation fuel by 2050, from 2 percent currently,
the  International Energy Agency  said today in a report.  Biofuel use may rise to 750 million tons of oil equivalent
from 55 million, the Paris-based IEA said. This would require
investment of as much as $13 trillion, the organization said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
