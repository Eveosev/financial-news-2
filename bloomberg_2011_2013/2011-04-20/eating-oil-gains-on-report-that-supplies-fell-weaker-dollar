Heating oil widened gains after the
Energy Department reported that distillate supplies slipped last
week to the lowest level in a year and demand increased.  Futures rose as much as 1.8 percent as stockpiles of
distillates, including heating oil and diesel, dropped 2.5
million barrels to 148.3 million in the week ended April 15.
Consumption of the fuels rose 8.2 percent.  “The report was bullish right across the board, everything
was a decline and it was a big decline,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in  New York . “It looks like distillate is starting to catch up
versus gasoline.”  Heating oil for May delivery rose 5.42 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $3.2127 a gallon at 11:41 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched a high $3.2163 after the
report’s 10:30 a.m. release in  Washington .  Prices were up before the report as equities gained and the
dollar weakened. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 1.4
percent as  Intel Corp . forecast higher earnings. The dollar sank
1.3 percent against the euro and touched $1.4548, a 15-month
low. A weaker dollar increases the investment appeal of dollar-
denominated commodities.  “The dollar is a major factor for commodities today,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in
 Chicago .  Distillate demand, measured by deliveries to wholesalers,
rose to 4.11 million barrels a day, the most in six weeks. The
four-week average is 6.2 percent above a year earlier, according
to the department.  Gasoline Stockpiles  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.58 million barrels to 208.1
million, a five-month low. Supplies have shed 33 million
barrels, or 14 percent, since Feb. 11, when they were the
highest in almost 21 years.  Gasoline demand fell 1.3 percent to an average 9.06 million
barrels a day, the third decline in four weeks. On a four-week
average, fuel consumption was 1.8 percent below a year earlier.  Gasoline for May delivery advanced 3.65 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $3.2696 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular retail gasoline rose 0.2 cent to $3.837 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest price
since Sept. 16, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
