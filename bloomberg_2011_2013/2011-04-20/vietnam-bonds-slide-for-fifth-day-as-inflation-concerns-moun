Vietnam ’s five-year bonds dropped
for a fifth day, the longest losing streak in five months, as
inflation concerns and the prospect of higher  interest rates 
sapped demand for fixed-income assets. The dong weakened.  The yield on the debt rose 9.5 basis points to a one-year
high of 12.32 percent, according to a daily fixing price from
banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  “There are no signs that inflation will decline and
investors are concerned that the government will further tighten
monetary policy,” said Luu Hai Yen, an analyst at Thang Long
Securities Joint-Stock Co. “The central bank still has room to
raise interest rates to 14 percent.”  Vietnam’s consumer price index is forecast to rise 1.6
percent to 1.8 percent in April from March, online newswire Phap
Luat Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh reported, citing a Ministry of
Finance projection. Yen said the actual figure may be even
higher as gains of more than 3 percent are estimated this month
for Hanoi and  Ho Chi Minh City . Consumer prices increased 2.2
percent in March from February, the most since May 2008, and
jumped 13.9 percent from a year earlier, official figures show.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam raised interest rates on April 1
for the second time in less than a month to help rein in
inflation. The refinancing rate was increased to 13 percent from
12 percent, while the seven-day repurchase rate was boosted to
13 percent from 12 percent.  The dong fell 0.03 percent to 20,930 per dollar as of 2:58
p.m. in Hanoi, from 20,923 yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  The State Bank of Vietnam fixed the  reference rate  at
20,728, compared with 20,733 yesterday, its website showed. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
that rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editor:  James Regan   To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
