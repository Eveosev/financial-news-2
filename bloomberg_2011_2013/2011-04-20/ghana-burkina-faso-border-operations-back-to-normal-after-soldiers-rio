Trade between  Ghana  and  Burkina
Faso  is “returning to normal” following the rioting by Burkinabe
soldiers that closed the border between the two nations, said
Mark Woyongo,  Ghana ’s Upper East regional minister.  “Burkinabe officials at the border told us the government
has begun paying the soldiers,” Woyongo said by phone. “The
border is very calm today.”  The frontier at the northern Ghanaian town of Paga and the
nearby Burkinabe community of Po was shuttered for 24 hours
between April 16 and April 17 after a mutiny by soldiers in
several towns, including Po. “Some Ghanaians were robbed of
their money and mobile phones,” Woyongo said.  In Ouagadougou, the capital, soldiers looted shops and set
buildings on fire during several days of protests that started
when members of the country’s presidential guard mutinied on
April 15. President Blaise Compaore dissolved his government and
dismissed the chiefs of staff of the army, air force and police
in a bid to quell the protests.  Burkina Faso, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s biggest cotton producer,
is a landlocked nation that relies on ports in neighboring Ghana
and  Ivory Coast  for imports and exports of key goods. The
country has been in turmoil since student demonstrations in
February against the death of a pupil in police custody. On
March 22, soldiers protested a court decision sentencing
officers to prison.  Shops in the city began to reopen yesterday and Honore
Nabere, the newly appointed army chief of staff, said on state-
owned Radio Television du Burkina that he would resolve the
crisis “by discussion.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
