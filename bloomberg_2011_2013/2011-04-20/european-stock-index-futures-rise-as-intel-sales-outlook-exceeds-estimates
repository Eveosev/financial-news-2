European stocks rose the most in a
month after results from  Intel Corp. (INTC)  to PSA Peugeot Citroen and
 L’Oreal SA (OR)  spurred investor optimism in the economic recovery.  ASML Holding NV (ASML) ,  Europe ’s biggest chip-equipment maker,
gained 5.3 percent as Intel posted first-quarter profit that
beat forecasts and said it will generate $12.8 billion of
revenue in the current period. Peugeot and L’Oreal rose at least
3 percent as sales beat the average analyst estimate at Europe’s
second-biggest carmaker and the world’s largest cosmetics maker.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rallied 1.7 percent to 279.06 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The benchmark gauge has climbed
6.4 percent from this year’s low on March 16 as investors
speculated that the economic recovery will withstand the effects
of  Japan ’s worst earthquake on record and popular revolts in the
Middle East and north  Africa .  “We continue to believe that the general trend of the
stock market will be higher,” said Kully Samra, who manages
U.K.-based clients for Charles Schwab Corp., which has $1.5
trillion in assets. “European stocks appear to be attractively
valued.”  Of the 30 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have reported
earnings since April 11, 20 have beaten estimates for per-share
profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge is
trading at 11.2 times the estimated earnings of its companies,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an
average of 12.3 during the past five years, the data show.  National benchmark indexes climbed in every western
European market except  Greece  and Luxembourg. The U.K.’s FTSE
100 Index gained 2.1 percent, Germany’s DAX Index rallied 3
percent and France’s CAC 40 Index rose 2.5 percent.  ASML, Schneider Electric  ASML surged 5.3 percent to 28.17 euros. Intel projected
revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million, for the
second quarter. That compared with the $11.9 billion average of
analysts’ projections compiled by Bloomberg.  Telecity Group Plc (TCY)  rose 1.5 percent to 523 pence after
 VMware Inc. (VMW) , the biggest maker of programs that let computers
run multiple operating systems, reported first-quarter profit
that topped analysts’ estimates as it benefited from a foray
into storage and desktop software.  Along with technology companies, carmakers were among the
19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600 posting the biggest gains.  Peugeot, Europe’s second-biggest carmaker, climbed 4.7
percent to 28.45 euros as revenue in the first quarter of 15.4
billion euros ($22.4 billion) beat the average analyst estimate
of 14.9 billion euros in a Bloomberg survey.  Fiat, L’Oreal, Bic  Fiat SpA (F)  jumped 4.6 percent to 6.58 euros as the owner of
the Ferrari marque posted first-quarter earnings before
interest, taxes and one-off items of 251 million euros. That
beat the 241 million-euro average estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  L’Oreal gained 3.2 percent to 85.88 euros after the
cosmetics maker reported first-quarter sales growth that beat
analysts’ estimates as customers bought more Maybelline makeup
and Ralph Lauren fragrances.  Bic SA surged 6.9 percent to 64.36 euros. The world’s
biggest maker of disposable pens reported an increase in first-
quarter net income to 53.9 million euros from 35.4 million euros
a year earlier.  HSBC, Temenos Group  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  climbed 1.8 percent to 651.8 pence as
Morgan Stanley advised buying the shares of Europe’s largest
bank. HSBC was upgraded to “overweight” from “equal weight”
at Morgan Stanley.  “We believe that performance could improve meaningfully
from 2010, driven by  Asia , cost control, lower impairments and
by leveraging its balance sheet and funding advantage to
increase loan growth and gain share,” London-based analyst
Steven Hayne wrote in a report dated yesterday.  Temenos Group AG (TEMN)  sank 5.9 percent to 30.10 francs, its
biggest decline in two months, as the banking software maker
reported a first-quarter loss of $10.9 million and executives
sold shares.  Greek banks fell as a German official said the
Mediterranean nation will probably have to restructure its debt.
 National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  slid 4.2 percent to 5.24 euros. EFG
Eurobank Ergasias plunged 8.5 percent to 3.36 euros and  Alpha
Bank AE (ALPHA)  tumbled 8.4 percent to 3.58 euros.  “I fear that Greece can’t get out of this situation
without some kind of restructuring,” Lars Feld, a member of
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s council of economic advisers,
told Deutschlandfunk radio today. That could involve “the
buyback of bonds through a European institution,” Feld said,
without elaborating.  Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl (PMI)  tumbled 8.6 percent to 2.31
euros as Italy’s oldest cooperative bank said it plans to raise
as much as 1.2 billion euros by selling new shares.  Bank of England  policy makers voted 6-3 to keep  interest
rates  on hold this month as the majority said that data on the
economy over the previous month had “probably been to the
downside.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
