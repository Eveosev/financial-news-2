Germany ’s antitrust regulator
cleared  Novell Inc. (NOVL) ’s sale of 882 software patents to a group
including Microsoft Inc., Oracle Inc.,  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and EMC Corp.  The Bonn-based Federal Cartel Office cleared the deal after
the companies agreed to accommodate antitrust concerns raised by
the German regulator and the  U.S. Department of Justice , the
office said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  The patent sale was linked to the acquisition of Novell by
Attachmate Corp. The sales agreement was cleared only after the
companies retracted their original plan and refiled it with new
terms, according to the statement.  Under the revised terms Microsoft will sell Seattle-based
Attachmate its share in the patents. EMC agreed not to acquire
Novell patents and patent applications related to virtualization
software.  Regulators in Germany and the U.S. had concerns because the
original deal could have threatened smaller competitors, the
office said. Changes in the sale terms were necessary to protect
competition and innovation in the open-source software
community, the  Justice Department  said it a  separate statement .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
