Adrian Faure,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s new
global head of emerging-markets equities, comments by phone from
Hong Kong on developing nations.  “The market cap over GDP ratio in those regions is still
very, very low compared to the developed markets. It’s quite
clear we’ve seen over the last several years, we will continue
to see in many years to come, that market cap is going to
continue to grow rapidly as we see further privatizations coming
out of  China , Russia, Brazil,  South Africa  and  India ; the major
emerging market economies."  On Citigroup’s strategy:  ‘‘There’s no question we are going to be investing further.
Our goal is we will be a top 3 player in each of those markets
that we choose to invest in.  "There are opportunities set in the big economies and the
big markets. The strategy we are going to have is to focus on
those. We are not going to be chasing after the smaller
opportunities at this stage, we need to have a dominant position
in the major markets. Over time, we will cherry pick one of the
smaller markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
