Saxo Bank A/S owners are close to
selling a 33 percent stake to a U.S. private equity fund for 5
billion kroner ($960 million), newspaper Borsen reported today
without saying how it got the information.  General Atlantic LLC will sell its 22 percent stake,
Espirito Santo Financial Group will sell its 9.9 percent stake,
while some employees will also sell some minor stakes,
Copenhagen-based Borsen said. General Atlantic hired JPMorgan
Chase Co. and SEB to sell their share, Borsen said.   Saxo founders Kim Fournais and Lars Seier are not selling
their stakes because they think the price isnâ€™t high enough,
Borsen said.        Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
