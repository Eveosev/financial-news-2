Malaysia ’s ringgit reached the
strongest level in 13 years on speculation accelerating
inflation will prompt policy makers to raise interest rates or
tolerate currency appreciation.  The currency rebounded from a four-week low before a
government report today that may show consumer prices rose last
month at the fastest pace in almost two years, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. Singapore and China, Malaysia’s two
largest export markets, grew faster than economists had
predicted in the first quarter, according to data last week.
 Government bonds  declined.  “I’m confident of the ringgit upside,” said Akira Banno,
a treasury adviser at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. in Kuala
Lumpur. “While the central bank could adopt a wait-and-see
approach, we should see the currency strengthening to counter
inflation.”  The ringgit gained 0.3 percent to 3.0155 per dollar as of
4:13 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.0140, the highest level since October
1997. It may reach 3 per dollar by the end of the month, Banno
said.  Inflation accelerated 3.1 percent in March from a year
earlier, the fastest since April 2009, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 16 economists before a report
due at 5 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur.  Bank Negara Malaysia  next meets to review its benchmark
interest rate on May 5. It has kept its overnight rate at 2.75
percent since July, after raising it three times earlier in
2010. The Bank of  Thailand  raised its benchmark rate by a
quarter percentage point today, the third increase this year.  Bonds Drop  China ’s economy grew 9.7 percent in the first quarter from
a year earlier, more than the 9.4 percent economists surveyed by
Bloomberg had forecast. Singapore’s economy expanded at an
annualized pace of 23.5 percent from the quarter before, more
than double what economists had expected.  Five-year notes dropped for a second day, pushing yields to
a one-week high on concern faster inflation will erode the
appeal of debt’s fixed payments.  The yield on the 4.262 percent note due September 2016
climbed 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.58
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The price dropped 0.08, or
80 sen per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 103.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
