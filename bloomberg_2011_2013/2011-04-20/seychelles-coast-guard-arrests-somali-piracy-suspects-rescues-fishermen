The Seychelles Coast Guard rescued
four Seychellois fishermen and arrested seven Somalis accused of
seizing a fishing vessel, said a spokesman for the president of
the island nation in the  Indian Ocean .  One of the suspected pirates died of injuries sustained in
the operation, which took place about 150 nautical miles (278
kilometers) northeast of Mahe Island, Srdjana Janosevik,
spokesman for President James Michel, said in an e-mailed
statement from the capital, Victoria, today. One fisherman and
two piracy suspects were injured and are being treated at
Seychelles Hospital in the city.  The operation was conducted late yesterday on Michelâ€™s
orders, Janosevik said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
