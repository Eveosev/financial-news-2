U.S. Representative Tim Walz
estimates at the beginning of each new House term how much money
he thinks he’ll need to win re-election the following year and
when he plans to raise it.  This year, after a barrage of ads from outside groups
almost cost him his seat last November, the Minnesota Democrat
accelerated his fundraising. He raised $207,373 during the first
three months of 2011, a 32 percent increase from what he took in
during the same period two years earlier, Federal Election
Commission records show.  Some Democratic lawmakers such as Walz, who is in his third
term, have increased early fundraising to protect against
advertising attacks by Republican-leaning independent groups
that didn’t exist at the beginning of the 2010 election cycle.  “We want to have the resources to get our message out,”
said Walz, 47. “I would rest a little easier if the hay was in
the barn” well before next year’s election, he said.  Republican-leaning groups such as American Crossroads and
related Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, both founded by
former Bush White House aide  Karl Rove , spent $184 million on
the 2010 elections, about $100 million more than Democratic
organizations, according to the Campaign Finance Institute, a
Washington-based research group.  House Majority  The spending helped Republicans win 63 House seats and a
majority in the chamber. It also helped erode support for
Democratic House incumbents such as Walz and Maurice Hinchey of
 New York .  Neither was among those rated politically vulnerable a
month before Election Day, according to the three Washington-
based publications that tracked the 2010 congressional races --
the  Cook Political Report , the Rothenberg Political Report and
Congressional Quarterly. Each ended up in tight races, though.
And both are among those Democrats taking steps earlier than in
the past to fortify their political position in the 2012
election.  Walz polled 49 percent of November’s vote to win a four-
candidate race in which Republican leaning groups spent $410,832
on ads opposing him. Two years earlier, he was re-elected with
63 percent.  The ad attack on him continued this year. Crossroads GPS in
February paid for spots criticizing Walz’s vote against
Republican budget proposals.  Tax-Cut Issue  Crossroads GPS also ran radio ads in Hinchey’s district in
December, shortly after he had won his 10th term, urging him to
support extending Bush-era tax cuts. He opposed the measure,
which passed.  American Crossroads  spent $533,584 in the 2010 campaign
against Hinchey, who won with 53 percent of the vote after
receiving 66 percent in 2008.  Preparing for another battle in 2012, he took in $55,573 in
the first quarter of the year, a 40 percent increase from his
total for the comparable period two years ago. “I’m hoping
we’ll be able to raise more,” Hinchey said.  While Republicans will push to expand their House majority
by going after Democrats such as Walz and Hinchey who survived
tough races in 2010, Democrats have set their sights on
potentially vulnerable Republican freshmen at it tries to win
back a majority in the chamber.  Republican Fundraising  To try to blunt this effort, some first-term Republicans
are outpacing their 2009 fundraising. Paul Lindsay, a spokesman
for the  National Republican Congressional Committee , said strong
early fundraising may deter some Democrats from challenging the
incumbents.  “These reports go a long way in determining their
opposition,” Lindsay said.  Republican Representative Allen West, who defeated Democrat
Ron Klein in a Florida district, raised $456,873 during the
first three months of 2011, more than 10 times the $42,970 he
took in during the same period two years ago. He had $242,614 in
the bank compared with $52,504 in 2009.  “I think I’ll be able to do all right,” West said. “If
you do what’s right for the American people, they’ll want you to
come back here.”  Republican Representative David McKinley of  West Virginia ,
who won an open seat that had been held by a Democrat, took in
$539,736 and had $500,557 in the bank as of March 31. Two years
ago, he wasn’t running yet.
He paid himself back $85,000 that he lent to his 2010 campaign.
A member of the  House Energy and Commerce Committee , McKinley
received $10,000 from the political action committee of
Allegheny Energy Inc., owned by Akron, Ohio-based First Energy
Corp., and $8,000 from Irving, Texas-based  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s
PAC.  Party Figures  Other fundraising figures for 2011’s first quarter showed
that the parties’ House and Senate political committees took in
comparable amounts.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said it
raised $19.6 million during the year’s first three months, more
than in any first quarter in a non-election year. The  National
Republican Congressional Committee  said it raised $18.1 million,
more than double its haul during the same period two years
earlier.  The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said it raised
$11.6 million, while the  National Republican Senatorial
Committee  said it brought in $11.2 million.  Democrats control the Senate 53-47. DSCC Executive Director
Guy Cecil said the committee expected to have enough money “to
not only protect our majority next year, but also play offense
in 2012.”  Rob Jesmer, the NRSC executive director, said the
committee’s goal was “to ensure that not a single Republican
candidate loses on Election Day because of a lack of financial
resources.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
