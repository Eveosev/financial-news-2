Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  issued sales and profit forecasts that
reflected demand from companies eager to upgrade computer
systems left fallow during the recession.  IBM, the largest computer-services provider, boosted its
full-year profit forecast, while Intel, the top chipmaker,
forecast second-quarter sales higher than analysts predicted.
 VMware Inc. (VMW) , EMC Corp. and  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR) , three other
business-technology providers, also met or topped analysts’
projections.  The spate of results suggests that after the recession
ended in 2009 a rebound in demand may be gathering steam.
Companies are outfitting data centers capable of delivering
storage, software and other computing tasks over the Internet.
The  global market  for such cloud-related services may more than
double to $148.8 billion in 2014 from $58.6 billion in 2009,
according to researcher Gartner Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  “The product replacement cycle is finally occurring after
the downturn of 2008,” said  Michael Yoshikami , chief investment
strategist for YCMNet Advisors in Walnut Creek, California.
“The earnings in all of these companies reflect the fact that
businesses are spending again.”  Companies curtailed computer and software spending during
the recession, which stretched from December 2007 to June 2009.
The belt-tightening crimped sales at Intel, Microsoft Corp. and
other technology bellwethers and sent the  Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) 
to a more than six-year low in March 2009.  Intel’s Forecast  Intel’s current-quarter revenue will be $12.8 billion, plus
or minus $500 million, the company said yesterday. That compares
with $11.9 billion, the average of analysts’ projections
compiled by Bloomberg. IBM’s operating earnings will be at least
$13.15 a share this year, higher than a previous projection of
at least $13 and the $13.08 average estimate of analysts.  Intel, based in  Santa Clara ,  California , is benefiting as
mobile devices including Apple Inc.’s iPad drive demand for
online services provided by Intel-powered servers.  First-quarter net income rose 29 percent to $3.16 billion,
or 56 cents a share, from $2.44 billion, or 43 cents, a year
earlier, Intel said. Analysts had estimated profit of 46 cents.
Sales increased 25 percent to $12.8 billion, compared with an
average prediction of $11.6 billion.  Shares Rise  Intel rose $1.55, or 7.8 percent, to $21.41 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. IBM fell 65 cents to
$164.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  IBM’s sales last quarter climbed 7.7 percent to $24.6
billion, topping projections, as software, hardware and services
revenue jumped. Equipment sales climbed for the fifth straight
quarter as customers continued to upgrade after IBM released its
Power7 server-computer system and a new mainframe last year.  VMware, the biggest maker of programs that let computers
run multiple operating systems, reported profit excluding
certain costs of 48 cents a share. That exceeded the 42-cent
average of projections compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 33
percent to $843.7 million, the  Palo Alto , California-based
company said. Analysts on average estimated $814.5 million.  Customers are snapping up VMware products that help make
their servers -- computers used to run websites and networks --
into multitasking machines that can operate several different
applications. Its gains also reflect an expansion into new
businesses, including storage and desktop software.  VMware, EMC, Juniper  “They released 18 new products last year, and here we are
almost six months later,” Robert Breza, an analyst at  RBC
Capital Markets  in  Minneapolis , said in an interview. “You’re
starting to see the new products penetrate the customer base.”  EMC, the world’s biggest maker of storage computers and the
majority owner of VMware, posted per-share profit, excluding
some costs, of 31 cents, meeting analysts’ average estimate.
Sales jumped 18 percent to $4.61 billion, topping estimates, as
companies upgrade their storage systems.  EMC, based in Hopkinton,  Massachusetts , climbed $1.24 to
$27.96. VMware rose $11.93, or 14 percent, to $97.90. VMware
shares had fallen 3.3 percent this year before today.  Technology stocks rallied as the reports spurred optimism
for other companies’ earnings prospects.  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) 
climbed $11.55, or 8.9 percent, to $142.08. The Nasdaq Composite
Index posted its biggest gain since October, rising 2.1 percent.  Juniper, the No. 2 maker of Internet-networking equipment,
reported first-quarter profit that matched analysts’ estimates.
The results were buoyed as Internet and telecommunications
service providers purchase gear to handle the flood of data on
smartphones and computers running bandwidth-hungry videos.  Juniper rose 79 cents to $39.26. The shares of the
Sunnyvale, California-based company have climbed 6.3 percent
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
