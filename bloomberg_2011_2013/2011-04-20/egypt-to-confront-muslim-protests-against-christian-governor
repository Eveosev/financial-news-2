Egypt’s cabinet asked the interior
minister to “confront acts that violate the law” in the
southern province of Qena, where protesters, some blocking a
railway line, are demanding the resignation of a Christian
governor.  In a faxed statement, the cabinet said it can’t stay
“silent” about events that “undermine public security” and
obstruct public services. Blocking the railroad is
“unacceptable” and the government will “take all measures”
to end the protests, which cost the country 1 million Egyptian
pounds (about $168,000) in losses a day, the state-run Middle
East  News Agency  said, citing Ahmed El Simman, media counselor
to the prime minister.  In the latest sign of sectarian tensions, demonstrations
have been staged in Qena since last week against the recent
appointment of a Christian, Emad Mikhail, as governor.  “A non-Muslim should not rule over Muslims,” Mohammed
Hamza, a 29-year-old who has been participating in the
demonstrations, said in a telephone interview from Qena. “This
guy could be shot at if he shows up here.”  Some Christians also took part in the protests against
Mikhail’s appointment because they were unhappy with the
policies of Mikhail’s predecessor, also a Christian, Hamza said.  Protesters have said they object to Mikhail’s appointment
because he is a former senior police officer and they want a
civilian governor.  Christians make up an estimated 10 percent of  Egypt ’s
population. Recent protests contrast a generally peaceful
coexistence between Christians and the Muslim majority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
