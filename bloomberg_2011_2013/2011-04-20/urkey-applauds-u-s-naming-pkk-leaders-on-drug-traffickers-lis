Turkey  applauded a decision by U.S.
authorities to freeze the assets of five members of the
Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement today.  The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Cemil
Bayrak, Duran Kalkan, Remzi Kartal, Sabri Ok and Adem Uzun
“specially designated narcotics traffickers,” leading to a
freeze of their assets in the U.S. and making it illegal for
Americans to engage in business with them,  the statement said .  The five men are members of the leadership team of the PKK,
the Foreign Ministry said. The PKK is a Kurdish separatist
organization that has been fighting the Turkish state since 1984
and is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S.
and European Union.  Turkey expects other countries to follow suit and “carry
through on their obligations” with regard to the fight against
terrorism, the statement said. The men are still allowed
residence and free travel in other countries, it said, without
naming the countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
