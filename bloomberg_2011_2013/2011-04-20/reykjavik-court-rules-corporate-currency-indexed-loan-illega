Reykjavik’s District Court  ruled
that a corporate finance agreement linked to the value of
foreign currencies was illegal.  The court issued its verdict yesterday after reviewing an
agreement between an Icelandic contractor and Islandsbanki hf,
which is controlled by the resolution committee of failed lender
Glitnir Bank hf.  After the collapse of Iceland’s economy in October 2008,
the  central bank  estimated that about 70 percent of Icelandic
company debt was foreign denominated, amounting to about 3.2
trillion kronur ($28 billion) in mid-2009, the bank said in a
financial stability  report  on June 2.  The court refuted an argument that the accord had been a
lease agreement and not a loan, according to  the ruling  posted
on the court’s website.  According to rulings by Iceland’s Supreme Court “it’s
clear that the agreement in question entailed a commitment in
Icelandic kronur,” the local court said. “It’s a loan
agreement in Icelandic kronur indexed to the value of foreign
currencies,” which “is banned,” the court said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
