U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk
said there’s “zero” possibility that three pending free-trade
agreements will be bundled into a single bill. Republicans in
Congress want to consider all three at the same time.  Kirk said his office is discussing with lawmakers when to
send the implementing legislation for accords with  South Korea ,
 Colombia  and Panama. The deals won’t be sent as a package
because no legal precedent exists and combining them into one
measure would increase the risk for rejection on procedural
grounds, he said.  “Bringing them together is highly unlikely, I’d say it’s
zero they’d be in one bill,” Kirk said today at a breakfast
forum in Washington. “What we’re talking with Congress about is
more staging and timing.”  Free-trade agreements with South Korea and Panama are ready
for consideration by lawmakers, Kirk has said. Colombia is
taking steps to boost protections for unions before its accord
is approved.  Senator  Mitch McConnell  of Kentucky led 43 Republicans last
month in vowing to block action on President Barack Obama’s
nominees for Commerce secretary and trade jobs until Congress
gets all three agreements. Presidential nominations for
executive and judicial posts require Senate confirmation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
