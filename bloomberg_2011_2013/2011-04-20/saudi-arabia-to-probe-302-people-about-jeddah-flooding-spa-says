Saudi Arabia  plans to investigate
302 people and 30 companies that may be held accountable for
damage caused by heavy flooding in Jeddah two years ago, the
 Saudi Press Agency  reported, citing the Ministry of Interior.  King Abdullah  last May ordered people implicated in the
flood disaster to be brought before the General Investigation
and Prosecution Authority.  More than 120 people died in heavy flooding in December
2009 that displaced more than 22,000 and destroyed 8,092 homes
and 7,143 cars in and around the western city of Jeddah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
