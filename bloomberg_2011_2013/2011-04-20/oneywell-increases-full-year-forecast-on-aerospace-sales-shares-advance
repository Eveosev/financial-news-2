Honeywell International Inc. (HON) 
boosted its 2011 profit forecast after quarterly earnings
climbed on higher margins at the unit that licenses technology
to oil refineries.  Profit excluding some items will be as much as $3.95 a
share, up from a March forecast of $3.60 to $3.80, according to
a statement today from Honeywell, whose products range from home
thermostats to aircraft parts. Sales will increase as much as
9.7 percent, the  Morris Township , New Jersey-based company said.  First-quarter earnings exceeded analysts’ estimates.
Revenue climbed 19 percent at the  specialty materials  division,
which makes refrigerants and licenses refining technology. The
division’s segment profit margins were 21 percent, compared with
about 15 percent in the previous quarter.  “The standout, of course, is specialty materials, it’s a
big contributor to the beat,” Ajay Kejriwal, an analyst with
FBR Capital Markets in  New York . “Huge margins in specialty
materials.”  Honeywell gained $1.31, or 2.2 percent, to $60.05 at 5:50
p.m. after the close of the New York Stock Exchange. The shares
closed today at $58.74, representing a 10 percent increase this
year.  First-quarter net income climbed 44 percent to $705
million, or 88 cents a share, from $489 million, or 63 cents, a
year earlier. Analysts, on average, estimated profit of 82
cents, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Aerospace revenue increased 7.6 percent after commercial
planemakers increased spending on parts. Sales at the  controls 
division, the company’s largest, climbed 17 percent, helped by
demand for products such as gas-detection systems and last
year’s $1.1 billion purchase of Sperian Protection.  First-quarter revenue increased 15 percent to $8.91
billion. Analysts predicted $8.64 billion on average.  Sales for 2011 will be as much as $36.6 billion, Honeywell
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
