Indian stocks rose for the second
day, led by automakers and lenders, after the weather bureau
predicted normal monsoon rainfall, helping improve outlook on
food inflation.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the nation’s largest maker of
tractors, surged to a three-month high. ICICI Bank Ltd., the
second-biggest lender, gained the most in a week. Rains will be
98 percent of the 50-year average, the  India Meteorological
Department  said yesterday. Agriculture makes up a fifth of
 India’s economy  and a bumper harvest will boost rural incomes,
lifting sales of cars and consumer appliances. Prime Minister
 Manmohan Singh  is betting on normal rainfall to tame food
inflation after it averaged 18 percent in 2010.  “A good monsoon will boost rural economic growth and help
the government control food inflation,” said Shishir Bajpai,
vice president at IIFL Wealth Management Ltd., which advises
clients on investment strategies for assets worth $1.8 billion.
Banks, consumer goods companies and automakers will benefit the
most from an increase in rural demand, he said.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 349.15, or 1.8 percent, to 19,470.98 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock
Exchange added 1.9 percent to 5,851.65 and its April futures
settled at 5,874. The BSE 200 Index increased 1.6 percent to
2,406.89, approaching the three-month high set on April 13.  Mahindra jumped 5.1 percent to 763.25 rupees, its highest
close since Jan. 25. Its April futures traded at 764.15 rupees.
Tata Motors Ltd., the biggest truckmaker, added 4.2 percent to
1,251.75 rupees, ending a three-day decline.  ICICI gained 2.1 percent to 1,112.35 rupees and  State Bank 
of  India , the largest, climbed 2.3 percent to 2,795.15. The
Bombay Stock Exchange’s Bankex Index advanced for a second day,
adding 1.7 percent to 13,457.61.  Borrowing Costs  Expansion in India’s $1.3 trillion economy has increased
consumer demand and spurred manufacturing, car sales and credit
growth, stoking price risks and prompting the central bank to
increase rates eight times since March 2010. Inflation in the
first quarter has exceeded the bank’s forecast that price gains
would be 8 percent by the end of March this year.  The Sensex rallied 9.1 percent in March, the most since
September. The gauge has declined 5.1 percent this year on
concern that rising borrowing costs will crimp economic growth.
Companies on the index trade at an average 16.5 times estimated
earnings, compared with 21.5 times in March 2010, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is valued at
11.6 times.  The rain forecast buoyed fertilizer makers. National
Fertilizers Ltd. gained 1.8 percent to 107.85 rupees. Rashtriya
Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd. climbed 1 percent to 85.4 rupees.  Software Earnings  HCL Technologies Ltd. (HCLT) , the fourth-largest software service
provider, paced gains among its peers after reporting earnings
that beat estimates. HCL surged 9.7 percent to 522.85 rupees.

($106 million), topping the average 4.22 billion rupee estimate
of 25 analysts.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  added 4.6 percent
to 1,218.7 rupees before its earnings tomorrow. The biggest
software maker may report 22 percent jump in fourth-quarter
profit to 23.5 billion rupees, according to the mean of 26
analyst estimates by Bloomberg News.  Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO) , the second-biggest, climbed 0.7
percent to 2,907.3 rupees, the first gain since April 15 when
its fourth-quarter profit trailed analyst estimates. Wipro Ltd,
the third-biggest, added 3.1 percent to 463.65 rupees.  “The software sector will continue to perform till global
and domestic growth is intact,” IIFL’s Bajpai said.  Reliance Earnings  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the most valuable company, rose
1.4 percent to 1,025.9 rupees ahead of its earnings report due

billion rupees, according to the mean of 14 analyst estimates by
Bloomberg News.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the top aluminum

in equity this year to 37.3 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  India’s economic growth and corporate earnings lured
foreign investors to buy a record $29.4 billion of local
equities last year and made the Sensex the best performer and
most expensive among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
