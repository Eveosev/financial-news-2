European Union  traders, refiners
and producers will be allowed to import a maximum of about 5,416
metric tons of duty-free sugar each this marketing season,
according to data from the bloc.  Each will be able to purchase 1.8053 percent of the 300,000
tons of the sweetener the bloc plans to import at zero duty,
data in the Official Journal of the European Union today showed.
Applications were received for import licenses covering 16.6
million tons, according to the European Commission, the bloc’s
regulatory arm.  The EU’s sugar management committee backed the plans on
March 10 after prices rose to a 30-year high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
