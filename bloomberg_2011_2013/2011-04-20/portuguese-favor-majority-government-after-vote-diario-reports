The Portuguese favor having a
government backed by a majority in parliament after the June 5
election, Diario Economico reported, citing a survey.  About 71 percent of those surveyed said itâ€™s very important
that  Portugal  has a government with a parliamentary majority,
the Portuguese newspaper reported. If there is a coalition
government after the vote, 58 percent of those surveyed said the
opposition  Social Democratic Party  should be part of government,
according to the newspaper.  Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, who also leads the
ruling Socialist Party, is seen as having more responsibility
for the crisis Portugal is facing, according to 64.8 percent of
respondents, Diario said. Socrates on April 6 requested
financial assistance from the European Union.  The survey published today was carried out by Marktest from
April 11 to 13, and 803 people were interviewed, the newspaper
said. The margin of error is 3.46 percent, Diario said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
