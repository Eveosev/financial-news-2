Bangkok Bank Pcl (BBL) ,  Thailand ’s
biggest commercial lender by assets, said first-quarter profit
rose 8.2 percent from a year earlier as lending rates increased.  Net income reached 6.47 billion baht ($216 million), or
3.39 baht a share, in the three months ended March, compared
with a restated 5.98 billion baht, or 3.13 baht, a year earlier,
the company said in a statement today. That compares with a 6.84
billion-baht median estimate of eight analysts in a survey
compiled by Bloomberg.  Bangkok Bank follows smaller rivals  Kasikornbank Pcl (KBANK)  and
Siam Commercial Bank Pcl in reporting profit increases driven by
higher  interest rates  and growing loan portfolios. Thailand’s
central bank raised borrowing costs today for the sixth time in
less than a year as policy makers strive to damp inflation
stoked by surging commodity prices and capital inflows.  The Bangkok-based lender’s net interest income rose 9.2
percent in the first quarter to 11.9 billion baht, while net fee
and service income gained 11 percent to 4.82 billion baht.  The bank’s loan portfolio in the quarter grew 14 percent
from the same period last year to 1.31 trillion baht.
Nonperforming loans fell to 43.4 billion baht, or 2.8 percent of
total lending, compared with 3 percent of total loans at end-
2010, according to the statement.  The bank expects its loan portfolio to expand between 6
percent and 8 percent this year, Chartsiri Sophonpanich, the
bank’s president, said on Feb. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
