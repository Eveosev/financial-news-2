Slovakia plans to introduce a legal
limit for state debt as the second-youngest euro-region member
wants to prevent the region’s fiscal crisis from spreading.  The government approved a  framework  for additional economic
reforms, which envisages legislation that would automatically
restrict spending if the level of state debt approaches the
European Union’s limit of 60 percent of economic output, Finance
Minister Ivan Miklos told reporters today in Bratislava.  The plan also calls for creating a Fiscal Council, an
independent body to assess prospects for public finances and
alert the public should they deteriorate.  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, is working on
narrowing its  budget deficit  after it ballooned to 8 percent of
gross domestic product in 2009 when the economy contracted. The
administration of Iveta Radicova has raised value-added tax and
cut spending to trim the fiscal gap to 4.9 percent this year and
below the EU limit of 3 percent two years later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
