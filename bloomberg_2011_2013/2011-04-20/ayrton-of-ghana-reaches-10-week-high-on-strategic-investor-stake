Ayrton Drug Manufacturing Ltd. (AYRTN) , a
manufacturer of pharmaceutical products in  Ghana , rose to the
highest since Feb. 3 on speculation a “strategic investor”
acquired a stake in the company.  The stock gained 1 pesewa, or 6.3 percent, to close at 17
pesewas as of 2:40 p.m. in the capita, Accra.  “A strategic investor was taking a position in the
company,” Hilary Lomotey, a trader with  Renaissance Capital 
said in a telephone interview from Accra, declining to give
details. “The person has an interest in a pharmaceuticals
company and Ayrton Drug is the biggest in terms of market
capitalization on  Ghana ’s market.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
