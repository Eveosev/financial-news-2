Tokyo Electric  Power Co. and Tohoku
Electric Power Co. will receive 1 milliion tons of liquefied
natural gas from Indonesia this year as they try to secure
supplies after nuclear power stations were knocked out by last
month’s quake and tsunami, the Nikkei newspaper  reported .  Indonesia’s government agreed to allow the shipments, which
will probably come from excess LNG at the Bontang export
terminal in Kalminantan that was set aside for spot markets, the
Nikkei said, citing people it didn’t identify.  The Japanese power companies will receive initial shipments
totaling 400,000 tons, the Nikkei said. Shipments have started
for Tohoku Electric and loading of vessels for Tokyo Electric,
known as Tepco, is due to begin soon, the report said.  Indonesia  will ship a further 600,000 tons of LNG to the
two utilities by the second half of the year, the Nikkei said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
