PT Astra International isn’t aware
of any plans to boost the production capacity of  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  vehicles in Indonesia, Yulian Warman, head of Astra’s
public relations division, said by phone today in Jakarta.  Warman’s comments contradict an earlier confirmation by the
company that Astra planned to increase output of  Toyota vehicles .  Kontan newspaper reported earlier that Astra plans to
increase production of Toyota vehicles to 200,000 units a year
from 150,000 units.  Astra’s current Toyota vehicle production is 100,000 units
a year, Yalman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
