AES Corp. (AES) , the U.S. power utility
with operations in 28 countries, plans to add 500,000 customers
in the Dayton, Ohio, area with its $3.5 billion cash purchase of
 DPL Inc. (DPL)   AES will pay $30 a share for DPL, according to a statement
today. That’s an 8.7 percent premium to yesterday’s closing
price of $27.59 a share. AES, based in Arlington,  Virginia , also
will assume $1.2 billion in net debt.  Using the Ohio company’s average price over the past 20
days, the premium is 9.5 percent, the lowest of seven cash
transactions for U.S. utility companies in the past five years.
The average of the other six transactions was 26 percent,
Bloomberg data show.  “This is a relatively low price for a takeover,” Tim Winter, a St. Louis-based analyst for Gabelli & Co., who doesn’t
rate either stock and owns none, said today in an interview.
“AES already owns Indianapolis Power & Light, which, while not
adjacent, gives them increased scale.”  Gabelli, based in Rye,  New York , owned 1.2 million AES
shares and about 944,000 DPL shares as of Dec. 31, according to
filings compiled by Bloomberg.  AES rose 41 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $12.88 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. DPL had its
biggest gain since October 2008, climbing $2.58, or 9.4 percent,
to $30.17.  DPL probably is trading above the offer price to account
for dividends expected before the deal closes, said Ted Chen, a
New York-based arbitrage analyst for Jefferies & Co. Inc. who
doesn’t rate or own either stock.  Accelerating Deals  Consolidation in the U.S. power industry has gathered pace
as companies seek to cut administrative expenses and reduce
borrowing costs to finance new plants and power lines and add
more pollution controls. Power companies have announced $31.6
billion of transactions this year, compared with $32.8 billion
for all of 2010 and $3.7 billion in 2009, according to Bloomberg
data.  In January,  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  announced plans to acquire
 Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  for $13.7 billion in stock, creating the
largest U.S. utility.  By applying $1.6 billion of accrued net operating losses to
the transaction, AES expects to make no cash tax payment on the
deal, Chief Executive Officer Paul Hanrahan said today on an
investor call. The acquisition, expected to close by year-end,
will add as much as 7 cents a share to profit in 2012, AES said.
The company expects to harvest $300 million in cash from DPL
annually.  Generating Capacity  The net operating losses also can be used to reduce taxes
on the companies’ combined U.S. income, Dave Parker, a Tampa,
Florida-based analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co., said today in
an interview. Parker rates DPL shares “neutral” and owns none.  DPL operates  power plants  with a generating capacity of
3,800 megawatts, with 99 percent of its output from coal-burning
plants. About 80 percent of DPL’s coal plants are fitted with
pollution controls that should enable them to remain profitable
under tightening U.S. air pollution rules that may require other
Midwestern coal plants to shut, Hanrahan said.  AES has 40,500 megawatts of generating capacity and 11.5
million customers. Sales in 2010 amounted to about $17 billion
and the company controls about $41 billion in total assets, AES
said in the statement.  UBS AG (UBS)  and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft LLP are advising
DPL on the transaction. Bank of America Corp. and Skadden Arps
Slate Meagher & Flom LLP are counseling AES.  To contact the reporters on this story:
