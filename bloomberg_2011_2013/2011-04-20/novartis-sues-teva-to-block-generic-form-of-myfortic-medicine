Novartis AG,  Europe ’s second-
biggest drugmaker by sales, sued  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. (TEVA)  in a U.S. court alleging infringement of patents for
Myfortic, used to help prevent  organ rejection  in kidney
transplant patients.  Teva has applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
for permission to market copies of delayed-release Myfortic
before the three Novartis patents expire, Novartis said in a
complaint filed today in federal court in Wilmington,  Delaware .  “Teva’s products, if approved, will be administered to
human patients in an amount effective to immunosupress those
patients” in violation of Novartis’ intellectual property
rights, according to the complaint.  Novartis, based in Basel, Switzerland, gained the most in
four months in Zurich yesterday after sales and profit for the
first quarter exceeded analysts’ estimates. The shares rose 1.35
Swiss francs to 51.65 francs today.  The company is asking for an order to confirm infringement,
an injunction against U.S. sales and unspecified damages,
according to court documents.  Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Petach Tikva, Israel-
based Teva, said in an e-mail that the company had no comment on
the lawsuit.  Teva’s American depositary receipts, each worth one
ordinary share, rose 50 cents to $49.17 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading.  The case is  Novartis AG (NOVN)  v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.,
11CV353, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
