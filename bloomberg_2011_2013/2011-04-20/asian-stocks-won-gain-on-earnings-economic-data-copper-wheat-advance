Global stocks staged the biggest
rally of 2011 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  reached an
almost three-year high amid better-than-estimated results at
companies from  Intel Corp. (INTC)  to United Technologies Corp. and
L’Oreal SA. Gold jumped to a record as the dollar slid.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index jumped 2 percent at 4 p.m. in New
York, the biggest increase since Nov. 4, and emerging-market
shares rallied the most in 10 months. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index climbed 1.4 percent. The U.S. currency weakened versus all
16 major peers, dragging the Dollar Index to the lowest level
since November 2009. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields rose four
basis points to 3.41 percent. Sugar and nickel led commodities
higher and gold traded above $1,500 an ounce for a second day.  Technology shares led gains after Intel said late yesterday
revenue may top analysts’ estimates in the second quarter.
 L’Oreal SA (OR) , the world’s largest cosmetics maker, reported sales
climbed 9.3 percent and  South Korea ’s  LG Chem Ltd. (051910)  posted a 27
percent jump in profit. Earnings-per-share exceeded predictions
for 76 percent of the 59 companies in the  S&P 500  that reported
results since April 11, helping revive investor confidence after
S&P cut its rating outlook for  U.S. debt  on April 18.  “The risk-on trade is in full-blown mode,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Philadelphia-based
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages $53 billion. “The
surprise factor was sort of being lost in the market. The good
corporate earnings across the board reinforce the idea that the
global recovery is in place. As a consequence, equities and
commodities are feeling the benefits of that.”  April 18 Plunge Erased  The S&P 500 climbed for the fifth time in six days and
erased its 1.1 plunge on April 18. Intel surged 7.8 percent, the
most in two years. Yahoo! Inc. climbed 4.7 percent as the most-
visited U.S. Web portal had first-quarter sales that topped
estimates.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the maker of the iPhone that is scheduled
to report results after markets close today, climbed 1.4
percent. United Technologies, maker of Carrier air conditioners
and Pratt & Whitney engine parts, surged 4.3 percent to $85.90,
its highest close since at least 1980.  Intel and United Technologies led the Dow up 186.79 points,
or 1.5 percent, to 12,453.54, its highest closing level since
June 2008.  Stocks extended gains after sales of previously owned U.S.
homes increased 3.7 percent to a 5.1 million annual rate in
March, exceeding the 5 million median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, figures from the National
Association of Realtors showed. The median price declined from a
year earlier, and 40 percent of the sales were distressed
properties.  European Stocks  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 1.7 percent, the most
in a month.  STMicroelectronics NV (STM) , Europe’s biggest chipmaker,
climbed 5 percent and  ASML Holding NV (ASML) , the largest
semiconductor-equipment maker, jumped 5.3 percent. L’Oreal SA
rose 3.2 percent. PSA Peugeot Citroen gained 4.7 percent as
Europe’s second-biggest automaker posted a 10 percent increase
in first-quarter revenue.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index jumped 2.5 percent, the
steepest gain since June. A measure of technology stocks in the
gauge rallied 3.7 percent for the biggest gain since May 2009.
South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  jumped 2.2 percent to a record, while
 Taiwan ’s Taiex Index increased 2 percent. Russia’s benchmark
stock index rose 1.6 percent on higher oil, while benchmarks in
 Poland ,  Hungary  and  South Africa  rallied at least 1.3 percent.  Commodities Rally  The S&P GSCI index of 24 commodities climbed 1.8 percent.

oil jumped 2.9 percent to $111.45 a barrel in  New York .  Gold for June delivery rallied as much as 0.8 percent to a
record $1,506.50 an ounce.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against six
major peers, tumbled 0.9 percent to 74.351, the lowest since
November 2009.  The euro strengthened 1.2 percent to $1.4511, its highest
level since January 2010. The pound weakened 0.7 percent versus
the euro after minutes from the  Bank of England  showed policy
makers voted 6-3 to keep  interest rates  on hold this month as
the majority said that data on the economy over the previous
month had “probably been to the downside.”  Canada ’s dollar touched the highest level against its U.S.
counterpart since November 2007 as gains in stocks and
commodities boosted demand for currencies most-linked to
economic growth. The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, pared
gains before a report tomorrow forecast to show the nation’s
retail sales rose in February.  The Swedish krona advanced 0.3 percent against the euro
after the central bank raised its benchmark repo rate for the
sixth time since July, and kept a forecast for coming increases
unchanged.  Thailand ’s baht strengthened 0.4 percent versus the
dollar after the Bank of Thailand increased the one-day bond
repurchase rate for a third time this year.  U.S.,  Europe  Bonds  Treasuries fell, snapping a three-day gain, with the five-
year note yield advancing five basis points to 2.11 percent.
Thirty-year U.S. bond yields increased three basis points to

Europe’s government-debt crisis.  The yield on Irish 10-year debt jumped 26 basis points to
10.07 percent, increasing for the sixth day, the longest run of
gains since Feb. 15. The Portuguese 10-year yield advanced 19
basis points, climbing for the seventh day, with the Greek yield
up 27 basis points.  The cost of insuring debt sold by  Greece  and  Portugal  rose
to records, according to traders of credit-default swaps.
Contracts on Greece jumped 62 basis points to 1,303 basis points
according to closing prices in  London , signaling a 67 percent
chance of default within five years. Portugal climbed 24 basis
points to 636.  To contact the reporters on this story:
