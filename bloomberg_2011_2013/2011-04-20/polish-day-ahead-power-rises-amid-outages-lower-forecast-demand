Polish day-ahead electricity prices
increased in the past week amid outages. Forecasts for lower
demand over the Easter holidays may push prices lower.  Next-day baseload power climbed 2 percent to 217.45 zloty
($79.63) a megawatt-hour in the week ending today, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on Polish Power Exchange data.  Average daily electricity demand was as high as 18,900
megawatts this week, down 1 percent from last week’s maximum
daily average, according to  system load data .  Maximum temperatures in Warsaw may rise to 22 degrees
Celsius (72 Fahrenheit) on April 27 from today’s high of 17
degrees, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, demand is expected to fall from April 22 through
April 25, a forecast from the Polish power grid operator, PSE
Operator SA shows.  Power producers in  Poland  halted 1,415 megawatts of
generation capacity last weekend, 375 megawatts more than a week
earlier, according to data from PSE Operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
