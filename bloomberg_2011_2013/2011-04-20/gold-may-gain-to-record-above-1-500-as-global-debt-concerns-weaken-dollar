Gold futures rose to a record for
the ninth time this month as a weakening dollar boosted
investment demand for the precious metal as an alternative
asset. Silver topped $45 an ounce for the first time since 1980.  Gold reached $1,506.50 an ounce in  New York  as the dollar
slipped as much as 1 percent against a basket of six major
currencies to trade at a 16-month low. Gold has risen 32 percent
in the past year as the dollar fell 8.2 percent. Earlier this
week,  Standard & Poor’s  revised its long-term outlook for  U.S.
debt  to negative from stable.  “For the dollar, the S&P statement was like getting kicked
when you’re already down,” said Matt Zeman, a senior market
strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago . “The dollar is
losing its status as the king of the hill, and gold is looking
to take its place.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $3.80, or 0.3 percent,
to settle at $1,498.90 at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The most-active contract has posted records for four straight
days.  Gold for immediate delivery in  London  rose as much as 0.6
percent, to a record $1,506.03 an ounce.  The Treasury Department has projected that the government
will reach the $14.3 trillion debt-ceiling limit no later than
May 16 and run out of options for avoiding default by early
July.  “As the numbers show, the debt cannot be repaid without
dollar debasement, so people are warming up to the idea of
hoarding gold,” Zeman said.  Commodity Inflation  Gold also gained on demand for an inflation hedge. The
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities rose as
much as 1.7 percent. A U.S. gauge of traders’ inflation
expectations approached the highest level since 2008.  “The dollar has lost ground to its major counterparts,”
 James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London, said in
a report to clients. “The mix of inflation, currency
debasement, euro-zone debt and Middle East and North African
unrest continues to fuel investment demand.”  The difference between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader
expectations for inflation, today widened to as much as 2.66
percentage points. The spread reached 2.67 percentage points on
April 11, the most in three years.  Silver Surges  Silver futures for May delivery rose 54.8 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $44.461 on the Comex, after touching $45.40, the
highest since January 1980. That year, the price reached a
record $50.35.  An ounce of gold bought as little as 33.59 ounces of silver
in London today, the smallest ratio since August 1983, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The metals are being led by silver,” said  Frank McGhee ,
the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago.
“You’ve got a parabolic market forming. The general opinion is
that silver is undervalued, and that feeds the rally.”  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $27.80, or 3.8
percent, to $758.90 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Platinum futures for July delivery rose $31.50, or 1.8
percent, to $1,802.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
