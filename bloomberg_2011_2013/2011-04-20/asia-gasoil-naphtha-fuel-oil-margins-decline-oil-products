Asia  refining margins for gasoil,
naphtha and  fuel oil  fell for a third day on concern that rising
fuel prices will reduce demand while crude costs climb.  Light Distillates  Naphtha swaps rose 1.1 percent to $1,038.25 a metric ton at
10:33 a.m. Singapore time, according to PVM Oil Associates, a
London-based broker. The crack spread, a measure of the refining
margin for processing  Brent crude  into the petrochemical
feedstock, dropped to $120.16 a ton from $125.81 at the end of
Asian trading yesterday, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Japan ’s inventories of naphtha rose to 2.07 million
kiloliters, gaining 270,122 kiloliters in the week to April 16,
the Petroleum Association of Japan said today. Gasoline supplies
also increased by 78,700 kiloliters to 2.33 million, the group
said.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit for the fuel, declined 36 cents to $20.94 a barrel, PVM
data showed. May swaps for gasoil rose 0.4 percent to $135.35 a
barrel.  The regrade, or jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, was at 85
cents a barrel, unchanged from yesterday.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 32 cents to
$11.41 a barrel, PVM data showed. High-sulfur fuel oil swaps for
May rose $3.50, or 0.5 percent, to $669.50 a ton.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
fuel oil gained 50 cents to $14.75 a barrel. A wider spread
signals that prices of the less-viscous grade used at  power
plants  rose more than the grade used as shipping fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
