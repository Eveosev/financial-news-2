OAO Polymetal slid the most in more
than four months after the Russian gold and silver producer cut
its forecast for output of the precious metals this year due to
“schedule setbacks” at its Amursk and Omolon projects.  The shares dropped 3.8 percent to 554.10 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, their weakest level since April 4.  Polymetal was one of three stocks on the Micex Index that
fell. The 30-stock gauge advanced for a second day, climbing 1.6
percent to 1,783.38, its highest in a week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
