Germany ’s government may
indefinitely extend security laws stemming from the Sept. 11,
2001 terrorist attacks,  Die Welt  reported, citing a draft law by
Interior Minister  Hans-Peter Friedrich .  Some provisions, in particular those regarding the
competences of intelligence services, would be made “tougher,”
