Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said
Russia is succeeding in its effort to turn the ruble into a
regional reserve currency as other former Soviet republics adopt
it for trade.  “In the post-Soviet space, the ruble is strengthening and
becoming a reserve currency,” helping Moscow become an
international financial center, Putin told lawmakers in Moscow
today.  Ukraine has requested settling purchases of energy products
in rubles and Belarus uses the currency for 80 percent to 90
percent of its non-cash transactions with Russia, Putin said.  The world’s biggest energy supplier has been encouraging
greater use of local currencies in trade and investment to
reduce a reliance on dollars. President  Dmitry Medvedev  said at
the St. Petersburg economic forum last June that he wants to
boost the ruble’s place in central bank reserves.  Russia  also has agreements that allow the use of the ruble
and yuan in cross-border trade and is in talks with India and
Brazil to use their currencies in trade, First Deputy Central
Bank Chairman Alexei Ulyukayev has said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
