PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) , the world’s
fourth-biggest maker of caustic soda, declared force majeure on
North American deliveries of the chemical used to make pulp,
alumina and soap because of a factory shutdown.  PPG’s Natrium plant near New Martinsville, West Virginia,
has a mechanical problem, Jeremy Neuhart, a company spokesman,
said today by telephone. The plant, which makes chlorine and
caustic, known collectively as chlor-alkali, probably will be
down for a “short” period, he said.  “There may be limited ability to meet customer demand,”
Neuhart said.  Force majeure is a legal clause allowing the suspension of
deliveries because of circumstances beyond the supplier’s
control.  Georgia Gulf Corp. (GGC)  declared force majeure last week on
shipments of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, partly because of
operating problems at its chlor-alkali plant in Plaquemine,
Louisiana.  PPG rose $1.40, or 1.5 percent, to $4.54 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 12 percent this year.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  is the world’s largest producer of chlor-
alkali, followed by  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  and  Olin Corp. (OLN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
