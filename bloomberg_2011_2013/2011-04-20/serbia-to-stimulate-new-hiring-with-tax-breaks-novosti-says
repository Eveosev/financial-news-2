Serbia plans tax breaks for
employers who add jobs, cutting some of the duties they pay for
workers by as much as 50 percent,  Vecernje Novosti  newspaper
reported, citing Deputy Prime Minister Verica Kalanovic.  The 50 percent reduction will apply to the income tax
portion paid by employers on salaries of new hires in the first
year of employment, followed by 40 percent in the second and 20
percent in the third year, Kalanovic said, according to the
report.  The state may also decide to subsidize what employers pay
for workersâ€™ health care, while the mandatory payments to the
state-run pension fund will remain the same, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
