Korea East-West Power Co., one of
the six generating units of  Korea Electric Power Corp ., plans to
buy as much as 72,000 metric tons of medium-sulfur fuel oil for
delivery between March 17 and March 21, according to a tender
invitation.  The table below gives details of the purchase.       The oilâ€™s centistoke rating is a measure of its viscosity,
or flow rate, when heated.  Fuel oil  with a higher centistoke
rating has a slower flow rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
