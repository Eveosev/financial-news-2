The revision of an economic growth
forecast in Slovakia for this year will have little effect on
tax revenue, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The February revision of the 2011 growth forecast to 3.4
percent from an originally projected 3.3 percent will boost tax
revenue by 9 million euros ($12.3 million), representing less
than 0.1 percent of gross domestic product, the  ministry  said
today in a statement from Bratislava, Slovakia.  Tax revenue next year is set to exceed the original
projection by 36 million euros, while in 2013 the government
will probably collect 85 million euros less than planned, the
ministry said. The 2012 and 2013 growth forecast was revised to
4.8 percent for each year, from 4.5 percent and 4.7 percent,
respectively.  Slovakia is relying on foreign demand to boost economic
growth after the eastern euro-zone member slipped into recession
in 2009. The government wants to cut the  budget deficit  below
the European Union’s limit of 3 percent of GDP by 2013 from an
estimated 7.8 percent of GDP last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
