French stocks retreated, following
falling equity markets across Europe, as Libya’s leader Muammar Qaddafi said he’s the leader of a revolution that requires
“sacrifice until the end of life”, defying a growing revolt.  Cie. de Saint-Gobain dropped 2.1 percent, leading
industrial stocks lower.  Societe Generale  SA fell 2.2 percent,
leading declines among financial shares.  Air France-KLM  Group,
Europe’s second-biggest airline by sales, slipped 3 percent as

4,050.27 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Paris, falling for a second
day. The SBF 120 Index retreated 1.1 percent.  Oil surged to the highest price since September 2008 as
soldiers deserted Qaddafi’s government and diplomats resigned in
protest over a crackdown on anti-government demonstrators that
has left hundreds dead.  Libya, the holder of Africa’s largest oil reserves, is the
latest Arab nation to be rocked by protests ignited by last
month’s ouster of Tunisia’s president and fanned by the Feb. 11
departure of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.  Saint-Gobain,  Europe ’s biggest supplier of building
