Global expenditure on weapons
increased by almost 60 percent in real terms between 2002 and
2009, according to the latest report from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, the Guardian reported.  The total in 2009 was more than $400 billion, the newspaper
cited the institute, known as Sipri, as saying.  Susan Jackson, an arms industry expert at Sipri, described
military spending by the U.S. government as crucial for sales
increases by American weapons producers and military-services
suppliers, and for European companies with a foothold in that
market, the Guardian said.    Lockheed Martin Corp . was the world’s leading weapons
supplier, with 2009 sales of $33.43 billion, followed by
Britain’s BAE Systems Plc, with sales of $33.25 billion, the
newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
