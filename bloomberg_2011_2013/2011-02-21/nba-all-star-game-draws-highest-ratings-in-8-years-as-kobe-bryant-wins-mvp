The National Basketball Association
All-Star Game drew its highest television rating since Michael Jordan’s final appearance as  Kobe Bryant  was named Most Valuable
Player for a record-tying fourth time.  The game at Staples Center in Los Angeles was seen in an
average of 5.2 percent of U.S. households on  Time Warner Inc .’s
TNT, according to preliminary national data, the network said in
a news release, citing Nielsen Media Research. That’s 37 percent
higher than last year’s rating and the highest since Jordan’s
final appearance in an All-Star Game in 2003.  Bryant, of the Los Angeles Lakers, had 37 points and 14
rebounds in the West’s 148-143 win yesterday, joining Hall of
Famer Bob Pettit as the only players to claim the MVP award four
times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
