Frosts in  Russia  will persist until
March, though winter crops will remain safe because they’re
covered with snow, according to the national weather center.  “Snow lay practically all over Russia, and it protects
crops from frost-killing,” Roman Vilfand, director of the
Federal Hydrometeorological Center, said in Moscow today.
“There’s no fear because temperatures at crops’ roots have not
declined below 12 to 14 degrees Centigrade. Temperatures below
this usually lead to frost-killing.”  Cold weather next month would have no effect on the timing
of spring sowing in Russia, according to Vilfand, who also said
the center is forecasting a milder summer than last year. Russia
suffered its worst drought in at least half a century in 2010,
sparking wildfires and cutting into the grain harvest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
