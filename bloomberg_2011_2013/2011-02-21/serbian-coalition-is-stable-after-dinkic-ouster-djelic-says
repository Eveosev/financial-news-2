  Serbia ’s ruling coalition is stable
and is working toward the country becoming a European Union
candidate this year, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said.  Lawmakers in Belgrade are set to vote today on the
dismissal of Deputy Prime Minister Mladjan Dinkic, raising the
prospect of early elections a year before the balloting due in
March 2012. Dinkic is the leader of the G17 Plus party, part of
Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic ’s three-way governing coalition.  Cvetkovic’s government is the longest-serving Serbian
Cabinet since the 2000 fall of  Slobodan Milosevic . Over the past
decade, no single government lasted its full, four-year term.  "The government is stable, thank you for asking," Djelic
told a parliamentary committee on Feb. 18. "As all leaders of
the coalition parties reiterated over the past few days, they
all remain committed to our country’s European future and will
do nothing to jeopardize Serbia’s European path."  EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule will visit Belgrade
on Oct. 12 to give an assessment of Serbia’s fitness for
candidacy to be an EU candidate, Djelic told the committee,
adding that the current political situation in Serbia won’t
hamper the EU goal.  Progress toward the EU partly hinges on the arrest and
extradition of two remaining war crimes fugitives, Ratko Mladic
and  Goran Hadzic , to the United Nation’s War Crimes Tribunal in
The Hague.  -- Editors: Balazs Penz, James M. Gomez  To contact the reporter on this story:
