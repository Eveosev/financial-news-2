  Standard & Poor’s  said downgrades on
asset-backed securities accelerated in  Europe  in the last
quarter because of the region’s budget deficit crisis and
uncertainty over the economic recovery.  Downgrades totaled 388 and upgrades 141 during the last
three months of 2010, the New York-based company said in a note
to investors. That compares with 352 downgrades and 157 upgrades
in the previous quarter.  “Credit fundamentals affecting European securitizations
were marked by continued uncertainty regarding the strength and
sustainability of the economic recovery, as well as by further
shocks related to sovereign creditworthiness,” Arnaud Checconi,
a London-based analyst at S&P, said in the note.  Structured credit transactions, including collateralized
debt obligations, accounted for 54 percent of the total number
of ratings cut in the period, the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
