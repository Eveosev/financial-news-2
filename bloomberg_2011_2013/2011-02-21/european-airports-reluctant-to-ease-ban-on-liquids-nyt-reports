European Union airports remain
reluctant to partially lift a five-year old ban on passengers
carrying liquids in carry-on bags because they say technology
needed to detect liquid explosives is still too unreliable, the
New York Times reported, citing Olivier Jankovec, director
general of the Airports Council International Europe.    France  also has backed industry demands for a delay in
adopting the news measures, and transporttion officials from
other countries have also requested reassurance that air safety
will be maintained without disruption, the newspaper said.  The lobbying has so far failed to deter the European
Commission, which remains committed to simplying security
screening, the Times added.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
