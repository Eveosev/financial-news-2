The  Swiss Bankers Association  said
it wants a dialogue with the Swiss foreign ministry in cases of
uncertainty about “exposed personalities” such as foreign
politicians, Schweizer Fernsehen  reported , citing  Renate Schwob ,
a member of the executive board of the association.  Such an exchange of information could lead to a joint  risk
assessment  on whether a foreign politician should be able to
open a bank account, Schwob said in the interview to be aired on
Swiss television tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
