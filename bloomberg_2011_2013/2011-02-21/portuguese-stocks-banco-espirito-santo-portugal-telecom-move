Portugal’s  PSI-20 Index  sank 174.6,
or 2.2 percent, to 7,855.73 at the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in
Lisbon, the biggest decline in six weeks.  The following are among the most active stocks in the
Portuguese market today.  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES PL), Portugal’s biggest
publicly traded bank, declined 4 percent to 3.05 euros. Banco
Comercial Portugues SA (BCP PL), the second-largest lender, fell
2.2 percent to 61.9 cents. European Central Bank council member
Athanasios Orphanides said there was “particular urgency” to
Portugal’s struggle to repay its debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an interview.    Portugal Telecom SGPS SA  (PTC PL), Portugal’s biggest
telecommunications company, dropped 2.4 percent to 8.27 euros.
Spain’s Telefonica SA offers better value and growth that  Portugal  Telecom as it has half the domestic exposure and faster
growing assets in Latin America, UBS AG analyst Keval Khiroya
said in a note. He has a “neutral” recommendation for the
Portuguese stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
