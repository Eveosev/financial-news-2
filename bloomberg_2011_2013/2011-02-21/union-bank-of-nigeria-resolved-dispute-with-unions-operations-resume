Union Bank of Nigeria Plc ended a
dispute with the Nigerian Labor Congress over participation of
employees in trade unionism, bank spokesman Francis Barde said.  “The disagreement between the labor unions and the bank
has been resolved, so things are now back to normal,” Barde
said in a phone interview today from Lagos, the commercial
capital.  The Nigerian Labor Congress started a protest against Union
Bank on Feb. 14 after the bank stopped its workers from
belonging to an affiliated union. The lender prevented employees
from joining the Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance
and Financial Institutions, NLC’s President Abdulwaheed Omar
said in a statement posted on the congress’s website on Feb. 10.  “Union Bank has agreed to recognize the workers union; it
will also reinstate all workers sacked on account of their union
membership,” Ismail Bello, a member of the national executive
council of the Nigerian Labor Congress, said by phone today.
“The bank has also agreed to rescind its decision to transfer
some workers on account of their union membership.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
