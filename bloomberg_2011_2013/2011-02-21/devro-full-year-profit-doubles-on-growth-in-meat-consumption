  Devro Plc , Britain’s biggest maker
of collagen sausage casings, said 2010 profit doubled as more
meat was consumed in Latin America, East Europe and  Asia  and the
more manufacturers switched from gut-based skins to collagen in
all markets.  Net income climbed to 42.2 million pounds ($68.5 million),
or 25.3 pence a share, compared with 20.2 million pounds, or
12.2 pence a share, a year ago, the Chryston, U.K.-based company
said in a statement today. Revenue rose 7.5 percent to 237
million pounds.  “Our strongest markets are  China  and  Russia ,” Chief
Executive Officer Peter Page said in a conference call today.  China, the world’s most populous nation, is consuming more
meat because of rising income among the middle-classes.  Devro announced today that one of their “most experienced
directors” is moving to  Hong Kong  to exploit opportunities in
China and south-east Asia.  Devro expects total sales volumes to grow 4 percent a year
in line with the growth in demand for collagen casings, Peter Williams, the finance director, said on the call. The sausage
casings maker plans to make a capital investment of 45 million
pounds this year, which will increase production capacity by 8
percent in 2012 and 2013.  The extra investment will not require extra funds from
shareholders, Devro said.  Adverse weather in December caused difficulties at Devro’s
plants in the U.K., the U.S. and  Australia  and cut operating
profit by about 600,000 pounds because of lower sales, higher
costs and lost production.  Devro shares rose to their highest in almost three months,
adding 4.7 percent to 243 pence a share in London trading today.
The stock rose 3 percent to 239 pence at 8:55 a.m., giving the
company a market value of 391 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
