Moody’s Investors Service expects
“additional defaults” in the U.S. municipal bond markets, the
Financial Times reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer Raymond McDaniel.  “There may be additional defaults in the municipal
sector,” McDaniel said, the newspaper reported. “There is
certainly going to be distress.”  Moody’s does not rule out the “very unlikely” possibility
of municipal defaults leading to systemic risks, McDaniel said,
the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
