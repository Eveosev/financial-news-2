  Zimbabwe ’s government may miss its
revenue target of $2.7 billion for this year because of sluggish
economic growth, the state-controlled  Herald  reported, citing
Finance Minister  Tendai Biti .  The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority received $156 million in the
first six weeks of 2011, against a target of $252 million, Biti
said, according to the Harare-based newspaper today.  The government’s wage bill continues to take up more than
70 percent of state revenue, the Herald reported, citing Biti.  To contact the reporter on this story:
