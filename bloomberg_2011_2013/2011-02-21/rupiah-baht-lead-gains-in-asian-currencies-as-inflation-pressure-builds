  Indonesia ’s rupiah and  Thailand ’s
baht led gains among Asian currencies on speculation policy
makers will tolerate further appreciation as the region’s
economies improve and inflationary pressure builds.  Thailand’s economy grew at the fastest pace since 1995 last
year, data showed today. Singapore said last week it will temper
rising prices via its currency policy, while Malaysia’s ringgit
traded near a 13-year high after a report on Feb. 18 showed
gross domestic product increased more than economists forecast
last quarter. Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 nations agreed
yesterday to start crafting an early warning system to detect
global economic imbalances.  “Asian central banks may tolerate some currency
appreciation to curb import-price gains as inflationary pressure
is growing,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at Mizuho
Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The growth story in  Asia  is still
intact and that will help attract funds into the region.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.2 percent to 8,843 per dollar as
of 3:34 p.m. in Jakarta and the baht added 0.2 percent from Feb.
17 to 30.55, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Financial
markets in Thailand were closed on Feb. 18 for a public holiday.
The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.366, according to
Taipei Forex Inc.  China’s yuan advanced to a 17-year high on speculation
policy makers will let the currency rise to help tame inflation.
Asia’s largest economy reported Feb. 15 that consumer prices
increased 4.9 percent in January from a year earlier, faster
than 4.6 percent in December. Central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan was cited by  China  Business News today as saying in
Paris on Feb. 18 that exporters have more room to survive
appreciation.  Yuan Strengthens  “A combination of a stronger yuan, reserve-requirement
ratio hikes and interest rates will be used to contain
inflation,” said  Patrick Bennett , a Hong Kong-based strategist
at Standard Bank Group Ltd. The currency’s gain “isn’t linked
to the G-20” and “the phrasing remains vague and allows plenty
of wiggle room for countries to manage how they see fit,” he
said.  The yuan strengthened 0.10 percent to 6.5668 and reached
6.5654, the highest since China unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System in  Shanghai .  The rupiah reached its strongest level since June 2007
after global funds bought $274 million more local stocks than
they sold last week. The nation’s central bank boosted its
benchmark interest rate for the first time since October 2008
this month after inflation climbed to a 21-month high of 7.02
percent in January. The bank lifted its policy rate by a quarter
percentage point to 6.75 percent.  More Rate Increases    Bank Indonesia  is expected to raise interest rates in
March by 25 basis points,” said Joanna Tan, a regional
economist at Forecast Singapore Pte.  The baht reached its strongest level in almost a month as
data today showed the economy grew 7.8 percent in 2010. The Bank
of Thailand lifted its one-day bond repurchase rate by a quarter
point on Jan. 12 to 2.25 percent and signaled further increases,
citing inflationary pressure. Consumer prices rose 3.03 percent
in January from a year earlier, the most in five months,
according to data released Feb. 1.  Elsewhere,  India ’s rupee strengthened 0.1 percent to
45.1375, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Singapore ’s
dollar and Malaysia’s ringgit were little changed versus the
greenback at S$1.2746 and 3.0347 respectively. The Philippine
peso declined 0.2 percent to 43.41, while  South Korea ’s won slid
0.5 percent to 1,118.03.  To contact the reporters on this story:
