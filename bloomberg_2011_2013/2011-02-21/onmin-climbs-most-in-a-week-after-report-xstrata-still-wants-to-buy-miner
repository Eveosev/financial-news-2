  Lonmin Plc , the world’s third-
largest platinum miner, jumped the most in a week after London’s
Independent on Sunday reported  Xstrata Plc  Chief Executive
Officer Mick Davis as saying the company still wants to buy the
platinum producer.  The stock jumped as much as 2.7 percent to 218.65 rand and
traded 2.1 percent higher at 217.42 rand by 10:03 a.m. in
Johannesburg.  Xstrata, the world’s largest exporter of coal used for
power, owns a 25 percent stake in Lonmin. An unnamed Xstrata
spokesman said that options may include a sale of the 25-percent
stake in Lonmin already owned by Xstrata or an offer for the
remaining shares it doesn’t hold, the Independent on Sunday
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
