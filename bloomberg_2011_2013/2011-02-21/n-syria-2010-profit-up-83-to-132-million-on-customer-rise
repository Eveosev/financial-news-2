MTN Syria, one of two mobile
operators in  Syria , said 2010 profit rose almost 83 percent as
the number of customers and revenue increased.  Net income climbed to 6.2 billion Syrian pounds ($132.3
million) from 3.4 billion pounds in 2009, the company said in a
statement on the  website  of the Syrian Commission on Financial
Markets and Securities. Revenue rose 10 percent to 43.5 billion
pounds and the number of subscribers increased 15 percent to 4.9
million, the company added.  Two government-regulated companies, Syriatel and MTN Syria
SA, operate in the country. About 47 percent of Syria’s
population uses a mobile phone, according to the state news
agency SANA.  Syria is encouraging private industry and foreign
investment in its state-dominated economy to provide long-term
financing for development. To help expand the mobile market, the
government last year approved an auction for a third license and
decided to change the contracts of the two current operators to
build-operate-transfer license protocols.  Syria has called on companies to submit bids for the
auction of its third mobile telecommunications license by the
end of March.  Emirates Telecommunications Corp., the bigger of two phone
companies in the United Arab Emirates,  Saudi Telecom Co .,  Qatar
Telecom , Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS,  Turkey ’s biggest
mobile-phone operator,  France Telecom SA , the country’s largest
phone company, were selected in November to participate in the
bidding.  To contact the reporters on this story:
