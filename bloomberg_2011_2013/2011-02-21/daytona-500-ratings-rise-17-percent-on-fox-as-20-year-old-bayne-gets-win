Preliminary television ratings for
the Daytona 500 were 17 percent higher than a year ago as Trevor
Bayne won stock-car racing’s marquee event one day after his
20th birthday.  Yesterday’s race on Fox was seen in an average of 8.2
percent of U.S. households in the top 56 television markets, Lou D’Ermilio, a spokesman for the  News Corp . network, said in an e-
mail. That’s 17 percent higher than the 7.0 initial rating the
race earned last year, when Jamie McMurray held off a final-lap
surge by Dale Earnhardt Jr. to claim victory.  Bayne, racing in his second Sprint Cup series event, became
the only driver to win the Daytona 500 in his first try since
Lee Petty claimed the inaugural edition in 1959.  To contact the reporter on this story:
