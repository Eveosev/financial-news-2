The Muslim Brotherhood, an Egyptian
opposition group that has been banned since 1954, is starting
preparations to establish a political party under the name
Freedom and Justice.  “Forming this party realizes the hopes and ambitions of
the honorable Egyptian people for a better future,” the group
said in a statement, citing Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie.  Specialized bodies in the group have been asked to prepare
the final draft of the future party’s platform, Badie said.
Membership will be open to “all Egyptians who accept the
party’s platform and orientation,” he said.  The Muslim Brotherhood said it plans to establish itself as
a formal party on Feb. 15. Officially outlawed, the organization
has fielded candidates as independents in previous parliamentary
elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
