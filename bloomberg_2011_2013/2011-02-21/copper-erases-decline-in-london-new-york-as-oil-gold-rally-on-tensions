Copper erased losses, gaining
alongside other commodities including oil and gold, as
geopolitical tensions escalated. Aluminum and nickel reached
their highest levels since 2008.  Three-month copper on the  London  Metal Exchange rose as
much as 0.3 percent to $9,887 a metric ton and traded at $9,885
at 2:28 p.m. in Singapore. The metal earlier fell as much as 0.8
percent after  China ’s central bank on Feb. 18 announced an
increase in reserve requirement ratios for a second time this
year after lending surged and inflation accelerated.  “While tightening in China remains a big concern, losses
are being limited today by gains in other commodities such as
oil,” Zhang Hao, an analyst at Hengtai Futures Co., said from  Shanghai .  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s son called on protesters in
the country to engage in dialogue or face a civil war, while
Chinese authorities blocked foreign news reports on protests
across the country to stamp out any movement toward pro-
democracy revolts. Crude jumped 1.4 percent to $87.38 a barrel,
gold increased 0.4 percent and silver rose to a 31-year high.  Copper futures in  New York  gained as much as 0.4 percent to
$4.514 a pound and last traded at $4.51, erasing an earlier drop
of 0.7 percent. May delivery metal on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed for the first time in five days, by as much as
1.2 percent to 74,730 yuan ($11,375) a ton.  Copper in London climbed to a record $10,190 a ton on Feb.
15, extending last year’s 30 percent rally, on expectation that
demand may outpace supplies as the global economy recovers. The
world may be short of 435,000 tons of refined copper this year,
according to the International Copper Study Group.  China Tightens  The People’s Bank of China increased  interest rates  for the
third time in four months on Feb. 8, adding to last year’s
policy-tightening measures by the government that included
curbing loans for third-home purchases. Xinhua News Agency
reported on Feb. 19 that more cities including Shanghai and
Guangzhou announced restrictions on home purchases.  “The government is serious about keeping inflation in
check,” said Zhang Xuechuan, an analyst at Huachuang Securities
Co. “The tightening measures look set to continue.”  Aluminum in London rose as much as 0.4 percent to $2,578 a
ton, the highest level since September 2008, while nickel rose
as much as 0.9 percent to $29,400 a ton, the highest price since
April 2008. Zinc gained 1.3 percent to $2,586 a ton, lead was
little changed at $2,665 a ton, while tin rose 0.2 percent to
$32,400 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
