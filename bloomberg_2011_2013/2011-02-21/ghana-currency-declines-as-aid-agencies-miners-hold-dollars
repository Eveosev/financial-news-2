  Ghana ’s cedi weakened against the
dollar as aid agencies and mining companies supplied the market
with less of the foreign currency.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
traded at 1.5037 per dollar as of 2:05 p.m. in Accra, from
1.5005 at 9 a.m. this morning, according to data from the
Ghanaian unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd.  “We’ve not seen much on the side of dollar inflow,” said
Chris Nettey, a currency trader with Stanbic Bank Ghana Ltd., in
a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
