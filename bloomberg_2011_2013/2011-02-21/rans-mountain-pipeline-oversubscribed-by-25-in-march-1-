  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP 
said March shipment requests for its  Trans Mountain pipeline ,
which moves crude and refined products from Alberta to the
Canadian and U.S. west coasts, exceeded capacity by 25 percent.  Crude deliveries bound for refineries in British Columbia
and the state of  Washington  were oversubscribed by 45 percent,
the Houston-based company said in a bulletin to shippers.  The Trans Mountain mainline system is expected to carry
300,550 barrels a day in March, up 8.7 percent from estimated
February shipments of 276,402, according to the notices received
today and Jan. 24. The Puget Sound pipeline system will ship
174,400 barrels a day next month.  The 715-mile (1,150-kilometer) pipeline transports material
from  Edmonton , Alberta, to marketing terminals and refineries in
central British Columbia, the Vancouver area and the Puget Sound
region in Washington, according to the company’s website.  Products also are moved to  California , the U.S. Gulf Coast
and overseas through the Westridge marine terminal in Burnaby,
British Columbia.  Nominations for “advanced timing” shipments to the
Westridge dock were oversubscribed by 5 percent, and shipments
for regular timing were double the 44,988-barrel-a-day capacity,
according to the bulletin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
