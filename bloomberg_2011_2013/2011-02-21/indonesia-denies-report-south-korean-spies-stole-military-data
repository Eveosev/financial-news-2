The South Koreans who entered the
hotel room of Indonesian officials visiting  Seoul  didn’t steal
military data,  Indonesia ’s Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro
said, denying a report by the  Chosun Ilbo  newspaper.  The incident occurred on a different floor than the one
officials from the Indonesian Defense Ministry were staying,
Yusgiantoro told reporters in Jakarta today. An official from
the Indonesian Industry Ministry saw the South Koreans in his
room and a laptop that was taken from the room was returned,
Coordinating Minister for the Economy Hatta Rajasa said.  Chosun reported today South spies broke into the Lotte
Hotel room in Central Seoul on Feb. 16 to find out what price
Indonesia may bid for weapons and trainer jets. The report cited
an unidentified South Korean government official, and didn’t say
how the person knew the details of the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
