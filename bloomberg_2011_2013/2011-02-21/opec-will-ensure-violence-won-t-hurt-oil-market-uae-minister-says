OPEC will ensure that violence in
the Middle East and North Africa won’t disrupt the oil market,
the minister from the  United Arab Emirates  said.  “We want to make sure the market is not really very much
disturbed by what is going on,” Mohamed Al-Hamli, oil minister
from the U.A.E., said today as he arrived at the International
Energy Forum in Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia . “There is ample supply in
the market. We are watching what is going on, and we are ready
to put more oil on the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
