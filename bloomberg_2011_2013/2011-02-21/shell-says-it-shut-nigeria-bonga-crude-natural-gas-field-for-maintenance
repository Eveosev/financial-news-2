  Royal Dutch Shell Plc ’s Nigerian
unit said it shut its offshore Bonga oil field for maintenance.  “I can confirm there’s a maintenance shutdown for Bonga
this February,” Precious Okolobo, a company spokesman, said by
phone today from Abuja, the capital. “We can’t say for now when
it will end.”  The Bonga field, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) in the
Atlantic waters offshore Nigeria, has the capacity to pump more
than 200,000 barrels of crude and 150 million cubic feet of gas
a day, according to the company’s  website . It also supplies
natural gas to the Nigeria LNG Ltd.’s liquefaction plant on the
coastal Bonny Island that supplies long-term buyers in  Europe .  Nigeria is  Africa ’s top oil producer and the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. oil imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
