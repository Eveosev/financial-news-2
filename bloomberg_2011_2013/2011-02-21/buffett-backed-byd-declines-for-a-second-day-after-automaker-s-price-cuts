 BYD Co., the Chinese automaker
backed by  Warren Buffett , fell for a second day to the lowest in
19 months in Hong Kong trading after the automaker cut prices to
revive flagging sales.  BYD dropped as much as 7.2 percent and had declined 6.8
percent to HK$31.00, the lowest since July 8, 2009, as of the
12:30 p.m. trading break. The stock has lost 24 percent in 2011,
compared with a 2 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  BYD, China’s fastest-growing carmaker in 2009, is cutting
prices after its sales fell for six consecutive months through
January amid rising competition from overseas carmakers such as  General Motors Co . and  Volkswagen AG . The Shenzhen, Southern
China-based automaker cut prices of its F0, F3, F3R, G3 and F6
car models by 3,000 yuan ($457) to 15,000 yuan, BYD said in an
e-mailed statement on Feb. 18.  The company’s price cuts may “cannibalize the upcoming new
models’ sales and lead to deterioration in margins” this year,
Rebecca Tang and Don See, Hong Kong-based analysts at Standard
Chartered Plc., said in a report last week. Tang and See lowered
their 2011 earnings per share estimate for BYD by 58 percent to
1.25 yuan on the price cuts and profit erosion.  Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . paid HK$1.8 billion ($231
million) for a 10 percent stake in BYD in 2008. BYD sold 519,806
cars last year, 13 percent short of its target, which the
automaker had already cut by 25 percent in August.  Vehicle sales surged 32 percent in China to a record 18.06
million in 2010, helping the nation remain the world’s largest
auto market for a second year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
