Peruâ€™s navy destroyed 19 river-
dredging machines in the last two days as the government clamps
down on illegal gold mining in the southern Amazon jungle,
Defense Minister Jaime Thorne said today.  The dredges, some worth more than $500,000 and carrying up
to 500 grams of mercury, were blown up with dynamite, Thorne
said in an interview with Lima-based Radio Programas. Two people
were arrested, one Russian citizen and one Brazilian, as part of
the operation in the Madre de Dios rainforest, Thorne said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
