The commercial court in Zurich
rejected a law suit by  Nestle SA  and its Nespresso unit against
Swiss supermarket chain Denner AG and Alice Allison SA over
alleged patent violations, SDA reported, citing the court’s
written decision.  The judges decided that Denner’s sale of coffee capsules
that are compatible with Nespresso machines doesn’t violate
patent laws, according to the newswire. Denner commissioned
Alice Allison to produce the capsules which it sold at a lower
price than Nespresso capsules, SDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
