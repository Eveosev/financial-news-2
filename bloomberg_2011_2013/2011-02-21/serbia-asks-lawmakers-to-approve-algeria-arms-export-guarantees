  Serbia ’s government asked parliament
to approve a guarantee for arms exports to  Algeria  in a deal
that would exceed the country’s entire arms sales last year.  The 42-million-euro ($57 million) state guarantee will be
issued to Srpska Banka AD for deliveries that will go through
arms exporter Jugoimport SDPR.  The value of the export deal to Algeria is “around 288
million euros compared with $250 million in total arms exports
for the whole of 2010,” Finance Minister  Diana Dragutinovic 
told lawmakers in Belgrade today. In 2007, Serbia’s arms exports
stood at only $75 million.  Deputy Finance Minister Vuk Djokovic said it was important
for parliament to act quickly as “there are other competitors
who want to export to the Algerian market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
