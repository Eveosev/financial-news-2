Latvia’s credit market for consumers
and business may not expand this year, said Valdis Siksnis, head
of Nordea Bank AB’s Latvian unit, according to  Dienas Bizness .  “There will be more new deals, but in total, the credit
portfolio will not increase,” Siksnis told the Riga-based
newspaper in an interview. Pre-crisis lending was “too
liberal” and created a bubble, he told the newspaper.  Nordea would like to take 15 percent to 20 percent of the
Latvian market, Siksnis said, Dienas Bizness reported. According
to the Association of Latvian Commercial Banks, Nordea had a
market share of  13.4 percent  of the Latvian loan market in the
fourth quarter.  Nordea has bought a mortgage portfolio from Aizkraukles
Banka AS worth more than 4 million lati ($7.8 million), Siksnis
said, according to the newspaper.  -- Editor: James M. Gomez  To contact the reporter on this story:
