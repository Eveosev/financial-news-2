Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir
won’t run again for election in 2015, said Rabie Abdel Ati, a
senior member of the ruling  National Congress Party  and adviser
to the information minister.  “His decision not to run was not because of any pressure
or the circumstances in the other Arab countries,” Abdel Ati
said in a phone interview from Khartoum, the Sudanese capital.  Bashir came to power in a coup in 1989. He retained power
in Sudan’s first multiparty election in 24 years in April,
gaining 68 percent of the vote. Observers from the Atlanta-based  Carter Center  and the European Union said the elections failed
to meet international standards.  Anti-government protests across North  Africa  since January
ousted the presidents of Egypt and Tunisia, while similar
demonstrations have occurred in Algeria and Libya.  “Before last year’s elections, he had decided not to run,
but he did because of pressure from the party and the conditions
the country was facing,” Abdel Ati said.  South Sudan voted to secede from the north of the country
in a referendum in January. The region, which will become
independent in July, accounts for three quarters of Sudan’s
490,000 barrels of daily oil production.  Sudan  is sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-largest producer, according to the  BP Statistical
Review of World Energy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
