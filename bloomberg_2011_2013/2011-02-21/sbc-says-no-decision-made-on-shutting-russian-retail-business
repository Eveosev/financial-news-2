  HSBC Holdings Plc  said it “remains
committed” to its business in Russia, after the Kommersant
newspaper said Europe’s biggest bank may close its retail
operation in the country.  “No decision has been made to exit one of our businesses
in Russia,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank by market value, announced an
 investment of $200 million  in its Russia business in 2008. The
funding tripled HSBC Russia’s capital and “demonstrated” the
bank’s long-term commitment to the country, Russia Chief
Executive Officer Stuart Lawson said that year.  The bank has four branches in Moscow and one in  St.
Petersburg , and has been building a wealth management business
and a ruble bond trading operation.  Lawson left the bank in June last year and has since been
replaced by Huseyin Ozkaya, who had headed the bank’s corporate
and investment business in  Turkey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
