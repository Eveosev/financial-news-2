Formula One motor racing teams
agreed not to travel to Bahrain for test sessions beginning
March 3, Sky News reported, citing sources it didnâ€™t identify.  The season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix is scheduled for
March 13.  Doubt surrounds the event because of civil unrest that has
broken out in Bahrain and elsewhere as protesters call for
democratic reforms. Arab governments are cracking down on
activists as uprisings that toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt
spread to Bahrain, Libya, Algeria and elsewhere.  Yesterday, Formula One chief  Bernie Ecclestone  said the
Crown Prince of Bahrain, Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, will
decide whether the Grand Prix goes ahead.  The race could be rescheduled for later in the season,
Ecclestone said. The schedule would then start with the
Australian Grand Prix in  Melbourne  on March 27.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
