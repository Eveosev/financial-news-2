  Air France-KLM  and Delta Air Lines
Inc. hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . to assist them in a possible
joint bid for Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd, the Telegraph said,
without attribution.  Richard Branson, whose 51 percent share in Virgin Atlantic
has been valued by analysts at between 500 million pounds
($811.10 million) and 1 billion pounds, appointed Deutsche Bank
AG to study future business options, the newspaper said, without
saying where it got the information.  Etihad Airways may have written to Deutsche Bank expressing
interest in a bid, and have hired Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
as advisers, the Telegraph reported.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. hold 49 percent, after paying 600
million pounds in 1999, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
