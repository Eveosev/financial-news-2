Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts rose after economists raised their inflation
forecasts, fueling speculation that policy makers will raise
borrowing costs more than previously predicted to rein in price
increases.  The yield on the contract due in January 2013, the most
traded in  Sao Paulo  today, advanced 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 12.73 percent at 7:17 a.m. New York time.  Consumer prices will rise 5.79 percent this year, compared
with forecast of 5.75 percent a week earlier, according to the
median forecast in a weekly central bank survey of about 100
economists published today. Inflation will end 2012 at 4.78
percent, the survey showed, compared with a week-earlier
prediction of 4.7 percent. The central bank targets inflation of
4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  “There’s a lot of uncertainty on inflation,” said Marcelo Fonseca, who helps manage $1.4 billion as an economist at M.
Safra & Co. in Sao Paulo. “Companies are suffering a cost
shock, and not just from food prices, as there’s also pressure
from steel products and metals.”  The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.6652 per dollar, from
1.6621 on Feb. 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
