The  International Energy Agency ’s
member governments hold enough crude oil to provide 4 million
barrels a day from inventories to the market for a year, said
David Fyfe, head of the IEA’s oil industry and markets unit.  Crude stockpiles held by governments of the group’s 28
member countries are about 1.6 billion barrels, Fyfe said at the
International Petroleum Week conference in  London  today.  “Our organization is on fairly high alert, as it always
is,” he said. “We’re in a state of constant readiness.”  Brent crude rose to more than $100 a barrel last month as
the ouster of Tunisia’s president and protests in  Egypt  that led
to the fall of President  Hosni Mubarak  sparked concern that
unrest may disrupt supplies from the Middle East. Libya, the
eighth-largest oil producer among those with quotas in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has become the
focal point of region-wide protests.  OPEC is pursuing a “sensible” policy of gradual supply
growth, Fyfe said today. A sustained price of $95 a barrel would
be a burden on the economy, he said, adding that the market is
“relatively well-supplied” with stockpiles at a
“comfortable” level and demand growth slowing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
