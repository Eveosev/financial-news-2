European stocks fluctuated after a
three-week rally left the Stoxx Europe 600 Index close to its
highest level since August 2008. U.S. futures were little
changed and Asian shares retreated.  Carlsberg A/S fell 1.6 percent after the Nordic region’s
biggest brewer reported net income for the fourth quarter that
missed analysts’ estimates.  Eni SpA  sank 2.8 percent amid
speculation that revolts in Libya will hinder the company’s
operations in the North African country.  Merck KGaA  advanced 3.6
percent after fourth-quarter earnings beat estimates.  The Stoxx 600 fell 0.1 percent to 290.87 at 9:04 a.m. in
London after earlier retreating as much as 0.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
