U.S. Vice Admiral Scott R. Van
Buskirk, commander of the Seventh Fleet, said any suggestions
that domestic economic problems and the war in  Afghanistan  were
weakening the nation’s military commitment in  Asia  are wrong.  “The ships and aircraft that we operate today are vastly
more capable than they were just a few years ago,” he told a
meeting of the Asia Society in  Hong Kong  today. “That fact
seems to be lost on some,” he said, adding that “our
commitment remains steadfast.”  The deployment of the nuclear powered  USS George Washington 
to Japan puts the Navy 15 days closer to any potential hotspot
in the region, and the carrier has almost unlimited range and 50
percent more storage space for ammunition than its predecessor,
he said. New submarines give commanders the ability to carry out
shallow-water missions such as espionage and special-forces
support for clandestine operations on shore, he said.  Van Buskirk’s comments follow a year in which two North
Korean attacks against  South Korea  heightened tensions in the
region, while  China  developed stealth fighter technology and
ballistic missiles that may be capable of hitting a maneuvering
aircraft carrier at sea.  China is not a direct threat to the U.S., Van Buskirk said.
The growth of the People’s Liberation Army navy was to be
welcomed so long as the forces were deployed “in a way that is
responsible and constructive,” he said.  China’s role in anti-piracy operations was a good
opportunity to build day-to-day communications that could help
prevent misunderstandings at sea, Van Buskirk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
