  Kenya ’s shilling slumped to the
weakest level in seven months against the dollar as demand for
the U.S. currency by the nation’s oil importers rose after crude
climbed the most in three weeks on tension in the Middle East.  The currency of East  Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.5 percent to 82.19 per dollar, the lowest intraday
level since July 22, and traded 0.1 percent weaker at 81.80 at
3:55 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  “The shilling has weakened due to high demand for dollars
by the oil importers who are concerned over the ongoing unrest
in the Arab world, the main source of Kenya imports,” John
Muli, a dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a
phone interview today.  The political unrest that started in Tunisia and  Egypt  has
spread to Bahrain and Libya, the holder of Africa’s biggest
crude reserves, and is threatening to engulf other Middle East
countries, stoking concern shipments from the region may be
disrupted. Crude for April delivery surged as much as 4.5
percent to $93.75 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
