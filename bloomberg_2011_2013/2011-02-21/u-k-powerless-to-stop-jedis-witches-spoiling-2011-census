People who want to declare their
religion as Jedi or call themselves witches will be free to do
so in the 2011 census in England and  Wales , its organizer said.  Office for National Statistics Census Director Glen Watson
said that while it is “not acceptable” to submit joke answers,
he is powerless to act. In the last census in 2001, 400,000
people claimed they were part of the Star Wars movement, some of
them putting the answer as a protest against privacy invasion.  “The religion question is the only voluntary question on
the whole questionnaire,” Watson told reporters in London today
at the launch of the 482-million-pound ($782 million) project.
“We would process the information and we would include that in
the results, I imagine. I don’t think we would pursue somebody
for declaring their religion, for example, as Jedi.”  The census aims to give an accurate snapshot of life in
Britain and will focus more on how people view their identity
and language ability as a result of an increase in immigration
in the last decade.  Changing lifestyles and home use will also be tracked, with
the section on rooms now including a category to list
conservatories and studies. About 26 million forms will be sent
out to households in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
