Foodcorp Ltd., the South African
maker of Nola mayonnaise and Ouma rusks, plans to sell 415
million euros ($567.4 million) of seven-year notes to refinance
existing debt.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Barclays Capital  are arranging the
sale and meetings will be held with European investors from
tomorrow through Feb. 25, the Johannesburg-based company said in
a statement today. North Sea Partners LLC is acting as a
financial advisor to Foodcorp.  The company has 272.9 million euros of outstanding bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its 8.875 percent debt
due June 2012 yielded 7.53 percent at 1:08 p.m. in Johannesburg.  “We hope to get less than the 8.875 percent we got in the
bonds sold in 2008,” Chief Financial Officer Ockert Janse van
Rensburg said in a telephone interview from  London  today.  Foodcorp said it will also use proceeds to settle existing
hedging arrangements and fund repurchases or redemptions of
securities issued by its parent company, New Foodcorp Holdings
(Pty) Ltd.  Foodcorp is rated B- by  Standard & Poor’s , six steps below
investment grade. The company is 44.44 percent owned by BlueBay
Asset Management Plc, a London-based  fund manager , which bought
the stake for 495.51 million rand ($69 million) in March.  The company raised 135 million euros in 2007, which it used
to acquire First Lifestyle, a food producer whose brands include
Pieman’s Pantry, Gull Foods and Fifers Bakery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
