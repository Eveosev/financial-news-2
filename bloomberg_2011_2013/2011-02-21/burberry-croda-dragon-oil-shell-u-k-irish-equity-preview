U.K. stocks posted the biggest two-
day slump in a month, as concern mounted that unrest in Libya
will push oil prices higher, curbing economic growth.    Randgold Resources Ltd .,  BG Group Plc  and  Antofagasta Plc 
led raw-material companies lower on the benchmark  FTSE 100
Index . HSBC Holdings Plc dropped 1.6 percent and  Barclays Plc 
fell 1.1 percent, leading a retreat among bank shares. BAE
Systems Plc plunged 5.1 percent.  The FTSE 100 lost 59.44, or 1 percent, to 5,955.36 at 12:12
p.m. in London, as nine companies fell for every one that rose.
The two-day slump has cut this year’s gains to 1 percent amid
concern that political instability in the Middle East will
weaken the economic recovery and hurt corporate earnings. The  FTSE All-Share Index  also declined 1 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped 0.4 percent.  “The current regime in  Libya  has had a much more violent
reaction to protesters than its neighbors and we are concerned
the crisis may worsen,” said Ana Armstrong, chairman of
Distinction Asset Management which has about 180 million pounds
($291 million) in client funds. “Price rises may choke off
anaemic growth in the West which in turn will put pressures on
governments and central banks to further stoke inflationary
fires through the printing of more money and extended zero
interest rate policies.”  Oil rose to the highest price since September 2008 as
soldiers deserted Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi’s government and
the country’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations accused
his government of “genocide.” Planes and helicopters fired on
protesters, and eyewitnesses reported massacres in two
neighborhoods of Tripoli, Al Arabiya TV said. Libya holds
Africa’s largest oil reserves.  Randgold, Antofagasta  Randgold Resources, a producer of the precious metal in
West Africa, sank 1.3 percent to 5,165 pence. BG slid 1.3
percent to 1,438 pence, while Antofagasta declined 1.4 percent
to 1,371 pence.  HSBC lost 1.6 percent to 693.5 pence. Barclays retreated

percent to 65.9 pence.  BAE Systems plunged 5.5 percent to 322.6 pence.    Croda International Plc  jumped 7.4 percent to 1,605 pence.
The U.K. supplier of sun-block agents to Procter & Gamble Co.
reported fourth-quarter operating profit of 49.4 million pounds
($79.8 million). Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had predicted
earnings before interest and taxes of 43 million pounds.  Dragon Oil Plc rallied 3.1 percent to 576 pence. The
London-listed explorer focused on projects in Turkmenistan
posted a 49 percent jump in full-year profit to $386.1 million
and said it will pay a debut dividend.    Kerry Group Plc  advanced 3.7 percent to 26.35 euros.
Ireland’s largest food company said full-year net income climbed
to 324.2 million euros ($443.4 million) from 201.2 million euros
a year earlier. The company said 2011 earnings may climb as much
as 12 percent as it considers making further acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
