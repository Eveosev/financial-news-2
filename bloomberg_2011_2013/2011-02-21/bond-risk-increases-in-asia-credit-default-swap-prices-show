The cost of protecting corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment rose in Asia outside of Japan,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan advanced 1 basis point to 107 basis
points as of 8:26 a.m. in  Singapore , according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 101.5
basis points as of 9:28 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Citigroup
Inc. The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 104.5 basis points as of 11:25 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac
Banking Corp. prices show.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
debt against default and traders use them to speculate on  credit
quality . An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement.  The swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
