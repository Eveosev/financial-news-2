Oil market supply and demand is
balanced and inventories are ample,  Saudi Arabia ’s second most
senior energy official told reporters before an international
forum aimed at reducing price volatility.  “We have a well-balanced market today and oil stocks at a
very comfortable level,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the
country’s Assistant Minister for Petroleum Affairs, told
reporters at a press conference in  Riyadh . “There is an
abundant amount of oil in the market.”  Saudi Arabia, the region’s biggest oil exporter, is hosting
the  International Energy Forum  in Riyadh tomorrow, where
officials from more than 90 nations including U.S. Deputy Energy
Secretary Daniel Poneman will gather to endorse a charter aimed
at improving energy market data and reducing price fluctuations.  “I expect once the charter is approved we will see the
number of countries reach 93,” the prince said, adding that the
meeting will address the issue of price volatility, not set any
absolute level for prices, he added. So far, 87 countries have
agreed to the charter, he said.  The forum will include ministers from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, which supplies 40 percent of the
world’s oil, and the  International Energy Agency , an adviser to
28 consuming nations.    Oil prices  have soared this month as political unrest
spread across North Africa and parts of the Middle East. Asked
about the latest violence in  Libya , the Saudi prince said: “We
wish to see things there back to normal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
