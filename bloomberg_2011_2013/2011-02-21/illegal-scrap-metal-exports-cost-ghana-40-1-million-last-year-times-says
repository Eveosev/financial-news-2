Illegal exports of scrap metal from  Ghana  totaled 60 million cedis ($40.1 million) last year,
depriving the West African nation’s four steelmakers of their
main source of raw material, the  Business & Financial Times 
said.  As many as 5,000 shipping containers of used metal left the
country last year labeled as shea nuts, cashews, teak wood or
other products, the Accra-based newspaper said, citing Mark
Tchorly, chief collector in charge of exports at Ghana’s Tema
port. Ghana banned scrap metal exports in 2004, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jason McLure in Accra on
