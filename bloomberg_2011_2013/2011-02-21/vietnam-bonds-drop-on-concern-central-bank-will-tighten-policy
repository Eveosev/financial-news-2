Vietnamese bonds fell the most in
almost two weeks on speculation the government will tighten
monetary policy further to curb inflation. The dong gained for a
second straight day.    Vietnam  will raise average electricity prices by 15.3
percent starting March 1, raising concern price gains will
accelerate. Consumer prices increased 12.17 percent in January
from a year earlier, the fastest pace since February 2009. The
central bank lifted the refinancing rate on Feb. 17 to 11
percent from 9 percent.  “I think bond yields will rise because people are
expecting that monetary policy will be tightened further,” said
Dam Trung Kien, a Hanoi-based trader at Bao Viet Fund Management
Co., a unit of Vietnam’s biggest insurer. “The confirmed power-
price increase will not only boost household expenses but also
push up input costs in the economy.”  The yield on five-year bonds rose seven basis points, the
most since Feb. 8, to 11.53 percent, as of 3:40 p.m. in Hanoi,
according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has approved lowering this
year’s credit-growth target to 20 percent from 23 percent,
online newswire VnExpress reported today, citing central bank
Governor Nguyen Van Giau.  The dong rose 0.2 percent to 20,835 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It traded between 22,100 and
22,230 at money changers in  Ho Chi Minh City , compared with
between 22,030 and 22,120 on Feb. 18, according to a telephone-
directory information service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts &
Telecommunications.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,673, compared
with 20,678 on Feb. 18. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1
percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
