INA Industrija Nafte d.d., the
Croatian  oil company  controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt., is in
the process of evacuating employees of its drilling unit  Crosco
d.d.  out of Libya because of civil unrest.  Crosco has 77 workers in various locations in Libya, the
refiner said in a statement today.  “At the moment we are making arrangements to evacuate all
the employees as soon as possible,” the Zagreb-based company
said.  Mol holds a 47.26 percent stake in INA Industrija nafte
d.d., while the Croatian government owns 44.84 percent of the
country’s largest refiner.  In addition to 11 exploration and production plants in
continental Croatia and 19 off-shore platforms in the northern
Adriatic that are jointly owned with  Italy ’s ENI SpA and Edison
SpA,  INA  has upstream facilities in Syria, Egypt and Angola.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jasmina Kuzmanovic at
