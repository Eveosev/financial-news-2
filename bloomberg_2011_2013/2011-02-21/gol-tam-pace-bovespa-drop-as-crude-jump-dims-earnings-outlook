  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA 
and  Tam SA , Brazil’s biggest airlines, tumbled in Sao Paulo
trading on concern rising oil prices will increase costs and
hurt profit.  Gol fell 3.7 percent to 22.16 reais, while Tam slipped 3.1
percent to 35.30 reais at the 4:15 p.m. New York time close. The
declines were the biggest since Feb. 9 for both companies. The
benchmark Bovespa index dropped 1.2 percent.  The carriers’ shares have underperformed this year, with
Gol down 8.4 percent through last week, compared with a drop of
6.5 percent for Tam and 1.8 percent for the Bovespa. Oil surged
today to the highest price in more than two years in London as
violence escalated in  Libya , stoking concern supplies will be
disrupted as turmoil spreads through the region.  “This is an important cost for these companies,” said
Rosangela Ribeiro, an analyst at SLW Corretora brokerage in Sao
Paulo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
