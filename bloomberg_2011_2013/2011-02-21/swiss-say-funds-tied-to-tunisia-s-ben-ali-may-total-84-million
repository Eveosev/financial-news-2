Swiss assets linked to former
Tunisian President Zine al-Abedine Ben Ali may total as much as
80 million francs ($84 million), the Federal Police Office said.  Ben Ali, 74, who fled to  Saudi Arabia  on Jan. 14 following
weeks of unrest over unemployment, corruption and repression,
was the first Arab leader to be forced out by popular unrest
since at least 1985.  Switzerland  froze assets belonging to him
and his immediate circle five days later “to prevent any
possible misuse.”  “Based on about 30 reports of suspicious activity in
connection with  money laundering  with relation to Tunisia, there
is about 80 million Swiss francs,” Stefan Kunfermann, a
spokesman for the federal police in Bern, said by phone today.  Under Swiss law, the Money Laundering Reporting Office
Switzerland is responsible for receiving and analyzing
suspicious-activity reports in connection with money laundering
and, if necessary, forwarding them to law enforcement agencies,
Kunfermann said.  The Swiss government has faced international pressure to
change the country’s banking regulations on revelations that
financial institutions had accepted money from former dictators
such as  Nigeria ’s Sani Abacha and Haiti’s Jean-Claude Duvalier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
