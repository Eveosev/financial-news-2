  Indonesia  has ordered state-owned
utility PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara to buy power from the
country’s geothermal plants to support investment in the
alternative energy source.  Jakarta-based Listrik Negara is required to buy geothermal
power at a maximum of 9.7 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour from new
plants, according to a ministerial  decree  effective on Feb. 16
and obtained by Bloomberg News today.  For  power plants  built before the ruling, Listrik will buy
electricity based on prices agreed by the government and the  utility companies  when they signed development rights.  “The decree will give a legal platform for accelerating
geothermal development and in completing power purchase
agreements,” Surya Darma, head of the Indonesian Geothermal
Association, said by phone from Jakarta today.  Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, is encouraging
the use of cleaner energy to accelerate electrification in
remote areas and meet President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s
targeted average annual growth rate of 6.6 percent over the
remainder of his second term, which ends in July 2014.  A geothermal venture of  Chevron Corp .’s Indonesian unit was
awarded a permit from the West Lampung regency to explore and
develop 320 square kilometers of land on the southern part of
Sumatra island, Chevron said Dec. 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
