  BAE Systems Plc , the U.K. partner
building the Eurofighter, is in talks with both Qatar and Oman
over the sale of combat jets.  Kuwait and  India  also have a requirement for such planes,
said Simon Keith, managing director for BAE in the Middle East,
Africa and  Asia  Pacific regions.  The Middle East and Asia are increasingly important markets
for European weapons makers as governments at home rein in
purchases to combat budget deficits. U.K. Prime Minister David
Cameron said on Oct. 19 that the country’s armed forces will be
cut and military expenditure slashed by 8 percent, adjusted for
inflation, over four years.  “The Middle East is a key export area and we reckon
opportunities will continue to arise because the industrial
infrastructure in those countries doesn’t enable them to build
entire military equipment,” Keith said in an interview at a
military trade show today in  Abu Dhabi , in the United Arab
Emirates.  Keith said there has been steady growth in demand from that
region for equipment, with the biggest growth in gear for cyber
security and border protection.  The executive said  Saudi Arabia  has taken delivery of 18
out of 72 Typhoons, the export name for the Eurofighter. The
nation placed a 4.4 billion-pound ($7 billion) order and has
options for additional planes.  “I know it’s very high on their agenda to think about
getting some more,” Keith said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
