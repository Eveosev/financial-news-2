Serbia’s state-run Health Insurance
fund negotiated a 10 percent writedown of its more than 14
billion dinars ($186 million) debt to drugmakers and pledge to
speed up payment for delivery,  Tanjug  newswire reported, citing
the fund’s general manager, Aleksandar Vuksanovic.  Serbian pharmaceuticals makers  Galenika  and  Jugoremedija ,
local units of Actavis Group hf and  PharmaSwiss SA  agreed to
cancel part of their claims and reduce some prices for new
deliveries. A similar deal is expected with  Hemofarn AD , a
subsidiary of  Germany ’s  Stada Arzneimittel AG ., according to the
report.  For its part, the fund that supplies Serbia’s vast network
of state-run clinics and hospitals is to pay for the drugs
within four months upon delivery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
