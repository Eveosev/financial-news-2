DTEK, Ukraine’s largest non-state
coal and power producer, reduced electricity supplies to  central
Europe  after a fire broke out on a transformer.  “In the morning we were informed of a fire on a state-
owned transformer station in Burshtyn” on Ukraine’s western
border, Andrey Favorov, chief executive officer of DTEK’s
energy-exports unit, said today by telephone. “That led to the
limitation of supply of electricity to our customers from 490
megawatts a month to 50 megawatts.”  DTEK supplies electricity to Hungary and Slovakia, which
then sell it to Germany and the  Czech Republic .  It will take as long as three weeks to repair the damaged
transformer, Favorov said, without saying what caused the fire.
DTEK won’t declare force majeure because it can buy power in  Germany  to supply customers, he said, adding that it will have
to pay 15 percent more for German power than it pays in Ukraine.  Force majeure is a legal clause that allows companies to
miss contracted deliveries because of circumstances beyond their
control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
