Ukraine’s economy will expand at a
faster pace this year as domestic consumption overtakes exports
as the key growth driver, “putting the recovery on firmer
ground,” BG Capital said.  Ukraine’s gross domestic product may grow 4.8 percent 2011,
compared with an increase of 4.2 percent a year earlier, Vitaliy Vavryshchuk, an economist at Kiev-based BG Capital investment
bank, wrote in an e-mailed research note today.  The Eastern European nation returned to growth last year
after posting a 14.8 percent decline in 2009 as the global
financial crisis eroded demand for Ukraine’s commodity exports
and its currency slumped. The economy expanded 6 percent in
January, the central bank said last week.  “Ukraine entered 2011 on a positive note,” Vavryshchuk
wrote. “Robust economic growth continues unabated, backed both
by a favorable external environmental and a pick-up in domestic
demand.”  The hryvnia will remain stable and trade between 7.92 to
7.97 per dollar in the first half, strengthening to 7.85 against
the greenback by the end of the year, Vavryshchuk said.  Ukraine’s currency was little changed today, trading at
7.9550 per dollar as of 6 p.m. in Kiev, compared with 7.9555 on
Feb. 18.  Currency “stability and slowing inflation show that most
fundamentals are in place for economic growth to further gain
momentum through 2011,” BG Capital said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
