The forint maintained its decline
versus the euro after  Hungary ’s central bank left its main
interest rate unchanged, as expected by analysts, following
three months of increases.  The Hungarian currency weakened 0.3 percent to 270.85 as of
2:26 p.m. in Budapest. The benchmark BUX Index of shares rose
0.2 percent to 22,553.17. The government bond maturing in 2020
slumped, pushing its yield 5 basis points higher to 7.548
percent.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank left its two-week deposit rate at 6
percent after raising it by 0.75 percentage point starting in
November. The decision matched the forecast of all 23 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. Central bank President Andras Simor will
explain the decision to reporters at 3 p.m. in Budapest.  “We expect at most another 25 basis-point rate increase
this year,” analysts at Equilor Befektetesi Zrt. led by Akos Kuti in Budapest wrote in a note after the rate decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
