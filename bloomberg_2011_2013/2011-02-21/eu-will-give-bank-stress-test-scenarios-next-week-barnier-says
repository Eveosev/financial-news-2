  Michel Barnier , the European Union’s
financial services commissioner, said the distress scenarios for
this year’s bank stress tests will be announced March 2.  “We will be officially announcing the methodology,”
Barnier said in a speech in Brussels today.  Last year’s European Union stress tests were criticized for
not being stringent enough because lenders in the 27-nation
region were deemed by regulators to need only 3.5 billion euros
($4.8 billion) of new capital, about a 10th of the lowest
analyst estimate.  “There are very complex issues if the tests are to be
credible and represent progress in 2011, compared to those done
in 2010,” Barnier said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
