The  Suez Canal  Authority hasn’t
received a schedule for the passage of two Iranian warships
through the waterway, said Ahmed El Manakhly, head of traffic at
the canal.  “We can’t say when the ships will pass,” he said in a
telephone interview. “We can’t say if the ships will pass today
or tomorrow. The Iranians haven’t informed us of when they will
pass.”  The Associated Press reported that the two naval vessels
are expected to start their passage through the canal tomorrow,
paying a fee of $290,000. Egypt said on Feb. 18 that it had
approved Iran’s request to send the ships through the canal on
their way to Syria.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said  Israel  views with
“gravity” Iran’s plan to send the vessels through the
waterway, a move that he said highlights the need to increase
his country’s defense budget.  The 120-mile (190-kilometer) Suez Canal carries about 2.5
percent of world oil output, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., and is a key route for ships carrying Asian  consumer goods 
to  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
