AC Milan captain Gennaro Gattuso was
banned for four European matches after he “assaulted” 59-year-
old Tottenham coach Joe  Jordan , the continent’s soccer governing
body UEFA said today.  Gattuso, 33, clashed with Jordan during the second half of
last week’s round-of-16 Champions League match at the San Siro
stadium before pushing his forehead into the coach’s face after
the game.  “The control and disciplinary body ruled that Gattuso had
assaulted the Tottenham Hotspur assistant coach Joe Jordan after
the match,” UEFA said on its  website  today.  Spurs won 1-0 through  Peter Crouch ’s 80th-minute goal.
Gattuso is already suspended from the March 9 return game after
collecting a yellow card in the second half. His ban will start
after that match, UEFA said.  Gattuso has three days to appeal the decision.  The midfielder, who at one time played for  Scotland ’s
Rangers, put his hands round Jordan’s throat when the pair first
clashed during a break for injury. Then after the match Gattuso,
a World Cup winner with Italy, sought out bespectacled Jordan
again. He went face to face with the former AC Milan striker
before headbutting him.  “I was nervous. We were both speaking Scottish, something
that I learned when I played in his home city of Glasgow, but I
can’t tell you what we said,” Gattuso said after the match. “I
didn’t want to argue with players and I did it with him but I
was wrong to do what I have done. I will have to await what they
decide.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
