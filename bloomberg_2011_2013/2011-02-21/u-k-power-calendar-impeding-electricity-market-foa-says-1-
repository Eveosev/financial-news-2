U.K. power contracts, set on a
calendar that isn’t synchronized with related fuels, are a
barrier to growth in the market, according to the Futures and
Options Association.  Most monthly electricity contracts are traded in over-the-
counter deals under the so-called  EFA  calendar, or electricity
forward arrangements. This can make it difficult for traders to
arbitrage U.K power contracts with other fuel and European power
products.  These power contracts are “discouraging spread trading”
and make it “overly complicated” to trade against gas and
continental European power products, according to traders
surveyed for the FOA’s power-trading committee after the subject
was considered in November. The results of the survey were sent
by e-mail.  The EFA calendar is “archaic” and “difficult to
understand,” the e-mail said. Almost 77 percent would rather
use contracts that follow the regular calendar. Trading systems
would need to be upgraded to deal with any changes, and 54
percent of respondents cited apathy as a barrier to switching.
The FOA’s power committee will assess the practicalities of
switching, the e-mail said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
