Swedish financial services companies
are ignoring European Union guidelines on awarding bonuses, the
country’s financial regulator said.  Most of the 41 companies surveyed failed to comply with
guidelines effective since Jan. 1 last year requiring them to
adopt EU recommendations, the Swedish Financial Supervisory
Authority said in a statement published today on its website.  The  FSA  will now start individual investigations into each
of the companies that “displayed shortcomings,” it said.  “The authority needs to implement further measures, if
needed, to make sure bonuses in the financial sector don’t act
as a driving force for greed and increased risk-taking,”
Financial Markets Minister Peter Norman said in a separate
statement published today on the government’s website.  The FSA will publish clearer rules on March 1 in an effort
to prevent financial companies from finding loopholes, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
