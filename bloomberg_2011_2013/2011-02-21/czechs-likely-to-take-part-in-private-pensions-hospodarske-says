As many as 60 percent of eligible
Czechs may take part in a private pension system the government
plans to introduce within the next two years,  Hospodarske Noviny 
reported, citing Social Affairs Minister Jaromir Drabek.  The cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Necas wants to
strengthen private savings for retirement by allowing people to
divert part of their compulsory pension payments to their
personal accounts from the state-run pay-as-you-go program, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
