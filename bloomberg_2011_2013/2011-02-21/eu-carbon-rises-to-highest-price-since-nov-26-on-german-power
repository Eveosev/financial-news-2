European Union carbon allowances
rose to their highest price since Nov. 26, tracking increases
for German power, coal and oil.  EU carbon permits for December increased 1.8 percent to
close at 15.26 euros ($20.86) a metric ton on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London. German power for next year rose 1.6
percent to 53.60 euros a megawatt hour, according to broker
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Carbon prices extended gains after  Barclays Plc  said the
EU’s option of setting aside as many as 800 million surplus
carbon allowances may add 10 euros a ton to prices in 2013. The
EU market, with benchmark emission prices are up 15 percent from
a year ago, has an oversupply of about 460 million allowances
for the five years through 2012, analysts led by  Trevor Sikorski 
at the Barclays Capital investment bank in London said today in
an e-mailed note.  Power utilities will need much of that extra supply to
hedge their forward sales of electricity over the next few
years, they said. Removing some permits and setting them aside
as suggested in an EU planning document would probably mean a
“tight market, greater price volatility and an almighty
scramble for allowances,” Sikorski said.  The bank forecast on Feb. 14 that EU prices will be 30
euros a metric ton in 2013. A 10 euro jump would represent a
surge of 33 percent.    Brent crude  for April settlement climbed 3.6 percent to
$106.02 a barrel on ICE, the highest since 2008, as violence
escalated in  Libya , stoking supply concern.  Carbon allowances may rise to 15.68 euros a ton this week
as open interest in the December contract will probably
increase, according to Brett Genus of OTC Europe LLP.  Relative Strength  The carbon market is showing momentum, Genus said today by
phone. Today’s close above 15 euros was the first this year
after retreating from that level six times in 2011’s intraday
trade. The volume of December futures traded today on ICE jumped
69 percent compared with Feb. 18 to 14 million tons, the highest
level since Feb. 3.  Genus cited a weekly relative-strength index, which was at
67 today, compared with 39 at the end of last year.  The index, a gauge of price momentum, measures the
magnitude of a commodity’s price gains relative to declines over
a period of time. The readings oscillate on a scale between 0
and 100. A reading between 70 and 80 indicates a commodity may
be overbought and is likely to fall. Readings from 30 to 20
indicate oversold conditions and the likelihood of price gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
