Foreign tourism may fall as much as
88 percent in Acapulco this year as spring breakers cancel trips
because of reports of violence, El Universal reported.  Hotels in Acapulco, Mazatlan and Puerto Penasco are seeing
a smaller-than-normal influx of college-age revelers after the
U.S. advised citizens to avoid unnecessary travel to 18 Mexican
states, the  Mexico  City-based newspaper reported, citing
Guerrero Stateâ€™s tourism ministry and travel agency StudentCity.  Violence in Mexico has increased since President Felipe Calderon started sending military troops to fight drug gangs.
Drug-related deaths rose to 15,273 last year from 9,612 in 2009,
according to government figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
