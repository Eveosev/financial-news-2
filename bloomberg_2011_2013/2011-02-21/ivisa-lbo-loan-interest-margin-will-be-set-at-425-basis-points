Mivisa Group will cut the interest
margin on some of the 667.5 million euros ($913 million) of
leveraged loans it’s raising to 425 basis points, the second
time the price of the debt has been lowered, according to a
person involved in the deal.  Strong demand from lenders allowed Murcia, Spain-based
Mivisa to reduce the interest margin on the 472.5 million-euro
seven-year  term loan  targeting non-bank lenders from 500 basis
points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The amount of financing for the takeover of the can maker
by firms led by  Blackstone Group LP  has increased by 32.5
million euros to 667.5 million euros. The latest reverse flex in
pricing follows a 25 basis-point reduction on Feb. 8. Reverse
flexes are when loan terms change during a deal’s marketing to
benefit the borrower.    Barclays Capital , Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Morgan Stanley are arranging the debt, according to
Bloomberg data. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Helen Winning, a spokeswoman for Blackstone in London,
didn’t returned an e-mail and a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
