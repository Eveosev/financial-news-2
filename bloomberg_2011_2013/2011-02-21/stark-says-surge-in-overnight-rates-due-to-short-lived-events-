(Corrects story published yesterday to say surge in
borrowing in first and second paragraphs.)  European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said a surge in overnight borrowing
was due to “special factors” mainly in Ireland.  “It was a very short lived event mainly due to
developments in Ireland,” Stark told reporters at an event in  Frankfurt  today without elaborating. Asked whether he considers
rising overnight borrowing a sign of re-emerging market
tensions, he said “I don’t think so.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
