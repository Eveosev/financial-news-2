Growth in  Europe ’s services and
manufacturing industries accelerated to the fastest pace in more
than four years in February.  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in the 17-nation euro region in both industries rose to
58.4 from 57 in January, London-based Markit Economics said in
an initial estimate today. That was the highest since July 2006
and above the 56.9 forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.  “Growth has accelerated sharply since hitting a low last
October, with manufacturing continuing to lead the renewed
upturn in February as production rose at a pace only marginally
below the 10-year peak seen in April of last year,” Markit said
in a statement.  The euro-area economy is gaining strength after expanding
less than economists forecast in the fourth quarter. With
companies stepping up output and hiring to meet export demand,
consumers are growing more optimistic even as governments
toughen budget cuts.  PPR  SA, the French owner of Gucci, on Feb.
17 forecast “robust revenue growth” in 2011.    Germany , Europe’s largest economy, has powered the region’s
expansion as countries from  Spain  to Ireland stepped up spending
cuts to plug budget deficits. German investor confidence rose
for a fourth month in February and unemployment dropped to the
lowest in almost two decades last month. In  France , business
confidence increased more than economists forecast last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
