New York spent $1.4 billion on
Medicaid payments for unnecessary hospital admissions that could
have been treated by family doctors, the  New York  Post reported,
citing health-care industry insiders.  In  New York City , the state Health Department said 26
percent of Medicaid hospital admissions werenâ€™t necessary or
could have been prevented, the newspaper reported.   New York spends $50 billion on Medicaid programs, an amount
Governor  Andrew Cuomo  is trying to curb, the Post said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
