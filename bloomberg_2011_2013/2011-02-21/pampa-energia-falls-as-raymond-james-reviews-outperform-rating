  Pampa Energia SA ,  Argentina ’s
largest electricity holding company, fell the most in more than
a week after  Raymond James  & Associates Inc. put its
“outperform” rating on review.  Pampa fell 1.8 percent to 2.67 pesos at 2:57 p.m. New York
time, the biggest slide since Feb. 10.  Raymond James placed the rating and its year-end price
estimate of $14 per American depositary receipt on review,
according to an e-mailed note to clients, without indicating if
the review would result in an increase or a decrease.  Pampa announced Feb. 18 a technical fault at a steam
turbine unit of the planned expansion at its Central Termica
Loma de la Lata SA thermoelectric plant. Pampa said Jan. 19 that
it agreed to buy three distribution companies and a 50 percent
stake in the holding company that controls natural gas
transporter Transportadora de Gas del Sur SA from Ashmore Energy
International Ltd.  “We are placing the company under review to update our
model and valuation based on the recent acquisitions announced
as well as the technical issue,” analysts including Diego Trucco wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
