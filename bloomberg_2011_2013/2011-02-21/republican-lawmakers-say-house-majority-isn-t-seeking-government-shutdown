Representative  Paul Ryan , chairman
of the House Budget Committee, said Republicans aren’t seeking
to force a government shutdown and would negotiate a stop-gap
spending plan that includes “interim” cuts.  “We’ll have some negotiations, with short-term extensions
with spending cuts in the interim, is my guess,” the Wisconsin
Republican said yesterday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” program.
“We’re not looking for a government shutdown.”  The Republican-controlled  House of Representatives   voted 
235-189 on Feb. 19 to slash at least $61 billion from current
spending, setting the stage for a fight with Democrats that
threatens to bring government to a standstill after March 4 when
the current continuing resolution expires. Senate Democrats have
balked at the cuts while Republicans are saying they will agree
to a temporary spending authority only if it includes reductions
in funding.  “I won’t support a CR (continuing resolution) unless it
has some spending cuts,” Senator  Lindsey Graham , a Republican
from  South Carolina  and a member of the Budget Committee, told
NBC’s “Meet the Press,” echoing House Speaker  John Boehner ’s
remarks of last week.  “I am not going to move any kind of short-term CR at
current levels,” Boehner, an Ohio Republican, told reporters in
Washington on Feb. 17.  ‘Decent Chance’ of Shutdown    Peter Morici , a professor of business at the  University of
Maryland  in College Park, said there is a “decent chance” of a
partial government shutdown, as occurred in late 1995 and early
1996 during  Bill Clinton ’s presidency.  Following the previous shutdown, which pitted Clinton
against Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the Republicans
lost support. “After the shutdown, Gingrich was unable to hold
his caucus together,” said Morici. President  Barack Obama  “is
gambling that centrist Republicans will spin off.”  Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat from  New York , accused
Boehner of using talk of a government shutdown as leverage in
the budget battle.  “Many Republicans have said a shutdown is a good thing,”
Schumer said yesterday on  CNN ’s “State of the Union” program.
“One thinks they want to use the shutdown to get their way.”  The $1.2 trillion spending bill approved by the House
yesterday would ban funds for President Obama’s health-care
overhaul and for Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions.
It also would scrap “net neutrality” Internet rules and block
regulations on  greenhouse gases  and for-profit colleges. The
White House has threatened a presidential veto.  Cuts Sought  The legislation seeks to fund the government for the
remaining seven months of the current fiscal year, which expires
Sept. 30. Current spending authority ends March 4, and without a
continuing resolution the government will shut down.  Appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” Senator Claire McCaskill,
a Democrat from  Missouri , said she is willing to approve some
reductions in current spending in order to get an agreement.  Senators Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and assistant
majority leader, and Republicans Graham and Tom Coburn of  Oklahoma  agreed on the need to work together to avoid a
shutdown.  “I hope we’ll find a way to resolve this by reducing
spending in a bipartisan fashion,” Graham said on NBC’s “Meet
the Press.”  “I don’t think we are” faced with a government shutdown,
said Coburn, who served with Durbin on a presidential deficit
panel, on the “Fox News Sunday” program. “I think nobody
wants that to happen, and I think everybody realizes that we
have to make some significant cuts.”  Conrad’s Warning  Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad said his
Democratic-controlled chamber will reduce this year’s budget by
about half what House Republicans are demanding. The North
Dakota Democrat has warned that the federal government may grind
to a halt if Boehner won’t negotiate.  The Republican plan “will not be successful in the Senate,
even though I think virtually everybody understands we’ve got to
cut spending,” Conrad said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt .”  Ryan said on “Face the Nation” that Republicans will
propose “serious solutions” to reducing the deficit. “We
can’t keep borrowing, can’t keep spending and making empty
promises to people.”  Economic Recovery  Appearing on the same program, Representative Chris Van Hollen of  Maryland , the ranking Democrat on the budget panel,
said the economy needs to be “fully in gear” before the
government can make the dramatic cuts proposed by Republicans.  Obama sent Congress a $3.7 trillion budget last week for
fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. The document projects the
federal deficit will exceed $1 trillion for the fourth straight
year in 2012 before falling to lower levels by the middle of the
decade. The deficit for the current year is forecast to hit a
record $1.6 trillion, or 10.9 percent of gross domestic product,
up from the $1.4 trillion the administration previously
estimated.  The Republican plan for the current fiscal year, subject to
more than 90 hours of debate prior to yesterday’s vote, would
kill more than 100 programs and cut funding for hundreds more.  To contact the reporters on this story:
