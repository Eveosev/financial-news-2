  Centrica Plc  said it has “nothing
to hide” should the U.K.  Competition Commission  decide to
investigate the company’s profit, the  Daily Telegraph  said,
citing a Centrica spokesman.  The owner of British Gas may report a 30 percent surge in
profit on Thursday, which could lead regulator Ofgem to ask the
Competition Commission to start an inquiry, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
