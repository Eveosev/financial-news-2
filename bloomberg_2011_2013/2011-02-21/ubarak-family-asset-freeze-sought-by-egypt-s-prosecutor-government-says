Egypt’s public prosecutor asked the
country’s foreign minister to request the assets abroad of
former President  Hosni Mubarak  and his family be frozen.  The request includes Mubarak’s wife as well as his two sons
and their wives, the Cairo-based office of the public prosecutor
said in a faxed statement today, citing people in the judiciary.
The prosecutor’s office received a number of complaints about
the magnitude of the wealth of Mubarak and his family, it said.  Mubarak submitted a financial disclosure statement to
judicial authorities, the state-run Middle East News Agency
reported yesterday. Mubarak has routinely filed such statements
in the past, the news agency said, citing an unidentified
representative of the former president. The representative
denied media reports about the size of Mubarak’s wealth and
about accounts and properties he held abroad, it said.  Mubarak stepped down Feb. 11 after 30 years as president
following a popular revolt.  Egypt ’s army dissolved the
parliament and suspended the constitution ahead of elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
