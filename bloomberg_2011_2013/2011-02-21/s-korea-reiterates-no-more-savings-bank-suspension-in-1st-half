  South Korea ’s financial regulator
reiterated it doesn’t plan suspend operations at additional
savings banks in the first half, after issuing six-month
suspensions at seven banks this year.  “We don’t foresee any more business suspensions at savings
banks in the first half unless there are excessive deposit
withdrawals,” the  Financial Services Commission  said in an e-
mailed statement today. “We’ll provide liquidity to healthy
savings banks so their businesses won’t be hurt because of the
market uneasiness.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
