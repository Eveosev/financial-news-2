The Australian dollar traded within
0.7 percent of a nine-month high versus the yen as a gauge of
volatility for the two currencies this month reached its lowest
since 2007, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.    New Zealand ’s currency reached the strongest level in more
than a week against the yen on speculation Fonterra Cooperative
Group Ltd., the world’s largest dairy exporter, will raise its
forecast for payouts to farmers today, boosting the nation’s
recovery. Gains by both currencies against the  U.S. dollar  were
limited amid concern over escalating tensions in the Middle
East.  “Volatility is so low that the carry trade has got to
start coming back again,” said  Tony Allen , global head of  currency trading  in Sydney at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. “The Aussie will be bid on dips.”  Australia’s currency traded at 83.87 yen as of 9:52 a.m. in
Sydney from 83.92 yen yesterday, after touching 84.48 on Feb.
18, the strongest since May 13. The so-called Aussie bought
$1.0082 from $1.0094. New Zealand’s dollar reached 63.76 yen,
the highest since Feb. 10, before trading at 63.42 yen from
63.51 yesterday. It fetched 76.28 cents from 76.38 cents.  One-month implied volatility for the Australian dollar
versus the yen closed at 9.74 on Feb. 18, the least since July
2007. Traders use implied volatility, a measure of perceived
risk, to gauge expectations for currency swings and in setting
options prices.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in  Australia  and
3 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  Auckland-based Fonterra may today raise its forecast
payment to farmers by as much as 50 New Zealand cents (38 cents)
per kilogram of milk solids as global demand for dairy products
soars, the Dominion Post reported, citing an economist. A 30-
cent rise could add around NZ$450 million to New Zealand’s
economy, the Wellington-based newspaper said. Today’s increase
may be as high as 50 New Zealand cents, the Post reported,
citing ANZ National Bank Chief Economist Cameron Bagrie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
