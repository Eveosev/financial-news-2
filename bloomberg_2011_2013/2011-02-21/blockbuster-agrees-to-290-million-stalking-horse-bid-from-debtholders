  Blockbuster Inc ., the bankrupt movie
rental chain, agreed to sell itself to a group of debtholders
for $290 million in a stalking horse bid that is subject to
higher and better offers.  The company entered into an asset purchase agreement with
Cobalt Video Holdco LLC, formed by secured noteholders Monarch
Alternative Capital LP, Owl Creek Asset Management LP, Stonehill
Capital Management LLC and Varde Partners Inc. The deal needs
approval from  bankruptcy court .  Blockbuster is also seeking authorization from the court to
start an auction for the company. The move will help accelerate
bankruptcy proceedings, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim
Keyes said in a statement.   Interested parties would need to bid within 30 days if
Blockbusterâ€™s request for an auction is granted. The final sale
approval hearing will probably be held before April 20, Dallas-
based Blockbuster said.  The company was founded in 1985 and grew to serve almost
47 million customers daily in the U.S. and 16 other countries.  Viacom Inc ., which owns the Paramount film studio, bought
Blockbuster from Wayne Huizenga for $8.4 billion in 1994, then
spun it off to shareholders in 2004.  Blockbuster filed for  bankruptcy protection  on Sept. 23.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
