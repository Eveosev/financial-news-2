German tax revenue rose in January
as economic growth helped trim unemployment, the  Finance
Ministry  said.  Federal and state tax revenue grew a combined 5.5 percent
compared with a year ago, the ministry said today in its monthly
report. The jump in revenue partly reflected weak tax growth in
2010 as  Germany  was pulling out of recession, the ministry said.  The German economy,  Europe ’s biggest, is benefitting from
expanding exports and consumption, helping push unemployment
down. Economic growth this year may exceed the government’s
forecast rate of 2.3 percent, the ministry said.  At the same, inflation pushed by global commodity prices
may dampen the expected rate of economic growth if manufacturers
are forced to pass on higher costs to consumers, it added.  Sales-tax revenue grew 8.5 percent in January compared with
a year ago and income-tax receipts rose 6.2 percent, the
ministry said. Federal tax income rose 11 percent on the year,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
