Ukraineâ€™s central bank offered to
bail out VAT Nadra Bank through a subordinate loan from a state-
run Oshchadbank lender, weekly newspaper  Zerkalo Nedeli  reported
without saying where it got the information.  The Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy wants the government the
increase the capital of Oshchadbank by 3.5 billion hryvnia
($439.8 million) and then transfer the money as a loan to Nadra,
the newspaper said.  The regulator also offers the government to save another
lender, PAT Rodovid Bank, through the state-run Ukrainian
Exports-Imports bank, Zerkalo said.  PAT Ukrgazbank , which was bailed by the government in 2009,
may merge with another state-managed lender, PAT AKB Kiev, the
newspaper said.  Should all those plans to be approved by the  International
Monetary Fund , the central bank may push lenders in which the
government owns less than 100 percent, to be sold in initial
public offerings, Zerkalo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
