Hungary’s forint extended its drop
against the euro on expectations policy makers will refrain from
raising borrowing costs today and after RBC Capital said new
rate setters may be more “dovish” than investors expect.  The forint depreciated as much as 0.5 percent and traded
0.4 percent weaker at 271.20 per euro as of 11:02 a.m. in
Budapest, making it the world’s worst-performing currency today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
