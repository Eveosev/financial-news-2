Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co., the world’s third-largest shipyard, said A.P.
Moller-Maersk A/S has the options to buy 20 more of the world’s
biggest container ships on top of 10 already ordered.  The full order, for as many as 30 18,000-container ships,
would be worth about $5.4 billion, the Seoul-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
