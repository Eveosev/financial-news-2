The shekel rose to the highest in
almost four weeks against the dollar and Israeli  government
bonds  dropped on bets the central bank will raise interest rates
for a second month today.  Bank of  Israel  Governor Stanley Fischer, who last month
increased the benchmark rate to 2.25 percent, will lift the rate
to 2.5 percent today, according to all 19 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The bank will announce its decision at 5:30
p.m. in  Jerusalem .  “Some are even expecting a 50 basis-point increase, which
puts further pressure on the shekel,” said Gil Regutkovitz, an
analyst at online foreign-currency trading platform Easy Forex
in Ramat Gan, Israel.  The Israeli currency rose 0.5 percent to 3.596 against the
dollar at 4:50 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The shekel climbed to 3.5950
earlier, the strongest since Jan. 26. The currency advanced 0.8
percent to 4.914 against the euro.  The  Bank of Israel , which has been buying foreign currency
since March 2008 to curb appreciation, may buy dollars if the
shekel breaches the 3.6 level, Regutkovitz said. Foreign-
currency reserves rose to a record $73.4 billion in January, the
central bank said on Feb. 7. The bank bought $2.09 billion and
benefitted from a revaluation of its reserves by $628 million.  Bonds dropped, pushing the yield on the benchmark 5 percent
Mimshal Shiklit due January 2020 up 2 basis points to 5.08
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
