Hyundai Wia Corp. , an auto-parts
unit of  Hyundai Motor Co ., advanced on it first day of trading
in Seoul amid speculation that rising global auto sales will
boost earnings.  Hyundai Wia rose to 70,200 won on the Korea Exchange at the
3 p.m. close on the Korea Exchange, compared with the initial
public offering price of 65,000 won, after investors bid for
103.7 times the number of shares allocated to individuals in the
IPO. The stock earlier surged as much as 18 percent to 76,500
won. The benchmark  Kospi Index  fell 0.4 percent.  Global auto sales may exceed 80 million vehicles in 2012,  Jeff Schuster , director of forecasting for researcher J.D. Power
and Associates, said in December. Hyundai Motor, the fastest-
growing mass-market automaker in the U.S. last year, and
affiliate  Kia Motors Corp . expect to boost sales 10 percent this
year because of new models and rising demand in emerging markets
including China and developed markets such as the U.S.  “What’s attractive about this company is that it has fast-
growing automakers as its biggest shareholders,” said Suh Sung Moon, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co., who rates
the stock a “buy” with a 12-month share-price estimate of
85,000 won. “I’m also optimistic because demand for machinery
is recovering and the company has a good relationship with its
labor union.”  Machine Tools, Weapons  Hyundai Wia, which also produces machine tools and weapons,
and its shareholder Kia Motors together raised 520 billion won
($467 million) by offering 8 million new and existing shares at
above the indicative price range of 53,000 won to 60,000 won
apiece in the IPO. Mirae Asset Securities Co. arranged the sale.  Changwon, South Korea-based Hyundai Wia, which has four
factories in China and  India , plans to use the funds to build
more plants in these countries as well as eastern  Europe  and  South America .  Hyundai Motor owns a 33.3 percent stake in Hyundai Wia,
while Kia holds 17.7 percent after the share sale.  Hyundai Wia’s net income more than doubled to 77 billion
won in the first nine months of 2010 from a year earlier,
according to a Nov. 15 regulatory filing. It has yet to release
data for the full year.  South Korean companies raised a record 10.1 trillion won in
IPOs last year, according to Korea Exchange Inc., as they bet an
economic recovery, corporate earnings growth and low  interest
rates  would boost equities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
