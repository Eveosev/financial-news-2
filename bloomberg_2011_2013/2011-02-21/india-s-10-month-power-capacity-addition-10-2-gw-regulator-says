Indian power utilities added about
10.2 gigawatts of capacity between April 2010 and last month,
equivalent to 48 percent of a full-year government target, the
Central Electricity Authority said in a  report  on its website.  Thermal capacity addition, including coal and gas-fired
units, totaled 9.5 gigawatts during the period, about 51 percent
of a yearly target, according to the regulator.    India  added 480 megawatts of capacity in January compared
with 490 megawatts a year earlier, according to the report. As
of last month, coal-fired plants accounted for more than half of
the country’s generation capacity.  There were 29 coal-fired generators with fuel stockpiles to
last less than seven days, compared with 25 to 30 days typically
as of Feb. 17, according to the Central Electricity Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
