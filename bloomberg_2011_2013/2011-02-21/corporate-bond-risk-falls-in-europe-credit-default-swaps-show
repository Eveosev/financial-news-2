  Abu Dhabi  and Qatar led an increase
in the cost of insuring government debt in North Africa and the
Middle East on concern political upheaval may spread and disrupt
oil supply.  Credit-default swaps on Qatar jumped 7 basis points to 113,
the highest level in a year, and Abu Dhabi rose 6.5 to 114, CMA
prices show.  Oil rose to a two-year high, fueling concern of global
inflation, as violence escalated in the region. Muammar Qaddafi’s son called on protesters in Libya to engage in
dialogue or face a civil war while in Yemen, demonstrators took
to the streets for an 11th day as President Ali Abdullah Saleh
said calls for regime change are “not logical.”  “Geopolitical tension is driving sentiment in the
market,” said Rajeev Shah, a credit strategist at BNP Paribas
SA in London. “Inflation is the key concern on back of the oil
spike.”    Libya  was downgraded one step to BBB by  Fitch Ratings  and
placed on rating watch negative as security forces attacked
anti-government protesters and Saif al-Islam Qaddafi said the
country faces a civil war in which “rivers of blood will
flow.”  Political Resolution  “Lack of a political resolution to the conflict and
escalating violence would likely result in a further
downgrade,” Fitch said in a statement, while noting the country
is the only one it rates that has no debt. “This would
especially be the case if disruption extended to Libya’s oil
production.”  Bahrain’s rankings were reduced at  Standard & Poor’s  as the
island kingdom reels under anti-government protests. Credit-
default swaps on Bahrain rose 7.5 basis points to 312.5, the
highest since July 2009, according to CMA.  Swaps on  Saudi Arabia , used as a measure of confidence in
the country which also has no debt, rose 5 basis points to a 19-
month high of 145. Swaps on Dubai increased 10 to 447, Lebanon
rose 9 to 371, Morocco climbed 8 to 188,  Egypt  was 3.5 higher at
357.5 and  Israel  was up 4.5 at 157.5.  The region’s unrest also weighed on corporate credit, with
the cost of insuring debt of Eni SpA, the largest foreign oil
producer in Libya, up 12 basis points to 90.5.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 50 companies
with mostly junk credit ratings increased 9 basis points to 391,
after earlier falling to the lowest since January 2008,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2 basis points to 98.75. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and insurers increased
3.75 to 166 and the subordinated index was 5 higher at 277.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting $10
million of debt from default for five years is equivalent to
$1,000 a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
