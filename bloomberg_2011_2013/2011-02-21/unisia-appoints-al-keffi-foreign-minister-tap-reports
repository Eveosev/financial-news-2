Tunisia’s interim government
announced that Mouldi Al-Keffi will replace Ahmed Ounaies as the
country’s foreign minister, the state-run news agency TAP
reported today, citing a statement.  Ounaies submitted his resignation after criticism of his
praise for  France ’s Foreign Minister Michele Alliot-Marie, the
Tunis-based news agency reported.  Hundreds of workers at the Tunisian foreign ministry went
on a strike last week to protest the minister’s praise of
Alliot-Marie. Ounaies said he had always dreamed of meeting with
the French foreign minister, the news wire reported.  Alliot-Marie has faced calls to resign for accepting a
flight from a Tunisian businessman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
