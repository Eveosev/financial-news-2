Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who led  Georgia 
to independence in 1991 and was ousted in a military coup later
that year, didn’t commit suicide in 1993, his son said, urging
authorities to start an investigation.  "Based on the documents and the conclusions of experts,
myself and my commission have ruled out the possibility that my
father killed himself," Konstantine Gamsakhurdia, the oldest of
the former president’s three sons, told reporters in the
Georgian capital, Tbilisi, today.  Gamsakhurdia, elected president in 1990 when Georgia was
still part of the  Soviet Union , was overthrown a year later as
the country plunged into civil war. He was reburied on March 31,
2007, in Tbilisi.  The conditions of his body raised questions about the
circumstances of his death, the younger Gamsakhurdia said today.
The commission, which completed 15 months of work, will send its
363-page report to the public prosecutor’s office, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
