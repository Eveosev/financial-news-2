Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper urged opposition members to back the budget his
government plans to introduce next month because he said voters
don’t want an election.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  has said he will present his
next fiscal plan in March. Harper’s Conservative government
holds a minority of seats in the House of Commons and needs
support of one of three opposition parties to pass the budget.
If the fiscal plan is defeated, elections would follow.  “We are in the early stages of a fragile recovery so I
encourage everybody in Parliament to focus on the real needs of
the economy and not on politicking and electoral positioning,”
Harper said today at a televised press conference in  Vancouver .
“I am quite confident that any member of Parliament who puts
the best interest of the Canadian economy before all else will
find good reasons to support the budget.”  Harper declined to comment on a  new poll  by Nanos Research
that indicates Conservatives are leading Liberals.  About 40 percent of respondents said they would vote
Conservative, compared with about 27 percent for the  Liberal
Party , Nanos said. The company polled 1,016 Canadians by
telephone from Feb. 11 to Feb. 14. Results are considered
accurate to within 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.  “The public does not want an election,” Harper said. “I
do not want an election. Our government is preparing to govern
and we will present a budget that is in the interest of the
Canadian economy.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
