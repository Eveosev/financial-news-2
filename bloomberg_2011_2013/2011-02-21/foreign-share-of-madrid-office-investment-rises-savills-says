Foreign investment in  Madrid  office
buildings climbed to 34 percent of the total last year from 2
percent in 2009, led by companies including Deutsche Bank AG’s
RREEF  Europe  and Moor Park Capital Partners LLP,  Savills Plc 
said.  The amount spent on offices by non-Spanish companies
climbed to 235.4 million euros ($322 million), the London-based
property broker said today in an e-mailed statement. In all, 700
million euros was invested in the market, 14 percent more than a
year earlier.  “The rising interest shown by foreign investors is
encouraging,” Luis Espadas, head of capital markets for Savills
in Madrid, said in the statement.  Last year, RREEF Europe bought 153 bank branches and two
offices from  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA . Moor Park
Capital Partners acquired assets owned by Banco Sabadell SA.
Both were sale-and-leaseback transactions.  The vacancy rate in Madrid’s central business district was
about 5 percent at the end of 2010 and monthly rents were 27
euros to 28 euros a square meter, Savills said. That’s 35
percent less than the maximum rent during the past decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
