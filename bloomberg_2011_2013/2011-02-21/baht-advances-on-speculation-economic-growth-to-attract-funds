  Thailand ’s baht gained to its
strongest level in almost a month as data today showed economy
grew in 2010 at the fastest pace in 15 years and export growth
accelerated last month.  Overseas investors bought $476 million more of Thai
equities than they sold last week, according to exchange data.
Gross domestic product expanded 7.8 percent last year, compared
with a contraction of 2.3 percent the year before, the National
Economic and Social Development Board said today. That was the
fastest pace since 1995. Consumer prices posted the biggest gain
in five months in January, according to government data this
month.  “The growth story in Asia is still intact and that will
help attract funds into the region,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a
global economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“Inflationary pressure is also growing, boosting speculation
some central banks in the region will boost interest rates.”  The baht added 0.2 percent to 30.55 per dollar as of 3:24
p.m. in Bangkok from Feb. 17 and touched 30.47, the highest
level since Jan. 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has strengthened 1.2 percent this month, the
fourth-best performance among 10 most actively traded currencies
in Asia. Onshore financial markets were closed Feb. 18 for a
public holiday.  Overseas sales climbed 22.3 percent in January from a year
earlier after having increased 18.8 percent the previous month,
a separate report today showed. Sales abroad account for about
two-thirds of Southeast  Asia ’s second-largest economy.  The Bank of Thailand lifted its benchmark interest rate
four times since June to 2.25 percent and signaled further
increases. Consumer prices rose 3.03 percent last month,
according to Feb. 1 data.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, was unchanged from Feb. 17
at 2.45 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
yield on the 3.125 percent debt due December 2015 gained nine
basis points to 3.51 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
