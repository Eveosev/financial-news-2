Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip
Erdogan  and main opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu will both
attend ceremonies to open a new suburban rail system in Izmir,
Sabah newspaper said.  The 80-kilometer (50-mile) Egeray rail system was built
with money from the Izmir municipality, run by Kilicdaroglu’s
Republican People’s Party, and the Transport Ministry in Ankara,
Sabah said. The combination of central government funds and an
opposition-led municipality is a first, the newspaper said,
citing Transport Minister Binali Yildirim.  The rail system cost a total of 1.3 billion liras ($820
million) and will be opened March 6, Sabah said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
