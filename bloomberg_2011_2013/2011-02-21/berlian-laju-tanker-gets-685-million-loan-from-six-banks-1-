PT Berlian Laju Tanker, the
Indonesian shipping company, received commitments from six banks
for a $685 million  term loan .  The facility, Berlian Laju’s largest ever, is secured by 43
ships and has a maturity of five years, according to a Singapore
stock exchange statement. It also includes a debt service
coverage covenant which is based on cash flows and “liquidity
amount, allowing the company enhanced flexibility.”  Berlian Laju, based in Jakarta, has $2.27 billion of bonds
and loans maturing before the end of 2017, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds of this facility will be used to
repay debt and fund  three ships  under construction.  The loan will help trim Berlian Laju’s debt payments by
$166.9 million over the next three years, “increasing liquidity
and the company’s debt service coverage ratio significantly.”
It will also fund 81 percent of the company’s new building
capital requirements in 2011, the statement said.  DnB NOR Bank ASA, Nordea Bank AB, Standard Chartered Plc,
ING Groep NV, NIBC Bank NV and BNP Paribas SA are the lenders,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
