  International Ferro Metals Ltd ., an
operator of mines in  South Africa  that reported a fiscal first-
half loss and reduced cash, will start up its Sky chrome mine by
the end of April, funded mainly by its mining contractor.  “The intention is to get in a contractor to do the open
pit mining and that contractor will bear most of the capital
cost,” Chief Executive Officer David Kovarsky said today.  Sky may produce 100,000 metric tons of ore a month from
January 2012, and sales will help fund the cost of a processing
plant, Kovarsky told a conference call, declining to elaborate.
The contractor, to be named in about 10 days, will recover the
costs of building the mine by adding them to its fees, he said.  The company today reported a net loss of 106 million rand
($15 million) in the fiscal first half through Dec. 31, from 104
million rand a year earlier. The pretax loss of 160 million rand
was almost three times Numis Securities Ltd.’s forecast. Gains
in the South African currency eroded earnings in dollars, said
the London-based producer of the stainless steel ingredient.  International Ferro fell 8.3 percent to 19.5 pence by 11:26
a.m. in London trading, the biggest decline in a month and
bringing the company’s slump this year to 33 percent.  The company, rebuilding faulty furnaces and resolving
technical difficulties at a power plant, had net debt of 216
million rand by Dec. 31, compared with net cash of 47 million
rand six months earlier. It is negotiating a 160 million rand
five-year loan to fund the UG2 concentrator plant to boost
output, the company said in a presentation on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
