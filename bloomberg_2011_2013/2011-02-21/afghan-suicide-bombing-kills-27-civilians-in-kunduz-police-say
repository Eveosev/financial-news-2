A suicide bombing in the northern
Afghan province of Kunduz killed 27 civilians, including women,
as they waited to collect national  identity cards  at a
government office, the region’s police chief said.  “Many others were wounded” as the bomber struck the
province’s Imam Sahib district, Abdul Rahman Sayedkheli, the
most senior police official, said by phone. “The death toll
will increase as the police are carrying the wounded people into
nearby hospitals.”  Civilian deaths rose last year to 2,421, about six people
per day, and local media blamed Taliban-led insurgents for 63
percent of those killings, said a report last month by a Kabul-
based group,  Afghan Rights Monitor . U.S.-led forces were blamed
for 21 percent, the report said.  NATO airstrikes killed at least 35 people in eastern  Afghanistan  last week, the New York Times reported today. While
NATO officers said the raid in Kunar province was a successful
mission against Taliban insurgents, Afghan officials said it
caused “mass civilian casualties,” the paper said. NATO is
probing the incident.  To contact the reporters on this story:
