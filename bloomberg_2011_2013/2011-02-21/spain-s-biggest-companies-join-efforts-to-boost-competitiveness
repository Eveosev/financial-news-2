A group of 17 Spanish companies,
including  Telefonica SA , Banco Santander SA, Repsol YPF SA and  Inditex SA , created a think-tank to boost the country’s economic
competitiveness and regain trust from international investors.  The aim is to generate ideas and help Spain improve
competitiveness and its image so that it can restore trust from
international investors and achieve economic recovery,
Telefonica Chairman Cesar Alierta, who is heading the group,
said.  “We all agree that our economy has problems,” Alierta
said today at Telefonica’s headquarters in Madrid. “Boosting
competitiveness requires change, measures and reforms and also
experience, skills and shared work.”  Other companies in the group are Acciona SA, Mapfre SA,
Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA, Iberdrola SA and  Ferrovial SA . Apart from the companies, Spain’s Institute for
the Family Business is part of the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
