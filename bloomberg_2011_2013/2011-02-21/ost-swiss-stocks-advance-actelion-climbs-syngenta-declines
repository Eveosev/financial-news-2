Stocks in Switzerland fell, dragging
the  Swiss Market Index  to the biggest drop in three weeks, as
tensions escalated in the Middle East after Libyan security
forces clashed with anti-government protesters.    Zurich Financial Services AG  and Swiss Reinsurance Co. led
losses in insurance companies.  Syngenta AG , the biggest maker of
agricultural chemicals, tracked a decline in food prices.  The SMI of the largest and most actively traded companies
decreased 0.5 percent to 6,683.87 at the 5:30 p.m. close in
Zurich, the biggest decline since Jan. 31. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also dropped 0.5 percent.  The benchmark SMI has climbed 3.9 percent this year as
investors speculated that the economic recovery is accelerating
and policies to support indebted euro-area countries will
succeed. Still, demand for overnight loans from the  European
Central Bank  was elevated for a third day, holding close to a
20-month high.  “We’re seeing sovereign risk combined with geopolitics,”
said Francisco Salvador, a strategist at FGA/MG Valores in
Madrid. “There’s been a bit of euphoria in markets lately so
any excuse will drive profit taking.”  Libyan security forces attacked anti-government protesters
as demonstrations spread across the Middle East and North
Africa. Muammar Qaddafi’s son called on protesters to engage in
dialogue or face a civil war that risks the country’s oil
wealth, as a widening revolt posed the most serious challenge to
his father’s 41 years of rule.  Zurich, Swiss Re       Zurich Financial, Switzerland’s biggest insurer, dropped
1.6 percent to 270.2 Swiss francs. Swiss Re, the world’s second-
largest reinsurer, dropped 1.9 percent to 58.1 francs.  Swiss
Life Holding AG  slipped 2.8 percent to 155.8 francs.    Credit Suisse Group AG  dropped 1.5 percent to 44.33 francs,
ending five days of gains.  UBS AG  fell 1.4 percent to 18.67
francs, even after being upgraded to “buy” at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  The Stoxx 600 Banks Index tumbled 2.7 percent today, its
worst day since November. European banks borrowed 14.2 billion
euros ($19.4 billion) via the central bank’s marginal lending
facility on Feb. 18, down from 16 billion euros on Feb. 17,
which was the most since June 2009. The ECB charges banks 1.75
percent for overnight loans, 75 basis points more than in its
main refinancing operations.  Syngenta fell 1.4 percent to 307.5 francs. Soybeans slid
the most in three months at the end of last week on speculation
that monetary tightening in  China  and improving prospects for
South American crops will lower demand for U.S. supplies. Corn
fell from a 31-month high. Monsanto Co., the world’s largest
seed company, lost 2.4 percent in New York trading on Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
