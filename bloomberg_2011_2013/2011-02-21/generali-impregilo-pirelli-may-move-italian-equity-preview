Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index 
dropped for a third day, losing 236.24, or 1.1 percent, to
21,993.96 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Milan. Trading on the
Italian exchange started 6 1/2 hours later because of
“technical issues.”  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Ansaldo SpA (STS IM) sank 2.4 percent to 10 euros,
retreating for the fourth day.  Finmeccanica SpA  (FNC IM)’s
railway technology unit has about 10 percent of its order
backlog in Libya, Gruppo Banca Leonardo said in a note.  Finmeccanica dropped 1.4 percent to 9.11 euros.    Assicurazioni Generali SpA  (G IM) retreated 2.2 percent to
15.88 euros, extending yesterday’s loss. Luxottica Group SpA
founder Leonardo Del Vecchio resigned from the board of
Assicurazioni Generali.    Buongiorno SpA  (BNG IM) surged 5.3 percent to 1.38 euros,
the biggest gain in six weeks. Mediobanca Securities initiated
coverage of the mobile entertainment company with an
“outperform” recommendation and a price estimate of 1.88
euros.  Buzzi Unicem SpA (BZU IM) dropped 1.5 percent to 9.89
euros, the fourth straight loss for the stock. Equita Sim SpA
downgraded Italy’s second-biggest cement maker to “reduce”
from “hold.”    Tenaris SA  (TEN IM), the producer of seamless steel tubes
used in the oil industry, rose 1.2 percent to 17.43 euros. Oil
climbed to its highest price in more than two years as investors
speculated that Libya’s crackdown on anti-government protesters
will disrupt the country’s oil production.  “The shares benefited from rising oil prices and the fact
that unlike  Saipem SpA  (SPM IM), the company does not have
orders in Libya,” said Alberto Magnani, a fund manager at
Abbacus Sim SpA in Genoa, Italy. Saipem dropped 1.9 percent to
35.38 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
