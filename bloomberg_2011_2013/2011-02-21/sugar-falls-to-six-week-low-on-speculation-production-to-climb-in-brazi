Sugar fell for a third day in  London 
to a six-week low on speculation output will increase in Brazil
and  India , the world’s largest producers.  The nations’ sugar production will climb as farmers
increase crop area, Nick Kouchoukos, vice president at Chicago-
based researcher Lanworth Inc., told a conference in Dubai
yesterday. Brazil’s output will climb 5.1 percent to 35.2
million metric tons in the 2011-12 season, while production in
India may jump 24 percent to 25.5 million tons in the year
through September, he said.  “The lack of bullish news and indications that the
Brazilian Center South crop will be higher than the previous
season are likely pressuring values modestly,” Keith Flury, an
analyst at Rabobank International in London, said in an e-mail
today. Center South is  Brazil ’s main producing region.  White, or refined, sugar for May delivery fell $4.10, or
0.6 percent, to $716.50 a ton at 9:51 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
London. Prices reached $713, the lowest level since Jan. 7. ICE
Futures U.S., where raw sugar, arabica coffee and cocoa trade in
New York, is closed today for the Presidents’ Day holiday.  India may have a 6.7 million-ton surplus at Sept. 30, of
which 5 million tons will be carried over as reserves into the
new year starting Oct. 1, leaving an “exportable surplus” of
1.7 million tons, Abinash Verma, director general of the Indian
Sugar Mills Association, told the conference yesterday.  ‘Commercial Support’  “With the market talking about swinging into a surplus in
2011-12 and memories of last year’s crash fresh, prices have
slipped lower,” Flury said. “However, there has been strong
commercial support as values have fallen, and supplies are still
tight enough to underpin prices.”  A bigger harvest in India and Brazil may help fill a global
deficit that sent raw sugar to a 30-year high this month. Prices
slid 40 percent in last year’s first half before doubling in the
final six months.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in  New York  sugar futures in the week
ended Feb. 15, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Net-long positions, or bets prices will rise,
fell by 11,356 contracts, or 7 percent, from a week earlier.  Robusta coffee for May delivery gained $18, or 0.8 percent,
to $2,355 a ton in London.  Coffee-bean exports from  Indonesia ’s main growing regions
on Sumatra island, which plunged 23 percent last year as La Nina
rains hurt output, may fail to rebound in 2011 as the weather
event lingers, Muchtar Luthfie, head of research and development
at the Lampung branch of the Association of Indonesian Coffee
Exporters and Industries, said Feb. 18.  Cocoa for March delivery added 17 pounds, or 0.7 percent,
to 2,297 pounds ($3,724) a ton on NYSE Liffe after gaining for
two weeks in a row.    Hedge funds  are the most bullish on cocoa in almost seven
months as political turmoil threatens supplies from  Ivory Coast ,
the world’s biggest producer. In the week ended Feb. 15, net-
long positions gained 11 percent to 20,936 futures and options
contracts, the highest since July, CFTC data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
