Oleg Deripaska’s GAZ Group expects
to sign a deal with  Volkswagen AG  this week to build Skoda and
Volkswagen cars on contract, the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview with Siegfried Wolf, chairman of Russian
Machines OJSC, the industrial holding group that owns GAZ.  The deal must be signed by the end of the week because of a
deadline set by the Russian government for carmakers to reveal
plans for local production, Wolf said, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
