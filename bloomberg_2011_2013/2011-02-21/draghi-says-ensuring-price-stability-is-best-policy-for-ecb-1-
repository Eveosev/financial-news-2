European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Mario Draghi  said the best contribution policy
makers can make to the economy is to ensure inflation is kept
under control.  “The ECB has the mandate to ensure price stability” and
the “best contribution the central bank can make is to continue
to ensure  price stability , anchoring inflation expectations,”
he said at an event in Bologna,  Italy  today. “Inflation
expectations remained solidly anchored throughout the crisis
which allowed ECB to react quickly and in an effective way.”  Draghi, who is head of Italy’s central bank, also said that
the impact of the crisis was lessened by the ability of the ECB
to act.  He said that the “greatest obstacle to the recovery is not
interest rates, which have never been so low,” but the level of
risk premiums.  To contact the reporter on this story:
