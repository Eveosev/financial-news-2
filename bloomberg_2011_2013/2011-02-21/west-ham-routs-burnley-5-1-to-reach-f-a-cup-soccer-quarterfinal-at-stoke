Thomas Hitzlsperger marked his debut
with a goal as West Ham beat Burnley 5-1 to set up a
quarterfinal at Stoke in English soccer’s F.A. Cup.  The German midfielder, who missed the past six months
with a thigh injury, put West Ham ahead with a 23rd-minute shot
and  Carlton Cole  scored twice in three second-half minutes to
make it 3-0.  Winston Reid headed the Hammers’ fourth at Upton Park in
east  London  before  Robert Green ’s botched clearance gifted
Burnley’s Jay Rodriguez a 70th-minute goal. Freddie Sears
restored the Premier League team’s four-goal advantage in injury
time.  The quarterfinals of English soccer’s oldest knockout
competition are scheduled March 12 and 13.  F.A. CUP QUARTERFINAL DRAW:  ===========================  Stoke City               vs   West Ham  Man.
