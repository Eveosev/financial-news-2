Copper futures turnover on the Multi
Commodity Exchange of India Ltd., the nation’s biggest such
bourse, climbed last month amid increased price volatility, an
exchange executive said.  Average daily volume expanded to 123,243.85 metric tons in
January, compared with 110,887 tons a year earlier, according to
the  exchange . Turnover rose 37 percent to 54.1 billion rupees
($1.2 billion) from a year earlier.  Global copper prices have rallied 33 percent this year and
reached a record $10,190 a ton on Feb. 15 on the  London  Metal
Exchange. The metal’s 30-day historical volatility, a measure of
how much the price fluctuates, rose to 21.95 percent last week,
the highest level since December.  “If prices are going to be volatile this year, I think
more corporates will come on this platform and hedge,” Sumesh
Parasrampuria, director of business development at the MCX, as
the exchange is known, said in an interview on Feb. 18.  Copper for delivery in three months gained 0.2 percent to
$9,883.50 in London at 11:50 a.m. Mumbai time. February-delivery
futures on the MCX, the most-active contract, rose 0.5 percent
to 447.75 rupees a kilogram at 12 p.m.  ---With assistance from Glenys Sim in  Singapore . Editors: Ravil
