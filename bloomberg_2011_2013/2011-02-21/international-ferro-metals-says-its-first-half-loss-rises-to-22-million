  International Ferro Metals Ltd ., a
ferrochrome producer in  South Africa , posted a pretax loss of
160 million rand in its fiscal first half, which ended on Dec.
31, compared with a 145 million-rand loss in the year-earlier
period. The reasons for the increased loss were lower
ferrochrome prices and a stronger rand.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
