  Rachel Alexandra , the filly who won
the 2009  Preakness Stakes  and then Horse of the Year honors, was
bred to two-time Horse of the Year Curlin this morning in
Kentucky, the horses’ owner said.  Rachel Alexandra retired from thoroughbred racing in
September and was sent to Stonestreet Farm in Lexington,
Kentucky, for breeding with Curlin.  “The breeding of these two singular athletes is the
culmination of two equine racing careers without precedent,”  Jess Jackson , major owner of both horses, said in an e-mailed
statement. “We have been anticipating this introduction for
some time now. Imagine what possibilities those two super horses
might produce.”  Jackson is founder and owner of the  Kendall-Jackson Wine
Estates .  Rachel Alexandra went undefeated in 2009, including a 20
1/2-length win in the Kentucky Oaks and then a victory in the
Preakness, the second event in racing’s Triple Crown. Jackson
bought her after the  Kentucky  Oaks victory.  Rachel Alexandra opened 2010 with two runner-up finishes
before claiming the Fleur De Lis Handicap and the Lady’s Secret
Stakes. She finished second in the Personal Ensign Stakes on
Aug. 29, her final race.  Curlin in 2008 became the first thoroughbred since Cigar in
1996 to retain Horse of the Year honors. He won 11 of 16 starts
in two years and amassed $10.5 million in prize money, capturing
the 2007  Breeders’ Cup Classic  and the Preakness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
