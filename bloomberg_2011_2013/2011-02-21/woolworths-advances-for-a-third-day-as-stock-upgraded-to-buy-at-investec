Woolworths Holdings Ltd., a South
African food and clothing retailer, climbed for a third day
after Investec Ltd. raised its recommendation on the stock to
“buy” from “hold” and Citigroup Inc. increased its price
estimate.  The stock advanced as much as 2.7 percent to 26.30 rand and
traded 2 percent up at 26.10 rand by 10:09 a.m. in Johannesburg.
A close at that level would be the highest since Jan. 17.  Investec increased its price estimate to 31.60 rand, from
25.56 rand previously. At Citigroup, the price estimate was
increased to 33 rand from 29 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
