  Kobe Bryant  won his record-tying
fourth Most Valuable Player award in front of a home crowd at
the  National Basketball Association ’s All-Star Game, helping the
Western Conference to a 148-143 victory.  Bryant scored a game-high 37 points and added 14 rebounds
against the Eastern Conference last night at the Staples Center
in  Los Angeles , where he’s led the Lakers to the past two NBA
championships.  Bryant joins Hall of Famer Bob Pettit as the only players
to win four All-Star MVP awards. He had been tied at three with  Michael Jordan , Oscar Robertson and  Shaquille O’Neal .  “Being at home I wanted to come out hard and put on a good
show,” Bryant said as he accepted the MVP trophy.  While Bryant helped the West build an early lead they
wouldn’t relinquish, he didn’t score in the final 6:48 as the
Eastern Conference made a late rally, cutting a 17-point fourth-
quarter deficit to two in the final minutes.    LeBron James  of the  Miami Heat  led the East with 29 points,
12 rebounds and 10 assists. Jordan had the only other triple-
double in an All-Star Game in 1997.  “Close but no cigar,” James said in a televised
interview. “It is an All-Star Game, but your competitive nature
and your pride takes over at some point.”  Bryant, who previously won All-Star MVP honors in 2002,
2007 and 2009, scored 11 points in the opening quarter as the
West jumped out to a 37-27 lead.  Scoring Record  Bryant had 21 points at halftime and 34 with 5:03 left in
the third quarter, putting him within striking distance of the
All-Star scoring record of 42 set by Wilt Chamberlain in 1962.
He then scored just three points over the final 17 minutes.  “In the fourth quarter I had nothing left,” Bryant, 32,
said. “I exceeded my dunk quota for the game.”  The East, which trailed 117-100 after three quarters,
fought back as James scored 14 points and Amar’e Stoudemire of
the New York Knicks poured in 15 of his 29 points.  NBA scoring leader  Kevin Durant  of the Oklahoma City
Thunder led the West by scoring 14 points in the final 12
minutes. Durant finished second to Bryant with 34 points.  “I wanted him to get 40, but the old fella kind of tired
out a little bit,” Durant said in a televised interview.  Pau Gasol of the Lakers added 17 points for the West,
including a tip-in of a Bryant miss with 53 seconds left after
the East had pulled within 142-140.  Rookie Blake Griffin of the Los Angeles Clippers, who won
the All-Star slam dunk contest by leaping over a car, scored
eight points for the West. Carmelo Anthony of the  Denver Nuggets 
also had eight points and declined to comment about trade talks
with the Knicks and New Jersey Nets during an in-game interview
with broadcaster TNT.  James’s Heat teammates,  Dwyane Wade  and Chris Bosh,
combined for 28 points, while the  Boston Celtics ’ quartet of
Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce and Rajon Rondo scored 28
between them for the East.  The West still trails 36-24 in the all-time series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
