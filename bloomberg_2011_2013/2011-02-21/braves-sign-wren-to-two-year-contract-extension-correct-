(Corrects spelling of Gonzalez, San Francisco, in second
paragraph.)  Frank Wren agreed on a two-year
extension as general manager of the  Atlanta Braves , keeping him
under contract with the Major League Baseball team through the
2013 season.  The Braves, who announced Wren’s extension in an e-mailed
statement, finished last season with a 91-71 record before being
eliminated from the National League Division Series by the San
Francisco Giants. Atlanta will begin this season under new
manager Fredi Gonzalez. He replaced  Bobby Cox , who retired after
last season following 25 years as the team’s manager.  To contact the editor response ble for this story:
