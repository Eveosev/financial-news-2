  Portugal ’s central government budget
deficit narrowed 58.6 percent in January from the same month
last year.  The budget gap narrowed to 282 million euros, the  Finance
Ministry  said today in an e-mailed statement. Tax revenue
increased 15 percent from a year earlier.  Spending rose 0.9 percent from January 2010, as last year
the budget only took effect in April, the government said.
Without that effect, spending would have dropped 2.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
