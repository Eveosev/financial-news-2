A Turkish Airlines flight sent to
evacuate Turks caught up in unrest in  Libya  returned to Istanbul
after being denied permission to land, Turkey’s state-run news
agency said.  Civil aviation authorities at Benghazi airport refused to
let the plane land, and it circled for an hour in Libyan
airspace before returning to Istanbul airport this morning, the
Anatolia news agency reported.  Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called a meeting
in Ankara last night with authorities from seven organizations
including the military, Transportation Ministry and Turkish Red
Crescent to discuss the situation in Libya and provide security
for Turkish citizens there, Anatolia said. Another evacuation
flight carrying 288 passengers returned from Libya to Istanbul
yesterday, the agency said.    Human Rights Watch  puts the number of people so far killed
in anti-government protests in Libya at more than 200, and said
thousands of demonstrators in Benghazi, the second-biggest city,
were met by gunfire yesterday. Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, son of
longtime leader  Muammar Qaddafi , said the country risked a
“civil war” that would cut off oil supplies from Africa’s
largest holder of crude reserves.  Turkish investments in Libya have almost doubled in the
last two years, to $1.9 billion in 2010 from $1.1 billion in
2008, Anatolia said.  Turkish companies with Libyan operations or partnerships
include  Tekfen Holding AS , a builder, electricity contractor
Anel Elektrik Proje Taahut & Ticaret AS, and lenders  Turkiye Is
Bankasi  AS and state-owned TC Ziraat Bankasi AS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
