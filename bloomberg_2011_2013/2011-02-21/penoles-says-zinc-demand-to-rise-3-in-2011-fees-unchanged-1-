Industrias Penoles SAB,  Mexico ’s
second-largest mining company, expects global demand for zinc to
rise by about 3 percent this year and fees from smelters to stay
unchanged.  “Treatment fees for basic minerals will remain similar to
the previous year,” Fernando Alanis, Penoles’s chief executive
officer, said today in an interview in Cancun. Fees to refine
minerals such as copper will likely increase, he said.  Last year, Penoles’s plants processed about 70 percent of
Mexico’s production of zinc, which is used to galvanize steel.
Macquarie Group Ltd. said Dec. 20. it expected zinc processing
fees, which are paid by miners to smelters to process
concentrates into metal, to fall as much as 20 percent in 2011.  Alanis also said copper is becoming “the metal of choice”
again after new technology increased the capacity of wires made
of the commodity to transmit data. The price will likely be
little changed this year, he said.  Penoles rose 4.5 pesos, or 1.1 percent, to 414.2 pesos at
1:49 p.m. on the Mexican Stock Exchange. The shares have gained
51 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
