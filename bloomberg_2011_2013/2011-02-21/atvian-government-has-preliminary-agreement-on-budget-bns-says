Latviaâ€™s two-party coalition
government reached preliminary agreement on an additional 50
million lati ($97 million) in budget measures to meet the terms
of its international loan, the  Baltic News Service  reported.  The government plans a final agreement tomorrow, Prime
Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said, according to BNS. Finance
Minister Andris Vilks said the measures may contain tax
increases on tobacco and alcohol, the Riga-based newswire
reported.  Latvia turned to a group led by the European Commission and
the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.3
billion) loan in 2008 after its second-biggest bank collapsed.
The Baltic country has raised taxes and reduced expenditures
equal to about 16 percent of gross domestic product since the
program started.  To contact the reporter on this story:
