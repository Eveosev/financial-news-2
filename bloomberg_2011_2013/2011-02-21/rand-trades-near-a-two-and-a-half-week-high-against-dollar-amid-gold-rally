  South Africa ’s rand traded within 1
cent of a 2 1/2-week high against the dollar, as rising prices
for the nation’s biggest commodity exports and overseas
investors’ purchases of the nation’s bonds boosted the currency.  The rand appreciated as much as 0.3 percent to 7.1183 per
dollar, near the 7.1124 reached on Feb. 18, which was the
strongest level since Feb. 2. The currency traded little changed
at 7.1461 by 4:36 p.m. in Johannesburg. Against the euro, the
rand gained 0.2 percent to 9.7643.  Gold rose to a seven-week high as civil unrest in the
Middle East boosted the precious metal’s appeal as a hedge
against market volatility and rising oil prices. Platinum, which
along with bullion accounts for about a fifth of South Africa’s
exports, increased 0.4 percent to $1,851.75.  “A fierce rebound in commodity prices” is boosting the
South African currency, Rand Merchant Bank analysts led by  John Cairns , the investment bank’s Johannesburg-based head of
foreign-exchange research, wrote in a client note today.  South African bonds rose for a seventh consecutive day,
pushing down yields to the lowest in more than a month, as
analysts said the rand’s rebound and the yield advantage of the
securities was luring foreign buyers. South Africa’s benchmark
interest rate of 5.5 percent compares with deposit returns of
0.1 percent in Japan and 0.25 percent in the U.S.  The 13.5 percent security due September 2015 rose 16 cents
to 122.15 rand, reducing the yield by four basis points to 7.66
percent. A close at that level would be the lowest yield for the
bond since Jan. 19.  ‘Bode Well’  “The rebound of the rand against the dollar will bode well
for the bond-market bulls,” Tradition Analytics analysts led by
Quinten Bertenshaw in Johannesburg wrote in a client note today.
“The move, which materialized last week, has helped to drag
yields lower and has been accompanied by a rise in inflows from
foreign investors.”  South African bonds posted their biggest one-week jump in
almost four months last week as the rand’s recovery helped damp
concern inflation may accelerate as global food and fuel prices
rise. The rand gained 1.9 percent in the five days to Feb. 18,
snapping a six-week decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
