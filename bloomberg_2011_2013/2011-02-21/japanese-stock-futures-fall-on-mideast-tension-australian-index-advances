Japanese stock futures fell as
tension escalated in the Middle East, while surging oil and gold
prices boosted Australian commodity-related shares.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,745 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with
10,870 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,750 in  Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time today.  Australia ’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3 percent as gains by commodity-related
shares outweighed broader declines.  Violence in Libya intensified yesterday as the government
attacked protesters and rebels claimed control of the second-
biggest city, Benghazi, after Muammar Qaddafi’s son threatened
“rivers of blood” unless the uprising ends. Oil surged to the
highest price in more than two years in  London  on concern
turmoil in the region will disrupt supplies.  “There’s uncertainty about what’s going on in the Middle
East,” said Yasushi Noguchi, a strategist in Tokyo at SMBC
Friend Securities Co. “Investors will increasingly be taking a
wait-and-see stance.”    BHP Billiton Ltd ., Australia’s biggest oil producer and the
world’s biggest mining company, rose 2.9 percent. Newcrest
Mining Ltd., Australia’s largest gold producer, gained 0.6
percent.    Brent crude  for April settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange climbed yesterday as much as $2.63 to
$105.15 a barrel, the highest since Sept. 25, 2008. Gold climbed
above $1,400 an ounce to the highest price since Jan. 4 in
London. Silver reached a 30-year high.  Japan’s government yesterday raised its assessment of the
economy for a second straight month, citing improved exports and
industrial production. The report said fluctuations in energy
prices could damp the recovery.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6.8 percent by the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 4.1 percent by the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.2
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 14 times for
the S&P 500 and 11.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
