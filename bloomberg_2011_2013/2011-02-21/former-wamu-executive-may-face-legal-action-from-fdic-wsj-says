Former Washington Mutual Bank
executives have received letters from the U.S. Federal Insurance
Deposit Corp. that carry warnings of possible legal action, the
Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter.  The FDIC has considered damages of $1 billion related to the
potential lawsuit, the newspaper said. It isnâ€™t clear which
former executives of the failed bank would be charged, according
to the Journal.  A decision in the matter may be made within 30 days, the
Journal said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
