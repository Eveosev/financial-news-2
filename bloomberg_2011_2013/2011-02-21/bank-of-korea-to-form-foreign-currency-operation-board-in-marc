The Bank of  Korea  plans to create a
foreign-currency operation board next month to ensure greater
autonomy and expertise in managing the world’s sixth-largest
foreign-exchange reserves.  The central bank said in an  e-mailed  statement today it
would outsource the head of the board, its managers and add more
staff.  “The demand for specialty is increasing in the operation
of the reserves,” said Kim Tae Suk, head of the central bank’s
operations team. “We will expand the openness of our resources
in that area.”  At present, 76 bankers are working at the central bank’s
reserve-management department.  “I hear they are re-naming the department that already
exists and making some small changes, which will give them more
independence,” said Stuart Oakley, the Singapore-based head of
emerging-markets foreign exchange for  Asia  at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc.    South Korea ’s foreign-exchange reserves rose to $295.96
billion at the end of January from $291.57 billion a month
earlier, according to official data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
