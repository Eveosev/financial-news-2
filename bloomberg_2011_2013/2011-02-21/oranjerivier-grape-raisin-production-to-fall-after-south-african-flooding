Oranjerivier Wine Cellars , a South
African grape producer and vintner, said its output of wine
grapes will fall about 36 percent this year after floods damaged
vineyards.  The wine-grape harvest will come to about 100,000 metric
tons, Henning Burger, the cooperative’s viticulture manager,
said today by phone. Raisin production at Upington, South
Africa-based Oranjerivier probably will slide by half to 25,000
tons, he said.  “These are just estimates at this stage, as the full
effect of the flooding hasn’t yet been calculated,” Burger
said.  Floods on the Orange River damaged vines in late January
and early February. Heavier-than-normal rains may persist for
months, the South African Weather Department said Jan. 26. The
country is the world’s 10th-largest grape producer, according to
the  United Nations ’  Food and Agriculture Organization .  “We can’t comment on the cost to farmers yet, but it is
very heavy,” Burger said, adding that infrastructure was
damaged as well as crops.  Oranjerivier, started in 1965, is the Southern Hemisphere’s
largest grape-producing cooperative and ranks second worldwide
by harvest size, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
