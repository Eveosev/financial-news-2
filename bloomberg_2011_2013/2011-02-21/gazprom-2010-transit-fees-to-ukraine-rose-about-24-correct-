(Corrects after Gazprom official restates previous years’
gas transit fees throughout.)  OAO Gazprom’s costs for shipping gas
across Ukraine rose by about 24 percent in 2010 from the
previous year, according to Anatoly Podmyshalsky, head of the
Russian export monopoly’s department for relations with the CIS.  Gazprom paid $2.6 billion last year, compared with about
$2.1 billion the year before and $1.2 billion in the 1990s,
Podmyshalsky said today at a round table on energy in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
