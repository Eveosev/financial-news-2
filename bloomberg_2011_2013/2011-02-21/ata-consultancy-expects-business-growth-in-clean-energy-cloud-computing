  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd .,
Asia’s largest information-services provider, will increase its
focus on renewable-energy technologies and cloud computing, the
company’s global head of venture capital said.  “These are the growth engines of the future,” Ajoy Mallik
said in an interview in Tel Aviv, where he was attending a
Landmark Ventures business conference. Mallik named wind, water,
biomass and fuel cells as technologies he plans to investigate.  “I am hoping to get new ideas in Israel,” he said.
Mallik, who also heads the co-innovation ecosystem initiative at
the Indian company, is based in  Santa Clara , California.  The International Energy Agency  said last year that global
subsidies for clean and low-carbon energy totaled $57 billion in
2009. HSBC Holdings Plc in that year estimated that world
governments had allocated about $521 billion over five years in
so-called green stimulus spending as they tried to promote more
efficient industries in the wake of the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
