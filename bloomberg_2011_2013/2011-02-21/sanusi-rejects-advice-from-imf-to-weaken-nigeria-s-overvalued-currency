  Nigeria ’s central bank Governor
Lamido Sanusi rejected advice by the  International Monetary Fund 
to weaken the naira, saying the currency isn’t overvalued.  With  oil prices  rising, the currency shouldn’t be “losing
its value,” Sanusi said in a televised interview with CNBC
Africa today. The IMF’s advice “is not based on sound economic
logic.”  The naira is overvalued and more exchange-rate flexibility
is needed to prevent the central bank from running down foreign-
currency reserves to maintain the rate at about 150 to the
dollar, the IMF said in a statement on Feb. 17. The central
bank’s “accommodative” monetary policy and rising government
spending contributed to high inflation, the IMF said.  “There’s a limit to how much the central bank can do,”
Sanusi said. The bank didn’t want to “add to the crisis by
tightening liquidity” and has now done so as conditions in the
banking industry improved.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  raised the benchmark interest
rate by a quarter point to 6.5 percent on Jan. 25 to head off
price pressures as fiscal spending increased before elections in
April.  Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer and most populous
nation, and has the continent’s third-largest economy after  South Africa  and Egypt. Economic growth will probably slow to 7
percent in 2011 from 8.4 percent last year, the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
