  Taiwan ’s export orders rose less
than estimated in January, signaling that an appreciation in the
island’s currency may crimp trade gains.  Orders, an indication of shipments in the next one to three
months, climbed 13.47 percent from a year earlier, after a 15.27
percent gain in December, the  Ministry of Economic Affairs  said
in Taipei today. The median estimate of 13 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an 18.5 percent increase.  The  Taiwan dollar ’s advance of about 8.9 percent against
its U.S. counterpart in the past six months, the most in  Asia ,
threatens export competitiveness. The central bank raised its
benchmark interest rate three times in 2010 to damp price
pressures, while stepping up efforts to counter foreign capital
inflows driving up the island’s currency.  “A lower-than-expected figure may be just a hiccup, and it
doesn’t change the course of a steady recovery in the economy,”
Aidan Wang, an economist at Yuanta Securities Investment
Consulting Co. in Taipei, said before the release. Policy makers
are set to raise borrowing costs 0.125 percentage point to 1.75
percent next month, and to 2.125 percent by the end of this year,
he said.  The Taiwan dollar climbed 0.1 percent to NT$29.366 against
its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. The Taiex stock index closed down 0.1 percent before
the release.  Order Value  Exports account for about two-thirds of the economy and
have boosted revenue at companies including Taoyuan-based  HTC
Corp ., a maker of handsets using Google Inc.’s and Microsoft
Corp.’s operating systems.  The value of export orders declined to $34.46 billion last
month from a record $36.57 billion in December, today’s report
showed. The economic affairs ministry said their value will fall
further from January’s level.  Export orders from  China  and  Hong Kong  combined increased
7.22 percent from a year earlier, after rising 17.63 percent in
December. Purchases from the U.S. climbed 17.97 percent,
compared with a 10.5 percent gain in December.  Orders for electronics rose 9.85 percent in January,
following a 17.07 percent increase in December. Demand for
information technology and communications products climbed 6.83
percent last month, after advancing 8.95 percent in December.  Taiwan’s current-account surplus widened in the fourth
quarter, a separate report showed today. The surplus was $10.1
billion in the three months through December, compared with a
revised $9.06 billion in the third quarter.  The economy expanded 10.82 percent in 2010, the government
said last week, one of the world’s highest rates based on
International Monetary Fund estimates. The administration
forecast growth of 4.92 percent this year and projected
inflation will climb to 2 percent from 2010’s 0.96 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
