Nokia Siemens Networks Chief
Executive Officer Rajeev Suri said the joint venture of  Nokia
Oyj  and  Siemens AG  is in talks with “a few” private equity
firms.  Benefits of adding another owner would include new capital
for “strategic flexibility” and “expertise and knowledge”
including advice on purchases to round out the company’s
portfolio, Suri told reporters in Espoo, Finland today.  Interest from private equity firms doesn’t imply a
rejection by the parent companies, Suri said. He didn’t comment
on the timetable for talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
