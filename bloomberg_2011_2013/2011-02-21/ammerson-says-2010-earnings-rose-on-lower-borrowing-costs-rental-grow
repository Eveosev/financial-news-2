  Hammerson Plc , Britain’s third-
largest real estate investment trust, said profit excluding
items rose 12 percent last year as borrowing costs dropped and
rents increased. The shares rose to a 27-month high.  Earnings excluding changes in asset values advanced to
140.2 million pounds ($228 million), or 19.9 pence a share, from
125.3 million pounds, or 19.7 pence, a year earlier, the London-
based company said today in a statement. That beat 19.5 pence a
share, the median of 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer David Atkins raised 555 million
pounds from the sale of buildings with limited potential to
increase profit or rental income, using the proceeds to fund
acquisitions and development projects. Rental income generated
by properties owned throughout last year increased 3.5 percent
and acquisitions added further revenue from leasing.  “This is a good set of results,” said Robert Duncan, an
analyst at Nomura International in  London  with a “buy”
recommendation on the shares. Net asset value exceeded Duncan’s
prediction by 3 percent.  Hammerson advanced 7.7 pence, or 1.7 percent, to 455.2
pence in London trading, lifting the value of the company to 3.2
billion pounds. It was the highest closing share price since
Nov. 10, 2008.  Financing costs fell 14 percent to 111.5 million pounds
last year as the company reduced its net debt by about 300
million pounds to 1.8 billion pounds. Hammerson’s average
borrowing rate was 5 percent, down from 5.10 percent in the
preceding 18 months.  Debt Falls  Rising property values and efforts to reduce borrowing
lowered Hammerson’s debt to 52 percent of the value of its real
estate, compared with 72 percent a year earlier.  Gains in the value of its real estate added 447 million
pounds to profit last year. Net income was 615.4 million pounds
compared with a loss of 344.5 million pounds a year earlier. Net
asset value rose 9 percent to 4.95 pounds a share in the six
months through December.  Hammerson said it will pay a second-half dividend of 8.8
pence a share, taking the total for 2010 to 15.95 pence. That
compares with the 15.45 pence paid for 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
