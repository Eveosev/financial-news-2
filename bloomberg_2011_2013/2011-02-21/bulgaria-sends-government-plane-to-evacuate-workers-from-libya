Bulgaria will send a government
airplane to  Libya  to pick up Bulgarians who want to leave the
North African country as violence there worsens.  The planeâ€™s crew is awaiting permission to land in the
capital, Tripoli, the Bulgarian government said in an e-mailed
statement. Some 1,500 Bulgarian doctors, nurses and engineers
work in Libya, according to the Foreign Ministry. The plane will
make as many trips as needed to evacuate all who wish to leave.  Violence escalated in Libya today amid reports protesters
seized control of the second biggest city, Benghazi, in an
effort to topple Muammar Qaddafi, who has ruled the country for
41 years.  Five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who had been
sentenced to death were freed in 2007 after eight years in a
Libyan prison with the help of the European Union.  To contact the reporter of this story:
