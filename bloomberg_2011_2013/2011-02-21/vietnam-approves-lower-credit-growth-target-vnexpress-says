  Vietnam ’s Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung approved lowering the 2011 credit growth target to 20
percent to stabilize the economy and curb inflation, online
newswire VnExpress said today, citing the central bank governor.  The target for credit expansion was reduced from 23 percent,
Governor Nguyen Van Giau was cited as saying on Feb. 20. The
prime minister may even allow setting a goal of less than 20
percent if necessary, the report cited Giau as saying.  Giau didn’t answer three calls made to his mobile phone by
