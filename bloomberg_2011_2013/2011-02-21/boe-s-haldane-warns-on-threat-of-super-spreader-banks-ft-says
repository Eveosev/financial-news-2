Regulators should get the largest,
most complex and interconnected banks to hold higher levels of
capital to prevent them spreading contagion in the event of a
financial crisis, Bank of England official Andrew Haldane and
U.K. scientist Robert May wrote in the Financial Times.  Policy makers should target these so-called “super-
spreader” banks as analysis of how infectious diseases spread
shows that would help to improve the stability of an entire
financial system, they said in an article published in the
newspaper today.  “Rather than seeking to equalise the probability of
failure across institutions -- irrespective of size --
regulation would seek to equalise each bank’s contribution to
systemic risk,” Haldane and May said. “Size and complexity
increase the changes of cross-contamination of the whole barrel,
even if there is only one bad apple.”  Haldane is the Bank of England’s executive director for
financial stability, while May is currently a Zoology professor
at Oxford University and one of the scientists from whom
Governor  Mervyn King  has sought advice on how science can
provide clues to improving the banking system. Haldane and May
co-wrote a paper on the topic which was published in the journal
Nature last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Scott Hamilton  in London at
