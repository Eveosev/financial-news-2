South African farmers have agreed a
deal to cultivate about 172,000 hectares (425,021 acres) of land
in the Republic of Congo,  Reuters  reported, citing Theo de
Jager, deputy president of AgriSA, an agricultural group.  The farmers will lease the land for 105 years, the news
agency said. AgriSA has postponed further talks about similar
agreements in  Egypt ,  Morocco ,  Libya  and  Tunisia  because of
political unrest in North Africa, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
