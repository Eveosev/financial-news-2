The Polish zloty weakened for a
second day after central bank Governor Marek Belka said policy
makers should be “moderate” in their response to accelerating
inflation.  The zloty depreciated 0.3 percent to 3.9302 per euro as of
12:41 p.m. in Warsaw, making it the third-worst performer among
more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
Two-year bond prices rose, pushing the yield on notes maturing
in January 2013 down 1 basis point to 5.15 percent.  Monetary policy makers’ decision to lift  interest rates  in
January doesn’t automatically mean a “cascade” of increases
will follow in coming months as the faster pace of inflation is
caused by external shocks such as higher commodity prices, Belka
said in an interview published today by the Warsaw-based
Narodowy Bank Polski’s obserwatorfinansowy.pl website.  The statement suggesting that “the monetary policy
tightening doesn’t have to be continued in the coming months has
weakened the zloty by as much as one grosz,” Bank Millennium
economists led by Grzegorz Maliszewski in Warsaw wrote in a note
to clients. One grosz is 0.01 of a zloty.  The inflation rate jumped to 3.8 percent in January, the
highest in 21 months, exceeding the central bank’s 3.5 percent
tolerance limit. Policy makers last month increased borrowing
costs for the first time since June 2008, lifting the benchmark
interest rate to 3.75 percent from a record-low 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
