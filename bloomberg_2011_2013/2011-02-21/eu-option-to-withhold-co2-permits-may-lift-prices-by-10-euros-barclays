The European Union option of setting
aside as many as 800 million surplus carbon allowances is
“unwelcome” regulation that may add 10 euros ($13.66) a ton to
prices in 2013,  Barclays Plc  said.  The EU carbon market, where benchmark prices are up 14
percent from a year ago, has an oversupply of about 460 million
allowances for the five years through 2012, analysts led by  Trevor Sikorski  at the Barclays Capital investment bank in
London said today in an e-mailed note. Power utilities will need
much of that extra supply to hedge their forward sales of
electricity over the next few years, they said.  Removing some permits and setting them aside as indicated
in a leaked EU planning document would probably mean a “tight
market, greater price volatility and an almighty scramble for
allowances,” Sikorski said. The bank forecast on Feb. 14 that
EU prices will be 30 euros a metric ton in 2013. A 10 euro jump
would represent a surge of 33 percent.  EU carbon for December rose 0.6 percent to 15.08 euros a
metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London  as of
2:20 p.m. It traded earlier today as high as 15.14 euros a ton,
the most since Feb. 3.  The EU’s consideration of withholding permits has “some
deeply disturbing elements,” Sikorski said. It indicates the
Brussels-based European Commission is seeking to manipulate
rules to bring about desired prices, he said.  “Such behavior is the opposite of what is required to
instill the market with certainty, and such proposals do leave
participants wondering just how to value carbon,” he said.  The proposal has insufficient detail and seems to work
around lawmakers’ preference to keep the bloc’s emissions target
at 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 rather than increasing
it, Barclays said. “All in all, the incident is an unwelcome
regulatory intervention into the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
