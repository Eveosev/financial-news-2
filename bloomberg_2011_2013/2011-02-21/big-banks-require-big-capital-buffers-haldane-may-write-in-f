The Basel-based Financial Stability
Board is right to demand that big, complex banks hold larger
capital buffers, said Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England’s
financial stability director, and Robert May, a zoology
professor at Oxford University and a former chief scientific
adviser to the U.K. government.  Writing in the Financial Times, Haldane and May argue that
scaling up risks in complex systems may cause them to cascade
rather than cancel each other out, because size and complexity
increase chances of cross-contamination.  History offers no evidence that big, complex banks are less
likely to fail than smaller ones, but even if it did, there
would still be a strong case for big banks holding higher levels
of loss-absorbing capital, because of their system-wide impact,
Haldane and May said.  Epidemiology teaches that the optimal strategy for
preventing the spread of disease is to concentrate on “super-
spreaders,” that is, not those most likely to die, but those
with the greatest capacity to infect counterparties, they said.  Big, complex banks are the super-spreaders of the financial
world, with “mind-boggling” numbers of counterparties; when
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed it had more than 1
million such relationships, Haldane and May said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
