The following companies had unusual
price changes in Sao Paulo trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:15 p.m. New York time.
Preferred shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index fell 1.2 percent to 67,258.66.    Embraer SA  (EMBR3 BS) lost 1.2 percent to 14.13 reais.
Defense budget cuts will reduce funding for KC-390 military
transport planes being developed by Embraer, Folha de S.Paulo
reported, citing an interview with Brazil Air Force Commander
Juniti Saito. The air unit will also reduce funding for the
modernization of its AMX fighter planes, another project
involving Embraer, the newspaper said, citing Saito.  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3 BS) jumped 3.8
percent to 18.80 reais. Crude surged to the highest in more than
two years in London. Separately, Maersk Oil, a division of A.P.
Moeller-Maersk A/S and partner OGX, the oil company controlled
by billionaire Eike Batista, found crude in the Carambola B
exploration well offshore  Brazil , Maersk said on its website.
Maersk Oil is the operator and has a 50 percent share of the
block.  Homebuilders fell after an increase in inflation forecasts
spurred traders to boost bets for higher interest rates. PDG
Realty SA Empreendimentos & Participacoes (PDGR3 BS) helped lead
declines, slipping 3.1 percent to 9.30 reais.    Tam SA  (TAMM4 BS) fell 3.1 percent to 35.30 reais while  Gol
Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA  (GOLL4 BS) dropped 3.7 percent to
22.16 reais. Rising oil prices are sparking concern costs will
rise for Brazilâ€™s two largest airlines, said Rosangela Ribeiro,
an analyst at SLW Corretora brokerage in Sao Paulo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
