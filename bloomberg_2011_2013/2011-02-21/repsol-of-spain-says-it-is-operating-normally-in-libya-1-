  Repsol YPF SA ,  Spain ’s biggest oil
company, is operating normally in Libya and isn’t withdrawing
staff, said Kristian Rix, a spokesman for the Madrid-based
company.  Repsol, which has exploration and production activities in
Libya, has been present in that North African country since the
1970s, according to the Spanish oil company’s website. Repsol
had net production in Libya of 34,777 barrels a day in 2009,
about 3.8 percent of the company’s global output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
