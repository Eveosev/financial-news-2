The dollar may reverse last week’s
decline and rally 6 percent to its December high against the
Swiss franc, Commerzbank AG said, citing technical indicators.  “Longer-term, we target 1.0067” Swiss francs per dollar,  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and currency
technical analysis at Commerzbank in London, wrote in a report
today. The  exchange rate  reached that level on Dec. 1.  The dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to 94.78 Swiss centimes
at 12:30 p.m. today in London. The greenback slumped almost 3
percent against the franc last week and sank to 94.25 earlier
today, the weakest level since Feb. 3, Bloomberg data show.  “We would allow the slide to continue to 0.9425, from
where we would favor recovery,” Jones wrote. That’s the 78.6
percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally seen in February,
Jones wrote.  The dollar may test resistance at around 97.74 centimes,
she said. Those levels represent the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the move down from December and the high from
Jan. 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Resistance and support levels are areas on a chart where
technical analysts anticipate orders to sell or buy,
respectively, a currency and its related instruments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
