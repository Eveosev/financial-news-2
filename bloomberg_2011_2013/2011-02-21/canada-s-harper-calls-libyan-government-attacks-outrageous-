Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper urged the Libyan government to stop its attacks on
protesters at once after violence escalated in the North African
country.  “We find the actions of the government, firing upon its
own citizens, to be outrageous and unacceptable,” Harper told a
televised press conference in  Vancouver  today. “We call on the
government to cease this kind of violence immediately.”  Libya’s government today attacked protesters and rebels
claimed control of the second-biggest city, Benghazi, after
Muammar Qaddafi’s son threatened “rivers of blood” unless the
uprising ends.    Canada  today advised its citizens to avoid any non-
essential travel to Libya.  To contact the reporter for this story:
