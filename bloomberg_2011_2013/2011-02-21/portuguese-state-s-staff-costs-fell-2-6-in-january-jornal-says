The Portuguese state’s spending on
staff fell 2.6 percent in January, Jornal de Negocios reported,
citing Emanuel dos Santos, the secretary of state for the
budget.  Staff spending by autonomous funds and services declined
3.5 percent last month, the Portuguese newspaper said.  There is a “high” probability that the 2010  budget
deficit  was less than 7 percent of gross domestic product,
Santos said, according to Jornal de Negocios.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
