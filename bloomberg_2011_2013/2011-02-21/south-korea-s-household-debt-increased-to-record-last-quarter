  South Korea ’s  household debt  rose
for a seventh straight quarter in the final three months of 2010
as mortgage lending gained and a strengthening economy
encouraged consumers to spend more on credit cards.  Household credit, the sum of loans and credit purchases,
climbed 25.3 trillion won ($22.7 billion) to 795.4 trillion won
in the three months ended Dec. 31 from the previous quarter, the
Bank of Korea said in  Seoul  today. That was the biggest gain in
won terms since the third quarter of 2002. From a year earlier,
household debt gained 8.4 percent.  Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo unexpectedly left
interest rates unchanged this month, signaling an increase may
wait until next month. While higher borrowing costs could help
contain inflation, they may strain debt-bearing households,
small businesses and low-income earners.  Kim’s policy board raised the benchmark interest rate by a
quarter percentage point each in July, November and January from
a record-low 2 percent, joining counterparts from China and  India  in tightening monetary policy to fight inflation as  Asia 
leads the global recovery.  Asia’s fourth-largest economy expanded 6.1 percent in 2010
from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2002. Inflation
quickened to 4.1 percent in January from 3.5 percent in December,
exceeding the central bank’s target of 2 percent to 4 percent
through 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
