European Union carbon allowances for
December rose to their highest price since Feb. 3 as 2012 German
power advanced, boosting the incentive to sell electricity in
forward markets, and crude oil increased on Middle East unrest.  EU carbon increased as much as 0.7 percent to 15.09 euros
($20.67) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London  and were at 15.05 euros as of 8:40 a.m. The current price
would be the highest close since Dec. 7. German power for next
year rose 0.6 percent to 53.05 euros a megawatt hour, according
to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
