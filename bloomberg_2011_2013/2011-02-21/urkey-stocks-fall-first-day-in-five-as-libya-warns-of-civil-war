Turkish stocks retreated for the
first day in five as escalating tensions in Libya sent
construction companies and bank stocks lower.  The  ISE National 100 Index  of stocks fell 1.3 percent to
65,129 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul. The yield on two-year
bonds rose 15 basis points to 8.48 percent, its highest in more
than a week, according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index.  “Economic implications of the recent unrest in Libya and
other Arab states are bad news for contractors operating in
these high-risk countries,” Oyak Securities wrote in a note to
clients today.  Turkish companies have $15.3 billion in Libyan contracts,
Trade Minister Zafer Caglayan said at a news conference in
Ankara today. Exports from  Turkey  to Libya have almost doubled
in the last two years, the state-run news agency Anatolia said.
Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, Muammar Qaddafi’s son, called on
protesters in Libya to engage in dialogue or face a civil war,
saying “rivers of blood will flow” with a widening revolt.  Human Rights Watch  puts the number dead at more than 200.    Tekfen Holding AS , which has  construction projects  in
Libya, slumped to its lowest in more than four months, falling
7.9 percent to 5.86 liras. Tekfen has $140 million in unfinished
contracted work in the country and the company’s priority now is
the safe evacuation of 1,197 non-Libyan employees, it said in a
statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange . Akfen Holding AS, co-
owner of TAV Havalimanlari Holding AS, which is building
 airports  in Libya, fell 4.8 percent to 10.95 liras.  The lira weakened 0.5 percent to 1.5861 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
