Duke University  returned to the top
spot in the Associated Press college basketball poll, where  St.
John’s University  is included for the first time in 11 years
after beating its fifth ranked opponent of the season.  The Blue Devils (25-2) received 35 of the 65 first-place
votes in the media poll, passing the previous week’s top four
teams, all of which lost in the past week. Duke, the defending
national champion, was ranked No. 1 in the AP poll earlier in
the season.    St. John’s , which beat Duke on Jan. 30, is ranked No. 23.  Duke has the nation’s seventh-ranked scoring offense, led
by senior guard Nolan Smith, who is averaging 21.7 points and
5.3 assists per game. The Blue Devils beat all three teams that
were ranked at the time they played this season and have won 34
consecutive games in Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham,  North
Carolina , the longest home winning streak in the country.  St. John’s (17-9) beat then-No. 4 Pittsburgh 60-59 at
Madison Square Garden in  New York  two days ago. The Red Storm
previously had home wins over the  University of Notre Dame , then
ranked No. 9; Duke, then No. 3; the University of  Connecticut ,
then No. 10; and Georgetown University, then No. 13.  St. John’s enters the AP Top 25 for the first time since
Nov. 28, 2000. The Red Storm have won four in a row and are 9-5
in the Big East, tied for fourth in the conference.  Kansas (25-2) held the top spot for one week, and fell to
No. 3 this week after losing to Kansas State on Feb. 14. The
rest of last week’s top four -- No. 2 Ohio State (25-2), No. 3  Texas  (23-4) and No. 4 Pittsburgh (24-3) -- lost this weekend.
It is the first time since 2003 that the top four teams in the
AP poll all lost in the same week.  Ohio State,  Kansas , Pittsburgh and Texas follow Duke in
this week’s AP top five.  Duke is also No. 1 in the ESPN/USA Today poll, voted on by
a panel of 31 Division I coaches. The poll has St. John’s 25th.  To contact the reporter on this story:
