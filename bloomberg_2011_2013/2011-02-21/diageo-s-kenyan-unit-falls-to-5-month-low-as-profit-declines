  Diageo Plc ’s Kenyan unit,  East
African Breweries Ltd ., fell to the lowest level in more than
five months after saying first-half profit declined 8.6 percent
as costs at its operations in neighboring Uganda increased..  The stock dropped 7 shillings, or 3.7 percent, to 182
shillings by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the lowest closing
level since Sept. 13.  Net income dropped to 3.19 billion shillings ($39.2
million) in the six months through December, from 3.49 billion
shillings a year earlier, Nairobi-based EABL said in a statement
distributed by the city’s stock exchange on Feb. 18.
Administrative expenses jumped 28 percent to 2.7 billion
shillings, it said.  Last year, the company completed the acquisition of 51
percent of Serengeti Breweries Ltd. in Tanzania for $60.4
million. In Uganda, the company installed a new bottling plant
at its  Uganda  Breweries Ltd. unit and spent more on marketing
and distribution, Managing Director Seni Adetu said on Feb. 18.  “The flat first-half performance points to a more subdued
second half as its Uganda subsidiary continues to post poor
results,” George Bodo an analyst at Nairobi-based Genghis
Capital, said in an phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
