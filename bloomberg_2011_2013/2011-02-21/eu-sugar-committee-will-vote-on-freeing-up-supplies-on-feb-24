The European Union’s sugar
management committee plans to vote Feb. 24 on a proposal to
allow more sugar imports and the sale of so-called out-of-quota
sweetener on the domestic market.  The plans were announced by EU farm Commissioner Dacian
Ciolos to EU farm ministers meeting in Brussels today, European
Commission spokesman Roger Waite said by phone today. The sugar
management committee oversees the internal sugar market and
subsidies for production and its decisions are then passed for
approval to the commission, the EU’s executive arm.  Under EU rules, local sugar producers can sell a limited
quantity for food use in the 27-nation bloc. The commission is
proposing to scrap a levy on 500,000 metric tons of out-of-quota
sugar and allow it to be sold in the EU, Waite said by e-mail
today. The commission is also proposing a tender system that
will allow for additional sugar imports, he said.  “Refiners and sugar users in parts of  Europe  have genuine
problems with access to supplies of sugar at the moment, and the
commission is therefore keen to respond, using the tools
available to us,” Waite said.  The EU sugar market has “tightened considerably” and
companies are having difficulty finding supplies of the
sweetener, the  Association of the German Confectionery Industry 
said Feb. 18.  “Our companies have a supply problem with sugar,”
Managing Director Torben Erbrath said that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
