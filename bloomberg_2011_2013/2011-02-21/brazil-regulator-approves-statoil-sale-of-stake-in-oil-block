Brazil’s oil regulator approved  Statoil ASA ’s request to sell a 40 percent stake in the Velho
Barreiro oil field to state-run  Petroleo Brasileiro SA ,
according to the agency’s website.  Statoil and Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer
is known, divided the BM-J-3 exploration block into two areas,
Velho Barreiro and Lua Nova, and Statoil will keep its stake in
the Lua Nova discovery, Statoil’s press office said today in an
e-mailed statement.  The two fields are in the Jequitinhonha basin in deep
waters off the coast of northern Brazil. Petrobras now owns 100
percent of Velho Barreiro, and operates Lua Nova with a 60
percent stake, according to minutes on the website of  Brazil ’s
regulator, known as ANP. Petrobras discovered the Velho Barreiro
field in 2009 and Lua Nova in 2008, according to ANP.  Velho Barreiro is Statoil’s second Brazil sale in less than
a year. In May, Statoil, Norway’s largest oil and natural gas
company, agreed to sell a 40 percent stake in the Peregrino
offshore field to  China ’s Sinochem Group for $3.05 billion.  Norway’s Statoil didn’t provide any details on the terms of
the Velho Barreiro sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
