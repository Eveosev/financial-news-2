Elisabeth Guertler, head of Vienna’s
Sacher hotel, may make a takeover bid for stakes in three luxury
hotels in Vienna and Salzburg, Wirtschaftsblatt reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  B&C Holding owns 52.1 percent of the Imperial hotel group,
which consists of the Imperial and Bristol hotels in Vienna and
Hotel Goldener Hirsch in Salzburg, the Vienna-based newspaper
said. The stake may be worth about 90 million euros ($123
million), according to the report.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
