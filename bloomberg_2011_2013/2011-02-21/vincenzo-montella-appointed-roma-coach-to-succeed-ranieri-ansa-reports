Italian soccer team Roma named
Vincenzo Montella as coach until the end of the season,
replacing Claudio Ranieri who quit after yesterday’s 4-3 defeat
at Genoa.  The club confirmed the appointment in an announcement
through the Italian stock exchange.  Previously a youth coach at the club, ex-Italian national
team striker Montella, 36, had stints as a player with teams
including Empoli, Genoa and Roma. He also had a loan spell with
London team Fulham in 2007.  Roma said it’s “certain that with his enthusiasm and
dedication he’ll be able to help the squad with his quality,
professionalism and experience.”  The team is in eighth place in Serie A after yesterday’s
defeat, when Genoa rallied from 3-0 down.  Earlier today, the club said former Chelsea and Valencia
coach Ranieri resigned and his contract was resolved by mutual
consent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
