  Indonesia ’s rupiah rose, trading
near the strongest level in more than three years on speculation
the central bank will raise  interest rates  when it reviews
monetary policy next month.  The currency rose for a fifth consecutive day after
exchange data showed global funds bought $274 million more
Indonesian shares than they sold last week. The rupiah has
advanced 1.6 percent since Feb. 4, when  Bank Indonesia  raised
its benchmark  reference rate  to 6.75 percent from a record-low
6.50 percent after inflation accelerated in January.  “Bank Indonesia is expected to raise interest rates in
March by 25 basis points,” said Joanna Tan, a Singapore-based
regional economist at Forecast Singapore Pte. “The fund inflows
into stocks are also an indication of improved investor
sentiment.”  The rupiah appreciated 0.1 percent to 8,848 per dollar as
of 3:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 8,828, the strongest level since June 2007.  Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy rose
7.02 percent last month from a year earlier after having
increased 6.96 percent in December, according to official data.  Government bonds were unchanged, with the yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 at 8.8 percent, the same as at the
end of last week, according to midday prices by the Inter-Dealer
Market Association.  Overseas funds have increased their holdings of Indonesian
government debt to 198 trillion rupiah ($22.4 billion) as of Feb.
17, from 195 trillion rupiah by the end of January, according to
the finance ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
