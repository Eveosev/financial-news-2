Japan has created a secret foreign
spy network for the first time since World War II to gather
information on  North Korea  and  China , the Canberra Times  said ,
citing WikiLeaks, an organization that publishes secret
documents on its website.  The unit has been set up under the Cabinet Information and
Research Office, Japan’s intelligence agency, according to a
leaked U.S. State Department cable, the Times said. It is
modeled on networks such as the Central Intelligence Agency and
Britain’s MI6, the story said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
