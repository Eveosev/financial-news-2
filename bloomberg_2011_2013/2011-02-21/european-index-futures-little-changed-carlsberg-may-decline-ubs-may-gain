European stocks declined as
investors speculated that the unrest in Libya will cause energy
prices to climb, fueling inflation and curbing economic growth.    Eni SpA  and  OMV AG  both lost more than 4 percent amid
speculation that the Libyan revolts will hinder the companies’
operations in the North African country. Merck KGaA advanced 4.5
percent as fourth-quarter earnings beat estimates. Alpha Bank SA
soared 5 percent after the lender rejected an offer from  National Bank of Greece SA .  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.3 percent to 287.18 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the gauge’s largest drop in a
month. Even so, the gauge has advanced 4.1 percent since the
start of 2011 as investors bet that a stronger economic recovery
will boost corporate earnings.  “The political unrest in the Middle East appears to be
getting worse and spreading to other countries,” said Gregor Smith, a  fund manager  at Daiwa Asset Management in  London  who
helps oversee about $1 billion. “It could push up the oil
price. It would obviously have a negative impact for inflation,
and could cause economic growth to be weaker than expected.”  Futures contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
expiring in March slid 0.9 percent today. U.S. financial markets
are shut for a holiday.  Fifty-six percent of the Stoxx 600 companies that have
reported per-share profit since Jan. 10 have topped analysts’
estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rising
profits have held the gauge at about 15 times the reported
earnings of its companies, less than the average for the past
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge reached
its highest level since August 2008 on Feb. 17.  European Stocks Slide  National benchmark indexes retreated in all but one of the
18 western European markets today. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index 
lost 1.1 percent, while Germany’s  DAX Index  and France’s  CAC 40
Index  both declined 1.4 percent. Italy’s FTSE MIB was the worst
performing European market, slumping 3.6 percent, the largest
decline in more than seven months.  Stocks extended their losses after Muammar Qaddafi’s son
called on protesters in Libya to begin a dialogue or face a
civil war, risking the country’s oil wealth.  “Instead of weeping over 84 dead people, we will weep over
hundreds of thousands of dead,” Saif al-Islam Qaddafi said on
state television. “Rivers of blood will flow.”  Eni, the international  oil company  with the largest
presence in Libya, dropped 5.1 percent to 17.43 euros in Milan
for the biggest decline in 18 months as investors speculated
that the government’s attacks on demonstrators will disrupt
production in the North African country. OMV, which also
operates in Libya, sank 4.2 percent to 32.57 euros.  TNT, CSR Decrease    TNT NV  lost 2.5 percent to 19.94 euros as full-year net
income missed analysts’ estimates.    CSR Plc  slumped 9.7 percent to 392 pence after the London-
based wireless-technology producer said it will buy Zoran Corp.
of the U.S., which specializes in imaging technology, for $679
million. CSR will return as much as $240 million to investors in
a share buyback program.    JJB Sports Plc , the unprofitable U.K. sporting goods
retailer, sank 17 percent to 31.5 pence after raising 31.5
million pounds ($51.1 million) in a share sale.  Merck advanced 4.5 percent to 65.50 euros after the
drugmaker reported core earnings, excluding costs such as
writedowns and merger expenses, of 1.78 euros a share, beating
the average estimate of 1.49 euros from 16 analysts surveyed
within the past 28 days by Bloomberg. Merck said fourth-quarter
profit fell 18 percent as sales, administration and marketing
costs rose because of its acquisition of Millipore Corp. last
year.  Alpha Bank, Hammerson  Alpha Bank soared 5 percent to 5.03 euros after the shares
resumed trading today. Greece’s third-biggest bank rejected an
unsolicited 2.8 billion-euro ($3.8 billion) takeover bid from
National Bank of  Greece  on Feb. 18. Alpha called the offer
inadequate.    Hammerson Plc  advanced 1.7 percent to 455.2 pence after
saying full-year earnings, excluding changes in asset values,
increased to 140.2 million pounds from 125.3 million pounds a
year earlier.    Invensys Plc  jumped 3.7 percent to 357.8 pence after the
Observer newspaper reported that several engineering companies
may bid for the British manufacturing company. Honeywell
International Inc., Emerson Electric Co., ABB Ltd., Alstom SA,
Siemens AG, and the Chinese companies CSR and CNR have
considered buying Invensys, the newspaper reported, citing
unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
