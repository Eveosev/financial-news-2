U.S. stocks tumbled, dragging the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its biggest decline since August,
as violence escalated in Libya and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc . reported
sales that trailed its own forecasts.  Wal-Mart fell 3.1 percent, the most since May 20.  Bank of
America Corp . retreated 3.9 percent after almost doubling a
writedown for its credit-card unit to $20.3 billion. Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. slumped 4.9 percent as copper fell
the most in three months amid concern that surging oil costs may
slow economic growth.  Exxon Mobil Corp . and  Chevron Corp .
rallied as Middle East tensions sent oil to a two-year high.  The S&P 500 declined 2.1 percent to 1,315.44 at 4 p.m. in
New York, its biggest drop since Aug. 11. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  retreated 178.46 points, or 1.4 percent, to
12,212.79, snapping a three-day rally. The Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index, which measures the cost of using
options as insurance against declines in the  S&P 500 , soared 27
percent to 20.80, the biggest advance since May 20.  “The market is extremely vulnerable to the kind of global
risk we’re seeing now,” said Tom Mangan, who helps oversee $2.5
billion as a money manager at James Investment Research Inc. in
Xenia, Ohio. “If the violence in Libya turns into a prolonged
civil war, it will increase the risk that oil supplies could be
disrupted. This could be the catalyst that starts the 5 percent
to 10 percent correction.”  Eight Straight Quarters  The S&P 500 had risen for three straight weeks, reaching
the highest level since June 2008 on Feb. 18,  as reports showed
an improving economy and corporate profits beat analysts’
estimates for the eighth straight quarter, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Per-share earnings at 71 percent of the
409 companies in the S&P 500 that reported results since Jan. 10
topped the average projection, Bloomberg data show.  Crude oil prices in New York jumped 8.6 percent from the
Feb. 18 settlement to $93.57 a barrel as soldiers deserted
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s government.  Libya , the holder of
Africa’s largest oil reserves, is the latest country in the
region to be convulsed by protests ignited by the ouster of
Tunisia’s president last month and energized by the departure of
Egypt’s President Hosni Mubarak on Feb. 11.  Stocks slumped from Hong Kong and  London  to Sao Paulo as
Qaddafi said he hasn’t fled the country, after government forces
attacked protesters and rebels claimed control of Benghazi,
Libya’s second-largest city. Qaddafi’s crackdown on a weeklong
uprising has already left more than 200 dead, according to Human
Rights Watch. Qaddafi’s son, Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, earlier
threatened that “rivers of blood” would flow unless the
uprising ends.  ‘Major Artery’  “This one is a little bit more serious than  Egypt , but
it’s still not reaching the major artery in the economy’s
body,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s private wealth management unit. “The market still
believes that this is still not an issue that is out of control
yet. That doesn’t mean it can’t become one, but so far the
market’s reaction has been reflective of the fact that we’re
still not in a real critical point where this stuff is going to
blow up in our faces.”  Mideastern political protests add “stagflationary winds”
to the global economy, according to Mohamed El-Erian, chief
executive officer at Pacific Investment Management Co. in  Newport Beach , California. Higher prices and shrunken markets
add to the “new normal” that Western nations face, said El-
Erian in a Bloomberg Television interview with Tom Keene on the
“Surveillance Midday” program.  Top Performers  Higher commodity costs are unlikely to drag down stocks
anytime soon, according to  Jonathan Golub , chief U.S. equity
strategist at UBS AG. Commodity-related stocks are poised to be
top performers as they were in the previous bull market, which
lasted from October 2002 to October 2007, Golub wrote today.  The S&P 500 Energy Index, which fared the best among the
benchmark’s 10 main industry groups during the five-year surge,
is also setting the pace this year. The industry group’s gauge
gained 13 percent through the end of last week, while an index
of the S&P 500’s raw-material producers added 4.5 percent.  Wal-Mart dropped 3.1 percent to $53.67 today. The world’s
biggest retailer posted a seventh straight quarterly sales drop
at its U.S. stores, falling short of its own projections for the
holiday period. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year slid
1.8 percent in the quarter ended Jan. 28, Wal-Mart said.  Financial stocks had the second-biggest decline of 10
groups in the S&P 500, slumping 3.1 percent collectively. The
KBW Bank Index tumbled 3.5 percent as all 24 stocks fell.  Increased Defaults  Bank of America fell 3.9 percent to $14.18. The biggest
U.S. lender by assets raised the goodwill impairment to reflect
increased defaults and an almost two-year-old change in rules.
The bank restated federal regulatory filings to record the
writedown to its FIA Card Services unit in 2009’s first half,
the firm said yesterday in a statement.  A gauge of raw-materials stocks in the S&P 500 had the
biggest decline within 10 industries, dropping 3.2 percent.
Copper fell the most in three months on concern that the surging
cost of oil may slow economic growth, curbing demand for the
metal used in wires and plumbing. Lead, nickel, zinc, aluminum
and tin also declined.  Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly traded
copper producer, slumped 4.9 percent to $50.38.  Alcoa Inc ., the
largest U.S. aluminum producer, dropped 4.3 percent, the most in
the Dow average, to $16.54.  Exxon Mobil, the world’s largest energy company, rallied
1.1 percent to $85.44. Chevron rose 1.6 percent to $100.32.  Airlines Slide  The  NYSE Arca Airline  Index tumbled 5.2 percent as all of
its 15 stocks dropped amid concern that higher oil prices may
hurt airline earnings.  United Continental Holdings Inc . sank 9.2
percent to $24.44, while  AMR Corp . slumped 5.7 percent to $7.02.    Carnival Corp ., an operator of cruise ships, dropped 7.9
percent to $42.09.    Hewlett-Packard Co . plunged 9.7 percent to $43.55 in after-
market trading at 5:05 p.m. in New York, extending a decline in
regular trading. The world’s largest computer maker forecast
second-quarter profit and sales that missed analysts’
predictions as a slowdown in  consumer spending  throttled growth.
Excluding some costs, profit will be $1.19 to $1.21 a share this
quarter. That compares with profit of $1.26, the average
estimates of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Stocks briefly trimmed losses in the first hour of trading
after the Conference Board’s index of sentiment increased to
70.4, the highest since February 2008, from 64.8 the prior
month. Economists projected the gauge would be little changed at
65.5, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
