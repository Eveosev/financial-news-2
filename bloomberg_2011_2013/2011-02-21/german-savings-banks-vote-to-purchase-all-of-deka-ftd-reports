The savings banks in Rhineland-
Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg voted unanimously to buy the
rest of Dekabank Deutsche Girozentrale, the Financial Times
Deutschland reported.  The two associations were the first to decide on the German
savings banks’ purchase of the remaining 50 percent of Deka from
the country’s state-owned lenders, the  newspaper  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Most of the other regional associations will vote this
month, and if they also support the deal, it may be closed
before the end of March, the FTD said. The state-owned lenders
will get about 2.3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) for their stake,
the newspaper said. As part of the deal, the savings banks will
pay about 1.3 billion euros, while Dekabank will acquire its own
shares for about 1 billion euros, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
