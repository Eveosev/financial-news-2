Uranium prices, which gained in
every week of January, fell by 6 percent after the entry into
the market of a “non-traditional seller,” according to
 TradeTech LLC .  Uranium-oxide concentrate for immediate delivery traded at
$68.50 a pound in the seven days ended Feb. 18, down $4.25 from
the week before, Denver-based pricing service TradeTech said in
a Feb. 18 report. Ux Consulting Co. on Feb. 15 quoted the price
at $72.25 a pound. UxC will update its price later today.  Nuclear-power utilities buy the bulk of their uranium for
processing into fuel from mining companies, with the contracts
mostly extending beyond a year. The immediate delivery, or  spot
market , allows trading for delivery within a year and includes
financial investors. The U.S. government also periodically
conducts auctions to reduce stocks.  “The entry of a non-traditional seller into the market
looking to place over 800,000 pounds of uranium oxide triggered
the price slide,” TradeTech said, without giving details on the
seller. “A lack of clarity and speculation about the true
motivation for the sale provided momentum to the price
decline.”  There have been “numerous reports” of Chinese traders
seeking to sell uranium on the spot market, UxC said Feb. 15.  Uranium prices, which reached a record high of $136 a pound
in 2007 before falling to about $40, have risen since mid-2010
as China increased the use of nuclear power to curb emissions
from burning coal. More than 150 new reactors are planned
worldwide by 2030, with  China  planning 110 units, according to
data compiled by the  World Nuclear Association .  Seven transactions for 700,000 pounds of uranium were
completed last week, TradeTech said. A non-U.S. producer entered
the market seeking offers for 300,000 pounds of the material,
the pricing service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
