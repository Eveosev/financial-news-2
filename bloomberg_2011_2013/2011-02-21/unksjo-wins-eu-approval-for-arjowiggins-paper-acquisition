Munksjo AB won European Union
regulatory approval to buy the specialty paper operations of
Arjowiggins SAS for about 95 million euros, the European
Commission said in an e-mailed statement today.  Munksjo, a paper manufacturer, is owned by Chicago-based
Madison Dearborn Partners LLC. EU regulators said the deal
“would not significantly increase the risk of coordination
regarding prices or capacity” because the company would face
“effective competitors” in  Europe  including Germany-based
Technocell AG and Fabryka Papieru Malta Decor SA of  Poland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
