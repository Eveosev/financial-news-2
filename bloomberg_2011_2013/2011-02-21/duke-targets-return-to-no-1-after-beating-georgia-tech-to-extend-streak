  Duke University  is targeting a
return to the No. 1 spot in the college basketball polls after
beating Georgia Tech 79-57 to extend the nation’s longest home
winning streak to 34 games.  Nolan Smith scored 28 points yesterday at Cameron Indoor
Stadium in Durham,  North Carolina , as  Duke  won its sixth
straight game to improve its record to 25-2.  The Blue Devils, the defending national champions, spent
the first 10 weeks of the season ranked No. 1 and may top the
polls again when they’re released later today.  The four teams ahead of Duke in the Associated Press media
poll and ESPN/USA Today coaches’ poll -- Kansas, Ohio State,  Texas  and Pittsburgh -- all lost during the past week.  Kyle Singler added 15 points and nine rebounds for Duke,
which took control with a 54-22 scoring run that followed a
technical foul on coach Mike Krzyzewski.  To contact the reporter on this story:
