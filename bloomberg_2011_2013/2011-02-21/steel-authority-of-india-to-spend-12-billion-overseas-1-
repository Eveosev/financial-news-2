  Steel Authority of India Ltd ., the
nation’s second-largest producer, plans to spend as much as $12
billion building plants overseas as global demand recovers.  The state-run company is in talks to set up factories in
Indonesia, Mongolia, Oman and South Africa, Chairman C.S. Verma
said today at an industry conference in  New Delhi . The plants
will each have an initial capacity of 3 million metric tons, he
said, without giving a timeframe.  Steel Authority, which plans to add factories at home with
South Korea’s  Posco  and Japan’s Kobe Steel Ltd., is also seeking
facilities abroad as sales rebound from the deepest global
recession in seven decades. Global demand for steel may increase
11 percent this year, according to the World Steel Association.  The shares fell as much as 1.8 percent to 157.30 rupees and
traded at 157.65 rupees as of 1 p.m. in Mumbai.  To contact the reporters on this story:
