U.K. stocks fell, halting the  FTSE
100 Index ’s three-week gain, as investors speculated unrest in
Libya will cause energy prices to climb, curbing economic
growth.  Bank shares fell as demand for overnight loans from the
European Central Bank remained elevated for a third day.  Barclays Plc  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  slipped.  JJB
Sports Plc , an unprofitable sporting goods retailer, sank after
announcing the results of its share sale.  Invensys Plc  climbed
on reports it may be targeted for a takeover.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index retreated 68.19, or 1.1
percent, to 6,014.8 at the close in London. The  FTSE All-Share
Index  also dropped 1.1 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell
1.6 percent.  The FTSE 100 is still up 2 percent this year, extending its
rally since March 2009 to 71 percent, as investors bet that a
stronger economic recovery will boost corporate earnings.  Muammar Qaddafi’s son called on protesters in  Libya  to
engage in dialogue or face a civil war that risks the country’s
oil wealth, as a widening revolt posed the most serious
challenge to his father’s four decades of rule.  “The situation in the Middle East is omnipresent and
weighing on the market,” said Kishan Mandalia, a sales trader
at City Index Ltd. in London. “Financials are down after a

market closed for a public holiday.  Demand for overnight loans from the European Central Bank
was elevated for a third day, holding close to a 20-month high.  Bank Borrowing  Banks borrowed 14.2 billion euros ($19.4 billion) via the

more than in its main refinancing operations.  Barclays fell 2.2 percent to 322.25 pence. Royal Bank of  Scotland  slipped 3.9 percent to 46.64 pence.  Royal Bank of Scotland is preparing to sell $1.6 billion of

manufacturing company is being stalked by engineers considering
