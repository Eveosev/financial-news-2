Current New York Knicks players may
end up with the  New Jersey Nets  if New York agrees on a trade
for the Denver Nuggets’ Carmelo Anthony, ESPN reported.  With both the Knicks and Nets offering Denver multiplayer
packages to acquire Anthony, the Nets are considering a separate
deal with the Nuggets if they lose out on the bidding,  ESPN said 
on its website, citing unidentified high-ranking league
officials.  The Knicks’ offer to Denver may end up including forwards
Danilo Gallinari and  Wilson Chandler , guard  Raymond Felton  and
center Timofey Mozgov for a package that includes Anthony and
Chauncey Billups. The Nets would then consider using two first-
round draft picks to obtain Mozgov and either Gallinari, Felton
or Chandler from the Nuggets, ESPN said.  The Knicks are willing to trade Gallinari, Chandler, Felton
and a first-round pick to Denver, though the Nuggets are pushing
for Mozgov to be included in the package, ESPN said.  The Knicks and Nets competed in negotiations last year to
land free-agent All-Star LeBron James, who eventually chose the  Miami Heat . The Nets are moving to a new arena in Brooklyn from
Newark, New Jersey, for the 2012-13 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
