  Truworths International Ltd .,  South
Africa ’s largest publicly traded clothing retailer, gained in
Johannesburg trading after first-half profit rose and the
company said it will consider share buybacks and acquisitions.  Net income climbed to 1.03 billion rand ($144 million) in
the six months through Dec. 26, from 864 million rand a year
earlier, as sales advanced 15 percent to 4.6 billion rand,
Truworths said today. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to 1.79
billion rand, up from 1.07 billion rand a year earlier, the Cape
Town-based retailer said in a stock exchange filing.  “The group’s strong financial position will enable
management to consider share buybacks and potential investment
and acquisition opportunities,” Truworths said. While the
first-half results “reflect the cumulative benefits of low  interest rates , low inflation and higher real wage increases,
management is cautious to assume that a sustained recovery in
South African  consumer spending  is evident.”  Truworths rose as much as 3.7 percent to 67.92 rand and
traded 2.7 percent higher at 67.24 rand as of 2:31 p.m., giving
the company a market value of 30.7 billion rand.  The retailer raised its first-half dividend by 25 percent
to 1.28 rand a share.  Chief Executive Officer Michael Mark, who led the company
since 1991, has extended his contract until June 30, 2013, the
Truworths said. It named Mark Sardi, a chartered accountant and
former investment banker, as chief financial officer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
