French soft wheat rated “good” or
“excellent” was unchanged in the week ended June 18, after
climbing in the nine previous weeks as rains aided plants, crop
office FranceAgriMer said.  Seventy-three percent of the soft  wheat  crop received the
top ratings, the Montreuil-sous-Bois, France-based office wrote
on its website today. That compares with 27 percent rated
“good” or “excellent” in the year-ago period when a spring
drought stunted growth.  France  is the European Union’s largest wheat grower.
Rainfall in the country’s main wheat growing regions since March
has been in line with long-term average values, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture satellite data. The ratings
released today are the average for eight regions representing 54
percent of France’s soft-wheat area, FranceAgriMer wrote.  Durum  wheat rated “good” or “excellent” was unchanged
at 57 percent, based on three regions that make up 58 percent of
French production, the data show.  Corn  with top ratings rose to
73 percent as of June 18, from 69 percent a week earlier.  Winter  barley  with “good” or “excellent” ratings fell
to 65 percent from 66 percent a week earlier. Spring barley
rated in the top two categories was unchanged at 84 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
