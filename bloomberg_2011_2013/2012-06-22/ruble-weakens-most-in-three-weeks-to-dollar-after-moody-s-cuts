The ruble sank for the first week in
three as Urals crude,  Russia ’s main export, dropped to a 1 1/2-
year low and Moody’s downgraded 15 global banks’ credit ratings.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.9 percent to 33.27 per
dollar by the close in Moscow, giving it a 2.3 percent drop in
the week. Russia’s 132 billion rubles ($3.9 billion) of bonds
due April 2021 slid, raising the yield six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 8.64 percent.  Urals crude sank 1.3 percent to $86.52 per barrel, the
lowest price since November 2010. Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev 
ordered the government to prepare a budget plan based on a $60
oil price, Vedomosti reported yesterday, citing two officials
familiar with the plan.  “The only reason is fear,” Aleksey Kulakov, a Moscow-
based currency trader at OAO Promsvyazbank, said by e-mail.
“When people hear that the government’s preparing for oil at
$60 per barrel, they can only run to buy dollars.”  The MSCI  Emerging Markets   Index (MXEF)  of stocks retreated 1.7
percent after Moody’s downgraded Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse
Group AG and 13 other banks yesterday. European  stock futures 
fell as German business confidence declined to its lowest in
more than two years.  The ruble depreciated 0.3 percent to 41.7225 per euro and
0.6 percent to 37.0736 against the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket. Investors increased bets on the currency weakening,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.7801 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 33.6105
per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
