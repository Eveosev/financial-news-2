Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , the world’s
second-biggest maker of personal-computers, said it didn’t issue
new guidance to its partners about growth, after  Taiwan ’s China
Times newspaper reported the company offered updated estimates
to its suppliers.  “We continue to be confident that we will outgrow the
market worldwide,” Lenovo said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. No new guidance was provided to “suppliers or
manufacturing partners,” it said.  Lenovo told suppliers its annual shipments growth this year
will be between 13 percent and 15 percent, compared with an
earlier guidance of as much as 25 percent, China Times reported
yesterday, without saying where it got the information. The
Chinese computer maker’s shares fell the most in more than two
years in  Hong Kong  trading yesterday.  Lenovo kept its guidance for sales growth of between 5
percent and 10 percent in the quarter ending June 30, compared
with the previous three months, Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst Eve Jung wrote in a report yesterday, citing management at the
computer maker. Growth in the September quarter “remains on
track,” according to Jung.  The Chinese  company  fell 1.3 percent to HK$6.68 today,
compared with a 1.4 percent decline in Hong Kong’s benchmark
Hang Seng Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
