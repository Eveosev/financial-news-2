Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  will create 300 to
400 jobs in the short term in France with a third logistics base
in Chalon-sur-Saone,  Les Echos  said, without saying where it got
the information.  Amazon chose Chalon-sur-Saone site over Beaune, both in the
region of Burgundy, Les Echos said. Amazon will first rent about
50,000 square meters of space and later build its own center of
about 100,000 square meters. That will involve an investment of
40 million euros ($50 million), which could create 1,000 jobs,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
