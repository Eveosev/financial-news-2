Construction starts on  London 
residential developments fell by more than half as the U.K.
economy fell into its second recession since 2009 and demand
waned, consulting firm Drivers Jonas Deloitte said today.  Thirty-five new projects were started in the U.K. capital
in the six months through March, the London-based firm’s
biannual Residential Crane Survey showed. That compares with 81
developments commenced a year earlier.  “While it is too early to call this slowdown in new
activity a clear trend, it does reflect the unease in the wider
London residential market,” Anthony Duggan, head of research,
at Drivers Jonas Deloitte, said in a statement.  U.K. homebuilders such as  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG)  and
 Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV)  have focused on London and southeast
 England , where  house prices  have been the most resilient. The
U.K. entered a recession in the first quarter as construction
output fell 4.8 percent, the most in three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
