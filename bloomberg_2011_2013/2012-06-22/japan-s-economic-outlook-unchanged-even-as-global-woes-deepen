Japan ’s government maintained its
assessment of the domestic economy while cutting the view of the
global economy for the first time in nine months as the debt
crisis in Europe deepens and the U.S. recovery shows signs of
slowing.  “The Japanese economy is on the way to recovery at a
moderate pace partly due to reconstruction demand, although
difficulties continue to prevail,” the Cabinet Office said in
the monthly report for June released in Tokyo today. “On the
whole, there is an increased sense of a slowdown in the global
economy.”  The economy will grow 2.2 percent in the year starting
April 1, according to the Cabinet’s estimate in December.
Domestic demand has been partly supported by the almost 20
trillion yen ($249 billion) in reconstruction spending budgeted
by the government since last year’s disaster.  Industrial production and business investment are “picking
up slowly,” while corporate profits are improving and exports
are “showing signs of picking up,” the government said. “The
employment situation is picking up, although it still remains
severe partly due to the earthquake disaster.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
