Cyprus, which may need as much as 6
billion euros ($7.6 billion) to prop up its banks, may request a
European bailout by June 26, Phileleftheros reported.  The government will submit the request irrespective of the
results of loan talks with  Russia , the Nicosia-based newspaper
said today, citing an unidentified government official.  Fitch Ratings will cut Cyprusâ€™s sovereign credit rating
today to non-investment grade, the newspaper said.  Fitch spokesman  Peter Fitzpatrick  declined to comment on
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
