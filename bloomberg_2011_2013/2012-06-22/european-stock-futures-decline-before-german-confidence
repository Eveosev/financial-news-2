day as German business confidence declined to its lowest level
in more than two years.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  slid 2.1 percent,  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)

the close of trade. The gauge has declined 9.5 percent from its
high on March 16 on concern that  Greece  will have to leave the

Reserve  cut its U.S. growth forecast and a survey indicated

future with extremely low growth, with low  interest rates  and a
lot of politically driven volatility,” Lucy MacDonald, the

manages about $128 billion, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview.  The Stoxx 600 has still climbed 1 percent this week as

the economic outlook.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said today its business

for a second straight month to 105.3 from 106.9 in May. That’s

Bloomberg News survey.  Spain’s banks would need as much as 62 billion euros ($78
billion) in capital to withstand a worst-case economic scenario,
according to two consulting firms hired by the government to

crisis talks with Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti , Spanish

euros.  Michael Page (MPI)  tumbled 4.3 percent to 365.8 pence. The U.K.
recruitment-services company was cut to underperform, which

their volatility.  America Movil SAB, billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s wireless
carrier, yesterday disclosed a 21 percent stake in KPN, up from

greater value than Slim’s offer of 8 euros a share.  Miners Retreat  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  the world’s biggest mining company , fell
