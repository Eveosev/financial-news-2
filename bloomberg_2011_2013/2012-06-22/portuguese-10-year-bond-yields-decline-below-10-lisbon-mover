Portugal ’s 10-year bonds advanced
for a seventh day, with the yield falling below 10 percent for
the first time in more than a year.  The  10-year rate  declined 66 basis points to 9.49 percent
as of 5:04 p.m. London time, the lowest since May 2011. Two-year
Portuguese note yields fell 92 basis points to 6.94 percent, the
lowest since March 2011.  “The successful completion of Portugal’s fourth adjustment
program review was followed by very favorable developments in
the bond market,” Portuguese Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said
late yesterday in Luxembourg after a meeting of euro-area
finance ministers. “Since June 4 we have seen a very
significant narrowing of the bond yields.”  Portugal’s financial aid plan remains “on track,” the
European Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund  said in a June 4 joint statement
about the review of the Portuguese program.  To contact the reporters on this story:
