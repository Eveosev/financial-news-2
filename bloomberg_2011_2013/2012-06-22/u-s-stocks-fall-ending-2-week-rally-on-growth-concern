U.S. stocks fell, ending a two-week
winning streak by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after the
 Federal Reserve  cut its economic forecast and a  bear market  in
commodities prices dragged down energy producers.  Equities rose in the week’s final session as  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  paced a rally in banks following a downgrade by Moody’s
Investors Service that was no worse than the credit-rating firm
had warned. Energy producers lost the most in the S&P 500 for
the week, sinking 3.3 percent as economic reports added to signs
of a global slowdown.  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  slid 4.9 percent and
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. tumbled 16 percent after disappointing
profit forecasts. Facebook Inc. jumped 10 percent.  The S&P 500 slid 0.6 percent to 1,335.02, snapping a  two-
week rally  of 5.1 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
declined 126.39 points, or 1 percent, to 12,640.78, trimming its
advance for the year to 3.5 percent.  “We are in a low-growth environment,” David Pearl, who
oversees $21 billion in assets as co-chief investment officer at
New York-based Epoch Investment Partners, said in a phone
interview. “If the economy around the world is slow, corporate
profitability is going to be slow, so the return will be mild.”  Equities rose on the first two days of the week amid
optimism that Greece’s attempts to form a government will help
the nation stay in the euro and that the Fed would announce more
measures to spur the economy. Global stocks tumbled on June 21,
with the  S&P 500  plunging 2.2 percent for its second-biggest
drop of the year, after the central bank cut its growth estimate
while data showed euro-area manufacturing shrank at the fastest
pace in three years and a Chinese output gauge indicated
contraction.  Operation Twist  U.S. stocks retreated even as the Fed said it will extend
its stimulus program known as Operation Twist, disappointing
investors anticipating a more aggressive approach.  “The Fed is doing whatever it can and be extraordinarily
accommodative,” Dean Junkans, chief investment officer for the
wealth management, brokerage and retirement units of San
Francisco-based  Wells Fargo & Co ., which oversees $1.3 trillion
in client assets, said in a June 20 phone interview. “It’s
important for them to do something to show support for the
market, but I don’t think it will have a material impact on the
economy.”  Expectations for further policy action gave stocks their
first back-to-back weekly gain since April on June 15. The S&P
500 earlier this month was on the brink of a so-called
correction, or a 10 percent drop from a recent peak, on concern
about a global slowdown and a worsening of  Europe ’s crisis.  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S., which
drops when reports miss projections in Bloomberg surveys, hit
minus 64.8 during the week, the lowest level since August.  Energy Tumbles  The S&P 500 energy index slumped 3.3 percent as concern
about slowing global growth sent the S&P GSCI commodities gauge
to the lowest level since 2010 on June 21, extending its decline
from a February high to 22 percent.  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG)  erased
9.3 percent to $87.62.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  slipped 3.7 percent to
$100.44 as  oil prices  touched an eight-month low.  Financial shares rallied on the last day to pare their
weekly loss to 0.1 percent as group. The prospect of downgrades
had weighed on the industry since Moody’s said in February it
was reviewing 17 banks with capital-markets operations because
of fragile confidence and tighter regulations that pinched
revenue. The S&P’s  financials  gauge sank 17 percent from its
2012 peak on March 26 through June 4.  JPMorgan Chase advanced 2.7 percent during the week as none
of the financial firms was cut more than Moody’s had forecast.
 Morgan Stanley (MS) , the world’s largest brokerage, gained 1.3
percent to $14.14 on June 22, paring its loss for the week to
1.1 percent.  Second Cut  P&G declined 4.9 percent to $59.83, the biggest loss since
August 2009. The world’s largest consumer-goods company cut its
earnings and revenue forecasts for the second time in less than
two months, hurt by slowing sales growth in Europe and the U.S.  Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)  dropped 16 percent, the most since
January 2000, to $61.20, after forecasting fiscal second-quarter
profit that was less than analysts’ estimated amid slowing same-
store sales.  Ryder System Inc. (R)  slumped 16 percent to $35.44 for the
biggest retreat in the S&P 500. The truck leasing company cut
its full-year earnings forecast because of lower demand for
commercial rentals.  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  gained 3.3 percent to $90.54. The operator of
the world’s largest cargo airline climbed after pledging
“significant cost reductions.” Executives said revenue and
 earnings  growth will be impacted by “weaker economic
conditions” such as the  European debt crisis , and slowing
growth in  Asia .  New Buy  Facebook climbed 10 percent to $33.05 as Nomura Holdings
Inc. rated the social-network operator a buy in new coverage.
“ Facebook (FB) ’s industry-leading reach, engaged user base, and
comprehensive user dataset will enable the company to continue
to grow and take share in the display market,” Brian Nowak, a
New York-based analyst with Nomura, wrote in a note.  The company has climbed 28 percent since its low on June 5,
as it unveiled new products and services, and capped its first
weekly gain on June 15. Concern Facebook was overvalued and that
the company will struggle to increase revenue fast enough pushed
the stock down as much as 32 percent from its IPO price of $38
on May 17.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  added 2.3 percent to $30.70. The world’s
largest software maker unveiled its own Windows-powered tablet
computer called Surface in a renewed attempt to take on Apple
Inc.’s iPad.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  surged 14 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $15.88. The biggest maker of thin-film solar panels
received permission to continue construction on a $1.36 billion
power project in Los Angeles County.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
