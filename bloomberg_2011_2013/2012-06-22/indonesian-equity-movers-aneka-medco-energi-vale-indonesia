company.  PT Dian Swastatika Sentosa (DSSA)  , a power producer,
rose 7.7 percent to 14,000 rupiah, the most since May 22, after

reached when called at his office.  PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS)  ,  Indonesia ’s largest gas

Java province.  PT Vale Indonesia (INCO)  , the nation’s biggest nickel
producer, fell 4.8 percent to 2,500 rupiah, the sharpest drop
since June 1. The stock fell after commodity prices declined,
