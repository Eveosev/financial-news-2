Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil company, will raise gasoline and diesel
prices next week, the company said today in a regulatory filing.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
will increase prices of gasoline by 7.8 percent and diesel by
3.9 percent from June 25, the company said. Brazil plans to
remove the so-called Cide tax on fuel to prevent a price
increase for consumers.  Petrobras, which sells imported gasoline at a loss because
of price controls aimed at keeping inflation in check, jumped
5.4 percent in  Sao Paulo  trading this week amid speculation that
authorities would agree to increases. The changes announced
today aim to align prices with international values on a median-
to long-term basis, the company said.  Energy Minister Edison Lobao, who said last week that
Brazil wouldn’t increase gasoline prices this year, told
reporters in Rio on June 19 that the government is constantly
reviewing them.  The government cut to zero the Cide tax on gasoline and
diesel to “neutralize” the impact of price increases at
Petrobras refineries, the  Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Petrobras shares rose 1.45 percent at the close in Sao
Paulo today to 19.55 reais.  To contact the reporters on this story:
