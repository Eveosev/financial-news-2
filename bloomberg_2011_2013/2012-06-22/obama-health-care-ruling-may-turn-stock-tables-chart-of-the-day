Health-care providers are unlikely
to sustain a stock-market lead over medical plans once the U.S.
Supreme Court decides on the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, according to Jefferies & Co. analysts.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the performance of Morgan
Stanley indexes for the industry groups since the last week of
March, when the court heard arguments against President  Barack
Obama ’s health-care overhaul. A ruling is due by next week on
the law’s constitutionality.  Morgan Stanley’s Health Care Provider Index rose as much as
11 percent after setting this year’s low on June 4. The gain put
the indicator ahead of the firm’s Health Care Payer Index for
the year after trailing by 21 percentage points in April.  “Providers face a very tough road ahead,” the Jefferies
analysts wrote in a report yesterday. They cited pressure from
commercial health plans to limit costs, election “noise” from
presidential and congressional candidates, and risks tied to
Medicare rates and government finances.  Health-maintenance organizations and other payers have a
more favorable outlook, the report said, because they stand to
benefit from relatively low demand for medical care along with
efforts to reduce expenses.  David Windley , a managing director based in Nashville,
Tennessee, and three other analysts contributed to the report.
Windley was joined by  Arthur Henderson  and Brian Tanquilut, also
based in Nashville, and Omotayo Okusanya, based in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
