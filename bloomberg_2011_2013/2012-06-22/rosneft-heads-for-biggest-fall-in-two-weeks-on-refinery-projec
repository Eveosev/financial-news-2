OAO Rosneft fell the most in more
than two weeks as plans to build a refinery spurred concern
profit at  Russia ’s largest oil producer may suffer from capital
expense.  The stock declined 1.5 percent to 204.39 rubles by the
close in Moscow, the most since June 5.  Rosneft yesterday agreed to borrow as much as 100 billion
rubles ($3 billion) for five years from VTB Group for the
refinery near Moscow and is looking to develop projects with Eni
SpA and Statoil ASA. The refinery’s cost projection is more than
$7 billion and its capacity will be as much as 12 million metric
tons a year, Sergei Shoigu, the regional governor, said at the
St. Petersburg International Economic Forum yesterday.  “We see the news as negative for Rosneft,” UralSib
Capital analysts led by Alexei Kokin said in an e-mailed note.
“The company’s investment decisions are based on government
priorities rather than on maximization of  shareholder value ,
which thus create significant overinvestment risks.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
