Clariant AG (CLN)  said it will meet in two
to three weeks with potential suitors for divisions that the
specialty-chemical maker is selling, and it’s confident the
disposals will be completed in the next 18 months.  “Strategic buyers who can reliably execute on a
transaction” will be the favored bidders for the businesses,
which generate as much as 1.5 billion Swiss francs ($1.57
billion) in revenue, Chief Executive Officer Hariolf Kottmann
said at a presentation at the Swiss manufacturer’s capital
markets day conference in Munich. Clariant will give priority to
speed of execution in any sale, and proceeds will be used to
reduce debt, Chief Financial Officer Patrick Jany said.  Clariant is exiting production of ingredients for the
paper, textile, emulsion and detergent industries, whose margins
have declined because of competition and rising energy costs.
The Muttenz-based chemical maker plans to focus on more
profitable operations acquired in the  takeover  of catalyst maker
Sued-Chemie for $2.7 billion in 2011.  The 18-month deadline for the disposals that Clariant
outlined today in a  statement  is “on the safe side,” Kottmann
said. Transactions aren’t dependent on debt covenants, CFO Jany
said.  Clariant  fell  4.3 percent to 9.85 francs at the close in
Zurich, the biggest decline since May 14. That pared the stock’s
gain this year to 9.6 percent, valuing the company at 2.91
billion francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
