Gasoline rose as the dollar slipped
after the  European Central Bank  took additional measures to
improve bank’s access to funds.  Futures gained for the first time in five days after the
ECB said it decided this week to relax rules on the collateral
that banks can offer in exchange for central bank funds. The
dollar weakened 0.2 percent against the euro after the
announcement, reversing an earlier gain, raising the appeal of
commodities as an investment.  “This is a market that’s been begging for stimulus the
last couple days,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at
the Price Futures Group in Chicago. “It stopped the freefall,”
he said.  Gasoline for July delivery increased 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.5651 a gallon at 9:46 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  The U.S. Federal Reserve on June 20 extended its program to
replace short-term bonds with longer-term debt without launching
a third round of quantitative easing.  “Maybe the reason Bernanke is keeping his bullets in his
holster is because he thinks it’s Europe’s turn,” Flynn said.  Heating oil for July delivery rose 0.27 cent to $2.528 a
gallon on the Nymex.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.5
cent to $3.454 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest price since Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
