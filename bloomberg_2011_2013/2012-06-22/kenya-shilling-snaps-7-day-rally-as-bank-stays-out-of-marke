Kenya ’s shilling snapped a seven-day
rally as the central bank refrained from entering the market for
a third day.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy depreciated
0.4 percent to close at 83.86 per dollar after trading 0.9
percent weaker at 84.33 earlier in the capital Nairobi.  The bank didn’t offer repurchase agreements and term-
auction deposits for a third day today, an official who asked
not to be identified in line with policy said. The bank
reintroduced term-auction deposits as a “liquidity management”
measure on June 5.  The shilling gained 2.2 percent in the seven days through
yesterday, closing at 83.55 per dollar, the highest since May
11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Uganda ’s shilling weakened 0.1 percent to close at 2,470
per dollar, while Tanzania’s currency depreciated by less than
0.1 percent to close at 1,582 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
