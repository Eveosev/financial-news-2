KKR & Co. (KKR) , the buyout firm run by
 Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , has gathered more than $3
billion for its second Asia fund, according to a filing.  The New York-based firm raised $2.76 billion from outside
investors, and its general partners have committed $250 million,
KKR said in today’s  filing  with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The private-equity firm is offering investors the
option of a lower management fee or a greater share of
transaction fees levied on the companies it owns, according to
marketing documents obtained by Bloomberg News in December.  KKR is targeting $6 billion for KKR Asia Fund II to make
deals in the region, where private-equity investments jumped 38
percent from 2009 to 2011, according to estimates from the Asian
Venture Capital Journal.  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  and TPG Capital are
also amassing regional funds to take advantage of Asian
economies growing faster than those in the U.S. and Europe.  KKR raised $4 billion for its first Asia fund in 2007. That
fund was producing an 11 percent net internal rate of return as
of Dec. 31, according to the Washington State Investment Board,
