Jose Manuel Lara was disqualified
from golf’s BMW International Open after his caddie tried to
hide the presence of an extra club in the Spaniard’s bag.  Lara’s caddie noticed a 15th club in the bag on the second
hole of yesterday’s opening round in Cologne,  Germany , and went
into some bushes to try to hide it, according to European Tour
referee John Paramor. That raised the suspicions of playing
partners Damien McGrane and Peter Hedblom.  “They went and asked the chap, ‘What are you doing?”’
Paramor said in an interview with  Sky Sports . “And he sort of
fumbled out an answer saying, ‘I’ve got this wrong, I’ve done
something bad, I wished it hadn’t happened.”’  After the caddie acknowledged his actions, which Paramor
deemed “serious,” Lara was given a two-stroke penalty on each
of the first two holes. After finishing with a 1-over-par 73,
the two-time European Tour winner was disqualified.  “It was clearly the caddie doing what he felt at the time
was the right thing, but was clearly the wrong thing,” Paramor
told Sky Sports. “He’s kind of been asked not to come back and
that’s how the matter’s been resolved.”  Lara, 44, is No. 200 in the Official World Golf Ranking.
His best finishes this season were fourth at the Avantha Masters
in February and fifth at the Sicilian Open in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
