Sony Corp. (6758)  and  Panasonic Corp. (6752) ,
 Japan ’s biggest makers of TVs, may announce an agreement next
week to cooperate in making sets that use new organic light-
emitting diode displays, company officials said.  The companies may issue a statement before their
 shareholder meetings  June 27, the officials said, asking not to
be identified because the plan is private.  The partnership would be the first between the main TV
operations at the two companies, which are losing money as the
strengthened yen erodes overseas earnings and as competition
from South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and  LG Electronics
Inc. (066570)  intensifies. The two Korean companies have said they will
introduce OLED models by the end of the year.  The Nikkei newspaper reported the Sony-Panasonic agreement
earlier today, without saying where it got the information.
Spokesmen at both companies declined to comment.  Sony  rose  as much as 4.3 percent to 1,148 yen and traded at
1,144 yen as of 11:10 a.m. in  Tokyo . Panasonic climbed 1.3
percent.  OLED televisions are as thin as 4 millimeters (0.16 inches)
and produce sharper images than current liquid-crystal-display
models. Shipments of OLED TVs may grow to 2.1 million sets in
2015 from 34,000 in 2012, according to Englewood, Colorado-based
 IHS Inc. (IHS) ’s iSuppli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
