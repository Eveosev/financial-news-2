Iceland advanced in its bid to join
the European Union by opening discussions in three more policy
areas, the EU said.  Iceland began talks in the areas of transport policy,
social policy and employment, and financial control at a meeting
today in Brussels, the EU said in a statement. Today’s
discussions “marked a significant step forward” in Iceland’s
accession process, it said.  The meeting also confirmed the provisional completion of
negotiations in two areas: foreign, security and defense policy
and on consumer-protection and health policies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
