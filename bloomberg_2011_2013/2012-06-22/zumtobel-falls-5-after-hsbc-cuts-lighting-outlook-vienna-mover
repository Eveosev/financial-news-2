Zumtobel AG (ZAG) , the Austrian maker of
industrial lighting, fell the most in almost three months after
HSBC Global Research cut its earnings estimate for the company
in fiscal-year 2013 by 30 percent.  Zumtobel fell 40 cents, or 4.6 percent, to 8.25 euros a
share at the 5:30 p.m. close in the Austrian capital. That was
the lightmaker’s biggest daily drop since March 29. Zumtobel,
with a market value of 359 million euros ($450 million) on the
Vienna stock exchange, hasn’t closed that low since August 2009.  “We expect a rather sluggish top-line performance” when
Zumtobel reports full-year results June 27, said HSBC analyst
Christian Rath, who is neutral on Zumtobel shares, today in a
research note. HSBC lowered Zumtobel’s 2013 earnings before
interest and tax forecast to 41 million euros on “slowing
growth momentum in lighting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
