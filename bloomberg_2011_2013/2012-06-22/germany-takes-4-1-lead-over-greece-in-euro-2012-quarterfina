Germany  got three second-half goals
to take a 4-1 lead over Greece in their quarterfinal of soccer’s
European Championship.  Marco Reus smashed a shot in off the crossbar in the 74th
minute to extend the German control. He scored six minutes after
 Miroslav Klose  headed in, which followed a Sami Khedira goal in
the 61st minute to allow the Germans to retake the lead.  The Greeks had tied the match 1-1 when Giorgos Samaras
knocked in a cross from Dimitris Salpingidis in the 55th minute.
Captain Philipp Lahm had given Germany a first half advantage by
cutting in from the wing to hit a shot past outstretched Greek
goalkeeper Michalis Sifakis in the match in Gdansk,  Poland .  Germany had 70 percent of possession in the first half, and
had several chances to score before Lahm’s goal. The Greeks
tried to frustrate their opponents by keeping 9 or 10 players in
their half to defend.  Germany made it to tonight’s quarterfinal as the sole team
to win all three matches in the tournament’s opening group
round.  Greece  advanced by beating Russia 1-0 on the final day of
the opening stage.  The teams have met eight times, with the 2004 European
champion Greece never beating Germany, which has won 5 of the
matches and tied the others, according to statistics from FIFA,
the sport’s governing body.  Last night,  Portugal  defeated the Czech Republic 1-0 to
become the first team to reach the semifinals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
