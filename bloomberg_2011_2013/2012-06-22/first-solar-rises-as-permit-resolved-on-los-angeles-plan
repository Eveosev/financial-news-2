First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest maker
of thin-film solar panels, climbed the most since June 12 after
receiving permission to continue construction on a $1.36 billion
power project in Los Angeles County.  First Solar had the biggest increase among the Standard &
Poorâ€™s 500 Index companies,  rising  9.2 percent to $15.88 at the
close in  New York . Shares of the Tempe, Arizona-based company
have dropped 53 percent this year.  Construction of the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One plant
had been suspended during a permitting dispute with county
officials over building codes, First Solar said today in a
statement. The project is partially funded by a $646 million
U.S. Energy Department loan guarantee and is expected to be
complete next year.  First Solar sold the 230-megawatt Antelope Valley plant to
 Exelon Corp. (EXC)  in September. The price was $75 million, according
to a February filing from the solar company. The Chicago-based
power company said it would invest as much as $713 million into
the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
