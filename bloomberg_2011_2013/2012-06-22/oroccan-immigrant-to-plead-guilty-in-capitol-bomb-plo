A Moroccan immigrant accused of
attempting a suicide bombing at the U.S. Capitol is scheduled to
plead guilty today at a hearing in federal court in Virginia,
federal prosecutors said.  Amine El Khalifi, of Alexandria, Virginia, who was caught
by an FBI sting operation, was arrested in a parking garage near
the Capitol on Feb. 17 after meeting with an undercover agent
posing as a member of an armed extremist group.  He was taken into custody as he began walking toward the
Capitol carrying a MAC-10 automatic weapon and wearing a vest
containing what he believed to be a functioning bomb, according
to an affidavit filed in the case by Steven Hersem, an agent of
the  Federal Bureau of Investigation . The weapons, both of which
were provided by the government, had been made inoperable by
investigators, prosecutors said.  A Moroccan national, El Khalifi entered the U.S. in June
1999 on a tourist visa that expired later that year. He has
lived in the U.S. illegally since then, according to the
affidavit.  He was charged with attempted use a weapon of mass
destruction, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison
if convicted.  The plea hearing is scheduled to take place today before
U.S. District Judge James Cacheris in Alexandria, according a
statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Terms of the plea
agreement weren’t disclosed.   The case is U.S. v. El Khalifi, 12-mj-00087, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of  Virginia  (Alexandria).  To contact the reporter on this story:
