NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , the largest
wind- and solar-power operator in the U.S., plans to buy the
1,000-megawatt Blythe project in Riverside County, California,
which would be the world’s largest solar farm when complete.  NextEra, based in  Juno Beach ,  Florida , was the top bidder
for the unbuilt project in an auction for the assets of bankrupt
Solar Trust of America LLC, according to an attorney
representing creditors.  NextEra made “the highest and best bid after a spirited
auction with good results for the debtors,” Donald Detweiler,
an attorney with Pepper Hamilton LLP and counsel to the
committee of unsecured creditors, said in a voice-mail message
yesterday. He didn’t provide a price.  The winner of the auction couldn’t immediately be confirmed
in court papers. The auction was held yesterday in Wilmington,
Delaware, and a hearing to confirm the sale is scheduled for
June 27.  NextEra’s bid is for rights to complete development of
Blythe, including transmission access and land-use permits. A
contract Solar Trust previously obtained with Edison
International’s Southern California Edison would need to be
renegotiated with a buyer of the project, Marc Ulrich, the
utility’s vice president of alternative and renewable power,
said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
