French carmaker  Renault SA (RNO)  will halt
production at its Dacia plant in  Romania  for two more days this
month after another two-day stop on June 18 and June 19,  Ziarul
Financiar  reported today, citing unidentified company officials.  Renault won’t manufacture cars on June 25 and June 26 after
a strike at one of its French suppliers caused “supplying
difficulties,” according to the Bucharest-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
