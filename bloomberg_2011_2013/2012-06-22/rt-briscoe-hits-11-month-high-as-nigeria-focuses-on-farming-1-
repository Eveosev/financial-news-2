RT Briscoe Plc, a Nigerian company
that sells cars, tractors and other industrial machinery, rose
to the highest in 11 months, benefiting from a national focus on
agriculture, according to Lambeth Trust and Investment Co.  The stock advanced as much as 4 percent to 1.72 naira and
closed 1.8 percent up in Lagos at 1.68 naira, the highest since
July 25. RT Briscoe shares have risen 65 percent this year,
compared with a 3.2 percent increase in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange  All-Share Index over the same period.  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s most populous nation with more than 167
million people, plans to raise its agricultural output to meet
local demand and exports, President  Goodluck Jonathan  said on
May 29. This plan will lead to demand in agricultural equipment,
including tractors, according to David Adonri, chief executive
officer of Lagos-based Lambeth Trust.  “With the current emphasis placed on agriculture now, it
means that all operators in the agricultural value chain will
enjoy a boom in their business,” he said by phone today.
“Investors believe the price could rise to 2 naira within one
year. It is a small-cap company with rising profitability.”  Full-year profit for 2011 rose to 215.9 million naira ($1.3
million) from 152 billion naira a year earlier, the company said
in a statement published on the website of the Nigerian Stock
Exchange on April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
