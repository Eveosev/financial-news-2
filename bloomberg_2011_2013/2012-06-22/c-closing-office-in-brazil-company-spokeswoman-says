HTC Corp., Asia’s second-largest
smartphone maker, is closing its office in Brazil, the company
said in an e-mailed statement.  The move shouldn’t change service for current customers,
said Sally Julien, a spokeswoman for the Taiwan-based company,
in an e-mailed statement. Operations outside of Brazil won’t be
affected by the decision, she said.  The plans were previously reported by  Valor Economico .  To contact the reporter on this story:
