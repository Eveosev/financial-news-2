Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  plans to
expand its 401(k) business in the U.S. to benefit from a growing
number of Americans planning for their retirement, Chief
Executive Officer Donald Guloien said.  Manulife, Canada’s largest insurer, has been focusing on
“small-case” 401(k) plans, offered to employers with 500 or
fewer workers, Guloien said today in an interview in Toronto.  “We want to move up now into the middle market and get the
same kind of share in the middle market that we have in the
small-case market,” Guloien said. “We’re gearing up to do
exactly that.”  While Manulife has pegged much of its expansion strategy on
a growing middle class in  Asia , the owner of Boston-based John
Hancock Financial also seeks to increase its U.S. wealth-
management business. The U.S.  accounted  for half the company’s
C$8.7 billion ($8.5 billion) in wealth  sales  during the first
quarter.  “The market is going to be growing,” said Guloien, 55.
“More and more people are concerned about their retirement.
Americans are saving more.”  Manulife will boost its 401(k) business in part by
expanding the distribution platform, Guloien said. The Toronto-
based company has spent “millions of dollars to prepare
ourselves for the market,” he said.  Manulife shares rose 0.2 percent to close at C$10.86 in
Toronto. The firm’s shares are little changed this year,
compared with a 3 percent increase in the  S&P/TSX Life & Health
Insurance Index. (STLIFE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
