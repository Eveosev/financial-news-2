U.S. coal companies are boosting
exports through the  Gulf of Mexico  after meeting resistance to
West Coast port expansions, according to John Schlosser, chief
commercial officer at Kinder Morgan Terminals.  Opposition from environmental groups in the Pacific
Northwest has led to “delay after delay after delay after
delay” in establishing ports in that region to serve demand in
 Asia , Schlosser said today at the IHS McCloskey Coal USA
Conference in New York.  “The coal industry really needs this capacity,” he said.  The Houston-based company is expanding terminals in the
Gulf and the Southeast, including its Shipyard River operation
in Charleston,  South Carolina . Kinder plans to spend about $200
million to boost capacity there to 8 million tons a year from
2.5 million, and the project would be completed by 2015,
Schlosser said.  Kinder also plans to spend $250 million to build a 15
million-ton-a-year operation at Port Westward in  Oregon . He said
that project was to begin in 2015, and now it may be 2016 or
beyond, “given the opposition that continues to be thrown at
it.”  Exports  in 2011 rose to 107 million tons, the highest level
since 1991, according to Energy Department  data , 50 percent of
which went to  Europe  and 26 percent to Asia.  About 35 percent of exports were of the thermal variety,
used to generate electricity, with the remainder being more
profitable metallurgical coal, Energy Department data show. That
form is needed by steelmakers.  The Energy Department  forecast  June 12 that exports may
drop to 106 million tons this year and 97 million in 2013.
Exports averaged 56 million tons in the decade preceding 2011,
according to the agency.  Coal on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell 13 cents to
$54.05 a ton yesterday. Prices touched $54 on June 11, the
lowest since March 15, 2010, and have dropped 22 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
