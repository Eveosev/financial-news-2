The  International Finance
Corporation , the  World Bank ’s private-sector lending arm, will
lend 70 million euros ($87.7 million) to the Serbian unit of
 Societe Generale SA (GLE)  to finance agricultural development.  The loan is part of the IFC’s effort to “strengthen the
regional banking sector and support economic recovery,” the
lender and the bank said in a joint statement.  The IFC has identified agriculture as one of the areas in
with strong growth potential. Agriculture generates around 20
percent of the Serbian economy. Around 45 percent of Serbia’s
7.2 million citizens live in rural areas and one-third relies on
agriculture for income.  In 2011, the industry generated $2.8 billion in export
revenue, a 20 percent increase from the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
