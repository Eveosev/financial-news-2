Telenor ASA (TEL) ’s Serbian unit became
the country’s top mobile services provider by revenue last year,
the first time since entering the market six years ago, as
number portability intensified competition.  Telenor d.o.o.  took 43.6 percent of almost 847 million
euros ($1.06 billion) of total mobile revenue in 2011,
dethroning  MT:S , the mobile arm of state-owned Telekom Srbija
AD, which accounted for 38.8 percent of the total, according to
the report by  Agency for Electronic Communications  today. The
third provider,  Telekom Austria (TKA)  AG’s  VIP Mobile , had the
remaining 17.6 percent. The combined revenue was 10 percent
higher than in 2010.  Serbia’s total of mobile clients reached 10.2 million in
2011, pushing the penetration rate to 143 percent. Mobile
services accounted for almost 53 percent of the entire
telecommunications market, which grew to 1.6 billion euros in
2011. Other market segments included fixed lines,  internet
providers , media content distribution and voice-over-Internet
protocol.  MT:S remained the biggest by number of users, even as its
share of clients fell to 53.6 percent from 56 percent in 2010.
Telenor and VIP increased their share of clients to 30.8 percent
and 16.3 percent respectively, from 30.3 percent and 13.7
percent in the previous year.  The changes were a continuing trend from recent years, sped
up in the second half of 2011 when users were enabled to switch
providers without changing mobile phone numbers, the report
said.  “Change of operator became easier with the possibility of
keeping the existing number, which has fostered competition”
and improved service, the agency said. More than 50,000 users
have used the option since it became available on July 1.  Lower rates led to longer voice calls, up by an average
14.8 percent, while there were fewer text and multimedia
messages. The report also showed post-paid continuing to gain
ground against prepaid, reaching 36 percent from 33 percent last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
