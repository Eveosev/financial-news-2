The following is the text of
Canada’s  consumer price index  report for May released
by  Statistics Canada .  Consumer prices rose 1.2% in the 12 months to May,
following a 2.0% increase in April. This 0.8 percentage point
difference was mostly attributable to declines for gasoline
prices. Decreases in clothing prices as well as slower price
gains for the purchase of passenger vehicles were also factors.  The energy index fell 1.6% in the 12 months to May, its
first year-over-year decline since October 2009. Natural  gas
prices  (-16.6%) continued to post declines. Gasoline prices
decreased 2.3%, after 22 months of year-over-year increases. In
contrast, electricity prices continued to rise.  Excluding energy, the Consumer  Price Index  (CPI) rose 1.7%
in the 12 months to May after increasing 2.1% in April. For the
second consecutive month, the CPI excluding energy increased at
a faster rate than the All-items CPI.  12-month change in the major components  The 0.8 percentage point slowdown in the CPI in May was led
by smaller price gains for transportation, as well as price
declines for clothing and footwear.  Transportation costs rose 0.8% in the 12 months to May
after increasing 3.2% in April. This slower rate of increase was
largely the result of year-over-year price declines in gasoline
and, to a lesser extent, smaller price increases for the
purchase of passenger vehicles.  Prices for clothing and footwear were down 0.3% in the 12
months to May, following a 2.4% rise in April. This decrease was
mostly the result of more women’s clothing being discounted in
May 2012 compared with May 2011.  The main upward contributors to the 1.2% rise in the CPI
were higher prices for food and shelter. Prices for food
purchased from stores (+2.5%) and electricity (+5.4%) rose in
the 12 months to May.  12-month change in the provinces  In the 12 months to May, consumer prices rose at a slower
rate in all provinces compared with April. Newfoundland and
Labrador (+2.5%) continued to post the largest increase, while
Alberta (+0.4%) continued to record the lowest.  The decline in gasoline prices was a major factor in the
easing of all provincial CPIs.  The CPI in British Columbia did not ease to the same extent
as those of other provinces, rising 1.3% in the 12 months to May,
following an increase of 1.6% in April. Gasoline prices in
British Columbia decelerated the least of any province.  Seasonally adjusted monthly Consumer Price Index decreases  On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the CPI declined
0.2% in May, after increasing 0.2% in the previous two months.  The seasonally adjusted index for transportation, which
includes gasoline and the purchase of passenger vehicles, fell
1.6%, following a 0.2% increase in April. The clothing and
footwear index declined 0.8% in May, after increasing 1.1% the
previous month.  Bank of Canada’s core index  The Bank of  Canada ’s core index
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/62-001-x/2012005/technote -
notetech2-eng.htm) rose 1.8% in the 12 months to May, following
a 2.1% gain in April. Price gains for electricity, food
purchased from restaurants and meat continued to be main
contributors to the year-over-year increase in the core index.  On a monthly basis, the seasonally adjusted core index was
unchanged in May, after rising 0.4% the previous month.  Note to readers  The special aggregate “Energy” includes: electricity;
natural gas; fuel oil and other fuels; gasoline; and fuel, parts
and supplies for recreational vehicles.  The Bank of Canada’s core index excludes eight of the
Consumer Price Index’s most volatile components (fruit, fruit
preparations and nuts; vegetables and vegetable preparations;
mortgage interest cost; natural gas;  fuel oil  and other fuels;
gasoline; inter-city transportation; and tobacco products and
smokers’ supplies) as well as the effects of changes in indirect
taxes on the remaining components.  To contact the reporter on this story:
