Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  sold $16.1
million of structured notes tied to the debt of banks including
Morgan Stanley with a coupon dependent on the  Thai baht  exchange
rate.  The bank issued $7.02 million of notes linked to debt from
 ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  Bahrain, BNP Paribas SA and Morgan Stanley this
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also sold two
securities tied just to Morgan Stanley for $4.29 million and
$4.75 million.  Bank of America has sold three other credit-linked notes
with coupons linked to the dollar-baht currency pair this year
for $15.54 million, Bloomberg data show.  Thailand’s baht had its biggest weekly decline versus the
dollar since December after the central bank cut the growth
forecast for exports, citing Europe’s debt crisis. The currency
retreated 0.9 percent to 31.8 per dollar as of 5:07 p.m. in
London.  Andrew Todd , a Bank of America spokesman in London,
declined to comment on the structured note issues.  Credit-linked notes are securities with derivatives tied to
the risk of a company or country’s debt and offer higher yields
and tailored maturities that may not be available in the bond
market. Investors suffer losses if there’s a default for either
the bank issuing the note or the reference entity. The coupon
can be tied to an exchange rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
