More than 40 Zimbabwean lawmakers
have volunteered to be circumcised as part of a campaign to
boost AIDS awareness in the southern African nation, said
Lovemore Moyo, the speaker of Parliament.  Legislators are “leading by example” in getting tested
for HIV and being circumcised, Moyo said at a ceremony today in
Harare, the capital, to mark the start of the program.  Zimbabwe has an adult infection rate for HIV, the virus
that causes the fatal disease Aids, of about 15 percent,
according to the National AIDS Council, a state agency. A
circumcision program in  South Africa  found the procedure reduced
the rate of HIV infections among men who had it done by 76
percent, according to a study presented at an AIDS conference in
 Rome  last year.  “Now I can go out and speak clearly and proudly and urge
Zimbabweans that this thing can be done,” Blessing Chebundo, a
lawmaker from central town of Kwekwe, said. “I am more than 50
years old now and I have done it.”  Circumcision is the surgical removal of a skin that covers
the tip of the penis. Studies have shown the pocket between the
foreskin and the tip of the penis gives viruses and bacteria an
area to grow. The foreskin has been shown to be rich in cells
that carry HIV into the body.  To contact the reporter on this story:
