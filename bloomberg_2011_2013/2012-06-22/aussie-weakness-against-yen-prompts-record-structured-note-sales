Nomura Holdings Inc. and
Kommuninvest i Sverige sold two of the largest structured notes
tied to the Australian dollar-Japanese yen  exchange rate  in at
least 13 years.  Nomura sold 31.6 billion yen ($394 million) of one-year
notes tied to the rate on May 23, the largest such deal,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1999.
Sweden’s Kommuninvest issued 27 billion yen of 18-month notes on
June 15, the third-largest.  The Australian dollar, or the Aussie, fell to 75.68 yen on
June 1, the lowest since Nov. 25, as a report of poor retail
sales added to speculation that the country’s central bank would
cut  interest rates . Japanese investors viewed the decline below
80 yen after May 11 as an opportunity to bet on the Aussie to
gain again, said David Naville, head of foreign exchange
structuring for the Asia-Pacific area at Barclays Plc.  Breaching the 80 yen level “has surely motivated investors
to re-enter the trade,” Hong Kong-based Naville said. Barclays
sold 46 notes for 9.89 billion yen linked to the exchange rate
this year, Bloomberg data show.  The Aussie lost 0.9 percent in the past three months
against a basket that includes nine developed-market peers,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. That was
the third worst performance after the euro and Swiss franc.  ‘Significant Weakening’  This week it has gained 0.6 percent to 80.575 yen, after
the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  said in minutes released June 18
that recent domestic data hadn’t shown a “significant
weakening” compared with the prior month’s forecasts. The
country’s central bank concluded the domestic economy was
holding up as global prospects worsened, minutes of its June 5
meeting showed.  Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at UBS in  London , said
the Aussie could strengthen to about 85 yen at the end of 2012.
Bids on non-deliverable forward contracts, however, predict a
weakening to 79.12 by year’s end and to 71.27 by June 2015,
according to Bloomberg data.  There have been 160.3 billion yen of notes linked to the
exchange rate issued this year, Bloomberg data show. The most
were sold in March, 51.9 billion yen in 23 offerings. The Aussie
could buy as much as 88.4 yen on March 19, its highest point in
the year to date, making notes linked to the strength of the
Australian currency more attractive.  Buyers of the note issued by Nomura in May receive a 3.5
percent coupon and are repaid their principal in Australian
dollars if the exchange rate drops below about 67 yen, according
to a term sheet for the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
