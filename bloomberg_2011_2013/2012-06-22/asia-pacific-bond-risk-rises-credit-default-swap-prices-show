The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  gained 4 basis points to 181 basis
points as of 8:21 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to  Credit
Agricole SA. (ACA)  The gauge is set for its highest close since June
14, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index climbed 4 basis points to 187
as of 9:41 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
measure is headed for its highest close since June 8, according
to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index rose 1 basis point to 186
basis points as of 10:13 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank
Ltd. (NAB)  according to NAB prices. The benchmark is on track to
increase about 38 basis points since April 1, the prices show.
It would be the first quarterly gain since the period ended
September, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
