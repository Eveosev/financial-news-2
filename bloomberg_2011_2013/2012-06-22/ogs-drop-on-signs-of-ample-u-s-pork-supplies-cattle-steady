Hog futures dropped for a fourth
straight day, the longest slump in a month, on signs of ample
supplies of U.S. pork. Cattle prices were little changed.  Commercial-pork production last month totaled 1.93 billion
pounds (873,982 metric tons), up 9.5 percent from May 2011, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today. Output in the five
months through May 31 was up 3.9 percent from the same period a
year earlier, government data show. The USDA will report cold-
storage inventories for May at 3 p.m. in  Washington .  “With the production figures, and with the cold-storage
report this afternoon, the general consensus is that there’s
ample product right now,” Adam Stout, a risk-management
consultant at FCStone Group Inc. in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , said
in a telephone interview.  Hog futures for August settlement fell 0.8 percent to
91.425 cents a pound at 10:19 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching 90.875, the lowest for the most-active
contract since June 13. The commodity is up 9.3 percent this
year through yesterday.  Average carcass  weights  in the U.S. rose 0.4 percent to
204.11 pounds (92.6 kilograms) on June 20, USDA data show.
That’s 1.7 pounds heavier than a year earlier.  Cattle futures for August delivery slid less than 0.1
percent to $1.16525 a pound in  Chicago . Prices fell 4 percent
this year through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.3
percent to $1.5225 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
