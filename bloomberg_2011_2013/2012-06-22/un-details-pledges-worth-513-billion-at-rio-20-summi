Countries and companies have made
692 pledges totalling $513 billion to push efforts to curb the
use of fossil fuels, conserve water and encourage wider use of
renewable energy, part of a global effort to promote economic
growth that doesn’t strain the planet’s resources, the  United
Nations  said today.  The value of the promises was disclosed by Sha Zukang,
secretary-general of the UN’s Rio+20 summit on sustainable
development in  Rio de Janeiro . The June 20-22 conference, the
UN’s biggest, drew 45,381 official delegates and thousands more
who attended side events and protests around the Brazilian city.  “These voluntary commitments are a major part of the
legacy of this conference,” Zukang said. “The numerous
commitments bring together key actors united behind the same
cause to achieve sustainable development.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
