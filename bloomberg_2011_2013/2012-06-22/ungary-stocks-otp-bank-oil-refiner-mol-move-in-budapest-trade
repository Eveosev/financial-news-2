The benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index fell for a
third consecutive day, down 1.5 percent to 17,232.59 by the end
of trading in Budapest, capping a 0.1 percent weekly drop.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  ,  Hungary ’s largest lender,
retreated 4.1 percent to 3,535 forint in the biggest slump in
almost a month. German business confidence fell to the lowest in
more than two years in June as the worsening sovereign debt
crisis clouded the economic outlook for Hungary’s biggest
trading partner.  CIG Pannonia Eletbiztosito Nyrt. (PANNONIA HB), a Hungarian
life insurer, rose 3 percent to 305 forint, the only stock in
the 11-member BUX basket to rise more than 1 percent today. The
European Union is considering phasing in new capital rules for
the life insurance industry over seven years, easing the burden
on insurers who had criticized the changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
