Citigroup Inc. (C) , the U.S. bank
downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service to the lowest level in
14 years yesterday, named Helio Magalhaes as country officer of
its Brazilian unit.  Magalhaes, who will replace Gustavo Marin, will report to
Francisco Aristeguieta, the lender’s chief executive officer for
 Latin America , according to an e-mailed statement. He joined
Citigroup after 13 years in several positions at American
Express Credit Corp., including president of the Brazilian
division.  “We count on Helio’s experience to further expand our
presence in Brazil, establishing strong client relationships and
driving growth in the country,” Manuel Medina-Mora, chief
executive officer for global consumer banking and chairman of
Mexico and Latin America, said in the statement.  Citigroup is the 11th largest bank in Brazil with 55.9
billion reais ($27.1 billion) in assets at the end of March,
according to data from the central bank. The company has 7,000
employees and 101 branches in Brazil, according to the
statement.  Marin has served as country officer for Brazil since 2005,
according to the statement. His new duties at Citigroup aren’t
set yet, Claudia Lima, a Citigroup spokeswoman for Latin
America, said in a telephone interview from Miami.  To contact the reporters on this story:
