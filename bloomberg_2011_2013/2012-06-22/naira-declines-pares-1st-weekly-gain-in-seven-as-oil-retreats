The naira weakened against the
dollar, paring its first weekly advance in seven as oil,
 Nigeria ’s key export, slid amid signals of a fall in demand on
reports showing the global economic slowdown is deepening.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.3 percent to 162.615 per dollar as of 2:30 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has strengthened 0.5 percent this
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigerian benchmark  Bonny Light crude  retreated for a sixth
straight day to $89.71 a barrel, a 30 percent fall from its
March peak this year. Oil in  New York  tumbled below $80 a barrel
and  Brent crude  fell under $90 a barrel yesterday as reports
added to concern that demand will slow amid rising supplies.  As Bonny Light declines “the market could be excused for
showing some nerves,” Gregory Kronsten and Olubunmi Asaolu,
strategists at FBN Capital Ltd. in  London , wrote in an e-mailed
note today.  German business confidence fell to a two-year low, the
Munich-based Ifo institute said today after data yesterday
showed that U.S. manufacturing shrank and home sales declined.
Moody’s Investors Service cut ratings for Credit Suisse Group AG
and 14 other banks, while the  International Monetary Fund  said
Europe’s crisis has reached a “critical stage.”  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold  $750 million  at two
foreign-currency auctions this week, the most since the five
days to Oct. 12. The Abuja-based regulator, which is the biggest
supplier of dollars to the market, sells on Mondays and
Wednesdays to support the naira.  Inflation Falls  Nigeria’s  inflation rate  fell to 12.7 percent in May from
12.9 percent in April, the National Bureau of Statistics said
June 19, staying above the central bank’s target and adding to
investor expectations interest rates will remain unchanged at a
record high of 12 percent.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic bonds due 2019 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 15.63 percent,
according to the June 21 data on the Financial Markets Dealers
Association website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million of
Eurobonds due 2021 fell one basis point to 5.57 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.3 percent to 1.9325 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
