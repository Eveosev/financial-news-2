German  home prices  in cities
including Hamburg and Munich may be overheating, according to a
government letter seen by Bloomberg.  Values in some parts of the cities have risen
significantly, Deputy Finance Minister Hartmut Koschyk said in a
written response to questions by  Gerhard Schick , a parliament
member for the opposition  Green Party .  “In some local segments of these cities, there may
possibly be some first signs of overshooting,” said the letter
addressed to Norbert Lammert, president of the Bundestag.  The German real estate market has been one of the biggest
beneficiaries of the European credit crisis, as investors are
drawn by the country’s growing economy and low  interest rates .
Prices of apartments in Hamburg and Munich jumped 22.5 percent
in the last two years, according to data compiled by Berlin-
based online brokerage Immobilien Scout 24. Prices nationwide
rose 9.3 percent in that period.  In Germany as a whole, home-price increases and mortgage
lending growth has been moderate and a bubble is far from
developing, Koschyk’s letter said. Price gains so far don’t
threaten the stability of the financial system, it said.  Koschyk sent the letter, dated June 4, on behalf of the
German government in response to questions from Schick. Its
contents were first reported by German newspaper Die Zeit on
June 20. An official at the  Finance Ministry  declined to 
comment on the letter’s content.  To contact the reporter on this story:
