European Union nations may scrap
plans to set uniform rules on the right of overseas-based
investment companies to offer services inside the 27-nation
bloc.  Officials from a number of governments have called for the
plan to be abandoned,  Denmark , which holds the rotating EU
presidency, said in a document posted on the EU website. The
measure was unveiled last year by  Michel Barnier , the EU’s
financial services commissioner, as part of a broader overhaul
of the bloc’s market regulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
