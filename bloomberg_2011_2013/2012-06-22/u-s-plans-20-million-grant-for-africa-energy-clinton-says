Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said the U.S. will provide $20 million in grants for clean-
energy projects in Africa, funds that will unlock additional
loans from the Overseas Private Investment Corp.  “Investors in this space often see obstacles and risks
that stop them from investing in this clean-energy space,”
Clinton said at a briefing in Rio de Janeiro today. “If we
remove some of the risks and cover some of the costs we can spur
significant investment.”  The funds add to $2 billion the U.S. set aside last year to
support clean-energy projects in  developing countries , Clinton
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
