The European Union is claiming back
426 million euros ($535 million) of  farm subsidies  “unduly
spent” by member states, including 251.5 million euros from
Spain,  Italy  and  Greece  for wrongly planting wine grapes.  The claims stem from failing to adhere to EU rules or a
lack of controls on farm spending, the European Commission wrote
in an online statement today. The charges include 71.5 million
euros from Greece for “weaknesses in the controls of dried
grapes,” the EU’s regulatory arm said.  The 27-nation bloc’s agriculture budget for 2012 amounts to
56.8 billion euros including funds for rural development, its
 data  show. The EU typically withholds reclaimed money from
future payments made as part of the Common Agricultural Policy.  “The commission has adopted a regulation allowing member
states under financial assistance to delay, on certain
conditions, the reimbursement of disallowed funds for up to 18
months,” the Commission wrote.  Spain  was charged 131.3 million euros for planting vines
without plantation rights, Italy was ordered to refund 98.9
million euros for the same reason and Greece 21.3 million euros,
according to the statement. The commission is claiming back 62.9
million euros from  France  for deficiencies in controls of
payments to cattle farmers.  Greece must pay back a further 11.6 million euros for a
lack of controls on sugar production and storage. The commission
is claiming money from a total of 13 countries, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
