Ethanol rose as corn capped the
biggest weekly gain since May 2011 on speculation that warm, dry
weather will stress crops next week.  The biofuel gained as the corn contract with the most
interest soared 9.5 percent this week to $5.54 a bushel, raising
the cost of ethanol production.  Producers are losing 8 cents on every gallon of ethanol
made, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) , the third-largest U.S. ethanol producer, this week idled
output at its 110 million-gallon-a-year plant in Albion,
 Nebraska , as the biofuel struggles to keep pace with corn costs.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.07 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
have fallen 6 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.125 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel
added 0.5 cents, to $2.16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  jumped 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.09
a gallon and in Chicago the additive increased 0.5 cent to
$2.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
