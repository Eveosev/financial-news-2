Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Afinitor treatment was
recommended for an additional indication for  breast cancer  by
the European Union’s drug regulator.  Afinitor may be used for post-menopausal women with the
HER2 receptor gene in combination with the generic drug
exemestane, the London-based European Medicines Agency said in a
 statement  today.  The treatment is approved in the U.S. and  Europe  for
cancers of the kidney and pancreas, and in the U.S. for non-
cancerous brain tumors. Approval for the drug in breast cancer
could add more than $1 billion to annual sales, Basel,
Switzerland-based Novartis has said.  In a trial among 724 women whose cancer had progressed
after hormone therapy, 25 percent of those receiving a
combination of Afinitor and  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Aromasin had died
after 18 months, compared with 32 percent of patients receiving
Aromasin plus a placebo, Novartis said on May 31.  The regulator’s recommendations are the final stage before
the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, approves or
rejects a drug for sale to patients in the 27-nation bloc. The
commission usually accepts the agency’s advice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
