  European (SXXP)  stocks rose for a third
week as Greece formed a coalition government of parties prepared
to abide by the terms of the country’s two bailouts, increasing
optimism that the nation will remain in the euro.  Air France-KLM  Group rallied 17 percent after announcing a
plan to cut jobs at its Air France unit. Aer Lingus Group Plc

Plc (RYA) , which added 5.5 percent. Danone plunged 8.4 percent after

than two years. The equity benchmark has  risen 5.4 percent from

estimated earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Greek election takes a bit of pressure off the debt
crisis,” said  Mike Lenhoff , chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin
Securities Ltd. in  London , “The immediate implication is that
it diminishes the risk of Greece leaving the  euro zone  and of
contagion. The ground’s being laid out for some more progress.”  Antonis Samaras, leader of Greece’s  New Democracy  party,
became prime minister on June 20 after agreeing to form a
coalition with the Socialist Pasok party and the Democratic
Left. New Democracy won the June 17 election -- Greece’s second

dropped more than economists had estimated. The gauge, based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, slipped to 105.3 in June from
106.9 in May, its lowest reading since March 2010. Economists
had predicted a decline to 105.6, according to the  median of 39
estimates  in a Bloomberg News survey.  Federal Reserve  In the U.S., the  Federal Reserve  cut its forecast on June
20 for the world’s largest economy, predicting growth of 1.9

2.4 percent to 2.9 percent. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
progress in the labor market has slowed.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  extended its Operation

Plc and Markit Economics on June 21 gave a preliminary reading
of 48.1 for this month, indicating that manufacturing in the

Readings below 50 mean the industry contracted.  A gauge of travel and leisure company shares posted the
 best performance  of the 19 industries on the Stoxx 600 this past
week. Air France-KLM rallied 17 percent after saying on June 21
that it will eliminate more than 5,000 jobs, equivalent to 10

percent this past week.  Danone slumped 8.4 percent after the company said on June

2012 on a like-for-like basis. The maker of Actimel yogurt had
forecast a stable margin.  Royal KPN NV plunged 10 percent, its biggest weekly decline
since October 2008, after abandoning talks on June 20 to combine
its German business with a rival. That enabled  Carlos Slim ’s
