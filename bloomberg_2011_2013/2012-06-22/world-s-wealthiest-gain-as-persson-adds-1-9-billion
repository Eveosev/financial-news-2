The world’s wealthiest people added
a combined $3 billion to their collective net worth this week as
Swedish retail tycoon  Stefan Persson , 64, became the third-
richest man in Europe.  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , Europe’s second-largest clothing
retailer, surged 9.62 percent for the week after the company
posted its biggest profit increase in seven quarters. Persson’s
fortune jumped $1.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg
Billionaires Index. He is worth $24.2 billion, $16.1 billion
behind  Amancio Ortega  of Spain.  Persson’s rise came as Greece’s parliamentary elections
failed to convince investors that politicians will be able to
tame Europe’s financial woes.  “Spain is weighing heavily on investor sentiment,” said
Kristen Scarpa, a New York-based investment strategist at
Barclays Wealth Management, in a June 22 e-mail. “Its troubled
banks remain on the hook as the buyer of last resort for
government debt, feeding investor fears about whether Spain the
sovereign will be next in line.”  Spain’s 10-year yield rose to a record high of 7.29 percent
on June 18, after an increase in bad Spanish loans fueled
concern the debt crisis is deepening. On June 22, the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s economic index reported the worst
contraction in manufacturing in almost a year, while other
reports showed existing home sales decreased more than forecast
and jobless claims topped estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.58 percent for
the week to close at 1,335.02 in New York. The Stoxx Europe 600
Index climbed 0.97 percent, closing at 246.58.  Slim, Buffett  Carlos Slim , 72, remains No. 1 in the world with a net
worth of $69.1 billion. The telecommunications tycoon gained
$2.55 billion in the week, as shares of his Mexico City-based
wireless carrier America Movil SAB leapt 4.05 percent.  On June 21, the company disclosed it had increased its
stake in Royal KPN NV, the former Dutch phone monopoly, to 21
percent, up from 8.7 percent. Slim, who agreed to acquire 21
percent of  Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  on June 15, is taking advantage of
distressed prices in Europe to expand America Movil’s assets
beyond Latin America, where it’s the biggest carrier.  Bill Gates  is almost $8 billion behind Slim. The 56-year-
old  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  co-founder’s fortune eked out a $256 million
gain as shares of the Redmond, Washington-based company rose
2.27 percent. Microsoft unveiled its Surface tablet computer on
June 18, to compete with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad. Number three on the
index is Warren Buffett, 81, with a net worth of $45.7 billion.  Eike Batista , Brazil’s richest man, agreed to sell a 49
percent stake in his AUX gold business to the Qatar Investment
Authority for about $2 billion. The mining and energy magnate
decided to sell the AUX stake after shelving plans to take the
company public. The 55-year-old saw his fortune drop 3.3
percent, to $24.5 billion. He ranks 13th on the list.  Ellison’s Island  The fortune of  Mark Zuckerberg , Chief Executive Officer of
 Facebook Inc. (FB) , the world’s most-popular social networking
company, has soared 22 percent in the past two weeks. Facebook’s
rally has helped the company avoid posting the biggest slump
among the largest U.S. initial public offerings since the
beginning of 2011. The 28-year-old ranks 34th in the world with
a net worth of $16.8 billion.  Larry Ellison , the 67-year-old chief executive officer of
Redwood City, California-based  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , filed an
application to buy 98 percent of the Hawaiian island of Lanai on
June 19.  Hawaii’s sixth-largest island includes two resort hotels,
two championship golf courses and club houses, more than 88,000
acres of land, including a 600-acre residential development, a
solar farm and parks.  The transaction is valued in the “hundreds of millions of
dollars,” according to the application filed with Hawaii’s
Public Utilities Commission. The software mogul gained $415
million this week as shares of Oracle rose 1.08 percent. He
ranks sixth on the list.  The Bloomberg Billionaires Index takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
