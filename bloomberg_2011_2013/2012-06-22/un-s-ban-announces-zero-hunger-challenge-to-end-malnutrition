United Nations Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon announced a “Zero Hunger Challenge” to rid the world
of malnutrition.  Almost 1 billion people in the world don’t have enough to
eat, Ban said in a video message to the Rio+20 summit in Rio de
Janeiro yesterday, according to a transcript published by the
UN. The UN chief, 68, said he wants to see an end to hunger
“within my lifetime.”  “In a world of plenty, no one, not a single person, should
go hungry,” Ban said. “I invite you all to join me in working
for a future without hunger.”  Ending hunger would boost economic growth, reduce poverty
and help protect the environment, as well as foster peace and
stability, Ban said. The UN’s Food & Agriculture Organization
estimates there are about 900 million hungry people, 13 percent
of the world population.  “This is the first big idea on food to come out of the
Rio+20 debacle,” Barbara Stocking, chief executive officer
of hunger-fighting charity Oxfam, said in an e-mailed statement.
“But it is in total contrast to the lack of any action in the
summit conclusions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
