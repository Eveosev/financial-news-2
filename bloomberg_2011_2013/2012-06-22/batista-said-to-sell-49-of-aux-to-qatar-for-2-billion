Billionaire  Eike Batista , Brazil’s
richest man, is selling a 49 percent stake in his AUX gold

according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  EBX Group Co., Batista’s Rio de Janeiro-based holding
company, decided to sell a stake in AUX after shelving plans to
take the company public. AUX mines for gold in  Colombia . Batista
told reporters yesterday in Rio that he had sold an AUX stake
without disclosing the buyer or the price.  An EBX official in Rio declined to comment. A call to a
Dubai-based official of the Qatar Investment Authority outside
of business hours wasn’t answered, while a representative for
the fund in  London  declined to comment.  “Sovereign wealth funds are interested in investing in
real assets” such as gold, the 55-year-old mining and energy
magnate, whose investments range from  iron ore  to coal, told
reporters on Feb. 15. AUX paid C$1.08 billion ($1.05 billion)
last year to buy Ventana Gold Corp.  AUX is worth $5 billion, Batista said in October, and has
7.2 million ounces of  gold reserves  after the acquisition of
Vancouver-based Ventana in March 2011. AUX’s La Bodega mine,
located 400 kilometers (248 miles) northeast of Bogota, also has
