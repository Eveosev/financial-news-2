Pacific Investment Management Co.’s
 Neel Kashkari , who heads global equities at the Newport Beach,
California-based investment firm, said downgrades of banks by
Moody’s Investors Service weren’t of consequence for the firm.  “For Pimco, it was a non-factor,” Kashkari said today in
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop with Betty
Liu.” The firm takes risk “exceptionally seriously” and does
its own credit work on a bank by bank basis before trading,
Kashkari said.  Credit Suisse Group AG’s credit rating was cut three levels
by Moody’s, Morgan Stanley was reduced two levels and 13 other
banks were downgraded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
