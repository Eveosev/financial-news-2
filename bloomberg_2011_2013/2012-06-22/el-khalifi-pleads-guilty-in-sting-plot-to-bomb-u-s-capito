Moroccan immigrant Amine El Khalifi
pleaded guilty to attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction
in a suicide bombing at the U.S. Capitol.  Khalifi, 29, entered the plea today before U.S. District
Judge James Cacheris in Alexandria,  Virginia , in exchange for a
prison sentence of 25 years to 30 years,  Peter Carr , a spokesman
for the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office, said. Prosecutors will seek a
30-year term at his sentencing hearing on Sept. 14, Carr said.
The charge carries a possible sentence of imprisonment for life.  Khalifi, who was caught in an FBI sting operation, was
arrested in a parking garage near the Capitol on Feb. 17 after
meeting with an undercover agent posing as a member of an armed
extremist group.  He was taken into custody as he began walking toward the
Capitol carrying a MAC-10 automatic weapon and wearing a vest
containing what he believed to be a functioning bomb, according
to an affidavit filed in the case by Steven Hersem, an agent of
the  Federal Bureau of Investigation . The weapons, both of which
were provided by the government, had been made inoperable by
investigators, prosecutors said.  A Moroccan national, El Khalifi entered the U.S. in June
1999 on a tourist visa that expired later that year. He has
lived in the U.S. illegally since then, according to the
affidavit.  The case U.S. v. El Khalifi, 12-mj-00087, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria).  To contact the reporter on this story:
