U.S. 10-year notes stayed little
changed after a report showed German business confidence fell to
the lowest in more than two years in June.  The  securities  yielded 1.62 percent as of 9:06 a.m. London
time. The nation’s 30-year yield was also little changed at 2.69
percent.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said today its business
climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, dropped
for a second straight month to 105.3 from 106.9 in May. That’s
the lowest reading since March 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
