Chinese wireless technology
companies fell in  New York , sending the benchmark index to its
first decline in three weeks, on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
will curb global demand for smartphones.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in New York lost 1.2 percent last week to
90.30, led by a 9.7 slump in  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (CHU) 
 Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD) , a Shanghai-based mobile-phone
chip designer, dropped for the first time in five weeks.  Cnooc
Ltd. (883) , China’s largest offshore explorer, posted the biggest
retreat in six weeks.  European finance ministers quarreled last week over the
strategy to contain the debt crisis, with creditor countries
resisting leniency for  Greece  as data showed German business
confidence fell to the lowest in more than two years in June.
Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC Corp. reduced its sales forecast
this month after demand in Europe fell short of the company’s
forecast and Nomura Holdings Inc. cut revenue estimates for
Nokia Oyj’s handsets on June 22.  “Weakness in Europe’s macroeconomy impacts high-end
smartphone demand, and companies have lowered their sales
forecast for this year,” Jun Zhang, an analyst at Wedge
Partners Corp. in  Greenwood Village , Colorado said by phone on
June 22. “Spreadtrum’s stock slump and slower-than-expected
growth in Unicom’s 3G users reflected investors’ recent weak
sentiment toward the smartphone market.”  Slowing Growth  The Bloomberg China gauge added 0.4 percent on June 22. The
 iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese exchange-
traded fund in the U.S., tumbled 5.6 percent last week to
$32.53. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of mainland stocks fell 1.4
percent to a three-week low of 2,260.88 before a public holiday
June 22. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares climbed
0.7 percent to 1,335.02, trimming a decline for the week to 0.6
percent.  American depositary receipts of China Unicom, the nation’s
second-largest wireless carrier, sank to $12.60 last week, the
biggest weekly loss since July 2009.  Beijing-based China Unicom added 2.7 million users for its
third-generation service last month, down from 2.9 million new
customers in April and the smallest monthly gain since
September, according to a June 19 filing. The company’s total
54.5 million of 3G users compared with 64.3 million at China
Mobile Ltd., the nation’s biggest wireless operator.  Cheaper Smartphones  Unicom will introduce smartphones costing less than 700
 yuan  ($110) in China in the near future, 30 percent less than
the cheapest devices it currently offers, President Lu Yimin
told the GSMA Mobile Asia Expo in Shanghai June 20, without
providing a more specific time frame.  China Telecom Corp. (CHA) , the country’s third largest mobile-
phone carrier, slumped 5 percent last week to $43.42 in New
York, the lowest level since June 5.  Spreadtrum’s ADRs retreated 6.2 percent last week in New
York to $18.04, snapping a four-week rally.  LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the world’s second-largest maker of wafers,
dropped 7.4 percent to $2.12 on June 22, the biggest one-day
slump in almost four weeks.  The company, based in Xinyu, in China’s Jiangxi province,
is scheduled to report first-quarter results on June 26. The
maker of solar wafers has lost money for three straight
quarters. The company’s total debt increased 34 percent to $6
billion in 2011, Bloomberg data show.  ‘Very Challenging’  “The market conditions are very challenging and there’s
still very little profit being made,”  David Smith , the
portfolio manager of the Gabelli Green Fund, said in a phone
interview from Purchase, New York, on June 22. “The company is
extremely leveraged.”  LDK will report a loss of $1.14 per share in the first
quarter, according to the  average estimate  of three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, after losing $4.63 in the last quarter of
2011. LDK forecast April 30 first-quarter sales of between $190
million and $230 million, down from $420 million in the previous
three months. Analysts predicted sales to drop 71 percent from a
year ago to $223.5 million.  Cnooc’s ADRs fell 0.3 percent to $185.86 on June 22, ending
the week’s retreat to 6.3 percent.  Focus Media Holding Ltd. (FMCN) , a Shanghai-based digital
advertising company, jumped 5.4 percent to $21.50 on June 22.  Short sale interest  in the company’s stock fell to a record
low 1.8 percent of total shares outstanding, according to  Data
Explorers , a New York-based research firm. In a short sale, an
investor borrows a security and sells it, expecting to profit
from a decline by repurchasing it later at a lower price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
