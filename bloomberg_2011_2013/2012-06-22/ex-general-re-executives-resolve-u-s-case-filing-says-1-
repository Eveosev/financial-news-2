Four former executives at General
Reinsurance Corp. and one at  American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
facing a retrial on accounting fraud charges, reached a
resolution of the criminal case, according to a court filing.  The filing today by the U.S. Justice Department in federal
court in Connecticut doesn’t specify the resolution with
prosecutors.  Former General Re Chief Executive Officer Ronald Ferguson,
ex-Chief Financial Officer Elizabeth Monrad, ex-Senior Vice
President Christopher Garand, ex-Assistant General Counsel
Robert Graham, and former AIG Vice President Christian Milton
faced a Jan. 22 retrial on charges of defrauding AIG investors.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in New York in August ordered a
new trial, reversing the executives’ 2008 convictions.
Prosecutors said their scheme involved a sham transaction in
2000 and 2001 to inflate AIG’s loss reserves by $500 million.  The case is U.S. v. Ferguson, 06-cr-137, U.S. District
Court, District of  Connecticut  (Hartford).  To contact the reporter on this story:
