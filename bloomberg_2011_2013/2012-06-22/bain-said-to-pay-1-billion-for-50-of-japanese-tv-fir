private-equity firm co-founded by  Mitt Romney , will acquire 50
percent of Japan’s Jupiter Shop Channel Co., said the stake’s
owner,  Sumitomo Corp. (8053)   The deal is valued at more than $1 billion, according to a
person familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be
identified because the terms weren’t disclosed.  Charlyn Lusk, a spokeswoman for Bain at Stanton Public
Relations & Marketing, declined to comment.  Jupiter Shop plans to expand in  Asia  as the continent’s
middle class continues to grow. The company’s television channel,
which markets items such as home appliances and cosmetics to
millions of households, controls 30 percent of Japan’s TV
shopping market, according to a statement today from Sumitomo.  Founded in 1996, the company has “consistently increased
its revenues” and is planning to expand into  China  with Bain’s
help, according to the statement.  Bain, started in 1984 by Romney and partners from the
consulting firm Bain & Co., oversees about $60 billion in assets.
The firm deployed $15.3 billion across 33 transactions last year,
including the takeover of Tokyo restaurant operator Skylark Co.
in a deal valued at $3.4 billion, according to London-based
researcher  Preqin Ltd .  Bain will pay $1.3 billion, Reuters reported earlier today,
citing a person with direct knowledge of the firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
