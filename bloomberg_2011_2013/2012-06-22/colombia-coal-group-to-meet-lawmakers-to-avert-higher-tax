Coal producers in  Colombia , South
Americaâ€™s largest supplier of the mineral, will meet with
lawmakers in a bid to avert a proposed tax increase that they
claim would discourage investment.  Officials from the  National Federation of Coal Producers 
will meet with congressional leaders next week to lobby against
the proposal, Federation President Jaime Olivella said today in
an interview in central Colombia. The tax on coal mining is
currently about 10 percent.  Governments from  Australia  to  Chile  have sought to raise
mining taxes as Chinese-led demand boosts the consumption of
metals and minerals. Higher levies threaten to erode profit at
mining companies hit by a slump in coal prices, Olivella said.  Global coal supply will expand about 8 percent annually
this year and next as demand slows, Standard Chartered Plc said
in a report June 14.  Production in Colombia will rise to between 97 million and
100 million metric tons this year from almost 86 million tons
last year, Olivella said. Companies developing expansion plans
include Drummond Co. and Cerrejon, a mine owned by  Xstrata Plc (XTA) ,
 Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and BHP Billiton Plc  Investment in roads, ports and trains to transport coal are
needed to help meet a government target to produce 115 million
tons in 2014, Olivella said. Coal producers will have to meet
stricter environmental rules after a government regulator
limited some production increases because of air pollution,
Olivella said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
