Syrian security forces killed 144
people yesterday, a rights group said, making it one of the
bloodiest days in recent weeks in President Bashar al-Assadâ€™s
crackdown on opposition groups.  More than 30 of the deaths came in the central region of
Homs, and another 29 in Daraa in the south, the U.K.-based
Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights  said in an e-mailed
statement today. It said at least 54 soldiers also died.  The Observatory said that Syrian forces shelled towns in
the northern Idlib region today, while protests were held in
Aleppo, the second-biggest city, which is near the Turkish
border. Homs also came under heavy artillery fire again, Al
Arabiya television reported.  Syrian opponents of Assad began protests against his rule
in March last year, and are increasingly taking up arms against
his security forces after 15 months of repression that has left
more than 10,000 people dead, according to United Nations
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
