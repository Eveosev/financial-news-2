Corporacion Andina de Fomento , the
Latin American  development bank , and  Brazil ’s government agency
Finep will provide $200 million to researchers of clean-energy
technologies to help startup companies bring products to market.  The institutions will accept proposals in September for as
much as 4 million reais ($1.94 million) from companies studying
power plants that cater to isolated communities in the Amazon,
Alice Abreu, head of international cooperation at Finep, said
today in a telephone interview.  Early-stage companies in  Latin America  often lack the
financial resources to turn ideas into pilot projects and later
patented technologies, she said.  “We’ll help companies get ideas off the ground and
progress all the way to the commercialization stage,” she said.
“Getting your technology patented is a crucial part of that
process.”  CAF and Finep, formerly known as Financiadora de Estudos e
Projetos, will each furnish $100 million of grants and loans
through 2015, she said.  The two lenders will hold more calls for proposals in the
future and still need to agree on the cost of the financing, she
said.  “We both lend at different rates,” she said. CAF, based
in Caracas, offers loans with annual interest rates of about 12
percent while Finep may lend at rates as low as 4 percent.  3622318Z BZ
