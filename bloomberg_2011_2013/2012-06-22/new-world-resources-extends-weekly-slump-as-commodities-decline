New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, declined for a third day as data
from China to Europe and the U.S. signaled a global economic
slowdown, hurting investor demand for commodities.  The stock dropped 1.9 percent to 99.1 koruna by 10:12 a.m.
in  Prague , extending its losses this week to 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
