A former  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  lobbyist
was charged in Austria with  money laundering  and perjury in
relation to allegations he paid bribes to officials in eastern
and central Europe for weapons contracts.  Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly received 12.6 million euros that
had been withdrawn from the London-based defense contractor
through fake contracts, Thomas Vecsey, a spokesman for Austrian
prosecutors said in a statement.  U.K. prosecutors dropped similar charges against Mensdorff-
Pouilly in 2010 as part of a joint U.K. and U.S. settlement of a
six-year-old bribery and fraud investigation against the
company. Mensdorff’s lawyer, Harald Schuster, said the
allegations are “old hat” and that his client is innocent.  The money Mensdorff-Pouilly received from the company was
probably used to bribe decision makers in central and eastern
 Europe , prosecutors said in the statement. Mensdorff was also
charged with giving false testimony to prosecutors and to a
parliamentary investigation.  Leonie Foster, a spokeswoman for BAE Systems, said that the
company had no comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
