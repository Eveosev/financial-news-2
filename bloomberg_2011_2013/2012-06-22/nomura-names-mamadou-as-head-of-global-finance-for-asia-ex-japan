Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  appointed
Daniel Mamadou as head of global finance for Asia outside Japan,
according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  Mamadou, who was previously co-head of capital markets
treasury solutions for Asia at Deutsche Bank AG, joined Nomura
in November to run the corporate solutions and financing group,
the memo showed.  Rob Stewart , a spokesman for Nomura in Hong
Kong, confirmed the documentâ€™s contents.  Mamadou will also keep his existing role and will report to
 Mark Williams  -- who yesterday was promoted to head of
investment banking for Asia outside Japan -- and to Philippe Dufournier, head of global finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
