Turkey appointed Mukim Oztekin,
formerly of Islamic banks  Albaraka Turk Katilim Bankasi AS (ALBRK)  and
 Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB) , chief of the country’s banking
regulator.  The decision to hire Oztekin for five years was published
in the Ankara-based Official Gazette today. He last worked as a
board member of the Savings and Deposits Insurance Fund, which
manages the assets of failed banks, according to state-run
Anatolia news agency. He also worked at  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi
AS (GARAN) , the country’s biggest bank by market value.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government, rooted in
an Islamic movement banned from politics in 1997, and other
institutions have broken with Turkey’s staunchly secular
traditions by seeking to appoint Islamic bankers to key
positions in the state. The central bank hired Sabri Orman, an
expert on Islamic economic thought, to its board in November.
Former President Ahmet Necdet Sezer rejected Erdogan’s
appointment of an Islamic banker as central bank chief in 2006.  Sakir Ercan Gul was appointed chairman of the Savings
Deposit Insurance Fund for a second five-year term, according to
today’s announcement. Gul previously worked at state-run Turkiye
Halk Bankasi AS and the Finance Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
