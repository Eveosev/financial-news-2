U.S. gasoline, diesel, heating oil
and jet-fuel consumption edged higher in May, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said.  Deliveries of gasoline, a measure of usage, rose 0.4
percent to 8.82 million barrels a day last month from May 2011,
the industry-funded group said today in a report. Demand for
total petroleum products increased 0.5 percent to 18.5 million
barrels a day in May.  “Despite the positive movement, fuel demand is still not
strong,”  John Felmy , chief economist with the Washington-based
API, said in the report. “Weak growth in the U.S., stubborn
unemployment and a world economy doing little better than
treading water are contributing to this. Gradually improving
vehicle fuel efficiency may also be a factor.”  Consumption of distillate fuel, the category that includes
heating oil and diesel, rose 2 percent to 3.73 million barrels a
day last month. Use of ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used on
highways, climbed 1.6 percent to average 3.42 million barrels a
day. Heating-oil demand gained 9.3 percent to 301,000 barrels a
day in May, compared with the same month in 2011.  Jet fuel consumption climbed 1.4 percent to 1.45 million
barrels a day last month, according to the API.  Consumption of residual fuels tumbled 20 percent to 381,000
barrels a day last month, the report showed. Residual fuel is
used for commercial and industrial heating, electricity
generation and ship propulsion.  U.S. crude-oil production increased 8.5 percent to 6.13
million barrels a day in May. Output in the lower 48 states rose
10 percent to 5.56 million barrels a day. Alaskan production
slipped 5 percent to 571,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
