Emerging-market stock funds posted a
net outflow for the sixth week in seven as signs of slowing
growth in China and Germany combined with Spainâ€™s banking
crisis, according to EPFR Global.  Developing-nation equity funds registered an outflow of
$216 million for the week ended June 20, according to a report
e-mailed today by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data
provider. Total net investment into developing-nation  equity 
funds has totaled $15.27 billion in 2012, compared with outflows
of $12.8 billion for the same period of 2011.  Asian funds excluding Japan recorded their biggest weekly
outflow in 2012, posting redemptions of $1.03 billion,  Cameron Brandt , EPFR director of research, said by e-mail today.  China equity funds have recorded eight consecutive weeks of
outflows while Russia-dedicated funds posted a net outflow for
the week of $61 million as  oil prices  tumbled.  Latin America-dedicated funds recorded a net inflow of $180
million as  Brazil  sought ways to boost economic growth.  The average emerging-market equity portfolio posted a 2.6
percent gain for the week to extend the 2012 advance to 5.03
percent, Brandt said.  Emerging-market bond funds registered inflows of $552
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
