(Corrects amount of ING note in second paragraph.)  Bank of America Merrill Lynch sold
$100 million of structured notes that will initially reward
investors based on the performance of a similar note issued last
year by ING Groep NV.  The $100 million credit-linked note is tied to a 6.51
billion-ruble ($194 million) ING security, which itself is
linked to a bond from OAO Gazprombank, Russia’s third-biggest
lender, until December 12. After that Bank of America’s note is
tied to a basket of undisclosed credits.  Andrew Todd , a Bank of America spokesman in London,
declined to comment on the note.  Credit-linked notes are securities with derivatives tied to
the risk of a company or country’s debt and offer higher yields
and tailored maturities that may not be available in the  bond
market . Investors typically suffer losses if there’s a default
for either the bank issuing the note or the reference entity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
