Paladin Energy Ltd. (PDN) , the Australian
company producing uranium in  Africa , expects to announce as many
as three deals within three or four months to sell minority
stakes in some of its projects under development.  “There’s high interest in uranium assets,” John Borshoff,
chief executive officer of Perth-based Paladin, said today in a
telephone interview, declining to be more specific. “Some deals
we might be able to consummate quite soon.”  Paladin, which operates uranium mines in Namibia and Malawi,
is also developing assets in Australia, Canada and Niger. The
company forecasts that uranium prices will climb this year amid
a looming supply deficit after the Fukushima disaster in  Japan 
triggered a 17 percent slump in 2011.  Paladin expected to complete a process to sell a minority
stake in one of its uranium projects in  Western Australia  or the
Northern Territory in the first quarter to help fund development,
Borshoff said in a Jan. 30 interview.  In addition to seeking joint-venture partners, the company
is “carefully considering all its options now available to
secure optimal value,” Paladin said April 10. Paladin has
attracted strong interest from “various potential strategic
partners,” it said April 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
