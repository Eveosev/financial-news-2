Brent crude  rose in London, paring a
second weekly decline, on speculation that its plunge to an 18-
month low below $90 a barrel was excessive.  Brent’s 14-day relative strength index, a measure of how
quickly prices have risen or dropped, was at 17.4 today. A
reading of 30 or less can suggest prices have tumbled too
quickly. Brent earlier declined to its lowest since December
2010 after  German business confidence  fell to the weakest level
in more than two years in June, and the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s economic index yesterday signaled the biggest
contraction in manufacturing in almost a year.  “It’s time for a rebound,” said  Hannes Loacker , an
analyst at  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  in Vienna. “Below
$90 per barrel, the marginal cost projects are not economically
viable any more. So some  oil companies  will have to cut capital
expenditure if prices fall further.”  Brent oil for August settlement rose 71 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $89.94 a barrel at 1:34 p.m. on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, after sliding 74 cents to $88.49, the
lowest since Dec. 2, 2010. The contract has fallen 7.9 percent
this week. The European benchmark’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate in  New York  was at $11.63 after closing at $11.03
yesterday, the narrowest gap since January.  WTI for August delivery advanced 11 cents, or 0.1 percent,
to $78.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It earlier fell as much as 64 cents to
$77.56 a barrel, the lowest since Oct. 5, and has lost 6.8
percent this week.  Brent in Contango  The August Brent contract traded at a 33-cent discount to
September. It’s the fifth consecutive day that the front-month
contract has been cheaper than the second month, a market
structure known as contango, which typically signals an excess
of supply relative to demand in the short-term.  Prices may fall in New York next week on signals that
global economic growth is slowing, a Bloomberg survey showed.
Fourteen of 27 analysts, or 52 percent, forecast crude will
decline through June 29. Nine respondents, or 33 percent,
predicted that futures will be little changed and four said
there will be an increase.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said today its German
business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives,
dropped for a second straight month to 105.3 from 106.9 in May.
That’s the lowest reading since March 2010. Economists predicted
a decline to 105.6, according to the median of 39 estimates in a
Bloomberg News  survey .  Global Manufacturing Declines  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s factory index
dropped to minus 16.6 in June, the lowest reading since August.
A gauge of euro-region manufacturing fell to 44.8, the weakest
in three years, London-based Markit Economics said yesterday in
an initial estimate. The preliminary reading for a Chinese
purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit was
48.1, signaling an eighth month of contraction.  A storm cluster just north of the Yucatan Peninsula is
becoming better defined and may move into the central  Gulf of
Mexico  as Tropical Storm Chris weakens off Newfoundland, the
National Hurricane Center said.  A swath of rain and storms across the Caribbean from  Mexico 
to Cuba and  Florida  has a 70 percent chance of forming into a
tropical cyclone within 48 hours, the Miami-based center said in
a 5 a.m. Atlantic time advisory. Floods and heavy rain may occur
from southern Florida to the Yucatan through tomorrow.  Oil in New York has technical support along its lower
Bollinger Band on the 30-day chart, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Futures yesterday halted their decline near the indicator,
which is at about $77.37 a barrel today. Buy orders tend to be
clustered near chart-support levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
