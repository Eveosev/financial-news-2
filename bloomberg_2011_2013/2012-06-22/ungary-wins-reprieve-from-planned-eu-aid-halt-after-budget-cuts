The European Union scrapped a
planned suspension of  Hungary ’s development aid after the
government presented plans to replace one-off levies with
permanent taxes to sustainably cut the  budget deficit .  EU finance ministers, meeting in Luxembourg today, lifted
the suspension of 495 million euros ($627 million) in Hungary’s
2013 cohesion funds. Hungary, the most indebted of the EU’s
eastern members, escaped becoming the first country to have the
aid tap turned off since the fund was set up in 1994.  Hungary, which wants to start talks on an  International
Monetary Fund -led loan next month, plans banking and telephone-
call taxes to cut the  budget deficit  to 2.2 percent of gross
domestic product in 2013 from a targeted 2.5 percent this year.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , since his election in 2010,
has relied on the nationalization of private pension fund
savings and extraordinary taxes on the financial, energy, retail
and telecommunication industries to plug budget holes.  The government forecasts 283 billion forint ($1.3 billion)
in revenue from the bank transaction tax in 2013, on top of a 60
billion forint special levy on the financial industry which the
Cabinet plans to scrap in 2014. Banks have rejected paying the
two taxes simultaneously and have threatened to shift
transactions abroad and renege on commitments made last year to
boost lending and aid foreign-currency borrowers.  The economy shrank 0.7 percent from a year earlier in the
first quarter, the first contraction in more than three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
