Historian Bernard Lewis was
surprised by Colonel Muammar Qaddafi’s 2006 invitation to visit
 Libya . After a flight from Tripoli into the desert, Lewis was
taken into a big tent where the head of state waited for him.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Geometric patterns in white, green and gold decorated the
walls, while bare bulbs illuminated the dim interior. On the
table were long branches to be used as fly chasers. Qaddafi was
clad in a black, long-sleeved tee shirt and a brown blanket,
which he wore over one shoulder.  Speaking through a translator, Qaddafi noted that more than
a million Arabs live among the Jews in Israel. He said that
proves the two groups can peacefully co-exist.  Why not create a single state for both Jews and
Palestinians?  Qaddafi even had a name for it: “Isratine.”  I spoke with Lewis, author of “Notes on a Century:
Reflections of a  Middle East  Historian,” on the following
topics:  1. Clash of Civilizations  2. Western Influence  3. History as Propaganda  4. Misleading Documents  5. Islamic Rage  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
