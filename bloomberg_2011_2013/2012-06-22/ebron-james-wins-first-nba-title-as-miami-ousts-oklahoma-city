LeBron James  won his first National
Basketball Association championship, scoring 26 points as the
Miami Heat won the title with a 121-106 victory tonight against
the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder.  Mike Miller added 23 points, including seven 3-pointers, as
Miami won the best-of-seven NBA Finals four games to one. The
