Old Mutual Plc (OML)  declined the most in
three weeks after 15 global banks were downgraded by Moody’s
Investor Services, ending a six-day rally that took the stock to
levels some analyst consider overbought.  Shares in the U.K.’s third-largest life insurer fell 1.4
percent, the most since June 1, to 20.41 rand at the close in
Johannesburg. The stock climbed 6.9 percent between June 14 and
yesterday, taking its 14-day  relative strength index  to 71.3,
the highest since Feb. 20.  Shares in banks and insurers weakened in  Europe  after
Moody’s cut credit ratings for Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan
Stanley and 13 other banks. The lenders have “significant
exposure to the volatility and risk of outsized losses inherent
to capital-markets activities,” Moody’s Global Banking Managing
Director Greg Bauer said in a statement.  “The movements over the last week have been driven by
global sentiment,” Harry Botha, an analyst at Avior Research
Ltd. who has an outperform, the equivalent of buy,
recommendation on the stock, said by phone from Johannesburg.
“I think fundamentally it stays cheap.”  The RSI shows how rapidly prices advanced or dropped
during a specified time period. A reading of 70 or above signals
to some investors that shares are set to fall.  To contact the reporters on this story:
