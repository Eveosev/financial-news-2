United Grain Co., the state grain
trader, sees its grain exports rising to as much as 1.5 million
metric tons in the season that ends on June 30.  The season starting on July 1 may not be as favorable as
2011 in terms of weather conditions and high grain price
volatility may also limit shipments, Irina Skrynnik, the
company’s spokeswoman, said by phone from  St. Petersburg .
Shipments last season were hampered after Russia had the worst
drought in at least 50 years in 2010, which prompted the
government to stop grain exports from Aug. 15, 2010 through June
2011.  Russia’s grain harvest reached 94 million tons last year,
including 56 million tons of wheat, according to the state
statistics service. The country’s grain exports were at record
levels this year, reaching about 26 million tons by June 7,
according to agriculture ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
