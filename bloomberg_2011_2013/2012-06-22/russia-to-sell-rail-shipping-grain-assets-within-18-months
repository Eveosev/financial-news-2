Russia’s government plans to sell
stakes in its rail monopoly, grain trader, biggest shipper,
nanotechnology holding and largest banks within 18 months as it
loosens its grip on an economy dominated by commodity exports.  Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  ordered officials to sell
all of United Grain Co., half of OAO Sovcomflot and a quarter of
0A0 Russian Railways either this year or next year, according to
a  decree  posted on the government’s website.  The state must also sell half of Rosagroleasing, 25.5
percent of OAO Bank VTB, 10 percent of nanotechnology holding
OAO Rusnano and 7.6 percent of OAO Sberbank in the same period.  President  Vladimir Putin  and Medvedev, his predecessor, are
reviving government efforts to lure investment and wean the
economy off oil and gas, which account for about half of budget
revenues, by selling what they deem non-strategic assets.  Putin pledged yesterday at the St. Petersburg International
Economic Forum to push through asset sales while avoiding the
mistakes of the 1990s, when  Boris Yeltsin ’s government sold some
of the country’s biggest assets at a fraction of their market
value, creating a class of politically connected billionaires
overnight.  By 2016, the government must sell all of its shares in
hydropower producer OAO RusHydro, Russian Agricultural Bank or
OAO Rosselkhozbank, airline OAO Aeroflot, oil producer
Zarubezhneft, electricity producer and distributor Inter RAO
UES, Sheremetyevo Airport and diamond monopoly OAO Alrosa,
according to the decree.  “The specific dates and methods of privatization of these
companies will be determined by the government of the Russian
Federation, taking into account market conditions and the
recommendations of leading investment consultants,” Medvedev
said in the decree.  To contact the reporter on this story:
