Captain Philipp Lahm scored to give
 Germany  a 1-0 lead against Greece at halftime of their
quarterfinal in soccer’s European Championship.  The defender cut in from the wing and scored past an
outstretched Greek goalkeeper Michalis Sifakis in the 39th
minute of the match in Gdansk,  Poland .  Germany had 70 percent of possession in the period, and had
several chances to score before Lahm’s goal. The Greeks tried to
frustrate their opponents by keeping 9 or 10 players in their
half to defend.  Germany made it to tonight’s quarterfinal as the sole team
to win all three matches in the tournament’s opening group
round. Greece advanced by beating Russia 1-0 on the final day of
the opening stage.  The teams have met eight times, with the 2004 European
champion  Greece  never beating Germany, which has won 5 of the
matches and tied the others, according to statistics from FIFA,
the sport’s governing body.  Last night, Portugal defeated the Czech Republic 1-0 to
become the first team to reach the semifinals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
