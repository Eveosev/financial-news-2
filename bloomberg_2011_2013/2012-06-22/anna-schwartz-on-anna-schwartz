Anna Schwartz, who  died yesterday  at 96, worked at the National Bureau of Economic Research for more than 70 years, beginning in 1941. In 2001, when she was 86, I conducted a two-and-a-half hour interview with her  about her work at the NBER. The  interview  begins with her undergraduate years at Barnard College and includes her work in the government during the New Deal, graduate study at Columbia University, and her personal life. Much of the interview concerns her academic relationship with  Milton Friedman  and their years producing the monumental volume "A Monetary History of the United States." (Claudia Goldin, a professor of economics at  Harvard University , is the author of "Understanding the Gender Gap: An Economic History of American Women." She is director of the NBER’s Development of the American Economy program.)
