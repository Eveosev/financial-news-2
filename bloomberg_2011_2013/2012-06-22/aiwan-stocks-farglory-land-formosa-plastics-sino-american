NT$281.50, the most since May 23. The computer maker cut prices
of some of its new Zenbook notebook computers to compete with
Apple Inc. in  North America ,  Apple Daily  reported.  The company will cut prices for its older generation
notebooks, while keeping the retail price of the new models,
 David Chang , the company’s Chief Financial Officer, said in a

Fibre Corp. (1326)  (1326 TT) declined 3.1 percent to NT$77.10, the most

Chemicals by NT$100 million each, according to the statement.  Radiant Opto-Electronics Corp. (6176)  (6176 TT), a liquid-crystal
display maker, jumped 3.7 percent to a record high of NT$156.
The company’s share-price estimate was raised 16 percent to
