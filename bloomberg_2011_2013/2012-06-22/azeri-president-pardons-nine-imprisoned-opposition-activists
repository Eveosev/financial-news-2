Azeri President Ilham Aliyev today
pardoned nine opposition activists imprisoned for attending
anti-government protests last year that were inspired by Arab
Spring revolutions.  The pardon decree, published on the presidential  website ,
came weeks after U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  visited
the Azeri capital of Baku and called for the release of all
imprisoned opposition members.  Baxtiyar Haciyev, a Harvard-educated youth activist who was
also jailed last year after using Facebook to call for anti-
government protests, was released two days before Clinton’s
visit on June 6.  Opposition parties and groups in energy-rich  Azerbaijan 
staged rallies in Baku in March and April 2011 in an effort to
replicate popular uprisings that drove out authoritarian leaders
in Tunisia and  Egypt . While the rallies didn’t threaten
President Aliyev, police detained hundreds of protesters. About
16 of them were later imprisoned for disrupting public order and
damaging private property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
