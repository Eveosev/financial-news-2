Greater harmonization of Europe’s
banking system under common oversight is an essential first step
to strengthening financial stability in the euro region, Italian
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said in an interview with
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung.   He added that failure to reach an accord at the Brussels
summit next week will mean continued high  interest rates  for a
large part of Europe with damaging consequences for companies,
the newspaper reported in a preview of an article to appear
today. A failure to reach an agreement likely will turn public
opinion against greater integration, he also told the newspaper.  The European Union’s deficit as a whole amounts to 3.6
percent of gross domestic product, including 3.2 percent in the
euro zone, 4.4 percent in the Netherlands, 4.5 percent in
 France , and 0.9 percent in Germany, while Italy will have a
structural surplus of 0.6 percent in 2013, he also said,
according to SZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
