Kazakhstan must provide conditions
for its lenders to compete with the local units of foreign banks
that receive support from their parent institutions and the
state, Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  said.  “Foreign banks have competitive advantages that must be
taken into account” by the Kazakh government and the central
bank, Nazarbayev was  quoted  as telling businessmen in Astana by
the state-owned Kazinform news service.  Sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, the primary conduit
for the banking industry’s bailout program, took control of BTA
Bank in 2009 and bought shares in Kazkommertsbank and  Halyk
Savings Bank (HSBK) , which is controlled by Nazarbayev’s daughter and
son-in-law. Russian state-run OAO Sberbank’s unit became
Kazakhstan’s sixth largest lender by assets as of May 1 from
eighth largest a year earlier, according to the Kazakh central
bank’s financial oversight committee website.  Foreign banks shouldn’t control over 30 percent of the
financial services in  Kazakhstan , Nazarbayev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
