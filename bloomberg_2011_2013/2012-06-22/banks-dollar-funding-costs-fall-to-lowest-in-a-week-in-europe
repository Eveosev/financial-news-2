The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell to the lowest in a week, according to a
money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 51 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 12:30 p.m. in
London, from minus 54 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The measure is the cheapest level since June 15.  The one-year basis swap was at 51 basis points below
Euribor from minus 51.5 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. Euribor is the rate  banks  say they see each
other lending in euros derived from a survey of panel banks. It
is published about 9 a.m. daily by the European Banking
Federation in Brussels.  Three-month Euribor fell to 0.654 percent from 0.655 the
day before. The rate has fallen since June 14 toward the record
low of 0.634 percent reached on March 31, 2010. One-week Euribor
fell to 0.323 percent from 0.325 percent.  The Eonia-OIS swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, was little changed
at 22 basis points. The overnight indexed swap held below the
 European Central Bank ’s  deposit rate  of 25 basis points for the
fifth day.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to Eonia-OIS -- known as the  FRA/OIS spread  -- were at
28 basis points from 28.5 yesterday.  The Euribor/OIS spread was 43.5 at basis points from 43
yesterday.  ECB Deposits  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based ECB
yesterday, placing 770 billion euros ($965 billion) from 780
billion euros the day before.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans fell to 0.462 percent from 0.468 percent. The
measure held at 0.468 for 13 days. Libor, which acts as a
benchmark for about $360 trillion of financial instruments
worldwide, is published by the British Bankers’ Association.  Three-month Euribor USD, a gauge of dollar funding costs
from the Brussels-based EBF, rose to 0.949 percent from 0.948
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
