The U.S. will provide $20 million in
grants for clean-energy projects in  Africa , an industry that
will create new jobs in the region, Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said.  The continent has abundant sunlight as well as geothermal
and hydropower reserves that can be used to produce electricity,
Clinton said today during a press briefing at the  UN Conference
on Sustainable Development  in Rio de Janeiro.  Building and operating renewable-power plants will create
jobs and benefit Africa, she said. The funds add to $2 billion
the U.S. set aside last year to support clean-energy projects in
 developing countries .  “Investors in this space often see obstacles and risks
that stop them investing in clean energy in Africa,” Clinton.
“Clean energy will create new jobs and new livelihoods.’  To contact the reporters on this story:
