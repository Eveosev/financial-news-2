Hitachi Ltd., which posted a record
profit last fiscal year, appointed its first non-Japanese
outside directors, who pledged to help the company cut costs and
boost profitability.  “It’s important to set the organization stretch targets,”
 George Buckley , one of the new directors and a former chief
executive officer of 3M Co., told reporters in Tokyo today.
“There are wonderful profits to be made in the parts and
service business.”  The maker of nuclear reactors, train cars and air-
conditioners plans to cut costs by 5 percent within five years
and widen its  profit margin  as it competes with Siemens AG and
 General Electric Co. (GE)  The Tokyo-based company has predicted a 16
percent increase in operating profit this year, helped by a
rebound in its power systems business.  “Hitachi needs to find low-cost suppliers and not do
everything in-house,” Philip Yeo, the second non-Japanese
outside director, said. “If you don’t grow globally you’re
going to have a problem due to costs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
