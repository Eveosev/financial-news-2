China Investment Corp., the world’s
fifth-largest sovereign fund, agreed to buy a 7 percent stake in
satellite company Eutelsat Communications SA from Spain’s
 Abertis Infraestructuras SA. (ABE)   China Investment will pay Barcelona-based Abertis 385.2
million euros ($483 million) for 15.4 million shares of Paris-
based Eutelsat, Abertis said in a statement today. Abertis
expects a net capital gain of 237 million euros.  “Abertis will likely dispose the remaining stake down the
road,” Bruno Silva and  Pedro Oliveira , analysts at Banco BPI,
wrote in a note sent to investors today.  Abertis, whose businesses range from toll-road management
to telecommunications services and airports, is selling assets
to cut debt and focus on projects where it can lead an
industrial partnership. Abertis, which sold a 16 percent stake
in Eutelsat for 981 million euros in January, still owns 8.35
percent of the French company.  Abertis shares climbed 0.4 percent to 10.09 euros at 9:57
a.m. in Madrid, valuing the company at 8.2 billion euros.
Eutelsat rose 2.8 percent to 23.94 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
