Hungary’s government doesn’t expect
the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union to set
stringent conditions during talks on financial aid,  Mihaly Varga , the country’s chief bailout negotiator, said.  “We think that a precautionary  credit line  wouldn’t make
strict conditions necessary,” Varga said in an interview on
public television channel  M1  late yesterday. “In the case of a
standby credit line, these could be more strict,” he said.  Hungary submitted amendments to a disputed central bank law
yesterday as the government seeks to restart talks on a
precautionary credit line. Negotiations will probably focus on
the financing of public transportation companies, local councils
and the tax system, Varga said.  “I trust that Parliament can approve the central bank law
amendments within two weeks, after which I see no substantial
obstacle to the start of negotiations,” Varga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
