Democratic Governor  Martin O’Malley 
of  Maryland  said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that
presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney sheds
“crocodile tears” as he decries the plight of factory workers
because as the former head of a private equity firm he helped
engineer the export of U.S. manufacturing jobs.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with Maryland Governor Martin
O’Malley, who’s also chairman of the Democratic Governors
Association. Governor, thank you for being with us.  GOVERNOR MARTIN O’MALLEY: Thank you, Al.  HUNT: You are one of the very top surrogates for President
Obama. In a paragraph, what’s the Obama vision for economic
recovery in a second term?  O’MALLEY: Well, it’s a vision of a country that’s still
expanding, still growing, creating jobs and expanding
opportunity, and a country that realizes that in order to do
that we have to not only balance our budget, but make critical
investments to educate, innovate and rebuild our country, just
as our parents and grandparents did.  HUNT: And that’s the real choice between the president and
Mitt Romney then?  O’MALLEY: I think it’s a very stark choice. If you look at
what Governor Romney is putting out as a supposed economic plan,
it’s really a return and a double down on what President Bush
tried that had such disastrous -  HUNT: Forty-three?  O’MALLEY: Correct. What  George W. Bush  that had such
disastrous economic consequences. Worst job losses, worst
deficits of any presidency since the Great Depression. So it’s a
very - it’s a very stark difference. Increasingly as this
campaign unfolds, that difference will become more and more
apparent to more and more people.  HUNT: Let me ask you this. We had a Bloomberg poll this
week that showed the president with a widening lead over -  O’MALLEY: I noticed that.  HUNT: - over - over Governor Romney. But it also said when
you look at the internals - which at this stage are more
important, as you know much better than I - voters give the
president bad grades on  job creation , bad grades on the  budget
deficit , bad grades on the economy, bad grades on  China . That’s
really not very encouraging, is it?  O’MALLEY: Well, no. But at the same time, in the course of
these campaigns we’re trying to do something more than simply
fill a certain job for a certain of time. In other words, it is
a conversation. It is a call and a response. And - and every
voter wants to - wants it known that they’re not happy with the
pace of our progress. And none of us really should be happy with
the pace of our progress.  And at the end of the day though, there will be a choice
made between two alternatives, two individuals. And I believe
that the president will prevail because his message is more
optimistic, it’s more forward looking, and it’s more truthful
and realistic.  HUNT: You have said that the president is open to anything
which accelerates this recovery. You talk to them all the time
in your surrogate role and head of the governors association for
Democrats. Would this include extending the Bush tax cuts for
the wealthy for a year?  O’MALLEY: Well, I think that the - I think that the
president’s been clear that he’s willing to compromise on the
Bush tax cuts, especially where lower earning people are
concerned.  HUNT: But how about for the wealthy?  O’MALLEY: I don’t know about that. To what good effect -
what good effect -  HUNT: If you’ve got to compromise for a year on the - for
the economy or whatever. I don’t know why, but I’m saying is
that -  O’MALLEY: In order for them not to take the dog hostage and
shoot it? For what end?  HUNT: So that compromise doesn’t appeal to you?  O’MALLEY: Well, I think that the - I think compromise for
the sake of the common good and our progress is an important
compromise to make. I don’t - looking at that hypothetically, I
think we’ve seen what the result is of massive tax cuts for the
wealthiest of Americans. There’s a myth. There’s a big lie
that’s really being told right now at this stage in the campaign
from the Romney camp and Republican surrogates. They want all of
us to believe that the reason we have a deficit is because of
great increases in federal spending.  And the truth will emerge that 55 percent of our federal
deficit is the direct result of tax cuts pushed through in the
Bush presidency that primarily benefited the wealthiest among
us. The jobs have not come raining down, Al.  HUNT: Let me turn to a couple of other subjects.
Immigration. The president’s immigration order of a week or so
ago, you have - you have lauded it. You said it’s good. It’s
certainly played out good politically. My question is if it was
such a good idea, why did the president wait until four and a
half months before the election? Why not do it six months ago?  O’MALLEY: I don’t know. There’s a certain - there’s a
certain pace to every issue. And they - I think a greater amount
of support has built around the issue of immigration reform,
especially over these last couple of very frustrating thing. And
I think the other thing that has -  HUNT: You don’t think he did it for political reasons right
now rather than doing it six months earlier?  O’MALLEY: So much of what - timing is such a - is such an
interesting art. And one of the things that we rely upon leaders
to do is to instinctively kind of know when the time is right
for change that can actually take hold and become lasting.
Ironically, I think one of the things that has built a greater
consensus for immigration reform in our country is the very
mean-spirited and unkind language that emerged out of the
Republican presidential primaries. It’s not in keeping with the
generous nation that our parents and grandparents -  HUNT: Another subject. The Washington Post reported Friday
that under  Mitt Romney ,  Bain Capital  invested in companies that
sent American jobs overseas. The Romney campaign said the story
is fundamentally flawed because it didn’t differentiate between
domestic outsourcing versus offshoring, and that that - that was
the - they were insistent of that. Every example of outsourcing
involved sending jobs. Flawed story, bum rap?  O’MALLEY: No, I think it’s a legitimate story. Mitt Romney
stands up in front of factory gates and cries crocodile tears
and falsely claims that the president is sending jobs to other
countries, and yet he made a big profit telling Americans
companies just how they could move jobs to other countries. I
don’t quite get his nuance between whatever the words that he
used. I suppose if you shake the Etch-A-Sketch enough you can
come up with a - with a story that works for the day.  But long term, I think the deeper - the deeper
disqualification of this, beyond his lack of sincerity and the
crocodile tears for factory jobs lost, is that he has no record
as a job creator. Now you can quibble with the fact that the
rate of job creation should be even greater by now in this
recession, but you cannot debate the fact that we have had 27
months in a row of private sector, month-to-month positive job
growth. Nor can you debate that under  Governor Romney  in
Massachusetts their state ranked 47th in job growth. So the
bigger point of the story I believe is that his work at Bain was
about wealth consolidation, not about job creation in the  United
States .  HUNT: Give me a couple quick political questions. Should
Hilary Clinton run for president in 2016? Would it be good for
the  Democratic Party ?  O’MALLEY: Oh, I don’t know. She’s certainly done an
outstanding job, I believe, as President Obama’s secretary of
state.  HUNT: She’d be a strong candidate?  O’MALLEY: I think she’d be tremendously strong.  HUNT: Would she run against Governor O’Malley if she ended
up running for president?  O’MALLEY: I don’t -  HUNT: You’re not going to tell us.  O’MALLEY: I don’t know about that, but I do know that she’s
a great leader. And if -  HUNT: It’s something that does cross your mind from time to
time.  O’MALLEY: What’s that?  Hillary Clinton  running for
president?  HUNT: No, the idea of Martin O’Malley running.  O’MALLEY: Only when reporters ask me, and my mom.  HUNT: You mentioned earlier you thought that - is your mom
for it, by the way?  O’MALLEY: I’ve asked her not to make comments.  HUNT: Finally, you said Obama was going to win. How big a
victory do you expect in November?  O’MALLEY: I don’t know. I think what we’ll see is a very
lively debate about these two different visions for - for
creating jobs and expanding opportunity. And at the end of it
though, I think the race could well widen and he may well win by
a larger margin than any of the pundits in town are predicting.  HUNT: Governor Martin O’Malley, thank you so much for being
with us.  O’MALLEY: Thank you, Al.  HUNT: Say hi to your mom. I’ll try to get her views on your
candidacy later.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY
