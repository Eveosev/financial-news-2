Vale SA (VALE) , the world’s biggest iron-
ore producer, will invest 650 million reais ($315 million) in
two wind farms that Pacific Hydro Pty. will develop in Brazil to
meet its growing energy needs.  Vale and Melbourne-based Pacific Hydro will each own 50
percent of the projects in the northeastern state of  Rio Grande 
do Norte, the Rio de Janeiro-based mining company said today in
a statement. They will have combined capacity of 140 megawatts.  Vale, which will consume all of the plants’ energy for 20
years, is seeking to produce more of the power it needs to
expand its mining operations, according to the statement.  “Vale’s global electricity demand is expected to grow 150
percent by 2020,” Vania Somavilla, the company’s director of
human resources, health and safety, sustainability and energy,
said in the statement. “We’re looking for alternatives to meet
this necessity in a sustainable manner.”  The projects are expected to start producing power in 2014
and will be Vale’s first wind farms, according to the statement.  Pacific Hydro has developed two Brazilian wind farms with
58 megawatts of capacity in the northeastern city of Paraiba
that sell power to  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) , according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
