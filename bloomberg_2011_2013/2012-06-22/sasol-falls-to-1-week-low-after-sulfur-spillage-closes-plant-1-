Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  declined to the lowest in
more than a week after the company said it cleared its Sasolburg
plant yesterday after spilled sulfur set off alarms.  Shares in the largest producer of motor fuels made from
coal slipped as much as 2.1 percent to 355 rand, the lowest
level since June 13, and traded at 357.76 by 11:10 a.m. in
Johannesburg.  A small amount of the sulphur additive that is mixed with
gases at the plant was spilled, said Jacqui O’Sullivan, a Sasol
spokeswoman. She said there were no gas leaks.  “We closed roads in the area and moved personnel to
gathering points, as per our emergency protocols, but the
operations continued at the plant and production was in no way
affected,” O’Sullivan said in a separate e-mailed comment to
Bloomberg.  The spillage may “have a small effect on Sasol’s shares,
but at the end of the day it won’t impact production,” Drikus Combrinck, a portfolio manager at PSG Konsult, said by
telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
