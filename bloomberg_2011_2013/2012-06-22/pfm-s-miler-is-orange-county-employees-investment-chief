Girard Miller, a public-pension and
finance consultant at PFM Group, has been named chief investment
officer of the $9.2 billion Orange County Employees Retirement
System, the California pension plan said in a  statement .  “His investment experience and thorough understanding of
public pension plans and retirement related issues will be of
tremendous value,” said Steve Delaney, chief executive officer
of the fund, known as OCERS.  Orange County suffered the biggest municipal bankruptcy in
U.S. history in 1994 after a wrong-way bet on interest rates.
Philadelphia-based PFM Group is the parent of Public Financial
Management, the largest  investment adviser  in the U.S. municipal
bond market.  Miller was previously president of Janus Mutual Funds and
chief operating officer of  Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) , the Denver-
based mutual-fund company. He was chief executive officer of the
ICMA Retirement Corp., a pension-plan administrator based in
Washington.  Public Financial Management was ranked first in proceeds
and number of deals among U.S. municipal advisers in 2011 by
 Thomson Reuters . The unit advised on 757 transactions involving
$39.6 billion last year, according to Thomson Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
