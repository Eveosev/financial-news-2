Ghana ’s cedi retreated for a third
straight week to the lowest on record as traders bought dollars
to bring in goods for resale and telecommunication companies
sought the U.S. currency to import equipment.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.3 percent in the day and the week to 1.9325 per
dollar as of 2:38 p.m. in Accra, the capital, the weakest level
since June 1993 when Bloomberg began compiling the data. The
cedi has declined 16 percent this year, the second-worst
performing African currency.  “Dollar demand was high this week, led by general
merchants,” Richard Buabeng, a currency trader at  CAL Bank
Ltd. (CAL) , an Accra-based lender, said by phone today. “Demand from
telecommunication companies was also very strong.”  Miners and international  oil companies  may sell dollars
next week, helping the currency to gain, Buabeng said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
