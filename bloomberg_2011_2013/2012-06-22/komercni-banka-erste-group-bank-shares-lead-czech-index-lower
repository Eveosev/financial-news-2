Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , a unit of  Societe
Generale  SA, and  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  of Austria led Czech shares
down after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded credit ratings
for 15 of the world’s biggest banks.  Komercni Banka dropped 1.7 percent to 3,440 koruna by 9:38
a.m. in Prague. Erste also slid 1.7 percent to 367.7 koruna. The
14-member  PX (PX)  equity index, where the two lenders have a combined
37 percent weighting, declined 0.8 percent.  Societe Generale’s long-term debt and deposit rating was
cut to A2 from A1 by Moody’s with a stable outlook. No lender
was cut more than Moody’s originally outlined in a review
started Feb. 15. Erste’s ratings were unaffected by the cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
