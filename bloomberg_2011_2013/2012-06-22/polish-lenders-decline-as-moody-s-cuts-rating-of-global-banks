Poland’s two biggest banks declined
after Moody’s Investors Service cut the credit ratings of 15
global banks.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO) , the country’s biggest lender controlled
by the government, lost 1 percent to 33.36 zloty and  Bank Pekao
SA (PEO) , the Polish unit of UniCredit SpA, retreated 0.7 percent to
142.9 zloty at 10:54 a.m. in Warsaw. The benchmark  WIG20 Index (WIG20) 
decreased 0.6 percent to 2,231.76. Western European lenders own
59 percent of Poland’s banking industry.  Moody’s downgraded 15 lenders yesterday, including JPMorgan
Chase & Co., citing their exposure to financial market
volatility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
