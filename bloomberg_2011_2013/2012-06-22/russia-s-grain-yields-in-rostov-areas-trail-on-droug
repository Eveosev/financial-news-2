Grain yields in the east of  Russia ’s
Rostov region, which produced the country’s third-biggest crop
last year, trailed the rest of the territory as drought damaged
plants, according to data from the local agriculture ministry.  Yields of winter crops that are being reaped now were 1 to
1.3 metric tons per hectare (2.47 acres) in eastern districts,
Mariam Ananyan, spokeswoman for the ministry, said today by e-
mail. In Rostov’s southern districts, which have suffered less
drought damage, yields were 3.2 to 3.4 tons, she said.  Rostov farmers reaped winter wheat from 35,200 hectares and
winter barley from 2,400 hectares to date, the ministry said in
a statement, after they started harvesting this month. Rostov
harvested 7.7 million tons of grains last year, or 8.2 percent
of the national crop, according to state statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
