The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
declined for a second day, dropping 1.2 percent to 34,118.87 by
the close in Johannesburg. The gauge has advanced 0.5 percent
this week, having reached a record on June 20.  The following were among the most active equities in the
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the diversified miner that
owns 77 percent of the world’s biggest platinum miner, slid 2.2
percent to 270.36 rand, a second day of losses, as the metal
declined.  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  , the producer of the metal
that has suspended operations at two mines in the past two
weeks, declined to the lowest on record in Johannesburg trading,
slumping 5 percent to 6.65 rand.  Old Mutual Plc (OML)  , the U.K.’s third-biggest life
insurer, fell the most in three weeks, dropping 1.4 percent to
20.41 rand. Shares in banks and insurers weakened in  Europe 
after Moody’s Investor Services cut credit ratings for Credit
Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley and 13 other banks.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the largest producer of motor fuels
made from coal, declined to the lowest close in more than a
month, sliding 2.7 percent to 353 rand. The company said it had
to clear its Sasolburg plant in  South Africa  yesterday because
of a sulphur spillage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
