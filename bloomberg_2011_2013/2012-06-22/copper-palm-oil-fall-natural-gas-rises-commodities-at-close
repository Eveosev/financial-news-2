since Oct. 4. Prices are down 7.3 percent this week and 21

materials slumped 22 percent from this year’s closing high,
entering a  bear market .  August-delivery bullion was little changed at $1,563.50 an

Markets in China are closed for a holiday.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil  declined for a second day, trimming the first
weekly gain in four, on speculation that rains in the Midwest
will boost U.S. soybean crops and a slowing global economy may
curb demand for raw materials.  September-delivery palm oil retreated as much as 2.3
percent to 2,932 ringgit ($919) a metric ton on the Malaysia

are both used in foods and fuels.  Corn headed for the best week in more than a month as dry

yields in the world’s largest grower.  December-delivery corn rose as much as 0.6 percent to
$5.5325 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The most-active
contract was unchanged at $5.50 at 3:23 p.m. in Singapore, set
