Italian  household confidence  fell
this month to a record low as joblessness rose and Prime
Minister  Mario Monti ’s fiscal measures deepened the country’s
fourth economic recession since 2001.  The confidence index fell to 85.3, the lowest since the
data series began in 1996, from 86.5 in May, national statistics
office  Istat  said in  Rome  today. Economists forecast a reading
of 86, according to the median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Italy’s new property tax, known as IMU, made its debut this
month with the first of three payments due on June 18. The IMU,
which marked the return of taxation on primary residences after
four years, was part of the 20 billion-euro ($25.1 billion)
package that the government passed to cut the country’s deficit.
That plan and other measures that have pushed gasoline prices to
record levels helped push the economy deeper into the recession.
Italy’s joblessness rose in April to a seasonally adjusted 10.1
percent, the highest in 12 years.  Monti’s government is trying to avoid a planned increase of
the value-added tax that may weigh further on consumers,
Economic Development Minister  Corrado Passera  said yesterday in
an interview.  “The economy shows signs of strong deterioration,”
Finance Undersecretary Gianfranco Polillo told the Senate in
Rome on June 6. “In light of the fall in domestic demand,
betting on a further VAT increase would be incomprehensible and
even wrong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
