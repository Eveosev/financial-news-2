U.K. stocks  dropped for a second
day, led by a selloff in mining and energy companies, as base
metals declined amid signs of a global economic slowdown.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  retreated more than
2 percent in London, sending a gauge of metal producers to its
lowest level in three weeks.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and  BG Group Plc (BG/) 
decreased as crude oil traded near its lowest price in more than
eight months.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  fell 1 percent to 5,513.69 at the close
in London, trimming the gauge’s third week of gains to 0.6
percent. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also lost 1 percent
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped 0.7 percent.  “Regional markets are stuck in a rut amid ongoing fears
over slowing global growth,” said Ishaq Siddiqi, a market
strategist at ETX Capital in  London . “This week’s batch of
rather gloomy macro releases have reignited these worries,
pushing investors to book profits.”  The FTSE 100 yesterday dropped by the most in almost three
weeks after  manufacturing reports  in  Europe  and  China  added to
concern that global growth is weakening. The gauge has  fallen
7.6 percent from its 2012 high  on March 16.  A report today showed that  business confidence  in  Germany ,
Europe’s largest economy, fell to the lowest level in more than
two years in June as the worsening sovereign-debt crisis clouded
the economic outlook. The Ifo Institute said its business-
climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, dropped to
105.3 from 106.9.  Mining Companies  A gauge of  U.K. mining companies  retreated 2 percent as
copper declined for a third day on the London Metal Exchange.
Lead, tin and zinc also fell.  Kazakhmys lost 3 percent to 702 pence, Vedanta Resources
retreated 2.9 percent to 903.5 pence and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  decreased
2.7 percent to 816.5 pence.  India ’s Business Standard reported that the government will
reject Vedanta’s offer to buy stakes in Hindustan Zinc Ltd. and
Bharat Aluminium Co. The newspaper cited a government official
it didn’t identify.  Energy companies also retreated as crude oil traded near
its lowest price since Oct. 4. Futures slumped 4 percent
yesterday after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
 economic index  signaled the biggest contraction in manufacturing
in almost a year.  Tullow Oil  Tullow Oil declined 3.4 percent to 1,431 pence, BG Group
slid 2.4 percent to 1,217.5 pence and  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Europe’s second-
biggest oil producer , fell 1.2 percent to 407.25 pence.  Michael Page International Plc (MPI)  sank 4.3 percent to 365.8
pence after Credit Suisse downgraded the U.K. recruitment
company’s shares to underperform, the equivalent of a sell
rating, from neutral.  Analysts named  Michael Page  the “most vulnerable” of the
recruitment companies. They warned of a “sharp decline” in
earnings for the company in 2012.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  fell 3.1 percent to 326.8 pence
as Exane BNP Paribas initiated coverage of the retailer’s shares
with an underperform recommendation.  In Ireland,  Aer Lingus (AERL)  Group Plc added 1.7 percent to 1.07
euros.  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ’s Chief Executive Officer,  Michael O’Leary , and his advisers were due to meet with European
Commission officials this morning, said two people familiar with
the matter. The CEO wants to address any regulatory hurdles
before the company files documents on the 1.30 euros-a-share,
694-million euro ($870 million) offer in the next few weeks,
they said.  Ryanair shares gained 1.5 percent to 4.08 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
