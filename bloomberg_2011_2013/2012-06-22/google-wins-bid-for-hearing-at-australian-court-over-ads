Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
most-popular search engine, won a bid to appeal an Australian
ruling that it misled consumers in 2007 by including paid
advertisements from competitors in search results for
businesses.  The  High Court  of Australia in Sydney today granted
Google’s request for a hearing.  An April 3 decision made Google responsible for ads that
are displayed and said the company isn’t merely a conduit for
the advertiser. The Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission had  sued  Google in what it said was the first claim
of its kind in the world that makes the search-engine company
responsible for the content of ads.  The appeal case is Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission v. Google Inc. NSD1759/2011. Federal Court of
 Australia  (Sydney).  To contact the reporter on this story:
