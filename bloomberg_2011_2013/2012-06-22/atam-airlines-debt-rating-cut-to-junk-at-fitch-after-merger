Latam Airlines Group SA’s  credit
rating  was lowered to junk by  Fitch Ratings  after it was formed
today from the takeover of Tam SA by Lan Airlines SA.  Lan changed its name to Latam today, according to a
statement sent to the Santiago stock exchange. Fitch cut Latam’s
rating two steps to BB+, or one level below investment grade.
Tam’s credit ranking was raised two levels to BB from B+. Yields
on Tam’s benchmark 8.375 percent dollar bonds due 2021 slipped
two basis points today to 8.04 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Lan has no outstanding bonds.  Lan, based in Santiago, had sought to retain the highest
credit rating among global air carriers after its acquisition of
Tam to hold down borrowing costs amid a seven-year, $8.9 billion
fleet expansion. The takeover created the world’s biggest
airline by market value.  “Incorporated in the ratings is Latam’s track record of
maintaining a relatively stable credit profile through the
economic cycle during the last several years as well as the
deterioration in its credit metrics during the 24 months period
ended in March 2012,” Fitch analysts led by Jose Vertiz said in
a report released today. “This has been driven primarily by the
implementation of its strategic fleet plan.”
 Lan and Tam will continue to operate flights under their own
brands.  To contact the reporters on this story:
