The euro strengthened against the
dollar after the  European Central Bank  eased terms for
collateral, boosting speculation the central bank will announce
a third set of long-term loans.  The 17-nation currency gains were limited amid reports
investors to take losses in a Spanish debt restructuring and
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said direct bailout funding to
banks violates the region’s treaties. The yen weakened as
Japanese lawmakers in the lower house prepared to vote on a bill
to double  sales tax . Risk-sensitive currencies such as New
Zealand’s dollar and Mexico’s peso rallied as stocks and
commodities rebounded.  “The move by the ECB can help ease some of the funding
issues for Spain,” said  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in
 Washington  at Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of
 Western Union Co. (WU)  “The euro is finding a little bit of footing
with markets really turning to next week’s EU summit.”  The euro gained 0.2 percent to $1.2570 at 5 p.m. New York
time, after adding as much as 0.4 percent. The U.S. currency was
0.2 percent higher against the yen at 80.43, after appreciating
to 80.57, the strongest level since May 2. The yen lost 0.4
percent to 101.10 per euro.  Market Forces  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.7 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials increased 0.8
percent. Crude oil futures rallied 2.5 percent.  Futures traders decreased their bets that the euro will
decline against the  U.S. dollar , figures from the Washington-
based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 141,066 contracts
on June 19, compared with net shorts of 195,187 a week earlier.
They reached a record of 214,418 the week ended June 5.  Canada’s dollar added 0.5 percent to C$1.0246 after
touching C$1.0300, its lowest in a week as a rally in crude oil
outweighed a report showing inflation advanced at the slowest
pace in two years.  New Zealand’s dollar was the best performer against the
dollar, gaining 0.5 percent to 79.06 U.S. cents. Mexico’s peso,
added 0.4 percent to 13.8624.  Financial Strength  “Financials are rebounding quite strongly, so the market
may be set for a reprieve,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , chief
economic strategist at  Miller Tabak  in New York. “It’s quite
clear that fiscal and banking unions are needed in Europe but
what’s needed right now is a timeline.”  The euro retreated as Merkel, speaking to reporters in  Rome 
today at crisis talks before a June 28-29 summit, said Spain is
responsible for its own banks and that direct bailout funding of
banks violates treaties.  Spanish policy makers considered forcing investors who hold
equity and junior debt in banks to absorb losses in a
restructuring, according to a person with knowledge of the plan.  “The market sees this as a signal that there is another
longer-term refinancing operation coming,” said Steven Englander, head of Group of 10 currency strategy at Citigroup
Inc. in  New York . “They are targeting the same banks as they
did in the first instance, in a sense the LTROs were limited
only by the collateral that peripheral banks could bring to the
ECB to get the money.”  Euro Range  The shared currency is down from this year’s high of
$1.3487 on Feb. 24 and has depreciated about 6.6 percent in the
past 12 months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes that measure 10 developed-market currencies.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, fell 0.1 percent to 82.212 after touching
82.465, the strongest level since June 13.  The dollar climbed above 80 yen yesterday for the first
time in a month. Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s  Democratic
Party  struggled to overcome internal resistance to his bill to
double Japan’s consumption tax before a lower-house vote that
may come as soon as today.  The dollar’s rise versus the yen may stall, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The greenback faces so-called
resistance at the 100-day moving average of 80.41 yen, and may
find support at 79.84, the 50-day moving average, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
