Egypt ’s ruling military council
warned that it will act with “utmost determination and force”
to prevent chaos in the country amid rising protests against the
widening of army powers and suspension of parliament.  The council, in a statement on state television, said that
orders issued in the name of the people should be respected, and
the decree it issued that appropriates powers to the military at
the expense of the presidency was necessary.  The statement comes as Egypt awaits official results from
the presidential election to choose a successor to  Hosni Mubarak , ousted in a popular uprising last year. The two
candidates, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Mursi and former
premier Ahmed Shafik, have both claimed they are the winner.  The army council said it’s “not justified” to announce
results before they are officially declared. The results were
originally due yesterday, then postponed, and are now expected
within the next two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
