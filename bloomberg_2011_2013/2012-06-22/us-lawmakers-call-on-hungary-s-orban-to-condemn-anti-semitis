Fifty members of the  U.S. Congress 
called on Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  to stand up
against the anti-Semitic and homophobic remarks and the
positions of far-right political party Jobbik.  “We’re deeply concerned by anti-Semitic and homophobic
positions espoused by members of the Jobbik party,” the
lawmakers said in a letter addressed to Orban and posted on the
 website  of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Jobbik is  Hungary ’s second-largest opposition party after
winning 47 seats in Hungary’s 386-member Parliament in the 2010
general elections.  Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel returned a Hungarian
state award earlier this month after officials paid homage to a
writer who was a member of the Nazi-allied Arrow Cross regime
during World War II. Laszlo Kover, Hungary’s speaker of
parliament and other government officials attended a May 27
memorial ceremony to honor writer Jozsef Nyiro in the ethnic
Hungarian part of  Romania , where Wiesel was born.  Jobbik’s positions “must not be allowed to go
unchallenged, particularly in light of reports by the U.S
Department of State and the Anti-Defamation League that anti-
Semitic rhetoric is increasing in Hungary,” according to the
letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
