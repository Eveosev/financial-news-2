Taiwan’s jobless rate climbed for
the second straight month in May as a growth slowdown in  China 
and the  European debt crisis  hurt the export-dependent economy.  The  seasonally adjusted unemployment rate  rose to 4.25
percent from 4.19 percent in April, the statistics bureau said
in Taipei today. That compares with the 4.2 percent median
estimate of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Overseas sales make up about two-thirds of Taiwan’s economy,
and  export orders , an indication of shipments in the next one to
three months, fell for the fifth time in six months in May, a
report showed this week. The central bank kept  interest rates 
unchanged yesterday to bolster growth after  gross domestic
product  rose at the slowest pace since 2009 in the first quarter.  “We see a risk that unemployment may pick up in the next
few months as new graduates join the labor pool,”  Tony Phoo , a
Taipei-based economist at Standard Chartered Plc., said before
the data. “Local producers’ confidence may also be undermined
by the fallout from the European debt crisis.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
