(Correct speed in last paragraph.)  Tropical Storm Chris became a post-
tropical system today off the coast of Newfoundland and the
National Hurricane Center stopped issuing advisories on it.  Chris should merge with another low tomorrow, the center
said shortly before 11 a.m. East Coast time. The system was
moving west-southwest at 16 miles (26 kilometers) an hour with
winds of 45 mph, posing no threat to land.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
