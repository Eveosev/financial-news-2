President  Barack Obama  gave a speech today attacking  Mitt Romney  as an "outsourcing pioneer" and promoting his own plan to use corporate  tax policy  to favor companies that choose to locate operations in the  United States  instead of abroad.  He said : I am always struck by just how immoral this viewpoint is. International trade not only creates efficiencies and increases total global wealth. It is also gradually lifting the populations of China and  India  out of poverty. But Obama insists that, in order to protect the interests of a subset of U.S. workers and businesses, we should take steps that increase consumer prices for everyone else in U.S., and make it harder for the Chinese and Indian masses to rise into the middle class. I suspect Obama understands this, and his attacks on outsourcing are purely cynical. During the 2008 campaign, when he was promising to "renegotiate NAFTA," adviser  Austan Goolsbee   let slip to Canadian officials  that Obama was just blowing smoke, causing a gaffe. As president, Obama has made no moves to touch NAFTA, and he signed trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. Obama is most likely just grandstanding now, too. But it would be nice if he didn't feel the need to pretend that there was something wrong with giving a job to someone in a developing country -- and if voters didn't agree with that sentiment.
