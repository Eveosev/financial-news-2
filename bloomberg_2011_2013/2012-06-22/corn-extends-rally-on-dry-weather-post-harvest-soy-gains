Corn futures rose, capping the
largest weekly gain in 13 months, on speculation that dry, warm
weather next week will increase stress on crops in the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer and exporter. Soybeans also rose.  Dry weather will extend through the end of June for most of
the Midwest, where at least 50 percent of subsoil has been rated
below normal since May 31, Chicago-based  T-Storm Weather LLC 
said in a report. About 32 percent of the domestic crop is under
stress, and temperatures will rise as the plants begin to
pollinate, the forecaster said.  “The market is adding weather-risk premium into prices,”
 Richard Feltes , the vice president of research at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Until
there is a widespread soaking rain in the eastern Midwest, the
crop will continue to decline daily.”  On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for December
delivery, the contract with the highest open interest, rose 0.7
percent to close at $5.54 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. This week, the
price surged 9.5 percent, the most since May 2011. The grain has
declined 14 percent this year.  Corn futures for July delivery climbed 0.8 percent to
$5.91. Options on the contract expired today.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$13.755. The most-active contract gained 4.7 percent this week.
This year, the oilseed has climbed 14 percent, the biggest gain
among 24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
