Kenya ’s shilling snapped a seven-day
rally, sliding from a six-week high, as businesses sought to
acquire dollars following the gains.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy depreciated
as much as 0.9 percent to 84.33 per dollar and was trading 0.7
percent weaker at 84.17 by 12:04 p.m. in the capital Nairobi.  “The weakening of the shilling is weighed down by
businesses taking profits and increased demand for dollars from
oil importers as they seek to accumulate dollars on the recent
gains,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , said in an note to
clients. “We expect the market to trade within the 83.70 to
84.50 levels today.”  The Kenya shilling gained 2.2 percent in the seven days
through yesterday, closing at 83.55 per dollar, the highest
since May 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank did not offer repurchase agreements and
term-auction deposits for a third day today, a central bank
official who asked not to be identified in line with policy
said. The bank reintroduced term-auction deposits as a
“liquidity management” measure on June 5.  Uganda ’s shilling gained 0.2 percent to 2,463.50 per
dollar, while Tanzania’s currency appreciated by 0.2 percent to
1,578 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
