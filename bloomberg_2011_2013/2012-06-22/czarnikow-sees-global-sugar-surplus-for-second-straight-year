The global sugar surplus in 2012-13
will be 8.4 million metric tons, up from 7.8 million tons
estimated for 2011-12, Czarnikow Group Ltd. said in its first
forecast for the new season.  Sugar cane production may rise to a record 144.1 million
tons in 2012-13, up from 139.2 million tons a year earlier, the
London-based company said in an e-mailed report today. Sugar 
beet output may drop to 36.9 million tons, or 2.4 million tons
less than the 2011-12 record.  “The 2012-13 season is set to deliver a second successive
global production surplus,” Czarnikow analyst Peter de Klerk
said in the statement. “As a consequence supply risks are
continuing to ease.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
