OAO MRSK Holding (MRSK)  tumbled for an
eighth day, the longest streak of declines in almost a year,
after Kommersant reported the country’s largest electricity
distribution company may issue new shares.  MRSK lost 2 percent to 1.608 rubles by the close in Moscow,
the longest losing streak since August 2011.  The company should issue additional shares to attract
investors and raise funds for investments,  Kommersant  reported
today, citing Energy Minister Alexander Novak.  “The new share issues imply dilution of existing
minorities,” Alfa Bank analysts led by Alexander Kornilov said
in an e-mailed note. “We doubt the government will be
successful finding bidders for these assets after it has
completely undermined the investment climate in utilities.”  -- Editors: Alex Nicholson, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
