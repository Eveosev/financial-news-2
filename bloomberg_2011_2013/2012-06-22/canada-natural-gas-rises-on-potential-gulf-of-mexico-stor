Canadian natural gas gained on
speculation that a potential tropical storm in the  Gulf of
Mexico  may disrupt U.S. production.  July gas in  Alberta  rose 1.5 percent as energy platforms in
the Gulf began evacuations. A weather system off the Yucatan
Peninsula threatened to grow into a tropical storm over the
weekend. Gas rose yesterday after the U.S.  reported  a smaller-
than-average inventory gain that helped cut a surplus for the
11th straight week.  “The scare there is always of tropical storms doing
something significant,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research
with IAF Advisors in Houston. “I think it’s a continuation of a
bullish inventory number and expectations for next week are
pretty low. We are going to whittle down the surplus.”  Alberta gas for July delivery increased 3 cents to C$1.9875
gigajoule ($1.83 per million British thermal units) as of 4:40
p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian internet market. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system. NGX gas
is down 24 percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  advanced 4.3 cents, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $2.625
per million Btu.  U.S. inventories rose 62 billion cubic feet for the week
ended June 15 to 3.006 trillion, below the five-year average
gain of 87 billion for the week, according to the U.S. Energy
Department. A  surplus  to the five-year average narrowed to 27
percent from a six-year high of 61 percent the end of March.  Hot Weather  Temperatures will be above normal across most of the lower
48 states from June 27 through July 6, according to the  National
Weather Service . The high in Dallas on June 25 will be 103
degrees Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), according to AccuWeather Inc.
in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago rose
0.4 cent, or 0.2 percent, to $2.5303 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas declined 0.5 cent to $2.1947 per million Btu. At
Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, prices fell 0.59 cent to $2.3028 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet at 3 p.m.  New York  time.  Flow Rates  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.87 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.84 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 836 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.78 billion cubic feet today, or 68 percent
of normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.963
billion cubic feet at 3:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
