U.S. commercial banks earned $7
billion in revenue by trading over-the-counter derivatives and
securities in the first quarter, down 5 percent from the year-
earlier period as credit trading slowed.  Banks lost $784 million in credit trading for the three
months ended in March, compared with a gain of $1.7 billion in
the first quarter of 2011, the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency  said  in a release today. The U.S. agency said its main
measure of credit risk in derivatives markets, the so-called net
current credit exposure, fell 12 percent, or $53 billion, to
$377 billion.  The banks, including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS) , made a record $25.8 billion in revenue
by trading OTC derivatives and securities last year, the
regulator said earlier this year.  The OCC data only captures U.S.-based commercial banks, so
dealers such as Deutsche Bank AG aren’t accounted for. The
revenues combine private OTC derivatives and cash securities
trading, which OCC doesn’t break out by asset type.  To contact the reporter on this story:
