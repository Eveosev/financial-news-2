Japanese  stocks  fell snapped a two-
day rally as U.S. housing and jobs data missed estimates,
stoking concern the global economy is slowing. Shares pared
losses as the yen’s drop to a five-week low against the dollar
lifted exporters’ outlook.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 27 percent of its
revenue in the Americas, lost 0.8 percent.  Mitsui & Co. (8031)  led
trading companies lower as commodities entered a  bear market .
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)  lost 1.1 percent after 15
global banks were downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service.
 Olympus Corp. (7733)  gained 2.2 percent on a report  Sony Corp. (6758)  is in
final talks to invest in the scandal-hit optics maker.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.3 percent to 8,798.35
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in  Tokyo , trimming earlier losses
of as much as 1 percent. The gauge added 2.7 percent this week,
capping a third weekly advance. The broader Topix Index dropped
0.4 percent to 750.92 today.  “All the data yesterday pointed to a slowdown, and we
can’t expect immediate stimulus measures,” said Isao Kubo, a
Tokyo-based equity strategist at Nissay Asset Management Corp.,
which oversees about $62 billion. “Japanese stocks are falling,
but they remain resilient because of the yen. The currency is
the biggest barometer for  Japan ’s corporate outlook.”  The Topix fell 14 percent from this year’s peak on March 27
amid concern policy measures won’t be enough to support a global
economy hindered by  Europe ’s debt crisis and a slowdown in  China 
and U.S. Shares on the index are valued at 0.89 times book value.
A number below one means a company can be bought for less than
the value of its assets.  U.S. Data  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.3
percent today after bank credit downgrades announced by Moody’s
Investors Service matched expectations. The gauge fell 2.2
percent yesterday after reports showed more Americans than
expected filed claims for jobless benefits and sales of existing
homes fell. Stocks also fell after a survey yesterday showed
manufacturing in China may have contracted for an eighth month.  Canon lost 0.8 percent to 3,250 yen. Otsuka Holdings Co., a
drugmaker that gets a third of its sales in the U.S., slid 0.2
percent to 2,371 yen.  Finance stocks retreated after Moody’s downgraded some of
the world’s biggest lenders, although no Japanese banks’ ratings
were cut. Mitsubishi UFJ lost 1.1 percent to 368 yen, and
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest
lender by market value, dropped 1 percent to 2,513 yen.  The  Federal Reserve  on June 20 cut its U.S. growth forecast
and said it will extend a program called Operation Twist to
replace short-term bonds with longer-term debt.  Yen Falls  The yen weakened to a one-month low against the dollar as
the yield premium of two-year U.S. Treasury notes over
comparable Japanese government debt widened. A weaker yen boosts
the value of exporters’ earnings when brought back home. The
MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index fell 1.4 percent.  “Employment and housing sectors remain sluggish in the  U.S.
economy , boosting the need to counter a slowdown with monetary
policy,” saidTomoichiro Kubota, a market analyst at Matsui
Securities Co. “The yen has stabilized, providing a floor for
Japan’s stocks.”  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s second-largest carmaker by market
value, rose 0.8 percent to 2,686 yen. Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s
third-largest carmaker by market value, slid 1.8 percent to 748
yen after saying Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  is
considering stepping down before the company’s next mid-term
business plan begins in about five years.  Traders and energy firms fell after the S&P GSCI
commodities gauge slid to the lowest level since 2010 and down
22 percent from a February peak, meeting the definition of
entering a bear market. Oil fell below $80 a barrel for the
first time in eight months.  Commodity Stocks  Mitsui dropped 1.2 percent to 1,159 yen.  Inpex Corp. (1662) ,
Japan’s No. 1 energy explorer, declined 2.5 percent to 452,500
yen. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. slid 3.2 percent to 3,005
yen.  Bridgestone Corp., the world’s biggest maker of tires, lost
1.2 percent to 1,755 yen after saying it may extend output cuts
in the second half due to slumping demand.  Among stocks that advanced, Olympus added 2.2 percent to
1,196 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported Sony may invest
about 50 billion yen for a 10 percent stake. Sony rose 5.6
percent to 1,163 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 0.8 percent to 20.75,
the lowest since May 2, indicating traders expect a swing of
about 5.9 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
