Yields on  Colombia ’s  interest-rate
swaps  fell to a four-month low as the slowest economic growth
since 2010 fueled speculation the central bank will cut
borrowing costs after nine increases in the past 15 months.  The yield on three-month interest-rate swaps fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.04 percent at 9:54 a.m. in
Bogota, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest level on a closing basis since Feb. 13.  The current level indicates traders expect Banco de la
Republica to cut the overnight lending rate, which is now at
5.25 percent, within the next three months. That differs from a
central bank survey published June 13 showing most analysts
expect policy makers to raise the target rate by a quarter-
percentage point in December.  “With growth slumping in  Europe  and  oil prices  falling,
the central bank will need to cut rates to stimulate growth,”
said Guillermo Puentes, the head trader at Banco de Comercio
Exterior de Colombia SA, known as Bancoldex.  Gross domestic product  grew 4.7 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, the national statistics agency said
yesterday. That was down from 6.1 percent in the last three
months of 2011 and the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of
2010.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 rose two basis points to 7.02 percent,
according to the central bank.  Colombia’s peso depreciated 0.5 percent to 1,787 per
dollar. It has gained 8.5 percent this year, the best
performance among all 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
