Four-time Grand Slam champion  Kim Clijsters  pulled out of the semifinals of the Unicef Open in the
Netherlands because of an abdominal injury, the women’s WTA
tennis tour said.  Clijsters, who missed the clay-court season because of a
hip injury, had been scheduled to play Poland’s Urszula Radwanska today in Rosmalen.  The Belgian’s withdrawal is “preventative” to make sure
her goal of trying to win her first  Wimbledon  singles title
isn’t affected, her coach Carl Maes told reporters. She is
“very disappointed” to pull out of an event that’s so close to
home, Maes said.  Clijsters, who will retire after the U.S. Open, plays
former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic of  Serbia  in the opening
round of Wimbledon, which starts June 25.  Clijsters, 29, has won three  U.S. Open  titles and one
Australian Open championship. She missed Wimbledon last year
because of a foot injury.  Editor: Alex Duff  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
