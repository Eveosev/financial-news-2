Slovakia ratified the establishment
of a permanent bailout fund, the euro region’s main vehicle for
fighting the lingering debt crisis.  Lawmakers in Bratislava, Slovakia, voted 118 to 20, with
five abstentions, today to approve the 500 billion-euro ($628
billion) measure. The so-called European Stability Mechanism was
approved by Finland yesterday.  European leaders are relying on the funds to prevent the
spreading of the region’s debt crisis, which has left four
countries, including  Spain , in need of financial assistance. The
permanent bailout fund will succeed the temporary European
Financial Stability Facility, or EFSF, which has been used to
provide emergency loans to Ireland, Portugal and  Greece .  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, rattled financial
markets in October when it held up the enhancement of the ESM’s
predecessor. The ESM is due to become operational next month,
once the treaty has been approved by other euro area states
including  Germany , representing at least 90 percent of its
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
