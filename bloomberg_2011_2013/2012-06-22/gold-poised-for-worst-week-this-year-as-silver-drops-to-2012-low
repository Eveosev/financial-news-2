Gold advanced for the first time in
five days in  New York , trimming the biggest weekly loss in more
than six months, as Europe’s worsening debt crisis spurs demand
for the metal as a hedge.  German business confidence fell to a two-year low in June,
data today showed, while Spain’s 10-year borrowing costs rose
above the 7 percent level this week for the first time in 15
years. Gold erased its gains for the year yesterday after the
 Federal Reserve  on June 20 cut its forecast for 2012 U.S. growth
and extended Operation Twist, an economic stimulus plan to buy
longer-maturing debt. The central bank refrained from additional
bond purchases.  “Now that the Fed meeting is out of the way and the
stimulus premium is gone, we are seeing people come back to gold
at current levels,”  James Cordier , the founder of
Optionsellers.com in Tampa, Florida, said in a telephone
interview. “Gold is getting some safe-haven bids today.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose 0.1 percent to settle
at $1,566.90 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Still, prices slipped 3.8 percent this week mainly because of a
3.1 percent slump yesterday and as commodities entered a  bear
market .  “Gold does not do well in a deflationary environment,”
 Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Silver futures for September delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$26.724 an ounce, after earlier slipping to $26.57, the lowest
since Dec. 29. The metal retreated 7 percent this week.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery slid 0.5 percent to $1,431.20 an ounce, declining
for the sixth straight session, the longest since May 14.
Palladium futures for September delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
$607.20 an ounce, extending the weekly loss to 3.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
