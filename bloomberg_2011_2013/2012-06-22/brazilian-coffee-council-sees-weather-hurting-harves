Rain is hurting the coffee harvest
in  Brazil  and compromising the quality of the beans, said the
National Coffee Council, known as the CNC, a group that
represents producers.  Heavy rain may also prevent Brazil’s coffee from producing
enough to meet domestic and foreign demand, said Silas Brasileiro, the president of CNC, in a weekly report sent by e-
mail today.  Coffee futures for September delivery fell 1.8 percent to
$1.559 a pound on ICE, paring its weekly advance to 2.6 percent,
the first in more than a month.  The price jumped 4.2 percent yesterday on concern that
heavy rains in growing areas of Brazil will delay the harvest
and hurt the crop quality. Brazil is the world’s biggest
producer.  Coffee prices have fallen 33 percent since Dec. 30
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brasileiro said prices
should start rising by September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
