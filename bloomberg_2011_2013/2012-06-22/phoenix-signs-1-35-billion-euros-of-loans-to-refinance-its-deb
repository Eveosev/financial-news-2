Phoenix Group , a German
pharmaceutical distributor, signed 1.35 billion euros ($1.7
billion) of loans to refinance and reduce debt.  The facility is divided between a four-year, 300 million-
euro term loan and a 1.05 billion-euro, five-year revolving
credit facility, according to an e-mailed statement from
UniCredit SpA, one of the arrangers. The new debt will replace
1.485 billion euros left in a facility that was originally for
2.6 billion euros, according to the statement.  UniCredit, HSBC Holdings Plc, Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg
and Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen Girozentrale arranged the loans
as so-called coordinating bookrunners, according to the
statement. There are 15 lenders in the bank group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
