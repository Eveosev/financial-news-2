Nintendo Co. (7974) , the world’s largest
maker of video-game machines, will introduce a bigger version of
its 3DS handheld player next month in  Japan  to help revive
profit after posting its first annual loss.  The 3DS LL will go on sale in the domestic market on July
28 for 18,900 yen ($235), the Kyoto, Japan-based company said in
a statement today. The current model is priced at 15,000 yen.
Nintendo will start to sell the machine in the U.S. from Aug. 19
where it will cost $199.99 and be called the 3DS XL, spokesman
 Yasuhiro Minagawa  said by phone.  The creator of “Super Mario” predicts a 37 percent jump
in sales of the 3DS, together with the introduction of its new
Wii U console, will help drive a return to profit this fiscal
year. Nintendo posted a 43.2 billion yen  loss  in the year ended
March, turning unprofitable for the first time since it listed
in 1962.  “The player will lure customers as some opt for a larger
display,” said Takashi Oka, a Tokyo-based analyst at TIW Inc.
Still, “the machine’s impact won’t be big enough to create a
whole new market.”  Nintendo  rose  1.3 percent to 9,550 yen at the close on the
Osaka Securities Exchange.  The 3DS LL’s upper screen that can display 3-D images will
be enlarged to 4.88 inches, compared with the existing model’s
3.53 inches, Nintendo said. The handheld player will debut on
July 28 in  Europe  without the company setting a suggested retail
price, Minagawa said.  Nintendo will introduce “New Super Mario Bros. 2” and a
new version of its brain training game “Brain Age” along with
the 3DS LL, it said. The company has sold about 6.3 million 3DS
units in Japan since its debut in February 2011, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
