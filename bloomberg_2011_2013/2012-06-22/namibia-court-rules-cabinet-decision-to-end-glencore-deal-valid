Namibia ’s  Supreme Court  ruled a
Cabinet decision in 2010 to end an oil-import agreement
involving Glencore Energy UK Ltd. was valid.  The government acted within its powers to revoke the
mandate of the country’s state oil company to import half of
Namibia’s crude requirements, according to a copy of the
Windhoek-based court’s judgment, e-mailed today.  Namcor had entered in a joint venture with Glencore and
Petroneft International Ltd. in 2008 to source the oil, the
court said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
