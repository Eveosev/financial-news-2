Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the electric-car
maker led by entrepreneur Elon Musk, is pinning sales goals for
its new Model S sedan on an expanding network of stores, which
are modeled on the outlets of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   Direct deliveries to retail customers of the first eight of
the battery-powered models began today at Tesla’s factory in
Fremont, California. Musk has said the company already has
10,000 orders for the vehicle and will deliver 5,300 this year
and 20,000 next year.  “We’re opening up stores to get a run rate of reservations
to achieve that 20,000 rate,” George Blankenship, Tesla’s vice
president of sales, told reporters today in Fremont. “Every
time we open a store, people can’t wait to get there.”  The startup, named for inventor  Nikola Tesla , wants to
become profitable from sales of the Model S as early as next
year. Blankenship, who designed Apple’s stores before joining
Tesla, said the carmaker’s showrooms will be essential in
creating demand for its cars, as it eschews the traditional
auto-industry model of recruiting outside dealers to sell
vehicles.  The 10 new stores to be added this year will be mainly in
the Northeast U.S., as well as in  Portland , Oregon, and
Scottsdale, Arizona, Blankenship said. The expansion will take
the company’s showrooms to more than 30 this year. Tesla plans
to add between 25 and 30 more outlets next year, Blankenship
said.  “We’re getting an average of 4,000 visitors a week at our
stores,” he said. “How many car dealerships do you know of
that get 4,000 visitors a week?”  Prices for the Model S range from $57,400 to $105,400,
prior to a $7,500 federal tax credit, depending on options. The
top-end version can go as far as 265 miles (426 kilometers) per
charge.  The company, based in  Palo Alto , California, counts  Daimler
AG (DAI)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  as investors and has yet to post an
annual profit.  Tesla rose 5 percent to $33.79 today in New York. The
shares have gained 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
