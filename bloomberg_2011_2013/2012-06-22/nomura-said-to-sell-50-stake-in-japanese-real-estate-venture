Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s
largest brokerage, plans to sell its 50 percent stake in a real
estate joint venture to  Development Bank of Japan Inc. , said two
people with knowledge of the matter.  Nomura and Development Bank, its partner in Tokyo-based DBJ
Nomura Investment Co., are in final talks to shift full
ownership to the state-run lender, said the people, who asked
not to be named before an announcement. They declined to say how
much Development Bank would pay for the stake in the company,
which manages 50 billion yen ($624 million) of assets.  The Asahi newspaper reported the plans to end the
partnership earlier today. Keiko Sugai, a spokeswoman for Nomura
in  Tokyo , declined to comment.  “No decision has been made,” said Tetsuro Okita, a
spokesman for  Development Bank .  To contact the reporters on this story:
