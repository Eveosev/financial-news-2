Bank of America Corp. , the second-
largest  U.S. bank , said it will redeem $3.9 billion of trust-
preferred securities as the firm reduces costly debt.  Bank of America will use “excess liquidity” to repurchase
the instruments, which paid 6.25 percent to 10.5 percent
interest, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said today
in a statement. The lender said it has regulatory approvals for
the redemptions, which take effect July 25.  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan , 52, has been
reducing long-term debt since last year to cut interest costs
while raising capital to meet regulatory demands. Trust-
preferred securities won’t count as Tier 1 common equity under
coming rules set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  “This action reflects the work we’ve done to build record
levels of capital and liquidity,” Chief Financial Officer  Bruce Thompson  said in the statement. “We continue to look to
optimize the balance sheet.”  Bank of America retired $4.2 billion of debt for cash and
exchanged $730 million of trust-preferred securities for cash
and shares in the first quarter, the firm said in April. Those
actions helped improve Tier 1 common equity by $1.7 billion in
the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
