Germany ’s use of corn to make biogas
is reducing grain production as the crop competes for acreage,
hurting the country’s self-sufficiency in cereals, farm
organization Deutscher Raiffeisenverband e.V. said.  The cultivation of corn for biogas is expected to cut grain
supply by about 4 million metric tons this year, the Berlin-
based group wrote in an e-mailed statement today.  German farmers are forecast to harvest 41.5 million tons of
grain in the period, not enough to cover average demand of about
41.8 million tons, according to the DRV. Germany is the European
Union’s second-largest wheat grower and exporter, behind  France .  “We’re experiencing a politically-driven tightening of the
grain offer, which has to be compensated by increased imports of
grain substitutes such as soybeans,” Henning Ehlers, the DRV’s
director, was cited as saying in the statement.  The reduced supply of domestically grown grain is causing
rising feed costs and reduced competitiveness for the German
dairy and livestock industry, according to Ehlers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
