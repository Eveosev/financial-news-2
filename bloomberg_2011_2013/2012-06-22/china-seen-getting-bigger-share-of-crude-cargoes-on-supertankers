China  is poised to get a bigger
share of crude-oil cargoes carried on supertankers, according to
IHS Inc. ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg News.  The country is due to receive 13.5 percent of the worldâ€™s
very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, compared with 12.9 percent
a week ago. The ships have a combined carrying capacity of 18
million deadweight tons, or about 132 million barrels.  The table below shows the destinations, aggregated by
country, of 444 VLCCs. There are about 568 in the fleet. Drafts
show how deep the ships are on average in the water, expressed
as a percentage of the maximum. A figure of 100 indicates a ship
is likely to be full.  To contact the reporter on this story:
