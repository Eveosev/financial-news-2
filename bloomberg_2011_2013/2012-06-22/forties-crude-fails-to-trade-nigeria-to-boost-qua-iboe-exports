No bids or offers were made for
 North Sea  Forties and Russian Urals crude in Europe. Socar
Trading SA failed to sell Azeri Light at a lower price than the
last trade.  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, plans to increase
benchmark Qua Iboe crude exports in August to 12 cargoes, one
more than July, according to a loading schedule obtained by
Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 60 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, the lowest since April 24, compared with a discount
of 55 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Forties was last sold at a discount of 60 cents a barrel to
Dated Brent on June 20, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window.  Brent for August settlement traded at $90.44 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $90.49 yesterday. The September contract was
at $90.72, a premium of 28 cents to August.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals was at $1.80 a barrel less than Dated Brent in
northwest Europe, compared with a discount of $1.65 yesterday,
according to the Bloomberg data.  Socar Trading SA failed to sell 600,000 barrels of Azeri
crude for July 7 to July 11 loading from  Turkey ’s Ceyhan or
 Georgia ’s Supsa at $2.30 a barrel more than Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , compared with a premium of
$2.50 for the last trade on June 20, the survey showed.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold 140,000 metric tons of Urals via a
tender to Eni SpA for July 4 to July 5 loading from Novorossiysk
on the  Black Sea , said two traders who participate in the
market.  PT Pertamina bought three crude cargoes totaling 1.8
million barrels from Algeria and  Libya  for delivery in August,
according to a company official, who asked not to be identified
because the information is confidential.  Pertamina bought 600,000 barrels of Libya’s Amna crude for
its Cilacap refinery, and 600,000 barrels each of Libya’s El-
Sharara and Algeria’s Saharan Blend for its Balikpapan facility.  West Africa  Vitol didn’t manage to sell 950,000 barrels of Nigerian
Escravos for July 10 to July 15 delivery to Rotterdam or Lavera,
 France , at $4 a barrel more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Nigeria will export eight shipments of Agbami, four
Escravos, three Yoho, two Okwori and one Antan, separate plans
show. Agbami and Okwori cargoes are of 975,000 and 650,000
barrels each respectively, while the other grades are shipped in
950,000-barrel lots.  Hindustan Petroleum Corp. issued a tender to buy crude for
