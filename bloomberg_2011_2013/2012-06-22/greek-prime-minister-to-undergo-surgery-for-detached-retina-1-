Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
will have surgery to correct a detached retina tomorrow and
Finance Minister Vassilios Rapanos was hospitalized after he
collapsed in  Athens , officials said.  Samaras’s condition was discovered today during a routine
check-up, his office said in an e-mailed statement. Rapanos, who
was due to be sworn in today, was admitted to the Athens Hygeia
Hospital with symptoms including severe stomach pains, nausea
and exhaustion. His condition is stable and he will remain in
the hospital to undergo tests, Athens Hygeia said in an e-mailed
statement.  A retina can become detached when the thin lining at the
back of the eye separates from the blood vessels. Without
immediate treatment, the condition can lead to blindness in the
affected eye, according to information on the U.K. National
Health Service  website .  Samaras was sworn in on June 20 as head of the country’s
new coalition government after his New Democracy party finished
first in June 17 elections.  To contact the reporters on this story:
