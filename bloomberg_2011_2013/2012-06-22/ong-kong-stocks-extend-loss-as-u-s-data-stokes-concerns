Hong Kong   stocks  dropped, with the
benchmark index headed for a sixth weekly loss in seven weeks,
as commodities and energy producers dropped after U.S. home
sales and manufacturing data missed estimates, fueling concern
that global economic expansion is weakening.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of clothes and toys to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., dropped 4.2 percent. Cnooc Ltd.,  China ’s biggest
offshore energy explorer, lost 3.2 percent after crude oil fell

the sector to focus on growth.  The Hang Seng Index slipped 1 percent to 19,067.51 at
midday trading break, extending yesterday’s 1.3 percent retreat.

percent to 9,543.10.  “There will be further downside -- things are still

oversees about $270 billion. “You’re seeing a gradual weakening
of the ability of governments to step in.”  Hong Kong’s  benchmark index  fell 11 percent from this
year’s peak in February through yesterday amid concern economic
growth is slowing in the U.S. and China as Europe’s debt crisis
spreads. Companies on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  traded at about 10
times estimated earnings on average yesterday, compared with
12.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 10.4 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  U.S. Economy  Stocks generating revenue from the U.S. fell after the

according to figures from the National Association of Realtors
in Washington.  Li & Fung dropped 4.2 percent to HK$14.68.  Techtronic
Industries Co. (669) , a maker of power tools that relies on  North
America  for almost 75 percent of its sales, dropped 2.1 percent
to HK$8.89.  “The market is expecting slower growth and the data points
are dragging us to the downside now,” said Marco Li, Hong Kong-
based portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, which
oversees $208 billion globally. “People are looking beyond the
valuations and fundamentals right now and are focusing on how
bad the economy is. Things will have to worsen significantly to
have more stimulus coming.”  Bear Market  Cnooc (883)  lost 3.2 percent to HK$14.50 after crude oil traded
