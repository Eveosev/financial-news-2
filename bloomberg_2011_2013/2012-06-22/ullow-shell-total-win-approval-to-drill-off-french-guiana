Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Total SA (FP)  and
 Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  won French government approval to drill for oil
off French Guiana as they seek to build on last year’s landmark
find off the Latin American coast.  “I can confirm that drilling has been approved and will
resume” on June 25, government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-
Belkacem said today after a cabinet meeting in Paris.  The oil producers’ drilling plans were thrown into question
last week after former Ecology,  Sustainable Development  and
Energy Minister Nicole Bricq suspended exploration permits and
then did an about-face to reinstate the validity of those
already granted. The companies have a $1 million-a-day rig in
place to begin probing the deepwater Guyane Maritime permit in
 French Guiana , an overseas region of France bordering Brazil.  Bricq was replaced late yesterday after five weeks on the
job, with lawmaker Delphine Batho taking over the portfolio in a
cabinet shuffle following legislative elections.  Tullow made the first oil find in French Guiana last year
at the Zaedyus-1 well, opening a new frontier in  Latin America 
that could eclipse the explorer’s Jubilee field in Ghana. The
company planned to drill the Zaedyus-2 appraisal well this month
and the Dasypus-1 well later this year.  Tullow, Shell and Total have found light and heavy oil at
the French Guiana field, which may hold 840 million barrels of
gross reserves in the Demerara Plateau’s Eastern Slope frontier,
according to Tullow. The London-based explorer is the operator
of the Guyane Maritime license with a 27.5 percent stake, while
Shell has 45 percent, Total 25 percent and Northpet 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
