(Corrects spelling of name in headline. Story originally
was published on June 20.)  French President  Francois Hollande 
said European Union officials will discuss a financial
transaction tax at a meeting later this month after delegates at
a UN conference in Rio de Janeiro declined to adopt the plan.  “The text is a road map for our sustainable development
goals,” Hollande said at the Rio+20 summit today. “If we want
to reach the goals we set for development we need to mobilize
all the resources possible.”  Taxing financial transactions would generate new resources
needed to fund sustainable development projects around the
world, Hollande said.  European countries will discuss the tax at the end of June
at the European Council, even though “more liberal” nations
oppose to the measure, Hollande said.  “Some European countries may create this tax in the
context of what we call reinforced cooperation,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
