New York  Governor  Andrew Cuomo  plans
to call lawmakers back for a special session to handle
unfinished business, including the extension of a property-tax
rebate for more than 300,000 New York City residents that
expires June 30, said the Assembly speaker’s spokesman.  New York City lawmakers raised the issue yesterday, the
last day of the session, and Cuomo opted not to use his power to
put bills through the Legislature with less than three days
notice. Instead, he’ll bring lawmakers back to Albany, the state
capital, said Mike Whyland, a spokesman for Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.  “The governor indicated we’ll come back and deal with it
later,” Whyland said in an interview. “We still have time.”  Josh Vlasto , a Cuomo spokesman, didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail and phone call requesting comment.  The 17.5 percent property tax rebate was instituted in 1996
for condominium and co-op unit owners, Whyland said.  New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  wrote Cuomo to ask that
the rebate be curtailed because the city needs the revenue,
Cuomo said in a news conference yesterday. The city forgos $462
million annually, Crain’s New York Business has reported.  New York’s mayor is the founder and majority owner of
Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  Lawmakers are leaving Albany today with other unfinished
business as well, including a Cuomo proposal to decriminalize 25
grams or less of marijuana and a Silver-backed measure to raise
the minimum wage to $8.50 per hour from $7.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
