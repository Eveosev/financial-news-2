OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas
producer, agreed with Electricite de France SA to seek joint
acquisitions and consider building power generators in  Europe .  Gazprom will become the exclusive supplier to any joint
power projects under an agreement signed between Alexey Miller,
chief executive officer of Gazprom, and EDF CEO  Henri Proglio 
today at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, the
Russian gas producer and exporter said in an e-mailed statement.  As Russia’s gas export monopoly, Gazprom provides a quarter
of demand in Europe, while relying on the market as its main
source of profit. The Moscow-based company sought to enter
European power generation with Germany’s  RWE AG (RWE)  before talks
failed last year.  Gazprom is looking at buying into some of  Enel SpA (ENEL) ’s power
plants, including in  Belgium , and is considering assets owned by
Denmark’s Dong Energy A/S, Miller told reporters yesterday at
the forum. Talks with the Italian utility may be completed this
year, he said.  Gazprom plans to bid for a U.K. power plant put up for sale
by EDF Energy Plc, the Sunday Times reported earlier this month.
The plant, which supplies 800,000 homes, is at Sutton Bridge in
Lincolnshire, and EDF hired N.M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd. to run
the auction, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
