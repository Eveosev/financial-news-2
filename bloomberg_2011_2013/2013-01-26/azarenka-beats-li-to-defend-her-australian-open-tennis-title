Victoria Azarenka fought back to
beat Li Na in three sets to successfully defend her Australian
Open title and retain the top ranking in women’s tennis.  Top-seeded Azarenka of  Belarus  defeated the No. 6 seed from
China 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 at Rod Laver Arena in  Melbourne , where she
broke through for her first major title 12 months ago. Li took
medical timeouts in the second and third sets after going over
on her ankle.  Azarenka, 23, becomes the eighth woman to win the season-
opening tennis Grand Slam in consecutive years since the sport’s
Open era began in 1968. Her victory also guaranteed that she’ll
stay No. 1 on the tour.  It was Li’s second defeat in the championship match in
Melbourne in three years following her 2011 loss to  Kim
Clijsters . At 30 years, 335 days, Li had been trying to become
the oldest women’s winner in the Open era.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
