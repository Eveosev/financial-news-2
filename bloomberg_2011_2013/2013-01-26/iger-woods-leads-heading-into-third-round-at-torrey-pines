Tiger Woods moved into first place,
two strokes ahead of Billy Horschel, as he heads into the third
round of the U.S. PGA Tour’s Farmers Insurance Open.  Woods carded a 7-under 65 yesterday to finish the second
round 11-under at 133 at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, California.
He has won six Farmers Insurance titles and one U.S. Open on the
course.  “I played well today,” Woods said after completing his
round. “I drove the ball well and took advantage of the par-
5s.”  Horschel birdied three of his last five holes to record a
3-under 69. He is at 9-under 133 after two days.  Erik Compton hit a 65 to move into third place at 8-under
136 along with Brad Fritsch, Steve Marino, Jimmy Walker, Casey
Wittenberg and Josh Teater.  Phil Mickelson had a 1-under 71 to make the cut after he
birdied the third and sixth.  “My game is just a little bit off,” Mickelson said. “I’m
throwing some shots away, missing some short putts and yet, I
don’t feel bad on the greens.”  The Farmers tournament is played over the North and South
courses at Torrey Pines with the winner collecting $1.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
