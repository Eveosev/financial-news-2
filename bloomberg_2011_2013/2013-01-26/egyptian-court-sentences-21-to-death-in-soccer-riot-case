Egypt ’s army was deployed in Port
Said after 27 people were killed in clashes between police and
supporters of 21 defendants sentenced to death for their role in
the nation’s worst-ever soccer disaster.  The rioting began in the city after a criminal court handed
down sentences earlier today for those convicted of killing more
than 70 fans during a game on Feb. 1 between Port Said’s al-
Masri team and Cairo’s al-Ahly club. More than 300 people were
injured, Abdel Rahman Farah, head of hospitals at Port Said
Health Authority, said by phone.  The violence over the soccer-deaths case followed overnight
clashes between security forces and opponents of President
Mohamed Mursi that left at least nine people dead and 534
injured, the Health Ministry said. The nationwide demonstrations
were held on the second anniversary of the uprising that ousted
 Hosni Mubarak .  A final verdict in the soccer case is scheduled for March
9. It will come after a review by the Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa,
Egypt’s highest religious authority, the court in Cairo said.  The military was deployed early today in Suez, site of the
majority of the fatalities, in a bid to protect state
institutions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
