England’s Chris Wood made eagle on
the final hole to win golf’s Qatar Masters and earn his first
career victory on the European Tour.  Wood holed out a five-iron from 202 yards at Doha Golf Club
to beat  Sergio Garcia  of Spain and  South Africa ’s George Coetzee
by one stroke. The 25-year-old previously had three runner-up
finishes on the European Tour.  Wood took a three-stroke lead into today’s round and
finished at 18-under par after shooting 3-under 69. Coetzee shot
today and Garcia had 66.  Sweden’s Noren Alexander and England’s Steve Webster tied
for fourth place at 13 under, one shot better than Englishmen
