U.S. soybean production will jump 12
percent this year as farmers plant more and yields recover from
last year’s drought, according to broker Allendale Inc.  Production of the crop that farmers will start sowing in in
May will rise to 3.364 billion bushels from 3.015 billion last
year, Allendale said today in a statement at its annual
conference in Crystal Lake,  Illinois . Farmers will seed 78.7
million acres, up from 77.2 million last year, and yields will
rise to 43.4 bushels an acre from 39.6, the company said.  Inventories on Aug. 31, 2014, will total 164 million
bushels, up from an estimated from 136 million a year earlier,
which was forecast by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  on Jan.
11, according to the report. Allendale forecast stockpiles at
the end of the current marketing year at 140 million bushels.  Exports of soybeans from the U.S., the world’s biggest
shipper, will jump 1.4 percent to 1.4 billion bushels from an
estimated 1.345 billion a year earlier, according to the report.
The average cash price, pegged by Allendale at $14 a bushel in
the year through Aug. 31, will fall to $11.50 next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
