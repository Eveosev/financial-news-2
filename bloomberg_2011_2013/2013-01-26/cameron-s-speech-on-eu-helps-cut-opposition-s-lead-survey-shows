An increase in Conservative support
has seen the U.K. opposition  Labour Party ’s lead over Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s party halved after his speech on Europe
last week, according to a ComRes opinion poll for the
Independent on Sunday and Sunday Mirror.  Support for Cameron’s  Conservative Party  has risen 5
points, to 33 percent, while Labour’s remains unchanged from
last month on 39 percent, the poll shows. Support for the
 Liberal Democrats  has increased 2 points, to 11 percent, while
the U.K. Independence Party, which campaigns for an exit from
the European Union, has seen its support fall by 4 points to 10
percent.  Asked how they would vote if a referendum were held on
Britain’s membership in the EU, 43 percent of those polled said
they were in favor of leaving, a decline of 3 points compared
with a similar survey in May 2012. Support for the U.K. leaving
the EU regardless of a vote has dropped by 10 points, to 33
percent.  The number of those who believe leaving the EU would be bad
for the British economy in terms of lost jobs and trade has
risen two points to 38 percent, according to ComRes.  ComRes interviewed 2,035 adults online between Jan. 23 and
Jan. 25. The data was weighted to be demographically
representative of all adults and by past vote recall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
