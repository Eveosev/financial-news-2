Baltimore Ravens strong safety
Bernard Pollard has been fined $15,250 for unnecessary roughness
by the  National Football League , the Baltimore Sun reported,
citing a person familiar with the disciplinary action.  Pollard hit New England Patriots wide receiver Wes Welker
in the head and neck area during the third quarter of the
American Football Conference championship game Jan. 20.  Earlier, Patriots quarterback  Tom Brady  was fined $10,000
for his slide that resulted in a kick to safety Ed Reed’s leg in
the game.  The Ravens won 28-13 to advance to the Super Bowl where
they will meet the San Francisco 49ers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
