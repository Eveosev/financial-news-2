Li Na took the first set of the
Australian Open women’s final against defending champion
Victoria Azarenka.  The sixth-seed from  China  took the set 6-4 when Azarenka
double faulted.  Li, who became the first Asian-born player to win a Grand
Slam tennis singles title at the 2011 French Open, is trying to
become the oldest woman to win the Australian Open in the
professional era. Azarenka, the top-seed from Belarus, would
retain the No. 1 ranking in women’s tennis should she win today
at the Rod Laver Arena.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
