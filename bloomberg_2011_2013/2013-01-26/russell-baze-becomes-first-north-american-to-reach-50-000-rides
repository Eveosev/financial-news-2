Russell Baze became the first North
American jockey to make his 50,000th career start when he rode
Finish Rich in NYC to third place at  Golden Gate  Fields
racetrack in Berkeley,  California .  Baze, 54, was aboard his milestone mount in the sixth race
yesterday at Golden Gate. He rode six horses, earning three
firsts, one second and one third place.  Since Jan. 1, 1976, Baze, the North American all-time
leading jockey by wins, has ridden races that cover 343,354
furlongs, which equals 42,919 1/4 miles (69,057 kilometers),
according to Equibase Co. He has spent 1,144 1/2 hours or almost
48 days in the saddle based on calculations of one furlong being
covered in 12 seconds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
