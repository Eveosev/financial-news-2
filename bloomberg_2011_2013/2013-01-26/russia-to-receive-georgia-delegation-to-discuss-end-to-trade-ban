Russia  will issue visas to an
official Georgian delegation for talks on reopening its market
to wine and  mineral water  from the former Soviet state.  The Russian interests section at the Swiss Embassy in
Georgia will issue the visas, the foreign ministry in Moscow
said in a statement posted on its website today. Russia’s public
health chief Gennady Onishchenko said Jan. 24 that the
negotiations are due to take place in Moscow early next month,
state news service RIA Novosti reported.  Russia welcomes the “positive signals” sent by Georgia,
President  Vladimir Putin  said Dec. 20. Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, who came to power after the defeat of Western-
allied President Mikheil Saakashvili’s party in October
elections, has called for better ties with Russia.  Russia in 2006 imposed a ban on Georgian wine, mineral
water and agricultural products after a spy scandal, depriving
the Caucasus nation of its biggest foreign market. It extended
the embargo to postal and transport links after the two
countries in 2008 fought a war over a Georgian breakaway region.
While flights restarted in 2010, the trade ban is still active.  To contact the reporter on this story:
