Dole Food Co. (DOLE)  settled a lawsuit
claiming the world’s biggest producer of fresh fruit and
vegetables misled consumers about the environmental practices on
a contractor’s banana plantation in  Guatemala .  Lawyers for the plaintiff, a California resident who said
he wouldn’t have bought Dole’s bananas had he known the truth
about the conditions at the plantation, filed a request to
dismiss the case today in federal court in Los Angeles.  Dole, based in Westlake Village, California, said in a
statement today that it will collaborate with nonprofit Water
and Sanitation Health Inc. on a water filter project for
communities in Guatemala. The company said in the statement that
it denies the allegations in the lawsuit.  “Dole has reached this resolution because it believes
continued outreach and education regarding water sanitation
techniques will benefit the local communities,” the company
said in the statement.  The case is Laderer v. Dole Food Company Inc., 12-09715,
U.S. District Court, Central District of  California  (Los
Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
