(Corrects percentage of victory in second paragraph.)    Singapore ’s Workers’ Party
candidate Lee Li Lian won a parliamentary seat after defeating
three others in an unexpected loss for Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong’s ruling party.  The opposition candidate won about 54 percent of valid
votes in the Punggol East constituency, Returning Officer Yam Ah
Mee said in televised broadcast, extending the opposition’s
record presence in Parliament. The seat was previously held by
the People’s  Action Party , whose candidate won the ward in
northeastern Singapore in general elections in 2011 with 54.5
percent of the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
