Defending champion  Victoria Azarenka 
won the second set 6-4 to tie her Australian Open women’s final
against China’s  Li Na .  The sixth-seed Li took the first set 6-4 when Azarenka
double faulted. The Belarussian won the first three games of the
second set, and then Li came back to tie it at 4-4. Azarenka got
a break and held to take the set.  Li, who became the first Asian-born player to win a Grand
Slam tennis singles title at the 2011 French Open, is trying to
become the oldest woman to win the Australian Open in the
professional era. Azarenka, the top-seed, would retain the No. 1
ranking in women’s tennis should she win today at the Rod Laver
Arena.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
