Police in Azerbaijan’s capital Baku
arrested nearly 50 people as they stopped a rally in support of
anti-government protests and riots that hit the northwestern
Ismayilli District this week.  The protesters chanted “Get your guns off us” and “Baku
supports Ismayilli” before being detained by riot police and
plainclothes security officers and driven away in buses.  Almost 5,000 people had signed up on  Facebook Inc. (FB)  to join
the rally in central Fountains Square. Police sealed off the
area hours before the protest started, forcing demonstrators to
gather in neighboring streets.  Residents in Ismayilli, about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
northwest of Baku, burned the local governor’s house and a hotel
in two days of rioting earlier this week. Police used tear gas,
rubber bullets and water cannons to disperse the demonstrations
and dozens of people were arrested.  To contact the reporter on this story:
