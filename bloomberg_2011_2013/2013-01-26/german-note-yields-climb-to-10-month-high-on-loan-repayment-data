German  two-year notes  fell for a
fourth week, pushing yields to a 10-month  high , amid speculation
the debt crisis is abating after the  European Central Bank  said
banks plan to repay more loans than analysts estimated.  Portugal ’s 10-year government bond yield dropped to the
lowest level in more than two years after the nation sold notes
via banks, moving a step closer to regaining access to long-term
debt markets. The country’s  two-year  note rate slid below 3
percent for the first time since October 2010. The yield on
Italian 10-year bonds fell to the least since November 2010 as
investors sought higher-yielding assets.  The loan repayment is “above market consensus and it may
put some pressure on the front end of core markets” such as
 Germany , said Mohit Kumar, the head of European interest-rate
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in  London , referring to shorter-
dated maturities. “Banks can afford and are comfortable to
repay because the global backdrop is improving.”  German two-year note yields climbed eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, in the week to 0.26 percent at 5 p.m. in
London yesterday. The rate rose to 0.28 percent yesterday, the
most since March 22. The zero percent security due in December
2014 fell 0.135, or 1.35 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,346) face
amount, to 99.52.  Benchmark 10-year bund yields increased eight basis points
to 1.64 percent, after climbing to 1.65 percent, the  highest 
level since Oct. 18.  Loan Repayment  The two-year notes of  France ,  Austria , the Netherlands,
 Finland  and Belgian all posted weekly declines after the ECB
said 278 financial institutions will pay back 137.2 billion
euros of three-year loans on Jan. 30. That compares with the
median forecast of 84 billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists. The ECB’s first three-year loan totalled 489
billion euros and banks can continue to make early repayments in
coming weeks.  Portugal’s 10-year yield fell to 5.80 percent on Jan. 23,
the lowest since Oct. 27, 2010. The rate rose one basis point in
the week to 6.13 percent.  Fitch Ratings  said Portugal’s sale of five-year notes
through banks on Jan. 23 was “positive for its credit
profile.” The nation sold 2.5 billion euros of the securities,
the first offering of that maturity in almost two years. The
sale attracted bids for 12 billion euros of debt, Secretary of
State for Treasury Maria Luis Albuquerque said at a Jan. 23
press conference.  Italy ’s 10-year yield fell to as low as to 4.07 percent,
the least since Nov. 10, 2010. The nation is scheduled to
auction as much as 6.75 billion euros of notes due 2014 and
inflation-linked securities due 2018 on Jan. 28. Finland is set
to sell 1 billion euros of 2028 securities a day later and
Germany will offer 2 billion euros of 30-year bunds on Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
