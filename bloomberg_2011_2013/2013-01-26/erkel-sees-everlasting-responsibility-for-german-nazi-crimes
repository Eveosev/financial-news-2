Germany ’s responsibility for crimes
committed by the National Socialists will never expire,
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  said on at an event to mark the 80th
anniversary of Adolf Hitler’s accession to power.  Germany has an “everlasting responsibility for the crimes
of National Socialism, for the victims of World War II and,
above all, for the Holocaust,” Merkel said in a video message.
“And this must be made clear from generation to generation and
it must be said with bravery and moral courage, every individual
can make a contribution so that racism and antisemitism have no
chance.”  On Jan. 30, Merkel will visit Berlin’s  Topography of Terror
Documentation Center , built on the foundations of the
headquarters of the Secret State Police, the SS and the Reich
Security Main Office, which were destroyed during the war.  Exactly 80 years earlier, Hitler, leader of the National
Socialist German Workers’ Party, was sworn in as chancellor by
President Paul von Hindenburg. Two months later, a so-called
Enabling Act allowed Hitler’s government to pass laws without
parliamentary control and in violation of the constitution,
paving the way for his dictatorship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
