Saint-Emilion winegrower Chateau
Cheval Blanc and top Burgundy  Romanee-Conti  Domaine de la
Romanee Conti were among leading lots at a Zachys wine auction
in Hong Kong this month before the Chinese New Year holiday.  A case of Cheval Blanc’s 1947 vintage sold for HK$1.23.
million ($158,000), just beating the price fetched by a similar
case at Zachys in Hong Kong in September and reflecting its
perfect 100-point score from U.S. critic  Robert Parker . Three
bottles of Romanee Conti 1999 DRC sold for HK$318,500, slightly
more expensive than the Cheval Blanc on a per-bottle basis.  Demand at the sale was driven by  China ’s Golden Week
celebrations next month amid signs of a recovery in fine wine
demand since the start of this month following a sell-off in
2011 and early 2012. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of leading
clarets has risen for three of the past six months, after
declining for the previous four.  Other top lots at the  Zachys  sale, held Jan. 11 and Jan. 12
and marking the start of the New Year season, included 12
bottles of Chevalier Montrachet Domaine d’Auvenay 1993 white
Burgundy, of which only 73 cases were produced. It sold for
$116,375, above its presale estimate.  Other sales taking place this month include  Acker Merrall &
Condit ’s two-day  Hong Kong  auction finishing today, which
includes a case of Chateau Petrus 1982 and three bottles of the
rarer 1961 vintage from the same producer, and a  Sotheby’s (BID)  sale
scheduled for Jan. 30 in London.  Burgundy Attention  The Zachys and Acker sales will give an early indication of
demand from China in the first quarter of this year as
investors’ attention has switched increasingly to rarer Burgundy
vintages from the Bordeaux that initially drove the market.  Hong Kong’s share of wine sales by the world’s five leading
auction houses slipped to 49 percent in the first quarter of
last year from 57 percent a year earlier as the U.S. and  Europe 
recouped market share. It was 43 percent for the whole of 2012.  Following is a table of percentage wine sales for the
leading regions, based on data compiled by Bloomberg from the
five auction houses. The figures exclude internet-only sales and
major charity events.  To contact the reporter on the story:
