Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index
rose the most in two weeks, led by banks, petrochemicals and
telecommunication companies, amid optimism about fourth-quarter
earnings and gains in U.S. equities.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s biggest bank by market value,
climbed to the highest since Jan. 20.  Saudi Basic Industries
Corp. (SABIC) , known as Sabic, advanced the most in more than two weeks,
while  Saudi Telecom Co. (STC)  increased the most in a week.  The Tadawul All Share Index added 0.4 percent to 7,025.31
at the close in Riyadh, the biggest gain since Jan. 12.  “Investors are optimistic after the release of annual
preliminary results of companies last week,” Turki Fadaak, head
of research and consultancy at Albilad Investment Co., wrote in
an e-mail. “This week will give important indications on how
investors will behave towards those results.”  U.S. stocks rose for an eighth day yesterday, the longest
winning streak since 2004. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  has
climbed to the highest level since December 2007 and is poised
for a third straight month of gains after advancing 5.4 percent
so far in January.  Energy producers and health-care companies have  led the
U.S. rally , adding at least 7.2 percent. The S&P 500 is trading
at 14.9 times reported earnings, below the average since 1954 of
16.5, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Al Rajhi Bank increased 0.7 percent to 69.5 riyals today.
Sabic, the world’s largest petrochemical maker, rose 0.8 percent
to 93.25 riyals, and STC climbed 2.2 percent to 41.8 riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
