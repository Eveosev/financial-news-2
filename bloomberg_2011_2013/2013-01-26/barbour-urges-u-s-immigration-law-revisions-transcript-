Former Mississippi Governor and
Republican National Committee Chairman  Haley Barbour  said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that U.S. immigration laws need to
be changed and urged his party to reach out to minorities.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

former Mississippi Governor and RNC Chair Haley Barbour. Good to
be with you.  HALEY BARBOUR, FORMER GOVERNOR, MISSISSIPPI: Thank you, Al.
Thanks for having me back.  HUNT: Four years ago, at a very --  Barack Obama  was dancing
at his inaugural ball, there’s now a well-chronicled story of a
bunch of prominent Republicans meeting in a restaurant that you
owned at the time and plotting the way they were going to oppose
Obama and win back the House. They were at least partially
successful there. What’s the challenge Republicans face now,
compared to four years ago?  BARBOUR: Well, I think you need to start off that a lot of
Republicans think we could have won the election in ’12 for
president and for the Senate, that we didn’t run a very good
campaign.  Mitt Romney , I think, would have made a great
president. He is a wonderful human being. But his campaign
allowed him to be turned into an ogre for -- so many people in
the  United States  think he’s a rich white guy that doesn’t care
about the people like them.  So we have to come out with a better campaign in 2016.
We’ve got to face up to some demographic issues, you know. But,
remember, both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush did very well
among Hispanics. And Asian-Americans, who voted more for Obama
this time than Hispanics.  HUNT: Obama laid down the gauntlet in that inaugural
address. Did you see anything that you thought Republicans could
find common ground with him?  BARBOUR: Very little. And that was, of course, intentional.
And inaugural addresses --  State of the Union  addresses, that’s
not that unusual -- but for an inaugural address, I thought it
was quite unusual. He talked -- what he seemed interested in was
gun control, global warming, gay marriage. But when it came down
to talking about the budget, he essentially said, yeah, we ought
to reduce the deficit, but -- and here we’re going to spend this
money and spend this money and spend this money and spend this
money. And almost everything in there accented the polarization
that we have in the American political system today.  HUNT: You brought up the question of the Latino vote and
the Asian vote a minute ago. There’s now talk about immigration
reform, and some Republicans saying we have to get on the right
side of this and disavow that kind of platform we had before.
 George W. Bush , as you pointed out, did very well. He called for
a pathway to citizenship for all the 11 million undocumented or
illegal workers who are here now. Should Republicans embrace
that?  BARBOUR: Well, let me just start off by reminding your
viewers two presidents in our lifetime have pushed for a
comprehensive immigration reform, Ronald Reagan and George W.
Bush, both Republicans.  HUNT: Right. Right.  BARBOUR: I -- when I was thinking about running for
president -- talked about immigration reform. If we will follow
what’s good economic policy, we will recognize that we are in a
global battle for capital and for labor. We need the labor, not
just H-1B visas for Ph.D.s and engineers from  India , but also we
need agricultural labor.  California , our biggest ag state, they
say 50 percent to 70 percent of the workers who work there are
undocumented. That’s bad for our economy.  Republicans need to be for what’s good for -- what is good
for the economy, and immigration reform is needed for -  HUNT: Would the Bush pathway to citizenship be the way to
go?  BARBOUR: Well, I think this. We’ve got 3 million, 4 million
Latinos who are in this country, many of whom have worked for
years and years and years and years. We don’t need to replace
them. If they’ve got a job, paid their taxes, never committed a
crime, been a good citizen, why would we want to send them home?  HUNT: If they meet those tests, then we ought to come up
with some kind of pathway?  BARBOUR: Then we ought to let them have a -- whether you
call it a guest worker visa or legal status. Now, if they want
to become a citizen, there’s another way -- another process -  HUNT: But we’re not going to send them back.  BARBOUR: Of course we’re not.  HUNT: OK.  BARBOUR: I mean, even if you want to, you couldn’t send
them back.  HUNT: Haley, let me ask you this.  Newt Gingrich  said the
other day that Republicans have to start to reconsider their
views on marriage equality. Should the party now disavow their
opposition to gay marriage?  BARBOUR: No, of course not. Look, in the two-party system,
both parties are necessarily coalitions.  HUNT: Right.  BARBOUR: Abortion has been the issue most of my career that
sort of this is settled on. Well, about 40 percent of
Republicans are pro-choice, and about 40 percent of Democrats
are pro-choice -- I mean, are pro-life. You’ve got a large,
large number of African-Americans who are as pro-life as the
most conservative Republican.  The same thing is true about gay marriage. There are people
in our party who are perfectly comfortable with that, who are
advocates of that. There are gay people in the  Republican Party .  HUNT: But -  BARBOUR: And they’re just as good a Republican as I am.  HUNT: You know, Haley, the difference is, abortion views
don’t change. Young people have the same views as the elderly.
With gay marriage, young people overwhelmingly support it. It
seems that the trends of history, which are unchanged on
abortion, are against that position on gay marriage.  BARBOUR: I’m not -- I’m going to take your word for what
you said about abortion. I’m not sure that I would have thought
that. But there’s no question that every generation of Americans
is more tolerant. And the biggest thing for me about Republicans
is, you know, I am pro-life. You know, I believe that marriage
is an institution, a union between one man and one woman. And I
believe other people have every right in the world to have a
different opinion, and they’re just as good of people and just
as good of Republicans as I am.  HUNT: Right.  BARBOUR: You don’t have to agree with Haley Barbour on
everything -  HUNT: So you need to be more tolerant or inclusive of
people with different views on those sort of issues?  BARBOUR: And every other sort of issue. You know, my old
boss man,  Ronald Reagan , used to say, remember, a fellow who
agrees with you 80 percent of the time is your friend and ally,
he’s not some 20 percent traitor.  HUNT: Exactly. How about women? You lost it by 11, 12
points each of the last two elections. What should Republicans
do to alter that trend?  BARBOUR: Isn’t it interesting that Republicans lost women,
but we carried married women, carried white women by like 14
points? And so I think it would be a mistake to just focus this
problem on women, because there are a lot of minorities that
these women were affected more by the perception that we were
not welcoming to Hispanics.  What we’ve got to do is, A, be for what we think’s good
policy that -- particularly for economic growth and  job
creation . And then we need to go and sell that to tell people,
here’s what we’re for, here’s why we’re for it, here’s why we
think it’ll help you and your community and your hometown. And
we want you. When Mitt Romney said that Hispanics should self-
deport -  HUNT: It made it hard to win the Latino vote in the fall,
didn’t it?  BARBOUR: How do you vote for somebody who wants to make
your grandmamma leave?  HUNT: Let me ask you this. On the question of there are
some Republican state legislators,  Virginia ,  Michigan ,
 Pennsylvania ,  Wisconsin , who want to change the ground rules,
they want to change the system so you elect presidents by
congressional districts, the way a couple small states do now.
Is that a bad idea?  BARBOUR: I don’t think it’s a good idea. First of all, I
don’t think anybody can predict with any form of precision who
it’ll help from this election to the next.  HUNT: That can change.  BARBOUR: But I would note two things about this. This broke
into the news as if this was about to happen. And then today,
the chairman of the committee in the Virginia legislature said
it isn’t going to get out of committee. And apparently Governor
McDonnell is going to announce today -- and I hate to predict --
but it is said that he’s going to say he’s not for it.  HUNT: Haley Barbour, thank you so much for being with us
today.  BARBOUR: Thanks, Al.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
