to buy the stakes in Brazil’s  Oi SA (OIBR4)  owned by the Jereissati and
Andrade families for 2 billion reais ($985 million),  Veja
reported , without saying how it got the information.  Carlos Jereissati and Sergio Andrade are negotiating the
sale of the stakes of 19.35 percent each, the Sao Paulo-based
magazine said in its Radar column. Grupo BTG Pactual is serving
as an adviser, Veja said.  Oi declined to comment, a press official told Bloomberg
