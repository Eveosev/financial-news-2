World Bank (BOWEMBA)  President Jim Yong Kim
urged governments to help establish a global carbon market as
the effects of  climate change  threaten the world’s poor
countries.  In a November report the World Bank said that the earth
risks “cataclysmic changes” caused by extreme heat waves,
rising seas and depleted food stocks as it heads toward global
warming of 4 degrees Celsius this century.  “I would like to see governments get behind a carbon
market,” Kim said in an interview with  Simon Kennedy  of 
Bloomberg News in Davos, Switzerland. “People are starting to 
connect the dots. These extreme weather events are related to 
climate change and we need to act.”  He said the poor will suffer the most from climate change
as the effects of child malnutrition last for a lifetime. Low-and middle-income countries will need help to remove energy
subsidies, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
