New York Yankees’ third baseman  Alex Rodriguez , who underwent hip surgery 10 days ago, may miss the
2013 Major League Baseball season, General Manager Brian Cashman
said.  The 37-year-old had surgery on his left hip Jan. 16 and
initially was expected to miss six months.  The serious nature of the surgery and the condition from
which Rodriguez is trying to recover makes it possible that he
won’t be back for the season, Cashman said yesterday on WFAN
radio.  Rodriguez hit .272 with 18 home runs and 57 runs batted in
during the regular season last year. He was 3-for-25 in
postseason play with 12 strikeouts against right-handed pitchers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
