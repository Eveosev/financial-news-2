Kabel Deutschland  Holding AG,
 Germany â€™s largest cable operator, said it appointed  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  ING Groep
NV (INGA)  to help refinance its so-called payment-in-kind loans.  A bank meeting has been scheduled for June 9 in London, the
Unterfoehring, Germany-based company said in a statement.  Kabel Deutschland said March 31 it plans to prepay 200
million euros ($292 million) of its PIK loans maturing in 2014.
After the prepayment, the company will have about 532 million
euros of PIK loans outstanding, it said.  PIK notes allow borrowers to pay interest with more debt
instead of cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
