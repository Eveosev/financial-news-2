Ukraine may lose as much as 30
percent of its spring wheat and barley in some regions should a
lack of rain be exacerbated by dry, hot winds this week, the
country’s  Hydrometeorology Center  said.  The losses may be between 20 percent and 30 percent in some
parts of the central Kiev, Kirovohrad and Cherkasy regions and
the northern Chernihiv region if the winds last three days,
Tetiana Adamenko, head of the agricultural department at the
Kiev-based center, said today by phone.  “One can talk about drought for early spring grains,”
Adamenko said. “Their condition is worsening.” Corn and
sunflowers, which were planted later, won’t be affected, she
said.  Should hot winds aggravate the drying of grain heads and
soil, Ukraine may see its winter grains harvest reduced by as
much as 10 percent from a May 27 forecast of 23.5 million metric
tons, Adamenko said. The center lowered its overall grain
harvest forecast last month to 42 million to 43 million tons
from 43 million to 44 million tons, according to the
meteorologist.  “Good rains” are expected to fall everywhere in Ukraine
starting from June 12, Adamenko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
