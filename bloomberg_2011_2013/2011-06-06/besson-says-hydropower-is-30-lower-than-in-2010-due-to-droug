French Industry Minister Eric Besson
said hydrolelectric power production is 30 percent lower so far
this year than in 2010 due to dry weather conditions.  Electricite de  France  SA has carried out maintenance on 14
seaside reactors and they can be “fully operational” in the
coming months should riverside plants have to lower output due
to the drought, the minister said on LCI television.  Besson also called for a meeting of European energy
ministers to discuss consequences of national energy policies
following  Germany ’s decision to phase out nuclear power. France
has become a net exporter of electricity to that country
following the shutdown of reactors there, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
