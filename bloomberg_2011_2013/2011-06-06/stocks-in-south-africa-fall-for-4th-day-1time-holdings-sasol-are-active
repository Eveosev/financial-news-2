The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
snapped a three-day losing streak, rising 2.38, or less than 0.1
percent, to 31,578.03 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the diversified mining company

index, snapped three days of losses, gaining 3.42 rand, or 1.1
percent, to 328.01 rand. Copper rose for a third day in  New York

short of demand.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, (CFR SJ), the maker of luxury
watches, fell for a fourth day, losing 47 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to 43.50 rand. The company’s Piaget brand plans to raise prices
in July to help gradually offset higher costs from the strength
of the Swiss franc, Piaget Chief Executive Officer Philippe
