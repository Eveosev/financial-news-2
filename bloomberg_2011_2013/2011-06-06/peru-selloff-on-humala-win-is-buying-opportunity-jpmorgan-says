Peru ’s financial assets may offer a
buying opportunity if markets tumble after a victory by Ollanta
Humala in presidential elections, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  Humala, the former army rebel who advocates greater state
control of the country’s natural resources, claimed victory
after initial results showed he won more votes than
Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori. Local investors expect markets to
retreat if Humala wins, Ben Ramsey, an analyst at JPMorgan in
 New York , wrote in a research note.  “We would see a sharp selloff in Peru as a buying
opportunity,” Ramsey wrote. “Humala would be more moderate
than expected if elected -- if anything because he can ill
afford to see Peru’s growth collapse given his intention to
fight poverty more aggressively.”  Declines in Peruvian assets may be limited because local
pension funds already have “underweight” holdings of bonds,
while global investors have historically low positions in the
country’s local and foreign-currency debt, Ramsey wrote.  “While we acknowledge that local investors in Peru
expected a sharp selloff in the case of a Humala victory and
they are the main drivers of Peruvian assets, we do not believe
that the correction would be so severe,” Ramsey wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
