lender by geographical spread, fell 22 kobo, or 1.5 percent, to
15 naira, extending its drop this year to 4.5 percent. The
company sees loan growth of about 20 percent in 2011 and limited
expansion as it’s “bedding in” earlier growth, Chief Executive
Officer Arnold Ekpe said. “We have become much more
discriminatory,” Ekpe said in an interview in  London  today.
“As you become bigger it is harder to grow.”  National Bank of Kenya Ltd. (NBKL)  , a state-owned
lender, jumped the most since May 31, gaining 25 cents, or 0.7
percent, to 34 shillings after saying it appointed Mohammed
Hassan as its new chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
