India ’s 10-year bonds dropped,
snapping a five-day advance, on speculation the lowest yields in
three weeks deterred investors.  Government notes rose last week for the first time in eight
weeks after a government report showed gross domestic product
increased 7.8 percent in the three months ended March 31 from a
year earlier, the slowest pace in five quarters. Prospects
diesel prices will be raised this week also damped demand, said
 Roy Paul , a deputy general manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai.  “Bonds had rallied too much and investors are probably
reducing their holdings,” said Paul, who is in charge of fixed-
income and currencies.  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.29 percent as of
9:48 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
