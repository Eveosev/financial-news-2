England took two  Sri Lanka  wickets
soon after play resumed following a rain delay on the fourth day
of the second cricket Test.  Mahela Jayawardene was caught by Alastair Cook off  Steven
Finn  for 49 and Thilan Samaraweera was caught by Matt Prior off
Chris Tremlett for nine.  By 2 p.m. local time, 50 minutes after play started, Sri
Lanka was on 400-5 at Lord’s in London, in response to England’s
486 all out. Prasanna Jayawardene had 4 and Farveez Maharoof was
on 2.  Yesterday, fewer than 40 overs were played because of the
weather. Sri Lanka was 372-3 in its first innings at close of
play, with captain  Tillakaratne Dilshan  contributing 193.  England won the rain-shortened first Test by an innings and
14 runs after bowling out Sri Lanka for 82 in its second innings
when a draw appeared most likely.  The teams are scheduled to play three Tests, a Twenty20
match, and five one-day internationals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
