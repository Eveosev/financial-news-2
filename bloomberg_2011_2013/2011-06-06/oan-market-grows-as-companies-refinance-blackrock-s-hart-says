Leland Hart,  money manager  at New
York-based BlackRock Inc., said about two-thirds of the
leveraged loans arranged in the U.S. “of late” has been used
to refinance debt. BlackRock oversees more than $20 billion in
leveraged-finance assets. Hart spoke today in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Fast Forward.”  On the surge in new deals:  “Certainly there was a lull of new deals in the previous
two years, but with the capital markets open and with equities
having risen a lot of companies are sitting on cash and looking
for ways to grow so the amount of M&A activity is picking up.”  On refinancing debt:  “Roughly two-thirds of the activity was refinancing. As
you talked about in the past -- the big refinancing wall -- what
companies have done is refinance a lot of the debt. Two-thirds
of the deals done of late have been refinancing.”  On rising rates:  “In addition, when you think about what happens when rates
rise, that would force the price of the bond down and for loans,
Libor would go up and what you get paid on loans would
increase.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
