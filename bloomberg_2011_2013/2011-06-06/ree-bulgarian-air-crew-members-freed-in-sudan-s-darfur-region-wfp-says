Three Bulgarian helicopter crew
members working for the United Nations  World Food Programme  were
released today in the western Sudanese region of Darfur, WFP
said.  “The three appeared to be in good health,” WFP Regional
Director Amer Daoudi said in an e-mailed statement today. The
three men will stop in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, before
traveling back to  Bulgaria .  The helicopter crew was kidnapped on Jan. 13 at a landing
strip in Um Shalaya, 60 kilometers (37 miles) southeast of El
Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state, according to the
statement.  Bandits and armed groups have targeted UN agencies and
international aid groups who are in Darfur to assist civilians
displaced by the conflict that erupted in 2003 when insurgents
took up arms against the government, accusing it of neglecting
the region.  The conflict has led to the deaths of as many as 300,000
people, mainly due to illness and starvation, and forced about
2.7 million to flee their homes, according to UN estimates. The
Sudanese government has put the death toll at about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
