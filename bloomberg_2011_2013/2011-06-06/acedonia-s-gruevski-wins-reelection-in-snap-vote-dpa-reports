Nikola Gruevski, the prime minister
of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and his VMRO
party won early parliamentary elections held on the weekend,
DPA reported, citing the State Election Commission.  The VMRO-led coalition won 39.3 percent of the votes,
giving it 55 seats in the 123-seat assembly, less than the 63
seats it controlled after the 2008 regular general elections,
DPA said. Some 63.4 percent of the 1.8 million people eligible
to vote cast a ballot, according to DPA.  Gruevski’s junior coalition partner, the Democratic Union
for Integration, which is composed of ethnic Albanians and is
led by former rebel chief Ali Ahmeti, won 10 percent, or
between 15 and 17 seats in Parliament, according to DPA.  The opposition Social Democratic Union, known as SDSM,
won 33 percent and will have 43 lawmakers in parliament, an
increase from 27 seats the party controlled after the 2008
elections, DPA said.  A dispute with  Greece  over Macedonia’s name has blocked
the country’s  European Union  membership talks and prevented it
from joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Greece
objects to the use of the name of Macedonia because it may
imply territorial claims to Greece’s northern province by the
same name. Macedonia became an EU candidate state in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
