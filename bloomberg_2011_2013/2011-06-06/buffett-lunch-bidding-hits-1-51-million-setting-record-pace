Warren Buffett’s lunch auction to
benefit a  San Francisco  charity has drawn a top offer of $2
million with four days of bidding remaining, putting the annual
frundraiser ahead of last year’s pace.  The weeklong auction  on  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , which began yesterday,
has generated bids from at least two potential donors as of 9:57
a.m. in San Francisco, according to the website. Last year,
bidding reached $400,100 on the third day and set a record of
$2.63 million in the final hours. This year’s auction closes
June 10.  Buffett, the 80-year-old investor who is chairman and chief
executive officer of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , has raised more
than $8 million over the past decade for the  San Francisco-based
Glide Foundation , which serves meals to the needy. Buffett’s
first wife Susan, who died in 2004, had volunteered with the
organization.  Buffett’s “generosity, and that of the winning bidders, has
provided meals, health care, job training, rehabilitation and
housing support to help lift people out of these hard times,”
Reverend Cecil Williams, Glide’s founder, said in a statement.  The auction winner gets lunch for eight with Buffett in New
York at Smith & Wollensky, the steakhouse. Buffett, who’s
revered by other investors, turned Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a $190 billion seller
of bricks, power and hurricane insurance.  Glide Lunch With  Warren Buffett  Results:  Year  Winner                                        Winning Bid
