Chile ’s peso fell on speculation the
victory of Ollanta Humala in Peru’s presidential election will
lead to slower economic growth in the neighboring country, and a
global fall in equities cut demand for emerging-market assets.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 468.45 per  U.S. dollar  at 3:44
p.m. New York time, from 467.85 on June 3.  Humala, a former army rebel and a one-time ally of
Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez , claimed victory in the runoff
yesterday against Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori, sparking concern
that he will seek greater state control of the economy. U.S.
stocks retreated for a fourth day as banks led losses amid
concern that economic growth is slowing.  “The neighborhood is becoming a bit more complicated with
Humala, so returning to the 460 level will be difficult,” Raul Lopez, head of  currency trading  at Banco Penta in Santiago, said
in a phone interview. “The peso-dollar ratio could explode up
to 480 if there is any more bad news.”  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 468.91 pesos per
U.S. dollar for $50 million as part of a $12 billion effort to
limit the peso’s gains, it wrote today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
