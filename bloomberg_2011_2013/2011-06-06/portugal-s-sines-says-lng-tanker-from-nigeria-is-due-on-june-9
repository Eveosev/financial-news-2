Portugal’s port of Sines said a
liquefied natural gas tanker sailing from Bonny,  Nigeria , is due
to arrive on June 24.  The cargo being carried by the LNG Ogun was not specified
on the website of  Administracao do Porto de Sines SA , the port’s
management company.  The Sines LNG terminal, with a capacity of 5.26 billion
cubic meters of natural gas a year, is managed by REN-Redes
Energeticas Nacionais SA, the nation’s power and gas grid
operator. LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for shipment by
tanker and then converted back to a gas at terminals for
distribution to users.  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , Portugal’s biggest oil and gas
company, receives LNG at Sines as well as gas from Algeria
through a pipeline crossing Morocco and  Spain . Galp also
operates Portugal’s largest refinery at Sines. EDP-Energias de
Portugal SA, the country’s biggest power utility, runs a coal-
fired electricity plant at the site.  Other ships expected at Sines include Hermione, a tanker
carrying crude that’s sailing from Malabo in  Equatorial Guinea 
and is scheduled to arrive on June 25. Sines is one of the
European Union’s biggest deepwater harbors, according to the
port’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
