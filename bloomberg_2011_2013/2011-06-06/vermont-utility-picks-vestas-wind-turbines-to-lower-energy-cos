Green Mountain  Power Corp., a Vermont
utility, will use turbines from Vestas Wind Systems A/S for a
63-megawatt wind farm.  Green Mountain will install Vestas’ V112 model 3-megawatt
turbines at its Kingdom Community Wind project in Lowell, the
Colchester, Vermont-based utility said today in a statement.
That will lower the project’s levelized cost of energy to 9.2
cents a kilowatt-hour, from a projected 10.3 cents that it would
have achieved with other turbines it had considered.  The Kingdom Community project is expected to generate
enough power for 24,000 homes, and construction is set to begin
in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
