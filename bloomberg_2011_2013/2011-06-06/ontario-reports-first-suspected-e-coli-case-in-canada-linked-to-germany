An Ontario man who returned from a
holiday in  Germany  may be  Canada ’s first case of E. coli linked
to the European outbreak, according to Ontario’s health
ministry.  “We do have a suspected case in Ontario that’s related to
the E. coli outbreak in Germany,” Andrew Morrison, spokesman
for the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, said today in an
interview. It would be the first case in Ontario and probably
the first in Canada, he said.  The man, who lives in the Peel region near Toronto, is
believed to have picked up the toxin during a holiday to Germany
this spring, where he ate the local food.  The ministry is doing testing to confirm that the E. coli
case is linked to that in  Europe , which has become the world’s
deadliest outbreak of the infection. The man has been released
from hospital.  “We’re expecting full confirmation on his case perhaps
later this week or early next,” Morrison said. “We’re just
monitoring him closely to make sure that he’s ok, but other than
that there are no other complications.”  At least 22 people have died and 2,333 people have fallen
ill in the latest outbreak, according to the  European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control .  To contact the reporter on this story:
