Kenya ’s shilling depreciated and
headed for an almost three-week low against the dollar as the
central bank said it expects inflation to rise beyond a 25-month
high this year.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened 0.1
percent to 86.90 per dollar by 2:19 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi. A close of this level will be the weakest since May 18.
The shilling is the third-worst performer against the dollar
worldwide this year after Suriname’s dollar and Maldives’
rufiyaa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kenya’s inflation rate may rise above the 13 percent
recorded in May as dry weather curbs agricultural production and
threats of potential food shortages impact on the balance of
payments position, Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “The expectation of higher inflation will put the shilling
under pressure in the coming days,” Jeremiah Kendagor head of
trading at Nairobi-based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a
phone interview today.  Kenya’s central bank on May 31 raised the benchmark
interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 6.25 percent and
lifted the  cash reserve ratio  for banks, changing its focus to
taming inflation from spurring economic growth.  “Threats from potential food shortages were likely to
impact negatively on the balance of payments position and
inflation later in the year,” Ndung’u said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
