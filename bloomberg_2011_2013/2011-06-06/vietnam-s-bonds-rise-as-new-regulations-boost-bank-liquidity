Vietnam ’s benchmark bonds rose as
improved liquidity boosted banks’ demand for the government debt.
The dong declined.  Bank deposits increased 1.40 percent this year through May
19, the  State Bank  of Vietnam said in a statement on its website
today. The central bank lowered the cap for dollar-deposits for
individuals to 2 percent from 3 percent, and cut the limit for
institutions to 0.5 percent from 1 percent, from June 1. The
move has resulted in people switching to dong deposits, which
have interest rates of about 14 percent, said Vu Anh Duc, a
fixed-income dealer at Vietnam Bank for Industry and Trade.  “Banks have more funds after some recent moves by the
central bank,” Hanoi-based Duc said.  The yield on the benchmark five-year notes dropped four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 12.83 percent,
according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,570 per dollar as
of 5:01 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the dong’s daily reference rate at
20,628, compared with 20,633 at the end of last week. The
currency is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on
either side of the fixing.  The monetary authority said Vietnam’s money supply rose
1.57 percent this year through May 19, in its statement today.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
