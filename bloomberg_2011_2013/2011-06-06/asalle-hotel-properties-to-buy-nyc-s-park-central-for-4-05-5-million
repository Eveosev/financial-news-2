LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO)  said it
agreed to buy the Park Central Hotel in midtown  Manhattan  for
$405.5 million.  The company plans to fund the purchase with a mortgage and
about $216.6 million raised in a share sale in April, LaSalle
Hotel Properties said in a statement without disclosing the
seller. The transaction is expected to be completed toward the
end of the third quarter.  The 83-year-old hotel, located near  Carnegie Hall  on
Seventh Avenue between West 55th and West 56th streets, is
expected to undergo a renovation next year that will cost $30
million to $35 million and include guest rooms and bathrooms,
corridors and the lobby.  “We are excited about the acquisition of the Park Central
Hotel and the opportunity to further invest in  New York City ,”
Michael D. Barnello, president and chief executive officer of
LaSalle Hotel Properties, said in the statement.  The 934-room hotel has a steakhouse and a lobby lounge that
serves drinks and light fare. It has 14,000 square feet (1,300
square meters) of meeting and function space, and an 8,500-
square-foot grand ballroom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
