United Grain Co. ,  Russia ’s state
grain trader, wants to invest in a grain terminal at the
southern port of Taman that is now being designed, United Grain
spokesman Viktor Krupenin said.  The terminal would be capable of handling 8 million metric
tons of grain a year, Krupenin said by text message yesterday.
The terminal is expected to open by 2017, he said.  Russia’s Federal State Enterprise Rosmorport, part of the
Transport and Property Ministries, picked LenmorNIIproekt to
design the port on March 21, said Rosmorport spokeswoman Irina
Lobkova. The port will cost an estimated 82.7 billion rubles
($2.98 billion), including 32.1 billion from private industry
and 50.6 billion rubles from the government, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
