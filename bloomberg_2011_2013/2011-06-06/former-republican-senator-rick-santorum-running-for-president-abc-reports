Former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum of
 Pennsylvania  said today he’s seeking the Republican presidential
nomination and said he’s “in it to win,”  ABC News  reported.  “We are ready to announce that we are going to be in this
race,” Santorum said in an interview with ABC. He is scheduled
to make a formal announcement later today in Pennsylvania.  Santorum, 53, served from 1995 to 2007 in the  U.S. Senate 
and was defeated in his bid for a third term by Democrat Bob Casey. He was one of the most outspoken opponents of abortion
while serving in Congress. He began raising money for a possible
presidential candidacy in April.  Santorum is a former chairman of the Senate Republican
Conference. Prior to his election to the Senate in 1994, he
served two two-year terms in the U.S. House.  To contact the reporter on this story:
