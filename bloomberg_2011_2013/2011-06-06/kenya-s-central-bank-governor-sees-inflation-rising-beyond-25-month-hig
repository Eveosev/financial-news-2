Kenya ’s inflation rate, which jumped
to a 25-month high in May, is expected to rise further this year
as dry weather curbs agricultural production, central bank
Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said.  “Threats from potential food shortages were likely to
impact negatively on the balance of payments position and
inflation later in the year,” Ndung’u, said in an e-mailed
statement today from Nairobi, the capital. Price pressures are
unlikely to slow the economy’s expansion, with growth projected
to “remain strong” this year, he said.  Kenya’s central bank on May 31 raised its benchmark lending
rate for the second time this year to 6.25 percent and lifted
the minimum reserve requirement for banks, changing its focus to
taming inflation from spurring economic growth. The increases
follow eight reductions in the key lending rate between December
2008 and January 2011.  Higher food and fuel costs pushed inflation in East
 Africa ’s biggest economy to 13 percent in May, almost triple the
5 percent target. Rising price pressures reinforced expectations
of increased borrowing costs. Kenya’s 91-day Treasury bill yield
climbed to 8.798 percent on June 2, a nine-year high, on
speculation that inflation may erode returns, Kennedy Butiko,
deputy head of treasury at Bank of Africa, said on June 3.  Kenya will lift expenditure on infrastructure by 35 percent
to 221 billion shillings ($2.54 billion) in 2011-12 from a year
earlier, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said on June 2.
Spending in the budget for the fiscal year through June 2012
will grow 16 percent to 1.16 trillion shillings from a year
earlier, providing room for government debt yields to increase
further.  The  International Monetary Fund  last month cut its 2011
growth forecast for Kenya, citing the impact on agriculture from
poor rainfall, to between 5 percent and 5.4 percent, from an
earlier projection of 5.7 percent. The  World Bank  has reduced
its forecast to 4.8 percent from 5.3 percent.  Kenya’s economy grew 5.6 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
