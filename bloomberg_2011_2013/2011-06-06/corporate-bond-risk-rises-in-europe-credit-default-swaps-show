The cost of insuring corporate debt
rose in  Europe , according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 40 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 5 basis points to
389.6 as of 9:52 a.m. in London, the highest since March 18. The
Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 investment-grade companies
rose 0.3 basis point to 103.8. An increase signals a
deterioration in investor perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased 2.5 basis points to 189.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
