Burundi’s economy will probably
expand about 4.2 percent this year after growing 3.9 percent in
2010, the International Monetary Fund said.  The East African nation is making good progress in
implementing structural reform, including budget management and
in adopting a financial industry strategy, the Washington-based
institution said in an e-mailed statement today.  Inflation is expected to accelerate this year and the
government needs new policies to deal with rising food and fuel
costs, the IMF said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
