JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said it hired
 Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s Michal Szwarc to head the company’s
investment-banking unit in Poland.  Szwarc, 38, who had worked at Credit Suisse since 1999,
will take up the post in Warsaw on Sept. 15, JPMorgan said today
in a statement.  New York-based JPMorgan seeks to expand in Poland as it
expects “further privatization, an increase of activity among
Polish clients as well as expansion of big Polish companies
abroad,” Walter Schuster, head of the bank’s central and
eastern European operations, said in the statement.  Investment banks including JPMorgan, Credit Suisse and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expanded equity coverage in Poland last
year as share sales reached a record $10 billion and trading
volumes increased. The  Warsaw Stock Exchange  has been the
fastest-growing market in central  Europe  in the past 10 years,
more than doubling the number of traded companies and almost
tripling daily turnover, according to its website.  In April, a brokerage of Poland’s largest bank PKO Bank
Polski SA hired Citigroup Inc.’s Wlodzimierz Giller, Erste Group
Bank AG’s Artur Iwanski and ING Groep NV’s Stanislaw Ozga as
equity analysts, doubling its research team.  Goldman Sachs, which has three people in its Warsaw office,
also plans to add analysts to create a local research team, the
bank said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
