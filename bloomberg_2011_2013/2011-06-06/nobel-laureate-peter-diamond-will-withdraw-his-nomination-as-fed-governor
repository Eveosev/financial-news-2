Nobel laureate  Peter Diamond , one of
President Barack Obama’s nominees to serve on the  Federal
Reserve ’s board of governors, will withdraw his nomination in
the face of opposition from Republicans on the Senate Banking
Committee.  “The Republicans on the committee voted in lockstep
against my appointment, making it extremely unlikely that the
opposition to a full Senate vote can be overcome,” Diamond said
today in an opinion article on the New York Times website. “It
is time for me to withdraw, as I plan to inform the White
House,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
