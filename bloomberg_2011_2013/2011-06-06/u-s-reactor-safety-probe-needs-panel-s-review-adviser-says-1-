A report next month on U.S. nuclear
power-plant safety, triggered by a reactor crisis in  Japan ,
should be examined by an independent Nuclear Regulatory
Commission committee, the panel’s chairman said.  The  U.S. Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards  wants to
“review the near-term report,” Said Abdel-Khalik, the panel’s
chairman, said today at a meeting in Rockville,  Maryland . The
committee provides guidance to the NRC, which oversees the
nation’s 104 commercial reactors.  The safety of U.S. reactors is being examined by regulators
and lawmakers following the partial meltdown of a nuclear plant
in Japan. A magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on March 11
crippled Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant
with fires, explosions and radiation leaks in the worst nuclear
incident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.  The NRC started a 90-day review of U.S. reactor safety
after the Japanese disaster. An interim report is due next
month, NRC Commissioner William Ostendorff said May 25 at a
hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.  The NRC has asked the advisory committee to examine results
of a “longer-term review” of U.S. reactor safety that will
follow the 90-day probe, Abdel-Khalik said. The committee also
wants to study next month’s report from the NRC  task force  in
charge of the post-Fukushima review, he said.  “It is our hope that the task force will facilitate that
review,” Abdel-Khalik said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
