Helios Europe, Shepherd Developments
and  Segro Plc (SGRO)  have signed an agreement to build the U.K.’s
largest inland port and logistics parks near Doncaster, the
Financial Times reported, citing Helios Europe Chief Executive
Officer Mike Hughes.  The developers, who will begin working on the 400 million-
pound ($657 million) Rossington Inland Port next year, have held
talks with  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  to run the rail cargo
operation, the newspaper said. The project will employ about
5,000 workers, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
