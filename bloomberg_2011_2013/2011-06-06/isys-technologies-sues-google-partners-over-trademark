ISYS Technologies Inc., which manages
intellectual property patents, said it sued  Google Inc. (GOOG)  claiming
that the Web search company’s Chrome operating system violates
the trademarks for ISYS’s Chromium Modular Computer.  ISYS said today in a statement that it seeks to stop Google
and its marketing partners  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , Best Buy Co.,
Samsung Electronics Co. and  Acer Inc. (2353)  from selling Chrome
products “on or about June 15.”  ISYS said it holds patents for the Xi3 modular computer
and filed a trademark registration for ChromiumPC with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office last June. Google, based in  Mountain
View , California, has opposed the granting of the trademark,
according to Salt Lake City-based ISYS.  Google’s operating system is based on its Chrome Web
browser. The company is marketing a laptop, the Cr-48, which is
the first computer to run the Chrome operating system.  Aaron Zamost, a Google spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
