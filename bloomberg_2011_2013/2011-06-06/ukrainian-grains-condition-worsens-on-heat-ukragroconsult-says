Ukrainian grains’ condition worsened
because of higher temperatures in May’s last 10 days and this
month, UkrAgroConsult said.  Soils dried up in many areas, the Kiev-based researcher
said today by e-mail. Maximum air temperatures reached 28
degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit) to 32 degrees Celsius
and relative humidity fell to 30 percent or less across most of
the country, it said.  Rapeseed may suffer from dry weather, the researcher said.
UkrAgroConsult reduced its estimate for the harvest of the
oilseed to 1.59 million metric tons from the month-earlier 1.64
million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
