Avianca Taca Holding SA, owner of
 Colombia ’s biggest airline by sales, is in talks on ordering
between 50 and 100 single-aisle planes as South America’s
economic growth spurs travel.  The carrier is considering Airbus SAS’s A320neo, as well as
 Boeing Co. (BA)  and Bombardier Inc. planes, German Efromovich, whose
company took over Avianca in 2004, said in an interview
yesterday in Singapore. It plans to make a decision by year-end,
he said.  Avianca, which raised $260 million in an initial share sale
last month, has been adding new Airbus planes at a rate of more
than one a month under an existing order that runs through 2014.
International  air travel  in  Latin America  rose 17.5 percent in
the first four months of the year, the fastest growth rate
worldwide, according to the  International Air Transport
Association .  The carrier is interested to see whether Boeing will offer
an all-new single-aisle plane to compete with the A320neo, a
revamped version of Airbus’s existing offering that features new
engines.  “From Boeing we want to see a more efficient, more modern
aircraft,” Efromovich said. “If that takes new engines, or
composites, or whatever, we don’t care -- whatever they’re going
to offer we’ll compare it with the neos.”  The airline is also talking to Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp.
about regional planes that could replace older Fokker planes,
Efromovich said.  Avianca Taca is part of a venture formed last year by
Aerovias del Continente Americano SA, Colombia’s biggest
airline, and San Salvador-based Taca Airlines. The two carriers
together serve more than 100 destinations and hold about 50
percent of air routes in Latin America.  Avianca and Taca’s combined fleet as of January included 54
A320-series planes, two Boeing 767 widebodies, five Airbus A330
widebody planes, two McDonnell Douglas 83, 15 Fokker 100s, 10
Fokker 50s and eight  Embraer SA (ERJ)  planes. The airline also has
Airbus A350s and Boeing 787s on order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
