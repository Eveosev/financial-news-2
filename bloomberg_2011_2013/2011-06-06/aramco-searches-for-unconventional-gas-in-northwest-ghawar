Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest
crude exporter, is looking for so-called unconventional gas in
the northwest and in the area of the Ghawar field, where gas
infrastructure exists, Aramco said in its 2010 annual review.  Aramco seeks to develop resources in shale rock and tight
gas, trapped in impermeable sandstone, to reduce the burning of
valuable crude for power generation.  The company plans to initially recover about 300 million
cubic feet a day of gas, rising to 5 billion cubic feet, Brian
Gratto, manager for exploration resource assessment at the Saudi
Aramco, said in an interview on May 17.  Amin Nasser, Saudi Aramco’s senior vice president for
upstream, said May 15 that his company is venturing into
developing tight gas. Aramco is now seeking the help of
international partners in order to develop its tight-gas
resources, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
