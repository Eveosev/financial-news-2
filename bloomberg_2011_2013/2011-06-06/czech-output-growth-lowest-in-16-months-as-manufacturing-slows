Czech industrial output growth was
the slowest in 16 months in April as manufacturing expansion
weakened.  Overall production increased an annual 4.7 percent, the
weakest reading since December 2009, compared with a revised 9.2
percent growth rate in March, the statistics office in  Prague 
said on its website today. The median forecast of 14 economists
in a Bloomberg survey was for an 8 percent advance in April.  Czech industrial output is driving the countryâ€™s recovery
from its worst economic recession since the fall of communism
two decades ago, with exports including Skoda Auto AS cars and
auto parts heading mainly to  Germany  and other the euro-area
countries. Manufacturing production rose 6.1 percent in April,
after an 11.6 percent increase in the previous month.  Construction output fell 6 percent in April, compared with
a revised 5.8 percent jump in March, the statistics office said
in a separate statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
