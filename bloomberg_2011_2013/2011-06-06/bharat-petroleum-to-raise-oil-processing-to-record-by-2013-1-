Bharat Petroleum  Corp., India’s
second-largest state refiner, will raise oil processing to a
record 30 million metric tons in the year ending March 2013 to
meet demand in the world’s second-fastest growing major economy.  The Mumbai-based company will increase refining to 28
million tons in the year ending March 31, 2012, from 25 million
tons a year earlier, Chairman R.K. Singh told reporters at the
Asia Oil and Gas Conference in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  Refiners in India, the world’s fourth-biggest oil consumer,
are investing in new capacity amid a boom in energy use. The
 International Energy Agency  estimates the South Asian nation’s
energy consumption will more than double to 833 million tons of
oil equivalent by 2030. Fuel demand in  India  may rise between 5
percent and 7 percent annually in the next decade, Singh said on
Nov. 25.  Bharat Petroleum plans to spend about $4.5 billion to
expand its capacity, Finance Director S.K. Joshi said Sept. 24.
The company may boost the capacity of its newly constructed 6
million ton-a-year Bina refinery in central India and its Kochi
plant in the country’s south, Chairman Singh said Nov. 25. The
Kochi and Bina refineries can be expanded to 15 million tons
each, he said.  Gross refining margins may climb as high as $7 a barrel in
the year ending March 31 as the spread between crude and oil
products stays near $18 and $20 a barrel, Singh said today.
Margins averaged $4.50 in the previous fiscal year. The company
expects “very good” refining margins in the next two years.
Processing profit in the three months ending June 30 may stay
near the previous quarter’s $7.90 a barrel, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
