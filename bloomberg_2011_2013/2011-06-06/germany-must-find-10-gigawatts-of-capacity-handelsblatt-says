Germany  will have to generate as much
as 10 gigawatts of energy capacity from alternative sources to
make up the shortfall from its accelerated exit from nuclear
power by 2022, Handelsblatt newspaper reported, citing draft
legislation.  The figure comes from a 39-point energy concept that
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet plans to approve today, the
newspaper said. The shortfall will be made up by gas-fired  power
plants , energy from biological sources such as biofuels as well
as wind and solar power.  Merkel’s coalition is considering compensating industrial
energy users with 1.2 billion euros ($1.8 billion) a year from
2013 to help make up for higher energy costs, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
