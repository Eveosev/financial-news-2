Hungary’s ruling coalition may change
the constitution in a parliamentary vote today to cut
retroactively or even take back pensions from early retirees,
state news agency  MTI  reported.  Under proposed legislation, people who haven’t yet reached
the legal retirement age of 62 years may have their pensions
reduced, converted to social benefits or taken away if they are
deemed fit to work, according to MTI.  Parliament may also pass a resolution increasing the number
of  Constitutional Court  judges to 15, perhaps as early as
September, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
