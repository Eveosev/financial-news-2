Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  will offer two
algorithmic trading products for Brazilian stocks as brokerages
expand in  Latin America â€™s biggest equity market.  Deutsche Bank may offer one of the products in other
countries in the region, the company said in a statement today.  Citigroup Inc. began offering algorithmic trading in  Brazil 
in March, following Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last year and UBS
AG and Bank of America Corp. in 2009. Algorithmic, or high-
frequency, trading uses computers to analyze market conditions
to determine how much of a stock or derivative to buy and when.  To contact the reporter on this story:
