Kenya ’s central bank plans to offer
three Treasury bonds with two-, five- and 20-year maturities
this month to raise 18 billion shillings ($207 million), said
Fred Mweni, chairman of the country’s Bond Traders Association.  The offering was decided on at a meeting between central
bank officials and the so-called Market Leaders Forum of
securities traders on June 3, Mweni said in a phone interview
today from Nairobi, the capital. Mweni, who is also managing
director of Tsavo Securities Ltd., didn’t say when the auction
would be held.  The five-year bonds will be a new issue, while the two- and
20-year securities are being reopened, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
