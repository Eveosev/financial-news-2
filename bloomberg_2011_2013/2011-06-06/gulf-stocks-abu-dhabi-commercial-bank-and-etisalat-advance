highest level in more than two years, gaining 2.7 percent to
3.03 dirhams. The shares have surged 11 percent the past seven
trading days. The Star reported on June 1 the United Arab
Emirates’ third-biggest bank may sell its 25 percent stake in
Malaysia’s  RHB Capital Bhd. (RHBC)  for twice the book value. An ADCB
official, who didn’t want to be identified because of company
policy, declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg today.       Emirates Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT UH) climbed the
most since March, rising 1 percent to 10.45 dirhams. The U.A.E.
phone company said it will revisit a plan to seek  Syria ’s third
mobile-phone license if terms are changed. Etisalat will focus
on expanding networks in countries where it operates, including
the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia and Egypt, rather than than on
purchases and new licenses, Chairman Mohammed Omran said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
