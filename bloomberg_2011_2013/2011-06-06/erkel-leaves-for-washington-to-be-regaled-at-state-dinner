Chancellor Angela Merkel  departed
Berlin for Washington, where she’ll hold talks with President
Barack Obama on the Middle East and the global economy and
receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  Merkel, accompanied by five Cabinet members including
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, will have a private dinner
with Obama tonight in the U.S. capital before a full day of
engagements tomorrow. Her trip is the first official state visit
to the U.S. by a German chancellor since  Helmut Kohl  in 1995.  Merkel and Obama plan to discuss the NATO mission in
Afghanistan, where Germany is the third-largest troop
contributor after the U.S. and U.K., as well as issues affecting
the Middle East including Iran and  Libya , according to a White
House statement. They’ll also talk about the world economy as
European leaders struggle to contain the euro-area debt crisis.  Merkel will be accompanied by her husband, Joachim Sauer, a
chemistry professor at Berlin’s Humboldt University.  To contact the reporter on this story:
