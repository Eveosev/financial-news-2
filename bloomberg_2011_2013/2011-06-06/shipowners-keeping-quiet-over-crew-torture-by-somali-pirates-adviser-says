Shipowners are failing to disclose
the scope of Somali pirates’ torture of crews off the East
African country’s coast to avoid alarming seafarers working in
the danger zone, a security adviser said.  “It is not in the interests of the shipping industry to
make information about crew mistreatment generally available
because of the level of mutinies which would take place,”
Andrew Palmer, chief executive officer of Idarat Maritime Ltd.,
which advises owners and governments, said today at a conference
in  London .  The pirates are intensifying the use of torture against
crews on ships seized off east  Africa  to get higher ransom
payments from shipowners more quickly, Louisville, Colorado-
based  One Earth Future Foundation  said June 2. Attacks added
between $7 billion and $12 billion in extra transportation costs
as ships altered course, paid for extra insurance premiums and
employed armed security guards to protect their vessels, One
Earth said in January.  Information about how hostages are treated is closely held
and sometimes classified by the military, according to Kaija
Hurlburt, lead researcher on a One Earth report into the human
cost of piracy released today. A third of the 1,090 crew held
hostage in 2010 were tortured or abused, the foundation said.  There are more than 100,000 seafarers at any one time
preparing for, or transiting through, the Indian Ocean and Gulf
of Aden region where pirates are active, according to Bill Box,
secretary of the industry group Save Our Seafarers.  “Unless we have this part of the piracy picture provided
to the world, we are missing something,” Pottengal Mukundan,
director of the London-based International Maritime Bureau, told
the conference. The event was organized by the Royal Institute
of International Affairs, which is also known as  Chatham House .  To contact the reporter on this story:
