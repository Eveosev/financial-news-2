Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators gained for the first time in five
days as meteorologists forecast higher temperatures in the
northeast that may increase air-conditioner use.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments rose 1.4 percent to 16.5 million
dekatherms (16.1 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in New York
increased 32 percent.  Cooling demand in New York, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh will
be twice normal until at least June 13, while the South is above
normal, according to Belton, Missouri-based forecaster Weather
Derivatives. Power plants use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies.  “The South should remain plenty hot, with widespread
‘above’ to ‘much above’ readings expected to continue. This
includes Texas, where drought conditions have been helping temps
to spike in some locations,” MDA EarthSat Weather of
Gaithersburg, Maryland, said in a note to clients. The high in
Austin,  Texas , today may reach 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37
Celsius), 10 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of
 State College , Pennsylvania.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 2.3 percent to
22.7 million dekatherms after a 16 percent drop yesterday.  Wholesale gas at the Tetco M3 hub in New York, where gas is
delivered to the northeast, rose 1.2 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$4.9017 per million British thermal units on June 3 on the
Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
gained 8.34 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $4.7219 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
