What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 12 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  as rain may improve yields for
crops in parts of Europe,  China  and  India , reducing demand for
U.S. supplies, said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Corn futures are called to open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago on speculation that warm, dry weather in the
U.S. Midwest helped to firm muddy fields for planting and boost
early crop development, Grow said. A doubling of prices in the
past year may slow demand for fuel and animal feed, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
on the CBOT as rains boost yield potential of oilseed crops in
 Europe , China and India, Grow said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open 0.3 cent to 0.4 cent a pound lower, and
soybean-meal futures may open steady to up 50 cents for 2,000
pounds.  -- Bangladesh plans to increase wheat imports by 3.4 percent
next year to meet a shortfall in domestic supplies, according to
the nationâ€™s Directorate General of Food.  To contact the reporter on this story:
