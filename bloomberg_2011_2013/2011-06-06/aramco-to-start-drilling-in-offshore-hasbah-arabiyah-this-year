Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest oil
exporter, plans to start drilling wells in the Hasbah and
Arabiyah offshore non-associated gas fields.  Saudi Aramco said it plans to add 5 billion cubic feet per
day of natural gas to its capacity to meet increasing local
demand. The two offshore fields northeast of Dhahran will add a
combined 2.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas.  Drilling was to begin in the first quarter of 2011 for
Arabiyah and in the second quarter for Hasbah, Aramco said in
its 2010 annual review today. The gas recovered from Hasbah and
Arabiyah will be sent to the onshore Wasit gas plant to be
processed, according to the review.  The company also plans to produce about 1.8 billion cubic
feet per day of raw dry gas from the offshore Karan field when
completed in 2013 to support the company’s master gas system, it
said in the review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
