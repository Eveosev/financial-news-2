Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN)  might buy
 Roth & Rau AG (R8R)  shares in the open market if the cost falls below
what it considers a “fair price,”  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported today, citing Chief Executive Officer Peter Pauli.  Pauli said that if Meyer Burger doesn’t get acceptance for
its 22 euros per share offer by June 22, he may consider buying
shares in the market, the FTD said.  He said he doesn’t expect a counter offer for Roth & Rau
and ruled out raising Meyer Burger’s bid, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
