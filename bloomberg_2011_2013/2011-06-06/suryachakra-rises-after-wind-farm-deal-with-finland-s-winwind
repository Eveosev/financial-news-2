Suryachakra Power Corp., an Indian
developer of biomass  power plants , was poised for its highest
close in more than five weeks after announcing a deal to set up
a 250-megawatt wind farm with Finland’s WinWinD Oy.  Suryachakra was up 8.5 percent at 14.73 rupees as of 12:10
p.m. in Mumbai trading after surging as much as 14.9 percent
earlier. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index declined 0.4
percent.  WinWinD will provide turbines with a one-year warranty and
operate and maintain the project for an additional 10 years,
Hyderabad-based Suryachakra said in a statement to the Bombay
Stock Exchange today.  Espoo-based WinWinD has secured land for the farm in
Dharapuram in  India ’s southern Tamil Nadu state, it said.  WinWinD’s plant in Vengal,  Tamil Nadu  has the capacity to
make 1,000 1-megawatt turbines a year, R. Narayan Kumar, chief
executive officer of the company’s Indian unit, said on April 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
