Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBCUniversal agreed
to buy the 50 percent stake in two Universal Studios theme parks
it doesn’t already own from private-equity firm  Blackstone Group
LP (BX)  for about $1 billion.  The transaction puts the overall value of the Orlando,
Florida parks at about $3.17 billion, Philadelphia-based Comcast
said in a statement today. Blackstone, based in New York, paid
about $275 million for its stake in 2000.  Blackstone set a June 12 deadline for NBCUniversal to buy
its stake, after which the private-equity firm would have 270
days to sell the entire operation. The parks comprise Universal
Studios Florida, Universal’s Islands of Adventure and the
CityWalk dining, retail and entertainment area.  Comcast, the largest U.S. cable TV provider, gained
majority control of NBCUniversal in January from  General
Electric Co. (GE)  by paying $6.5 billion in cash and contributing
$7.25 billion in assets to a joint venture that owns the media
company.  Blackstone, created in 1985 by Stephen Schwarzman and  Peter
G. Peterson , has other entertainment-related  investments  such as
Merlin Entertainment Group, operator of the London Eye, and
SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment.  Private-equity firms pool money from investors to buy
companies and then typically spend a number of years seeking to
boost sales and cut costs to sell them later at a profit. The
sale price would give Blackstone and its backers a return in
excess of three times its original investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
