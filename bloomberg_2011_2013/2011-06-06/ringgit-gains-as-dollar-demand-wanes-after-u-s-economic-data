Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened for a
second day as demand for the dollar waned on signs that the
recovery in the world’s largest economy is slowing.  The local currency traded stronger than 3 per  U.S. dollar 
for the first time in almost a month after official data on June
3 showed the  unemployment rate  in the U.S. climbed unexpectedly
in May and payrolls expanded at the slowest pace in eight months.
The Dollar Index in  New York  dropped the most last week since
April after Moody’s Investors Service said it may place the
U.S.’s Aaa rating under review should the nation not make
progress in addressing its debt ceiling by mid-July.  “Investors are cutting their positions in the dollar
because of the weak non-farm payrolls and unemployment data,”
said Ahmad Fuad Mohd. Yatim, head of foreign exchange at Kuwait
Finance House (M) Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The Moody’s report of
a possible downgrade of the U.S. credit rating also didn’t
help.”  The ringgit appreciated 0.2 percent to 3.0045 per dollar as
of 4:52 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , off from the intraday high of
2.9948 according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. unemployment rate climbed to 9.1 percent in May
from 9 percent the previous month, while payrolls expanded by
54,000, less than the 165,000 median forecast by economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Malaysian  government bonds  were little changed ahead of the
treasury’s announcement later this week on a sale of 10-year
notes, according to the central bank’s website.  The yield on the 4.16 percent securities due July 2021 fell
1 basis point, or 0.01 of a percentage point, to 4.03 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
