American Airlines parent  AMR Corp. (AMR)  is
close to an agreement on regional flying that would be provided
by American Eagle as a stand-alone carrier, Eagle’s pilot union
said.  The Air Line Pilots Association at Eagle also said it’s
told AMR about concerns that the smaller airline won’t be able
to employ enough pilots for the proposed business plan,
according to a member update posted on the union’s website.  AMR, based in  Fort Worth ,  Texas , has been studying for
almost a year whether to separate American Eagle through a
spinoff, public offering of stock, or a sale. AMR wants Eagle to
compete for the business of ferrying passengers from smaller
cities to hub airports operated by American, the third-biggest
U.S. carrier.  “It is our understanding that management is nearing
completion in their negotiations over a potential air-services
agreement between Eagle and AMR, and we expect to be briefed on
AMR’s version of this document next week,” the notice said.  The message didn’t provide specifics about why union
leaders were concerned about pilot staffing at Eagle.  Dan Garton, Eagle chief executive officer, told employees
last month that a decision to divest Eagle may be the best
option for the airline’s future success.  Eagle’s traffic, or miles flown by paying passengers, rose
17 percent in May from a year earlier, the carrier said today in
a statement. Traffic climbed 16 percent for the year through
May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
