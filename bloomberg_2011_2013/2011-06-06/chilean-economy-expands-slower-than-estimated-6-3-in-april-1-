Chile’s economic activity indicator
rose a less-than-forecast 6.3 percent in April from the previous
year as industry, retail and transportation services expanded,
the central bank said.  The median forecast of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for the Imacec, as the bank’s monthly gross domestic product
proxy is known, to increase 6.9 percent in April, the central
bank said in a statement today. There was one less working day
from April last year, the statement said.  The central bank estimates GDP will expand 5.5 percent to
6.5 percent in 2011, according to its latest monetary policy
report, published April 4. The bank may raise growth estimates
after the economy expanded 9.8 percent in the first quarter,
Cristobal Doberti, chief economist at Bice Inversiones, said in
a June 2 report e-mailed to investors.  “The ingredients of internal demand, especially those
related to private consumption, have shown an evolution that has
been quite favorable,” he said in the report.  Chile’s peso slid 0.1 percent to 468.16 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:01 a.m. New York time from 467.85 on June 3. The currency will
trade at 480 by year-end, according to the median estimate of 58
traders and investors in a May 25 central bank survey.  Breakeven Inflation  Three-month breakeven inflation, which reflects the view of
average price increases, declined to 3.62 percent from 3.65
percent on June 3. One-year breakeven fell to 3.42 percent from
3.43 percent.  Economic growth may decelerate in coming quarters on a
stronger base of comparison and higher benchmark interest rates,
Doberti said.  Retail sales expanded 16 percent in the first quarter and
8.7 percent in April, according to Bloomberg calculations based
on data published by the National Statistics Institute.  The central bank has increased lending costs in 11 of its
past 12 monthly meetings to 5 percent, the fourth-highest
interest rate among major Latin American economies.  Chile’s GDP grew 1.7 percent in the first quarter last
year, when it was recovering from the Feb. 27 earthquake that
caused $30 billion of damage in the $164 billion economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
