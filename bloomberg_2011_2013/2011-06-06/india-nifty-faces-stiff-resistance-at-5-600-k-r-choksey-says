Navneet Daga, a derivatives analyst
with K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt., comments on the
outlook for Indian equities. He spoke by phone from Mumbai.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. rose 0.3 percent to 5,532.05 at the 3:30 p.m. close
in Mumbai. It slid 3.3 percent in May, the most since January.  On Nifty trading range:  “Nifty is likely to continue to move in a narrow range,
between 5400 to 5600 levels, with a positive bias. The bullish
pivot for the market holds at 5,450, the break of which will
resume the larger downtrend. For the June series, maximum open
interest build up in options is seen at strike of 5,800 call and
5,400 put, suggesting downside is limited to near 5,400 levels,
where put-writting activity is significant.”  On Nifty support:  “Markets are showing signs of resilience, holding on to
5,500 levels on closing basis, as there are indications of
cooling in some commodity prices and inflation in the short
term. Overseas fund flows will continue to be lackluster as
macro concerns remain.”  On Nifty resistance:  “Nifty will continue to face stiff resistance at 5,600,
near its 200-day exponential moving average. Implied volatility
on at-the-money options are extremely low, suggesting traders
are pricing very range-bound movement in the coming days.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
