Latvian President Valdis Zatlers, who
lost a re-election bid on June 2, did not rule out participating
in politics after his term expires next month, the  Baltic News
Service  reported.  “I won’t be someone who stands on the sidelines,” Zatlers
said to journalists today in Riga, according to the  newswire.  Zatlers called the country’s first referendum on new
parliamentary elections on May 28 after the legislature failed
to lift the immunity of a parliamentarian who is facing a
criminal probe. The referendum will take place on July 23, and
if successful, will lead to new parliamentary elections two
months later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
