Prada SpA received bids for all the
shares on sale to money managers in its initial public offering
on the first day of order taking, according to three people with
direct knowledge of the transaction.  Prada today began taking orders from institutional
investors, for whom as much as 90 percent of the Italian
company’s share offering has been reserved, according to two of
the people, who declined to be identified because the
information is private. The company will offer stock to
individual investors in  Hong Kong  next week. The IPO is expected
to raise as much as $2.6 billion.  The Milan-based company set a price range of HK$36.50
($4.69) to HK$48 per share, according to a sales document for
the IPO obtained by Bloomberg News. About 16.5 percent of the
company will be publicly traded after the IPO, according to the
terms. The stock is scheduled to start trading on June 24,
according to the term sheet.  A spokesman for Prada in Milan declined to comment.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , Credit Agricole SA’s CLSA Asia-Pacific
Markets unit,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are
managing the IPO, along with Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  -- Editors: Jeff St.Onge, Sara Marley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
