Ukraine’s government raised its
forecast for this year’s trade deficit to $4.936 billion from
$3.398 billion, predicting a faster increase in imports.  Exports will total $84.99 billion, while imports will grow
to $89.93 billion, the government in Kiev said on its website
today. The Cabinet also raised its forecast for producer-price
growth to 17.9 percent from 11.3 percent and left its inflation
estimate unchanged. The economy will probably grow 4.7 percent
rather than 4.5 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
