Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia ’s third-biggest iron ore producer, may exceed its
estimate and spend $10 billion to more than triple output,
Deutsche Bank AG said.  The investment will include mine, port and rail
construction to lift actual production to 146 million metric
tons from the current 40 million tons, Deutsche Bank analysts
Paul Young and Kaan Peker said in a June 3 report. Perth-based
Fortescue said Nov. 19 it plans to almost triple capacity to 155
million metric tons at a cost of $8.4 billion.  Mining companies are facing increasing cost pressures
because of competition for workers and higher expenses for
construction material. Fortescue said June 1 it plans to advance
its expansion schedule by a year to June 2013.  Fortescue’s “management conceded that the $8.4 billion
budget is tight with contractor costs,” Young said after
visiting the Solomon project in  Western Australia . Ore
processing facilities at the site currently estimated to cost
$800 million may incur a cost overrun of $300 million to $400
million, he said.  Fortescue shares fell 1.6 percent to A$6.36 at the close of
trading in Sydney, bringing losses this year to 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
