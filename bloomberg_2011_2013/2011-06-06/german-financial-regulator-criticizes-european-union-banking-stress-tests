Germany ’s top financial regulator
lashed out at the European Union’s bank stress tests, saying the
standards adopted by the agency carrying them out lack
“legitimacy.”  The  European Banking Authority  used a definition of capital
that deviates from global rules “with consequences no-one can
gauge,” Bafin Chairman  Jochen Sanio  said in the introduction to
the German regulator’s annual report today. The EBA lacks
“clear, defined corporate-governance structures, which alone
could guarantee process legitimacy,” he said.  “This gives cause for concern in the future,” said Sanio,
who will turn 65 in January. “It would be regretful if the
European banking supervisor would be discredited right at the
beginning of its work.”  An association of German public sector banks criticized the
tests in April, saying they would put them at a disadvantage and
convey false signals to the market. Under the EBA tests, lenders
won’t be allowed to count in their results some types of non-
voting capital, known as silent participations, which are
permitted by German bank supervisors.  The EBA created its capital definition for the stress tests
without “legal, defined competence, let alone legitimacy,”
Sanio said today.  “I think the Germans are feeling a bit picked on, because
they’ve been asked to bail out several Euro countries and now
their banks are being penalized for the way they structure their
capital,” James Babicz, head of risk at analytics company SAS
U.K., said in a telephone interview.  Results Delayed  An EBA spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a phone
call seeking comment.  The publication of the stress-test results may be delayed
until July, a  European Banking Authority  official said last
week. They had been scheduled to be released this month. A date
for publication hasn’t been set, because the EBA must ensure it
is satisfied with the data the banks submitted, the EBA official
said. The EBA delayed publication because of concerns about
 Spain ’s savings banks,  El Economista  said last week, citing
people in the financial industry it didn’t name.  Europe-wide regulators established by the EU last year will
now “dominate the scene,” cutting back Bafin’s powers and
influence, Sanio said. Many of their decisions will be made
under a “one country, one vote” system, so it isn’t yet clear
whether Germany can have much influence on them, he said.  “One thing is clear: there are ‘interesting times’ waiting
ahead of us -- according to Chinese understanding, a rather
unpleasant prospect,” Sanio wrote.  Not Tough Enough  The EBA said on its  website  earlier this year that, under
the stress-test scenarios, banks will be expected to maintain a
Core Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 5 percent. Last year’s
tests, which allowed national regulators to use their own
capital definitions, were criticized by bank analysts for not
being tough enough. Lenders in the 27-nation region were shown
by regulators to need only 3.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion) of
new capital, about a 10th of the lowest analyst estimate.  This year’s tests will include a review of how banks would
handle a 0.5 percent economic contraction in the euro area in
2011 as well as a 15 percent drop in European equity markets.  The EBA tests will also examine the effect of a 75 basis-
point jump in  interest rates  on European sovereign bonds and an
increase in short-term inter-bank financing costs of 125 basis
points. Losses on sovereign bonds held to maturity won’t be
tested, according to the EBA.  To contact the reporter for this story:
