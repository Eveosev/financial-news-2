WestLB AG’s bad bank, Erste
Abwicklungsanstalt, holds 1.1 billion euros ($1.6 billion) of
Greek government debt and said it’s not in talks with European
officials about a possible extension of the bonds’ maturities.  The European Union is preparing a new aid package for
 Greece  that includes a “voluntary” role for investors after
the EU and the  International Monetary Fund  approved the fifth
installment of the country’s 110 billion-euro bailout last week.  “We’re not holding talks about Greek sovereign debt,”
Marie Luise Hoffmann, a spokeswoman for Dusseldorf-based EAA,
said by telephone today.  WestLB needed aid from its owners, which include the German
state of North-Rhine Westphalia, as well as the country’s Soffin
bank-rescue fund after running up losses during the global
financial crisis. The state-owned lender shifted about one-third
of its assets to the bad bank, which it established with the
help of Soffin in December 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
