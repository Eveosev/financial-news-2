Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-
largest planemaker, reiterated that it will wait to see what
 Boeing Co. (BA)  does in the single-aisle aircraft market before
deciding whether to build a 150-seat plane.  “We plan to wait to see what Boeing decides,” Paulo Cesar
de Souza e Silva, president of Embraer’s commercial aviation
unit, said in an interview yesterday in Singapore. “We believe
it’s important to have every piece of information about our
competitors for us to make a sound decision.”  Embraer may build a 150-seat plane in an attempt to break
Airbus and Boeing’s stranglehold on the single-aisle market that
features their best-selling planes. Boeing has said it may make
an announcement later this year on whether it will develop an
all-new plane to replace its 737 after Airbus announced plans to
revamp its rival A320 by giving it new engines.  The new A320neo, due to enter service in 2015, will have
the option of engines from United Technologies Corp.’s Pratt &
Whitney or from  CFM International , a venture between  General
Electric Co. (GE)  and France’s Safran.  Embraer is looking at the same engines for its proposed
150-seat plane, and it may also consider Rolls-Royce, said
Silva, who’s attending the annual general meeting of the
 International Air Transport Association . London-based Rolls
could offer an open-rotor engine design, he said.  “I think Rolls-Royce can also make a good proposition in
terms of the design of the engine,” he said.
