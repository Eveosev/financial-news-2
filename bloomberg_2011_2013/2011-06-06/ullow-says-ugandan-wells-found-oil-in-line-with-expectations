Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the U.K.-based
operator of Ghana’s Jubilee field, said it found oil in line
with pre-drill expectations at sites off the coast of Ghana and
onshore in  Uganda .  At the Jobi-East-1 in Uganda the company confirmed that
there is oil in two areas of the reservoir totaling 15 meters
(49 feet) of net pay, London-based Tullow said in a statement
today. The explorer’s Mpyo-3 well uncovered 21 meters of oil-
bearing reservoir sands.  “The Jobi-East-1 and Mpyo-3 well results mark an excellent
start to this next phase of our exploration and appraisal
campaign in the Lake Albert Rift Basin,” Exploration Director
Angus McCoss said in the statement.  Uganda, East Africa’s third-biggest economy, is on the cusp
of an oil boom with Tullow expected to start pumping crude and
gas from the Lake Albert Basin in 2012. The country has an
estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil, with about 1 billion
barrels in proven reserves, according to Tullow.  In  Ghana , where the London-based company drilled over a
gross vertical interval of 300 meters, Tullow found 100 meters
of low porosity sandstone and 3 meters of 40 degree oil pay.
Drilling at all three sites has been suspended until the company
is ready to conduct product testing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
