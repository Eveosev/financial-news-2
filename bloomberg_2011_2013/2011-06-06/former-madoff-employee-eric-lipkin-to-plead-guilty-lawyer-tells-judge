Former Bernard Madoff employee Eric
Lipkin will plead guilty to federal criminal charges stemming
from the biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history, his lawyer said.  Attorney James Filan told the judge of his client’s wishes
today in  Manhattan  federal court. Lipkin’s agreement to admit to
six separate crimes was announced last week by federal
prosecutors in a letter to U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is presiding over the case.  Lipkin, 37, faces as long as 70 years in prison. Madoff is
serving a 150-year sentence in a federal prison in  North
Carolina .  Five former Madoff employees have been charged by Manhattan
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office in the case and are
awaiting trial before Swain in connection with the money
manager’s multibillion-dollar fraud. All have pleaded not
guilty.  Annette Bongiorno, who recruited investors and helped run
Madoff’s investment advisory office, and Joann Crupi, of
Westfield,  New Jersey , were arrested and charged by the U.S. in
November.  The U.S. previously charged Daniel Bonventre, Madoff’s ex-
operations chief, and Jerome O’Hara and George Perez, both
former programmers who worked at Madoff’s investment business.
No trial date has been set.  The case is U.S. v. Lipkin, 10-CR-228, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
