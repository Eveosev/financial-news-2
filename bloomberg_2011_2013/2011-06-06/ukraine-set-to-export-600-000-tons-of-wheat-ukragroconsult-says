Ukraine will probably export 600,000
metric tons of wheat this month after quotas on outbound
shipments of the grain were abolished last week, according to
UkrAgroConsult.  Barley deliveries will be around 300,000 tons in June, the
Kiev-based researcher said by e-mail today. Caps on exports of
the grain also were scrapped last week. Quotas on corn shipments
were removed in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
