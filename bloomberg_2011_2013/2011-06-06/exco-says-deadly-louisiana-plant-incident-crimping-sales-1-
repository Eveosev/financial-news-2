Exco Resources Inc. (XCO)  said a fatal
incident May 28 at a natural-gas processing plant in Louisiana
jointly owned with  BG Group Plc (BG/)  is crimping sales and costing
the company about $35,000 a day to route the heating and power
plant fuel to market through alternate pipelines.  The plant, which is located north of Coushatta, Louisiana,
was shut immediately and a second plant in DeSoto Parish,
Louisiana, was closed while the company investigates the cause
of the incident that killed an Exco employee and injured a
contract worker, Dallas-based Exco said today in a statement.
The statement didn’t describe the incident.  Closing the plants, each capable of processing 450 million
cubic feet of natural gas per day, lowered Exco’s production by
as much as 100 million cubic feet per day for six days, the
company said. As of today, as much as 20 million cubic feet of
production remains shut because of shipment limits on pipelines
used while the plants are closed, it said.  The plants are owned by TGGT Holdings LLC, a 50 percent
joint venture of Exco and BG Group, according to the statement.  The announcement was made before regular trading began on
U.S. markets. Exco fell 80 cents, or 4 percent, to $19.25 June 3
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
fallen 4.5 percent since May 27. BG Group, based in Reading,
U.K., rose 4 pence to 1,346 pence today at 12:47 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
