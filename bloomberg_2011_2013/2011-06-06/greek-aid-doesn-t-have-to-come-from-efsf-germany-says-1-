Any additional financial assistance
for  Greece  being negotiated by European officials doesn’t have
to come out of the 750 billion-euro ($1.1 trillion) European
bailout fund, the German Finance Ministry said.  It’s not yet clear under which “regime” any fresh bailout
aid would come from, though it may not be financing from the
European Financial Stability Facility, Finance Ministry
spokesman Martin Kreienbaum said. A finalized report concerning
Greece is expected sometime in the middle of this week, he said.  “It’s not necessarily the case that it has to be the
EFSF,” Kreienbaum told reporters today in Berlin.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  supports the position of Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  that creditors should be involved in
a new round of aid to Greece, although an obligatory involvement
isn’t part of a legal framework before 2013, chief government
spokesman Steffen Seibert said. Schaeuble briefed the Cabinet in
Berlin today on Greece, Seibert said, without giving any details
of what was discussed.  The government will reach a unified position on any extra
aid after it receives the report being compiled by the European
Union, the  European Central Bank  and the  International Monetary
Fund , Seibert said.  “The chancellor supports the finance minister in his
position, but there can be no unified position on the part of
the government until this report is read and analyzed,” Seibert
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
