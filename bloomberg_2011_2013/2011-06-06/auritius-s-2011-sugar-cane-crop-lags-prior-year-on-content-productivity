Sucrose content of Mauritius’s 2011
sugar cane crop is lagging behind last year and 2009, the
Mauritius Sugar Industry Research Institute said.  Stalk height is 1.1 percent below 2010 and 6.4 percent
below “normal,” the Reduit-based institute said in an e-mailed
report dated June 3.  Sugar makes up 63 percent of Mauritian agriculture exports,
according to the Port Louis-based Chamber of Agriculture.
Production in 2010 was 452,518 metric tons of sugar, according
to the chamber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
