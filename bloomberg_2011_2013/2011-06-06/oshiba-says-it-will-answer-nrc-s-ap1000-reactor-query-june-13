Toshiba Corp. (6502)  will respond to the
U.S.  Nuclear Regulatory Commission ’s questions about its new
reactor design on June 13, the company said.  “We wanted to take an additional week to make sure
everything’s complete,” said Scott Shaw, a spokesman for
 Westinghouse Electric Co. , a unit of Tokyo-based Toshiba. The
company has resolved “all of the issues” raised by the NRC,
Shaw said today in an interview.  NRC Chairman  Gregory Jaczko  said May 20 the agency needed
more information from Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania-based
Westinghouse about the AP1000 reactor before it would be
approved. Westinghouse needed to complete studies showing how
parts of the plant will perform during earthquakes and reactor
accidents, according to the NRC.  The U.S. hasn’t approved a construction license for a new
nuclear-power plant in more than three decades. The AP1000 is a
popular design among the U.S. power companies seeking to build
nuclear plants again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
