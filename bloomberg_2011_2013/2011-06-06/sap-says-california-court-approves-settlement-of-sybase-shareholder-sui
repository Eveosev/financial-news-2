SAP AG (SAP) , the largest maker of business
management software, said it won a California court’s approval
of a settlement of a group lawsuit over its $5.8 billion
acquisition of Sybase Inc. last year.  SAP disclosed the Alameda County court’s approval today in
a statement distributed by PR Newswire. The investors’ lawsuit
claimed the price SAP paid to Sybase shareholders was too low
and that information about the acquisition was “insufficient,”
according to the statement.  Under the settlement, investors were given additional
disclosures about the acquisition, according to the statement. A
settlement amount wasn’t disclosed. SAP said the settlement
applies to investors who held Sybase shares between May 12 and
July 29, 2010.  SAP acquired Sybase, a maker of database and mobile-
computing software, to add products that help corporate
customers run applications on mobile devices. SAP, based in
Walldorf,  Germany , has made only two large acquisitions in its
39-year history: Sybase and business-intelligence company
 Business Objects  for 4.8 billion euros in 2007.  SAP spokesman Andy Kendzie didn’t immediately return a call
and e-mail seeking comment.  The case is Casey v. Sybase, RG1O5 15026, Alameda County
Superior Court (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
