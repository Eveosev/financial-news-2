Ecuador’s cost of living rose the
most in 15 months in May from a year earlier, led by rising food
and clothing expenses, the National Statistics and Census
Institute said today.  Consumer prices rose 4.23 percent from the previous May and
increased 0.35 percent from April, the agency said in a report
on its  website . Producer prices fell 0.04 percent from the
previous month and increased 5.9 percent from May 2010,
according to the report.  Food prices in  South America ’s seventh-biggest economy,
which uses the  U.S. dollar  as its official currency, gained 6.96
percent in the 12 months through May as droughts in coastal
areas and flooding in the highland Andes damaged crops,
according to the report. Global commodity price increases,
internal supply difficulties and rising consumer demand are also
adding to pressure on prices, the Economic Policy Ministry said
in a June 2 report.  “Real incomes may fall slightly in the coming months
because of supply problems caused by the irregular weather,”
the ministry report said. “The important increase in raw
material prices in global markets will also have an effect on
internal inflation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
