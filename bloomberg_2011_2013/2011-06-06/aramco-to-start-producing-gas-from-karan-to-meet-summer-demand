Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest
crude exporter, will start producing 400 million cubic feet a
day of gas from Karan, its first offshore non-associated
natural-gas field, to meet peak power demand.  The Persian Gulf field off Jubail in the east of the
country will start in the northern hemisphere summer and
production will rise to 1.5 billion cubic feet a day of gas by
2012, the company said today in its 2010 annual review.  Karan will produce about 1.8 billion cubic feet a day of
dry gas when completed in 2013 to support the company’s master
gas system, it said in the review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
