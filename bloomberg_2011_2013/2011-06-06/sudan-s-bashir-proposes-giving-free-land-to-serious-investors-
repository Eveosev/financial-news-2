Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir
proposed that the African country offer land for free to
“serious investors,” with priority for “vital projects,”
state-run SUNA  news agency  reported today.  A timeline for these projects must be laid out and the land
would not be designated for any investors before their
seriousness is proven, the news agency reported Bashir as saying
in a speech in Khartoum,  Sudan ’s capital.  Bashir said that priority would be given to projects that
the country needs most, such as wheat and sugar production, SUNA
said. The Khartoum-based news agency did not say whether the
proposal would be voted into law or when it would be
implemented.  Southern Sudan  will assume control of 75 percent of Sudan’s
daily oil production of 490,000 barrels when it is declared
independent from Sudan on July 9. The Sudanese government is
working to diversify its exports away from oil to cope with the
secession of the oil-rich south, SUNA quoted Bashir as saying
June 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
