Turkish bonds and the lira declined
after Moody’s Investors Service said there’s a “rapid
deterioration” in the current-account deficit that may pressure
the country’s rating.  Yields on two-year benchmark bonds increased six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage points, to 8.94 percent at the 5 p.m.
close in Istanbul, rising for a second day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The lira traded down 0.5 percent to
1.5815 per dollar, falling the most in a week.  Turkey’s credit rating may come under pressure should it
have difficulty financing the current-account gap,  Sarah
Carlson , an analyst with Moody’s, said in an e-mailed response
to questions. The country’s reliance on portfolio investment
flows to fund the current-account deficit make very robust
fiscal fundamentals even more important, she said. Turkey will
hold parliamentary elections on June 12.  “Moody’s caused sales in the lira but the bonds gave a
bigger reaction,” Eren Yardimci, a currency trader at Akbank
TAS in Istanbul, said by telephone. Moody’s rates Turkish credit
Ba2, two notches below investment grade, with a positive
outlook.  The  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  of stocks snapped two days of
declines, rising 1.1 percent to 63,516.83.  “Some of the market players do still expect rating
upgrades after the general elections, but Moody’s statements
also confirm that  Turkey ’s credit rating will not be upgraded in
the short-term,” Ozgur Altug, chief economist at BGC Partners
in Istanbul, said in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
