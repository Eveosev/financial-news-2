Spring grains in Russia’s Black Earth
area may be threatened by hot, dry weather if conditions don’t
improve in the next 10 days, according to  Russia’s Federal
Hydrometeorological Center .  “Temperatures exceeded 30 degrees centigrade for the past
several days there,” Roman Vilfand, director of the center told
Bloomberg by phone today, adding that the area south of Moscow
including the Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Lipetsk, Tambov regions
has been hot and dry since May 10. There is enough moisture in
the ground from winter snow melting and early spring rainfalls
for now, but if there isn’t more precipitation crops could
suffer, he said.  Black Earth Farming Ltd. said there is a "50-50" chance of
drought this year. If the high temperatures persist the harvest
will be at risk, said Michael Shneyderman, the chief financial
officer of the group, which has 328,000 hectares (803,000 acres)
of land in the area under its control.  Vilfand said the Kursk, Belgorod and western part of
Saratov regions are on alert for forest fires.  The “drying out of upper soil layers is starting” in the
Black Earth area, Vilfand said, adding the situation in the rest
of  Russia ’s Central federal district is “just normal”.  “It is a very good situation for reaping winter crops,”
Vilfand said. If the heat continues for another 10 days, it will
be dangerous for spring wheat, barley and other grains, he said,
declining to comment on the rain forecast for June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
