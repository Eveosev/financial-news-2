The U.S. will seek to extend the
African Growth and Opportunities Act, said Jose Fernandez, the
U.S. assistant secretary of state for economic, energy and
business affairs.  African nations aren’t making enough use of the trade
agreement’s priveleges, Fernandez said in a speech in
Johannesburg today. AGOA expires in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
