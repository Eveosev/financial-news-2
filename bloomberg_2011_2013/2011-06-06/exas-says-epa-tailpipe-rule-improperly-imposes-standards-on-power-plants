Texas  said the Environmental
Protection Agency’s Tailpipe Rule on greenhouse-gas emissions
from motor vehicles improperly imposes new regulations on
industrial facilities.  Texas and eight other states made the claim in a lawsuit
challenging the rule in a federal appeals court in  Washington .
The states allege the EPA wrongly used regulations put in place
before the Tailpipe Rule to set greenhouse-gas standards for
stationary sources, such as steel mills and power plants.  “The Tailpipe Rule thus became the sine qua non of one of
the most expansive and onerous regulatory programs ever
promulgated in the United States,” the states said in the June
3 filing.  The Tailpipe Rule set emissions and mileage standards for
new vehicles beginning in 2016. The rule was jointly written by
the EPA and the U.S. Transportation Department.  The states allege the EPA “expressly refused” to consider
the costs of complying with the stationary source regulations.
The states filed a challenge to the rule shortly after it was
completed in April 2010.  Cathy Milbourn, an EPA spokeswoman, declined to immediately
comment on the filing.  The case is Coalition for Responsible Regulation Inc. v.
Environmental Protection Agency, 10-109,  U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
