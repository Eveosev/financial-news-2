The discount for West  Texas  Sour
crude widened after  Western Refining Inc. (WNR)  said its El Paso
refinery in Texas was affected by a  power failure  earlier today.  “We lost power from El Paso Electric early this morning,”
Gary Hanson, a spokesman for Western, said in an e-mail. “Power
has been restored and we are in the process of restarting our
units.”  Western processed 16,413 barrels a day of sour crude at its
El Paso refinery during the first quarter, the company said in a
statement May 5. The plant has a capacity of 128,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  West Texas Sour’s discount widened 5 cents to $2 a barrel
versus West Texas Intermediate at 1:51 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost 5 cents to $16.70 over
WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s was unchanged at $16.25 over the
benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened 15 cents to $11 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium added 35 cents to $10.60.  Thunder Horse’s premium gained 25 cents to $16 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon’s premium added 25 cents to
$10.25 a barrel.  The premium for Syncrude weakened 15 cents to $8.25 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 75 cents to
$20 a barrel after TransCanada Corp. restarted its 591,000-
barrel-a-day Keystone pipeline after the line was shut following
a leak May 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
