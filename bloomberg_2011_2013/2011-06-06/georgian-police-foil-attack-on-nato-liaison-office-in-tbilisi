Georgian police foiled an attack in
the capital Tbilisi after arresting a man planning to plant a
bomb near the NATO representation office in the city.  The suspect was promised $2,000 to activate the device near
the office. It was given to him by Russian border troops
stationed in Akhalgori,  Georgia â€™s occupied region, the  interior
ministry  said on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
