Former Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s lawyer said a case against his client is a
“farce” and that Ben Ali doesn’t own real estate or bank
accounts outside  Tunisia .  “Forced to take on the role of scapegoat based on lies and
injustice, President Ben Ali has decided not to remain silent,”
Jean-Yves Le Borgne said in an e-mailed statement today. “The
case against him is just a farce whose only goal is to represent
a symbolic break with the past.”  Tunisian authorities have charged Ben Ali with crimes
including the murder of protesters and conspiring against the
internal security of the state. Protests against Ben Ali’s rule
culminated in his Jan. 14 flight to  Saudi Arabia  and inspired a
wave of popular uprisings in the  Middle East  that led to the
ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and revolts in Libya,
Syria and Yemen.  Ben Ali “has neither real estate, nor bank accounts, in
 France  or in any other foreign country,” the statement said.  A trial in absentia for Ben Ali on charges of possessing
drugs and weapons is expected to start “within the coming few
days,” Tunisian Justice Ministry spokesman Kazim Zein el-
Abedeen said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
