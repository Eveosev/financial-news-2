Six Somali pirates were jailed by a
Somaliland court for capturing an Italian vessel in April 2008
and receiving a $3 million ransom.  The Berbera Regional Court gave five of the pirates eight-
year jail terms, while a sixth received a sentence of five years
after he confessed to the crime, Osman Ibrahim Direi, head of
the court, said yesterday. The six men were captured by
Somalilandâ€™s coast guard on March 24 near the coastal town of
Maydh.  Somaliland, a breakaway enclave in northern  Somalia , in
March opened a maximum-security prison built with United Nations
funding to incarcerate convicted pirates.  An increase in pirate attacks, spurred by a 36-fold jump in
ransom payments in five years, has threatened vessels carrying
20 percent of world trade and raised expenses for shippers.
Costs linked to piracy may reach $13 billion to $15 billion by
2015 as global trade rebounds and pirates operate over wider
areas, according to research firm  Geopolicity Inc.   To contact the reporter on this story:
