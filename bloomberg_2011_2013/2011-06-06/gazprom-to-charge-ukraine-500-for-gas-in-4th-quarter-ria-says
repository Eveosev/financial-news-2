OAO Gazprom Chief Executive Officer
 Alexei Miller  said Ukraine is concerned that fourth-quarter gas
prices for  Europe  may reach $500 per 1,000 cubic meters.  European gas sold under long-term contracts may climb to
that level by the end of the year because of the link to the
price of oil and refined products, Miller told reporters today
in Sochi, according to Moscow-based Gazprom’s press service. He
was reiterating comments made in April that European sales may
reach “records.”  This is worrying Ukrainian consumers, Miller said,
according to the press service. Ukraine’s Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  is scheduled to visit Moscow tomorrow.  Gazprom doesn’t plan to change the price formula for
Ukraine, Interfax said, citing Miller.  Miller didn’t give an estimate for the price it plans to
charge Ukraine, the press service said, commenting on earlier
reports by RIA Novosti and Interfax. Ukraine now buys gas at
“market level,” with a 30 percent discount that is capped at
$100 per 1,000 cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
