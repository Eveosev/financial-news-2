Munich Re ’s Ludger Arnoldussen, the
management board member responsible for Asia, said the
likelihood of a large earthquake in  Tokyo  hasn’t increased after
the March catastrophe in Japan,  Handelsblatt  reported today.  Such a disaster in Tokyo would cost the company a maximum
of 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion), Arnoldussen was cited as
saying by the newspaper. A winter storm in Europe or a hurricane
in the U.S. would cost the reinsurer as much as 3 billion euros
in a worst-case scenario, he said, according to Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
