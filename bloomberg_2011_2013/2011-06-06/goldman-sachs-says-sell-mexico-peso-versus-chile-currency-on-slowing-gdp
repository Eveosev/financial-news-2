Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is
recommending clients sell  Mexico ’s peso against the Chilean
currency because Mexico will post a “subdued pace of growth”
in the second quarter of the year.  Growth in the two Latin American countries is diverging as
the slowing U.S. economy undermines Mexico’s industries,
analysts led by  Robin Brooks  wrote in a note to clients today.
In Chile, “favorable” credit growth and “strong” industrial
and retail sales suggest robust “growth momentum,” the
analysts wrote.  The Mexican currency may fall to 38 per Chilean peso from
39.99 today, according to Goldman Sachs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
