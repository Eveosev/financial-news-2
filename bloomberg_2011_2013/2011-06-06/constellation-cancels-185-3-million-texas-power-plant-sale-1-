Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG) 
canceled the $185.3 million sale of a  Texas  power plant to High
Plains Diversified Energy Corp. as the proposed buyer prepares
to shut down.  Constellation, based in Baltimore, announced the decision
to end the sale of the 550-megawatt Quail Run plant in Odessa in
a statement today.  High Plains, based in Lubbock, Texas, also had a $335
million agreement to buy a plant from Public Service Enterprise
Group Inc. canceled last week. The deals were terminated after
High Plains lost a lawsuit challenging its ability to issue
municipal bonds to finance the acquisitions.  The West Texas Municipal Power Agency, which created High
Plains in 2008 as part of a public-private partnership with
Republic Power Partners LP, voted unanimously last week to
dissolve the development agreement and to end its funding, Gary
Brown, president of the agency, said on June 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
