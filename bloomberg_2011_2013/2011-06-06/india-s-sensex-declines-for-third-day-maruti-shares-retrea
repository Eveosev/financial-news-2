India’s benchmark stock advanced for
the first time in three days as a decline in crude prices eased
concern that higher energy costs may stoke inflation.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the nation’s biggest
mortgage lender, led a rally among peers. Oil dropped for a
second day in  New York  on signs of a slowdown in U.S. demand as
OPEC members prepare to meet to discuss output quotas.  Tata
Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software services
exporter, climbed 1.3 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index rose 54.28, or
0.3 percent, to 18,430.76, according to preliminary closing
prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The Sensex has lost 10 percent
this year amid concern higher borrowing costs will crimp
earnings. Rising consumer prices and a 40 percent gain in  oil
prices  the past year have forced the central bank to raise
 interest rates  nine times in 15 months.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
 India  Ltd. added 0.3 percent to 5535.75 and its June futures
settled at 5,536.50. The BSE 200 Index increased 0.2 percent to
2,286.57.  To contact the reporter on this story:
