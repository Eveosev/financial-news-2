Captain  Andrew Strauss  was dismissed
on the second ball as England reached 149-2 in the second
cricket Test against Sri Lanka, with a draw looking likely.  Strauss, who hadn’t scored, was trapped leg-before-wicket by
Chanaka Welegedara on the fourth day of a weather-disrupted
match at Lord’s in London.  Jonathan Trott  was bowled by Rangana
Herath for 58, in response to Sri Lanka’s 479 all out. The hosts
have a lead of 156.  Alastair Cook has scored 61 in England’s second innings
and  Kevin Pietersen  is on 15. The hosts scored 486 all out in
their first innings.  Play started at 1:10 p.m. today, after a rain delay, and
was suspended at about 5:20 p.m. for bad light before resuming
about 20 minutes later.  Sri Lanka  was on 372-3 at the start of the day’s play, and
lost its remaining seven wickets for 107 runs. Visiting captain
 Tillakaratne Dilshan  made 193. Steven Finn took 4-108, and
Graeme Swann 3-101.  Yesterday, fewer than 40 overs were played because of the
weather.  The odds on a draw are about 1-10 on betting exchange
Betfair, meaning a successful 10-pound bet would yield a pound
in profit.  England won the rain-shortened first Test by an innings and
14 runs in Cardiff after bowling out Sri Lanka for 82 in its
second innings when a draw appeared most likely.  The teams are scheduled to play three Tests, a Twenty20
match, and five one-day internationals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
