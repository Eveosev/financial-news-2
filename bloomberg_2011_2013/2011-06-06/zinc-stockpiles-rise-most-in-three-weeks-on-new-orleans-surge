Zinc inventories tracked by the
London Metal Exchange climbed the most in almost three weeks,
driven by increases in  New Orleans  warehouses.  Stockpiles rose 12,850 metric tons, or 1.5 percent, to
866,875 tons, daily LME figures showed. Thatâ€™s the highest level
since June 1995, and the increase was the biggest since May 18,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories jumped 12,925 tons in New Orleans and slipped
75 tons in  Chicago . New Orleans zinc stocks are up 31 percent
this year and account for 59 percent of the total.  Orders to draw aluminum from warehouses, or canceled
warrants, climbed 15,125 tons, or 2.9 percent, to 529,775 tons,
the highest level since at least October 1997. Most of the
increase took place in Busan,  South Korea . Total aluminum
stockpiles fell for an eighth day, declining 7,475 tons to 4.67
million tons.  Copper inventories rose 2,225 tons to 475,700 tons, up 36
percent from the 2010 low on Dec. 10. Canceled warrants fell 750
tons to 18,900 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
