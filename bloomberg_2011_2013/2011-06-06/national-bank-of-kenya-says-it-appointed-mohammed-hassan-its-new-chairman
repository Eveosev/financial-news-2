National Bank of Kenya Ltd. (NBKL) , a state-
owned lender, jumped the most in almost a week after it
appointed Mohammed Hassan as its new chairman.  The stock of NBK, as the lender is known, rose 0.7 percent
to 34 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, the
biggest advance since May 31.  Sylvia Kitonga and Erastus Mwongera were also elected as
directors of the bank at an annual general meeting on June 3,
the Nairobi-based lender said in a statement e-mailed by the
city’s stock exchange today.  “The change of directors is to allow NBK to get
privatized,” Francis Mwangi, an analyst at Nairobi-based
African Alliance Securities Kenya Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. “This talk has been in the market for several
years and now it seems there is some momentum in that
direction.”  Hassan is a former managing director of Dyer & Blair
Investment Bank Ltd.,  Kenya ’s second-biggest brokerage by value
of transactions in the 12 months to Dec. 31, according to data
from the  Capital Markets Authority .  To contact the reporter on this story:
